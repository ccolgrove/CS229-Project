'''GPE''' (an [[acronym]] for '''[[GNOME]] Palmtop Environment''' or '''[[GNU]] Palmtop Environment''' depending on whom you ask) is a [[graphical user interface]] environment for [[handheld computer]]s, such as [[palmtop]]s and [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), running the [[Linux]] operating system. GPE is a complete environment of software components and applications which makes it possible to use a Linux handheld for tasks such as [[personal information management]] (PIM), audio playback, email, and web browsing.

Available under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] and the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], GPE is [[free software]].

==Supported devices==

GPE is bundled with embedded [[Linux distribution]]s targeting the following platforms:

* [[Sharp Zaurus]]
* [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[iPAQ]]
* Hewlett-Packard [[Jornada (PDA)|Jornada]] 72x
* [[Siemens AG]] [[SIMpad]] SL4

In addition, GPE maintainers and the open source community are developing ports for additional devices:

* [[GamePark Holdings]] [[GP2x]]
* [[Nokia 770 Internet Tablet|Nokia 770]]
* [[Nokia N800]]
* [[Palm TX]]
* [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]] [[Treo 650]][http://www.grack.com/programming/misc/TreoLinux.html]
* [[HTC Universal]]
* [[HTC Typhoon]]
* [[HTC Tornado]]
* [[HTC Wizard]]
* [[HTC Apache]] [http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/HTCApache]

On February 5, 2007, The GPE project announced [http://gpephone.linuxtogo.org/ GPE Phone Edition], a new variant of GPE developed for mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxtogo.org/new-project-gpe-phone-edition |title=New Project: GPE Phone Edition |accessdate=2007-08-23 |last=Boor |first=Florian |date=2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Gpe-2.7-sharp-zaurus-c1000.png|thumb|GPE on a Sharp Zaurus C1000]]

GPE is a [[X Window System]] based GUI, utilizing [[GTK+]] for interfaces and [[Matchbox (window manager)|Matchbox]] for window management. The project provides an infrastructure for easy and powerful application development by providing core software such as [[shared library|shared libraries]], database schemas, and building on available technology including [[SQLite]], [[D-BUS]], [[GStreamer]] and several more common standards defined by [[freedesktop.org]].

One of the major goals of the GPE project is to encourage people to work on [[free software]] for mobile devices and to experiment with new technologies.

Some of the applications already developed for GPE include:

* ''GPE-Contacts'' - A contacts manager 	
* ''GPE-Calendar'' - The calendar application 	
* ''GPE-Edit'' - A simple text editor	
* ''GPE-Filemanager'' - A file manager with [[MIME type]] and remote access support 	
* ''GPE-Gallery'' - Small and easy to use image viewer 	
* ''GPE-Games'' - A small collection of tiny games	
* ''GPE-Mini-Browser'' - A [[CSS]] and [[Javascript]] compatible compact web browser	
* ''GPE-Sketchbook'' - Create notes and sketches 	
* ''GPE-Soundbite'' - A voice memo tool
* ''GPE-ToDo'' - A task list manager
* ''GPE-Timesheet'' - Track time spend on tasks
* ''Starling'' - A GStreamer based audio player
* ''[[VLC media player|VLC]]'' - A [[Media player (application software)|media player]]

GPE's PIM applications (GPE-Contacts, GPE-Calendar, GPE-ToDo) can be synchronized with their desktop and web counterparts (such as [[Novell Evolution]], [[Mozilla Sunbird]] and [[Google Calendar]]) through the use of ''GPE-Syncd'' and the [[OpenSync (software)|OpenSync]] framework.

GPE also contains a number of GUI utilities for configuring [[Wireless LAN|802.11 Wireless LAN]], [[Bluetooth]], [[IrDA]], [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]], [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|ALSA]], [[Ipkg|Package Management]], among others.

A mobile [[push e-mail]] client based on the [[Tinymail]] framework is in development.

==Linux distributions==
[[File:Gpe-2.7-browser-sharp-zaurus-c1000.png|thumb|Wikipedia viewed with the GPE Mini-Browser]]

GPE can be found as a primary environment in the following embedded Linux distributions:

* [[ÃngstrÃ¶m distribution|ÃngstrÃ¶m]]
* [[Familiar Linux]]
* [[OpenZaurus]]

Though it may not be as highly supported as the distributions listed above, GPE is also available through package management utilities in the following distributions:

* [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]
* [[Debian]]
* [[Internet Tablet OS]]

==Controversy==

There are ongoing controversies surrounding the GPE project regarding a change of hosting service, ownership of an [[IRC]] channel, and a trademark dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/05/24/157218 | title= GPE project and Handhelds.org in acrimonious trademark dispute | accessdate=2007-08-18 |last=Willis |first=Nathan |date=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/236287/ |title= Whose project is it anyway? | accessdate=2007-08-22 |last=Corbet |first=Jonathan |date=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web hosting===

Serious issues first began developing over a proposed change of hosting service. GPE had been hosted at [http://handhelds.org Handhelds.org] since April 2002. Some of GPE's developers suggested, and later followed through with, a move to [http://linuxtogo.org Linuxtogo.org] by October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.gpe/5523 |title=New home for GPE? |accessdate=2007-08-23 |author=Nils Faerber |date=2006-08-17 |newsgroup=gmane.comp.handhelds.gpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handhelds.org responded by removing the user accounts of the departing developers, and any links or reference to the new [http://gpe.linuxtogo.org GPE Linuxtogo.org] location on the original [http://gpe.handhelds.org GPE Handhelds.org] site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/GPEProject?action=diff&amp;date1=1167946855&amp;date2=1164453993 |title= Diff for &quot;GPEProject&quot; - Handhelds.org MoinMoin Wiki |accessdate= 2007-08-23 |date=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IRC channel===

Both parties claim ownership of the #gpe [[IRC]] channel located on [[freenode]]. Freenode has placed the channel in trust, or locked, until both sides can come to an agreement. Subsequently, Linuxtogo.org currently uses #gpe-project, and Handhelds.org uses #handhelds-gpe, both on Freenode.net.

===Trademark===

George France, a Handhelds.org administrator, has filed for trademark registration with the [[USPTO]] for GPE, in addition to [[OPIE user interface|OPIE]] and [[Ipkg]] as of March 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow?SRCH=Y&amp;isSubmitted=true&amp;details=&amp;SELECT=US+Serial+No&amp;TEXT=77123546# |title=US Serial No: 77123546, Application |accessdate=2007-08-23 |date=2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 25, 2007, the USPTO declined to accept a screenshot of the Handhelds.org GPE website as proof of Handhelds.org's ownership, and in addition requested a better specimen for a âGPE productâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.uspto.gov/external/portal/tow?SRCH=Y&amp;isSubmitted=true&amp;details=&amp;SELECT=US+Serial+No&amp;TEXT=77123546# |title=US Serial No: 77123546, Offc Action Outgoing |accessdate=2007-08-23 |date=2007-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Handhelds.org, and [[Open Source Initiative|OSI]] board member [[Russ Nelson]], assert that the GPE project was given over to Handhelds.org for public development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/article.php?story=20070525101908558 |title= The backstory to the trademarks |accessdate=2007-08-23 |last=Nelson |first=Russ |date=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPE developers working at Linuxtogo.org maintain that they represent the active GPE project, and Handhelds.org was only a hosting provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.ipaq.general/18811 |title=Re: crosscompiling question, ...Maybe this could be hosted on sourceforge.handhelds.org?... |accessdate=2007-08-23 |author=Nils Faerber |date=2001-12-21 |newsgroup= gmane.comp.handhelds.ipaq.general}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fl0rian.wordpress.com/2007/05/23/threatened-update/ |title= Threatened - update |accessdate=2007-08-23 |last=Boor |first=Florian |date=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they point out that the GPE project existed before it was hosted on Handhelds.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.ipaq.general/18846 |title= GPE - GNU PDA Environment |accessdate=2007-08-23 |author=Nils Faerber |date=2001-12-22 |newsgroup= gmane.comp.handhelds.ipaq.general}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USPTO issued a final rejection regarding the GPE trademark on February 27, 2008. George France amended the application (removing references to [[GNU]] and Linux). The GPE trademark was officially published for opposition June 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77123546 |title=Latest Status Info |accessdate=2008-07-01 |date=2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite George France's impending personal GPE trademark, the core GPE development team at Linuxtogo.org has abandoned much of the Handhelds.org GPE infrastructure. Linuxtogo.org developers have switched GPE to a new bootloader and replaced IPKG with OPKG, and made major changes to the GPE gui applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fl0rian.wordpress.com/2008/03/28/gpe-trademark-rejected/ |title= GPE trademark rejected |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Boor |first=Florian |date=2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
