A '''penetration test''', occasionally '''pentest''', is a method of evaluating the [[computer security|security]] of a [[computer system]] or [[computer network|network]] by simulating an attack from malicious outsiders (who do not have an authorized means of accessing the organization's systems) and malicious insiders (who have some level of authorized access).  The process involves an active analysis of the system for any potential vulnerabilities that could result from poor or improper system configuration, both known and unknown hardware or software flaws, or operational weaknesses in process or technical countermeasures. This analysis is carried out from the position of a potential attacker and can involve active exploitation of security vulnerabilities. 

Security issues uncovered through the penetration test are presented to the system's owner.  Effective penetration tests will couple this information with an accurate assessment of the potential impacts to the organization and outline a range of technical and procedural countermeasures to reduce risks.  

Penetration tests are valuable for several reasons:
# Determining the feasibility of a particular set of attack vectors
# Identifying higher-risk vulnerabilities that result from a combination of lower-risk vulnerabilities exploited in a particular sequence
# Identifying vulnerabilities that may be difficult or impossible to detect with automated network or application vulnerability scanning software
# Assessing the magnitude of potential business and operational impacts of successful attacks
# Testing the ability of network defenders to successfully detect and respond to the attacks
# Providing evidence to support increased investments in security personnel and technology

Penetration tests are a component of a full [[Information technology security audit|security audit]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  For example, the [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard]] (PCI DSS), and security and auditing standard, requires both annual and ongoing penetration testing (after system changes).

==Black box vs. White box==
Penetration tests can be conducted in several ways. The most common difference is the amount of knowledge of the implementation details of the system being tested that are available to the testers. [[Black box testing]] assumes no prior knowledge of the infrastructure to be tested. The testers must first determine the location and extent of the systems before commencing their analysis. At the other end of the spectrum, [[white box testing]] provides the testers with complete knowledge of the infrastructure to be tested, often including network diagrams, source code, and IP addressing information. There are also several variations in between, often known as [[grey box testing|grey box tests]]. Penetration tests can also be described as &quot;full disclosure&quot; (white box), &quot;partial disclosure&quot; (grey box), or &quot;blind&quot; (black box) tests based on the amount of information provided to the testing party.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The relative merits of these approaches are debated. Black box testing simulates an attack from someone who is unfamiliar with the system.  White box testing simulates what might happen during an &quot;inside job&quot; or after a &quot;leak&quot; of sensitive information, where the attacker has access to source code, network layouts, and possibly even some passwords.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The services offered by penetration testing firms span a similar range, from a simple scan of an organization's [[IP address]] space for open ports and identification banners to a full audit of source code for an application.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Rationale ==
A penetration test should be carried out on any computer system that is to be deployed in a hostile environment, in particular any [[Internet]] facing site, before it is deployed. This provides a level of practical assurance that any [[malicious user]] will not be able to penetrate the system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Black box penetration testing is useful in the cases where the tester assumes the role of an outside hacker and tries to intrude into the system without adequate knowledge of it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Risks ==
Penetration testing can be an invaluable technique to any organization's information security program. Basic white box penetration testing is often done as a fully automated inexpensive process. However, black box penetration testing is a labor-intensive activity and requires expertise to minimize the risk to targeted systems. At a minimum, it may slow the organization's networks response time due to [[port scan|network scanning]] and vulnerability scanning. Furthermore, the possibility exists that systems may be damaged in the course of penetration testing and may be rendered inoperable, even though the organization benefits in
knowing that the system could have been rendered inoperable by an intruder. Although this risk is mitigated by the use of experienced penetration testers, it can never be fully eliminated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Methodologies ==
[[The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual]] is a peer-reviewed methodology for performing security tests and metrics. The OSSTMM test cases are divided into five channels which collectively test: information and data controls, personnel security awareness levels, [[fraud]] and [[Social engineering (computer security)|social engineering]] control levels, computer and [[telecommunications networks]], wireless devices, mobile devices, [[physical security]] access controls, security processes, and physical locations such as buildings, perimeters, and military bases.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The OSSTMM focuses on the technical details of exactly which items need to be tested, what to do before, during, and after a security test, and how to measure the results. OSSTMM is also known for its [[Rules of Engagement]] which define for both the tester and the client how the test needs to properly run starting from denying false advertising from testers to how the client can expect to receive the report.  New tests for international best practices, laws, regulations, and ethical concerns are regularly added and updated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) discusses penetration testing in SP800-115.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-42/NIST-SP800-42.pdf Special Publication 800-42, Guideline on Network Security Testing]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-115/SP800-115.pdf |title=Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIST's methodology is less comprehensive than the OSSTMM; however, it is more likely to be accepted by regulatory agencies.  For this reason, NIST refers to the OSSTMM.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Information Systems Security Assessment Framework (ISSAF) is a peer reviewed structured framework from the Open Information Systems Security Group that categorizes information system security assessment into various domains and details specific evaluation or testing criteria for each of these domains. It aims to provide field inputs on security assessment that reflect real life scenarios. The ISSAF should primarily be used to fulfill an organization's security assessment requirements and may additionally be used as a reference for meeting other information security needs. It includes the crucial facet of security processes, and their assessment and hardening to get a complete picture of the vulnerabilities that might exist.  The ISSAF, however, is still in its infancy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Standards and certification==
The process of carrying out a penetration test can reveal sensitive information about an organization. It is for this reason that most security firms are at pains to show that they do not employ ex-[[black hat]] [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] and that all employees adhere to a strict ethical code. There are several professional and government certifications that indicate the firm's trustworthiness and conformance to industry best practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The [http://www.tigerscheme.org Tiger Scheme] is a not for profit scheme that offers three certifications: Associate Security Tester (AST), Qualified Security Team Member (QSTM) and Senior Security Tester (SST).
