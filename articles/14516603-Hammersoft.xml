==Early life==
Born '''Rosalind Ingledew''' in [[New Zealand]] she studied acting there, before moving to the [[United States]].

==Career==
Her movie debut was as an extra in the film ''[[Three Men and a Little Lady]]'', and after guest appearances on a number of daytime dramas dating back to the mid eighties, and a fairly large part in ''[[Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice]]'', as well as several [[independent films]], Rosalind was signed as a main character in [[NBC]]'s popular [[Sci-Fi]] ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'', but she left after one season.  

Like her ''seaQuest'' predecessor ([[Stephanie Beacham]]), she appeared on an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. Allen also appeared alongside then-husband Todd Allen in ''seaQuest DSV'' in the episode &quot;The Siamese Dream&quot;.

Allen twice portrayed the love interest of [[Bobby Ewing]] ([[Patrick Duffy]]), though different characters, on both the final episode of the original run of ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]'' and the first reunion TV movie ''[[Dallas: J.R. Returns]]''.
