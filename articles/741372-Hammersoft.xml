'''Marquette University''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|m|Ér|Ë|k|É|t}}) is a private, coeducational, [[Jesuit]], [[Catholic University|Roman Catholic university]] located in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. Founded by the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1881, the school is one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]]. The university is accredited by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]] and currently has a student body of 11,600. Marquette is one of the largest Jesuit universities in the United States, and the largest private university in [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marquette.edu/omc/newscenter/recent.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1259591106&amp;archive|title=Marquette University Announces Upcoming $84&amp;nbsp;Million Bond Offering|publisher=Marquette University Office of Marketing &amp; Communication|date=November 30, 2009|quote=As Wisconsinâs largest private university, Marquette has more than 11,500 students...|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Pere Marquette.JPG|left|thumb|Father Jacques Marquette exploring]]
Marquette University was founded on August 28, 1881 as Marquette College by [[John Henni|John Martin Henni]], the first Catholic bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee|Archdiocese of Milwaukee]]. The university was named after 17th century missionary and explorer [[Jacques Marquette|Father Jacques Marquette, S.J.]]. The highest priority of the newly established college was to provide an affordable Catholic education to the area's emerging [[Germans|German]] immigrant population. Marquette College officially became a university in 1907. [[Marquette University High School]], formerly the preparatory department of the university, became a separate institution the same year. Initially an all-male institution, Marquette University became the first coed Catholic university in the world, when it admitted its first female students in 1909.

Marquette University acquired the Wisconsin College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1913, and opened schools of medicine (including nursing), dentistry, and pharmacy. Marquette's School of Medicine separated from Marquette in 1967 to become the [[Medical College of Wisconsin]].

The two largest donations to Marquette University came within the same academic year. The second-largest gift was given by an anonymous couple who have, over time, donated over $50&amp;nbsp;million to the university. On December 18, 2006, President [[Rev. Robert A. Wild, S.J.]] announced that the couple donated $25&amp;nbsp;million to the College of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mu.edu/opa/newsroom/news/MarquetteNewsroomEngineeringGift.shtml|title= $25&amp;nbsp;million gift for College of Engineering makes anonymous couple the largest individual benefactors in Marquette history|work=Marquette, Newsroom, Engineering Gift|publisher=Marquette University Office of Marketing &amp; Communication|date=December 18, 2006|accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Marquette University Law School, Eckstein Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Eckstein Hall]], built with the $51 million gift from Raymond and Kathryn Eckstein.]] Less than five months later, on May 4, 2007, Marquette announced a $51&amp;nbsp;million gift from Raymond and Kathryn Eckstein that will directly benefit the Marquette University School of Law. The gift is currently the largest amount ever given to a Wisconsin university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=601030|title=Couple give $51&amp;nbsp;million to Marquette|first=Alan|last=Borsuk|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|publisher=Journal Sentinel, Inc|date=May 4, 2007|quote=...believed to be the largest single gift by individuals to a Wisconsin university or college...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
Marquette is located on a {{convert|93|acre|ha|0|sing=on}} campus in the near downtown Milwaukee neighborhood of [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|University Hill]], on the former Wisconsin State Fairgrounds. [[Lake Michigan]] is roughly one mile east of the edge of campus. The campus encompasses 9th Street on the east, to 20th Street on the west, and from Wells Street on the north, to Clybourn Street on the south. Wisconsin Avenue, a major [[thoroughfare]] in Milwaukee, bisects the campus, placing academic buildings on the south side, and residence halls and other offices and buildings on the north side. Named after the university, the [[Marquette Interchange]] is also close to campus.

=== Major buildings ===
[[File:Gesu Church Milwaukee.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gesu Church]]
* Alumni Memorial Union (AMU, for short), the [[student activity center|student union]], is at the center of campus. The five-story brick building, completed in 1990, contains a ballroom for 800 guests, offices for student organizations, a coffee shop called &quot;Brew Bayou&quot;, the university's information center, a post office, a branch [[US Bank]], a game room, a cafeteria, and the campus gift shop. An adjacent auditorium is connected to the AMU by a covered promenade. Also part of the AMU is the Chapel of the Holy Family, which holds a student Mass each Sunday night.

* [[Gesu Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|Gesu Church]], completed in 1894, is considered the spiritual center of the campus, but is not affiliated with the university. The Jesuit parish was designed by architect [[Henry C. Koch]] in the [[Gothic art]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gesuparish.org/about/architecture.html|title=Church of the Gesu â Architecture|publisher=Church of the Gesu official website|quote=Gesu is pure Gothic in design|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student-organized Masses are held each Sunday in Gesu Church, along with the annual Mass of the Holy Spirit, a traditional celebration at many Jesuit education institutions to begin the school year.

* The [[Patrick and Beatrice Haggerty Museum of Art]] features more than 8,000 works from the old masters to [[contemporary art]] works from such artists as [[Salvador DalÃ­]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Keith Haring]] and [[Roberto Matta]].

* [[Eckstein Hall]], completed in 2010, is the new home of Marquette's [[Marquette University Law School|law school]]. In addition to classrooms and faculty offices, the law school has a four-story &quot;library without borders,&quot; two mock court rooms, a cafeteria, a workout facility, a conference center, and a small parking structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marquette.edu/architect/EcksteinHallProjectOverview.shtml Eckstein Hall Project Overview]. Marquette University. Retrieved on September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sensenbrenner Hall previously housed the [[Marquette University Law School|law school]]. One of the oldest buildings on campus, it is known for its stained-glass windows and traditional design, especially in the Howard B. Eisenberg Memorial Hall. Marquette's law library, which featured contrasting modern architecture, was located next to Sensenbrenner Hall. In 2010, the Law School moved into Eckstein Hall.

[[File:Johnston Hall (Marquette University).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Johnston Hall]]
* Robert A. Johnston Hall houses the J. William &amp; Mary Diederich College of Communications. Built at the turn of the 20th century, the fledgling Marquette College almost went bankrupt to build this until Robert A. Johnston, a local [[confectioner]], donated just over $100,000 to save the project. For a short while, Johnston Hall housed the entire College, including the Jesuit faculty. The now ivy-covered building once featured an [[observatory]] for [[astronomy]] students. [[Marquette University Student Media|Student Media]] is located in Johnston Hall.

[[File:Marquette Hall Milwaukee.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marquette Hall]]
* Marquette Hall, built in 1924, is the four-story building that originally served as Marquette's Science Building with offices, classrooms and labs. In 1976, it was renamed Marquette Hall in honor of the University's namesake. One of the most widely-recognized buildings on campus, Marquette Hall was the home to several offices, including Undergraduate Admissions until they moved to their new location in the newly completed Zilber Hall. The four-story building contains three lecture halls with 300 seats each. In the tower of Marquette Hall is the university carillon, a set of 48 bells that are played every Wednesday and for special events.

* [[Marquette University School of Dentistry|Marquette School of Dentistry]] building houses Wisconsin's only dental school. Completed in 2002, the building holds pre-clinical labs, classrooms, and a community dental clinic.

* The [[Al McGuire Center]], named for the legendary Marquette basketball coach, was opened in 2004 and is home to the women's volleyball and basketball teams and serves as the practice facility and administrative offices for the men's basketball team.

* The John P. Raynor, S.J. Library, completed in 2003, is named for one of Marquette's former presidents. The library contains many of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s original [[manuscript]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marquette.edu/library/collections/archives/tolkien.html J.R.R. Tolkien Collection: Special Collections and Archives]. Marquette University Libraries. Marquette University. Retrieved on September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and serves as one of the main study areas on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marquette.edu/library/ Raynor Memorial Libraries]. Marquette University. Retrieved on September 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[St. Joan of Arc Chapel]] is the only medieval chapel in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/chapel/history/p3.shtml |title=Marquette University &amp;#124; St. Joan of Arc Chapel |publisher=Marquette.edu |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally built in France in the 15th century, the Chapel was donated to the university by Mr. and Mrs. Marc Rojtman in 1964. The building was relocated to the U.S., first to New York, then to Milwaukee, where it was reconstructed piece by piece in 1966. Today, the St. Joan of Arc Chapel hosts daily weekday Masses at noon and 10&amp;nbsp;p.m.

* The Union Sports Annex is a hangout for students, especially during men's basketball season. &quot;The Annex&quot; is almost entirely underground and includes a restaurant, bar, sports court, and bowling lanes. In 2003, [[ESPN]] columnist [[Jim Caple]] called the Union Sports Annex the &quot;best place to watch a game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/slideshow/slideviewer.cgi?list=campus&amp;dir=&amp;config=&amp;refresh=&amp;direction=forward&amp;scale=0&amp;cycle=off&amp;slide=11&amp;design=default&amp;total=25 ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Valley Fields, used for men's and women's soccer, men's and women's track and field, and club athletics, is located across the [[Menomonee River]] in the [[Menomonee River Valley, Milwaukee|Menomonee Valley]], just south of the main campus. It is currently undergoing a renovation to add covered bleachers and other facility improvements.

* Zilber Hall is the Student Services building. It stands on the former site of the 1212 Building and Parent's Park and spans the entire 1200 block of West Wisconsin Avenue. Completed in late fall 2009, Zilber Hall houses the Office of Student Financial Aid, the Office of the Bursar, the Office of the Registrar, and the Office of Admissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/architect/SSbldg_rendering.shtml |title=Zilber Hall â New Student Services Building &amp;#124; Office of the University Architect &amp;#124; Marquette University |publisher=Marquette.edu |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Residence halls ===
Throughout the years, Marquette has absorbed many existing buildings in the area, especially for use as [[residence halls]]. Of the nine current student residence halls, only three (O'Donnell Hall, Schroeder Hall and McCormick Hall) were originally built by the university. Some examples of absorbed buildings include Charles Cobeen Hall, a former hotel, and M. Carpenter Tower, an [[Art Deco]] building, both constructed in the 1920s on 11th Street that have been converted into undergraduate residence halls. Glenn Humphrey Hall, a student apartment complex that was once the [[Childrenâs Hospital of Wisconsin]], and David Straz Tower, which was formerly the Downtown Milwaukee [[YMCA]], and is now a residence hall, recreation center and administrative office building. Mashuda Hall, a sophomore [[dorm]], was once the Coach House Motor Inn where [[The Beatles]] stayed during their tour in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marquette.edu/125/thisweek/sep4-2006.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Abbottsford Hall served as The Abbottsford Hotel until the university purchased it for use as graduate apartments. It was converted into a [[freshman]] residence hall for the 2005â2006 academic year.  The university also purchased the Marquette Apartments complex in 2008, and it was remodeled as a sophomore residence hall, renamed McCabe Hall, for the 2009â2010 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marquette.edu/omc/newscenter/recent.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1237495235&amp;archive=&lt;/ref&gt;

Marquette's intercollegiate athletic teams were the &quot;Warriors&quot; from May 1954 to July 1994 when the nickname was changed to the [[Marquette Golden Eagles|&quot;Golden Eagles&quot;]]. Prior to 1962 Marquette football was known as &quot;Golden Avalanche&quot; and other teams were known as &quot;Warriors,&quot; &quot;Blue and Gold,&quot; and &quot;Hilltoppers&quot;. The Marquette Warriors (the nickname that preceded Golden Eagles) won the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA basketball championship]] in 1977. In 2004, Marquette began to consider changing the name back to Warriors, and conducted a poll that showed 92 percent of alumni and 62 percent of students &quot;identified&quot; with that nickname. However, the [[Board of Trustees]] ignored the results of the poll on the grounds that previous logos had been [[Native American mascot controversy|disrespectful]] to Native Americans, and changed the nickname to simply &quot;Gold&quot;. An intensely negative reaction by students, faculty, alumni, and fans led to yet another series of votes, which eventually pitted &quot;Golden Eagles&quot; against &quot;Hilltoppers&quot;. Respondents were told in advance that write-in votes for &quot;Warriors&quot; would not be tabulated, although those results were later released, and &quot;Golden Eagles&quot; was restored in June 2006.

===Student government===
* Marquette University Student Government (MUSG) serves as the official voice of the student body to university administration, promotes and sponsors campus events, and supports other student organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musg.mu.edu/whoWeAre.php |title=Marquette University Student Government &amp;#124; Who We Are |publisher=Musg.mu.edu |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MUSG was formerly known as the Associated Students of Marquette University (ASMU).

===Performing arts===

* The Studio 013 Refugees:  Marquette's longest running and only improv comedy group.  The Refugees perform anywhere from 8 to 9 free shows throughout the year, including a 12 hour performance outside the AMU in the Fall.  They also provide improv workshops in the fall semester.

* The Marquette University Players Society (MUPS for short), a platform for student-produced theater.

* Dance Groups: Pure Dance and Dance Inc.

* Vocal Groups: The [http://www.marquette.edu/chorus/ Marquette University Chorus]; the longest standing choral organization on campus, is a mixed choir of fifty to sixty men and women who share their time, talents, and passion for music with others at Marquette and throughout the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/osd/music/vocalgroups.shtml |title=Vocal Groups &amp;#124; Music Programs &amp;#124; Office of Student Development &amp;#124; Marquette University &amp;#124; Office of Student Development &amp;#124; Marquette University |publisher=Marquette.edu |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also Men's Choir, Women's Choir, or Chamber Choir. Marquette also has a Gospel Choir, and Liturgical Choir, which sings weekly at mass at Gesu. There are two selective [[a cappella]] groups that interested students may try out for: The Gold 'n Blues (men and women) and The Naturals (an all male group composed of 10 students). Although the a cappella groups are not affiliated with the Marquette University Music Department, the groups do on and off campus concerts.

* The Marquette University Orchestra provides members with an opportunity to develop and share musical talents through participation in a large-group setting.

* Bands: There are four ensembles that students may join. There are two Jazz Bands, meeting at 7 o'clock and 8 o'clock. The [[Symphonic Band]] is a group designed for students who wish to continue to make music at the collegiate level, but in a relaxed setting. There is also the newly established [[Wind Ensemble]], a band which performs high-level wind band repertoire. It is designed for those students who are seeking a high-level music-making experience. All bands are open to all students, and auditions are necessary for chair placement.

* Students who are registered and participate actively in the Symphonic Band and Wind Ensemble have the opportunity to participate in the MU [[Pep Band]]. Although open to all students in band, the pep band splits mainly into two core bands, Blue and Gold, which consist of 29 students each. These core bands are a staple at all Men's and Women's basketball home games, continuing on during tournament season, when the bands travel with the basketball teams.

* All instrumental groups, as well as many choirs, offer 0 or 1 credit per semester. Instruments and lockers, located in the [[Varsity Theater]], are available for rent, free of charge.

===Student media===
{{See also|Marquette University Student Media}}

* In the Spring of 2005, a group of students formed '' The Warrior'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewarrior.org The Warrior'']&lt;/ref&gt; an independent conservative newspaper, named for Marquette's former nickname.

* [[Marquette Radio]] and [[Marquette University Television|MUTV]], the student radio and television stations, were launched in the late-1960s to mid-1970s. MUTV airs student-produced programs, including newscasts, sports shows, and entertainment shows. Marquette Radio also airs student-produced shows with focuses on music, sports, news, and talk.

* A quarterly student produced magazine, the ''[[Marquette Journal]]'', focuses on student life, though formerly the ''Journal'' was the school's student literary magazine. In 2004, the magazine was a runner up for the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] &quot;Mark of Excellence&quot; award for Best Student Magazine Published More than Once a Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spj.org/moe04.asp |title=Society of Professional Journalists: Mark of Excellence Awards |publisher=Spj.org |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Hilltop'' was Marquette's university-wide [[yearbook]] from 1915 to 1999. The publication, in its 84 years of existence, totaled over 30,000 pages in 82 volumes. Students' color-plate sketches were often highly detailed, humorous or dramatic, and appropriate examples of contemporary artwork. In April 2006, Marquette's librarians completed a digitally-archived collection of ''Hilltop''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/library/information/news/2006/Hilltop.html |title=Site Index &amp;#124; Raynor Memorial Libraries &amp;#124; Marquette University |publisher=Marquette.edu |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== School songs ==
The [[school song]]s, &quot;The Marquette University Anthem&quot; and the &quot;Marquette University Fight Song,&quot; are generally sung by students and alumni during basketball games, accompanied by the [[pep band]]. However, the former is often played using the [[carillon]] bells of the Marquette Hall [[bell tower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/alumni/about/musong1.shtml |title=About MUAA &amp;#124; MU Connect &amp;#124; Marquette University |publisher=Marquette.edu |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Marquette University Anthem,&quot; as it was originally known, is now referred to almost exclusively as &quot;Hail Alma Mater.&quot; The tune was written by Liborius Semmann, a music teacher from Wisconsin. The Fight Song is more commonly referred to as &quot;Ring Out Ahoya,&quot; although the actual meaning of the word &quot;Ahoya&quot; is open to a great deal of debate. One leading theory is that the call of &quot;Ahoya&quot; was often made by sailors on the [[Potomac river]] while passing [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., hence Georgetown getting its nickname of &quot;Hoyas.&quot; The cheer was then relayed from priests and professors moving between the two Jesuit universities. The lur horn or long tuba of the modern [[pep band]] sounds a traditional ship's signal during the &quot;Ring Out Ahoya&quot;.
