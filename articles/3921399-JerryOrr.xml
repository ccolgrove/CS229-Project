First known reference to '''art strike''' is in [[Alain Jouffroy]]'s essay &quot;What's To Be Done About Art?&quot; (included in &quot;Art and Confrontation,&quot; New York Graphic Society 1968): 

&quot;It is essential that the minority advocate the necessity of going on an 'active art strike' using the machines of the culture industry to set it in total contradiction to itself. The intention is not to end the rule of production, but to change the most adventurous part of 'artistic' production into the production of revolutionary ideas, forms and techniques.&quot;
