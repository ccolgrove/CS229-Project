==A brief history==
During [[World War II]], [[Philip K. Wrigley]] founded the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball as the [[military draft]] was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players. The league made an auspicious debut, averaging about 1,000 fans per game in 1943, while attracting about 210,000 for the entire year. The circuit excelled in attendance and performing during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fanatics, but by 1954, attendance dropped to only 270,000, when other interests and forms of recreation began to claim the public interest, dooming the league to extinction. It was a neglected chapter of sports history, at least until [[1992 in film|1992]], when [[filmmaker]] [[Penny Marshall]] premiered her film ''[[A League of Their Own]]'', a [[fiction]]alized account of activities in the AAGPBL that brought a rejuvenated interest to the extinct league.&lt;ref name=AAGPBL-History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aagpbl.org/league/history.cfm |title= All-American Girls Professional Baseball League History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104694/ IMDb.com â ''A League of Their Own'' (1992 film)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Wyandotte, Michigan]] in 1927, Romatowski grew up playing sports with her brothers at a very age. She participated in [[golf]] and [[tennis]], but most of the time she played [[softball]], mostly in the streets or in the prairies, until become a member of the Wyandotte's top girls' team. In 1946, she graduated at [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Wyandotte)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in Wyandotte and immediately joined the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball'' â Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland &amp; Company, 2006. Format: Paperback, 438pp. Language: English. ISBN 0786421002&lt;/ref&gt;

==AAGPBL career==
Romatowski moved around for a while, as the AAGPBL shifted players as needed to help new teams stay afloat. She entered the league in 1946 with the [[South Bend Blue Sox]], playing for them one year before joining the [[Rockford Peaches]] (1947). She then found herself on the move again, this time to the [[Chicago Colleens]] (1948), [[Racine Belles]] (1948), [[Peoria Redwings]] (1949) and [[South Bend Blue Sox]] (1950), before settling down with the [[Kalamazoo Lassies]] for the rest of her career (1951â1954). She was used sparingly at [[third base]] and [[outfield]] before converting to [[catcher]].&lt;ref name=AAGPBL-Romatowski/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EWB&quot;&gt;Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball&lt;/ref&gt;

A competent backstop, known more for her defensive skills rather than for her offensive output, Romatowski possessed a strong arm with an extremely quick release of the throw, being appropriately dubbed ''Rifle Arm''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWB&quot;/&gt; 

In 1952, Romatowski was selected for the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League All-Star Team|All-Star Team]] as a replacement for [[Ruth Richard]] (C) and [[Fern Shollenberger]] (3B). The All-Stars, with [[Bill Allington]] at the helm, faced the host South Bend Blue Sox, who were managed by [[Karl Winsch]]. 

For the second consecutive year Romatowski joined the All-Star squad in 1953. Her most productive season came in 1954, when she posted career-highs with a .258 average and six [[home run]]s, and formed part of the Lassies team that won the championship, during what turned out to be the league's final season.&lt;ref name=AAGPBL-History/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EWB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=38 1952 AAGPBL All-Star Team]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=66 1954 AAGPBL All-Star Team]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aagpbl.org/teams.cfm?ID=40 1954 Kalamazoo Lassies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after baseball==
Following her baseball career, Romatowski graduated from [[Eastern Michigan University]] with a degree in [[physical education]], and then she taught physical education for nearly 30 years in the [[Van Dyke Public Schools|Van Dyke-Warren]] school system until her retirement in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPASHOF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polishsportshof.com/inductees/baseball/jenny-romatowski/ |title= National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame â 1999 Inductee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romatowski remained active by playing [[field hockey]]. A natural athlete, she later earned a spot on the United States National team and was chosen to play on an All-Star squad that toured Europe several times in the late 1950s and early 1960s. She even played in the [[Netherlands]] at the World Field Hockey tournament in 1959, and was later active as a coach and administrator, rising to first vice president of the U.S. Field Hockey Association. Her next endeavor was breeding and raising [[greyhound]] dogs for racing, competing for a number of years in [[Florida]] and [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EWB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPASHOF/&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Since 1988 Romatowski is part of ''Women in Baseball'', a permanent display based at the [[Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]], which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities. In 1999 she was selected for membership in the [[National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame]], becoming only the fifth female to be enshrined in the hall. Then, in 2000 she was inducted into the Eastern Michigan University Hall of Fame for her career achievements.&lt;ref name=AAGPBL-History/&gt;&lt;ref name=NPASHOF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emueagles.com/sports/2005/10/27/HallofFame.aspx EMU Hall of Fame Inductees]&lt;/ref&gt; 

&quot;An important part of my involvement in greyhound racing is our [[pet adoption|adoption service]]&quot;, Romatowski explained in an interview. &quot;Once a dogâs racing days are over we help people adopt them... Greyhounds make wonderful house pets&quot;. Despite her varied sports career, she confessed that never did she realize a childhood goal: becoming a [[long track speed skating|long track speed skater]] and competing in the [[Olympic Games]]. She still talks about that, but not much because she has so many fond memories of her athletic and teaching careers.&lt;ref name=NPASHOF/&gt;

A long time resident of [[Palm Harbor, Florida]], Romatowski is active in the [[National Greyhound Association]] and has owned as many as seven dogs at one time.&lt;ref name=NPASHOF/&gt;
