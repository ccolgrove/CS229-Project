The '''tarsi''' (tarsal plates) are two comparatively thick, elongated plates of [[dense connective tissue]], about 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm. in length; one is found in each [[eyelid]], and contributes to its form and support.  They directly abut the lid margins.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;eye, human.&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2008. [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Superior==
The ''superior tarsus'' (tarsus superior; superior tarsal plate), the larger, is of a [[semilunar]] form, about 10&amp;nbsp;mm. in breadth at the center, and gradually narrowing toward its extremities. It is adjoined by the [[Superior tarsal muscle]]

To the anterior surface of this plate the aponeurosis of the [[Levator palpebrÃ¦ superioris]] is attached.

==Inferior==
The ''inferior tarsus'' (tarsus inferior; inferior tarsal plate), is smaller, is thin, elliptical in form, and has a vertical diameter of about 5&amp;nbsp;mm. The free or ciliary margins of these plates are thick and straight.

==Relations==
The attached or orbital margins are connected to the circumference of the orbit by the [[orbital septum]]. 

The lateral angles are attached to the [[zygomatic bone]] by the [[lateral palpebral raphÃ©]]. 

The medial angles of the two plates end at the [[lacrimal lake]], and are attached to the frontal process of the [[maxilla]] by the [[medial palpebral ligament]]).

The [[Meibomian glands]] are aligned vertically within the tarsi: 30 to 40 glands in the upper lid, and 20 to 30 in the lower lid.

[[Sulcus subtarsalis]] is a groove in the innersurface of each eyelid.
