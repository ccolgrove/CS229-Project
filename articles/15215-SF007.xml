'''Windows Internet Explorer''' (formerly '''Microsoft Internet Explorer''', commonly abbreviated '''IE''' or '''MSIE''') is a series of [[graphical user interface|graphical]] [[web browser]]s developed by [[Microsoft]] and included as part of the [[Microsoft Windows]] line of [[operating system]]s, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package [[Microsoft Plus!|Plus! for Windows 95]] that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in [[service pack]]s, and included in the [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.

Internet Explorer has been the most widely used web browser since 1999, attaining a peak of about 95% [[Usage share of web browsers|usage share]] during 2002 and 2003 with [[Internet Explorer 5]] and [[Internet Explorer 6]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Since its peak of popularity, its usage share has been declining in the face of renewed competition from other web browsers, and [[Usage share of web browsers#Summary table|is currently 40.9%]] {{As of|2011|6|lc=on}}. It had been slightly higher, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Usage_share_of_web_browsers&amp;oldid=426989371#Summary_table 43.55%] as of February 2011, just prior to the release of the current version. Microsoft spent over $100 million USD per year on Internet Explorer in the late 1990s,&lt;ref name=&quot;victor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/2009-1032-995681.html?tag=toc|title=Victor: Software empire pays high price &amp;#124; CNET News.com |publisher=News.com|accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 1000 people working on it by 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;ericsink1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericsink.com/Browser_Wars.html|title=Memoirs From the Browser Wars|publisher= Ericsink.com|accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its first release, Microsoft has added features and technologies such as basic [[HTML tables|table]] display (in [[Internet Explorer 1|version 1.5]]); [[XMLHttpRequest]] (in [[Internet Explorer 5|version 5]]), which aids creation of [[dynamic web page]]s; and [[Internationalized Domain Name]]s (in [[Internet Explorer 7|version 7]]), which allow Web sites to have native-language addresses with non-[[Latin alphabet|Latin]] characters. The browser has also received scrutiny throughout its development for use of third-party technology (such as the [[source code]] of [[Spyglass Mosaic]], used without royalty in early versions) and security and privacy [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]], and both [[United States v. Microsoft|the United States]] and [[European Union Microsoft competition case#Related investigations|the European Union]] have alleged that integration of Internet Explorer with Windows has been to the detriment of other browsers.

The latest stable release is [[Internet Explorer 9]], which is available as a free update for [[Windows 7]], [[Windows Vista SP2]], [[Windows Server 2008]], and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]]. Internet Explorer was to be omitted from Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 in Europe, but Microsoft ultimately included it, with a browser option screen allowing users to select any of several web browsers (including Internet Explorer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=? |author= |newspaper=[[Irish Times]] |date= |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/1217/1224260837999.html |accessdate=}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010527045_microsofteu17.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=After years of fighting, Microsoft and EU settle antitrust case without rancor | date=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brussels accepts Microsoft's browser offer |author= |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date= |location= United Kingdom |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ea476aa0-eaac-11de-a9f5-00144feab49a.html |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1948381,00.html | work=Time | title=In E.U.

Versions of Internet Explorer for other operating systems have also been produced, including an embedded OEM version called Pocket Internet Explorer, later rebranded [[Internet Explorer Mobile]], which is currently based on Internet Explorer 9 and made for [[Windows Phone 7]], [[Windows CE]], and previously, based on Internet Explorer 7 for [[Windows Mobile]]. It remains in development alongside the desktop versions. [[Internet Explorer for Mac]] and [[Internet Explorer for UNIX]] ([[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[HP-UX]]) have been discontinued.

===Internet Explorer 1===
{{Main|Internet Explorer 1}}
The first version of Internet Explorer (later referred to as '''Internet Explorer 1''') made its debut on August 16, 1995. It was a reworked version of [[Spyglass Mosaic]], which Microsoft had licensed, like many other companies initiating browser development, from Spyglass Inc.&lt;ref name=&quot;bw&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;win&quot; /&gt; It came with [[Microsoft Plus!]] for [[Windows 95]] and the OEM release of Windows 95, and was installed as part of the ''Internet Jumpstart Kit'' in Plus!.&lt;ref name=&quot;mshistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/community/columns/historyofie.mspx|title=The History of Internet Explorer|publisher=Microsoft|first=Sandi|last=Hardmeier|date=25 August 2005|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet Explorer team began with about six people in early development.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpyglassMosaic&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2009-1032-995681.html|title=Software empire pays high price|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]|work=CNET News|date=15 April 2003|first=John|last=Borland|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer 1.5 was released several months later for [[Windows NT]] and added support for basic table rendering. By including it free of charge on their OS, they did not have to pay royalties to Spyglass Inc., resulting in a lawsuit and a multi-million USD settlement.

===Internet Explorer 2===
{{Main|Internet Explorer 2}}
'''Internet Explorer 2''' was released for Windows 95, [[Windows NT 3.5]], and [[Windows NT 4.0|NT 4.0]] on November 22, 1995 (following a 2.0 beta in October). It featured support for SSL, cookies, [[VRML]], [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], and [[Usenet|Internet newsgroups]]. Version 2 was also the first release for [[Windows 3.1]] and [[Macintosh]] [[System 7|System 7.0.1]] (PPC or 68k), although the Mac version was not released until January 1996 for PPC, and April for 68k.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/comphist/comp1996.htm |title=Computer History |author= |date= |work= |publisher=islandnet.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 2.1 for the Mac came out in August 1996, although by this time, Windows was getting 3.0. Version 2 was included in Windows 95 OSR 1 and Microsoft's ''Internet Starter Kit for Windows 95'' in early 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/apr96/iemompr.mspx |title=Microsoft Internet Explorer Web Browser Available on All Major Platforms, Offers Broadest International Support |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It launched with twelve languages, including English, but by April 1996, this expanded to 24, 20, and 9 for Win 95, Win 3.1, and Mac, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;apr96ms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/apr96/iemompr.mspx  |title=Microsoft Internet Explorer Web Browser Available on All Major Platforms, Offers Broadest International Support |author= |date= |work= |publisher=microsoft.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2.0i version supported double-byte character-set.&lt;ref name=&quot;apr96ms&quot;/&gt;

===Internet Explorer 3===
{{Main|Internet Explorer 3}}
'''Internet Explorer 3''' was released on August 13, 1996, and went on to be much more popular than its predecessors.  Internet Explorer 3 was the first major browser with [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] support, although this support was only partial. It also introduced support for [[ActiveX]] [[ActiveX control|controls]], [[Java applet]]s, inline multimedia, and the [[Platform for Internet Content Selection|PICS]] system for content [[metadata]]. Version 3 also came bundled with [[Internet Mail and News]], [[Microsoft NetMeeting|NetMeeting]], and an early version of the [[Windows Address Book]], and was itself included with Windows 95 OSR 2. Version 3 proved to be the first more popular version of Internet Explorer, bringing with it increased scrutiny. In the months following its release, a number of security and privacy vulnerabilities were found by researchers and hackers. This version of Internet Explorer was the first to have the 'blue e' logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;mshistory&quot; /&gt; The Internet Explorer team consisted of roughly 100 people during the development of three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;victor&quot;/&gt; The first major IE security hole, the Princeton Word Macro Virus Loophole, was discovered on August 22, 1996 in IE3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwnetworks.com/iehistory.htm |title=The History of Microsoft Internet Explorer |publisher=Nwnetworks.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2010}} Backwards compatibility was handled by allowing users who upgraded to IE3 to still use the last IE, because the installation converted the previous version to a separate directory.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;By having IE3 rename your previous version, Microsoft gives you a fallback in case IE3 crashes. IE3 also scans for Netscape bookmarks and converts them to IE3 favorites.&quot; {{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/2801/internet-explorer-30.html |title=Internet Explorer 3.0 |author=Jonathan Chau |date=1996-11-01 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet Explorer 4===
{{Main|Internet Explorer 4}}
'''Internet Explorer 4''', released in September 1997, deepened the level of integration between the web browser and the underlying operating system. Installing version 4 on a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4 machine and choosing ''[[Windows Desktop Update]]'' would result in the traditional Windows Explorer being replaced by a version more akin to a web browser interface, as well as the Windows desktop itself being web-enabled via [[Active Desktop]]. The integration with Windows, however, was subject to numerous packaging criticisms (see [[United States v. Microsoft]]). This option was no longer available with the installers for later versions of Internet Explorer, but was not removed from the system if already installed. Internet Explorer 4 introduced support for [[Group Policy]], allowing companies to configure and lock down many aspects of the browser's configuration as well as support for offline browsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa768170(VS.85).aspx |title=Supporting Offline Browsing in Applications and Components |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Mail and News was replaced with [[Outlook Express]], and [[Microsoft Chat]] and an improved NetMeeting were also included. This version was also included with [[Windows 98]]. New features that allowed users to save and retrieve posts in comment forms were added, but they are not used today. Internet Explorer 4.5 offered new features such as easier 128-bit encryption. It also offered a dramatic stability improvement over prior versions, particularly the [[68k]] version, which was especially prone to freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cws.internet.com/file/11708.htm |title=WinPlanet IE4 Review |author= |date= |work= |publisher=cws.internet.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/broadband/reviews/671/internet-explorer-4.html |title=PC Pro IE4 Review |author= |date= |work= |publisher=pcpro.co.uk |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macuser.co.uk/macuser/reviews/16079/microsoft-internet-explorer-v40.html |title=MacUser IE 4 Review |author=Stroud, Forrest|date= |work= |publisher=macuser.co.uk |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet Explorer 5===
[[Image:Internet Explorer 5 on Windows 98.png|thumb|200px|right|Internet Explorer 5 in [[Windows 98]]]]
{{Main|Internet Explorer 5}}
'''Internet Explorer 5''', launched on March 18, 1999, and subsequently included with [[Windows 98|Windows 98 Second Edition]] and bundled with [[Microsoft Office|Office 2000]], was another significant release that supported [[bi-directional text]], [[ruby character]]s, [[XML]], [[XSLT]], and the ability to save web pages in [[MHTML]] format. IE5 was bundled with [[Outlook Express|Outlook Express 5]]. Also, with the release of Internet Explorer 5.0, Microsoft released the first version of [[XMLHttpRequest]], giving birth to [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] (even though the term &quot;Ajax&quot; was not coined until years later). It was the last with a 16-bit version. Internet Explorer 5.01, a bug fix version included in [[Windows 2000]], was released in December 1999. Internet Explorer 5.5 followed in July 2000, improving its print preview capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with [[Windows Me]].  However, version 5 was the last version for [[Internet Explorer for Mac|Mac]] and [[Internet Explorer for UNIX|UNIX]]. Version 5.5 was the last to have ''Compatibility Mode'', which allowed [[Internet Explorer 4]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/197311/EN-US/ |title=KB197311 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=support.microsoft.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to be run side by side with the 5.x.&lt;ref name=&quot;mshistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/237787 |title=MS Article ID 237787 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=support.microsoft.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IE team consisted of over 1,000 people by 1999, with funding on the order of 100 million [[USD]] per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;victor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ericsink1&quot;/&gt;

===Internet Explorer 6===
[[Image:IE 6 SP3 XP screenshot.PNG|thumb|200px|right|Internet Explorer 6 in [[Windows XP]]]]
{{Main|Internet Explorer 6}}
'''Internet Explorer 6''' was released on August 27, 2001, a few months before [[Windows XP]]. This version included DHTML enhancements, content restricted inline frames, and partial support of CSS level 1, [[Document Object Model|DOM]] level 1, and [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language|SMIL]] 2.0.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axistive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.axistive.com/smil-standards-and-microsoft-internet-explorer-6-7-and-8.html |title = SMIL Standards and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 |accessdate=2007-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[MSXML]] engine was also updated to version 3.0. Other new features included a new version of the [[Internet Explorer Administration Kit]] (IEAK), Media bar, [[Windows Messenger]] integration, fault collection, automatic image resizing, [[P3P]], and a new look-and-feel that was in line with the [[Luna (theme)|''Luna'']] visual style of Windows XP, when used in Windows XP. Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 offered several security enhancements and coincided with the Windows XP SP1 patch release. In 2002, the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] was disabled, and support for it was dropped in Internet Explorer 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;IE_Gopher&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?gopher.floodgap.com/0/gopher/wbgopher |title = Using a web browser to access gopher space |accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer 6.0 SV1&lt;ref name=&quot;sv1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2004/09/02/224902.aspx |title=XPSP2 and its slightly updated user agent string |author= |date=2 September 2004 |work=IEBlog |publisher=MSDN |accessdate=2010-09-26}} SV1 stands for &quot;Security Version 1&quot;, referring to the set of security enhancements made for that release []. This version of Internet Explorer is more popularly known as IE6 SP2, given that it is included with Windows XP Service Pack 2, but this can lead to confusion when discussing Windows Server 2003, which includes the same functionality in the SP1 update to that operating system.&lt;/ref&gt; came out August 6, 2004 for [[Windows XP SP2]] and offered various security enhancements and new color buttons on the user interface.  Internet Explorer 6 updated the original 'blue e' logo to a lighter blue and more [[3D computer graphics|3D]] look.&lt;ref name=&quot;mshistory&quot;/&gt; Microsoft now considers IE6 to be an obsolete product and recommends that users upgrade to Internet Explorer 8. Some corporate IT users have not upgraded despite this, in part because some still use [[Windows 2000]], which will not run Internet Explorer 7 or above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/042610-ie6-corporate-users.html|title=Corporate IT just won't let IE6 die|accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has launched a website, http://ie6countdown.com/, with the goal of getting Internet Explorer 6 usage to drop below 1 percent worldwide. Its current usage is 7.9% percent globally and 1.3% percent in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ie6countdown.com/ |title=The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet Explorer 7===
[[Image:Windows Internet Explorer 7 Vista.png|thumb|200px|right|Internet Explorer 7 in [[Windows Vista]]]]
{{Main|Internet Explorer 7}}
'''Internet Explorer 7''' was released on October 18, 2006. It includes bug fixes, enhancements to its support for web standards, [[Tabbed document interface|tabbed browsing]] with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine search box, a web feeds reader, [[Internationalized Domain Name]] support (IDN), [[Extended Validation Certificate]] support, and an anti-phishing filter. With IE7, Internet Explorer has been decoupled from the Windows Shellâunlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer [[ActiveX control]] is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather runs in a separate Internet Explorer process. It is included with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, and is available for Windows XP Service Pack 2 and later, and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and later. The original release of Internet Explorer 7 required the computer to pass a [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] validation check prior to installing, but on October 5, 2007, [[Microsoft]] removed this requirement. As some statistics show, by mid-2008, Internet Explorer 7 market share exceeded that of Internet Explorer 6 in a number of regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp|title=Browser statistics|publisher=W3Schools|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet Explorer 9''' was released on March 14, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;microsoft.com&quot;&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2011/mar11/03-14IE9RTWPR.mspx | title=Microsoft Announces Global Availability of Internet Explorer 9 | publisher=Microsoft | date=March 14, 2011 | accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development for Internet Explorer 9 began shortly after the release of Internet Explorer 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Forget-about-IE8-Onward-to-Internet-Explorer-9-in-Windows-7-74575.shtml | title=Forget about IE8 - Onward to Internet Explorer 9 in Windows 7 | publisher=SoftNews NET SRL | work=Softpedia | date=December 20, 2007 | accessdate=May 28, 2011 | author=Oiaga, Marcus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft first announced Internet Explorer 9 at [[Professional Developers Conference|PDC 2009]], and spoke mainly about how it takes advantage of hardware acceleration in [[DirectX]] to improve the performance of [[web applications]] and quality of [[web typography]]. At [[MIX (Microsoft)#MIX 10|MIX 10]], Microsoft showed and publicly released the first Platform Preview for Internet Explorer 9, a frame for IE9âs engine not containing any UI of the browser. Leading up to the release of the final browser, Microsoft released updated platform previews, each featuring improved [[JavaScript]] compiling (32-bit version), improved scores on the [[Acid3 test]], as well as additional [[HTML5]] standards support, approximately every 6 weeks. Ultimately, eight platform previews were released. The first public beta was released at a special event in San Francisco, which was themed around &quot;the beauty of the web&quot;. The release candidate was released on February 10, 2011, and featured improved performance, refinements to the UI, and further standards support. The final version was released during the [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) music and film festival in Austin, Texas, on March 14, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;microsoft.com&quot;/&gt;

Internet Explorer 9 is only supported on [[Windows Vista]] SP2, [[Windows 7]], and [[Windows Server 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/system-requirements | title=Internet Explorer 9 system requirements | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports several [[CSS 3]] properties (including border-radius, box-shadow, etc.), embedded [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] v2 or v4 [[ICC profile|color profiles]] support via [[Windows Color System]].

===Internet Explorer 10===
{{Main|Internet Explorer 10}}
Microsoft announced Internet Explorer 10 at [[MIX (Microsoft)#MIX 11|MIX 11]] in Las Vegas, releasing the first Platform Preview at the same time. At the show, it was said that Internet Explorer 10 was about 3 weeks in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/04/12/native-html5-first-ie10-platform-preview-available-for-download.aspx | title=Native HTML5: First IE10 Platform Preview Available for Download | publisher=Microsoft | work=IEBlog | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release further improves upon standards support, including CSS3 gradients.

==Features==
[[File:IE page zoom.png|thumb|[[Page zoom]] as seen in [[IE9]]]]

Internet Explorer has been designed to view a broad range of web pages and provide certain features within the operating system, including [[Microsoft Update]]. During the heyday of the [[browser wars]], Internet Explorer superseded [[Netscape]] only when it caught up technologically to support the progressive features of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/history/netscape.htm |title=Netscape Navigator&amp;nbsp;â Browser History: Netscape explains that by the fourth generations of both browsers, Internet Explorer had caught up technologically with Netscape's browser.... Netscape 6.0 was considered slow and buggy, and adoption was slow to occur |author=Brian wilson |date= |work= |publisher=blooberry.com |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards support===

Internet Explorer, using the [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] [[layout engine]]:
* supports [[HTML]] 4.01, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] Level 1, [[XML]] 1.0, and [[Document Object Model|DOM]] Level 1, with minor implementation gaps.
* fully supports [[XSLT]] 1.0 as well as an obsolete Microsoft dialect of XSLT often referred to as ''WD-xsl'', which was loosely based on the December 1998 W3C Working Draft of [[Extensible Stylesheet Language|XSL]]. Support for [[XSLT 2.0]] lies in the future: semi-official Microsoft bloggers have indicated that development is underway, but no dates have been announced.
*  Almost full conformance to CSS 2.1 has been added in the [[Internet Explorer 8]] release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ie8whitepapers/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=568 | title = Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 Whitepapers | publisher = [[MSDN]] | accessdate = 2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idreamincode.co.uk/ie8-bugs |title=IE8 Bugs |first=James |last=Hopkins |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trident rendering engine in Internet Explorer 9 in 2011 scores highest in the [http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/report/results.html official W3C conformance test suite for CSS 2.1] of all major browsers.
* supports [[XHTML]] in [[Internet Explorer 9]] ([[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] version 5.0). Prior versions can render XHTML documents authored with HTML compatibility principles and served with a &lt;code&gt;text/html&lt;/code&gt; [[MIME|MIME-type]].
* supports a subset&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php | title = Summary results of W3C test suite on multiple browsers, different versions and browser plugins. | accessdate = 2011-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] in [[Internet Explorer 9]] ([[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] version 5.0), excluding SMIL, SVG fonts and filters.

Internet Explorer uses [[Comparison of layout engines (HTML)#DOCTYPE sniffing|DOCTYPE sniffing]] to choose between standards mode and a &quot;[[quirks mode]]&quot; in which it deliberately mimicks nonstandard behaviors of old versions of MSIE for HTML and CSS rendering on screen (Internet Explorer always uses standards mode for printing). It also provides its own dialect of [[ECMAScript]] called [[JScript]].

Internet Explorer had been subjected to criticism by [[W3C]] over its limited support for [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] promoted by [[W3C]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TBLcrit&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Non-standard extensions===

Internet Explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards, including HTML, CSS, and the DOM.  This has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards-compliant web browsers and has introduced the need for a &quot;[[quirks mode]]&quot; to allow for rendering improper elements meant for Internet Explorer in these other browsers.

Internet Explorer has introduced a number of extensions to the DOM that have been adopted by other browsers. These include the innerHTML property, which provides access to the HTML string within an element; the XMLHttpRequest object, which allows the sending of HTTP request and receiving of HTTP response; and the designMode attribute of the contentDocument object, which enables rich text editing of HTML documents. Some of these functionalities were not possible until the introduction of the W3C DOM methods. Its [[Ruby character]] extension to HTML is also accepted as a module in W3C XHTML 1.1, though it is not found in all versions of W3C HTML.

Microsoft submitted several other features of IE for consideration by the W3C for standardization. These include the 'behavior' CSS property, which connects the HTML elements with JScript behaviors (known as HTML Components, HTC); [[HTMLplusTIME|HTML+TIME]] profile, which adds timing and media synchronization support to HTML documents (similar to the W3C [[XHTMLplusSMIL|XHTML+SMIL]]), and the [[VML]] [[vector graphics]] file format. However, all were rejected, at least in their original forms; VML was subsequently combined with [[PGML]] (proposed by [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]), resulting in the W3C-approved [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] format, currently one of the few vector image formats being used on the web, but which IE did not support until version 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php |title=SVG Support Tables  |author= |date= |work= |publisher=codedread.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other non-standard behaviors include: support for vertical text, but in a syntax different from W3C CSS3 candidate recommendation, support for a variety of image effects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webfx.eae.net/tools/filtertool.html |title=Filter Tool (WebFX) |author= |date=2005-05-12 |work= |publisher=webfx.eae.net |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and page transitions, which are not found in W3C CSS, support for [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] script code, in particular &lt;code&gt;JScript.Encode()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cbfz3598(VS.85).aspx |title=Using Script Encoder |author= |date=2005-05-12 |work= |publisher=microsoft.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for [[font embedding|embedding]] [[Embedded OpenType|EOT]] fonts in [[Font embedding on the Web|web pages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/embedding/default.aspx |title=Font Embedding for the Web |author= |date= |work= |publisher=microsoft.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Favicon===
The [[favicon]] (short for &quot;favorites icon&quot;) introduced by Internet Explorer is now also supported and extended in other browsers. It allows web pages to specify a 16-by-16 pixel image for use in bookmarks. In IE, support was, and still is, provided only for the native [[ICO (file format)|Windows ICO format]]; in other browsers it has now been extended to other types of images such as [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]].

===Usability and accessibility===

[[Image:Favorites.PNG|thumb|Organizing [[Favorites]] in [[Internet Explorer 6]]]]
[[Image:IE8 quick tabs.png|thumb|The &quot;quick tabs&quot; feature available in [[Internet Explorer 8]]]]
Internet Explorer makes use of the accessibility framework provided in Windows. Internet Explorer is also a user interface for FTP, with operations similar to that of Windows Explorer. [[Pop-up blocking]] and [[tabbed browsing]] were added respectively in Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 7. Tabbed browsing can also be added to older versions by installing [[MSN Search Toolbar]] or [[Yahoo Toolbar]].

===Cache===
{{Main|Temporary Internet Files|Index.dat}}

Internet Explorer caches visited content in the [[Temporary Internet Files]] folder to allow quicker access (or offline access) to previously visited pages. The content is indexed in a database file, known as [[Index.dat]]. Multiple [[Index.dat]] files exist which index different contentâvisited content, [[web feed]]s, visited [[URL]]s, cookies, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2006/08/04/WinInet_Index_dat.aspx | title = A bit about WinInet's Index.dat | publisher = [[MSDN]] blogs | accessdate = 2008-03-07 | author = Windows Core Networking Team}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to IE7, clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not reliably removed, posing a potential security and privacy risk. In IE7 and later, when the cache is cleared, the cache files are more reliably removed, and the index.dat file is overwritten with null bytes.

Caching has been improved in IE9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/03/17/internet-explorer-9-network-performance-improvements.aspx Internet Explorer 9 Network Performance Improvements]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Group Policy===

{{Main|Group Policy}}
Internet Explorer is fully configurable using [[Group Policy]].  Administrators of [[Windows Server domain]]s (for domain-joined computers) or the local computer can apply and enforce a variety of settings on computers that affect the user interface (such as disabling menu items and individual configuration options), as well as underlying security features such as downloading of files, zone configuration, per-site settings, ActiveX control behavior and others.  Policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine. Internet Explorer also supports [[Integrated Windows Authentication]].

==Architecture==
[[Image:IExplore.svg|thumb|right|225px|The architecture of IE8. Previous versions had a similar architecture, except that both tabs and the UI were within the same process. Consequently, each browser window could have only one &quot;tab process&quot;.]]
Internet Explorer uses a [[software componentry|componentized]] architecture built on the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) technology. It consists of several major components, each of which is contained in a separate [[Dynamic-link library]] (DLL) and exposes a set of COM [[interface (computing)|programming interfaces]] hosted by the Internet Explorer main executable, &lt;tt&gt;iexplore.exe&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa741312.aspx |title = Internet Explorer Architecture | publisher = [[MSDN]] |accessdate = 2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;tt&gt;WinInet.dll&lt;/tt&gt; is the protocol handler for [[HTTP]], [[HTTPS]] and [[FTP]]. It handles all network communication over these protocols.
*&lt;tt&gt;URLMon.dll&lt;/tt&gt; is responsible for [[MIME]]-type handling and download of web content, and provides a thread-safe wrapper around WinInet.dll and other protocol implementations.
*&lt;tt&gt;MSHTML.dll&lt;/tt&gt; houses the [[Trident (rendering engine)|Trident]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]]  introduced in [[Internet Explorer 4]], which is responsible for displaying the pages on-screen and handling the [[Document Object Model]] of the web pages. MSHTML.dll parses the HTML/CSS file and creates the internal [[Document Object Model|DOM]] tree representation of it. It also exposes a set of [[API]]s for runtime inspection and modification of the DOM tree.  The DOM tree is further processed by a layout engine which then renders the internal representation on screen.
*&lt;tt&gt;IEFrame.dll&lt;/tt&gt; contains the user interface and window of IE in Internet Explorer 7 and above.
*&lt;tt&gt;ShDocVw.dll&lt;/tt&gt; provides the navigation, local caching and history functionalities for the browser.
*&lt;tt&gt;BrowseUI.dll&lt;/tt&gt; is responsible for the browser user interface, including the browser chrome, which houses all the menus and toolbars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Chris Wilson | publisher = MSDN Channel9 | accessdate = 2008-03-07 | url = http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=388331 | title = Inside IE8 Beta 1 for Developers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer does not include any native scripting functionality. Rather, &lt;tt&gt;MSHTML.dll&lt;/tt&gt; exposes an API that permit a programmer to develop a scripting environment to be plugged-in and to access the DOM tree. Internet Explorer 8 includes the bindings for the [[Active Scripting]] engine, which is a part of [[Microsoft Windows]] and allows any language implemented as an Active Scripting module to be used for client-side scripting. By default, only the [[JScript]] and [[VBScript]] modules are provided; third party implementations like [[ScreamingMonkey]] (for [[ECMAScript|ECMAScript 4]] support) can also be used. Microsoft also makes available the [[Microsoft Silverlight]] runtime that allows [[CLI languages]], including [[Dynamic Language Runtime|DLR]]-based dynamic languages like [[IronPython]] and [[IronRuby]], to be used for client-side scripting.

[[Internet Explorer 8]] introduces some major architectural changes, called ''Loosely Coupled IE'' (LCIE). LCIE separates the main window process (frame process) from the processes hosting the different web applications in different tabs (tab processes). A frame process can create multiple tab processes, each of which can be of a different [[Mandatory Integrity Control|integrity level]]; each tab process can host multiple web sites. The processes use asynchronous [[Inter-Process Communication]] to synchronize themselves. Generally, there will be a single frame process for all web sites. In [[Windows Vista]] with Protected Mode turned on, however, opening privileged content (such as local HTML pages) will create a new tab process as it will not be constrained by Protected Mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/03/11/ie8-and-loosely-coupled-ie-lcie.aspx | title = IE8 and Loosely Coupled IE | accessdate = 2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extensibility==
{{See also|Component Object Model|Browser Helper Object}}

Internet Explorer exposes a set of [[Component Object Model]] (COM) interfaces that allow other components to extend the functionality of the browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;/&gt; Extensibility is divided into two types: Browser extensibility and Content extensibility. The browser extensibility interfaces can be used to plug in components to add context menu entries, toolbars, menu items or [[Browser Helper Objects]] (BHO). BHOs are used to extend the feature set of the browser, whereas the other extensibility options are used to expose the feature in the UI. Content extensibility interfaces are used by different content-type handlers to add support for non-native content formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;/&gt; BHOs not only have unrestricted access to the Internet Explorer [[Document Object Model|DOM]] and event model, they also can access the filesystem, registry and other OS components. Content extensibility can be either in terms of ''Active Documents'' (''Doc Objects'') (e.g., [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] or [[MathML]]) or ''[[ActiveX]] controls''.&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;/&gt; ActiveX controls are used for content handlers that render content embedded within an HTML page (e.g., [[Adobe Flash]] or [[Microsoft Silverlight]]). Doc objects are used when the content type will not be embedded in HTML (e.g., [[Microsoft Word]], [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] or [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]]). In fact, the Trident rendering engine is itself exposed as a Doc object, so HTML in itself is treated as an Active Document.&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Am addon manager.png|right|thumb|Add-on Manager from Windows XP SP2 Internet Explorer 6 SV1]]

Internet Explorer add-on components run with the same privileges as the browser itself, unlike client-side scripts that have a very limited set of privileges. Add-ons can be installed either locally, or directly by a web site. Since the add-ons have a more privileged access to the system, malicious add-ons can and have been used to compromise the security of the system. Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 2 onwards provide various safeguards against this, including an [[Plug-in (computing)|Add-on]] Manager for controlling ActiveX controls and Browser Helper Objects and a &quot;No Add-Ons&quot; mode of operation as well as greater restrictions on sites installing add-ons.

Internet Explorer 9 introduced a new component&amp;nbsp;â Add-on Performance Advisor. Add-on Performance Advisor shows a notification when one or more of installed add-ons exceed a pre-set performance threshold. The notification appears in the Notification Bar when the user launches the browser.

Internet Explorer itself can be hosted by other applications via a set of COM interfaces. This can be used to embed the browser functionality inside the application. Also, the hosting application can choose to host only the MSHTML.dll rendering engine, rather than the entire browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;architecture&quot;/&gt;

==Security==
Internet Explorer uses a zone-based [[computer security|security]] framework that groups sites based on certain conditions, including whether it is an Internet- or intranet-based site as well as a user-editable whitelist. Security restrictions are applied per zone; all the sites in a zone are subject to the restrictions.

Internet Explorer 6 SP2 onwards uses the ''Attachment Execution Service'' of [[Microsoft Windows]] to mark executable files downloaded from the Internet as being potentially unsafe. Accessing files marked as such will prompt the user to make an explicit trust decision to execute the file, as executables originating from the Internet can be potentially unsafe. This helps in preventing accidental installation of malware.

Internet Explorer 7 introduced the phishing filter, that restricts access to [[phishing]] sites unless the user overrides the decision. With version 8, it also blocks access to sites known to host [[malware]]. Downloads are also checked to see if they are known to be malware-infected.

In [[Windows Vista]], Internet Explorer by default runs in what is called ''Protected Mode'', where the privileges of the browser itself are severely restrictedâit cannot make any system-wide changes. One can optionally turn this mode off but this is not recommended. This also effectively restricts the privileges of any add-ons. As a result, even if the browser or any add-on is compromised, the damage the security breach can cause is limited.

Patches and updates to the browser are released periodically and made available through the Windows Update service, as well as through [[Automatic Updates]]. Although security patches continue to be released for a range of platforms, most feature additions and security infrastructure improvements are only made available on operating systems which are in Microsoft's mainstream support phase.

On December 16, 2008, [[Trend Micro]] recommended users switch to rival browsers until an emergency IE patch was released to fix a potential security risk which &quot;could allow outside users to take control of a person's computer and steal their passwords&quot;. Microsoft representatives countered this recommendation, claiming that &quot;0.02% of internet sites&quot; were affected by the flaw.

On December 17, 2008, a fix to the security problem above became available, with the release of the Security Update for Internet Explorer KB960714, which is available from Microsoft Windows Update's webpage. Microsoft has said that this update fixes the security risk found by Trend Micro the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/world/north-america/security-risk-detected-in-internet-explorer-software-14110209.html |title=Security risk detected in Internet Explorer software |date=2008-12-16 |newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm |newspaper=BBC News | title=Serious security flaw found in IE | date=2008-12-16 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security vulnerabilities===
{{See also|Comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities}}
Internet Explorer has been subjected to many security vulnerabilities and concerns:&lt;!-- Now, in one sentence, we answer how the security issues, enumerated and detailed ELSEWHERE, affect people such that the volume of criticism for IE is unusually high --&gt; Much of the [[spyware]], [[adware]], and [[computer virus]]es across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a &quot;[[drive-by download|drive-by install]]&quot;. There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an [[ActiveX]] security alert.

A number of security flaws affecting IE originated not in the browser itself, but [[ActiveX]]-based add-ons used by it. Because the add-ons have the same privilege as IE, the flaws can be as critical as browser flaws. This has led to the ActiveX-based architecture being criticized for being fault-prone. By 2005, some experts maintained that the dangers of ActiveX have been overstated and there were safeguards in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security features introduced in then recently released Internet Explorer 7 mitigated some of these vulnerabilities.

Internet Explorer in 2008 had a number of published security vulnerabilities.   According to research done by security research firm [[Secunia]], Microsoft did not respond as quickly as its competitors in fixing security holes and making patches available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://secunia.com/gfx/Secunia2008Report.pdf
|title=Secunia 2008 Report
|publisher=Secunia
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm also reported 366 vulnerabilities in ActiveX controls, an increase from the prior year.

According to the latest information, Secunia reports that IE6 has 24 known unpatched vulnerabilities, IE7 has 11, and IE8 has 4. The most severe unpatched Secunia advisories affecting Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x with all vendor patches applied, are all rated Extremely critical. The oldest known unpatched vulnerabilities for IE6, IE7, and IE8 date from November 7, 2003, June 6, 2006, and February 26, 2007 respectively.

According to the latest information, security research firm [[SecurityFocus]] reports that IE6 has 396 known unpatched vulnerabilities, IE7 has 22, and IE8 has 25. The oldest known unpatched vulnerabilities for IE6, IE7, and IE8 date from November 20, 2000, May 17, 2007, and April 11, 2009 respectively.

According to an October 2010 report in The Register, researcher Chris Evans had detected a known security vulnerability which, then dating back to 2008, had not been fixed for at least 600 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Vulnerability exploited in attacks on U.S. firms===
{{Main|Operation Aurora}}
In an advisory on January 14, 2010, Microsoft said that attackers targeting Google and other U.S. companies used software that exploits a security hole, which had already been patched, in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability affected Internet Explorer 6, IE7, and IE8 on Windows 7, Vista, Windows XP, Server 2003, and Server 2008 R2, as well as IE 6 Service Pack 1 on Windows 2000 Service Pack 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New IE hole exploited in attacks on U.S. firms |author=Elinor Mills |newspaper=news.cnet.com |date=2010-01-14 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-10435232-245.html |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germany|German]] government warned users against using Internet Explorer and recommended switching to an alternative web browser, due to the major security hole described above that was [[Operation Aurora#Attack analysis|exploited in Internet Explorer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8463516.stm | work=BBC News | title=Germany issues Explorer warning | date=2010-01-16 | accessdate=2010-03-26 | first=Daniel | last=Emery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian and French Government issued a similar warning a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8465038.stm | work=BBC News | title=France in fresh Explorer warning | date=2010-01-18 | accessdate=2010-03-26 | first=Jonathan | last=Fildes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/19/2795684.htm |title=Govt issues IE security warning |author=Emily Bourke for AM |date=2010-01-19 |work= |publisher=abc.net.au |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first browser they recommended was Mozilla Firefox, followed by Google Chrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/techchron/detail?&amp;entry_id=55509 | title=The Technology Chronicles : France and Germany warn users not to use Internet Explorer | first=Alejandro | last=Martinez-Cabrera | date=2010-01-18 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/microsoft/7011626/Germany-warns-against-using-Microsoft-Internet-Explorer.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Germany warns against using Microsoft Internet Explorer | first=Fiona | last=Govan | date=2010-01-18 | accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market adoption and usage share==
{{Browser marketshare|align=right}}
{{See also|Usage share of web browsers}}
The adoption rate of Internet Explorer seems to be closely related to that of Microsoft Windows, as it is the default web browser that comes with Windows. Since the integration of Internet Explorer 2.0 with Windows 95 OSR 1 in 1996, and especially after version 4.0's release, the adoption was greatly accelerated: from below 20% in 1996 to about 40% in 1998 and over 80% in 2000.

A CNN article noted at the release of [[Internet Explorer 4]]: &quot;Microsoft's Internet Explorer has made inroads and various estimates put its share of the browser market 30 to 35 percent from about 10 percent a year ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A CNN article noted at the release of [[Internet Explorer 4]],'' &quot;Microsoft's Internet Explorer has made inroads and various estimates put its share of the browser market 30 to 35 percent from about 10 percent a year ago&quot;.  {{cite news |title=It's out: Microsoft unveils Internet Explorer 4.0 - |author= |newspaper=CNN |date=1997-09-30 |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/9709/30/ms.explorer/ |accessdate=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002, Internet Explorer had almost completely superseded its main rival [[Netscape]] and dominated the market with up to 95 percent market share.

After having fought and won the [[browser wars]] of the late 1990s, Internet Explorer gained almost total dominance of the browser market. Having attained a peak of about 95% during 2002 and 2003, its market share has since declined at a slow but steady pace. This is mainly due to the adoption of [[Mozilla Firefox]], which statistics indicate is currently the most significant competition. Nevertheless, Internet Explorer remains the dominant web browser, with a global usage share of around 60% (though measurements vary). Usage is higher in Asia and lower in Europe.

Firefox 1.0 had surpassed [[Internet Explorer 5]] in early 2005 with Firefox 1.0 at roughly 8 percent market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=40&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=74 |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |work= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An article notes at the release of [[Internet Explorer 7]] in October 2006 that &quot;IE6 had the lion's share of the browser market with 77.22%. Internet Explorer 7 had climbed to 3.18%, while Firefox 2.0 was at 0.69%.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/IE7-and-Firefox-2-0-Are-Slaughtering-Internet-Explorer-6-77994.shtml |title=IE7 and Firefox 2.0 Are Slaughtering Internet Explorer 6 - Out with the old, in with the new
 |author=Marius Nestor, Linux Editor |date= |work= |publisher=softpedia.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Internet Explorer retained dominance over the desktop computing web browser share, with 52.63% of the desktop market. IE lost its majority in the overall internet market, now having 49.6% of the market. This is due to the growth of mobile internet use. Safari has 62.17% of that market. The mobile market makes up 6% of all web traffic.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Zoe. &quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/03/tech/web/internet-explorer-traffic-share-mashable/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 Internet Explorer's share of web traffic drops below 50%].&quot; ''[[Mashable]]'' at ''[[CNN]]''.

Internet Explorer 7 was released at the same time as [[Mozilla Firefox 2|Firefox 2.0]], and overtook Firefox 1.x by  November 2006, at roughly 9% market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=40&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=94 |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |work= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firefox 2.0 had overtaken 1.x by January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=40&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=95 |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |work= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but IE7 did not surpass [[Internet Explorer 6|IE6]] until December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=40&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=107 |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |work= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2008, their respective  version market share stood at 43% IE7, 32% IE6, 16% FF2, 4% [[Safari (web browser)|Safari 3]] and both FF1.x and IE5 versions at less than half a percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2&amp;qpmr=40&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=108  |title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines |author= |date= |work= |publisher=marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry adoption===
The [[ActiveX]] extension mechanism is used by many public websites and [[web application]]s, including [[eBay]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Similarly, [[Browser Helper Object]]s are also used by many [[Web search engine|search engine]] companies and third parties for creating add-ons that access their services, such as search engine toolbars. Because of the use of COM, it is possible to embed web-browsing functionality in third-party applications. Hence, there are a number of [[Internet Explorer shell]]s, and a number of content-centric applications like [[RealPlayer]] also use Internet Explorer's web browsing module for viewing web pages within the applications.

==OS compatibility==
IE versions, over time, have had widely varying OS compatibility, ranging from being available for many platforms and several versions of Windows to only a few versions of Windows. Many versions of IE had some support for an older OS but stopped getting updates. The increased growth of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s means that current browsers with small market shares have more total users than the entire market early on. For example, 90% market share in 1997 would be roughly 60 million&lt;ref name=&quot;internetworldstats1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = History and Growth of the Internet | url = http://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm | accessdate = 2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; users, but by the start of 2007 90% market share would equate to over 900 million users.&lt;ref name=&quot;internetworldstats1&quot;/&gt; The result is that later versions of IE6 had many more users in total than all the early versions put together.

The release of IE7 at the end of 2006 resulted in a collapse of IE6 market share; by February 2007, market version share statistics showed IE6 at about 50% and IE7 at 29%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=6&amp;qpmr=55&amp;qpdt=1&amp;qpct=3&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=97 | title = Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines| accessdate= 2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the actual market share, the most compatible version (across operating systems) of IE was 5.x, which had Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, Unix, and most Windows versions available and supported for a short period in the late 1990s (although 4.x had a more unified codebase across versions). By 2007, IE had much narrower OS support, with the latest versions supporting only Windows XP Service Pack 2 and above.  Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0 (Experimental) have also been unofficially ported to the [[Linux]] operating system from the project [[IEs4Linux]].

==&quot;Standalone&quot; Internet Explorer==
While Microsoft claims it is impossible to keep multiple versions of Internet Explorer on the same machine, some [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]]s have successfully separated several versions of Internet Explorer, making them standalone applications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A web developer, [[Joe Maddalone]], is credited with finding a solution ([http://labs.insert-title.com/Multiple-IEs-in-Windows_article795.aspx Multiple IEs in Windows Web Design]). These are referred to as &quot;standalone&quot; IEs{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and go as far back as Internet Explorer version 3.

===Standalone installers===
Microsoft has discontinued standalone installers for Internet Explorer to the general public. However, there are unofficial procedures for downloading the complete install package. Internet Explorer standalone uses a feature introduced in Windows 2000 called [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682600.aspx DLL redirection] to force it to load older DLLs than the ones installed on the system.
*[http://finalbuilds.edskes.net/iecollection.htm IE Collection]. An installer for the standalone versions of IE8.0, IE7.0, IE6.0, IE5.51, IE5.01, IE4.01, IE3.0, IE2.01, IE1.5, and IE1.0.
*Microsoft [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/257249/EN-US Support] document, with instructions for downloading the entire set of installation files.

[[Image:IE6ubuntu.png|thumb|right|Internet Explorer 6 running on [[Linux]] in [[Wine (software)|Wine]].]]

===Alternative environments===
It is also possible to install Internet Explorer in [[Wine (software)|Wine]] (a [[compatibility layer]]):
*[[IEs4Linux]] automatically sets up Internet Explorer 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0 in Wine. Support for Internet Explorer 7 development was started August 2007, and stalled with the last package being available in 2008. That package used an IE7 rendering engine with the IE6 user interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Beta |title=Beta&amp;nbsp;â IEs4Linux |publisher=Tatanka.com.br |date= |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a blog post on January 5, 2011 announcing that the developers are working to support [[Internet Explorer 9|IE9]] and will soon release a new version after almost 3 years of inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/news/55 | title=Supporting IE9 on Linux | publisher=Tatanka.com.br | work=IEs 4 Linux | date=January 5, 2011 | accessdate=May 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[IETester]] is a side-by-side compatibility checker for different versions of Internet Explorer.  As of 2011, it is [http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage available from DebugBar] as an alpha release.  Its highest tester rating from the [http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;iId=7039 WineHQ profile] has been Bronze.

As an alternative to using IE standalone, Microsoft now makes available [[Windows Virtual PC]] images containing copies of [[Microsoft Windows]] with IE installed:&lt;ref name=&quot;VPCIEImages&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=21EABB90-958F-4B64-B5F1-73D0A413C8EF&amp;displaylang=en |title=Internet Explorer Application Compatibility VPC Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Windows XP SP3 with IE6 (with installers for IE7 and IE8)
* Windows Vista SP2 with IE7 (with installers for IE7 and IE8)
* Windows 7 SP1 with IE8 (with install files for IE9)
* Windows 7 IE9 + Tools Image

According to Microsoft's site, such images shutdown and become completely unusable on August 9, 2011.

Microsoft recommends this approach for web developers seeking to test their pages in the different versions of IE as the standalone versions are unsupported and may not work the same way as a properly installed copy of IE.&lt;ref name=&quot;MultipleIE1&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/11/30/ie6-and-ie7-running-on-a-single-machine.aspx |title=IE6 and IE7 Running on a Single Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MultipleIE2&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/cwilso/archive/2006/02/01/522281.aspx |title=Multiple IEs on one machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Versioning===
Despite the official stance that only one version of Internet Explorer can be installed on the same machine, there are notable exceptions.

Early versions of Internet Explorer such as 5 had a compatibility mode to run Internet Explorer 4, though this feature was dropped (also, Internet Explorer for Mac users could still use 4.5 after installing IE 5{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}).  Internet Explorer 8 brought back the concept of a compatibility mode, but users cannot actually run the earlier versions of Internet Explorer.

Internet Explorer 7 contains traces of Internet Explorer 6 code.  After Internet Explorer 7 is installed, an Internet Explorer 6 executable is still available in C:\WINDOWS\ie7, hidden by default. Launching this executable provides the user with the older IE6 interface, however web pages are rendered using the IE7 engine. The IE6 engine can be re-enabled by placing a file named &quot;iexplore.exe.local&quot; into the IE7 folder.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Removal==
{{Main|Removal of Internet Explorer}}
While a major upgrade of Internet Explorer can be uninstalled in a traditional way if the user has saved the original application files for installation, the matter of uninstalling the version of the browser that has shipped with an operating system remains a controversial one.

The idea of removing a stock install of Internet Explorer from a Windows system was proposed during the [[United States v. Microsoft]] case. One of Microsoft's arguments during the trial was that removing Internet Explorer from Windows may result in system instability.

Removing Internet Explorer does have a number of consequences. Applications that depend on libraries installed by IE will fail to function correctly. The Windows help and support system will also not function due to the heavy reliance on [[HTML help]] files and components of IE. In versions of Windows before [[Windows Vista|Vista]], it is also not possible to run Microsoft's [[Windows Update]] or [[Microsoft Update]] with any other browser due to the service's implementation of an [[ActiveX]] control, which no other browser supports. In Windows Vista, [[Windows Update]] is implemented as a [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] applet.

With Windows 7, Microsoft added the ability to safely remove Internet Explorer 8 from Windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Internet Explorer 8 can be removed from Windows 7&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://winjade.net/2009/03/ie8-functionally-removable/ |title=Internet Explorer 8 can be removed from Windows 7 |date=2009-03-03 |publisher=[[AeroXperience]] |first=Bryant |last=Zadegan |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet Explorer executable (iexplore.exe) is removed without harming any other Windows components.
