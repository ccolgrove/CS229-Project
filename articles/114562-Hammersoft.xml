'''Kingston, Ontario''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] city located in [[Eastern Ontario]] where the [[St. Lawrence River]] flows out of [[Lake Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofkingston.ca/about.asp |title=About The City of Kingston |publisher=Cityofkingston.ca |date=2010-02-09 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a [[First Nations]] settlement called &quot;Katarowki,&quot; (Ga-ta-row-key), growing European exploration in the 17th Century made it an important trading post. In order to control the [[fur trade]], [[French people|French]] explorer [[RenÃ©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|LaSalle]] founded [[Fort Frontenac]] in 1673.

Located midway between [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], Kingston was named the first capital of the [[Act of Union 1840|Province of Canada]] on February 15, 1841, by Governor [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham|Lord Sydenham]].&lt;ref&gt;City of Kingston [http://www.cityofkingston.ca/firstcapital/overview.asp City Hall: Canada's Would-Be First Parliament].&lt;/ref&gt; While its time as a political centre was short, Kingston remained an important military installation.

Kingston is the county seat of [[Frontenac County, Ontario|Frontenac County]]. According to the
[[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Canadian census]], the population of the city proper was 117,207,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=3510010&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=35&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Kingston&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom= |title=Statistics Canada 2006 Census for Kingston |publisher=2.statcan.ca |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the population of the metropolitan area was 152,358.

Kingston is nicknamed the ''&quot;Limestone City&quot;'' because of the many historic buildings built from the local [[limestone]].

==History==
===Origins, settlement, and growth===
The [[France|French]] originally settled upon a traditional [[Mississaugas]] [[First Nation]] site called ''Katarokwi'' (Cataraqui in the common transliteration, and according to French pronunciation rules should be said &quot;kah-tah-RAH-kee,&quot; although it is generally pronounced &quot;kah-tah-ROCK-way&quot;) in 1673 and established Fort Cataraqui, later to be called [[Fort Frontenac]]. The fort was captured and destroyed by the [[Great Britain|British]] in the [[Battle of Fort Frontenac]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1758. A receiving centre for fleeing refugees from the [[American Revolution]] some years later, Kingston became the primary community of southeastern [[Upper Canada]].

[[United Empire Loyalists]] formed a significant part of an expanding population in the area at the end of the 18th century. Loyalists who had originally sought refuge at [[Carleton Island]] during the Revolutionary War arrived at Cataraqui after the area was surveyed in 1783. One of these Loyalists was [[Molly Brant]] (the sister of Six Nations Leader [[Joseph Brant]]). A large group of Loyalists led by Captain Michael Grass arrived in 1784, having sailed from [[New York City|New York]] and up the St. Lawrence River. Fort Frontenac was restored to accommodate a military garrison that would defend the new community.

Cataraqui was referred to as &quot;''the King's Town''&quot; or &quot;''King's Town''&quot; by 1787 in honour of [[King George III]].&lt;ref name=armstrong67&gt;Armstrong 1973, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca/chrono.html|title=Chronology of the History of Kingston|publisher=Kingston Historical Society|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was shortened to &quot;''Kingston''&quot; in 1788.&lt;ref name=armstrong67/&gt;

During the [[War of 1812]], Kingston was the base for the Lake Ontario division of the [[Great Lakes]] [[Royal Navy|British naval fleet]] which engaged in a vigorous [[arms race]] with the American fleet based at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York|Sackett's Harbor]], New York for control of Lake Ontario. After the war, Britain built [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] and a series of distinctive [[Martello tower]]s to guard the entrance to the [[Rideau Canal]]. All still exist, and Fort Henry is a popular tourist attraction. 

Kingston's location at the Rideau Canal entrance to Lake Ontario, after canal construction was completed in 1832, made it the primary military and economic centre of Upper Canada. Incorporated as a town in 1838, the first [[List of mayors of Kingston, Ontario|mayor of Kingston]] was [[Thomas Kirkpatrick]]. Kingston had the largest population of any centre in [[Upper Canada]] until the 1840s. Kingston was incorporated as a city in 1846.

Kingston was chosen as the first capital of the united [[Province of Canada|Canadas]] and served in that role from 1841 to 1844. The first meeting of the Parliament of the United Canadas on June 13, 1841, was held on the site of what is now [[Kingston General Hospital]]. The city was considered too small and lacking in amenities, however, and its location made it vulnerable to American attack. Consequently, the capital was moved to alternating locations in Montreal and Toronto, and then later to [[Ottawa]] in 1857. Subsequently, Kingston's growth slowed considerably and its national importance declined.

Kingston was the home of Canada's first [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], [[Sir John A. Macdonald]]. One of his residences in Kingston, [[Bellevue House]], is now a popular [[National Historic Site of Canada]] open to the public and depicting the house as it would have been in the 1840s when he lived there.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Kingston remained an important Great Lakes port and a centre for [[shipbuilding]] and [[locomotive]] manufacturing, including the [[Canadian Locomotive Company]], at one time the largest locomotive works in the [[British Empire]]. Most heavy industry has now left the city, and employment is now primarily in the institutional, military, and service/retail sectors.

Kingston grew moderately through the 20th century through a series of annexations of lands in adjacent Kingston Township, including a 1952 annexation of some {{convert|5500|acre|km2}} which encompassed areas west to the [[Little Cataraqui Creek]] (including the village of Portsmouth), where a number of large residential subdivisions were built in the late 1950s and early '60s.

Municipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding townships, which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the City was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh Township]] to form a new City of Kingston. The city's boundaries now encompass large rural areas north of Highway 401 and east of the Cataraqui River.

The term &quot;Cataraqui&quot;, from the original native name for Kingston, today refers to an area around the intersection of [[Princess Street (Kingston)|Princess Street]] and Sydenham Road where a village that later took the name was located. Cataraqui is also the name of a municipal electoral district.

===Military history===
Kingston, being strategically located at the head of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River near the border with the [[United States]], has been a site of military importance since Fort Frontenac was built in 1673. The French, and later, the British established military garrisons. Several defensive fortifications were constructed in the 19th century, including Fort Henry, four martello towers, and the Market [[Battery (artillery)|Battery]]. Military ships were built at the [[Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard]] at Point Frederick from 1788 to 1853.

After the British army withdrew from most locations in Canada in 1870-71, two batteries of garrison artillery were formed by the Dominion Government - one in Kingston; the other in [[Quebec City]].  The batteries were also schools of gunnery. The Kingston battery was garrisoned at Fort Henry and TÃªte du Pont Barracks (Fort Frontenac). Designated as the ''Regiment of Canadian Artillery'', the regular component evolved into the [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]], with most of its battery housed at TÃªte du Pont Barracks until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryheritage.com/rcha.htm The Victorian Solder - History and Uniform of the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, 1871 to 1970] Retrieved 2011-09-10&lt;/ref&gt;

The withdrawal of imperial troops required a Canadian location for the training of military officers. Because of Kingston's military tradition and the fact that several military buildings already existed at the old naval dockyard, Point Frederick was chosen as the location for Canada's first military college, the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] (RMC). The college opened in 1876.

Located east of Kingston's downtown, the army's Camp Barriefield, now McNaughton Barracks, was constructed at the beginning of the [[First World War]] and expanded during the [[Second World War]]. Camp Barriefield was named in honour of Rear-Admiral Sir [[Robert Barrie]] (May 5, 1774 â June 7, 1841), a British naval officer noted for his service in the War of 1812. It was later named McNaughton Barracks after [[Andrew George Latta McNaughton]], a former minister of national defence. Nearby Vimy Barracks was established in 1937 for the [[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals]] (later the Royal Canadian School of Signals). Vimy and McNaughton Barracks house the Canadian Forces School of Communications and Electronics (CFSCE), the [[Canadian Forces]]' military communications training centre and several other units. McNaughton Barracks and Vimy Barracks make up most of Canadian Forces Base Kingston ([[CFB Kingston]]). Major military facilities supported by CFB Kingston include Fort Frontenac, located on the site of the original fort, and the Royal Military College of Canada.  

A military aerodrome, [[RCAF Station Kingston]], was constructed to the west of Kingston to support flying training during the Second World War.

===Built heritage===
Kingston is known for its historic properties, as reflected in the city's motto of &quot;where history and innovation thrive&quot;.  The municipality has nearly 700 properties listed in the heritage register it maintains pursuant to the [[Ontario Heritage Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage|url=http://www.cityofkingston.ca/residents/culture/heritage/|work=Official site|publisher=City of Kingston|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Rideau Canal, along with the fortifications at Kingston, was designated a [[World Heritage Site]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rideau Canal|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1221|work=World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of only 15 such sites in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ca|work=World Heritage Centre|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 20 [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Kingston, Ontario|National Historic Sites of Canada]] located in Kingston.  Kingston has the third largest number of National Historic Sites within its boundaries of any city in Ontario, after [[Ottawa]] and [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/page3_E.asp?locateinp=Kingston&amp;nhsprov=Ontario&amp;nhschoice=nhsdesig&amp;list4=Generate+List Kingston], Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Kingston's economy relies heavily on public sector institutions and establishments. The most important sectors are related to [[health care]], education ([[Queen's University]], the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], and [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]]), government (including the [[military]] and correctional services), [[tourism]] and [[culture]]. [[Manufacturing]], and [[research and development]] play a smaller role than in the past. One of Kingston's major industrial employers of the 20th century, the [[Canadian Locomotive Company]], closed in 1969, and the former [[Alcan]] and [[DuPont]] operations employ far fewer people than in the past.

According to the Kingston Economic Development Corporation, the 24 largest employers in Kingston as of May 2009 were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.kingstoncanada.com/en/communityprofile/employers.asp Kingston Major Employers] Retrieved: 2010-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
[[File:Tourism Kingston Logo.jpg|thumb|left|The logo of ''Tourism Kingston'']]
According to [[Statistics Canada]], The [[tourism]] industry in Kingston represents a vital part of the city's economy. In 2004, over 3,500 jobs were contributed to Kingston's economy due to the tourism industry. The tourism industry has been at a healthy growth rate and has become one of the most performing sectors of Kingston. Unique opportunities are presented for this industry in this time of shifting travel trends and the baby boomer generation. The success of Kingston's tourism industry is heavily dependent on information about travelers, however data availability still remains a challenge.&lt;ref name=kingstoncanada&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritsche|first=Alexander|title=Kingstonâs Tourism Industry|url=http://www.kingstoncanada.com/en/makeaconnection/resources/Reports-TourismIndustry_AlexFritsche.pdf|work=May 21, 2008|publisher=KingstonCanada.com|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingston hosts several festivals during the year, including the Limestone City Blues Festival, the Kingston Canadian Film Festival, Fanfayr, the Kingston Buskers' Rendezvous, Kingston Jazz Festival, Reelout Film Festival, Feb Fest and the Wolfe Island Music Festival.

Kingston is home to many artists who work in visual arts, media arts, literature, and a growing number who work in other time-based disciplines such as performance art. The contemporary arts scene in particular has two long standing professional non-profit venues in the downtown area, the [[Agnes Etherington Art Centre]] (founded 1957), and Modern Fuel Artist-Run Centre (founded 1977). Local artists often participate in the exhibition programming of each organization, while each also presents the work of artists from across Canada and around the world - inkeeping with their educational mandates. Alternative venues for the presentation of exhibition programs in Kingston include The Union Gallery (Queen's University's student art gallery), Verb Gallery, Open Studio 22, the Kingston Arts Council gallery, and The Artel: Arts Accommodations and Venue.

The [http://www.kingstonwritersfest.ca Kingston WritersFest] occurs annually. Literary events also happen throughout the year at the [[Kingston Frontenac Public Library]] and local bookstores.

Comedian and actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] has a residence just north of Kingston and is a frequent face in town. He owned a restaurant called Aykroyd's Ghetto House CafÃ© on upper Princess Street during the 1990s which prominently featured a Blues Brothers' car projecting out from the second story wall.

==Education==
[[Image:Queenstheologicalhall.jpg|thumb|Theological Hall at [[Queen's University]] ]]
Kingston is the site of two universities, [[Queen's University]] and the [[Royal Military College of Canada]], and a [[community college]], [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]]. According to Statistics Canada, Kingston has the most PhD-holders per capita of any city in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.canoe.ca/Travel/Canada/2009/03/23/8857616.html |title=CANOE Travel - Canada - Smartest city in Canada |publisher=Travel.canoe.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen's University===
[[Queen's University]] is one of Canada's oldest universities and offers a variety of degree programs. The university was founded in 1841 under royal charter from Queen Victoria. It currently has an enrollment of more than 13,000 undergraduate and 4,000 graduate students. Queen's Campus is rather self-contained but is in close walking distance to downtown Kingston, making it a pedestrian friendly university for students and faculty alike.

===Royal Military College of Canada===
The [[Royal Military College of Canada]], established in 1876, is Canada's only military university (''CollÃ¨ge Militaire Royal'' in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]] is a military [[CEGEP]]), providing academic and leadership training to [[Officer Cadet|officer cadets]], other members of Canada's [[Canadian Forces|armed forces]] and civilians. There are currently 1,100 undergraduate students and 500 full and part-time graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucc.ca/can_uni/our_universities/rmc_e.html |title=Directory of Canadian Universities - RMC |publisher=Aucc.ca |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Correctional institutions and facilities==
Kingston has the largest concentration of federal correctional facilities in Canada. The facilities are operated by the [[Correctional Service of Canada]]. Of the nine institutions located in the Kingston area, seven of them are located within the municipal boundaries of the city. 
* [[Kingston Penitentiary]] (maximum security)
* ''Regional Treatment Centre'' (multi-level security), co-located within Kingston Penitentiary
* ''Joyceville Institution'' (medium security)
* ''Pittsburgh Institution'' (minimum security), co-located with Joyceville
* ''Collins Bay Institution'' (medium security)
* ''Frontenac Institution'' (minimum security), co-located with Collins Bay
* [[Millhaven Institution]] (maximum security), and ''Bath Institution'' (medium security), are located in the nearby village of [[Bath, Ontario|Bath]].

Until 2000, Canada's only federal correctional facility for women, the [[Prison For Women]] (nicknamed &quot;P4W&quot;) was also located in Kingston. As a result of the report of the ''Commission of Inquiry into Certain Events at the Prison for Women in Kingston'', the facility was closed in 2000. Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation and Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is currently considering its options.

==Geography and climate==
Kingston is located at {{Coord|44|13|12|N|76|28|48|W|city}} (44.22, â76.48),{{GR|1}} and is located in [[hardiness zone 5]]. Kingston has a moderate [[humid continental climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb''), but with cooler summers and sharper winters than most of [[Southern Ontario]].  Although proximity to Lake Ontario has a moderating effect on the climate, it also tempers the heat and can on occasion increase precipitation, especially during heavy snowfall events.  Mild to strong breezes off of Lake Ontario make Kingston one of the most consistently windy cities in Canada, especially near the water. 

The central part of the city is located between the [[Cataraqui River]] to the east and the [[Little Cataraqui Creek]] to the West, with outlying areas extending in both directions. The eastern part of the city is accessible by the [[La Salle Causeway]] on [[Highway 2 (Ontario)|Highway 2]].

Major features of Kingston's waterfront include [[Flora MacDonald Confederation Basin]], [[Portsmouth Olympic Harbour]], [[Collins Bay, Ontario|Collins Bay]], [[Wolfe Island (Ontario)|Wolfe Island]], [[Garden Island (Ontario)|Garden Island]], the [[Cataraqui River]] (including the [[Kingston, Ontario Inner Harbour|Inner Harbour]] and, within that, [[Anglin Bay]]).

===Hockey===
Although contested, Kingston lays claim to being the birthplace of [[ice hockey]]. This is supported by a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''&quot;Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice.&quot;''.&lt;ref name='queens'&gt;{{cite web | title=Hockey night in Kingston| url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |accessdate=June 21, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between [[Queen's University]] and the [[Royal Military College of Canada]]. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.

The [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between [[Royal Military College of Canada|RMC]] and [[West Point]] in 1923. 

Kingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League|OHL]] by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]], and in [[OPJHL]] by the [[Kingston Voyageurs]]. The Frontenacs are coached by Kingston native [[Doug Gilmour]].

The [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], established in 1943 with a building constructed in 1965, is located in Kingston, near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950). New to the city is the [[K-Rock Centre]], located in the downtown core. The arena opened in February 2008, and serves as home ice for the Frontenacs. The Voyageurs play at the new Invista Centre, located in the city's west end.

Many prominent hockey people, [[National Hockey League|NHL]], [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:

===Sailing===
[[File:Royal Military College of Canada Robotic Sailboat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Military College of Canada]] Robotic Sailboat]]

The city is famous for its fresh-water sailing, and hosted the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|sailing events]] for the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. CORK â [[Canadian Olympic-training Regatta, Kingston]] â now hosted by CORK/Sail Kingston Inc. is still held every August. Since 1972, Kingston has hosted more than 40&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://k7waterfront.org/Topic/ListOfMajorRegattasInKingston |title=List of Major Regattas in Kingston - Kingston , Ontario waterfront |publisher=K7waterfront.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; World and Olympic sailing championships. Kingston is listed by a panel of experts among the best yacht racing venues in the USA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/news/04/racingsites-us/ |title=Scuttlebutt News Center: Best Racing Venues in the US |publisher=Sailingscuttlebutt.com |date=2004-06-16 |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though Kingston is, of course, in Canada.

Kingston sits amid excellent cruising and boating territory, with easy access to [[Lake Ontario]], the [[St. Lawrence River]], and the [[Thousand Islands]] including the [[St. Lawrence Islands National Park]].

Kingston is also home to the youth sail training ship called the [[St. Lawrence II]].

During the summers, the RMC campus in Kingston plays host to a Sea Cadet camp called HMCS Ontario, which provides sail training along with lots of other training to youth from across Canada. The Kingston Yacht Club located in downtown Kingston has a learn to sail program for both children and adults.

===Diving===
Kingston is a well-known destination for fresh-water [[wreck diving]]. Some of Kingston's wrecks can be classed among the best fresh water wrecks in the world. Kingston's wrecks are well preserved by its cool fresh water, and the recent [[zebra mussel]] invasion has caused a drastic improvement in water clarity that has enhanced the quality of diving in the area.

===Golf===
The Kingston area has eight golf courses, two of which are entirely public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontgolf.ca/city.php?city=kingston OnGolf.ca - Kingston Golf Courses - Ontario Canada] Retrieved 2011-03-02&lt;/ref&gt; The Kingston Golf Club, established in 1884, was a founding member of the [[Royal Canadian Golf Association]] in 1895. The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (designed by [[Stanley Thompson]]). Green also helped design several courses in eastern Ontario, including Smiths Falls (1949), Glen Lawrence (1955), Rideau Lakes (1961), Amherstview (1971), Garrison (1971), Belle Park (1974), Rivendell (1979), and Colonnade (1984). [[Matt McQuillan]], a professional player on the [[PGA Tour]] for the 2011 season, was born and raised in Kingston, and developed his game at the [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]]. McQuillan won the 2005 Telus [[Edmonton]] Open on the [[Canadian Professional Golf Tour]].

===Curling===
Three curling clubs are located in the Kingston area: the Cataraqui Golf &amp; Country Club, Garrison Golf &amp; Curling Club, and the [[Royal Kingston Curling Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curlingrink.ca/city.php?city=kingston CurlingRink.ca - Kingston Curling Clubs and Rinks - Kingston, Ontario] Retrieved 2011-03-02&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Kingston Curling Club (RKCC) was founded in 1820, and was granted Royal patronage in 1993. In 2006, the RKCC moved to a new facility, to make way for the construction of a new complex at Queen's University, the Queen's Centre.

===Rugby===
The Kingston Panthers Rugby Football Club (KPRFC) was founded in 1959, and from that moment onward has established a reputation as a strong community player. KPRFC is a non-profit organization answering directly to the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union (EORU), the Ontario Rugby Union (ORU), and Rugby Canada (RC).  The Kingston Panthers R.F.C, recently celebrated their fortieth anniversary with an EORU championship in the Division 1 championship game at Twin Elms Rugby Pitch in Ottawa, Ontario.

===Football===
The earliest known incarnation of an organized football team in Kingston is the [[Kingston Granites]] which played in the predecessor league to the [[Canadian Football League]], the ORFU. The team played for four seasons between 1898 and 1901 winning 1 ORFU title in 1899 defeating the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] 8-0. The Limestone Grenadiers now represent Kingston and the surrounding area in the OVFL. The Club franchise catchment area draws players from Frontenac, Hastings, Lanark, Leeds, Lennox and Prince Edward counties. League play runs from late May through August. The Junior and Varsity teams' main schedule pits the Grenadiers against eastern Ontario opponents and cross-over games with western Ontario teams leading to a provincial title championship game.
Many prominent football people, CFL, NFL players, coaches and personalities have been associated with Kingston including:
*[[Chaucer Elliott]]
*[[Rob Bagg]]
*[[Dee Sterling]]
*[[Cory Greenwood]]
*[[Matt O'Donnell (Canadian football)]]
*[[Matt Kirk]]
*[[Oamo Culbreath]]
*[[Michael Giffin]]
