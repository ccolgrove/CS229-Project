'''Linpus Linux''' is a [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]]-based [[operating system]] created by the [[Taiwan]]ese firm Linpus Technologies Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=linpus Linpus Distrowatch article]&lt;/ref&gt;  Linpus was designed specifically to fully support the Asian market, with full [[Unicode]] support for the Chinese and Japanese languages. A special version, '''Linpus Lite''', was written to run on devices with lower-cost hardware such as [[netbook]]s. It has both an icon and tab-based &quot;Simple mode&quot;, designed for new users; and, a conventional style &quot;PC mode&quot; for those wanting a more [[Microsoft Windows]]-like interface. It is targeted at handheld devices with smaller screens, and supports resolutions as low as [[VGA]] (640Ã480).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecodingstudio.com/opensource/linux/screenshots/index.php?linux_distribution_sm=Linpus%209.4%20Lite Screenshots of Linpus Lite's &quot;easy mode&quot; and &quot;desktop mode&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] [[Aspire One]] and Norhtec Gecko&lt;ref&gt;[http://eeepc.itrunsonlinux.com/the-news/1-latest-news/249-acer-aspire-one-linpus-linux-lite-recovery-dvd-online Acer Aspire One Linpus Linux Lite recovery DVD online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7223327753.html Low-cost laptop runs Linpus Linux]&lt;/ref&gt; [[netbook]]s come with Linpus Lite Linux pre-installed, there is also a version of the [[AspireRevo|Acer Revo]] 3610 with Linpus Linux pre-installed.

A version for normal desktop computers and servers is also available, as well as a Multimedia version called Linpus Media Center.  The Media Center version offers an &quot;Upgrade pack&quot; to purchase [[software patent|patent]] licenses from [[MPEG-LA]] for [[DVD]], [[MP3]], [[WMV]] and a few other [[codec]]s.

==Nagware==
The Linpus system contains not only the [[free and open source software|free and open source]] operating system, but also Acer-specific &quot;[[shareware]]&quot; - users  classify this as &quot;[[nagware]],&quot; because it asks you to register on Acer's website and purchase a full version.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The fact that the Acer distribution contains this software that is not available in [[source code]] prevents the system from being considered a fully [[Free software|free]]/open operating system.
