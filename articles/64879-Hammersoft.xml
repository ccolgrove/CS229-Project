'''Lionel Hutz''' is a recurring character from the [[Animated cartoon|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]''.  He was voiced by [[Phil Hartman]], and his first appearance was in the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] episode &quot;[[Bart Gets Hit by a Car]]&quot;.  Due to the death of Hartman, his final speaking role was in the episode &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot;.  Hutz is a lawyer in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], albeit an incompetent one who is always desperate for cases, few of which he wins. Hutz is often depicted as being financially unsound, extremely poor and willing to do anything for cash.

== Role in ''The Simpsons'' ==
=== Personality ===
Lionel Hutz is an inept [[ambulance chaser]] and, according to [[Lisa Simpson]], a &quot;[[shyster]]&quot; whom the Simpsons nonetheless repeatedly hire as their lawyer (a fact remarked on by [[Marge Simpson]] in a typically self-aware aside).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Burns' Heir |episodelink=Burns' Heir |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Richdale, Jace; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1994-04-14 |season=5 |episode=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His legal practice, located in a [[shopping mall]], is named &quot;I Can't Believe It's A Law Firm!&quot; and also offers &quot;expert shoe repair&quot;. He often tries to entice potential clients with free gifts, including a &quot;smoking monkey&quot; doll, a pen that looks like a cigar, an exotic faux-pearl necklace, a business card that &quot;turns into a sponge when you put it in water,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Bart Gets Hit by a Car |episodelink=Bart Gets Hit by a Car |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1994-04-14 |season=2 |episode=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even a almost-full [[Orange Julius]] he once had handy.

Hutz is characterized as both a grossly incompetent lawyer and an unethical individual in general.
In the season 4 episode &quot;[[Marge in Chains]]&quot; he describes the following as his &quot;problem&quot; with Judge Snyder:
:&quot;Well, he's had it in for me ever since I kinda ran over his dog... Well, replace the word 'kinda' with 'repeatedly' and the word 'dog' with 'son'.&quot;
Hutz is a [[alcoholism|recovering alcoholic]]; also in &quot;Marge in Chains&quot;, he hastily leaves the courtroom after handling a bottle of [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] in order to consult his [[Twelve-step program|sponsor]], [[David Crosby]]. He then gives his closing statement, unaware that he is not wearing any pants and thinks that [[Clarence Darrow]] was &quot;The Black guy on [[The Mod Squad]]&quot;. Beyond the law, he also tries his hand at selling [[real estate]], reasoning that it was a natural move as most of his clients ended up losing their homes anyway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Realty Bites |episodelink=Realty Bites |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Greaney, Dan; Scott III, Swinton O. |network=Fox |airdate=1997-12-07 |season=9 |episode=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and out of desperation for work, [[babysitting]], where he produces a switchblade on awakening suddenly after nodding off to sleep, and also burns a lot of presumably incriminating documents in the Simpsons' fireplace, then claiming he is now &quot;Miguel Sanchez&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Marge on the Lam |episodelink=Marge on the Lam |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Canterbury, Bill; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1993-12-04 |season=5 |episode=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutz's incompetence and financial desperation sometimes lead him to resort to rooting through dumpsters, claiming they are client-related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Springfield Connection |episodelink=The Springfield Connection |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Collier, Jonathan; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1995-05-07 |season=6 |episode=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutz was briefly married to [[Patty and Selma Bouvier|Selma Bouvier]], although this storyline is not shown in an episode. Hutz has also been known to use a phone booth as an office.

Lionel Hutz does not seem to care about [[conflict of interest]]; in &quot;[[A Streetcar Named Marge]]&quot; he represents clients in a lawsuit against the producer(s) of a local production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' for not giving them any roles in the play, although he had a role himself.

Another display of his incompetence takes place in &quot;[[The Boy Who Knew Too Much]]&quot; when, while representing a [[French people|French]] [[waiter]] who is accusing [[Mayor Quimby|Mayor Quimby's]] nephew Freddy of battery, he is surprised when the opposing counsel mentions that Hutz's client is an immigrant (despite the client's French accent). Hutz then demands that his client tell him everything from then on. He also misunderstands simple legal terms like &quot;[[trial#Mistrials|mistrial]]&quot; and &quot;[[lawyer]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chains&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Marge in Chains]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cases won ===
Although Hutz loses most of his cases, he does win several cases for the Simpsons, for instance representing [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] in his case against the [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Captain McAllister|Sea Captain]] and the Frying Dutchman restaurant over its &quot;All You Can Eat&quot; offer (&quot;The most blatant case of false advertising since ''[[The Never Ending Story]]''&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=New Kid on the Block |episodelink=New Kid on the Block |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=O'Brien, Conan; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=1992-11-12 |season=4 |episode=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wins a case for [[Bart Simpson]], by proving that [[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show|Itchy]] was created by an old man named Chester J. Lampwick&amp;mdash;though the deciding factor of the case is mainly proven by Bart's footwork to collect the crucial piece of evidence, rather than Hutz's competency.  Hutz initiates the trial with zero credible evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Day the Violence Died |episodelink=The Day the Violence Died |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Swartzwelder, John; Archer, Wesley |network=Fox |airdate=1996-03-17 |season=7 |episode=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Hutz successfully sues [[Krusty the Klown]] after Bart consumes a jagged metal Krusty-O from a box of cereal, resulting in an inflamed appendix. After winning the case, Hutz gives Bart only $500 of the $100,000 settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title=Round Springfield |episodelink=Round Springfield |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=O'Brien, Conan; Archer, Wes |network=Fox |airdate=1995-04-30 |season=6 |episode=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won a case against Sideshow Bob, who was Mayor at that time, for electoral fraud, in which Bart and Lisa found evidence connected to it, as stated in &quot;[[Sideshow Bob Roberts]]&quot;.

The only other case technically won by Hutz was in &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]&quot;, where he represents Homer against [[Satan]] (represented as [[Ned Flanders]]). In a purportedly-deleted scene for this episode, as subsequently seen in &quot;[[The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular]]&quot;, Hutz's slogan is &quot;Cases won in 30 minutes or your [[pizza]] is free&quot;. After he thinks he has lost the case, he gives the Simpsons their pizza. However, Marge informs him that they did win. Then, he tells them that the box was empty anyway. In the video game ''[[The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run]]'', billboards can be seen around Downtown Springfield promoting Lionel Hutz' free pizza offer.

== Retirement ==
After Hartman's death in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9805/28/hartman/|title=Phil Hartman, wife die in apparent murder-suicide|accessdate=2007-06-08|date=1998-05-28|publisher=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hutz and Hartman's other main character, [[Troy McClure]], were retired out of respect.&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subjectlink = Matt Groening| interviewer = [[Terry Gross]]| title = Fresh Air| program = [[National Public Radio]]| callsign = [[WHYY-FM]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4249835| city = Philadelphia| date = 2004-12-29| accessdate = 2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last episode to feature Hutz speaking was the [[The Simpsons (season 9)|season 9 episode]] &quot;[[Realty Bites]]&quot;. Since the Simpson family frequently appears in court, other characters have represented the Simpsons in legal matters since Hutz's retirement. For example, in &quot;[[Sweets and Sour Marge]]&quot;, the equally-incompetent [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Gil Gunderson|Gil Gunderson]] stepped in. The [[List of recurring characters from The Simpsons#Blue Haired Lawyer|Blue Haired Lawyer]] (who is just as unethical yet very competent) has also served as the family's attorney. Lionel Hutz still appears infrequently in clip shows and flashbacks, as well as crowd scenes, but only in non-speaking roles. Hutz and McClure still appear in ''[[Simpsons Comics]]''.

== Reception ==
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named Hutz as one of their 15 favorite fictional television and film lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20189419_15,00.html|title=Best TV/Movie Lawyers: 15 Legal Eagles We'd Hire|accessdate=2008-04-09|date=2008-04-09|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
