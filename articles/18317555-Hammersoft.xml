|}The series between the two schools began in 1925, with Florida A&amp;M winning 25-0. B-CCâs first win came a year later, 12-0 in 1926. At one stretch, the Rattlers won 19 straight games including a 68-6 victory in 1959, a 97-0 win in 1960 and a 76-0 win in 1961. Overall, the Rattlers lead the 60-game series, 46-15-1.

Florida A&amp;M won the first Florida Classic game in 1978, 27-17, overcoming a 17-0 halftime deficit. The team went on to win the inaugural [[NCAA]] Division I-AA championship. Bethune-Cookman made the series competitive starting in 1973, winning 11 of their 14 series victories during that span, including a 58-52 overtime win in 2004, which was the first-ever three-peat for the âCats in the overall series, which dates back to the 1920s. Florida A&amp;M holds an 18-10 edge in the meetings since the instate rivalry moved from a home-and-home scenario to an annual neutral site game in [[Tampa Stadium]] in 1978.

The two schools went through a two-year hiatus in 1983 and 1984, when they could not agree on a playing site, but public pressure from alumni, fans and state officials brought them back to the negotiating table and they resumed the series in 1985. Bethune-Cookman won the rivalry renewal game, 31-27 in 1985.

The 1997-2007 games saw the Florida Classic revived to the point that it overshadowed the drawing power of the [[Bayou Classic]] in New Orleans, between [[Grambling]] and [[Southern University]] in terms of attendance. In 1998, 66,245 packed the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium for the game which determined the 1998 MEAC Championship and postseason invitations. In 1999, the game drew 70,125 fans to Orlando, the sixth-largest football event ever held in the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium. The 2000 MEAC title game, which drew 70,719, for a 31-28 thriller won by the Rattlers. The 2003 game stands as the largest crowd ever in the series - 73,358.

In 2005, the game made its debut on [[ESPNU]], the 24-hour college sports network, as a part of a commitment to broadcasting [[Historically black colleges and universities|HBCU]] games.

===Halftime Show and Battle of the Bands===
[[Image:BcuHPIM1681.jpg|thumb|left|The 14 Karat Gold Dancers of the BCU Marching Wildcats during halftime at the Florida Classic.]][[Image:The100.jpg|thumb|right|The FAMU [[Marching 100]] during halftime at the Florida Classic.]]  Marching bands from both universities compete during the Florida Classic halftime show and at various events during the weekend.

In a 2006 article, Orlando Weekly Magazine said, &quot;at most college football games, halftime is for beer runs and bathroom breaks. At the (Florida Classic), halftime is the reason to go.&quot;

Over the years fans have agreed with these types descriptions of the game's halftime show. They also point out that areas under the stadium clear out as fans go to their seats or stand on walkways located at the stadium's end zones because they provide unrestricted views of the football field and the halftime show.

Prior to the MEAC's contract with ESPN to broadcast the game, the two bands enjoyed almost unlimited time to perform their last, longest and undoubtedly best show of the year. In fact, in the 2002 Florida Classic halftime, both bands performed shows that were almost 45 minutes long, nearly tripling the halftime's allotment of only 30 minutes based on NCAA rules.

The rivalry between the two programs is also evident in phrases used by the bands' announcers. Although good friends, Horatio &quot;In Stereo&quot; Walker of Bethune-Cookman's Marching Wildcats and radio jockey Joe Bullard of FAMU's Marching &quot;100,&quot; don't express any kind words for the opponent band as they narrate their marching band's respective shows.

The marching bands' appeal is also used to attract fans to other events during the Florida Classic weekend. On Fridays, both bands perform after high school bands during the annual Florida Blue Battle of the Bands at [[Amway Center]]. Prior to 2007 while Walt Disney World was still a sponsor, both bands performed annually at a parade at one of the Walt Disney World parks.
