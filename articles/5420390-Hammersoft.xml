==History==
Fox Kids initially launched on 19 October 1996. Broadcast hours were between the hours of 06:00 and 19:00 and timesharing with [[Sky 2]] and later [[National Geographic Channel (UK)|National Geographic Channel]]. Eventually, broadcasting hours were extended to 22:00. Operating hours were extended again on 3 November 2003, when the channel began broadcasting 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

In April 2004, the Jetix brand was gently introduced to the UK and Ireland in the form of a programming block on [[Fox Kids]]. The Jetix programming line-up aired every day between the hours of 15:00 and 19:00. In September 2004, the block was also included in the morning line-up, airing between the hours of 07:00 and 09:00.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The [[Jetix]] block originally featured programmes such as; ''[[Shaman King]]'', ''[[Sonic X]]'', ''[[Digimon]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Jackie Chan Adventures]]'', ''[[Totally Spies]]'', ''[[Black Hole High]]'', ''[[MegaMan: NT Warrior]]'', ''[[Hamtaro]]'', ''[[Martin Mystery]]'', ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers Ninja Storm]]''.

Fox Kids was rebranded as Jetix at midnight on 1 January 2005. The Jetix programming blocks were dropped, and the shows that it contained were integrated into the normal programming schedule. Shortly after the rebranding, a new early-evening block was introduced named &quot;Jetix Max&quot;. The Jetix Max slot included such shows as; ''[[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]]'', ''[[Totally Spies]]'', ''[[Martin Mystery]]'', ''[[Funky Cops]]'', ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[PXG]]'' and ''[[Black Hole High]]''. The Jetix Max slot was dropped in June 2006, although it remained on other Jetix channels around Europe.

Following the launch of [[Disney XD]] in the US, [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] confirmed that Disney XD would launch in the UK on 31 August 2009, replacing the [[Jetix]] brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney XD Rebrand1&quot;&gt;

==Launch events==
{{Advert|date=February 2011}}
Disney XD launched with a huge launch campaign. Four launch initiatives were designed to introduce Disney XD to children in the UK:

â Beach Soccer&lt;br /&gt;
â Dance With Diversity&lt;br /&gt;
â Skate Britain&lt;br /&gt;
â World Record Attempt

===Beach Soccer===
Beach Soccer was a joint initiative between [[England Beach Soccer]] and Disney XD, holding Beach Soccer Roadshows across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themarketer.co.uk/whats-new/new-campaign/disney-channel-launches-beach-soccer-campaign/ Disney channel launches beach soccer campaign â The Marketer magazine]. Themarketer.co.uk (2009-05-25). Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  An artificial beach was built in each of the five locations, and beach soccer tournaments were held in Southampton, Nottingham, Minehead and Stockport culminating in a Beach Soccer final in Oxford Street, London on Saturday 29 August 2009.

Leading the programme was the England National Beach Soccer squad themselves, who were on hand to teach skills and drills and oversee the dayâs coaching sessions.

===Dance With Diversity===
[[Britain's Got Talent]] winners [[Diversity (dance troupe)]] helped to launch Disney XD by accepting a challenge to teach 100 young street dancers a one-off routine and then perform it in front of the crowds in Covent Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/video/Diversity-Perform-In-London-As-Disney-Launch-New-Channel-Disney-XD/Video/200908115356297?lpos=video_Article_Related_Content_Region_4&amp;lid=VIDEO_15356297_Diversity_Perform_In_London_As_Disney_Launch_New_Channel_Disney_XD Diversity Perform In London As Disney Launch New Channel Disney XD â Sky News Video Player]. News.sky.com (2009-08-07). Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  Diversity were given just a few days to teach the 100 young dancers the routine and how to perform it all together.

Disney XD set the challenge to Diversity to help inspire kids to learn new activities. The challenge was documented in the programme Disney XD Challenge: Diversity, which aired on Disney XD in September 2009.  the next x was the hit show.

Mitchell, who at 12 years old is the youngest member of Diversity, said: &quot;Weâve had so much fun creating this dance for Disney XD and I canât wait to watch the new channel!&quot;

===Skate Britain===
British skateboarding legend, Pete King, skated his way across the UK to help get kids out and skateboarding as part of the launch of Disney XD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.mpora.com/watch/UK8QHQJFE/ Pete King skates across the UK for the Disney XD Challenge // Skateboarding Videos]. Video.mpora.com. Retrieved on 2011-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From [[Landâs End]] to [[John OâGroats]], Pete King kick-flipped and tail-slided through the UK executing daredevil tricks whilst conducting masterclasses for kids looking to become the next British skateboarding stars.

Peteâs challenge was part of a series of challenges which Disney XD set for UK personalities to help inspire kids to try new activities. Viewers were able to watch the highlights of Peteâs journey on Disney XD in October 2009.

===World Record Attempt===
Friday 28 August saw history being made as 180 children came together to form a giant âhuman joystickâ to set the new world record for the biggest ever game of virtual keepy-uppy.

Former England and Liverpool football star and gaming fan, [[Jamie Redknapp]], led the bid to enter the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].

The game used cutting edge motion sensor technology and saw kids from across the country collectively heading a virtual football for as long as possible without it dropping.

Set at the Parklife site on Oxford Street, a giant television screen and live detection webcam connected to a series of computers tracked each kidâs movement as they headed straight into the record books. The crowdâs collective actions controlled a single game character and successfully kept a header-rally going.

As a first in the field, [[Guinness World Record]] adjudicator Gareth Deaves attended the event to monitor the attempt and after declaring the attempt a success presented the World Record certificate to [[Jamie Redknapp]] who accepted the award on behalf of Disney XD.

[[Jamie Redknapp]] said: âIâm really pleased to be involved in this activity&amp;nbsp;â itâs so important that kids get the opportunity to experience new things and being part of setting a World Record is a great achievement!â

Jamieâs challenge was the latest in a series which Disney XD set for UK personalities to help inspire kids to try new activities.

==Censorship==
As Disney XD is aimed at children aged 6 to 14, some shows are edited for content that is considered violent, scary or contains flashing images. Many of these edits have been brief and thus would not have been noticed had they not aired on other channels uncensored.  The most notable edits were on former Fox Kids/Jetix programmes ''[[Naruto]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[MegaMan NT Warrior]]'', and ''[[Power Rangers]]''.

==Magazine==
[[Future Publishing]] published the official Jetix Magazine until September 2009. Released every four weeks, the magazine featured puzzles and features based on the channel's characters as well as a six page Power Rangers comic. New issues contained a Sonic X comic based on the current Sonic X comic series by Archie. The magazine frequently included a free DVD featuring shows from the channel.

From 3 September the magazine became Nitro! due to [[Jetix]] rebranding as [[Disney XD]]. The magazine will still offer four free gifts per issue; however it will cover all major children's content rather than the content previously shown on [[Jetix]].
