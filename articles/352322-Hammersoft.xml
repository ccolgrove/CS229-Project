{{Mechanical failure modes}}
'''Structural failure''' refers to loss of the [[Structural load|load]]-carrying capacity of a component or member within a [[Architectural structure|structure]] or of the structure itself. Structural failure is initiated when the [[List of building materials|material]] is stressed to its [[Strength of materials|strength]] limit, thus causing fracture or excessive [[Deformation (engineering)|deformations]]. In a well-designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure. Ultimate failure strength is one of the [[limit state design|limit states]] that must be accounted for in [[structural engineering]] and [[structural design]].

=== Bridges ===
{{See also|List of bridge disasters}}

==== Dee bridge ====
{{Main|Dee bridge disaster}}
[[Image:Dee bridge disaster.jpg|thumb|The Dee bridge after its collapse]]
On 24 May 1847 the new railway bridge over the river Dee collapsed as a train passed over it, with the loss of 5 lives. It was designed by [[Robert Stephenson]], using [[cast iron]] girders reinforced with [[wrought iron]] struts. The bridge collapse was the subject of one of the first formal inquiries into a structural failure. The result of the inquiry was that the design of the structure was fundamentally flawed, as the wrought iron did not reinforce the cast iron at all, and that, owing to repeated flexing, the casting had suffered a brittle failure due to fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;Petroski, H. (1994) p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

==== First Tay Rail Bridge ====
{{Main|Tay Bridge disaster}}
The Dee bridge disaster was followed by a number of [[cast iron]] bridge collapses, including the collapse of the first '''[[Tay Rail Bridge]]''' on 28 December 1879. Like the Dee bridge, the Tay collapsed when a train passed over it causing 75 people to lose their lives. The bridge failed because of poorly made cast iron, and the failure of the designer [[Thomas Bouch]] to consider wind loading on the bridge. The collapse resulted in cast iron largely being replaced by steel construction, and a complete redesign in 1890 of the [[Forth Railway Bridge]]. As a result, the Forth Bridge was the first entirely steel bridge in the world.&lt;ref name=Tacoma&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Wake of Tacoma: Suspension Bridges and the Quest for Aerodynamic Stabilitya|author=Scott, Richard|year=2001|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=0784405425|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== First Tacoma Narrows Bridge ====
{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)}}
The 1940 collapse of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge is sometimes characterized in physics textbooks as a classical example of resonance; although, this description is misleading. The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated oscillation between the bridge and winds passing through it, known as [[aeroelastic flutter]]. [[Robert H. Scanlan]], father of the field of bridge aerodynamics, wrote an article about this misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;K. Billah and R. Scanlan (1991), ''Resonance, Tacoma Narrows Bridge Failure, and Undergraduate Physics Textbooks'', [[American Journal of Physics]], 59(2), 118--124 [http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; This collapse, and the research that followed, led to an increased understanding of wind/structure interactions. Several bridges were altered following the collapse to prevent a similar event occurring again. The only fatality was 'Tubby' the dog.&lt;ref name=Tacoma&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Wake of Tacoma: Suspension Bridges and the Quest for Aerodynamic Stabilitya|author=Scott, Richard|year=2001|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=0784405425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== I-35W Bridge ====
{{Main|I-35W Mississippi River bridge}}
[[Image:35wBridgecollapse.gif|thumb|200px|Security camera images show the I-35W collapse in animation, looking north.]]
The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially known simply as Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane steel [[truss arch bridge]] that carried [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|Interstate 35W]] across the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], United States. The bridge was completed in 1967, and its maintenance was performed by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]. The bridge was Minnesota's fifthâbusiest,&lt;ref name=&quot;MetroArea2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = 2006 Metro Area Traffic Volume Index Map| publisher =Mn/DOT|year=2006| url = http://www.dot.state.mn.us/traffic/data/maps/indexmaps/2006/metroindex.pdf| format =pdf| accessdate =9 August 2007}} Index map for Mn/DOT's 2006 traffic volumes; relevant maps showing the highest river bridge traffic volumes are Maps 2E, 3E, and 3F.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = week&gt;{{cite web | last = Weeks | first = John A.

=== Buildings ===
==== Ronan Point ====
{{Main|Ronan Point}}
On 16 May 1968 the 22 storey residential tower [[Ronan Point]] in the [[London Borough of Newham]] collapsed when a relatively small gas explosion on the 18th floor caused a structural wall panel to be blown away from the building. The tower was constructed of [[precast]] concrete, and the failure of the single panel caused one entire corner of the building to collapse. The panel was able to be blown out because there was insufficient reinforcement steel passing between the panels. This also meant that the loads carried by the panel could not be redistributed to other adjacent panels, because there was no route for the forces to follow. As a result of the collapse, building regulations were overhauled to prevent [[disproportionate collapse]] and the understanding of precast concrete detailing was greatly advanced. Many similar buildings were altered or demolished as a result of the collapse.&lt;ref name=ConstructionFailure&gt;{{cite book|title=Construction Failure|author=Feld, Jacob; Carper, Kenneth L.|year=1997|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0471574775|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oklahoma City bombing ====
{{Main|Oklahoma City bombing}}
On 19 April 1995, the nine story concrete framed [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma]] was struck by a huge car bomb causing partial collapse, resulting in the deaths of 168 people. The bomb, though large, caused a significantly disproportionate collapse of the structure. The bomb blew all the glass off the front of the building and completely shattered a ground floor reinforced concrete column (see [[brisance]]). At second story level a wider column spacing existed, and loads from upper story columns were transferred into fewer columns below by girders at second floor level. The removal of one of the lower story columns caused neighbouring columns to fail due to the extra load, eventually leading to the complete collapse of the central portion of the building. The bombing was one of the first to highlight the extreme forces that blast loading from terrorism can exert on buildings, and led to increased consideration of terrorism in structural design of buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virdi2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Abnormal Loading on Structures: Experimental and Numerical Modelling|author=Virdi, K.S.|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0419259600|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Versailles wedding hall ====
{{Main|Versailles wedding hall disaster}}
The Versailles wedding hall ({{lang-he|××××× ××¨×¡××}}), located in [[Talpiot]], [[Jerusalem]], is the site of the worst civil disaster in [[Israel]]'s history. At 22:43 on Thursday night, May 24, 2001 during the wedding of Keren and Asaf Dror, a large portion of the third floor of the four-story building collapsed. 

==== World Trade Center ====
{{Main|Collapse of the World Trade Center}}
In the [[September 11 attacks]], two commercial airliners were deliberately crashed into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center]] in New York City. The impact and resulting fires caused both towers to collapse within two hours. After the impacts had severed exterior columns and damaged core columns, the loads on these columns were redistributed. The hat trusses at the top of each building played a significant role in this redistribution of the loads in the structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIST&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = NIST's Responsibilities Under the National Construction Safety Team Act | url = http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/constructionact.htm | accessdate = 23 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The impacts dislodged some of the fireproofing from the steel, increasing its exposure to the heat of the fires. Temperatures became high enough to weaken the core columns to the point of [[creep (deformation)|creep]] and [[Plastic deformation#Deformation theory|plastic deformation]] under the weight of higher floors. Perimeter columns and floors were also weakened by the heat of the fires, causing the floors to sag and exerting an inward force on exterior walls of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;BazantWhy&quot;&gt;{{cite paper |last=BaÅ¾ant |first=ZdenÄk P. |authorlink=ZdenÄk BaÅ¾ant |coauthor=Jia-Liang Le, Frank R.

[[Image:Boeing B-52 with no vertical stabilizer.jpg|thumb|right|A 1964 [[B-52 Stratofortress]] test demonstrated the same failure that caused the [[1963 Elephant Mountain B-52 crash|1963 Elephant Mountain]] &amp; [[1964 Savage Mountain B-52 crash|1964 Savage Mountain crashes]].]]
Repeated structural failures of aircraft types occurred in 1954, when 2 [[de Havilland Comet#Comet disasters of 1954|de Havilland Comet C1 jet airliners]] crashed due to decompression caused by [[metal fatigue]], and in 1963-4, when the [[vertical stabilizer]] on 4 [[B-52 Stratofortress#Upgrades and modifications|Boeing B-52 bombers]] broke off in mid-air.

==== Warsaw Radio Mast ====
{{Main|Warsaw radio mast}}
On 8 August 1991 at 16:00 UTC Warsaw radio mast, the tallest man-made object ever built before the erection of [[Burj Khalifa]] collapsed as consequence of an error in exchanging the guy-wires on the highest stock. The mast first bent and then snapped at roughly half its height. It destroyed at its collapse a small mobile crane of Mostostal Zabrze. As all workers left the mast before the exchange procedures, there were no fatalities, in contrast to the similar collapse of [[WLBT Tower]] in 1997.

==== Hyatt Regency walkway ====
{{Main|Hyatt Regency walkway collapse}}
[[Image:HRWalkway.svg|right|thumbnail|Design change on the Hyatt Regency walkways.]]On 17 July 1981, two suspended walkways through the lobby of the [[Hyatt Regency]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], collapsed, killing 114 and injuring 200 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Buildings Fall Down|author=M. Levy, M. Salvadori|publisher=Norton &amp; Co.|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a tea dance. The collapse was due to a late change in design, altering the method in which the rods supporting the walkways were connected to them, and inadvertently doubling the forces on the connection. The failure highlighted the need for good communication between design engineers and contractors, and rigorous checks on designs and especially on contractor-proposed design changes. The failure is a standard case study on engineering courses around the world, and is used to teach the importance of ethics in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Feld, J.; Carper, K.L. (1997) p.214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitbeck, C. (1998) p.115&lt;/ref&gt;
