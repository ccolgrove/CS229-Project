'''Mozilla Firefox, Portable Edition''' (formerly known as '''Portable Firefox''' and commonly known as '''Firefox Portable''') is a repackaged version of [[Mozilla Firefox]] created by [[John T. Haller]]. The application allows Firefox to be run from a [[USB flash drive]],&lt;ref name=&quot;maximum pc&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CD-ROM]], or other portable device on any [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computer or [[Linux]]/[[UNIX]] computer running [[Wine (software)|Wine]]. The program does not require Firefox to be installed on the computer, nor does it leave personal information on the computer or interfere with any installed versions of Firefox, though installation on a hard drive is possible.

It is compatible with Windows [[Windows 2000|2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]], and [[Windows 7|7]] as well as [[Wine (software)|Wine]] on [[UNIX]]-based systems. Although version 3 has serious compatibility issues with [[WinPE]] XP and [[BartPE]] XP, the old version 2.0.0.20 is compatible with [[Windows 98]], [[Windows Me|Me]], and PE XP.

==Differences from Mozilla Firefox==
Firefox Portable retains all of Mozilla Firefox's abilities such as [[Browser extension|extensions]] and automatic updating. Modifications to reduce the number of writes to the flash drive have also been added. The [[cache]] and browser history were previously disabled under the release of 2.0. Firefox Portable's ability to delete cookies and the download history on exit is not enabled by default, as per a licensing agreement with [[Mozilla Corporation|Mozilla]].

Personal settings, [[Internet bookmark|bookmarks]], and any installed extensions and [[Theme (computing)|themes]] are stored on the flash drive along with Firefox Portable. This allows the user to move from computer to computer without losing application settings.  [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugin]]s such as [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] and [[Macromedia Shockwave|Shockwave]] cannot be installed to Portable Firefox in the usual sense, but the plug in files can be copied from a local installation to the appropriate portable folder.&lt;ref name=&quot;support&quot;&gt;http://portableapps.com/support/firefox_portable Retrieved on 2009-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
* Launcher â Performs a number of functions including: adjustment of paths to external programs (mime types), adjustment of paths to local homepages, intelligent recreation of the component registry as you move drives, backup/restore of certain registry keys in certain instances, cleaning of folders and directories in certain instances, adjustment of some extension setting paths making non-portable extensions portable.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod&quot;&gt;http://portableapps.com/support/firefox_portable#modifications  Retrieved on 2009-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Default Profile â A default profile exists within the Firefox directory with settings to improve portability.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod&quot; /&gt;
* No Default Browser Check â Firefox won't check to see if it is the default browser on start up.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod&quot; /&gt;
* Download Prompt â Firefox will ask where to save downloads.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod&quot; /&gt;
* No Disk Cache â The browser disk cache has been disabled to decrease disk size and the number of writes to the disk, possibly increasing disk life.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod&quot; /&gt;
* Update Prompt â As updating the browser on a flash drive can be very slow, Firefox Portable asks you if you'd like to update rather than doing it automatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;mod&quot; /&gt;

==Issues==
*Add-ons and extensions appear to take longer to install.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhub&quot;&gt;http://www.brighthub.com/office/home/reviews/28332.aspx Retrieved on 2009-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Constant read-writes to an external flash drive may decrease the life expectancy of the drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhub&quot; /&gt;
*Multiple profiles are not supported (a somewhat hidden feature in the official Firefox); however, PortableApps.com released Multiple Profile Support for Firefox Portable.&lt;ref name=&quot;profiles&quot;&gt;http://portableapps.com/news/2010-01-21_-_multiple_profiles_for_mozilla_firefox_et_al Retrieved on 2010-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt;
