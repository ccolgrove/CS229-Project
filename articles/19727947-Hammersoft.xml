&quot;'''The Scaffold'''&quot; is a song by [[Elton John]] with lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]]. It is the seventh track off his first album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''.

==Musical structure==
It opens with a bluesy minor-key electric piano, before going into a somewhat quiet, relaxed main riff. A rhythm section plays a steady beat, but is more silent compared to other tracks. It changes between major and minor keys, making the music very confusing.

==Lyrical meaning==
Taupin wrote the song as a tribute to [[The Scaffold]], a group of comedians, musicians and poets from [[Liverpool]]. One of the members were [[Mike McGear]], [[Paul McCartney]]'s baby brother. The song praises them in the chorus, but the verses are very cryptic and mysterious. One might think that the influence could have been Bob Dylan; the first two verses go:

&quot;''In Orient where wise I was&lt;br /&gt;
''To please the way I live&lt;br /&gt;
''Come give the beggar chance at hand&lt;br /&gt;
''His life is on his lip 

''Three score a thousand times&lt;br /&gt;
''Were once in Amazon&lt;br /&gt;
''Where Eldorado holds the key&lt;br /&gt;
''No keeper holds my hand''&quot; 

John appeared on some of The Scaffold's album as a musician. Both John and Taupin were big fans.

==Performances==
Along with the previous song on the album, &quot;[[Sails (song)|Sails]]&quot;, this was also performed on John's first solo radio performance. Since then, it hasn't been played in any format.
