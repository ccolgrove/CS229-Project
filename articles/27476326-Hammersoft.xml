'''Unreachable''' is a song by [[John Frusciante]] which appeared as third track on his 2009 album ''[[The Empyrean]]''.

[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]] said about the song: &quot;The Empyrean is not like a RHCP's album that is chock-full of possible hit singles, but the track &quot;Unreachable&quot; does come close. Out of all the tunes, &quot;Unreachable&quot; is one of the most accessible between the hummable chorus and the infectiously grooving electric piano line.&quot;

[[Michael Balzary|Flea]] plays bass on the track.
