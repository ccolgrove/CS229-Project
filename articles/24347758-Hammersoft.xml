The '''[[Akron Zips]] men's soccer team''' is an intercollegiate [[Varsity team|varsity sports]] team of the [[University of Akron]]. The team is a member of the [[Mid-American Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]].  Akron is regularly ranked in the Top 10 [[NSCAA]] Collegiate men's soccer poll, and have achieved the #1 ranking in 2005, 2009 and 2010.  The Zips have played their home games at [[FirstEnergy Stadium-Cub Cadet Field]] since 1966, formerly named Lee R. Jackson Soccer Field and Cub Cadet Field. They won their first national championship in 2010.

== History ==
In [[1954]], an [[Oberlin College]] transfer named Stu Parry started the soccer team at Akron.  That year, they finished the season with two wins and one tie.  The next year, men's soccer was officially offered by the University and after starting the season with two losses, they ended with a 2-4-1 record, with the team's first win coming against rival [[Kent State Golden Flashes|Kent State]].

Parry eventually led the team to nine Ohio College Soccer Association titles as well as six NCAA playoff appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;media&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Program Timeline |url= http://www.gozips.com//pdf5/634753.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=10800|year= 2009| work= 2009 University of Akron Men's Soccer Media Guide|publisher= [[University of Akron]]|format=PDF|accessdate= 21 September 2009|page= 37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, the men's soccer team gained the most exposure in the NCAA tournament, finishing second to [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]] by a score of 1-0.  A Duke player, Ken Lolla, took over the program in 1993 and then became Akron's all-time winningest coach, with a record of 160-68-25.  He also led the team to their first #1 ranking, which was also the first ever MAC team in any sport to be ranked #1.&lt;ref name=media/&gt;

== Colors and badge ==
The team uses the school colors of blue and gold.

== Stadium ==
Lee Jackson Field was dedicated on October 22, 1966.  Along with the soccer venue, the {{convert|23|acre|m2|adj=on}} complex also includes fields for the school's baseball, softball, and track and field competition areas along with a practice field for the [[Akron Zips football|football team]].  The fields are located towards the southeast corner of the University of Akron campus, just west of [[Summa Field at InfoCision Stadium|InfoCision Stadium]].

Other expansion and upgrade plans for the stadium have included a grandstand with seating capacity of 2,200, berm seating around the stadium with a capacity of 2,600, and lighting which meets national television specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Home Field Advantage|work= 2009 University of Akron Men's Soccer Media Guide|url= http://www.gozips.com//pdf4/634651.pdf?DB_OEM_ID=10800|pages= 4â5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Announced in March of 2011 was a partnership between The University of Akron and [[Cub Cadet]], the premier brand of Cleveland-based MTD Products, which will rename the Zips' new, state-of-the-art grass soccer field [[Cub Cadet Field]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Men's Soccer Announces 2011 Fall Schedule |work= GoZips.com|url=http://www.gozips.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=47176&amp;SPID=4334&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10800&amp;ATCLID=205127144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2011, the field was renamed FirstEnergy Stadium-Cub Cadet field after Cub Cadet as well as [[First Energy]] plans were announced to build 300 new bleacher seats, permanent restrooms, and a concession stand along with the renaming.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uakron.edu/im/online-newsroom/news_details.dot?newsId=2041333&amp;crumbTitle=FirstEnergy%20StadiumâCub%20Cadet%20Field%20is%20new%20name%20for%20soccer%20venue&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supporters ==
The AK-ROWDIES are a student organization which cheer on sports teams in various sports at the University.  The ROWDIES were formed as an official student organization in 2005.  During the soccer games, they can be found behind the goal area, heckling the opponent's goalie. You will also hear all of their soccer cheers and chants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeff |last=Wheeler |title='Rowdie' for UA sports |url=http://media.www.buchtelite.com/media/storage/paper1203/news/2007/11/20/News/rowdie.For.Ua.Sports-3110964.shtml |newspaper=The Buchtelite |publisher=College Publisher |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
