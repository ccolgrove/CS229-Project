'''Latitude''' is [[Dell|Dell's]] business laptop [[Brand name|brand]], designed and manufactured mainly by [[Compal]] and [[Quanta]].

==Overview and product type==

The Dell Latitude is targeted for business use. This means that standardized parts are used throughout the line and are available for several years for support purposes. By contrast, the [[Dell Inspiron]] is aimed at the consumer market and its specifications change regularly. Whereas Inspiron may change vendors on components several times over the course of a single model, the Latitude line generally retains identical components throughout its production. This design is intended to simplify maintenance and support tasks for large corporations, allowing components to be easily swapped between models.

Dell Latitude computers are also built to Dell's RoadReady specification which includes a durable magnesium-alloy casing (though budget version D500/E5000-series Latitudes are mainly plastic), internal metal frames and Strike Zone shock protection in case the computer is dropped or suffers a severe impact. Many models also feature free-fall sensors or [[solid-state drive]]s. Latitude models are also considered {{Weasel-inline|date=March 2009}} more durable and higher quality than the Inspiron line, and even above the premium Studio and XPS models. The Ultraportable 4-series and mainstream 6-series Latitude models have 3 year US-based support, as opposed to the 1 year warranty on other models. The essential Latitudes retain the 1 year warranty of other products.But, this results in a price several hundreds of dollars higher compared to the consumer models.

Latitude computers are also differentiated in their feature sets, due to their business focus. For example, they often include security features such as smartcard and contactless smartcard, and TPM security, which are not needed by most consumers. A lid clasp (as opposed to a magnetic latching system), DisplayPort video out (as opposed to HDMI), and support for legacy standards are all results of the requirements of the business market.

Some models also have the capability of [[Latitude ON]] which can be selected during the configuration of the laptop.  Latitude ON is essentially a system within a system.  It requires a separate add on module which contains its own [[microprocessor]] and [[Operating system]].  This allows the laptop to function in the realm of a [[Netbook]].

The primary competitors to the Latitude series are the Lenovo [[Thinkpad]] line and the [[HP Elitebook]] line, both of which offer similar business oriented features and durability of the Latitude line.

{{As of | 2011}} Dell's Latitude shipments primarily involve the Latitude E-series, introduced in August 2008, on the Exx00 revision. All E-series models ending in &quot;00&quot; have the Intel Centrino 2 (Montevina) chipset, as well as some variation of the Intel Celeron or Intel Core 2 Duo processors. The mainstream models are separated into two categories: essential and standard. The essential models are the E54x0 and E55x0, while the standard models are the E64x0 and E65x0. The E64x0 and E65x0 generally use higher end materials like Tri-metal (magnesium alloy) for the chassis, while E5xx0 lines tend to have a plastic chassis (though the new E5420 and E5520 appear to feature Tri-metal casing [http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-e5420/pd]). The E6xx0 lines also generally offer higher-end features like dedicated graphics.

The Latitude series also include a number of specialty models.  The E42x0 and E43x0 are ultra-portable notebooks.  The Latitude E64x0 ATG is a ruggedized version of the E64x0, and is Dell's only semi-rugged offering. Dell's fully rugged offering, the XFR, has transitioned from the D to the E series. The Latitude XT is a touch-screen convertible-tablet computer. Other models like the 13 and the Z have been added to the line also.

Like previous models, the E series has the ability for a second (3-cell) battery in the modular bay. A 9-cell &quot;battery slice&quot; can also be purchased.  The battery slice uses the docking connector located on the bottom of the laptop to provide additional power.  As a draw-back, the laptop can not be docked while the battery is in place and the battery requires a separate charger. However, with the inclusion of the extra battery, the overall run time for the E series is substantially greater when compared to other Latitude series computers.

The previous series is the Latitude D-series, on the Dx30 revision. The models are the D4x0 (12.1&quot; Ultra Mobile), D5x0 (15,4&quot; AMD Processor Value model), D6x0 (14.1&quot; Corporate model) and D8x0 (15.4&quot; high-resolution model) most models are based on the Intel [[Core 2 Duo]] and the Intel Santa Rosa chipset, with the exception being the D531. Ever since the D420, D620, and D820, the D-series features wide aspect LCD screens: 12.1&quot;, 14.1&quot;, and 15.4&quot; respectively.

The Latitude D620 weighs 4.7 [[pound (mass)|lb]], and the base model includes a 1.67&amp;nbsp;GHz Intel Core Duo T2300 processor (667&amp;nbsp;MHz front-side-bus) and 2 [[megabyte|MB]] (2 [[mebibyte|MiB]]) of L2 cache. There is an option to upgrade to a Core 2 Duo T7X00 processor (667&amp;nbsp;MHz front-side-bus) with 4 MB of L2 cache. It comes standard with 512 MB of DDR2 RAM, expandable to 4 [[gigabyte|GB]] (4 [[gibibyte|GiB]]), and four USB ports. For graphics, it offers the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator x3100, and an option to upgrade to NVIDIA discrete graphics at the expense of lower battery life.

===Latitude D6x0 series===
The Latitude D6x0 series is the 14&quot;/14.1&quot; corporate model. It aims to combine heavy-duty power with reasonable portability, and differs primarily from D8x0 series in screen size.  All are two spindle designs, with a &quot;D-bay&quot; modular bay which can interchange optical drives, a second hard drive, floppy disk or a second battery.  All models have a smart card socket, PCMCIA socket, and 9-pin serial port, a &quot;D-dock&quot; port for docking station or port replicator, and have an internal socket for a 802.11 wireless card.

The D600 and D610 share a common form factor, battery socket, and have a parallel printer port.

The D620 and D630 share a common form factor, battery socket, and do not have a parallel printer port. Both have support for an optional internal Bluetooth module, a socket for an optional mobile broadband card, and have an external switch for disabling any wireless connections.

====Latitude D600====
The D600 (and simultaneously introduced D800) was Dell's first business-oriented notebook based on the Pentium-M processor; it used the first-generation &quot;Banias&quot; or Dothan Pentium M chips running on a 400 MT/s FSB on DDR memory.  It had a PATA hard drive and a D-series modular bay, and used an ATI GPU Radeon 9000.  It had a 14&quot; screen, in regular (non-widescreen) form factor.  Unlike later D6x0 series machines, both memory sockets were accessible from a single cover on the bottom of the system.

Many Latitude models had a near-clone Inspiron, in the case of the D600, it was the Inspiron 600M.  Differences include that the 600M does not work with the Dell D-Dock, and the case styling is slightly different. The motherboards, screens and hard drive caddies are all physically interchangeable.

The Latitude D600 used a PA-10/PA-12 charger came with a DVD drive 2 x USB 1 x TV 1 x Network 1 x parallel 1x serial and 1 monitor output. the hard drive is accessible through a cover on the left hand front side of the lower case and is secured by  1 screw the hard drive can then slide out.

====Latitude D610====
The D610 was an update of the D600 design; it used the same case design and very similar specs.  The chipset was updated (to the &quot;Sonoma&quot; platform) and used DDR2 memory, and it used a second-generation &quot;Dothan&quot; Pentium M chips running on a 533 MT/s FSB (and available in higher speeds.)  The location of one memory socket was moved to underneath the keyboard.  The D610 was available with either an ATI Mobility Radeon X300 discrete GPU or Intel integrated graphics. It still continued to use a PATA hard drive and D-series modular bay.

Many Latitude models had a near-clone Inspiron, in the case of the D610, it was the Inspiron 610M.

=====Latitude D610 problems=====
Some Dell Latitude D610 units with a dedicated ATI x300 graphics card seem to have problems with the audio-out jack. Symptoms of this problem include a noise or whine when an audio device is connected to the audio-out jack. Up to this date Dell does not have a clear solution to this problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;support.dell.com&quot;&gt;http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/dsn/en/document?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;dl=false&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;docid=F3787DCCC033918BE030030ABB627371&amp;doclang=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neilslade.com/DellLatitudeAudioBuzzNoiseUSB.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2472&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/dell-latitude-d610/1996-3121_7-31268759.html?ctype=msgid&amp;messageSiteID=7&amp;messageID=1010532&amp;cval=1010532&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Dell Latitude D610 units will develop microscopic fractures of the motherboard. Symptoms of this problem may include inability to turn on the computer, unexpected shut down within 30 seconds of being turned on, or visible screen artifacts while in operation. This problem also frequently contributes to the [[blue screen of death]] (BSOD) in Windows.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

====Latitude D620====
The D620 (and simultaneously introduced D820) was Dell's first business-oriented notebook with a dual core processor available.  Initially available with the interim &quot;[[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]]&quot; Core Duo processors, it was sold with the first-generation mobile &quot;[[Merom (microprocessor)|Merom]]&quot; Core 2 chips once those became available from Intel in the Fall of 2006; both run on a 667MT/s bus.  It was initial sold only with Intel integrated graphics, but an option to upgrade to a discrete NVidia GPU became available after a few months.  It replaced the raised pointing stick with a &quot;low profile&quot; model, and introduced the option of 4-cell and 9-cell batteries in addition to the standard 6-cell model.  It uses DDR2 memory and is compatible with both PC2-4200 (533&amp;nbsp;MHz) and PC2-5300 (667&amp;nbsp;MHz) memory.

Although the D620 is capable of accepting 4 GB of physical memory, but because of the limitation by the BIOS of a notebook (and not because the user is using a 32-bit or 64-bit OS), it will only see 3.5 GB of memory, or 3.3 with on board video (memory is shared). Using a 64-bit OS will not help the user to see all 4 GB of RAM on the D620.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The D620 has one mono speaker located in the base below the touchpad. It has no option to expand to stereo without using external speakers or headphones.

There was no near-clone Inspiron model for the D620.

=====Latitude D620 problems=====
All early D620 models were known for faulty LCD screens. All of these early models suffered from light bleeding, where a black screen would show light bleeding in from the bottom of the screen. This wasn't fixed until almost a year into production. In addition, some D630 screens are known for having bad LCD pixels.
The D620, D630, D820 and D830 were available with a Intel integrated GMA or Nvidia Graphics Card. All Nvidia models will suffer from early failure of the graphics chip due to defective solder and &quot;underfill&quot; of the [[BGA]] graphics core as it responds to thermal fluctuations. This is attributed to a faulty manufacturing on part of Nvidia which caused a multimillion recall not only of some Dell notebooks but also some HP, Compaq and Apple products [http://www.nvidiasettlement.com/pdfs/NVF_NOT.pdf Affected models]. The failure manifests itself by stripes or &quot;artifacts&quot; on the LCD AND also an external screen or by the total absence of an image. There is no permanent fix for it and the early replacements by Dell included only the same but new faulty chips which will also fail eventually. So far only the models with the Intel graphics seem to have survived.
Dell tried to prolong the lifetime of the Nvidia chips with a BIOS update which causes the fan to run more continuously and thus reduce the strain from repeated heating/cooling cycles on the graphics chip. However all these chips will die eventually.

====Latitude D630====
The D630 is an update of the D620 design.  It differed most significantly in being based on the &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; (mobile 965) chipset, which supported the 800MT/s models of the mobile Core 2 Duo (both the Merom 7xx0 series and later the Penryn-based 8x00/9x00 series.)  It also had newer versions of the graphics processor options, support for Intel's &quot;Turbo Memory&quot; flash cache (although this uses the same card slot as the mobile broadband card), and support for internal Wireless-N.  It also added a 4-pin Firewire [[IEEE1394]] port. It uses DDR2 memory and is compatible with PC2-5300 (667&amp;nbsp;MHz) and PC2-6400 (800&amp;nbsp;MHz) memory will work, but at PC2-5300 speeds.

Unlike the D830, the D630 has non stereo speakers.

There was no near-clone Inspiron model for the D630.

====Latitude D630c====
The D630c was a slight variant model of the D630; it featured a &quot;manageable&quot; version of the motherboard chipset, and base configuration was slightly more powerful. Except for the chipset management, all of those &quot;base features&quot; were available as options on the regular D630.

===Latitude D8x0 series===
The Latitude D8x0 series is the 15.4&quot; corporate model; unlike the D600 and D610, all feature a widescreen form factor. All are two spindle designs, with a &quot;D-bay&quot; modular bay which can interchange optical drives,a floppy module, a second hard drive, or a second battery.  All models have a smart card socket, PCMCIA socket, and 9-pin serial port, a &quot;D-dock&quot; port for docking station or port replicator, and have an internal socket for a 802.11 wireless card.

The D800 was Dell's first widescreen Latitude.

The D8x0 series models roughly parallel the technology in the D6x0 models other than for screen size; they do not share a battery form factor with the D6x0 series.  The D820 and D830 add an ExpressCard socket, not available in the D6x0 series.  Although the D820 is capable of accepting 4&amp;nbsp;GB of physical memory, because of Intel 945 chipset limitations, it makes at most 3.5&amp;nbsp;GB of memory available to the installed operating system.

The near-clone Inspirons for the D800 and D810 were the Inspiron 8500 and 8600; there were no near-clones of the D820/D830.

===Latitude D5x0 series===
The Latitude D500 series is a set of &quot;entry level&quot; business models; they are built on a 15&quot; non-widescreen form factor, although models before the D530 were sold with both 14.1&quot; and 15&quot; screens (the 14.1&quot; having a wider bezel.)  They are fixed-optical-drive, 2-spindle devices, and roughly follow the technical generations (chipset and processor-wise) of the D6x0 and D8x0 series.  The D530 was Dell's last non-widescreen Latitude model.

The D531 was an AMD-based model, and less closely related to the other Dx30-series models but was based on the D820/D830 chassis.

===Latitude D4x0 series===
The D400 and D410 were 12&quot; non-widescreen (4:3 aspect ratio) ultra-portable notebooks, roughly following the technology of the comparable generations of the series. The D400 came with a ULV Pentium M (Banias). The D410 came with a ULV Pentium M (Dothan).

The D420 and D430 are 12.1&quot; widescreen ultra-portable notebooks. The D420 came with either an [Intel Core] Solo U1300 ULV 1.06&amp;nbsp;GHz or [Intel Core] Duo U2500 ULV 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz. The D430 came with either an Intel Core Solo U1400 ULV 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz or Intel Core 2 Duo U7600 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz; the U7700 Processor (1.33&amp;nbsp;GHz) was later made available as an option.

While the D8x0, D6x0 and D5x0 models were all introduced simultaneously with each generation, the D4x0 series were generally introduced a couple of months after their counterparts. Also, since they use ULV (ultra-low-voltage) processors and chipsets, and are generally less powerful, the technology does not correspond as closely as it does between other models in each generation - for example, the D420 uses the parallel ATA hard drive (1.8&quot;) rather than the SATA (2.5&quot;) interface in the D520/620/820.

In a 22C deg ambient the D430 U7700 processor has been measured to run from 62C deg at idle to 85C deg under heavy system loads, that is, within 10C deg of Intel's max. temperature rating for the processor.  The D4x0 series has been replaced by the E4200 model.

===Latitude C series===
The Latitude C-series notebooks covered the range of processors from the Pentium 166&amp;nbsp;MHz to the Pentium 4-M. Models in this series included the CP (Pentium processors), CPi (Pentium II processors), CPx, C600 and C800 (Mobile Pentium III processors), CPt, C500 and C510 (Celeron processors), C400, C610 and C810 (Pentium 3-M processors) and C640 and C840 (Mobile Pentium 4M).&lt;ref&gt;http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/my_systems_info/manuals?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=anavml&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Latitude C500.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A Latitude C500, ready for use]]

C series laptops were notable for their consistent and interchangeable accessories across this wide range of processors. The series was one of the first to offer the UXGA 1600x1200 resolution display and included a NVidia GeForce MX400 32&amp;nbsp;MB video accelerator to complement the display requirements. A robust design made it a favorite in harsher climates; however, this design lacked the visual appeal of many of its competitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnet.com.au&quot;&gt;http://www.zdnet.com.au/reviews/hardware/laptops/soa/Dell-Latitude-C840-Powerful-and-ugly/0,2000065761,120265151,00.htmhttp://www.zdnet.com.au/reviews/hardware/laptops/soa/Dell-Latitude-C840-Powerful-and-ugly/0,2000065761,120265151,00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular of the C-series included the C800, C810, C840, and later the C640.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The later C-series models mostly had near clones sold as the Inspiron 4000 and 8000 series:
* C840 cloned as the Inspiron 8200
* C810 cloned as the Inspiron 8100
* C800 cloned as the Inspiron 8000
* C640 cloned as the Inspiron 4150 and as the Inspiron 2650
* C610 cloned as the Inspiron 4100
* C600 cloned as the Inspiron 4000

An interesting note on the C840 is that it was the last Dell notebook (along with its sister models the Inspiron 8200 and Precision M50) to have both a &quot;fixed&quot; optical drive as well as a modular bay, making it a &quot;three-spindle&quot; notebook.  The modular bay could also be used for a second battery identical to the primary battery rather than a special modular bay battery.  It used a Pentium 4M processor and DDR SDRAM.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnet.com.au&quot;/&gt;
The Dell C840 also supports 2 gigabytes of ram.

===Other models===
The Latitude ATG was a highly toughened version of the D630, and was Dell's only semi-rugged offering, while their fully rugged offering consisted of the XFR.  The Latitude XT was a touch-screen convertible-tablet computer.  These models maintained high compatibility with the rest of the Latitude D family.

===Latitude XT problems===
In July 2008, Dell released [[multi-touch]] touch-screen drivers for the Latitude XT Tablet, claiming the &quot;industryâs first convertible tablet with multi-touch capabilities.&quot;[11] Dell has partnered with [[N-trig]], providers of DuoSenseTM technology, combining pen, capacitive touch and multi-touch in a single device. N-trigâs DuoSense dual-mode digitizer uses both pen and zero-pressure capacitive touch to provide a true Hands-onTM computing experience for mobile computers and other digital input products over a single device.

A large number of user reports suggest that the Dell Latitude XT suffers from a major problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/20/multi-touch-giving-dell-latitude-xt-users-fits/ Multi-touch display giving Dell Latitude XT users fits?]&lt;/ref&gt; The N-Trig digitizer interfaces to the XT by an internal USB port.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zproxy.wordpress.com/2008/10/08/n-trig-failure-to-open-device/ n-trig: Failure to open Device]&lt;/ref&gt; Users report that any other USB device which is plugged in may, and usually does, prevent the N-Trig applet (program which controls the features) from identifying the N-Trig hardware. In addition, there have been reports that certain other drivers, such as iTunes Helper, may cause this or a similar problem. Other users report no problems from iTunes. According to the reports, this still leaves the dual sense but without Multi-Touch and other advanced features, &quot;which render the auto and dual mode useless. The digitizer will only start working again after consecutive reboots.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/dell_latitude_xt_multitouch_screen_has_digitizer_issues Dell Latitude XT Multi-Touch Screen Has Digitizer Issues]&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports that the driver may crash, catastrophically or non-catastrophically, leaving no screen input at all. A re-boot may solve the problem, but often users found that the driver installation is damaged, requiring a re-installation of the drivers. But the install program will not un-install if it doesn't recognize the N-Trig hardware. In this case, the alternatives are (1) restore the entire operating system from backup, (2) manually un-install by erasing all N-Trig programs and drivers then editing the registry to remove all references to N-Trig, then re-install the N-Trig software, or (3) do a complete re-install of Windows.

These problems have been reported both with XP and Vista, 32 and 64 bit. In addition, Dell sells a MediaBase with an internal DVD drive. The drive also interfaces by way of a USB connection inside the MediaBase.  Most, but not all, users of the MediaBase report that it prevents the drivers from loading.

===NVidia GPU problems===
Basically all D620, D820, D630,and D830 models with NVidia mobile GPUs will experience [[GeForce_8_Series#GeForce_8M_Series|GPU overheating problems]].  A Class Action Lawsuit settlement by NVidia was reached where certain Dell models were provided with replacement motherboards at no expense.

===Battery recall affecting D Series===
Dell posted notices to many of their laptop customers on August 14, 2006, saying that the Sony batteries on the D410, D500, D505, D510, D520, D600, D610, D620, D800, and D810 models were prone to bursting into flames, or even exploding:[http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7807419][http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550]

The batteries on any of these computers purchased between April 2004 and July 18, 2006 were supposed to be removed and the computers run on AC power until replacements arrived.[https://www.dellsucksprogram.com/]  Problematic Sony batteries led to battery recall programs at other laptop companies, including Hitachi [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5411996.stm], Toshiba [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5390948.stm], Lenovo (IBM)[http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?sitestyle=lenovo&amp;lndocid=BATT-LENOVO] and Apple [https://support.apple.com/ibook_powerbook/batteryexchange/].

==System configuration==

The majority of Dell laptops are built to order.  Each generation incorporates the newest and latest technologies at the time of design.

*Processor: Depends on the model and configuration.
*Memory: Depends on the model and configuration
*Screen: Depends on the model and configuration.
*Operating System: [[Windows]], [[FreeDOS]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]
*Hard Drive: Depends on configuration.
*Ports: Most of Dell's current laptops have a minimum of two [[USB|USB ports]] and 1 Ethernet Port,
