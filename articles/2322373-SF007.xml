'''Jien''' ({{lang-ja|æå}}) (17 May 1155 in [[Kyoto]] &amp;ndash; 28 October 1225 in [[Omi]] (now [[Shiga]])) was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] poet, historian, and [[Buddhist monk]].

==Biography==
Jien was the son [[Fujiwara no Tadamichi]], a member of the [[Fujiwara family]] of powerful aristocrats. He joined a [[Buddhist]] monastery of the [[Tendai]] sect early in his life, first taking the Buddhist name ''Dokaie'', and later changing it to ''Jien''. He eventually rose to the rank of {{nihongo|'''DaisÅjÅ'''|å¤§å§æ­£||&quot;Archbishop&quot;}}, or leader of the Tendai sect.

He began to study and write [[Japanese history]], his purpose being to &quot;enlighten people who find it hard to understand the vicissitudes of life&quot;. His masterpiece, completed c. 1220, was humbly entitled, ''[[GukanshÅ]]'', which translates as ''Jottings of a Fool''. In it he tried to analyze the facts of Japanese history. The ''GukanshÅ'' held a ''[[mappo]]'' and therefore pessimistic view of his age, [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|The Feudal Period]], and claimed that it was a period of religious decline and saw the disintegration of civilization. This is the viewpoint generally held today. Jien claimed that changes in the [[feudal]] structure were necessary and defended the [[shogun]]'s claim of power.

As a poet, he was named one of the [[New Thirty-six Poetry Immortals]], and was the second-best represented poet in the ''[[Shin Kokin WakashÅ«]]''. He was included by [[Fujiwara no Teika]] in the ''[[Ogura Hyakunin Isshu]]''.
