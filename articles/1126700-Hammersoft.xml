The '''University of London Institute in Paris''' (abbreviated '''ULIP''') is a college of the [[University of London]] located in Paris. It is currently the only UK University Institute in Continental Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/london-institute-in-paris-university-of-459101.html |title=London Institute in Paris, University of - A-Z Unis &amp; Colleges , Getting Into University |publisher=The Independent |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:University of London Paris.JPG|left|thumb|upright|The University of London Institute in Paris is located on the [[Esplanade des Invalides]] in central [[Paris]]]]
The institute was established by an English woman, Edith Williams, in 1894&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecoledoctorale.sciences-po.fr/theses/theses_en_ligne/christine_okret_manville_histoire_2002/christine_okret_manville_histoire_2002.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Pagetitre.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the help of the then British Ambassador, [[Lord Dufferin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt; It was originally known as the &quot;Anglo-French Guild&quot;, which from 1894 offered classes in conversational English to French students soon to qualify as teachers of English through more theoretical studies. In 1900, French classes were added, aimed at British students spending time in Paris, and thus a unique Franco-British community was created. In the same year, the Guild established itself in the rue de la Sorbonne, opposite the University of Paris.

After the [[World War I|First World War]] the French and British governments, concerned by the lack of understanding between the British and French armies that had become apparent during hostilities, sought means of improving cultural and language links between their countries. The French government founded an Institut franÃ§ais du Royaume-Uni in London (South Kensington), while another British Ambassador to France, [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], launched a fund for the creation of a British Institute in Paris. This was to consist of a bi-cultural teaching establishment (the Guild, reorganised and expanded) and a Franco-British student hostel in the international [[CitÃ© Internationale Universitaire de Paris|CitÃ© Universitaire]], which was eventually opened in 1937 under the name CollÃ¨ge Franco-Britannique.

The British Institute left its [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] link to become incorporated into the University of London in 1969.

The British Institute was renamed the University of London Institute in Paris in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/the-french-connection-548061.html |title=The French connection - Higher, Education |publisher=The Independent |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Institute has been part of a successful collaboration between the University of London and two of its colleges: [[Queen Mary, University of London]] and [[Royal Holloway, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhul.ac.uk/Prospective-Students/international-students/study-abroad/Paris.html |title=Royal Holloway, University of London |publisher=Rhul.ac.uk |date=2007-12-01 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intention has been to strengthen the academic activities of the Institute and to align them more closely with what is expected of a research-focused university environment.

The Institute began life teaching oral English to the French, but was soon improving the oral [[French language|French]] of visiting British students. Currently the Institute only offers teaching of French Studies: the English language programme has been discontinued as ULIP has looked to develop itself as more of a research-led institute.

The Institute teaches a unique BA degree and the MA in Paris Studies and hosts a large number of academic seminars, workshops and conferences that bring together leading British and French scholars and scientists in a range of academic subjects, including Law and History.

Today ULIP is located in the [[British Council]] building&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulip.lon.ac.uk/ |title=Welcome to University of London Institute in Paris |publisher=Ulip.lon.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[The Independent]] newspaper has described as a ''&quot;lovely, traditional Paris building, in a great location overlooking the Esplanade des Invalides&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Its strength is that because it is a relatively small institution it can offer a more intimate learning experience than is available in a larger, more anonymous University. It has the unique advantage of allowing students to study French culture and language in the country itself whilst still offering the quality assurance of a British educational institution. The quality of its degrees is ratified by the University of London. As a result of these advantages the entrance requirements for students are quite high (AAB or ABB at [[A level]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/University_of_London_Institute_in_Paris |title=University of London Institute in Paris |publisher=The Student Room |date=2009-04-13 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of its students are women, 30% men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucas.com/instit/i/p26.html UCAS - uk map]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dean of the Institute is [[Andrew Hussey]]. Former directors include [[Francis Scarfe]] (1959â1978) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldpoetry.com/oauthor/show/Francis_Scarfe |title=Francis Scarfe at Old Poetry |publisher=Oldpoetry.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harley Granville Barker]] (1937â1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclop&amp;aelig;dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/241928/Harley-Granville-Barker#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&amp;title=Harley%20Granville-Barker%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Harley Granville-Barker (British author and producer) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1946-08-31 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Former students include the artist [[FranÃ§oise Gilot]]  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francoisegilot.com/section.php?sect=vitae |title=Francoise Gilot Archives |publisher=Francoisegilot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Picasso]]'s partner between 1944 and 1953 and author of the bestselling ''Life with Picasso''&lt;ref&gt;FranÃ§oise Gilot, ''Life with Picasso'', [[Random House]], Trade Paperback, 352 pages. May 1989. ISBN 0-385-26186-1
&lt;/ref&gt;. The BBC newsreader [[Fiona Bruce]] also studied for a year at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspirationalspeakers.co.uk/index.php/profile/fiona_bruce |title=Fiona Bruce |publisher=Inspirational Speakers |date= |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
