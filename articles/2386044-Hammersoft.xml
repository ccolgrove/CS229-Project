==History==
George Lucas Adamson, a Greek chemist from [[Athens]], founded the Adamson School of Industrial Chemistry on June 20, 1932 to train young men and women in practical industrial chemistry. It started as a one-classroom school that evolved into the Adamson School of Industrial Chemistry and Engineering on February 19, 1936. Its application for university status was approved by the Secretary of Public Instruction on February 5, 1941 and thereafter it has been known as Adamson University.

Shortly after the opening, George Adamson invited his cousin Alexander Athos Adamson to work in the school. Alexander Adamson joined the administration on July 15, 1932, serving at various times as Vice-President, Treasurer and Registrar. In 1934, Alexander's brother, George Athos Adamson, came to work in the school, becoming Dean of the College of Engineering of the university.

Evdoxia Savaides Adamson, wife of Fabio Lucas Adamson, started working and teaching in the university in 1939, then served as Dean of the College of Education and of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Sofia Adamson, George Athos Adamson's wife, taught in the College of Education after arriving in 1939 and briefly served as Directress of the Junior Normal College.

With the exception of George Athos and Sofia, who left after the [[Second World War]], all the members of the Adamson family remained working in the university until its turnover to the Vincentian Fathers and Brothers of the Congregation of the Mission in 1964. George Lucas Adamson served as President from the beginning until 1967, for a total of 35 years including a three-year holdover stint.

Before finally settling on its permanent home along San Marcelino Street in 1946 after the war, the school stayed in three different locations: Sta. Cruz (1932â1933), San Miguel (1933â1939) and Intramuros (1939â1941). In San Marcelino, the university expanded with the acquisition of the Meralco building in 1968 and the St. Theresa's College-Manila campus in 1977, both just across the street.


The transfer of ownership in 1964 incorporated the university into the Adamson-Ozanam Educational Institutions, Inc. It also led to its transition from a secular to a [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] institution, with the Vincentians holding top administrative posts and becoming majority members of the Board of Trustees. St. Vincent de Paul, founder of the C.M., was declared university patron saint and the motto &quot;Veritas in Caritate&quot; (Truth in Charity) was adopted.

Although Adamson University was founded as a secular school, when the [[Congregation of the Mission|Vincentian Fathers]] took over, they introduced religious programs to place it in line with the ideals of Catholic education.  A theology department was opened and campus ministry was strengthened, Masses were held daily, religious icons and celebrations were introduced on the University campus.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamson.edu.ph/about/main.shtm|title=About|publisher=adamson.edu.ph}} {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime minister Leandro I. MontaÃ±ana, C.M., a Spanish Vincentian, was the second President, but the first under the Vincentian (C.M.) administration. He served in that capacity until 1985 when Fr. Rolando S. Dela Goza, C.M., the first Filipino President, took the office and held it until 1994. Next came Fr. Jimmy Belita, C.M., university President until 2003 who in turn was succeeded by the current President Fr. Gregorio L. BaÃ±aga, Jr., C.M.

While remaining best known for its Chemistry and Engineering programs, Adamson University gradually added Architecture, Sciences, Pharmacy, Business, Education, Liberal Arts, Law, Graduate, Basic Education, and Theology courses. In the 1990s, it registered its highest enrollment figure ever: 21,994 students.

Adamson University celebrated its diamond jubilee on February 5â11, 2007 during which occasion it was also declared a Historic Site by the [[National Historical Institute]].

===Grading System===
====Performance-Based Evaluation====
A âFailâ policy is strictly observed, except on output-based subjects (e.g. thesis or its equivalent, and internship), where âNo gradeâ is given. A student would only earn credits for the subject if he passed both the lecture and laboratory components. The student is required to re-enroll both the lecture and laboratory if he/she failed either of the components. Due to inherent differences in the course requirements of different subjects in the various programs, the parameters used for the evaluation of students' performance and its corresponding weight are based on the course objectives as stipulated in the syllabus. The course requirements and its corresponding weight distribution are consensuses among the faculty handling the same subject or should be decided upon by an individual faculty who is the only one handling the subject. In either case the course requirements and its corresponding weight distribution is verified and confirmed by the dean/chair. Grades in the examinations, quizzes, and other requirements are computed as the percentage of raw scores and shall not be transmuted. The passing grade is 70%. The course requirements, its breakdown, and the computation of grade are provided for to the students by their respective professors at the start of the semester.
