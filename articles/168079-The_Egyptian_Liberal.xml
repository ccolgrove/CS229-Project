The '''2010 FIFA World Cup''' was the 19th [[FIFA World Cup]], the world championship for [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national]] [[association football]] teams. It took place in [[South Africa]] from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2010 FIFA World Cup|bidding process]] for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations; in 2004, the international football federation, [[FIFA]], selected South Africa over [[Egypt]] and [[Morocco]] to become the first African nation to host the finals.

The matches were played in [[#Venues|ten stadiums]] in nine host cities around the country, with the final played at the [[FNB Stadium|Soccer City]] stadium in South Africa's largest city, [[Johannesburg]]. Thirty-two teams were selected for participation via a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification|worldwide qualification tournament]] that began in August 2007. In the [[#Group stage|first round]] of the tournament finals, the teams competed in [[round-robin]] groups of four teams for points, with the top two teams in each group proceeding. These sixteen teams advanced to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]], where three rounds of play decided which teams would participate in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|final]].

In the final, [[Spain national football team|Spain]], the [[UEFA Euro 2008|European champions]], defeated third-time finalists [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] 1â0 [[after extra time]], with [[AndrÃ©s Iniesta]]'s goal in the 116th minute giving Spain their first world title, the first time that a European nation has won the tournament outside its home continent. Host nation [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]], [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] world champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and 2006 runners-up [[France national football team|France]] were all eliminated in the first round of the tournament. It was the first time that the hosts were eliminated in the first round.

==Host selection==
{{Main|FIFA World Cup hosts#2010 FIFA World Cup}}
[[File:Watching South Africa &amp; Mexico match at World Cup 2010-06-11 in Soweto 7.jpg|thumb|People watching the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, with [[vuvuzela]]s.]]
Africa was chosen as the host for the 2010 World Cup as part of a short-lived policy, abandoned in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://za.mg.co.za/article/2007-10-29-fifa-end-world-cup-rotation-policy|title=FIFA end World Cup Rotation|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian Online|date=29 October 2007 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to rotate the event among football confederations. Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: [[Egypt]], [[Morocco]], [[South Africa]] and a joint bid from [[Libya]] and [[Tunisia]].

Following the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process. The committee also decided not to consider Libya's solo bid as it no longer met all the stipulations laid down in the official ''List of Requirements''.

The winning bid was announced by FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]] at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in [[ZÃ¼rich]]; in the first round of voting South Africa received 14 votes, Morocco received 10 votes and Egypt no votes. South Africa, which had narrowly [[2006 FIFA World Cup#Host selection|failed to win the right to host the 2006 event]], was thus awarded the right to host the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/news/newsid=25395.html |title=Host nation of 2010 FIFA World Cup â South Africa|date=15 May 2004 |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=8 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2006 and 2007, rumours circulated in various news sources that the 2010 World Cup could be moved to another country.&lt;ref name=&quot;harding&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Luke |last=Harding |title=Doubt over South Africa 2010 |date=12 June 2006 |work=The Guardian |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/worldcup2006/story/0,,1818166,00.html |accessdate=29 August 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jermaine |last=Craig |title=Fifa denies SA may lose 2010 World Cup |date=3 July 2006 |publisher=[[The Star (South Africa)|The Star]] |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=19&amp;art_id=vn20060703014312923C258638&amp;set_id= |accessdate=30 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Beckenbauer]], Horst R.

==Qualification==
{{Main|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification}}
The qualification draw for the 2010 World Cup was held in [[Durban]] on 25 November 2007. As the host nation, [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] qualified automatically for the tournament. As happened in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|previous tournament]], the defending champions were not given an automatic berth, and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] had to participate in qualification. With a pool of entrants comprising 204 of the 208 [[List of men's national association football teams|FIFA national teams]] at the time, the 2010 World Cup shares with the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] the record for most competing nations in a sporting event.

Some controversies took place during the qualifications. In the second leg of the [[France vs Republic of Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup play-off|play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland]], French captain [[Thierry Henry]], unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread controversy and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the [[Football Association of Ireland]] to replay the match,&lt;ref name=FIFA20Nov09FIFAStatementOnFAIRequest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1137489.html |title=FIFA statement on FAI request |publisher=FIFA |date=20 November 2009|accessdate=20 November 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lQk0CY2L |archivedate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant.&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09BlatterApologisesOverComments&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5hMVC1s6Pr6WoHBrceHOFXYf4HZRw |title=Blatter apologises over comments |publisher=Press Association |date=2 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lkd3iCqc |archivedate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IrishTimes02Dec09FAISetsRecordStraight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sports/soccer/2009/1202/1224259931744.html |title=FAI tries to set record straight |work=Irish Times |date=2 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lkeAwkE8 |archivedate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South African tournament.&lt;ref name=UKPA02Dec09FIFARejectExtraRefs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5jO_FwfnIayPK8z-g_2K2KxWTfpPA |title=FIFA reject extra referees proposal |publisher=Press Association |date=2 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lkKZdcQw |archivedate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the subject of fair play, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:
{{quote|I appeal to all the players and coaches to observe this fair play. In 2010 we want to prove that football is more than just kicking a ball but has social and cultural value&amp;nbsp;... So we ask the players 'please observe fair play' so they will be an example to the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=BBCSport02Dec09FIFAToInvestigateHenry&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/8391388.stm |title=Fifa to investigate Thierry Henry handball |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2 December 2009|accessdate=3 December 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lkK6UowW |archivedate=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 2010 tournament was the first World Cup not to feature any team making its debut appearance (Slovakia had not previously appeared under that name, but is considered by FIFA to be a continuation of the Czechoslovakia team that last played in the 1990 tournament). North Korea qualified for the first time since 1966; Honduras and New Zealand were both making their first appearances since 1982, and Algeria were at the Finals for the first time since the 1986 competition.

==Preparations==
[[File:TelkomLukasRandTower.JPG|thumb|upright|The Lukasrand Tower in [[Pretoria]] sporting a football in anticipation of the World Cup]]
Five new stadiums were built for the tournament, and five of the existing venues were upgraded. Construction costs were expected to be [[South African rand|R]]8.4&amp;nbsp;billion (just over [[United States dollar|US$]]1&amp;nbsp;billion or â¬950&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=SA faces R8.4bn stadium bill | date=1 October 2006 | work=[[News24]] | url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/Soccer/0,,2-9-840_2006517,00.html | accessdate=13 October 2006 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061022131341/http://www.news24.com/News24/Sport/Soccer/0,,2-9-840_2006517,00.html| archivedate = October 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa also improved its [[public transport]] infrastructure within the host cities, including Johannesburg's [[Gautrain]] and other metro systems, and major road networks were improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joburg pursues bus rapid transit system in bid to ease gridlock by 2010 |url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article.php?a_id=119725 |work=Engineering News |publisher=Creamer Media |date=2 November 2007 |accessdate=2 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, [[Danny Jordaan]], the president of the 2010 World Cup organising committee, reported that all stadiums for the tournament were on schedule to be completed within six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7966169.stm |title=SA 2010 venues 'ready by October' |date=26 March 2009 |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=26 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country implemented special measures to ensure the safety and security of spectators in accordance with standard FIFA requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa Special Measures Act, 2006 | work=Republic of South Africa, Minister of Sport and Recreation â Online Government Gazette No. 28593 | date=10 March 2006 | url=http://www.info.gov.za/gazette/bills/2006/b13-06.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=13 October 2006| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061103065105/http://www.info.gov.za/gazette/bills/2006/b13-06.pdf| archivedate = November 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a temporary restriction of flight operation in the airspace surrounding the stadiums.&lt;ref name=&quot;sacaa-45-2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.za/resource%20center/AIC'S/45-2.pdf|title=Additional Aviation Coordination and Security measures during the 2010 World Cup|date=7 May 2009|publisher=[[South African Civil Aviation Authority]]|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a ceremony to mark 100 days before the event, FIFA president Sepp Blatter praised the readiness of the country for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.africareview.com/News/SA%20marks%20100%20days%20to%20World%20Cup/-/825442/872036/-/fcqxfuz/-/index.html |title=SA marks 100 days to World Cup |date=2 March 2010 |work=Africa Review |accessdate=14 March 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction strike===
On 8 July 2009, 70,000 construction workers&lt;ref&gt;BBC and SABC report 70,000 while the AP, quoting the South African Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, says 11,000&lt;/ref&gt; who were working on the new stadiums walked off their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=659780&amp;sec=world&amp;cc=5901|title=World Cup construction workers strike in SAfrica|date=8 July 2009|work=ESPN Soccernet|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the workers receive [[South African rand|R]]2500 per month (about [[Pound sterling|Â£]]192, [[Euro|â¬]]224 or US$313), but the unions alleged that some workers were grossly underpaid. A spokesperson for the [[National Union of Mineworkers (South Africa)|National Union of Mineworkers]] said to the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] that the &quot;no work no pay&quot; strike would go on until FIFA assessed penalties on the organisers. Other unions threatened to strike into 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/portal/site/SABCNews/menuitem.5c4f8fe7ee929f602ea12ea1674daeb9/?vgnextoid=4159f0381c552210VgnVCM10000077d4ea9bRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default&amp;channelPath=Sport%20%3E%3E%20Soccer|title=NUM members working on 2010 stadiums ready for massive strike action|date=7 July 2009|work=SABC News|publisher=SABC|accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8140433.stm|title=S Africa strike hits stadium work |date=8 July 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was swiftly resolved and workers were back at work within a week of it starting. There were no further strikes and all stadiums and construction projects were completed in time for the kick off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa2010.gov.za/en/node/2429|title=2010 construction strike ends|date=15 July 2009|work=Sapa|publisher=South African Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prize money==
The total prize money on offer for the tournament was confirmed by FIFA as [[United States dollar|US$]]420&amp;nbsp;million (including payments of US$40&amp;nbsp;million to domestic clubs), a 60 percent increase on the 2006 tournament.&lt;ref name=FIFA03Dec09RecordPrizeMoney&gt;{{cite news |title=FIFA Executive Committee holds historic meeting in Robben Island |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/releases/newsid=1143269.html |work=FIFA.com |publisher=FIFA |date=3 December 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the tournament, each of the 32 entrants received US$1&amp;nbsp;million for preparation costs. Once at the tournament, the prize money was distributed as follows:&lt;ref name=FIFA03Dec09RecordPrizeMoney/&gt;
* US$8&amp;nbsp;million â To each team exiting after the [[#Group stage|group stage]] (16 teams)
* US$9&amp;nbsp;million â To each team exiting after the [[#Round of 16|round of 16]] (8 teams)
* US$14&amp;nbsp;million â To each team exiting after the [[#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] (4 teams)
* US$18&amp;nbsp;million â [[#Third-place play-off|Fourth placed team]]
* US$20&amp;nbsp;million â [[#Third-place play-off|Third placed team]]
* US$24&amp;nbsp;million â [[#Final|Runner up]]
* US$30&amp;nbsp;million â [[#Final|Winner]]

In a first for the World Cup, FIFA made payments to the domestic clubs of the players representing their national teams at the tournament. This saw a total of US$40&amp;nbsp;million paid to domestic clubs. This was the result of an agreement reached in 2008 between FIFA and European clubs to disband the [[G-14]] group and drop their claims for compensation dating back to 2005 over the financial cost of injuries sustained to their players while on international duty, such as that from Belgian club [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi S.C.]] for injury to Morocco's [[Abdelmajid Oulmers]] in a friendly game in 2004, and from English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for an injury to England's [[Michael Owen]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Journal1Mar2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Fifa are adding insult to injury |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/nufc/newcastle-united-news/2007/03/01/fifa-are-adding-insult-to-injury-61634-18690847/ |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC06Sep2005G14FightFifa&gt;{{cite news |title=G14 starts legal fight with Fifa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/4219244.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=31 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC15Feb2008G14Disbanded&gt;{{cite news |title=G-14 football group is disbanded |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7247791.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=31 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==

In 2005, the organisers released a provisional list of thirteen venues to be used for the World Cup: [[Bloemfontein]], [[Cape Town]], [[Durban]], [[Johannesburg]] (two venues), [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[Klerksdorp]], [[Nelspruit]], [[Orkney, North West|Orkney]], [[Polokwane]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Pretoria]], and [[Rustenburg, North West|Rustenburg]]. This was narrowed down to the ten venues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bbs.keyhole.com/ubb/showthreaded.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=EarthSports&amp;Number=944685&amp;fpart=&amp;PHPSESSID= |title=2010 Soccer World Cup Fan Parks &amp; 2010 Host Cities|publisher=Google Earth Community|date=29 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; that were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006.

==Final draw==
{{See also|2010 FIFA World Cup seeding}}
The FIFA Organising Committee approved the procedure for the final draw on 2 December 2009. The seeding was based on the October 2009 FIFA World Ranking and seven squads joined hosts South Africa as seeded teams for the final draw. No two teams from the same confederation were to be drawn in the same group, except allowing a maximum of two European teams in a group.&lt;ref name=&quot;draw&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/finaldraw/01/14/22/91/fwc2010_final_draw_procedure_en_021209.pdf |publisher=[[FIFA]] |title=2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa Final Draw Procedure |year=2009 |accessdate=4 December 2009

The group draw was staged in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, on 4 December 2009 at the [[Cape Town International Convention Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/Pages/CapeTowntohost2010finaldraw2.aspx |title=Cape Town to host 2010 final draw |accessdate=6 February 2009 |date=29 May 2008 |publisher=City of Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was presented by South African actress [[Charlize Theron]], assisted by FIFA Secretary General [[JÃ©rÃ´me Valcke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Theron, Beckham and Gebrselassie to star at the Final Draw on 4 December |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/finaldraw/news/newsid=1142022/ |work=FIFA.com |publisher=FIFA |date=2 December 2009 |accessdate=15 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The balls were drawn by [[England national football team|English]] football star [[David Beckham]] and African sporting figures [[Haile Gebrselassie]], [[John Smit]], [[Makhaya Ntini]], [[Matthew Booth (soccer)|Matthew Booth]] and Simphiwe Dludlu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Draw ignites FIFA World Cup fever |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/finaldraw/news/newsid=1143584.html |work=FIFA.com |publisher=FIFA |date=4 December 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referees==
{{Main|2010 FIFA World Cup officials|2010 FIFA World Cup controversies#Refereeing}}
FIFA's Referees' Committee selected 29 [[referee (association football)|referees]] through its Refereeing Assistance Programme to officiate at the World Cup: four from the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], three from the [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]], six from [[CONMEBOL]], four from [[CONCACAF]], two from the [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]] and ten from [[UEFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Referees | work=FIFA.com | publisher=FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association | accessdate=11 February 2010 | url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/referees/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; English referee Howard Webb was chosen to referee the final, making him the first person to referee both the [[UEFA Champions League]] final and the World Cup final in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8802425.stm |title=Englishman Howard Webb to referee final |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Squads==
[[File:FIFA World Cup 2010 Brazil North Korea 3.jpg|thumb|The Brazilian and North Korean teams before their group stage match]]
{{details|2010 FIFA World Cup squads}}
As with the [[2006 FIFA World Cup squads|2006 tournament]], each team's squad for the 2010 World Cup consisted of 23 players. Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player [[2010 FIFA World Cup squads|squad]] by 1 June 2010. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/competitions/WorldCup/67/17/65/671765_DOWNLOAD.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=[[UEFA]] |title=2010 FIFA World Cup Regulations |author=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 736 players participating in the tournament, over half played their club football in five European domestic leagues; those in England (117 players), Germany (84), Italy (80), Spain (59) and France (46).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theglobalherald.com/fifa-world-cup-2010-where-the-players-are-based/4339/ |title=Where the players are based |work=The Global Herald |date=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English, German and Italian squads were made up of entirely home based players, while only Nigeria had no players from clubs in their own league. In all, players from 52 national leagues entered the tournament. [[FC Barcelona]] of Spain was the club contributing the most players to the tournament, with 13 players of their side travelling, 7 with the Spanish team, while another 7 clubs contributed 10 players or more.

In another first for South Africa 2010, one squad included three siblings. [[Jerry Palacios|Jerry]], [[Johnny Palacios|Johnny]] and [[Wilson Palacios]] made history thanks to their inclusion in Hondurasâ 23-man list.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa 2010 in numbers&quot;&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/news/newsid=1273493/index.html |title=South Africa 2010 in numbers |publisher=FIFA |work=FIFA.com |date=13&amp;nbsp;July 2010 |accessdate=18&amp;nbsp;July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group stage==
The first round, or group stage, saw the thirty-two teams divided into eight groups of four teams. Each group was a [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] of six games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams finishing first and second in each group qualified for the Round of 16.

The South American teams performed strongly, with all five advancing to the knockout stages (four as group winners). The overall performance of African teams on the first occasion that the continent hosted the event was judged disappointing by observers such as Cameroon great [[Roger Milla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccer365.com/world_cup/story_9710195414.php |title=Milla Disappointed With Africa |date=9 July 2010 |publisher=Soccer365.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the six African nations only three won any matches, and only one (Ghana) progressed out of the first round.

Only six out of thirteen [[UEFA]] teams progressed to the last sixteen, a record low since the round of 16 was adopted in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa 2010 in numbers&quot;/&gt; Both of the finalists from the preceding tournament, France and Italy, were eliminated in the initial stage of the competition, the first time this has happened at a World Cup.&lt;!-- This claim needs to be worded carefully: note than in both 1934 and 1966 one of the outgoing finalists was eliminated in the 1st stage and the other did not compete at all --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/06/24/italy.slovakia.new.zealand.paraguay/index.html |title=Champions Italy crash out of World Cup |publisher=CNN |date=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] ended the tournament as the only undefeated team after drawing their three group matches, but they finished behind [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] and were eliminated.

==Knockout stage==
{{Main|2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage}}
''All times listed are [[South African Standard Time]] ([[UTC+02]])''

The [[single-elimination tournament|knockout stage]] comprised the sixteen teams that advanced from the group stage of the tournament. There were four rounds of matches, with each round eliminating half of the teams entering that round. The successive rounds were the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. There was also a play-off to decide third and fourth place. For each game in the knockout stage, any draw at 90 minutes was followed by thirty minutes of [[extra time]]; if scores were still level, there was a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] to determine who progressed to the next round.&lt;ref name=regulations&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/56/42/69/fifawcsouthafrica2010inhalt%5fe.pdf |format=PDF |title=Regulations 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa |publisher=FIFA |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{2010 FIFA World Cup knockout stage bracket}}

===Round of 16===
In this round, each group winner (A-H) was paired against the runner-up from another group.
* South American teams again performed strongly in the round of 16, with four teams advancing to the quarter-finals including [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] who defeated fellow South American team [[Chile national football team|Chile]].
* England's 4â1 loss to Germany was their worst ever defeat at a World Cup finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/10430974.stm |title=England's World Cup exit dominates papers |publisher=BBC News |date=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-world-cup-jones-20100628,0,2663952.column |title=There's no disputing that England deserved its loss to Germany |work=Los Angeles Times |date=27 June 2010 | first=Grahame L. | last=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ghana defeated the United States to become the third African team to reach the last eight (after [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] and [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]), and the only African team to have achieved both a top 8 finish and a separate top 16 finish (in 2006).
* Paraguay and Ghana reached the quarter-finals for the first time.

The round was marked by some [[List of 2010 FIFA World Cup controversies|controversial referees' decisions]], including:
* A disallowed goal by [[Germany v England (2010)|England in their 4â1 loss against Germany]], where the shot by [[Frank Lampard]] was seen to cross the goal line when shown on television broadcast replays.
* An allowed goal by [[Argentina v Mexico (2010)|Argentina in their 3â1 win over Mexico]], where Argentine striker [[Carlos TÃ©vez]] was seen to be offside when shown on television broadcast replays, which were shown inside the stadium shortly after the incident.

FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] took the unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the decisions that went against them, saying &quot;Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Blatter_apology&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8771294.stm |title=World Cup 2010: Blatter apologises for disallowed goal |publisher=BBC Sport |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=29 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying &quot;We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.&quot;&lt;ref name=Blatter_apology/&gt; Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary [[Jerome Valcke]] said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]].&lt;ref name=Blatter_apology/&gt;

===Quarter-finals===
The three quarter-finals between European and South American teams all resulted in wins for Europeans. Germany had a 4â0 victory over Argentina, and the Netherlands came from behind to beat Brazil 2â1, handing the Brazilians their first loss in a World Cup match held outside Europe (other than in a penalty shootout) since [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1950]].&lt;ref&gt;In the [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]], [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] World Cups, Brazil finished as undefeated champions.  In the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]] competition, Brazil was eliminated by Argentina on goal difference without losing a match.  In the [[1986 World Cup|1986]] competition, Brazil was eliminated in a penalty shootout with France, without having lost a match.&lt;/ref&gt; Spain reached the final four for the first time since 1950 after a 1â0 win over Paraguay. Uruguay, the only South American team to reach the semi-finals, overcame Ghana in a [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shoot-out]] after a 1â1 draw in which Ghana missed a penalty at the end of extra time.

The final was held on 11 July 2010 at [[FNB Stadium|Soccer City]], [[Johannesburg]]. [[Spain national football team|Spain]] defeated the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] 1â0, with an extra time goal by [[AndrÃ©s Iniesta]]. Iniesta scored the latest winning goal in a FIFA World Cup final (116').&lt;ref name=&quot;FIFA&quot;&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/news/newsid=1273020/index.html |title=Roja, Oranje provide numbers aplenty |publisher=FIFA |work=FIFA.com |date=12&amp;nbsp;July 2010 |accessdate=18&amp;nbsp;July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The win gave Spain their first World Cup title, becoming the eighth team to win it. This made them the first new winner without home advantage since Brazil in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Brazil won their first World Cup in Sweden. England, Argentina, and France each won it for the first time on home soil - {{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/index.html |title=Previous FIFA World Cups |publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first team to win the global showpiece having lost their opening game.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa 2010 in numbers&quot;/&gt;

A large number of fouls were committed in the final match. Referee [[Howard Webb]] handed out fourteen yellow cards, more than doubling the previous record for this fixture, set when Argentina and West Germany shared six cards in 1986,&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa 2010 in numbers&quot;/&gt; and [[John Heitinga]] of the Netherlands was sent off for receiving a second yellow card. The Netherlands had chances to score, most notably in the 60th minute when Arjen Robben was released by [[Wesley Sneijder]] to be one-on-one with Spain's goalkeeper [[Iker Casillas]], only for Casillas to save the shot with an outstretched leg. For Spain, [[Sergio Ramos]] missed a free header from a corner kick when he was unmarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/matches/match_64/default.stm?textpanel=report|title=Netherlands 0â1 Spain|date=11 July 2010|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iniesta finally broke the deadlock in extra time, scoring a side-footed shot from a pass by [[Cesc Fabregas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iXcHDxnCEyTeb4JLg1sf2BGNprDQ|title=Spain beat Holland 1â0 to win World Cup|date=11 July 2010|work=AFP|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This result marked the first time that two different teams from the same continent had become world champions in succession, and saw Europe reaching ten World Cup titles, surpassing South America's nine titles. Spain became the first team since West Germany in 1974 to win the World Cup as [[UEFA European Football Championship|European champions]]. The result also marked the first time that a European nation had won a World Cup Finals that was not hosted on European soil.

A closing ceremony was held before the final, featuring singer [[Shakira]]. Afterwards, the former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] made a brief appearance on the pitch, wheeled in by a motorcart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/africa/10589713.stm|title=Mandela attends World Cup closing ceremony|date=11 July 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goalscorers===
:''For the full list of goalscorers, see [[2010 FIFA World Cup statistics#Goalscorers|2010 FIFA World Cup Goalscorers]]''

South African winger [[Siphiwe Tshabalala]] was the first player to score a goal in the competition, in their [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group A#South Africa vs Mexico|1â1 draw against Mexico]], the opening game of the tournament. Danish defender [[Daniel Agger]] was credited with the first [[own goal]] of the tournament, in his side's [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group E#Netherlands vs Denmark|2â0 loss to the Netherlands]]. Argentine striker [[Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n]] was the only player to score a [[hat-trick]] in the tournament, in Argentina's [[2010 FIFA World Cup Group B#Argentina vs Korea Republic|4â1 win over South Korea]]. It was the 49th [[List of FIFA World Cup hat-tricks|World Cup hat-trick]] in the history of the tournament.

Spain had the fewest goals scored in the World Cup tournament for a champion, with eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa 2010 in numbers&quot;/&gt; The previous record low was 11, by [[Brazil]] in [[1994 World Cup|1994]], England in [[1966 World Cup|1966]] and Italy in [[1934 World Cup|1934]]. Spain had the fewest goal scorers for a champion as well (3).&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa 2010 in numbers&quot;/&gt; They also had the fewest goals conceded for a champion (2), equal with Italy (2006) and France (1998). Spain's victory marked the first time that a team won the World Cup without conceding a goal in the knockout stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIFA&quot;/&gt;

The four top scorers in the tournament had five goals each. All of the four top scorers also came from the teams that finished in the top four, Spain, Netherlands, Germany, and Uruguay. The [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] went to [[Thomas MÃ¼ller]] of Germany who had three [[assist (football)|assist]]s, compared to one for the three others. The Silver Boot went to [[David Villa]] of Spain, who played a total of 635 minutes, and the Bronze Boot to [[Wesley Sneijder]] of the Netherlands, who played 652 minutes.

Only 145 goals were scored at South Africa 2010, the lowest of any FIFA World Cup since the tournament switched to a 64-game format. This continued a downward trend since the first 64-game finals were held 12 years earlier, with 171 goals at France 1998, 161 at Korea/Japan 2002 and 147 at Germany 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;South Africa 2010 in numbers&quot;/&gt;

His name came from &quot;ZA&quot; (the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|international abbreviation]] for South Africa) and the term ''kumi'', which means &quot;ten&quot; in various [[African languages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Leopard takes World Cup spotlight |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/7630454.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mascot's colours reflected those of the host nation's playing strip â yellow and green.

The match [[Association football (ball)|ball]] for the 2010 World Cup, manufactured by [[Adidas]], is named the ''Jabulani'', which means ''&quot;bringing joy to everyone&quot;'' in [[Zulu language|Zulu]]. It is the eleventh World Cup match ball made by the German sports equipment maker; it features eleven colours, representing each player of a team on the pitch and the eleven official [[languages of South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/meet-jabulani-2010-world-cup-match-ball/ |title=Meet Jabulani: 2010 World Cup Match Ball |work=The New York Times |date=4 December 2009 |accessdate=4 December 2009 | first=Jack | last=Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shine2010.co.za/Community/blogs/goodnews/archive/2009/12/04/official-2010-world-cup-match-ball-jabulani-launched.aspx|title=2010 World Cup Jabulani Adidas ball |accessdate=6 December 2009|publisher=Shine2010|date=4 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A special match ball with gold panels, called the ''Jo'bulani'', was used at the final in [[Johannesburg]].

The ball is constructed using a new design, consisting of eight thermally bonded, three-dimensional panels. These are spherically moulded from [[ethylene-vinyl acetate]] (EVA) and [[thermoplastic polyurethanes]] (TPU). The surface of the ball is textured with grooves, a technology developed by Adidas called GripnGroove&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2010/01/13/jabulani-world-cup-soccer-ball-review/|title=Jabulani Official World Cup Ball Review |accessdate=12 January 2010|publisher=Soccer Cleats 101|date=13 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is intended to improve the ball's aerodynamics. The design has received considerable academic input, being developed in partnership with researchers from [[Loughborough University]], United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/service/publicity/news-releases/2009/169_adidas-jabulani.html|title=adidas Jabulani Official Match Ball of the 2010 FIFA World Cup |accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The balls are made in China, using latex bladders made in India, thermoplastic polyurethane-elastomer from Taiwan, ethylene vinyl acetate, isotropic polyester/cotton fabric, and glue and ink from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dishtracking.com/newsdetails.php?news_id=OTYw |title=adidas unveils 'Jabulani' the Official Match Ball of the 2010 FIFA World CupTM|publisher=Dishtracking.com |year=2009 |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some football stars have complained about the new ball, arguing that its movements are difficult to predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/796261/ce/uk/?cc=5901&amp;ver=us|title=Designer defends World Cup ball|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=14 June 2010|accessdate= 14 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian goalie [[JÃºlio CÃ©sar Soares EspÃ­ndola|JÃºlio CÃ©sar]] compared it to a &quot;supermarket&quot; ball that favored strikers and worked against goalkeepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesoccerroom.com/?p=9013 |title=Julio Cesar calls Jabulani âsupermarket ballâ |publisher=The Soccer Room|date=28 May 2010|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentinian coach [[Diego Maradona]] said &quot;We won't see any long passes in this World Cup because the ball doesn't fly straight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/blogs/2010-world-cup-blog/World-Cup-diary-Diego-Maradona-blames-Jabulani-ball-for-Lionel-Messi-s-lack-of-skills-by-David-McDonnell-article492747.html |title=Jabulani ball is reason Messi is struggling, says Maradona |publisher=Mirror Football |first=David |last=McDonell |date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of Adidas-sponsored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/page/SponsorsAndPartners/0,,10268~1325861,00.html |title=adidas|publisher=Chelsea FC |date= |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccer.fanhouse.com/2010/05/31/players-dislike-adidas-world-cup-ball/ |title=Players Dislike Adidas World Cup Ball |publisher=Soccer FanHouse |date= |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoffside.com/world-football/adidas-xi-vs-nike-xi-which-brand-has-the-best-football-team.html |title=Adidas XI vs Nike XI: Which Brand Has the Best Football Team? |publisher=The Offside |date= |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricardo-kaka.com/information_endorsements.php |title=Ricardo Kaka Endorsements |publisher=Ricardo Kaka |date=26 October 2009|accessdate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; players have responded favourably to the ball.

The trespasser was then released before he could be handed over to the Police. The [[Football Association|English FA]] lodged a formal complaint with FIFA and demanded that security be increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/7840048/World-Cup-2010-Police-hunt-angry-fan-who-entered-England-dressing-room.html |title=World Cup 2010: Police hunt angry fan who entered England dressing room |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=19 June 2010|accessdate=19 June 2010 | location=London | first1=Martin | last1=Evans | first2=Gordon | last2=Rayner | first3=Aislinn | last3=Laing}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the trespasser turned out to be a British journalist, this incident was orchestrated and involved the cooperation of a number of individuals. &quot;The police strongly believe that the motive was to put the World Cup security in a bad light and possibly to profit from this act.&quot; Cele told reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2890/world-cup-2010/2010/06/29/2000956/british-journalist-arrested-regarding-england-dressing-room|title=British journalist arrested regarding England dressing room intruder at World Cup 2010 |work=Goal.com |publisher=goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reporter was later identified as Simon Wright, a British journalist who works for the Sunday Mirror in the UK. Many South Africans had reasons to believe it was part of a plot.
====Resettlement and eviction====
[[File:2009Blikkiesdorp.JPG|thumb|Police patrol Blikkiesdorp, a settlement for the evicted.]]

As with many 'hallmark events' throughout the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldpress.org/Americas/3064.cfm|title=Hallmark Events and Evictions|publisher=[[Worldpress]]|date=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2010 FIFA World Cup has been connected to [[eviction]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Smith|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/12/south-africa-world-cup-2010 |title=World Cup 2010: Football brings defining moment for South Africa|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 12 June 2009 |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Cowell |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/29/world/africa/29iht-letter.html?_r=1 |title=World Cup Whose Meaning Goes Beyond Soccer |work=New York Times |date=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/economic-cleansing-in-bbcs-world-cup-backyard-1925037.html |title='Economic cleansing' in BBC's World Cup backyard, Stewart Maclean|work=The Independent |location=UK|date=22 March 2010|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mohammed |last=Allie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/africa/10205455.stm |title=South Africans fight eviction for World Cup car park |publisher=BBC News |date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/04/kicked-out-for-the-cup.html |title=Kicked Out for the Cup? |first=Christopher |last=Worth |work=Newsweek |date=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which many claim are meant to 'beautify the city', impress visiting tourists, and hide shackdwellers. On 14 May 2009, the Durban-based shack-dwellers' movement [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]] took the KwaZulu-Natal government to court over their controversial [[Elimination and Prevention of Re-Emergence of Slums Act]], meant to eliminate slums in South Africa and put homeless shackdwellers in transit camps in time for the 2010 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.oneworld.net/article/362921-slums-act-will-displace-thousands-south-africa|title=Shack Dwellers Fight Demolition in S.

Another prominent controversy surrounding preparations for the World Cup is the [[N2 Gateway]] housing project in [[Cape Town]], which plans to remove over 20,000 residents from the [[Joe Slovo Informal Settlement]] along the busy N2 Freeway and build rental flats and bond-houses in its place in time for the 2010 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/e23g510k121u3g77/|title=The Reverse Side of the Medal: About the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the Beautification of the N2 in Cape Town |publisher=Springer Link|work=Urban Forum|date=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs, international human rights organisations, and the [[Anti-Eviction Campaign]] have publicly criticised the conditions in Blikkiesdorp and said that the camp has been used to accommodate poor families evicted to make way for the 2010 World Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/01/south-africa-world-cup-blikkiesdorp| title=Life in 'Tin Can Town' for the South Africans evicted ahead of World Cup|work=The Guardian | location=London | first=David | last=Smith | date=1 April 2010 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pambazuka.org/en/category/socialmovements/59332| title=Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions ask City to reconsider Symphony Way's eviction to Blikkiesdorp| publisher=Pambazuka News|date =8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2009Dec03/0,4675,SOCWCupCapeTownCleanup,00.html| title=Homeless S. Africans complain ahead of World Cup| agency=Associated Press| work=Fox News| last=Brooks| first=Courtney| date=3 December 2009| accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However some have argued that evictions are ordinarily common in South Africa and that in the lead up to the tournament many evictions were erreonously ascribed to the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/wcarticleshow/6040153.cms Soccer World Cup will not boost South Africa's economy], Rukmini Shrinivasan, ''Times of India'', 12 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
Some groups experienced complications in regards to scheduled sporting events, advertising, or broadcasting, as FIFA attempted to maximise control of media rights during the Cup. Affected parties included an international [[rugby union]] [[Test match (rugby union)|Test match]], a South African airline, and some TV networks, all of whom were involved in various legal struggles with World Cup organisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

During the tournament, group ticket-holders who did not utilise all their allotted tickets led to some early-round matches having as many as 11,000 unoccupied seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://af.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFJOE65E0NJ20100615?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=sportsNews&amp;sp=true |title=Empty seats concern FIFA but attendances stay high |publisher=Reuters Africa |date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the event did help to boost the image of South Africa, financially it turned out to be a major disappointment.&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news |first=Rupert |last=Neate |title=South Africa recoups just a tenth of the Â£3bn cost of staging World Cup 2010 |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/leisure/8192484/South-Africa-recoups-just-a-tenth-of-the-3bn-cost-of-staging-World-Cup-2010.html |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=10 December 2010 |accessdate=11 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction costs for venues and infrastructure amounted to Â£3&amp;nbsp;billion (â¬3.6&amp;nbsp;billion), and the government expected that increased tourism would help to offset these costs to the amount of Â£570&amp;nbsp;million (â¬680&amp;nbsp;million). However, only Â£323&amp;nbsp;million (â¬385&amp;nbsp;million) were actually taken in as 309,000 foreign fans came to South Africa, well below the expected number of 450,000.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;

Local vendors were prohibited from selling food and merchandise within a 1.5&amp;nbsp;kilometre radius of any stadium hosting a World Cup match. For a vendor to operate within the radius, a registration fee of [[South African rand|R]]60,000 (approximately to US$7,888 or â¬6,200), had to be paid to [[FIFA]]. This fee was out of most local vendors' reach, as they are simple one-man-operated vendors. This prevented international visitors from experiencing local South African food. Some local vendors felt cheated out of an opportunity for financial gain and spreading South African culture, in favour of multinational corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csr-asia.com/upload/cover/307059103144.pdf |title=Corporate Social Responsibility in Asia |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA president Sepp Blatter declared the event &quot;a huge financial success for everybody, for Africa, for South Africa and for FIFA,&quot; with revenue to FIFA of Â£2.24&amp;nbsp;billion (â¬2&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/628/other-top-stories/2011/03/04/2378109/sepp-blatter-2010-world-cup-a-stunning-financial-success-for |title=Sepp Blatter: 2010 World Cup A Stunning Financial Success For South Africa &amp; FIFA |publisher=Goal.com |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality===
In a December 2010 ''Quality Progress'', FIFA President Blatter rated South Africa's organisational efforts a nine out of 10 scale, declaring that South Africa could be considered a plan B for all future competitions. The South African Quality Institute (SAQI) assisted in facility construction, event promotion, and organisations. The main issue listed in the article was transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Paul. &quot;Shining on the World Stage&quot;. ''Quality Progress''. December 2010. pp. 56-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
===Broadcasting===
{{Main|2010 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights}}

The 2010 FIFA World Cup was expected to be the most-watched television event in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;UT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1223134/index.html |title=Beaming 2010 to the world |work=FIFA.com |publisher=FIFA |date=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of broadcasters, representing about 70 countries, transmitted the Cup to a TV audience that FIFA officials expect to exceed a cumulative 26&amp;nbsp;billion people, an average of approximately 400&amp;nbsp;million viewers per match.&lt;!-- see Discussion page for why cumulative viewers exceeds the population of the planet! --&gt; FIFA estimated that around 700 million viewers would watch the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|World Cup final]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fifaestimate&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=700 million to watch World Cup Final |work=The Spy Report |publisher=Media Spy |date=12 July 2010 |url=http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/07/12/700-million-to-watch-world-cup-final/ |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New forms of digital media have also allowed viewers to watch coverage through alternative means. &quot;With games airing live on cell phones and computers, the World Cup will get more online coverage than any major sporting event yet,&quot; said Jake Coyle of the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coyle&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jake |last=Coyle |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gBU5fp-9OUOfP3BIvX0lz-A8CvtAD9G7QKR00 |title=World Cup coverage expands on the Web, cell phones |agency=Associated Press |date=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The following should grow to include other countries. Upon expansion it should probably become a subsection --&gt;
In the United States, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[ESPN]] and [[ESPN2]] averaged a 2.1 rating, 2,288,000 households and 3,261,000 viewers for the 64 World Cup games. The rating was up 31 percent from a 1.6 in 2006, while households increased 32 percent from 1,735,000 and viewers rose from 2,316,000. The increases had been higher while the US remained in the tournament. Through the first 50 games, the rating was up 48 percent, households increased 54 percent and viewers rose 60 percent. [[Univision]] averaged 2,624,000 viewers for the tournament, up 17 percent, and 1,625,000 households, an increase of 11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/soccer/world-cup-2010/07/12/ratings.ap/index.html |title=World Cup final sets ratings record |accessdate=12 July 2010 |date=12 July 2010 |agency=Associated Press}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; An executive of the [[Nielsen Company]], a leading audience research firm in the US, described the aggregate numbers for both networks' coverage of the USA-Ghana match as &quot;phenomenal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/sports/soccer/29sandomir.html |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |title=World Cup Ratings Certify a TV Winner |accessdate=19 July 2010 |date=29 June 2010 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live World Cup streaming on [[ESPN3|ESPN3.com]] pulled in some of the largest audiences in history, as 7.4 million unique viewers tuned in for matches. In total, ESPN3.com generated 942 million minutes of viewing or more than two hours per unique viewer. All 64 live matches were viewed by an average of 114,000 persons per minute. Most impressive were the numbers for the Spain-Germany semifinal, which was viewed by 355,000 people per minute, making it ESPN3.comâs largest average audience ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsvideo.org/main/blog/2010/07/15/world-cup-2010-espn3-com-espn-digital-draw-in-massive-audiences/ |title=World Cup 2010: ESPN3.com, ESPN Digital Draw in Massive Audiences |accessdate=19 July 2010 |date=15 July 2010| work=Sports Video Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sony technology was used to film the tournament. 25 of the matches were captured using 3D cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8394191.stm |title=World Cup games to be filmed in 3D |publisher=BBC News |date=3 December 2009|accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footage was captured in 3D through Sony's proprietary multi-image MPE-200 processors, housed in specially designed 3D outside broadcast trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bhavna |last=Mistry |url=http://www.avinteractive.co.uk/news/995672/Sony-providing-HDC-1500-cameras-FIFA-World-Cup |title=Sony providing HDC-1500 cameras for FIFA World Cup |publisher=AV Interactive |date=8 April 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supplied its flagship HDC-1500 cameras as well as its new HDC-P1 unit, a compact, point-of-view (POV)-type camera with 3, 2/3-inch CCD sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/cat-broadcastcameras/cat-pov/product-HDCP1|title=Sony Product Detail Page HDCP1|publisher=Sony|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3D games were produced for FIFA by Host Broadcast Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/450462-Sony_Preps_for_World_Cup_3D.php |title=Sony Preps for World Cup 3D |publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
