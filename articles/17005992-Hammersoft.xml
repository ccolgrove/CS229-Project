{{Main|Vehicle registration plates of Georgia (U.S. state)}}
The state of '''[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]''' offers many specialty or '''optional [[license plate]]s''', most at an extra cost to motorists. Plates are also issued for non-passenger vehicles, such as [[truck]]s, [[school bus]]es, and governmental vehicles.

==December 2003 to present==
{{Update|date=January 2009}}
The state streamlined the ever-growing number of limited-issuance plates by instituting two-letter prefixes for almost all types other than standard passenger plates.

For most types, the serial format progresses after the two-letter prefixes in the following sequence: 0, 00, 000, 0000, 000A, 00A0, 0A00, 00AA, 0AAA, and 0AA0.

Many of these plate types first appeared on the www.GEORGIA.gov base in December 2003 or later, but beginning in the first quarter of 2007, some types began transitioning to the GEORGIA.gov base, with nearly all types having made the transition by the first quarter of 2008. On the new base, the county sticker box and remaining (right) year sticker box were removed.
