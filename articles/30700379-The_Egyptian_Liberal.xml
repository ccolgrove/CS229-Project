'''International reactions to the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]]''' refer to external responses to the events that took place in Egypt between 25 January and 10 February 2011, as well as some of the events after the collapse of the government of [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]], such as Mubarak's trial. The reactions have generally been either measured or supportive of the [[Egyptian people]], with most governments and organisations calling for non-violent responses on both sides and peaceful moves towards reform. Whilst the protesters called for Mubarak to step down immediately,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Al-Shalchi, Hadeel; El Deeb, Sarah|title=Mubarak Says He Will Not Seek Re-Election|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/1/massive-crowds-across-egypt-demand-mubaraks-ouster/?page=|accessdate=2 February 2011|publisher=''[[Associated Press]]'' (via ''[[The Washington Times]]'')|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; most foreign governments stopped short of this demand, at least during the early phases of the protests, due to [[realpolitik]] concerns about the consequences of a power vacuum on the stability of [[Egypt]] specifically and to the wider [[Middle East]] as a whole. Some Middle Eastern leaders expressed support for Mubarak. Meanwhile many governments issued [[travel advisory|travel advisories]] and evacuated their citizens from the country.

The protests captured worldwide attention in part due to the increasing use of [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], and other [[social media|social-media]] platforms, which empowered activists and onlookers to communicate, coordinate, and document the events as they occur. Many countries experienced their own solidarity protests in support of the Egyptians. As the levels of meta-publicity increased, the Egyptian government stepped up [[Domestic responses to the 2011 Egyptian protests#Media censorship and circumvention|efforts to limit Internet access]], especially to social media. In response there has been [[hacktivism]], with global groups attempting to provide alternative communication methods for the Egyptians.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Observers compared it to the toppling of Russian domains in 1989, but there are important differences. Crucially, no [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] exists among the great powers that support the Arab dictators. Rather, Washington and its allies keep to the well-established principle that democracy is acceptable only insofar as it conforms to strategic and economic objectives: fine in enemy territory (up to a point), but not in our backyard, please, unless properly tamed. One 1989 comparison has some validity: Romania, where Washington maintained its support for [[Nicolae Ceausescu]], the most vicious of the east European dictators, until the allegiance became untenable. Then Washington hailed his overthrow while the past was erased. That is a standard pattern: [[Ferdinand Marcos]], [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]], [[Chun Doo-hwan]], [[Suharto]] and many other useful gangsters. It may be under way in the case of Hosni Mubarak, along with routine efforts to try to ensure a successor regime will not veer far from the approved path.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Tariq Ali]] said the protests would be a &quot;rude awakening for all those who imagined that the despots of the Arab world could be kept in place provided they continued to serve the needs of the West.&quot; He said that &quot;while Western establishments lull themselves to sleep with fairy tales, ordinary citizens, who are defeated and demoralised, mull their revenge.&quot; He added that &quot;If Tunisia was a tremor, the Egyptian uprising has become an earthquake that is spreading throughout the region. The generals in Cairo are still refusing to disperse the crowds with tanks and bullets. A full-scale Tiananmen Square option, which Mubarak and his friends would have appreciated, becomes difficult in these conditions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bloombergreactions&quot;/&gt;

[[Ralph Nader]] said that Vice-President Omar Suleiman appeared to be making the decisions, if only to give the impression that Mubarak was relenting and would be willing to remain as a figurehead president until his term ends later in the year. He believes that Mubarak was very alert to what would be needed to maintain the loyalties of the police, the intelligence agencies, the security forces and the army and that when is forced out tens of thousands of those on his payroll would lose their patronage. Nader stated that &quot;the government is striving to wait out the protesters, whose daily supplies and energies are being sapped by the overwhelming force arrayed against them to intimidate, weaken and keep their numbers down not just in [Tahrir] Square but also in other cities like Alexandria and Suez.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nader |first=Ralph |url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/02/08-5 |title=Time for Democracy in Egypt |publisher=Common Dreams |date= |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
