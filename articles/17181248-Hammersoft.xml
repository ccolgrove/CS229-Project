'''Daniel''' ({{Hebrew Name|×Ö¸Ö¼× Ö´×ÖµÖ¼××|Daniyyel|DÄniyyÃªl}}, meaning &quot;God is my Judge&quot;) is the [[protagonist]] in the ''[[Book of Daniel]]'' of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. In the narrative, when Daniel was a young man, he was taken into [[Babylonian captivity]] where he was educated in [[Chaldea]]n thought. However, he never converted to [[Neo-Babylon]]ian ways. By ''Divine Wisdom'' from his God, [[YHVH]], he interpreted dreams and visions of kings, thus becoming a prominent figure in the court of Babylon. Eventually, he had [[apocalypse|apocalyptic visions]] of his own that have been interpreted as the ''[[Four monarchies]]''. Some of the most famous tales of Daniel are: [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]], [[The writing on the wall]] and [[Daniel in the lions' den]].

==Narrative of Daniel==

===Induction into Babylon===
[[File:Daniel refuse kingsfood.jpg|thumb|200px|Daniel refusing to eat at the King's table, early 1900s Bible illustration]]

In the third year of the reign of [[Jehoiakim]] (BC 606), Daniel and his friends [[Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah]] were among the young Jewish nobility carried off to [[Babylon]]. The four were chosen for their intellect and beauty to be trained as advisors to the Babylonian court,({{Bibleref|Daniel|1|}}) Daniel was given the name ''Belteshazzar'', i.e., ''prince of Bel'', or ''Bel protect the king!''(not to be confused with the neo-Babylonian king, Belshazzar). [[Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah]] were given the Babylonian names, [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]], respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael 2009&quot;&gt;Coogan, Michael. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar===

{{Main|Daniel 2}}
{{also|Nebuchadnezzar II#Portrayal in the books of Daniel and Jeremiah}}
{{also|Book of Daniel#Nebuchadnezzar or Nabonidus}}

In the narrative of Daniel chapter 2, it is the second year of the reign of [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] and the king is distressed by his dreams.&lt;sup&gt;[v.1]&lt;/sup&gt; Thus he summons his interpreters,&lt;sup&gt;[v.2]&lt;/sup&gt; however, they are unable to relay or interpret the dreams.&lt;sup&gt;[v.10-11]&lt;/sup&gt; The King acts in fury and demands the execution of all the wise men in Babylon.&lt;sup&gt;[v.12]&lt;/sup&gt; When Daniel discovers the King's executive order, he requests from the ''captain of the guard'', [[Arioch]], to see the King.&lt;sup&gt;[v.13-16]&lt;/sup&gt; Daniel prays for Godâs mercy to receive a revelation from the Kingâs dream.&lt;sup&gt;[v.15-18]&lt;/sup&gt; God then reveals the mystery to Daniel in a vision that night.&lt;sup&gt;[v.19]&lt;/sup&gt; Daniel praises his God with a [[doxology]].&lt;sup&gt;[v.20-23]&lt;/sup&gt; After meeting with Arioch again, Daniel is granted access to the king&lt;sup&gt;[v.24-30]&lt;/sup&gt; and relays the description of the dream,&lt;sup&gt;[v.31-36]&lt;/sup&gt; followed by its interpretation.&lt;sup&gt;[v.37-45]&lt;/sup&gt; With Daniel's successful interpretation of the dream, the king expresses homage,&lt;sup&gt;[v.46]&lt;/sup&gt; followed by his own doxology that affirms that Daniel's ''God is God of gods'' for revealing this ''mystery'' of his dream.&lt;sup&gt;[v.47]&lt;/sup&gt; Daniel is then promoted as chief governor over the whole province of Babylon.&lt;sup&gt;[v.48]&lt;/sup&gt; At Danielâs request, his companions are also promoted, thus they remain at the kingâs court.&lt;sup&gt;[v.49]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=John J.|title=Daniel : with an introduction to apocalyptic literature|year=1984|publisher=W.B. Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=0802800203|edition=Reprinted.|pages=47â49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daniel and Belshazzar===

{{Main|The writing on the wall}}
{{also|Belshazzar#Belshazzar in literature}}

In Daniel's later years, after the alarm and consternation of the night of [[Belshazzar]]'s impious feast (in which Belshazzar and his concubines drank wine out of the royal Jewish ceremonial goblets of the Temple), Daniel was called in at the suggestion of the queen-mother to interpret the mysterious [[handwriting on the wall]]. For successfully reading the cryptic handwriting by an angel of God, Daniel was rewarded by the Babylonians with a purple robe and elevation to the rank of &quot;third ruler&quot; of the kingdom.  It is believed that the place of &quot;second ruler&quot; was held by Belshazzar as associated with his father, [[Nabonidus]], on the throne ({{Bibleref|Daniel|5:16|JPS}}), though nowhere in the book of Daniel is Nabonidus mentioned by name and according to the book of Daniel Nebuchadnezzar was the father of Belshazzar. Nabonidus left Babylon in his son Belshazzar's care when he fled because of his refusal to accept the role of Marduk as the prime deity. The Hebrew word translated in the book of Daniel as &quot;son&quot; can mean any descendant.  Belshazzar was actually the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. Daniel interpreted the handwriting, and &quot;in that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain&quot;.

===Daniel and Darius the Mede===

{{Main|Daniel in the lions' den}}
{{also|Book of Daniel#Historicity of Darius the Mede}}

After the Persian conquest of Babylon, Daniel held the office of the first of the &quot;three presidents&quot; of the empire under the reign of [[Darius the Mede]], and was thus practically at the head of state affairs, with the ability to influence the prospects of the captive Jews ({{Bibleref|Daniel|9|JPS}}), whom he had at last the happiness of seeing restored to their own land; although he did not return with them, but remained still in Babylon.

Daniel's fidelity to God exposed him to persecution by jealous rivals within the king's administration. The fact that he had just interpreted the emperors' dream had resulted in his promotion and that of his companions. Being favored by the King, Darius the Mede, he was untouchable. His companions were vulnerable to the accusation that had them thrown into the furnace for refusing  to worship the Babylonian King, Nebuchadnezzar as a god; but they were miraculously saved, and Daniel would years later be cast [[Daniel in the lions' den|into a den of lions]] (for continuing to practice his faith in YHWH), but was miraculously delivered; after which Darius issued a decree enjoining reverence for &quot;the God of Daniel&quot; ({{Bibleref|Daniel|6:26|JPS}}). He &quot;prospered in the reign of [[Darius the Great|Darius]], and in the reign of [[Cyrus the Great]],&quot; whom he probably greatly influenced in the decree which put an end to the Jewish Captivity (BC 536).

===Daniel's visions===

{{Main|Four monarchies}}
{{further|[[Daniel 7]], [[Daniel 8]], and [[Daniel 11]]}}
{{also|Prophecy of seventy weeks}}

Daniel's ministry as a prophet began late in life. Whereas his early exploits were a matter of common knowledge within his community, these same events, with his pious reputation, serve as the basis for his prophetic ministry. The recognition for his prophetic message is that of other prophets like [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]] and [[Ezekiel]] whose backgrounds are the basis for their revelations.

From Chapter 7 to the end of the book of Daniel, an [[apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] vision is being described, supposedly from the perspective of Daniel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael 2009&quot;/&gt; This marks a change in the narrative from Daniel interpreting to messengers of God interpreting for Daniel. Daniel dreams of four beasts that come out of the sea: a lion with eagles wings, a bear with three tusks, a leopard with four wings and four heads, and a beast with iron teeth, ten horns and one little horn and human eyes.({{Bibleref|Daniel|7:4-8|JPS}}) These beasts are all present at a convening of the divine counsel. Presiding over the counsel is the Ancient of Days, which may, in fact, be the Israelite God.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael 2009&quot;/&gt; The Ancient One proceeds to put to death the beast with the one little horn. ({{Bibleref|Daniel|7:9-11|JPS}}) Daniel also describes the fates of the other beasts saying that while their dominion was taken away, their lives were prolonged. ({{Bibleref|Daniel|7:12|JPS}}) This introduction leads into a series of dreams and visions where these events are expressed in greater detail. 

Scholars argue that each of these beasts represent an emperor or kingdom that ruled over the Israelites. The first being [[Babylonian Empire|Babylon]], then [[Median Empire|Media]], then [[Persian Empire|Persia]], and finally the [[Greeks]]. The horns of the last beast may be symbolic of the rulers that replaced [[Alexander the Great]] upon his death, culminating with the little horn, or [[Antiochus IV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael 2009&quot;/&gt; There are additional details in the text that allude to Antiochus IV, including some form of desecration to the temple ({{Bibleref|Daniel|11:31|JPS}}) and persecution ({{Bibleref|Daniel|11:23|JPS}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael 2009&quot;/&gt; The final message of the second half of Daniel is that God will deliver the people from oppression, the latest of which is Antiochus IV.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan, Michael 2009&quot;/&gt;

===Daniel's final days===
The time and circumstances of Daniel's death have not been recorded. However, tradition maintains that Daniel was still alive in the third year of Cyrus according to the [[Tanakh]] ({{Bibleref|Daniel|10:1|JPS}}). He would have been almost 100 years old at that point, having been brought to Babylon when he was in his teens, more than 80 years previously. Many{{Who|date=February 2010}} posit that he possibly died at [[Susa]] in [[Iran]]. Tradition holds that his tomb is located in Susa at a site known as '''Shush-e Daniyal'''.  Other locations have been claimed as the site of his burial, including [[Daniel's Tomb]] in Kirkuk, Iraq, as well as Babylon, Egypt, Tarsus and, notably, [[Samarkand]], which claims a tomb of Daniel (see &quot;The Ruins of Afrasiab&quot; in the [[Samarkand]] article), with some traditions suggesting that his remains were removed, perhaps by [[Tamerlane]], from Susa to Samarkand (see, for instance, [http://isfsp.org/sages/ben5.html Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela], section 153).

==References to Daniel==
[[File:Tomb of Daniel 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tomb of Daniel at [[Susa]], [[Iran]].]]

===Book of Ezekiel===
The prophet [[Ezekiel]], with whom Daniel was a contemporary, describes a Daniel as a &quot;pattern of righteousness&quot; in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] 14:14, 20 and &quot;wisdom&quot; (28:3).&lt;ref name=&quot;eas&quot;&gt;{{Eastons}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Book of Daniel, the name is spelled with a middle letter suggesting the ''i'' of that name â but this letter is not included in Ezekiel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezekiel%2014:13-14:19&amp;version=31#fen-NIV-20746a NIV footnote on Ezekiel 14:14]&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that the reference there may be to another person, possibly the &quot;[[Danel]]&quot; (&quot;Judgement of God&quot;) known from Caananite [[Ugaritic]] literature (such as the [[Anat|Epic of Aqhat and Anat]]), whose reputation for wisdom and righteousness had made him legendary. (Vowel-points were not added to the consonantal Hebrew text before well into the Common Era, and the scribes may then have slipped in a vowel-point for &quot;i&quot; as a middle syllable.)

===Bel and the Dragon===
In the [[Deuterocanonical]] portion of Daniel known as [[Bel and the Dragon]], the prophet [[Habakkuk]] is miraculously transported by an angel to take a meal to Daniel while he is in the lions' den. In response, Daniel prays, &quot;Thou hast remembered me, O God; neither hast thou forsaken them that seek Thee and love Thee&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=&quot;Saying Grace&quot; Historically Considered and Numerous Forms of Grace:Taken from Ancient and Modern Sources; With Appendices|last=Dixon|first=Henry Lancelot|year=1903|publisher=James Parker and Co.|location=Oxford and London|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CVsNAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=daniel+prays+%22thou+hast+remembered+me+o+god+neither+hast+thou+forsaken+them+that+seek+thee+and+love+thee%22|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six tombs of Daniel==
{{Main|Tomb of Daniel}}
There are six different locations claiming to be the site of the tomb of the biblical figure Daniel: [[Babylon]], [[Kirkuk]] and [[Muqdadiyah]] in [[Iraq]], [[Susa]] and [[Malamir, Iran|Malamir]] in [[Iran]], and [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]].

==Religious perspectives==

===Rabbinic literature===
{{Main|Daniel in rabbinic literature}}

According to Rabbinical tradition, Daniel was of royal descent; and his fate, together with that of his three friends, [[Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah]], was foretold by the prophet [[Isaiah]] to King [[Hezekiah]] in these words, &quot;and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon&quot;.&lt;sup&gt;{{Bibleverse||Isaiah|39:7|HE}}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;([[Talmud]] tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 93b; [[Pirke de Rabbi Eliezer]] lii)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JE&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=31&amp;letter=D JewishEncyclopedia.com - DANIEL&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to this view, Daniel and his friends were [[eunuchs]], and were consequently able to prove the groundlessness of charges of immorality brought against them, which had almost caused their death at the hands of the king.&lt;ref name=JE /&gt;

===Eastern Orthodox commemorations===
On the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical calendar]], the feast days celebrating St. Daniel the Prophet together with the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|Three Young Men]], falls on [[December 17 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|December 17]] (during the [[Nativity Fast]]), on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers&lt;ref&gt;Sergei Bulgakov, ''Manual for Church Servers'', 2nd ed. (Kharkov, 1900) pp. 453-5.  December 11-17: Sunday of the Holy Forefathers Translation: Archpriest Eugene D. Tarris&lt;/ref&gt; (the Sunday which falls between 11 and 17 December), and on the Sunday before Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Bulgakov, ''''Manual for Church Servers'''', pp. 461-2. December 18-24: Sunday before the Nativity of Christ of the Holy Fathers&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel's prophesy regarding the stone which smashed the idol ({{Bibleverse||Daniel|2:34-35|HE}}) is often used in Orthodox hymns as a metaphor for the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]]: the &quot;stone cut out&quot; being symbolic of the [[Logos]] (Christ), and the fact that it was cut &quot;without hands&quot; being symbolic of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]]. Thus the hymns will refer to the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary) as the &quot;uncut mountain&quot;

In the West, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] commemorates Daniel on July 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is commemorated as a prophet in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] together with the Three Young Men ([[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego]]), on December 17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chi.lcms.org/history/tih1217.htm Today in History - December 17&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is commemorated as a prophet in the [[Coptic Church]] on the 23rd day of the Coptic month of Baramhat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copticchurch.net/classes/synex.php?sa=1&amp;month=7&amp;day=23&amp;btn=View The Departure of the great prophet Daniel]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic views===
{{Main|Islamic view of Daniel}}

[[Muslim]]s traditionally consider '''Daniel''' ([[Arabic]]: Ø¯Ø§ÙÙØ§Ù, ''Danyal'') as an [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]], alongside the other [[major prophet]]s of the [[Old Testament]]. Although Daniel is not mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], there are accounts of Daniel's life which feature in later Muslim literature. There are debates, however, that go on about Daniel's time of preaching and some Muslims believe that he was not a prophet but a saintly man. Daniel is listed as a [[prophet]] in all major versions of ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Ibn Kathir]]'s ''[[Stories of the Prophets (Ibn Kathir)|Stories of the Prophets]]'': &quot;The Story of Daniel&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Muslim]]s conquered [[Alexandria]] in 641 C.E, a [[mosque]] was immediately built dedicated to Daniel.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''Daniel''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Muslim literature====
[[Muslim]] [[exegesis]], including [[Tabari]]'s ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' narrates that Daniel was carried off to [[Babylon]] after [[Nebuchadnezzar]]'s attack on [[Jerusalem]]. It goes onto state that there he was thrown into the den of the lions, but was later rescued. In one such account, Daniel is aided by [[Jeremiah]], who comes to [[Babylon]] to help Daniel in the lions den.&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of the Prophets'', ''The Story of Daniel'', Part 1. Food in the Lions Den&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[apocryphal]] ''[[Bel and the Dragon]]'', however, there is a very similar tale which states that the [[Hebrew]] [[prophet]] [[Habbakuk]] was miraculously transported to the den of the lions, to give a meal to Daniel. 

All sources, [[Islamic Golden Age|classical]] and [[modern]], describe Daniel as a saintly and spiritual man. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], in his Qur'anic commentary says:
{{Quote|Daniel was a righteous man of princely lineage and lived about 506-538 B.C. He was carried off to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, the Assyrian, but was still living when Assyria was overthrown by the Medes and Persians. In spite of the &quot;captivity&quot; of the Jews, Daniel enjoyed the highest offices of state at Babylon, but he was ever true to Jerusalem. His enemies (under the Persian monarch) got a penal law passed against any one who &quot;asked a petition of any god or man for 30 days&quot; except the Persian King. But Daniel continued true to Jerusalem. &quot;His windows being open in his chambers towards Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.&quot;|[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]|''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]]|''[[The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary]]'', '''Note.'''150&lt;/ref&gt;}}
