{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2011}}
His first book, ''[[No god but God]]'' (Random House, 2005), has been translated into thirteen languages, was short-listed for the Guardian (UK) First Book Award, and nominated for a PEN USA award for research Non-Fiction. In ''[[No god but God]]'', Aslan challenges the &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; mentality that has distorted our view of Islam and explains this critical faith in all its complexity, beauty, and compassion. Aslan begins with a vivid account of the social and religious milieu from which the Prophet Muhammad arose. The revelations that Muhammad received in Mecca and Medina, and which were recorded in the Quran, became the foundation of a radically egalitarian community, the likes of which had never been seen before.  [[No god but God]]''  also examines how, in the shadow of European colonialism, Muslims developed conflicting strategies to reconcile traditional Islamic values with the social and political realities of the modern world. With the emergence of the Islamic State in the 20th century, this contest over the future of Islam has become a passionate, sometimes violent battle between those who seek to enforce a rigid and archaic legal code on society and those who struggle to harmonize the teachings of the Prophet with contemporary ideals of democracy and human rights. According to Dr. Reza Aslan, we are now living in the era of &quot;the Islamic Reformation.&quot; [[No god but God]]'' is a persuasive and elegantly written account of the origins, evolution, and future of Islam.

On April 20, 2009, his book ''How to Win a Cosmic War: God, Globalization, and the End of the War on Terror'' (Random House, 2009) was released. ''How to Win a Cosmic War'' provides both an in-depth study of the ideology behind [[al-Qaeda]], the [[Taliban]], and like-minded militants throughout the Muslim world, and an exploration of the tradition of religious violence found in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Surveying the global scene from Israel to Iraq and from New York to the Netherlands, Aslan argues that religion is a stronger force today than it has been in a century. At a time when religion and politics are increasingly sharing the same vocabulary and functioning in the same sphere, Aslan writes that we must strip this ideological conflict of its religious connotations and address the actual grievances that fuel the Jihadist movement. How to Win a Cosmic War was the subject of an interview by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show. Aslan discussed its themesâthe intrinsic irrationality of fundamentalist Islamic objectives, the dangers posed by the lack of understanding of Jihadists by the American military and the Christian evangelical movement, and the utility of free elections and participatory democracy in containing the spread of Jihadist movements (a goal for which he complimented George W. Bush). The book was published in paperback as Beyond Fundamentalism: Confronting Religious Extremism in the Age of Globalization.

''Tablet &amp; Pen: Literary Landscapes From the Modern Middle East'', edited by Dr. Reza Aslan, is a 600-plus page anthology that takes a broad view of 20th century Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Pakistani history and culture through the filter of the written word. This book uses the work of 69 writers to make a strong case for the power of fiction, poetry and essays to connect us at the level of the heart. &quot;If the purpose of literature is to provide a window into other worlds,&quot; Dr. Aslan notes, &quot;then the individual pieces collected in this anthology are mere porthole glimpses into the kaleidoscopic world of the modern Middle East. Dr. Aslan brings a historian's vision to ''Tablet &amp; Pen'', arranging the collection in three chronological sections, and geographically within them. Dr. Aslan's goal is to create &quot;not an anthology to be tasted in disparate bits but rather a single sustained narrative to be consumed as a whole.&quot;
As well as books, Aslan has written numerous articles, commentaries (for broadcast, print and new media), and book reviews internationally. He often appears on broadcast media radio and television, including many documentaries on Islam and the Muslim Prophet Muhammad. He tours in U.S. and internationally giving talks and has written many press articles.

==Quotes==
{{Copy to Wikiquote|section=yes}}

*&quot;I believe we are living in the time of the Islamic reformation. In fact, I think we are living in the twilight of that reformation. For me, the word reform is defined by its inevitability. This process cannot be stopped; it can be slowed down for a time but reform is inevitable. It's an historic reformation taking place within Islam â it's adapting itself to the realities of the world around it. I think we'll see the same process we saw in the Christian reformation from doctrinal absolutism to doctrinal relativism; toward a truly indigenous Islamic enlightenment. And it's up to us as Muslims in the US to give voice to that for our brothers and sisters who don't have the voice or the same ability to speak out as we do.&quot;
*&quot;It is pluralismâthe peaceful coexistence and legal equality between different ethnic, religious or political ideologiesâthat defines democracy, not secularism.&quot;
*&quot;The veil is seen as a symbol of Islam but like all symbols, it's meaningless unless interpreted. The veil is as much a symbol of oppression of women as it is an expression of Muslim femininity. The strangeness of this is that if you go to a country where the veil is either mandatory or there is a lot of pressure to wear it, you'll find the vast majority of women are against it. But, if you go to a country like Turkey where the veil is outlawed in much of the public realm â in the latest polls, 70 percent of the Muslim women want to remove that law.&quot;
*&quot;Iraq should look to Israel for a model that combines democracy and religious belief.&quot;
*&quot;Despite the apartheid state that has resulted from over half a century of bloody territorial conflicts with its neighboring Palestinian territories, few would deny that the state of Israel is a democracy. At the same time, Israel is a country founded upon an exclusivist Jewish moral framework, which offers all the world's Jews â regardless of their nationality â immediate citizenship, providing them with a host of benefits and privileges over its non-Jewish citizens. It is a country in which the Orthodox rabbinical courts have jurisdiction over all matters relating to Judaism (including who is a Jew); where religious schools (yeshivas) are subsidized by the state, and marriages are religious, rather than civil affairs (meaning no official will marry a Jew to a non-Jew); and the government is dominated by religious parties such as the ultra-Orthodox Shas, the Yahadut Hatorah, and of course the ruling Likud.&quot;
*&quot;If we don't figure out a way to strip these conflicts of their religious connotations, then we will never figure out a way to put an end to them. Because as long as these remain cosmic conflicts, they will go on for eternity.&quot;
*&quot;A lot of scholars, myself included, believe the future of Islam, especially Islamic democracy, rests in the Shia world. It's Iran and Iraq where the most exciting experiments are being carried out.&quot;
*&quot;Iraqâs 2,000-year-old Christian community is on the brink of extinction, its members targeted by al Qaeda attacks and fleeing abroad... This silence cannot stand. Americans of all faiths must band together and pressure the State Department to do something about the wanton murder of Iraqi Christians before it's too late and there are no more Christians in Iraq to protect. What is happening in Iraq is genocide, plain and simple. It must be stopped now.&quot;
*&quot;The fact of the matter is that Islam, like all religions, has been in a constant state of evolution for 1400 years. It has been constantly adapting to the spiritual, the cultural, the political, the social realities and the landscape in which it finds itself, which is why there is such a wide diversity of belief and practices within the Muslim world.&quot;
