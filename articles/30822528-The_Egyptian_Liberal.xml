The '''2011 Egyptian revolution''' ({{lang-ar|Ø«ÙØ±Ø© 25 ÙÙØ§ÙØ±}} ''thawret 25 yanÄyir'', Revolution of 25 January) took place following a popular uprising that began on Tuesday, 25 January 2011 and is still continuing as of December 2011. The uprising was mainly a campaign of non-violent [[civil resistance]], which featured a series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], marches, acts of [[civil disobedience]], and labour strikes. Millions of protesters from a variety of [[socio-economic]] and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of the regime of [[Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Despite being predominantly peaceful in nature, the revolution was not without violent clashes between security forces and protesters, with at least 846 people killed and 6,000 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/385140 |title=Ø´ÙØ­Ø©: ÙÙØ§ØªØ¨ Ø§ÙØµØ­Ø© ÙØ«ÙØª Ø³ÙÙØ· 840 Ø´ÙÙØ¯Ø§Ù Ø®ÙØ§Ù Ø«ÙØ±Ø© 25 ÙÙØ§ÙØ± |publisher=Almasry-alyoum.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14075493 |title=Egypt: Cairo's Tahrir Square fills with protesters |publisher=BBC |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising took place in [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], and in other cities in Egypt, following the [[Tunisian revolution]] that resulted in the overthrow of the long-time Tunisian president. On 11 February, following weeks of determined popular protest and pressure, Mubarak resigned from office.

Grievances of Egyptian protesters were focused on legal and political issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1473531/Q&amp;A--What-s-behind-the-unrest-|title=Q&amp;A: What's Behind the Unrest?|publisher=SBS|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[police brutality]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP-egyptbraces&quot;/&gt; [[Emergency law in Egypt|state of emergency]] laws,&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP-egyptbraces&quot; /&gt; lack of free elections and [[freedom of speech]],&lt;ref name=&quot;alarabiya-plans&quot; /&gt; uncontrollable corruption,&lt;ref name=&quot;alarabiya-plans&quot; /&gt; and economic issues including high unemployment,&lt;ref name=&quot;tna&quot;/&gt; [[food inflation|food price inflation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tna&quot; /&gt; and low [[minimum wage]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP-egyptbraces&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tna&quot; /&gt; The primary demands from protest organizers were the end of the [[Hosni Mubarak]] regime and the end of emergency law; freedom, justice, a responsive non-military government, and a say in the management of Egypt's resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/01/egyptian-activists-action-plan-translated/70388/|title=Egyptian Activists' Action Plan: Translated|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strikes by [[Trade unions in Egypt|labour unions]] added to the pressure on government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenddemocracy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=11792083&amp;Itemid=347 |title=Trade unions: the revolutionary social network at play in Egypt and Tunisia |publisher=Defenddemocracy.org |accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government imposed a [[curfew]] that protesters defied and that the police and military did not enforce. The presence of Egypt's [[Central Security Forces]] police, loyal to Mubarak, was gradually replaced by largely restrained military troops. In the absence of police, there was [[looting]] by gangs that opposition sources said were instigated by plainclothes police officers. In response, watch groups were organised by civilians to protect neighbourhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Fleishman|first=Jeffrey and Edmund Sanders (Los Angeles Times)|title=Unease in Egypt as police replaced by army, neighbors band against looters|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2014078461_egypt30.html|accessdate=1 February 2011|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Looting spreads in Egyptian cities|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011129175926266521.html|accessdate=1 February 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera English|date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hauslohner|first=Abigail|title=The Army's OK with the Protesters, for now|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2045124,00.html#ixzz1CfroWYuj|accessdate=1 February 2011|newspaper=Time.com|date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mubarak plays last card, the army; Police vanish|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2011/me_egypt0078_01_31.asp|accessdate=1 February 2011|newspaper=World Tribune (online)|date=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stirewalt|first=Chris|title=Egypt: From Police State to Military Rule|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/31/egypt-police-state-military-rule/|accessdate=1 February 2011|publisher=Fox News|date=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mubarak dissolved his government and appointed military figure and former head of the [[Egyptian General Intelligence Directorate]] [[Omar Suleiman]] as Vice-President in an attempt to quell dissent. Mubarak asked aviation minister and former chief of Egypt's Air Force, [[Ahmed Shafik]], to form a new government. [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] became a major figure of the opposition, with all major opposition groups supporting his role as a negotiator for some form of transitional unity government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Shadid|first1=Anthony|last2=Kirkpatrick|first2=David D.|title=Opposition Rallies to ElBaradei as Military Reinforces in Cairo|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/world/middleeast/31-egypt.html|accessdate=31 January 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to mounting pressure, Mubarak announced he would not seek re-election in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=El Deeb, Sarah; Al-Shalchi, Hadeel|title=Egypt Crowds Unmoved by Mubarak's Vow Not To Run|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=12815050|accessdate=1 February 2011|work=[[Associated Press]] (via ''[[ABC News]]'')|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inheritance of Power===
[[File:Gamal Mubarak.jpg|thumb|upright|Gamal Mubarak in 2006]]
	
{{main|Gamal Mubarak}}
	
Gamal Mubarak, the younger of Mubarak's two sons, began being groomed to be his father's successor as the next president of Egypt around the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Aziz, Muhammad Abdul and Hussein, Youssef (2002) &quot;The President, the Son, and the Military: Succession in Egypt&quot; ''Arab Studies Journal'' 9/10:&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;73â88&lt;/ref&gt; Gamal started receiving considerable attention in the Egyptian media, as there were no other apparent heirs to the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Bee, Jason (2008) [https://webspace.utexas.edu/jmb334/www/documents/article.ASJ.2008.pdf &quot;The Heir Apparency of Gamal Mubarak&quot;] ''Arab Studies Journal''&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;36â56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bashar al-Assad]]'s rise to power in [[Syria]] in June 2000, just hours after [[Hafez al-Assad]]'s death sparked a heated debate in the Egyptian press regarding the prospects for a similar scenario occurring in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;Sobelman, Daniel (2001) [http://www.meforum.org/27/gamal-mubarak-president-of-egypt &quot;Gamal Mubarak, President of Egypt?&quot;] ''Middle East Quarterly'' 8(2):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;31â40&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the years after [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|Mubarak's 2005 reelection]] several political groups (most in Egypt are unofficial) on both the left and the right, announced their sharp opposition to the inheritance of power. They demanded political change and asked for a fair election with more than one candidate. In 2006, with opposition rising, The Daily News Egypt reported on an online campaign initiative called the National Initiative against Power Inheritance which demanded Gamal reduce his power. The campaign stated, &quot;President Mubarak and his son constantly denied even the possibility of [succession]. However, in reality they did the opposite, including amending the constitution to make sure that Gamal will be the only unchallenged candidate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/egyptians-abroad-speak-out-against-inheritance-of-power.html | title=Egyptians abroad speak out against inheritance of power | date=3 October 2006&lt;!--, 1:01&amp;nbsp;pm --&gt;| accessdate=16 April 2011 | author=Al-A'sar, Marwa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the decade perception grew that Gamal would succeed his father. He wielded increasing power as NDP deputy secretary general, in addition to a post he held heading the party's policy committee. Analysts went so far as describing Mubarak's last decade in power as âthe age of Gamal Mubarak.â With Mubarakâs health declining and the leader refusing to appoint a vice-president, Gamal was considered by some to be Egypt's de-facto president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/9988/Egypt/Politics-/How-Gamal-brought-down-the-whole-Mubarak-house.aspx | title=How Gamal brought down the whole Mubarak house | publisher=Ahram Online | date=Friday 15 Apr 2011 | accessdate=16 April 2011 | author=Gamal Essam El-Din}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Gamal and Hosni Mubarak continued to deny that an inheritance would take place. There was talk, however, of Gamal being ''elected''; with Hosni Mubarak's presidential term set to expire in 2010 there was speculation Gamal would run as the NDP party's candidate in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/20/world/africa/20egypt.html | title=Mubarak's Son Proposes Nuclear Program |work=The New York Times | date=20 September 2006 | accessdate=16 April 2011 | author=Michael Slackman and Mona el-Naggar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the JanuaryâFebruary 2011 protest, Gamal Mubarak stated that he would not be running for the presidency in the 2011 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|title=Egypt unrest: Anti-Mubarak protesters fight back|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12357891|newspaper=British Broadcasting Company|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police brutality===
{{see|Law enforcement in Egypt}}

According to a report from the U.S. Embassy in Egypt, police brutality has been common and widespread in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/28/egypt-police-brutality-torture-wikileaks|title=US reported 'routine' police brutality in Egypt, WikiLeaks cables show|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=Friday 28 January 2011 15.23 GMT|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last five years, the Mubarak regime has denied the existence of torture or abuse carried out by the police. However, many claims by domestic and international groups provide evidence through cellphone videos or first-hand accounts of hundreds of cases of police abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=U.S. Embassy in Cairo|title=US embassy cables: Police brutality in Egypt|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/187359|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2009 Human Rights Report by the U.S. State Department, &quot;Domestic and international human rights groups reported that the Ministry of Interior (MOI) State Security Investigative Service (SSIS), police, and other government entities continued to employ torture to extract information or force confessions. The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights documented 30 cases of torture during the year 2009. In numerous trials defendants alleged that police tortured them during questioning. During the year activists and observers circulated some amateur cellphone videos documenting the alleged abuse of citizens by security officials. For example, on 8 February, a blogger posted a video of two police officers, identified by their first names and last initials, sodomizing a bound naked man named Ahmed Abdel Fattah Ali with a bottle. On 12 August, the same blogger posted two videos of alleged police torture of a man in a Port Said police station by the head of investigations, Mohammed Abu Ghazala. There was no indication that the government investigated either case.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Department of State|title=2009 Human Rights Report: Egypt|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136067.htm#|accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the January&amp;nbsp;â February 2011 protests, police brutality was high in response to the protests. Jack Shenker, a reporter for ''[[The Guardian]]'', was arrested during the mass protests in Cairo on 26 January 2011. He witnessed fellow Egyptian protesters being tortured, assaulted, and taken to undisclosed locations by police officers. Shenker and other detainees were released after one of his fellow detainees' well-known father, [[Ayman Nour]], covertly intervened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shenker|first=Jack|title=Bloody and Bruised: The Journalist Caught in Egypt Unrest|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/27/egypt-riot-security-force-action|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 January 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|title=Profile: Ayman Nour|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4558054.stm|newspaper=British Broadcasting Company|date=24 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile of Ayman Nour|url=http://egyptelections.carnegieendowment.org/2010/09/09/profile-of-ayman-nour|newspaper=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|date=9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption in government elections===

Accusations of corruption, coercion to not vote, and manipulation of the election results have occurred during many of the elections over the past 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=U.S. Department of State, Embassy of Egypt|title=Subject: Struggling to Address Police Brutality|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/187359|location=London |work=The Guardian |date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2005, Mubarak was the only candidate to run for the presidency, on a yes/no vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Democracy Reporting International and Egyptian Organization for Human Rights|title=Final Report: Assessment of the Electoral Framework in the Arab Republic of Egypt|url=http://www.democracy-reporting.org/downloads/reports/dri_egypt.pdf|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mubarak has won five consecutive presidential elections with a sweeping majority. Opposition groups and international election monitoring agencies have accused the elections of being rigged. These agencies have not been allowed to monitor the elections. The only opposing presidential candidate in recent Egyptian history, [[Ayman Nour]], was imprisoned before the 2005 elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharp|first=Jeremy|title=Egypt: Background and U.S. Relations|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33003.pdf|newspaper=Congressional Research Service|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a UN survey, voter turnout is extremely low (around 25%) because of the lack of trust in the corrupt representational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Democracy Reporting International and Egyptian Organization for Human Rights|title=Final Report: Assessment of the Electoral Framework in the Arab Republic of Egypt|url=http://www.democracy-reporting.org/downloads/reports/dri_egypt.pdf|newspaper=Congressional Research Service|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restrictions on free speech and press===

Even though the Egyptian constitution provides for the universal freedom of speech (Egypt Constitution, Article 47 â 49),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Constitution of the Arab Republic of Egypt|url=http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/laws/constitution/default.aspx|accessdate=7 April 2011|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government has frequently sanctioned home raids, torture, arrests, and fining of bloggers and reporters that criticize the government in any way. Under the current state of emergency laws, the government can censor anything if it is considered a threat to âpublic safety and national securityâ. If any reporter or blogger violates this law by criticizing the government, they could be legally penalized with a fine of 20,000 pounds ($3,650) and up to five years in prison. The Moltaqa Forum for Development and Human Rights Dialogue reported that between January and March 2009, 57 journalists from 13 newspapers faced legal penalties for their governmental critiques. The Egyptian government owns stock in the three largest daily newspapers. The government controls the licensing and distribution of all papers in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|title=Human Rights Report: Egypt|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/nea/136067.htm#|date=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian government shut down the Internet to most of Egypt during the recent protests in order to limit communication between protest groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Jordan|title=The day part of the Internet died: Egypt goes dark|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jan/28/day-part-internet-died-egypt-goes-dark/|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] and other proponents of demographic structural approach ([[cliodynamics]]), a basic problem in Egypt is unemployment driven by a demographic [[youth bulge]]: with the number of new people entering the job force at about 4% a year, unemployment in Egypt is almost 10 times as high for [[college graduate]]s as it is for people who have gone through elementary school, particularly educated urban youthâthe same people who were out in the streets during the revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;cliodynamics.ru&quot;&gt;[[Korotayev|Korotayev A.]], Zinkina J.

; Poor living conditions and economic conditions
{{see|Economy of Egypt}}
[[File:Flickr - Daveness 98 - Cityscape in Cairo.jpg|thumb|A poor neighbourhood in Cairo]]
Egypt's economy was highly centralised during the tenure of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] but opened up considerably under President Anwar Sadat and Mubarak. From 2004 to 2008 the Mubarak-led government aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract foreign investment and facilitate GDP growth, but postponed further economic reforms because of global economic turmoil. The international [[economic downturn]] slowed Egypt's GDP growth to 4.5% in 2009. In 2010 analysts said the government of Prime Minister [[Ahmed Nazif]] would need to restart economic reforms to attract foreign investment, boost growth, and improve economic conditions. Despite high levels of national economic growth over the past few years, living conditions for the average Egyptian remained poor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/wfbcurrent/egypt/egypt_economy.html|title=Egypt Economy 2011|author=Source: [[CIA World Factbook]] and other sources |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though better than many other countries in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;cliodynamics.ru&quot;/&gt;

===Corruption among government officials===
{{see|Crime in Egypt}}

Political corruption in Mubarak administration's [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Ministry of Interior]] rose dramatically due to the increased level of control over the institutional system necessary to prolong the presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Egypt after Mubarak&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rutherford|first=Bruce|title=Egypt after Mubarak: Liberalism, Islam, and Democracy in the Arab World|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2008|month=November|isbn= 0-6911-3665-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise to power of powerful businessmen in the NDP, in the government, and in the People's Assembly led to massive waves of anger during the years of Prime Ministers Ahmed Nazif's government.

During the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2010]], opposition groups complained of harassment and fraud perpetrated by the government.

In 2010 [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI) report assessed Egypt with a CPI score of 3.1, based on perceptions of the degree of corruption from business people and country analysts (with 10 being clean and 0 being totally corrupt).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results|title=CPI 2010 table|publisher=[[Transparency International]]|accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lead-up to the protests==
To prepare for a possible overthrow of Mubarak, opposition groups studied the work of [[Gene Sharp]] on non-violent revolution and worked with leaders of [[Otpor!]], the student-led [[Serbia]]n uprising of [[Overthrow of Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ|2000]]. Copies of Sharp's list of 198 non-violent &quot;weapons&quot;, translated into Arabic and not always attributed to him, were circulated in [[Tahrir Square]] during its occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news

After the ousting of Tunisian president [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] due to mass protests, many analysts, including former [[European Commission President]] [[Romano Prodi]], saw Egypt as the next country where such a revolution might occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Remondini|first=Chiara|title=Prodi Says Egypt to Be Monitored After Tunisia, Messaggero Says|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-16/prodi-says-egypt-to-be-monitored-after-tunisia-messaggero-says.html|accessdate=12 February 2011|newspaper=Bloomberg L.P.|date=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' commented, &quot;The Jasmine Revolution [...] should serve as a stark warning to Arab leaders â beginning with Egypt's 83-year-old Hosni Mubarak â that their refusal to allow more economic and political opportunity is dangerous and untenable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tunisia's revolution should be a wake-up call to Mideast autocrats|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/15/AR2011011503141.html|accessdate=11 February 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others held the opinion that Egypt was not ready for revolution, citing little aspiration of the Egyptian people, low educational levels, and a strong government with the support of the military.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeNoRev&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hauslohner|first=Abigail|title=After Tunisia: Why Egypt Isn't Ready to Have Its Own Revolution|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043497,00.html|accessdate=12 February 2011|newspaper=Time|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] said, &quot;The simple fact is that most Egyptians do not see any way that they can change their country or their lives through political action, be it voting, activism, or going out on the streets to demonstrate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leyne|first=Jon|title=No sign Egypt will take the Tunisian road|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12202937|accessdate=11 February 2011|newspaper=BBC |date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition groups planned a day of revolt for 25 January, coinciding with the [[National Police Day (Egypt)|National Police Day]]. The purpose was to protest against abuses by the police in front of the [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Ministry of Interior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim Brotherhood To Participate in 25&amp;nbsp;January Protest|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/303296|accessdate=8 April 2011|work=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|date=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These demands expanded to include the resignation of the Minister of Interior, an end to State corruption, the end of [[Emergency law in Egypt|Egyptian emergency law]], and [[term limit]]s for the president.

Many political movements, opposition parties, and public figures supported the day of revolt, including [[Youth for Justice and Freedom]], [[Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution]], the [[Popular Democratic Movement for Change]] and the [[National Association for Change]]. The [[6 April Youth Movement]] was a major supporter of the protest and distributed 20,000 leaflets saying &quot;I will protest on 25 January to get my rights&quot;.

'''25 January 2011''': The '''&quot;Day of Revolt&quot;''': Protests erupted throughout Egypt, with tens of thousands of protesters gathered in Cairo and thousands more in cities throughout Egypt. The protests targeted President Hosni Mubarak's government, and mostly adhered to non-violence. There were some reports of civilian and police casualties.

'''26 January 2011''': '''&quot;Shutting down The Internet and Mobile Services&quot;''': After several Facebook groups were created and tweets (from Twitter) called for mass demonstrations, the Egyptian government shut down internet access for most of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowie |first=James |url=http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml |title=Egypt Leaves the Internet |publisher=Renesys.com |accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to cripple one of the protesters' main organizational tools and to impede the flow of news and people.

'''28 January 2011''': The '''&quot;Friday of Anger&quot;''' protests began. Hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Cairo and other Egyptian cities after Friday prayers. Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei arrived in Cairo. There were reports of looting. Prisons were opened and burned down, allegedly on orders from then-Minister of the Interior Habib El Adly. Prison inmates escaped en masse, in what was believed to be an attempt to terrorise protesters. Police forces were withdrawn from the streets, and the military was deployed. International fears of violence grew, but no major casualties were reported. President Hosni Mubarak made his first address to the nation and pledged to form a new government. Later that night clashes broke out in Tahrir Square between revolutionaries and pro-Mubarak demonstrators, leading to the injury of several and the death of some.

'''29 January 2011''': The military presence in Cairo increased. A curfew was declared, but was widely ignored as the flow of defiant protesters to Tahrir Square continued throughout the night. The military reportedly refused to follow orders to fire live ammunition, and exercised restraint overall. There were no reports of major casualties.

'''1 February 2011''': Mubarak made another televised address and offered several concessions. He pledged to not run for another term in the elections planned for September, and pledged political reforms. He stated he would stay in office to oversee a peaceful transition. Small but violent clashes began that night between pro-Mubarak and anti-Mubarak groups.

'''2 February 2011''': '''&quot;Battle of the Camel&quot;'''. Violence escalated as waves of Mubarak supporters met anti-government protesters, and some Mubarak supporters rode on camels and horses into Tahrir Square, reportedly wielding swords and sticks. President Mubarak reiterated his refusal to step down in interviews with several news agencies. Incidents of violence toward journalists and reporters escalated amid speculation that the violence was being encouraged by Mubarak as a way to bring the protests to an end.

'''6 February 2011''': A multifaith Sunday Mass is held with [[Copts|Egyptian Christians]] and [[Islam in Egypt|Egyptian Muslims]] in Tahrir Square. Negotiations involving Egyptian Vice President [[Omar Suleiman]] and representatives of the opposition commenced amid continuing protests throughout the nation. The Egyptian army assumed greater security responsibilities, maintaining order and guarding The [[Egyptian Museum|Egyptian Museum of Antiquity]]. Suleiman offered reforms, while others of Mubarak's regime accused foreign nations, including the US, of interfering in Egyptâs affairs.

'''10 February 2011''': Mubarak formally addressed Egypt amid speculation of a military coup, but rather than resigning (as was widely expected), he simply stated he would delegate some of his powers to Vice President Suleiman, while continuing as Egypt's head of state. Reactions to Mubarak's statement were marked by anger, frustration and disappointment, and throughout various cities there was an escalation of the number and intensity of demonstrations.

'''11 February 2011''': The '''&quot;Friday of Departure&quot;''': Massive protests continued in many cities as Egyptians refused the concessions announced by Mubarak. Finally, at 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm local time, Suleiman announced Mubarak's resignation, entrusting the Supreme Council of Egyptian Armed Forces with the leadership of the country. Nationwide celebrations immediately followed.

'''13 February 2011''': The Supreme Council dissolved Egyptâs parliament and suspended the Constitution in response to demands by demonstrators. The council declared that it would hold power for six months, or until elections could be held. Calls were made for the council to provide more details and specific timetables and deadlines. Major protests subsided but did not end. In a gesture to a new beginning, protesters cleaned up and renovated Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the demonstrations, although many pledged they would continue protests until all the demands had been met.

'''17 February 2011''': The army stated it would not field a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forexyard.com/en/news/Egypt-army-says-wont-field-presidential-candidate-2011-02-17T144839Z |title=Egypt army says won't field presidential candidate |publisher=Forexyard.com |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four important figures of the former regime were detained on that day: former interior minister [[Habib el-Adly]], former minister of housing [[Ahmed Maghrabi]] former tourism minister [[Zuheir Garana]], and steel tycoon [[Ahmed Ezz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12500968 |title=BBC News â Egypt after Mubarak: Three ex-ministers arrested |publisher=BBC |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''5 March 2011''': Several [[State Security Intelligence]] (SSI) buildings were raided across Egypt by protesters, including the headquarters for [[Alexandria Governorate]] and the main national headquarters in [[Nasr City]], Cairo. Protesters stated they raided the buildings to secure documents they believed to show various crimes committed by the SSI against the people of Egypt during Mubarak's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/201134228359128.html | title=Egypt security building stormed | publisher=Al Jazeera English | date=5 March 2011 | accessdate=7 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12674714 | title=Egyptians demand secret police give up torture secrets | author=Leithead, Alastair | publisher=BBC [[BBC News|News]] | date=8 March 2011 | accessdate=8 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reactions==
{{Main|International reactions to the 2011 Egyptian revolution}}

International reactions have varied with most Western states saying peaceful protests should continue but also expressing concern for the stability of the country and the region. The European Union's Foreign Affairs Chief issued a statement saying &quot;I also reiterate my call upon the Egyptian authorities to urgently establish a constructive and peaceful way to respond to the legitimate aspirations of Egyptian citizens for democratic and socioeconomic reforms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ashton|first=Catherine|title=Factbox: International Reaction to Egyptian Protests|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/29/us-egypt-world-idUSTRE70S2B920110129?pageNumber=2|accessdate=9 April 2011|agency=Reuters |date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, Britain, France, Germany and others issued similar statements calling for reforms and an end to violence against peaceful protesters. Many states in the region expressed concern and supported Mubarak, in particular Saudi Arabia, which issued a statement saying it &quot;strongly condemned&quot; the protests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=CNN Wire Staff|title=Egypt Protests Draw Mixed Reaction in Region|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-01-29/world/egypt.middle.east.reaction_1_egyptian-people-egyptian-president-hosni-mubarak-populous-arab-nation?_s=PM:WORLD|accessdate=9 April 2011|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, like Tunisia and Iran, supported the protests. Israel was most cautious for a change, with [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] asking his government ministers to maintain silence, and urging Israel's US and European allies to curb their criticism of President Mubarak;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's Big Fears over a Post-Mubarak Egypt|url=http://www.euronews.net/2011/01/31/israels-big-fears-over-a-post-mubarak-egypt/|accessdate=31 January 2011|work=[[Euronews]]|date=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel Urges World To Curb Criticism of Egypt's Mubarak|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-urges-world-to-curb-criticism-of-egypt-s-mubarak-1.340238|accessdate=31 January 2011|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, an [[Arab-Israeli]] parliamentarian supported the protests. There were also numerous solidarity protests for the anti-government protesters around the world.

NGOs also expressed concern about the protests and the ensuing heavy-handed state response. Amnesty International described attempts to discourage protests as &quot;unacceptable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trimel|first=Suzanne|title=Amnesty International Rebukes Egyptian Leaders for &quot;Failed&quot; Response to Protest Demands Organization Says Leadersâ Efforts to Discourage Protests are &quot;Unacceptable&quot;|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGUSA20110211001&amp;lang=e&amp;rss=recentnews|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries also issued travel warnings or began evacuating their citizens, including the US, Israel, Great Britain, and Japan. Even [[multinational corporation]]s began evacuating their [[expatriate]] workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/30/egypt.evacuations/|title=Foreign governments, businesses begin evacuations from Egypt|publisher=CNN|date=30 January 2011|accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many university students were also evacuated.

===Reform process===
{{see also|Egyptian constitutional review committee of 2011}}
The protests initiated a process of social and political reform by articulating a series of demands. Reform began with President Mubarak's announcements that concessions would be made towards reform and was highlighted by his resignation 18 days after the protests started. The list of demands for broader changes in Egyptian society and governance, articulated by protesters and activists, includes the following:

On 17 February, an Egyptian prosecutor ordered the detention of three ex-ministers, former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli, former Tourism Minister Zuhair Garana and former Housing Minister Ahmed el-Maghrabi, and a prominent businessman, steel magnate Ahmed Ezz, pending trial on suspicion of wasting public funds. The public prosecutor also froze the accounts of Adli and his family members on accusations that over 4&amp;nbsp;million Egyptian pounds ($680,000) were transferred to his personal account by a head of a contractor company, while calling on the Foreign Minister to contact European countries and ask them to freeze the accounts of the defendants.&lt;ref name=&quot;AJEgypt_Ministers&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt detains ex-ministers |author=[[Al-Jazeera English]]|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011217221111216445.html |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the United States announced on the same day that it was giving Egypt $150&amp;nbsp;million in crucial economic assistance to help it transition towards democracy following the overthrow of long time president Mubarak. US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] said that [[William Joseph Burns|William Burns]], the Under-secretary of State for political affairs, and [[David Lipton]], a senior White House adviser on international economics, would travel to Egypt the following week.&lt;ref name=AJEgypt_Ministers/&gt;

On 19 February, a moderate Islamic party, named ({{Lang-ar|Ø­Ø²Ø¨ Ø§ÙÙØ³Ø· Ø§ÙØ¬Ø¯ÙØ¯}}) [[Al-Wasat Party|Al-Wasat Al-Jadid]], or the '''New Center Party''', which was outlawed for 15 years was granted official recognition by an Egyptian court. The party was founded in 1996 by activists who split off from the Muslim Brotherhood and sought to create a tolerant Islamic movement with liberal tendencies, but its attempts to register as an official party were rejected four times since then. On the same day, Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq said 222 political prisoners would be released. He said only a few were detained during the popular uprising and put the number of remaining political prisoners at 487, but did not say when they would be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt recognizes moderate Islamic party, promises to release political prisoners |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/crisis-in-egypt/egypt-recognizes-moderate-islamic-party-promises-to-release-political-prisoners/article1914290/ |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011 |location=Toronto |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March, Prime Minister Shafik submitted his resignation to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. The Council appointed [[Essam Sharaf]], a former Minister of Transport who began vocal criticism of the regime following his resignation, particularly after the [[Qalyoub rail accident]] in 2006, to replace Shafik and form a new government.

He was founder and first emir of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], and implicated in the assassination of President Anwar Sadat on 6 October 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkins2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Stephen E.|title=The 9/11 EncyclopÃ¦dia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PDDIgWRN_HQC&amp;pg=PA456|accessdate=6 May 2011|date=31 May 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598849219|pages=456â}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May, former Egyptian President Mubarak was ordered to stand trial on charges of [[premeditated murder]] of peaceful protestors during the 2011 Egyptian revolution and, if convicted, could face the death penalty. The full list of charges released by the public prosecutor was &quot;intentional murder, attempted killing of some demonstrators...misuse of influence and deliberately wasting public funds and unlawfully making private financial gains and profits.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reutersmurdercharges&quot;/&gt;

==Analysis==
===Regional instability===
{{main|Arab Spring}}
The Egyptian Revolution, along with the events in Tunisia, have sparked a [[Revolutionary wave|wave of major uprisings]]. [[Demonstration (people)|Demonstrations]] and protests have spread across the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]]. To date [[2010â2011 Algerian protests|Algeria]], [[2011 Bahraini protests|Bahrain]], [[2011 Iranian protests|Iran]], [[2011 Jordanian protests|Jordan]], [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]], [[2011 Morocco protests|Morocco]],[[2011 Yemeni uprising|Yemen]], and [[2011 Syrian uprising|Syria]] have all witnessed major protests. In addition, minor incidents have occurred in [[2011 Iraqi protests|Iraq]], Kuwait, [[Mauritania]], [[2011 Omani protests|Oman]], [[2011 Saudi Arabian protests|Saudi Arabia]], Somalia, and [[2011 Sudanese protests|Sudan]].

===Religion and politics===

The protests in Egypt were not centred around religion-based politics, but nationalism and a broad-based social consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the uprising, the most organised and prominent opposition movements throughout the Arab world usually came from Islamist organisations that relied on a conviction of their faith, where members were motivated and ready to sacrifice. However, secular forces emerged from the revolution touting principles that religious groups shared with them: freedom, social justice, and dignity. Islamist organisations also emerged with greater freedom to operate. Although the cooperative, inter-faith revolution itself was no guarantee that partisan politics would not re-emerge in its wake, its success nonetheless represented a change from the intellectual stagnation created by decades of repression which simply pitted modernity and Islam against one another as conflicting and incompatible. Islamists and secularists both have been faced with new opportunities for dialogue and discourse, on matters such as the role of Islam and Sharia in society and freedom of speech, as well as the impact of secularism on a predominantly Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the optimism surrounding the revolution, several commentators have expressed concerns about the risk of increased power and influence for Islamist forces in the country and the region at large, as well as the difficulties of integrating the different groups, ideologies, and visions for the country among the population. Journalist [[Caroline Glick]] argued that the Egyptian revolution portends a rise in religious radicalism and support for terrorism, citing a 2010 [[Pew]] Opinion poll which found that Egyptians support Islamists over modernizers by a ratio of over 2 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=206121|title=Our World: Clueless in Washington|author=Glick, Caroline|accessdate=10 April 2011|publisher=Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Shlomo Ben-Ami]] argued that Egypt's most formidable task is to refute the old paradigm of the Arab World that sees the only choices for regimes as between either repressive, secular dictatorships or repressive theocracies. He noted, however that with Islam such a central part of the society, any emergent regime is bound to be attuned to religion. In his view a democracy that excluded all religion from public life, as in France, could succeed in Egypt and no Arab democracy could disallow the participation of political Islam if it were to be genuine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shlomo Ben Ari&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benami51/English7 |title=Saving the Egyptian Revolution |publisher=[[Project Syndicate]] |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the revolution Islamist parties such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] have shown unprecedented strength in the new more democratic landscape, taking leading roles in constitutional changes, voter mobilization, and protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/world/middleeast/21egypt.htm|title=Egyptian Voters Approve Constitutional Changes|author=MacFarquhar, Neil|accessdate=10 April 2011|work=New York Times|date=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley |first=Matt |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704587004576244922383434098.html |title=Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood to Rejoin Protests |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=3 February 2011 |accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a noted concern among the secular and youth movements, who wanted any elections to be held later rather than sooner, so that they might catch up with the already well-organized groups. Elections are to be held in September 2011 and it is unclear which group or approach will prevail.

===Women's role===

[[Women in Egypt|Egyptian women]] were active throughout the revolution. Some took part in the protests themselves, were present in news clips and on Facebook forums, and were part of the leadership during the Egyptian revolution. In Tahrir Square, female protesters, some with their children, worked to support the protests. The diversity of the protesters in Tahrir Square was visible in the women who participated; many wore head scarves and other signs of religious conservatism, while others revelled in the freedom to kiss a friend or smoke a cigarette in public. Egyptian women also organised protests, and reported on the events; female bloggers such as Leil Zahra Mortada risked abuse or imprisonment by keeping the world informed of the daily scene in Tahrir Square and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Middle Eastâs Feminist Revolution&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide participation and the significant contributions by Egyptian women to the protests have been attributed to the fact that many, especially younger women, are better educated than previous generations, representing more than half of Egyptian university students. This has been an empowering factor for women, who have become more present and active publicly in recent years. The advent of social media has also helped provide tools for women to become protest leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Middle Eastâs Feminist Revolution&quot;/&gt;

The [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] enjoy a better reputation with the public than the police does, the former perceived as a professional body protecting the country, the latter accused of [[systemic corruption]] and illegitimate violence. All four [[Egyptian president]]s since the 1950s have come from the military into power. Key Egyptian military personnel include the Defense Minister [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] and General [[Sami Hafez Enan]], Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110213/D9LC1NLO0.html |title=Key members of Egypt Armed Forces Supreme Council |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Ian Black (journalist)|Black, Ian]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/30/egypt-military-hosni-mubarak|title=All Eyes on Egypt's Military as Hosni Mubarak Fortifies Position |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=30 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian military totals around 468,500 well-armed active personnel, plus a reserve of 479,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/01/30/uk-egypt-protests-military-idUKTRE70T29420110130|title=Factbox â Egypt's Powerful Military|agency=Reuters |date=30 January 2011|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Head of Egypt's Armed Forces, Tantawi has been described as &quot;aged and change-resistant&quot; and is attached to the old regime. He has used his position as Defense Minister to oppose reforms, economic and political, which he saw as weakening central government authority. Other key figures, Sami Enan chief among them, are younger and have closer connections to both the US and groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. An important aspect of the relationship between the Egyptian and American military establishments is the 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion dollars in military aid provided to Egypt annually, which in turn pays for American-made military equipment, and allows Egyptian officers to receive training in the US. Guaranteed this aid package, the governing [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|military council]] is for the most reform-resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/14/wikileaks-cables-egyptian-military-head |title=WikiLeaks cables: Egyptian military head is 'old and resistant to change' |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |first1=Julian |last1=Borger |first2=James |last2=Ball}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/feb/04/egypt-arms-trade?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=Egypt's military-industrial complex |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=4 February 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011 |first=Pratap |last=Chatterjee}}&lt;/ref&gt; One analyst however, while conceding that the military is change-resistant, states it has no option but to facilitate the process of democratisation. Furthermore, the military will have to keep its role in politics limited to continue good relations with the West, and must not restrict the participation of political Islam if there is to be a genuine democracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shlomo Ben Ari&quot;/&gt;

As provisioned in the 1978 [[Camp David Accords]], which led to the peace treaty, both Israel and Egypt receive billions of dollars in aid annually from the United States, with Egypt receiving over US$1.3&amp;nbsp;billion of military aid each year in addition to economic and development assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Background Note: Egypt| publisher=[[United States Department of State]]| date=10 November 2010| url = http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5309.htm| accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Juan Cole, many Egyptian youth feel ignored by Mubarak on the grounds that he is not looking out for their best interests and that he rather serves the interests of the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;cole&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/30/opinion/main20030008.shtml|title=Why Egypt's Class Conflict Is Boiling Over â Juan Cole: How Decades of Economic Stumbles Set the Stage for Egypt's Current Political Turmoil|author=Cole, Juan (essay)|date=30 January 2011|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperation of the Egyptian regime in enforcing the [[blockade of the Gaza Strip]] was also deeply unpopular among the general Egyptian public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/25/egypt.israelandthepalestinians1 |title=Mubarak under pressure &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=6 February 2011 |date=25 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online activism and the role of social media===
[[File:AlJazeeraEgypt.png|left|thumb|Coverage by the news network [[Al Jazeera English]] provided information about the revolution outside Egypt.]]

The April 6 Youth Movement (Arabic: Ø­Ø±ÙØ© Ø´Ø¨Ø§Ø¨ 6 Ø£Ø¨Ø±ÙÙâ) is an Egyptian Facebook group started in Spring 2008 to support the workers in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, an industrial town, who were planning to strike on April 6.
Activists called on participants to wear black and stay home on the day of the strike. Bloggers and citizen journalists used Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, blogs and other new media tools to report on the strike, alert their networks about police activity, organize legal protection and draw attention to their efforts.
The New York Times has identified the movement as the political Facebook group in Egypt with the most dynamic debates. As of January 2009[update], it had 70,000 predominantly young and educated members, most of whom had not been politically active before; their core concerns include free speech, nepotism in government and the country's stagnant economy. Their discussion forum on Facebook features intense and heated discussions, and is constantly updated with new postings.

the founders of the movement 
* Ahmed Maher was a prominent participant in the anti-Mubarak demonstrations in Egypt in 2011.

* Asmaa Mahfouz posted a video blog that went viral. She urged the Egyptian people to join her in a protest on January 25, in Tahrir Square to bring down Mubarakâs regime and urged people not to be afraid.

* Waleed Rashed (Arabic ÙÙÙØ¯ Ø±Ø§Ø´Ø¯ ) born November 15, 1983 in El Sharkia, Egypt), is one of the co-founders of the April 6 Youth Movement and a prominent participant in the anti-Mubarak demonstrations in Egypt in 2011.

[[We are all Khaled Said|We Are All Khaled Saeed]] is a Facebook group which formed in the aftermath of Saeed's beating and death. The group attracted hundreds of thousands of members worldwide and played a prominent role in spreading and bringing attention to the growing discontent. As the protests began, Google executive [[Wael Ghonim]] revealed that he was the person behind the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Who is Wael Ghonim?|date=8 February 2011|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url = http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2011/02/08/f-wael-ghonim.html|work=CBC News|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later after the revolution, in an TV interview in the presence of member of the ruling military council, it was revealed that AbdulRahman Mansour, a young underground activist and media expert shared the account with Wael Ghonim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = ØªÙØ±ÙØ± Ø®Ø§Øµ- ÙÙ Ø¯Ø§Ø®Ù Ø§ÙØ«ÙØ±Ø© Ø§ÙÙØµØ±ÙØ©|url = http://ara.reuters.com/article/topNews/idARACAE73C0QW20110413?sp=true|date=13 April 2011|agency=Reuters |format = transcript|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another potent viral online contribution was made by [[Asmaa Mahfouz]], a female activist who posted a video in which she challenged people to publicly protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Women play vital role in Egypt's uprising|url = http://www.npr.org/2011/02/04/133497422/Women-Play-Vital-Role-In-Egypts-Uprising|date=4 February 2011|work=National Public Radio|format = transcript|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Facebook had suspended the group because some of its administrators were using pseudonyms, a violation of the company's 'Terms of Service.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Can Egypt's Internet Movement Be Exported?|date=18 February 2011|publisher=[[The Nation]]|url = http://www.thenation.com/print/article/158717/can-egypts-internet-movement-be-exported|work=The Nation|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is readily believed that a handful of people through Facebook, Twitter, and blogging sparked this uprising. One of which is [[Wael Ghonim]]. Many believe Ghonim was the first contributor to spark the Egypt revolution when he created a Facebook page dedicated to Khaled Saeed entitled [[We are all Khaled Said|We Are All Khaled Saeed]] . Saeed, an Egyptian business man was beaten to death by police in June 2010. It is believed that this was in retaliation to a video he posted showing Egyptian police sharing the spoils of a drug bust. The Facebook page blew up to over 400,000 followers, creating an online arena where protestors and those discontent with the government could gather, vent, and organise. The page called for protests on 25 January, Known as the day of wrath. Hundreds of thousands of protestors flooded the streets to show their discontent with the murder and the corruption within their country. Ghonim was jailed the 28th and released 12 days later. Ghonim has also gained quite a large following through his Twitter account where he has been creating a narrative of the events happening day to day in Egypt. Ghonim is the Middle East and North African marketing manager at Google. He is currently on leave.

Another major contributor is Egyptian activist and member of the 6 April movement

Though these two are credited with being the first social media faces of this revolution, since the 25th people have posted videos, tweeted, and wrote Facebook comments to keep the world abreast of the turmoil in Egypt. Including videos posted of a badly beaten Khaled Said, disproving the first claims by the police that he had choked to death. Ali documents the various ways in which social media was used by Egyptian activists, some of the most prominent Egyptian celebrities, and as well by major political figures abroad to invigorate the protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ali185-189&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amir |last=Ali |url=http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf |title=The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=185â189, 208â210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sharif Abdel Kouddous]], a journalist with [[Democracy Now!]] had provided live coverage and [[Twitter|tweets]] from [[Tahrir Square]] during the protests and has also been credited with using new media to raise awareness regarding the protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2011/3/30/sharif_abdel_kouddous_transitions_from_democracy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pulitzercenter.org/people/sharif-abdel-kouddous]&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of social media in the Egyptian uprising has since been widely written and debated about, including in the first edition of the [[Dubai Debates]] on the question &quot;Mark Zuckerberg â the new hero of the Arab people?&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dubaidebates.com/debates/view/1/mark-zuckerberg-the-new-hero-of-the-arab-people]&lt;/ref&gt; Many have argued, based in part on the Egyptian revolution, that social media may be an effective tool in developing nations more generally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ali205-208&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amir |last=Ali |url=http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf |title=The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=205â208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freedom was given to establish political parties only by &quot;notifying&quot; concerned authorities, resulting in establishing several political parties named after or in relation to the 25 January revolution. See [[List of political parties in Egypt]].
