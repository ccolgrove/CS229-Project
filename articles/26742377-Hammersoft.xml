'''Yogi Bear''' is a fictional bear who appears in animated cartoons created by [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. He made his debut in 1958 as a supporting character in ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]''. Yogi Bear was the first [[breakout character]] created by Hanna-Barbera, and was eventually more popular than Huckleberry Hound.&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, Michael. ''Hanna-Barbera Cartoons''. New York: Hugh Lauter Levin Associates, 1998. ISBN 0-88363-108-3. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1961, he was given his own show, ''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'', sponsored by [[Kellogg's]], which included the segments ''[[Snagglepuss]]'' and ''[[Yakky Doodle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sennett, Ted. ''The Art of Hanna-Barbera: Fifty Years of Creativity''. New York: Viking Penguin, 1989. ISBN 0-670-82978-1. pp. 63â64.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hokey Wolf]]'' replaced his segment on ''The Huckleberry Hound Show''.&lt;ref&gt;Sennett, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; A musical animated feature film, ''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', was produced in 1964.  Yogi was one of several Hanna-Barbera characters to have a [[Detachable collar|collar]]. This allowed animators to keep his body static, redrawing only his head in each [[Film frame|frame]] when he spoke. This reduced the number of drawings needed for a seven-minute cartoon from around 14,000 to around 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6193603.stm &quot;Hanna Barbera's golden age of animation&quot;], ''BBC'', December 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Like many Hanna-Barbera characters, Yogi's personality and mannerisms were based on a popular celebrity of the time.  [[Art Carney]]'s [[Ed Norton (Honeymooners)|Ed Norton]] character on ''[[The Honeymooners]]'' was said to be Yogi's inspiration;&lt;ref&gt;Sennett, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Breznican&quot;&gt;Anthony, Breznican. &quot;Yogi Bear gets a digital makeover.&quot; USA Today n.d.: Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 9 Dec. 2010. &quot;Yogi, as voiced by the late Daws Butler in the early 1960s, was a takeoff on Art Carney's Ed Norton from The Honeymooners -- itself a character heavily influenced by the Borscht Belt and vaudeville comics.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; his voice mannerisms broadly mimic Carney as Norton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sennett59&quot;&gt;Sennett, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Norton, in turn, received influence from [[Borscht Belt]] and comedians of [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Breznican&quot;/&gt;1

Yogi's name is commonly seen as a nod to the famed baseball star [[Yogi Berra]]. The plot of most of Yogi's cartoons centered on his antics in the fictional Jellystone Park, a takeoff on the famous [[Yellowstone National Park]]. Yogi, accompanied by his constant companion [[Boo-Boo Bear]], would often try to steal picnic baskets from campers in the park, much to the displeasure of Park [[Ranger Smith]]. Yogi's girlfriend, [[Cindy Bear]], sometimes appeared and usually disapproved of Yogi's antics.

The name &quot;Jellystone Park&quot; and the concept of a hungry bear who steals campers' food was a theme of an [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM animated short]] titled ''[[Barney Bear|Barney]]'s Hungry Cousin'' which had debuted in 1953.{{cn|date=July 2011}}

==Catchphrases==
Besides often speaking in [[rhyme]], Yogi Bear had a number of [[catchphrase]]s, including his [[pet name]] for picnic baskets (&quot;pic-a-nic baskets&quot;) and his favorite self-promotion (&quot;I'm smarter than the average bear!&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; although he often overestimates his own cleverness.  Another characteristic of Yogi was his deep and silly voice. He often greets the ranger with a cordial, &quot;Hello, Mr. Ranger, sir!&quot; and &quot;Hey there, Boo Boo!&quot; as his preferred greeting to his [[sidekick]], Boo Boo. Yogi would also often use puns in his speech, and have a habit of pronouncing large words with a long vocal flourish.

==Portrayers==
From the time of the character's debut until 1988, Yogi was voiced by [[voice actor]] [[Daws Butler]]. Butler died in 1988; his last performance as Yogi was in the television film ''[[Yogi and the Invasion of the Space Bears]]''. After Butler's death, [[Greg Burson]] stepped in to perform the role (Butler had taught Burson personally how to voice Yogi as well as his other characters). Greg Burson died in 2008. [[Jeff Bergman]] also performed the character throughout the 1990s for various [[Cartoon Network]] commercials and bumpers. In the [[Yogi Bear (film)|''Yogi Bear'']] film, the character is voiced by actor [[Dan Aykroyd]]. In the animated [[stop motion]] [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' created by [[Seth Green]], [[Dan Milano]] voiced Yogi Bear.&lt;ref&gt;http://voicechasers.com/database/showactor.php?actorid=6895&lt;/ref&gt;
