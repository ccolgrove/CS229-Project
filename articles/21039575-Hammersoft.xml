'''Disney Junior Latin America''' is a [[cable television]] [[television channel|channel]] and is a version of [[The Walt Disney Company]]-owned [[Disney Junior]], broadcasting in all [[Latin America]]. It is broadcast in three feeds: North Zone, South Zone and [[Brazil]]. It is marketed to preschoolers. Disney Junior is operated by Disney &amp; ESPN Media Networks Latin America and The Walt Disney Company Latin America, both of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It was launched on June 1, 2008 as '''Playhouse Disney Channel'''. Formerly it only was a programming block in the mornings of [[Disney Channel Latin America]], where it still is a programming block, as '''Disney Junior en/no Disney Channel'''. The [[Television program|programs]] are very similar to the Disney Junior channel and Disney Junior on Disney Channel block in the [[United States]]. However, the channel also airs non-original programming.

On [[December 23]], [[2010]] [[The Walt Disney Company|The Walt Disney Company Latin America]] announced that the channel would be replaced by [[Disney Junior]] sometime in [[2011]]&lt;ref name=&quot;junior&quot;&gt;http://www.realtvnews.com.ar/new/noticias.php?id=5045&lt;/ref&gt;, and the relaunched eventually happened, on April 1, 2011.

== History ==

[[Image:Playhouse Disney En.png|thumb|200px|Playhouse Disney Channel logo, used from 2008-2011.]]

The channel started as a programming block in the mornings of [[Disney Channel Latin America]] airing original programming focused on preschoolers. An original production, produced by RGB Entertainment, and with the name &quot;La Casa de Playhouse Disney&quot; (&quot;Playhouse Disney's House&quot;) aired on the block, with two hosts reading stories and playing games with the kids, as well as introducing the series. 

On June 1, 2008 ''Disney &amp; ESPN Media Networks Latin America'' launched Playhouse Disney Channel as a 24-hour independent channel, initially only in [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]], eventually reaching more countries in [[Latin America]]. The new channel was hosted by [[Ooh, Aah &amp; You|Ooh and Aah]], two monkey hosts. 
The programming block on [[Disney Channel Latin America]] is still aired in the mornings but with a reduced schedule.

The &quot;Playhouse Disney&quot; show with the two hosts was dropped both from the programming block and from the channel, being totally replaced with [[Ooh, Aah &amp; You|Ooh and Aah]] since June 1, 2008 (in Latin America Ooh and Aah were hosts only). This segment is renumbered (La casa de Playhouse Disney in Brazil A Casa do Playhouse Disney)  (Playhouse Disney's House).

On [[December 23]], [[2010]], ''The Walt Disney Company Latin America'' announced that Playhouse Disney Channel would be replaced by [[Disney Junior]] sometime in [[2011]].&lt;ref name=&quot;junior&quot; /&gt; The channel keeps up with 24-hour of programming aimed to preschoolers and received new online services which will allow to see entire episodes, musical videos and other content in websites.
