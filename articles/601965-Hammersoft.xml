'''MAN Diesel SE''' (formerly '''MAN B&amp;W Diesel AG''') was a provider of large-bore [[diesel engine]]s for [[marine propulsion]] systems and [[power plant]] applications.  MAN Diesel employs over 7,700 staff, primarily in Germany, Denmark, France, the Czech Republic, India and China.  The global after-sales organisation, MAN Diesel PrimeServ, comprises a network of the companyâs own service centres, supported by authorised partners.

In 2010, MAN Diesel and [[MAN Turbo]] were merged to form [[MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo]].

==History==
In 1980, [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] acquired the [[Burmeister &amp; Wain]] Danish shipyard and diesel engine producer.  Though engine production at Christianshavn was later discontinued in 1987, successful engine programs were rolled out.  At Teglholmen in 1988 a spare parts and key components production factory was established as was an R&amp;D Centre at the same site in 1992.  Though all Copenhagen operations were consolidated at Teglholmen in 1994 and the last volume production unit at the B&amp;W Shipyard was delivered in 1996, in 2000 MAN B&amp;W Diesel two-stroke diesel engines had over 70% market share, with a substantial number of MC-line engines on order.

The electronically controlled line of ME diesel two-stroke engines was added in 2002 with a maximum cylinder bore of 108&amp;nbsp;cm.  MAN B&amp;W Diesel, Denmark, employed approximately 2,200 at the end of 2003 and had 100 GW, or more than 8000 MC engines, in service or on order by 2004.

In 2006 the MAN Diesel AG established a common European corporation named MAN Diesel SE (Societas Europaea).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mandiesel.se/&lt;/ref&gt;

Copenhagen, 22 February 2006: The first diesel engine with more than {{convert|100000|bhp|abbr=on}} has gone into service. MAN B&amp;W Diesel licensee Hyundai Heavy Industries in Korea has built the 12K98MC with {{convert|101640|bhp|abbr=on}}.

The engine is installed in the first of a series of container ships with a capacity over 9,000 teu being built for Greek owner Costamare. The vessels will be chartered to COSCON (COSCO Container Lines) in China.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mandiesel.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===British acquisitions===
MAN Diesel owns{{When|date=February 2011}} the former diesel businesses of [[English Electric]], Mirrlees Blackstone, [[Napier &amp; Son]], [[Paxman (engines)|Paxman]], and [[Ruston (engine builder)|Ruston]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mandiesel.com/category_000109.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirrlees Blackstone Limited was formed on June 1, 1969 by the merger of Mirrlees National Limited and [[Blackstone &amp; Co|Blackstone &amp; Company Limited]].  All were, at the time, members of the [[Hawker Siddeley]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enginemuseum.org/mrindex.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
MAN Diesel has production places at [[Augsburg]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Frederikshavn]], [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] and [[Shanghai]].
