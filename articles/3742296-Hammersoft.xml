'''''Shaun the Sheep''''' is a British [[stop-motion]] [[animated]] [[children's television series]] produced by [[Aardman Animations]], and commissioned by the [[BBC]] and the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]]. It first aired in the UK on [[CBBC Channel|CBBC]] in March 2007. The show consists of 80 episodes in 2 seasons, and is currently in hiatus.

== Synopsis ==
A premise of the series is that Shaun the sheep exhibits human intelligence, creativity, and behaviour in a farm setting, which usually provides a [[situational comedy]] conflict which Shaun must resolve before the end of each episode. Recurring themes include the characters evading the sheepdog Bitzer (though he is sometimes with the sheep in their escapades) and avoiding discovery by the Farmer. 

Episodes are very much a combination of [[slapstick]] and classic [[silent comedy]] in Aardmanâs recognizable animation style. There is no spoken dialogue, even by human characters. In this way it is reminiscent of silent comedy films and even [[Pingu]] and the animated version of [[Mr. Bean]]. However, simple grunts, bleats, and sighs are all used to add subtle expression to each character's moods and feelings.

== Theme Song ==
Based on the theme song, a longer, compact disc version was released under the title &quot;Life's a Treat&quot;, performed by [[Vic Reeves]],

== Shaun's First Appearance ==
Shaun the Sheep made his first &quot;official&quot; appearance in [[Wallace &amp; Gromit]]'s third short feature, the [[Academy Award]] winning &quot;[[A Close Shave]]&quot; as the youngest member of a flock of sheep Wallace and Gromit work to save from an evil mechanical dog that wants to turn them all into dog food for profit.  Shaun does show a hint of intelligence, though he proves to be a big factor in saving the day.  Shaun and the entire herd are also seen living with the inventive duo (much to Wallace's annoyance since they eat ''everything'' in sight, including furniture and clothes as well as his beloved cheese), though none of this seems to be part of this series' canon, or it can be surmised Wallace simply sold off the flock to The Farmer where Shaun and his friends now reside.

Shaun also made a brief cameo appearance with the duo in one of the episodes (entitled &quot;[[Shopper 13]]&quot;) of Wallace &amp; Gromit's &quot;[[Cracking Contraptions]]&quot; web series of shorts.

==Characters==
[[File:Richard Goleszowski.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Goleszowski at Canterbury's Anifest 2008 with models of one of the sheep in the flock, Bitzer, Timmy, and Shaun.]]

=== Major characters ===
*'''Shaun''' is the main [[protagonist]] of the series and the leader of the flock. He is a clever sheep and keeps his head. He has a good friendship with Bitzer.
*'''Bitzer''' &lt;!-- discussion taken to Talk --Lexein --&gt; is the farmer's long-suffering [[Herding dog|sheepdog]] and a good friend to Shaun. Bitzer does his best to keep Shaun's pals out of trouble.
*'''Shirley''' can be described as an eating machine. She's so big that she often gets stuck and needs the other sheep to push, pull or even sling-shot her out of trouble, even using heavy equipment at times.
*'''Timmy''' is Shaun's cousin. He may be the baby of the flock, but is often at the center of things. Luckily his mum is always there to keep him safe. He also appears as the main star in the spinoff ''[[Timmy Time]]''.
*'''Timmy's Mother''' wears curlers in her hair, and is a bit careless about maternal duties, even using Timmy once as some sort of a paint brush. But when her offspring goes astray, she is inconsolable until he is safely back in her care. She is also Shaun's aunt.
*'''The Flock''' are the one big happy, if slightly dopey, family: The sheep like to play and create mischief together, though it's usually Shaun and Bitzer who sort out the resulting mess.
*'''The Farmer''' is a [[drum and bass]]-loving [[Wales|Welshman]] (voiced by John Sparkes) who runs the farm with Bitzer at his side. He is completely oblivious to the human-like intelligence (or even the stupidity) of his flock. His disastrous attempts at dating are an ongoing joke of the series.
*'''The Pigs''' are the main [[antagonist]]s of the series. They're always trying to antagonize the Sheep and get them into trouble. They are, however, scared of Bitzer, who puts them in line. They are bullies to Shaun and his flock, and they got told off in &quot;Pig Trouble&quot; (Series 2) by the farmer.
*'''Pidsley''' is the cat, he's minor character in season 1 and major character in season 2 and desires to be the sole recipient of the Farmer's attention. He is jealous of Bitzer's relationship with the farmer and dislikes the sheep, thinking of them as stupid and beneath him.

===Minor characters===
==== Animals ====
*'''The Rooster''' appears at the start of the opening credits. He also kicked out one of the sheep that intruded in the coop in &quot;Sheepwalking&quot;.
*'''The Mother Hen''' left her clutch of four eggs for a walk, only to find the nest empty (only eggshells were left). She then went out to look for them, posting &quot;missing&quot; signs everywhere, even forgetting her fear as she asked The Bull for her chicks' whereabouts, and looked for them at night. She appears in &quot;Whoâs the Mummy?&quot; and &quot;In the Doghouse&quot;, where the flock throw her a party in the chicken coop.
*'''Baby Chicks''' are chicks that easily annoy Shaun. They always follow wherever Shaun goes (because Shaun was [[imprinting (psychology)|the first thing they saw upon hatching]]), and in order to make them accept Mother Hen as their real mother, the flock turned Shaun's fleece into clothing for her (because they like Shaun's fleece). They appear in &quot;Who's the Mummy?&quot; and one makes a cameo appearance in &quot;The Farmer's Niece&quot;.
*'''The Duck''' In the first series, the duck suffers collateral damage due to Shaunâs exploits in &quot;[[Off the Baa!]]&quot;, &quot;Tidy Up&quot;, and &quot;Bath Time&quot;. Sometimes he is seen with his ladyfriends. In series two there are two ducks that act as more of a double act. In series two, the ducks have been replaced with a pure white duck.
*'''Mower Mouth''' the Goat is an unstoppable eating machine: While not an unfriendly character, all his considerable energy is focused on his next meal. He appears in an episode named after him, and also on &quot;Saturday Night Shaun&quot;. He was also routinely causing trouble for Shaun and the flock in ''Shaun the Farmer.''
*'''The Bull''' is belligerent, powerful, and easily provoked by Shaunâs antics and the colour red. He appears in &quot;The Bull&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Shaun&quot;, &quot;Who's the Mummy?&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal Shaun&quot;. When Shaun orders a red bed sheet, he stops chasing the other sheep (painted red) around the farm. He was an unexpected guest at the barn-turned-disco in &quot;Saturday Night Shaun&quot;.
*'''The Birds''' make occasional appearances.
*'''She-Shaun/Lola''' is a special guest sheep in &quot;Two's Company&quot;. She is a ewe and Shaun's interest. She became part of the flock after she is mistaken to be sent to her real home.
*'''She-Bitzer''' is a special guest sheepdog in &quot;Fetching&quot;. She is a Bitzer interest. She is leaving the farm because she's one of the unnamed family
*'''The Other Flock''' are minor sheep in &quot;Foxy Laddie&quot;. They are in appearance different than the flock and they become adopted as part of the flock

==== Humans ====
*'''Pizza Delivery Boy''' is a young man who rides a [[moped]] and works in the local [[pizzeria]]. Also [[wiktionary:moonlighting|moonlights]] as a postman in &quot;Saturday Night Shaun&quot;.
*'''The Farmerâs Niece''' is a young girl whose over-enthusiastic love of animals spells trouble for Bitzer and the Flock.
*'''Bus Driver''' takes the sheep to and from the fair in &quot;Sheep on the Loose&quot; and &quot;Takeaway&quot;.
*'''The Granny''' is a short-tempered, short-sighted old lady, appears in &quot;Takeaway&quot; and &quot;Save the Tree&quot;. She also appears in &quot;Two's Company&quot;, holding a cart and &quot;The Big Chase&quot;, forcing the pigs to give her a lift in their car.
*'''The Farmer's Girlfriend''' appears for the first time in Series 2.
''

==== Aliens ====
*'''The Alien Family''' appears in &quot;Shaun Encounters&quot;, consisting of 2 adults and 2 youngsters. They exhibit human-like behaviour and generally jovial personalities. They are green and have one large eye on the top of the head. The mother wears a granny dress while her husband wore a metal shirt.
*'''The Lone Alien''' appears in &quot;The Visitor&quot;. He is similar to the members of the Alien Family but his shirt is similar to the bad children's father. He appears not to originate from Earth, as Shaun has to point out to him on a picture of the solar system, which planet he is currently on. He has a machine that can analyze the characteristics of an animal, including what it likes in life, and which can synthesize objects apparently from thin air.
*'''The Alien Scientists''' Abduct Shaun and Pidsley in &quot;Cat Got Your Brain&quot; (series 2).

== Reception ==
Reviews of the series were consistently positive. Harry Venning of &quot;The Stage&quot; found &quot;characterisation charming and the animation superb. All this before even a mention of how funny and splendidly slapstick the script is.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/16183/tv-review TV Review] The Stage.

The Guardian noted that the series &quot;hits the four-to-seven-year-old age group smack in the eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Banks-Smith, Nancy (6 March 2007). [http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv_and_radio/story/0,,2027294,00.html Last Night's TV]. [[The Guardian]] (UK). Retrieved 3 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the series' parent show Wallace and Gromit, there are many allusions to scenes from movies such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[The Matrix]]'', and ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]''. These include:
* Shirley's training in the episode &quot;Shape Up with Shaun&quot; is based on the film ''[[Rocky]]''.
* The paintings parodied in &quot;Still Life&quot; include the [[Mona Lisa]] and Constable's [[The Hay Wain]].
* In &quot;Buzz Off Bees&quot;, the Farmer appears in his hooded beekeepers outfit, with accompanying [[Darth Vader]]-style heavy breathing.
* The infamous shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's [[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]] is spoofed in the episode &quot;The Little Sheep of Horrors&quot;, whose name is based on the 1960 film ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and its [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|1986 remake]].
* In &quot;Hiccups&quot;, Shaun turns his guitar amplifier up to 11 in a reference to a scene in ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''.
* In &quot;Fleeced&quot;, the Farmer drags one of the sheep away for shearing, slamming a large metal sliding door closed behind him. This is particularly reminiscent of the original ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]''.
** Also in &quot;Fleeced&quot;, the sheep breakout and accompanying music is very reminiscent of British [[World War II]] [[prisoner of war]] films (e.g., ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'')
*In &quot;Supersize Timmy&quot;, when Timmy ate a tomato he becomes big like [[King Kong]].  This is similar to the 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and its [[King Kong (1976 film)|1976]] and [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remakes]].
* In &quot;The Visitor&quot;, the alien thrashes his car with a tree branch in the same way as [[Basil Fawlty]] in ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.
** Also in &quot;The Visitor&quot;, the alien's space ship can use sheep dung as fuel, which resemble [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler's]] faeces in ''[[Futurama]]''.
* In &quot;Mountains out of Molehills&quot; a sheep is reading a magazine called &quot;Bleat&quot;, a spoof of celebrity gossip magazine &quot;[[Heat (magazine)|Heat]]&quot;.
* Near the end of &quot;Off the Baa&quot;, the well-known ''[[Nessun Dorma]]'' theme from [[Puccini]]'s opera [[Turandot]] is used, which was the musical theme of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]].
* At the end of &quot;Mower Mouth&quot; the shrubs are clearly reminiscent of those in ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]''.
* In &quot;Saturday Night Shaun&quot; Shaun rips off his coat and tosses it away as he is dancing, only to have tossed back. This is reminiscent of the scene in the 1980 movie ''[[Airplane!]]'', where [[Robert Hays]] tosses his white sportcoat away, only to have it tossed back in his face.
* In &quot;Mountains out of Molehills&quot; Shaun tries to catch the mole with a fishing rod and line. When the first &quot;bite&quot; is shown, the first two notes of the ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' theme are played.
* in &quot;Party Animals&quot;, one of the guests is dressed as a crude version of a [[Dalek]] trying to get up some stairs but failing because of the suit.
* in &quot;Zebra Ducks of the Serengeti&quot;, the Farmer's signpost over the gate falls over Bitzer - Ã  la Buster Keaton in ''[[Steamboat Bill Jr.]]''

== Video games ==
On 16 June 2008, [[D3 Publisher|D3 Publisher of America]], which published a game based on Aardman's 2006 film ''[[Flushed Away]],'' announced that it would also release a video game based on the television series. The [[Shaun the Sheep (video game)|Shaun the Sheep]] game was developed by [[Art Co., Ltd]] exclusively for [[Nintendo DS]], and was released in autumn 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18932 |title = D3 Announces ''Coraline'' And ''Shaun The Sheep'' Adaptations |accessdate = 2008-06-16 |author = Remo, Chris |date = 2008-06-16 |publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shaun the Sheep'' website also ran a contest which offered five packages containing a Nintendo DS and a copy of the game as a prize.

A second game named [[Shaun the Sheep: Off His Head]] was released in 2009 exclusively in Europe.

The Shaun the Sheep web site is also home to several Flash-based games, including Home Sheep Home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.shaunthesheep.com/games/homesheephome/ |title = Shaun the Sheep Flash game}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also available at the iOS App Store for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/home-sheep-home/id433704428?mt=8 |title = Shaun the Sheep iOS game}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spin-off ==
[[Aardman Animations]] produced a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] show aimed at pre-schoolers based on Timmy, called ''[[Timmy Time]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;licensing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.licensing.biz/brand-profiles/39/Timmy|title=Timmy Tales|last=Loveday|first=Samantha|publisher=Licensing.biz|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, an [[anime]] version was due to commence broadcasting in [[Japan]] October 3, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/anime/shaun/ Main page of the Japanese site for Shaun the Sheep]&lt;/ref&gt;
