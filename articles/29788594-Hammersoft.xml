'''Mystery Scene Magazine''', based in the US and first published in 1985, covers the crime and mystery genre with a mix of articles, profiles, criticism, and extensive reviews of books, films, TV, short stories, audiobooks, and reference works.

==Editorial Focus &amp; Contents==
''Mystery Scene's'' focus is firmly on mystery readers and fans, as opposed to writers or other industry professionals.

Each issue contains commentary, several articles, author profiles, appreciations of particular subgenres or writers, letters to the editor and 150+ reviews of new novels, audiobooks, reference works, kidâs mysteries, short stories, TV shows, films, paperback originals and websites. News items, cartoons, jokes, quotes and anecdotes round out its front-of-the book âHints &amp; Allegationsâ pages.

====Features====
:'''Profiles''' range from best-selling authors, including [[Michael Connelly]], [[Sara Paretsky]], [[Dennis Lehane]], [[Laurie R. King]], [[Ian Rankin]], [[Charlaine Harris]], and [[Lee Child]], to the up-and-coming such as Lisa Lutz, Michael Koryta, Stefanie Pintoff, James R. Benn, and G.M. Malliet.

:'''Articles''' focus on writers (Stuart Neville, Edgar Allan Poe, Daphne du Maurier), characters ([[Trixie Belden]], [[Jack Reacher]]), films and TV shows (âThe Three Maltese Falconsâ, Rockford Files, David Simon, humorous mystery movies), and subgenres (legal thrillers, romantic suspense, crime novels of the Civil Rights era), among other topics.

==History==
'''Mystery Scene Magazine''' was conceived in a phone call&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An Observer's History of Mystery Scene,&quot; Jon L. Breen, Mystery Scene, 2002 Holiday #77. Reprinted in '''A Shot Rang Out: Selected Mystery Criticism''' by Jon L. Breen, Surinam Turtle Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; between [http://www.newimprovedgorman.com/ Ed Gorman], a writer and editor of mystery novels, short stories and anthologies, and [http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/randisi_r.html Robert Randisi], the author of several mystery series, and later the founder and executive director of [http://www.thrillingdetective.com/trivia/triv72.html The Private Eye Writers of America]. Both men felt the need for a magazine that would be to the mystery field what [http://www.locusmag.com/ Locus] was to the science fiction genreânews and views on the genreâs writers and the publishing business. (Over the years, ''Mystery Scene'' has evolved into a reader-centered consumer publication although crime writers still have a strong presence at the magazine.)

The first issue, four pages long, was mailed with the October 1985 issue of '''Mystery &amp; Detective Monthly''', a letterzine published by active mystery fan Robert âCapân Bobâ Napier of Tacoma, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;'''The Heirs of Anthony Boucher: A History of Mystery Fandom''', Marvin Lachman, Poisoned Pen Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 52-page third issue in 1986, the magazine was no longer distributed with the fanzine, and the now-standard mix of interviews, profiles, news notes, obituaries, reviews, letters columns, and opinion pieces was established. A feature in which first novelists introduced their works would eventually be extended to veteran writers who discussed their latest novels.

The first 75 issues of the magazine form a documentary record of developments, concerns, and controversies in the field over this 17-year period. Short stories appeared occasionally as early as âOn Guardâ by John Lutz in #5 (September 1986), but they were never a regular feature.

In 1990 Gormanâs business partner, anthologist Martin H. Greenberg, became a co-publisher, and by April 1991, Randisi, whose participation had gradually decreased, sold his stake in the magazine to Greenberg.

In 2002, owners Ed Gorman and Martin H. Greenberg turned over the reins to Kate Stine, a veteran book and magazine editor in the crime and mystery field, and her husband, Brian Skupin&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kate Stine and Brian Skupin of Mystery Scene Magazine,&quot; by Bonnie J. Cardone, '''InSinc: The Sisters in Crime Newsletter''', Volume XX, Number 1, March 2007.  [[Sisters in Crime]].&lt;/ref&gt;, a long-time mystery fan. Stine became editor-in-chief and handles day-to-day operations while Skupin oversees the website and contributes a regular interview feature. Their first issue, Fall #76 in September 2002, featured a lengthy tribute to outgoing editor and publisher Ed Gorman, &quot;Ed Gorman: Writer, Editor, Mentor,&quot; from his many friends in the mystery community.
