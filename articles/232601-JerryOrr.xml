An '''ensemble cast''' is made up of [[cast member]]s in which the principal [[actor]]s and [[performer]]s are assigned roughly equal amounts of importance and screen time in a dramatic production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Ik9sleNg10kC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | title=Character design for graphic novels | authors=Steven Withrow, Alexander Danner | year=2007 | publisher=[[Focal Press]]/Rotovision | page=112 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of casting became more popular in [[television series]] because it allows flexibility for writers to focus on different characters in different episodes. In addition, the departure of players is less disruptive to the premise than it would be if the star of a production with a regularly structured cast were to leave the series.
