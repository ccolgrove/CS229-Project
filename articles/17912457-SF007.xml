'''XnView''' is a [[cross-platform]] [[image viewer]] used for viewing, converting, organising and editing graphical &amp; video files. It is [[freeware|free of charge]] for private, educational and [[non-profit organisation]]s. For commercial use and distribution, the user must register the program.

It is popular with users as it provides features normally found only in commercial image viewers.

== Features ==
XnView is highly [[customisation|customisable]] and [[multilingualism|multi-lingual]], supporting 44 languages in the Windows version.&lt;ref name=features/&gt; The language can be changed via the options menu. The [[toolbar]] buttons can be modified to a certain extent, or be replaced by altering [[skin (computing)|skins]].

Also, XnView has been able to support an increasing number of file formats (mainly [[image file formats]]). It can read more than 400 image file formats, some [[audio file formats|audio]] and [[container format (digital)|video file formats]], and write 50 image file formats.&lt;ref name=features/&gt; XnView also supports [[ICC profile]]s in [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] and [[TIFF]] files.

XnView can show [[IPTC Information Interchange Model|IPTC]], [[Exif]] and [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] [[metadata]], and write IPTC metadata (but cannot do batch writing of IPTC metadata, and some users are longing for the batch IPTC editing function).&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?t=9014&amp;highlight=iptc XnView :: View topic - Extending IPTC / EXIF / XMP batch editing]&lt;/ref&gt; A further limitation is that it currently does not allow to sort thumbnails within a folder by a user-defined order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?t=12199 XnView :: Voir le sujet - moving files within folder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

XnView can search files that have the same filename or data, and can search for similar graphics as well.

In addition, the display of the [[image histogram|histogram]] of a picture is possible. And within a few [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] clicks, [[scripting language|scripts]] can be created to convert, manipulate and [[batch renaming|rename a batch]] of images in one go.

Several image editing tools are included, for instance color and size manipulation, several [[filter (photography)|filters]] and [[visual effects|effects]] (full version even includes [[Harry's Filters]] 3.0). Lossless (without new encoding) turning, [[flipping]] and [[cropping (image)|cropping]] of JPEG files is supported. Creation of advanced [[slide show]]s is also possible. Furthermore, it can [[upload]] images to an [[FTP]] site or [[ImageShack]], burn images to a [[CD]] or [[DVD]] ([[Nero Burning ROM]] required) with a few clicks (full version only).

The author no longer uses exe compressors to compress executables in the newest version, 1.95, after a long discussion about XnView 1.95 rc1 in the official forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?t=16071&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=0 XnView :: View topic - XnView 1.95 rc1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?t=16142 XnView :: View topic - 1.95: Why did the executable increased so much in size?]&lt;/ref&gt;

XnView is accompanied by NConvert, a [[command line]] image conversion tool.

== Versions ==
[[File:XnView MP.png|thumb|300px|XnView MP on Linux/Ubuntu]]
* '''[http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewforum.php?f=60 XnView MP]'''
XnView MP (XnView Multi Platform) will eventually replace all other versions of XnView (*nix and Mac OS X and Windows) using the same source code for all platforms and is intended to have a unified look and feel. It will have native [[unicode]] support and be able to load full bit depth pictures (8/16/32 bits per component), easier handling of native language support (text based files) and a better database. Currently the newest version is 0.39.

* '''[http://www.xnconvert.com XnConvertMP]'''
XnConvert MP (available on Windows, Linux &amp; MacOSX) allows easy batch conversion of image files, resizing, filtering, adding watermark and more. 

* '''XnView Pocket'''
XnView exists now for [[Pocket PC]] and [[smartphone]] with [[Windows Mobile]] 5 &amp; 6, Pocket PC 2002-2005. Latest version (as of 7 January 2009) is XnView Pocket v1.51.

* ''' XnView Deluxe '''
XnView Deluxe was developed by Pierre-Emmanuel Gougelet for Xzeos Software. It was a commercial version that was more feature rich than the standard free XnView. On January 1., 2006, development, distribution and selling was stopped as a result of increased competition from Adobe Albums among others. The features in the XnView Deluxe were later incorporated into the XnView (free). XnView Deluxe is no longer supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?t=4840 XnView â¢ View topic - Deluxe is dead. Hourra for XnView!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?t=1478 XnView â¢ View topic - What is XnView DeLuxe?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
* XnView does not support [[Unicode]], however the author promises that in v2.0 Unicode will be supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroup.xnview.com/viewtopic.php?t=4135 XnView :: Voir le sujet - Unicode Support Please&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Unicode support exists in XnView MP.

== Reception ==
XnView has received multiple awards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xnview.com/en/awards.html XnView awards]&lt;/ref&gt; including five cows from [[Tucows]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tucows.com/article/1768 Picks: Reviews of programs that convert graphics, work with audio files]. Tucows.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cnet.com]] reports that the XnView has received four out of five stars from both the editors and users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.cnet.com/XnView/3000-2192_4-10067391.html XnView 1.97.8].
