'''Howard Zinn''' (August 24, 1922 â January 27, 2010) was an American [[historian]], academic,  author, playwright, and [[social activist]]. Before and during his tenure as a [[political science]] professor at [[Boston University]] from 1964-88 he wrote more than 20 books, which included his best-selling and influential ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29zinn.html? Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87], January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote extensively about the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â1968)|Civil Rights]] and [[Peace movement|anti-war]] movements, as well as of the [[labor history of the United States]]. His memoir, ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train'', was also the title of a 2004 documentary about Zinn's life and work.&lt;ref name=&quot;HP&quot;&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/27/howard-zinn-dead-author-o_n_439350.html Howard Zinn Dead, Author Of 'People's History Of The United States' Died At 87] by Hillel Italie, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', January 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Zinn was born to a [[Jew]]ish immigrant family in [[Brooklyn]]. His father, Eddie Zinn, born in [[Austria-Hungary]], emigrated to the U.S. with his brother Samuel before the outbreak of World War I. Howard's mother Jenny Zinn immigrated from the Eastern [[Siberia]]n city of [[Irkutsk]].

Both parents were factory workers with limited education when they met and married, and there were no books or magazines in the series of apartments where they raised their children. Zinn's parents introduced him to literature by sending 10 cents plus a coupon to the ''[[New York Post]]'' for each of the 20 volumes of [[Charles Dickens]]' collected works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/barzinn.htm Howard Zinn â One Step Ahead of the Landlord].&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied creative writing at [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Thomas Jefferson High School]] in a special program established by poet Elias Lieberman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2004/apr04/issue/col_howardzinn.html Appel, Jacob M. Chronicling Lives From Spelman College to B.U. ''Education Update'', April 2004].&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
Eager to fight [[fascism]], Zinn joined the [[Army Air Force]] during World War II and was assigned as a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] in the [[490th Bombardment Group]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics of History'' 2nd ed. by Howard Zinn (University of Illinois Press, 1990) pp. 258â274) ISBN 0-252-01673-4.&lt;/ref&gt; bombing targets in [[Berlin]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/v/Ehc3V1g5pm0&amp;rel=1&amp;border=0 |title=Film clip of Zinn |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[anti-war]] stance Zinn developed later was informed, in part, by his experiences. A U.S. bombardier in April 1945, Zinn dropped [[napalm]] bombs on [[Royan#Destruction_of_Royan|Royan]], a seaside resort in southwestern France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zinn |first=Howard |title=Declarations of Independence |year=1990 |publisher=HarperPerennial |location=New York, NY |isbn=0060921080}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

On a post-doctoral research mission nine years later, Zinn visited the resort near [[Bordeaux]] where he interviewed residents, reviewed municipal documents, and read wartime newspaper clippings at the local library. In 1966, Zinn returned to Royan after which he gave his fullest account of that research in his book, ''The Politics of History''. On the ground, Zinn learned that the aerial bombing attacks in which he participated had killed more than 1000 French civilians as well as some German soldiers hiding near Royan to await the war's end, events that are described &quot;in all accounts&quot; he found as ''&quot;une tragique erreur&quot;'' that leveled a small but ancient city and &quot;its population that was, at least officially, friend, not foe.&quot; In ''The Politics of History'', Zinn described how the bombing was orderedâthree weeks before the war in Europe endedâby military officials who were, in part, motivated more by the desire for their own career advancement than in legitimate military objectives. He quotes the official history of the U.S. Army Air Forces' brief reference to the [[Eighth Air Force]] attack on Royan and also, in the same chapter, to the bombing of [[PlzeÅ|Pilsen]] in what was then [[Czechoslovakia]]. The official history stated that the famous [[Å koda Works|Skoda]] works in Pilsen &quot;received 500 well-placed tons,&quot; and that &quot;Because of a warning sent out ahead of time the workers were able to escape, except for five persons.&quot;

Zinn wrote, &quot;I recalled flying on that mission, too, as deputy lead bombardier, and that we did not aim specifically at the 'skoda works' (which I would have noted, because it was the one target in Czechoslovakia I had read about) but dropped our bombs, without much precision, on the city of Pilsen. Two Czech citizens who lived in Pilsen at the time told me, recently, that several hundred people were killed in that raid (that is, Czechs)ânot five.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics of History'' p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinn said his experience as a wartime bombardier, combined with his research into the reasons for, and effects of the bombing of Royan and Pilsen, sensitized him to the ethical dilemmas faced by [[GI (military)|G.I.s]] during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://progressive.org/mag_zinn0106 |title=Interview with Zinn |publisher=Progressive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn questioned the justifications for military operations that inflicted massive civilian casualties during the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombing of cities such as [[Dresden]], Royan, [[Tokyo]], and [[Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in World War II, [[Hanoi]] during the [[War in Vietnam]], and [[Baghdad]] during the war in [[Iraq]] and the civilian casualties during bombings in [[Afghanistan]] during the current and nearly decade old war there. In his pamphlet, ''Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence''&lt;ref&gt;[http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Personal/zinn.html Zinn ''Hiroshima: Breaking the Silence'' by Howard Zinn].&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1995, he laid out the case against targeting civilians with aerial bombing.

Six years later, he wrote: &quot;Recall that in the midst of the [[Gulf War]], the U.S. military bombed an [[Amiriyah shelter massacre|air raid shelter]], killing 400 to 500 men, women, and children who were huddled to escape bombs. The claim was that it was a military target, housing a communications center, but reporters going through the ruins immediately afterward said there was no sign of anything like that. I suggest that the history of bombingâand no one has bombed more than this nationâis a history of endless [[atrocities]], all calmly explained by deceptive and deadly language like 'accident', 'military target', and 'collateral damage{{'&quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/view/2010/01/28-7 &quot;A Just Cause, Not a Just War&quot; ''The Progressive'' December, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
After World War II, Zinn attended [[New York University]] on the [[GI Bill]], graduating with a B.A. in 1951 and [[Columbia University]], where he earned an M.A. (1952) and a Ph.D. in history with a minor in political science (1958). His masters' thesis examined the [[Ludlow massacre|Colorado coal strikes of 1914]].&lt;ref name=&quot;educationupdate2004&quot;&gt;Appel, JM. [http://www.educationupdate.com/archives/2004/apr04/issue/col_howardzinn.html Howard Zinn: Chronicling Lives from Spelman College to Boston U.], April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[doctoral dissertation]] ''LaGuardia in Congress'' was a study of [[Fiorello LaGuardia]]'s congressional career, and it depicted LaGuardia representing &quot;the conscience of the twenties&quot; as LaGuardia fought for public power, the right to strike, and the redistribution of wealth by taxation.&lt;ref name=&quot;educationupdate2004&quot;/&gt; &quot;His specific legislative program,&quot; Zinn wrote, &quot;was an astonishingly accurate preview of the [[New Deal]].&quot; It was published by the [[Cornell University]] Press for the [[American Historical Association]]. ''La Guardia in Congress'' was nominated for the [[American Historical Association]]'s [[Beveridge Award|Beveridge Prize]] as the best English-language book on American history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29zinn.html January 29, 2010 &quot;Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Columbia, his professors included [[Harry Carman]], [[Henry Steele Commager]], and [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]].&lt;ref name=&quot;educationupdate2004&quot;/&gt; But it was Columbia historian [[Richard Hofstadter]]'s ''[[The American Political Tradition]]'' that made the most lasting impression. Zinn regularly included it in his lists of recommended readings, and after [[Barack Obama]] was elected [[President of the United States]], Zinn wrote, &quot;If Richard Hofstadter were adding to his book ''The American Political Tradition'', in which he found both 'conservative' and 'liberal' presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, maintaining for dear life the two critical characteristics of the American system, nationalism and capitalism, Obama would fit the pattern.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socialistworker.org/2008/11/05/what-next-for-the-struggle &quot;What next for struggle in the Obama era?&quot; ''The Socialist Worker'' November 5, 2008, Issue 684].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1960â61, Zinn was a [[post-doctoral]] Fellow in [[East Asian Studies]] at [[Harvard University]].

===Academic career===
{{Quote box 
| quote = &quot;We were not born critical of existing society. There was a moment in our lives (or a month, or a year) when certain facts appeared before us, startled us, and then caused us to question beliefs that were strongly fixed in our consciousness-embedded there by years of family prejudices, orthodox schooling, imbibing of newspapers, radio, and television. This would seem to lead to a simple conclusion: that we all have an enormous responsibility to bring to the attention of others information they do not have, which has the potential of causing them to rethink long-held ideas.&quot;

Zinn was Professor of [[History]] at [[Spelman College]] in Atlanta, Georgia from 1956 to 1963, and Visiting Professor at both the [[University of Paris]] and [[University of Bologna]].

In 1964, Zinn accepted a position at [[Boston University]], after writing two books and participation in the Civil Rights movement in the South.  His classes in [[civil liberties]] were among the most popular at the university with as many as 400 students subscribing each semester to the non-required class. A Professor of [[Political Science]], he taught at BU for 24 years and retired in 1988 at age 64. 

&quot;He had a deep sense of fairness and justice for the underdog. But he always kept his sense of humor. He was a happy warrior,&quot; said Caryl Rivers, [[journalism]] professor at Boston University. Rivers and Zinn were among a group of faculty members who in 1979 defended the right of the school's clerical workers to strike and were threatened with dismissal after refusing to cross a picket line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60R5D020100128 Activist, historian Howard Zinn dies at 87] by Ros Krasny at [[Reuters]] January 28, 2010. Retrieved 2010-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Zinn came to believe that the point of view expressed in traditional history books was often limited. He wrote a history textbook, ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', to provide other perspectives on American history. The textbook depicts the struggles of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] against European and U.S. conquest and expansion, slaves against [[slavery]], unionists and other workers against capitalists, women against [[patriarchy]], and African-Americans for [[civil rights]]. The book was a finalist for the [[National Book Award]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba_winners_finalist_50_07.pdf The National Book Awards Winners &amp; Finalists]. Retrieved 2010-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since the first edition of ''A People's History'' was published in 1980, it has been used as an alternative to standard textbooks in many high school and college history courses, and it is one of the most widely known examples of [[critical pedagogy]]. The ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' stated in 2006 that the book &quot;routinely sells more than 100,000 copies a year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/books/review/30donadio.html &quot;Backlist to the Future&quot;] by Rachel Donadio, July 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Zinn published ''[[Voices of A People's History of the United States]]'' with [[Anthony Arnove]]. ''Voices'' is a sourcebook of speeches, articles, essays, poetry and song lyrics by the people themselves whose stories are told in ''A People's History.'' 

In 2008, the [http://zinnedproject.org Zinn Education Project] was launched to support educators using ''A People's History of the United States'' as a source for middle and high school history. The Project was started when a former student of Zinn, who wanted to bring Zinn's lessons to students around the country, provided the financial backing to allow two other organizations to coordinate the Project. The Project hosts a website that has over 85 free downloadable lesson plans to complement ''A People's History of the United States''.

''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', released in 2010, is a documentary movie inspired by the lives of ordinary people who fought back against oppressive conditions over the course of the history of the United States. The film includes performances by Zinn, [[Matt Damon]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Danny Glover]], [[Marisa Tomei]], [[Don Cheadle]], and [[Sandra Oh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2009/11/03/people-s-history-moves-small-screen |title= People's history moves small screen |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://howardzinn.org/default/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=103&amp;Itemid=55 |title=Howardzinn.org |publisher=howardzinn.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/content/people-speak |title=History channel |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil Rights movement===
From 1956 through 1963, Zinn chaired the department of history and social sciences at [[Spelman College]]. He participated in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â1968)|Civil Rights movement]] and lobbied with historian August Meier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2003may/meier.html |title=Biography of August Meier |publisher=Oah.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;to end the practice of the [[Southern Historical Association]] of holding meetings at [[Racial segregation|segregated]] hotels&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Organization of American Historians]]. Obituary of August Meier, May 2003 by John Bracey [[University of Massachusetts]], [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], [http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2003may/meier.html OAH.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Spelman, Zinn served as an adviser to the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and in 1964, [[Beacon Press]] published his book ''SNCC: The New Abolitionists''. Zinn collaborated with historian [[Staughton Lynd]] mentoring student activists, among them [[Alice Walker]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/01/31/alice_walker_says_goodbye_to_her_friend_howard_zinn/ [[Alice Walker]] remembers Howard Zinn. January 31, 2010 in the Boston Globe].&lt;/ref&gt; who would later write ''[[The Color Purple]]'', and [[Marian Wright Edelman]], founder and president of the [[Children's Defense Fund|Childrenâs Defense Fund]]. Edelman identified Zinn as a major influence in her life and, in that same journal article, tells of his accompanying students to a sit-in at the segregated white section of the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] state legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman, Marian Wright. &quot;Spelman College: A Safe Haven for A Young Black Woman.&quot; ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'', no. 27 (2000): 118â123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Zinn was a tenured professor, he was dismissed in June 1963, after siding with students in the struggle against segregation. As Zinn described&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/19600806/zinn/print &quot;Finishing School for Pickets&quot; By Howard Zinn in ''The Nation'' August 6, 1960].&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]],'' though Spelman administrators prided themselves for turning out refined &quot;young ladies,&quot; its students were likely to be found on the picket line, or in jail for participating in the greater effort to break down segregation in public places in Atlanta. Zinn's years at Spelman are recounted in his autobiography ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train: A Personal History of Our Times.'' His seven years at Spelman College, Zinn said, &quot;are probably the most interesting, exciting, most educational years for me. I learned more from my students than my students learned from me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people/Zinn/zinn-con2.html |title=Interview with Zinn |publisher=Globetrotter.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in Georgia, Zinn wrote that he observed 30 violations of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] amendments to the [[United States Constitution]] in [[Albany, Georgia]], including the rights to [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[equal protection]] under the law. In an article on the civil rights movement in Albany, Zinn described the people who participated in the [[Freedom Rides]] to end segregation, and the reluctance of President [[John F. Kennedy]] to enforce the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/zmag/articles/oldzinn.htm Zmag.org] {{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn has also pointed out that the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] under [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], headed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]], did little or nothing to stop the segregationists from brutalizing civil rights workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediafilter.org/mff/fbi.html |title=Media Filter article on Zinn |publisher=Mediafilter.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zinn wrote about the struggle for civil rights, both as participant and historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reportingcivilrights.org/authors/biblio.jsp?authorId=85 |title=Reporting Civil Rights, Part one: American Journalism 1941â1963 |publisher=The Library of America |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second book, ''The Southern Mystique''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.identitytheory.com/people/birnbaum10.html |title=Intervew with Zinn |publisher=Identitytheory.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1964, the same year as his ''SNCC: The New Abolitionists'' in which he describes how the sit-ins against segregation were initiated by students and, in that sense, were independent of the efforts of the older, more established civil rights organizations.

In 2005, forty-one years after his firing, Zinn returned to Spelman where he was given an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters and gave the commencement address&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exodusnews.com/education/education051.htm |title=Exodus News article on Zinn |publisher=Atlanta Inquirer (Georgia) via Exodusnews.com |date=2005-05-11 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Victoria |last= Brittain |title=Howard Zinn's Lesson To Us All |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 28 January 2010 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jan/28/howard-zinn-america}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he said in part, during his speech titled, &quot;Against Discouragement,&quot; that &quot;The lesson of that history is that you must not despair, that if you are right, and you persist, things will change. The government may try to deceive the people, and the newspapers and television may do the same, but the truth has a way of coming out. The truth has a power greater than a hundred lies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/2728/graduation_day_with_howard_zinn |title=Tomgram: Graduation Day with Howard Zinn |publisher=Tomdispatch.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}} full text of &quot;Against Discouragement.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-war efforts===
Zinn wrote one of the earliest books calling for the U.S. withdrawal from its war in [[Vietnam]]. ''Vietnam: The Logic of Withdrawal'' was published by Beacon Press in 1967 based on his articles in ''[[Commonwealth]]'', ''[[The Nation]],'' and ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]].'' 

In [[Noam Chomsky]]'s view, ''The Logic of Withdrawal'' was Zinn's most important book. &quot;He was the first person to sayâloudly, publicly, very persuasivelyâthat this simply has to stop; we should get out, period, no conditions; we have no right to be there; it's an act of aggression; pull out. It was so surprising at the time that there wasn't even a review of the book. In fact, he asked me if I would review it in ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' just so that people would know about the book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/1/28/howard_zinn_1922_2010_a_tribute Howard Zinn (1922â2010): A Tribute to the Legendary Historian with Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker, Naomi Klein and Anthony Arnove].&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1969, radical historians tried unsuccessfully to persuade the [[American Historical Association]] to pass an anti-Vietnam War resolution. &quot;A debacle unfolded as [[Harvard University|Harvard]] historian (and AHA president in 1968) [[John K. Fairbank|John Fairbank]] literally wrestled the microphone from Zinn's hands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2010/1002/1002tim1.cfm &quot;Forty Years On: Looking Back at the 1969 Annual Meeting&quot;] by Carl Mirra [http://www.adelphi.edu/faculty/profiles/profile.php?PID=0430 February 2010 issue of ''Perspectives on History'' published by the American Historical Association].&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondence by Fairbank, Zinn and other historians, published by the AHA in 1970, is online in what Fairbank called &quot;our briefly-famous Struggle for the Mike&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/1970/7006/7006tim1.cfm From the June 1970 AHA Newsletter &quot;Professional Comment and Controversy: An Open Letter to Howard Zinn&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; 

In later years, Zinn was an adviser to the Disarm Education Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disarm.org/who-we-are/disarm-staff Disarm National Advisory Board]. Retrieved 2010-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vietnam====
Zinn's diplomatic visit to Hanoi with Rev. [[Daniel Berrigan]], during the Tet Offensive in January 1968, resulted in the return of three American airmen, the first American ''POWs'' released by the North Vietnamese since the U.S. bombing of that nation had begun. The event was widely reported in the news media and discussed in a variety of books including ''Who Spoke Up? American Protest Against the War in Vietnam 1963â1975'' by Nancy Zaroulis and Gerald Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Who Spoke Up? American Protest Against the War in Vietnam 1963â1975 |publisher=Horizon Book Promotions |year= 1989 |ISBN=0-385-17547-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn and the Berrigan brothers, Dan and [[Philip Berrigan|Philip]], remained friends and allies over the years.

Also in January 1968, he signed the âWriters and Editors War Tax Protestâ pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the war.&lt;ref&gt;âWriters and Editors War Tax Protestâ January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Daniel Ellsberg]], a former [[RAND]] consultant who had secretly copied ''[[The Pentagon Papers]]'', which described the internal planning and policy decisions of the United States government during the Vietnam War, gave a copy of them to Howard and Roslyn Zinn.&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg autobiography, Zinn autobiography.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Noam Chomsky]], Zinn edited and annotated the copy of ''The Pentagon Papers'' that Ellsberg entrusted to him. Zinn's longtime publisher, Beacon Press, published what has come to be known as the Senator [[Mike Gravel]] edition of ''The Pentagon Papers,'' four volumes plus a fifth volume with analysis by Chomsky and Zinn.

At Ellsberg's criminal trial for theft, conspiracy, and espionage in connection with the publication of the ''Pentagon Papers'' by ''The [[New York Times]]'', defense attorneys called Zinn as an expert witness to explain to the jury the history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam from World War II to 1963. Zinn discussed that history for several hours, later reflecting on his time before the jury. &quot;I explained there was nothing in the papers of military significance that could be used to harm the defense of the United States, that the information in them was simply embarrassing to our government because what was revealed, in the government's own interoffice memos, was how it had lied to the American public. The secrets disclosed in the Pentagon Papers might embarrass politicians, might hurt the profits of corporations wanting tin, rubber, oil, in far-off places. But this was not the same as hurting the nation, the people,&quot; Zinn wrote in his autobiography. Most of the jurors later said that they voted for acquittal.

Nixon|Nixon]] administration's [[Daniel Ellsberg#Fielding break-in|burglary of the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist]].

Zinn's testimony as to the motivation for government secrecy was confirmed in 1989 by [[Erwin Griswold]], who as U.S. solicitor general during the Nixon administration, prosecuted ''The New York Times'' in the Pentagon Papers case in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-op-blanton21may21,0,1992884.story |title=The lie behind the secrets |author=Blanton, Tom |date=2006-05-21 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2008-01-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griswold persuaded three Supreme Court justices to vote to stop ''The New York Times'' from continuing to publish the Pentagon Papers, an order known as &quot;prior restraint&quot; that has been held to be illegal under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]]. The papers were simultaneously published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', effectively nulling the effect of the prior restraint order. In 1989, Griswold admitted that there was no national security damage resulting from the publication of the papers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; In a column in the ''Washington Post'', Griswold wrote: &quot;It quickly becomes apparent to any person who has considerable experience with classified material that there is massive over classification and that the principal concern of the classifiers is not with national security, but with governmental embarrassment of one sort or another.&quot;

Zinn supported the G.I. antiwar movement during the U.S. war in Vietnam. In the 2001 film ''[[Unfinished Symphony]]'', Zinn provides a historical context for the 1971 antiwar march by [[Vietnam Veterans against the War]]. The marchers traveled from [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Massachusetts]], to [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]], &quot;which retraced [[Paul Revere]]'s ride of 1775 and ended in the massive arrest of 410 veterans and civilians by the Lexington police.&quot; The film depicts &quot;scenes from the 1971 Winter Soldier hearings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Winter Soldier Investigation |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which former G.I.s testified, with little to no actual evidence, about &quot;atrocities&quot; they either participated in or said they had  witnessed committed by U.S. forces in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chss.montclair.edu/english/furr/unfinished.pdf Cineaste] pp. 91, 96.

====Iraq====
[[File:Howard Zinn.jpg|220px|thumb|right|Howard Zinn speaking at [[Marlboro College]] February 2004]]

Zinn opposed the invasion and occupation of Iraq and wrote several books about it. He asserted that the U.S. would end its war with an occupation of Iraq when resistance within the military increased in the same way resistance within the military contributed to ending the U.S. war in Vietnam. He compared the demand by a growing number of contemporary U.S. military families to end the war in Iraq to parallel demands &quot;in the Confederacy in the Civil War, when the wives of soldiers rioted because their husbands were dying and the plantation owners were profiting from the sale of cotton, refusing to grow grains for civilians to eat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomdispatch.com/index.mhtml?emx=x&amp;pid=20715 Interview with Zinn].&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn argued that &quot;There is no flag large enough to cover the shame of killing innocent people for a purpose which is unattainable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Zinn/Tripoli_ZR.html |title=Terrorism Over Tripoli from ''Zinn Reader'', Seven Stories Press (1993) excerpted online |publisher=Thirdworldtraveler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Christophe Agnew, Professor of History and American Studies at [[Yale University]], told the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' in May 2007 that Zinnâs historical work is &quot;highly influential and widely used&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/21049 |title=Zinn calls for activism |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016182602/http://yaledailynews.com/articles/view/21049 |archivedate = October 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that it is not unusual for prominent professors such as Zinn to weigh in on current events, citing a resolution opposing the war in Iraq that was recently ratified by the [[American Historical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.historians.org/news/166/iraq-war-resolution-is-ratified-by-aha-members |title=American Historical Association Blog: Iraq War Resolution is Ratified by AHA Members |publisher=Blog.historians.org |date=2007-03-12 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agnew added: &quot;In these moments of crisis, when the country is splitâso historians are split&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Yu |first=Lea |url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/05/04/963/ |title=Historian Howard Zinn Calls for Activism â CommonDreams.org |publisher=CommonDreams.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialism===
Zinn described himself as &quot;Something of an [[Anarchism|anarchist]], something of a [[Socialism|socialist]]. Maybe a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/ias/13zinn.htm &quot;War is the Health of the State: An Interview with Howard Zinn&quot;], By Paul Glavin &amp; Chuck Morse, ''Perspectives on Anarchist Theory'', Vol. 7, No. 1, Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested looking at socialism in its full historical context as a popular, positive idea that got a bad name from its association with Soviet Communism. In [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in 2009, Zinn said:
{{Quote|Let's talk about socialism. I think it's very important to bring back the idea of socialism into the national discussion to where it was at the turn of the [last] century before the Soviet Union gave it a bad name. Socialism had a good name in this country. Socialism had [[Eugene Debs]]. It had [[Clarence Darrow]]. It had [[Mary Harris Jones|Mother Jones]]. It had [[Emma Goldman]]. It had several million people reading socialist newspapers around the country. Socialism basically said, hey, let's have a kinder, gentler society. Let's share things. Let's have an economic system that produces things not because they're profitable for some corporation, but produces things that people need. People should not be retreating from the word socialism because you have to go beyond capitalism.&lt;ref name = &quot;ZirinHP&quot;&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dave-zirin/howard-zinn-the-historian_b_439757.html Howard Zinn: The Historian Who Made History] by [[Dave Zirin]], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', January 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===FBI files===
Due to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request, on July 30, 2010, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) released a file with 423 pages of information on Howard Zinnâs life and activities. During the height of [[McCarthyism]] in 1949, the FBI first opened a domestic security investigation on Zinn (FBI File # 100-360217), based on Zinnâs activities in what the agency considered to be communist [[front groups]] and informant reports that Zinn was an active member of the [[Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA).&lt;ref name = &quot;Progress&quot;&gt;[http://progressive.org/node/146176/14010 The FBIâs File on Howard Zinn] by Matthew Rothschild, ''[[The Progressive]]'', July 31, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Zinn denied ever being a member and said that he had participated in the activities of various organizations which might be considered Communist fronts but that his participation was motivated by his belief that in this country people had the right to believe, think, and act according to their own ideals.&lt;ref name = &quot;Progress&quot; /&gt;

Later in the 1960s, as a result of Zinnâs campaigning against the [[Vietnam War]] and his influence on [[Martin Luther King]], the FBI designated Zinn a high security risk to the country, a category that allowed them to summarily arrest him if a [[state of emergency]] were to be declared.&lt;ref name = &quot;Progress&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/zinn_howard.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI memos also show that they were concerned with Zinnâs repeated criticism of the FBI for failing to protect blacks against white mob violence. Zinn's daughter said she was not surprised by the files; &quot;He always knew they had a file on him&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Progress&quot; /&gt;

==Death==
Zinn was swimming in a hotel pool when he died of an apparent [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/29/us/29zinn.html &quot;Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87&quot; ''The New York Times'' January 29, 2010].&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Santa Monica, California]] on 27 January, 2010. He had been scheduled to speak at the [[Santa Monica Museum of Art]] for an event titled &quot;A Collection of Ideas... [[the People Speak]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-howard-zinn28-2010jan28,0,5610858.story Howard Zinn dies at 87; author of best-selling ''People's History of the United States'': Activist collapsed in Santa Monica, where he was scheduled to deliver a lecture.] by Robert J. Lopez, January 28, 2010. Retrieved 2010-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of his last interviews&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigthink.com/howardzinn/ Howard Zinn video in nine parts].&lt;/ref&gt;
he said he'd like to be remembered &quot;for introducing a different way of thinking about the world, about war, about human rights, about equality,&quot; and &quot;for getting more people to realize that the power which rests so far in the hands of people with wealth and guns, that the power ultimately rests in people themselves and that they can use it. At certain points in history, they have used it. Black people in the South used it. People in the women's movement used it. People in the anti-war movement used it. People in other countries who have overthrown tyrannies have used it.&quot;

He said he wanted to be known as &quot;somebody who gave people a feeling of hope and power that they didn't have before&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commondreams.org/video/2010/01/29-2 Howard Zinn: How I Want to Be Remembered].&lt;/ref&gt;
