'''FFmpeg''' is a [[free software]] project that produces [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and [[Computer program|programs]] for handling [[multimedia]] data. The most notable parts of FFmpeg are '''[[libavcodec]]''', an audio/video [[codec]] library used by several other projects, '''libavformat''', an audio/video [[Container format (digital)|container]] [[multiplexing|mux and demux]] library, and the '''ffmpeg''' [[command line]] program for [[transcoding]] multimedia files.
FFmpeg is published under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] 2.1+ or [[GNU General Public License]] 2+ (depending on which options are enabled).&lt;ref name=&quot;legal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html |title=FFmpeg License and Legal Considerations |publisher=ffmpeg.org |accessdate=27 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The project was started by [[Fabrice Bellard]]&lt;ref name=&quot;legal&quot; /&gt; (using the [[pseudonym]] âGerard Lantau&quot;), and has been maintained by Michael Niedermayer since 2004. Many FFmpeg developers are also part of the [[MPlayer]] project. The name of the project comes from the [[MPEG]] video standards group, together with &quot;FF&quot; for &quot;fast forward&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FFmpeg naming and logo | url = http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-devel/2006-February/007707.html | first = Fabrice | last = Bellard | work = FFmpeg developer mailing list | publisher = Mplayer website | date = 18 February 2006 | accessdate = 29 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo uses a [[zigzag]] pattern that shows how MPEG video codecs handle [[entropy encoding]].

FFmpeg is developed under [[GNU]]/[[Linux]], but it can be compiled under most [[operating system]]s, including [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[AmigaOS]] and its heir [[MorphOS]]. Most [[computing platform]]s and [[microprocessor]] [[instruction set architectures]] are also supported, like [[x86]] ([[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]]), [[PowerPC|PPC (PowerPC)]], [[ARM family|ARM]], [[DEC Alpha]], [[SPARC]], and [[MIPS architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fate.multimedia.cx/ FFmpeg Automated Testing Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

FFmpeg version 0.5 appeared after a long time without formal releases. FFmpeg developers still always recommend using the latest [[neutral build]] from their [[source code]] [[Git (software)|Git]] [[version control system]].

There are two [[video codec]]s and one [[video container]] invented in the FFmpeg project during its development. The two video codecs are the lossless &quot;[[FFV1]]&quot;, and the lossless and lossy &quot;[[snow (codec)|Snow codec]]&quot;, the development of which has stalled, while its bitstream format hasn't been finalized yet, making it experimental for now (February 2011), and the multimedia container is &quot;[[NUT Container|NUT]]&quot; which is also not being actively developed anymore, but is still maintained.

On June 17, 2010, with version 0.6 FFmpeg also supports [[WebM]] and [[VP8]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newteevee.com/2010/06/17/ffmpeg-goes-webm-enabling-vp8-for-boxee-co/ Jun. 17, 2010, newteevee.com: FFmpeg Goes WebM, Enabling VP8 for Boxee &amp; Co.] Quote: &quot;...with [[VLC]], [[Boxee]], [[MythTV]], [[HandBrake|Handbrake]] and [[MPlayer]] being some of the more popular projects utilizing FFmpeg...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, 2010 Jason Garrett-Glaser, Ronald Bultje, and David Conrad of the FFmpeg Team announced the ffvp8 decoder. Through testing they determined that ffvp8 was faster than Google's own libvpx decoder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://x264dev.multimedia.cx/?p=499 |title=Diary Of An x264 Developer: Announcing the worldâs fastest VP8 decoder }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.slashdot.org/story/10/07/24/1227241/FFmpeg-Announces-High-Performance-VP8-Decoder?from=rss| Slashdot: FFmpeg Announces High-Performance VP8 Decoder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 13, 2011 a group of FFmpeg developers decided to fork the project under the name Libav.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.libav.org/| Libav project site}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.devel/129579| [ANN] Project renamed to Libav}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTIwNw| A Group Of FFmpeg Developers Just Forked As Libav}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event seems related to a recent issue in project management.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/423702/| FFMpeg turmoil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the maintainer of [[Debian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624807|transition: Libav 0.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/transitions/libav.html|Ubuntu Release Management: Transition: &quot;libav&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; packages has switched them to the fork.

==Components==
The project is made of several components:
* FFmpeg
** ''ffmpeg'' is a command line tool to convert one video file format to another. It can also grab and encode in real time from a TV card.
** ''ffserver'' is an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and [[Real Time Streaming Protocol|RTSP]] multimedia streaming server for live broadcasts. It can also time shift live broadcast.
** ''ffplay'' is a simple media player based on [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]] and on the FFmpeg libraries.
** ''ffprobe'' is a command line tool to show media information.
* Libav
** ''avconv'' is based on ffmpeg command line tool, but has api differences
** ''avserver'' is a renamed ffserver
** ''avplay'' is a renamed ffplay
** ''avprobe'' is a renamed ffprobe
* ''[[libavcodec]]'' is a library containing all the FFmpeg audio/video encoders and decoders. Most codecs were developed from scratch to ensure best performance and high code reusability.
* ''libavformat'' is a library containing demuxers and muxers for audio/video container formats.
* ''libavutil'' is a helper library containing routines common to different parts of FFmpeg. This library includes [[Adler-32|adler32]], [[Cyclic redundancy check|crc]], [[MD5|md5]], [[SHA-1|sha1]], [[Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer|lzo]] decompressor, [[Base64]] encoder/decoder, [[Data Encryption Standard|des]] encrypter/decrypter, [[RC4|rc4]] encrypter/decrypter and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|aes]] encrypter/decrypter.
* ''libpostproc'' is a library containing [[video postprocessing]] routines.
* ''libswscale'' is a library containing video [[image scaling]] and [[Color space|colorspace]]/pixelformat conversion routines.
* ''libavfilter'' is the substitute for vhook which allows the video/audio to be modified or examined between the decoder and the encoder.
* ''libswresample'' is a library containing audio [[Resampling_(audio)|resampling]] routines.

==Projects using FFmpeg==
FFmpeg is used by many open source (and proprietary) projects, including ffmpeg2theora, [[VLC media player|VLC]], [[MPlayer]], [[HandBrake]], [[Blender (software)|Blender]], [[Google Chrome]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://ffmpeg.org/projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

FFmpeg handles the [[HTML5]] Video and Audio media content in the [[Origyn Web Browser]] for [[MorphOS]] Operating System.&lt;ref name=mosport&gt;{{cite web | title = Origyn Web Browser for MorphOS | url = http://fabportnawak.free.fr/owb/ | publisher = Fabian Coeurjoly | accessdate= 2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OWB_html5&gt;{{cite web | title = Origyn Web Browser 1.7 Supports HTML5 Media, More | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/22971/Origyn_Web_Browser_1_7_Supports_HTML5_Media_More | publisher = OSNews | author = Thom Holwerda | date = March 8, 2010 | accessdate= 2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[graphical user interfaces]] for FFmpeg have been developed, including Avanti,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avanti: FFmpeg/Avisynth GUI|url=http://avanti.arrozcru.com/ |accessdate= 2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WinFF is a GUI to the command line video converter FFmpeg |url=http://code.google.com/p/winff/ |accessdate= 2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Miro Media Player|Miro Video Converter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Multimedia frameworks using FFmpeg==
* [[DirectShow]]/[[Video for Windows|VFW]]
** [[ffdshow]] (external project)
* [[QuickTime]]
** [[Perian]] (external project)

* [[OpenMAX]]

==Legal status of codecs==
FFmpeg contains more than 100 codecs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Codecs list | url = http://ffmpeg.org/general.html#SEC8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which do not just store uncompressed data. At least all codecs that compress information could be claimed by patent holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Legal information on FFmpeg's website | url = http://ffmpeg.org/legal.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such claims may be enforceable in countries like the United States which have implemented [[software patent]]s, but are considered unenforceable or void in countries that have not implemented software patents. Furthermore, many of these codecs are only released under terms that forbid reverse engineering, even for purposes of interoperability. These terms of use are forbidden in certain countries. For example, some [[European Union]] nations have not implemented software patents and have laws expressly allowing [[reverse engineering]] for purposes of interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |publisher=[[Directive on the legal protection of computer programs|Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most GNU/Linux distributions include a stripped version of FFmpeg only including
certain codecs to avoid legal complications, instead contributors maintain unofficial repositories containing such software.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.opensuse.org/Restricted_formats&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats&lt;/ref&gt;
