'''Diskeeper''' is a [[file system fragmentation]] program for [[Microsoft Windows]], developed by [[Diskeeper Corporation]] (formerly Executive Software).

==History==
Originally, Diskeeper was developed for the [[VAX]] series of [[minicomputer]]s{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and later for Microsoft Windows. The defragmentation program which is included with [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] is based on a basic version of Diskeeper.&lt;ref name=windowsxp&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate=5 November 2007
 |quote=The Disk Defragmenter tool is based on the full retail version of Diskeeper by Executive Software International, Inc.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
In addition to resolving file system fragmentation, Diskeeper also prevents fragmentation before it happens by optimizing the process of data being written to disk.&lt;ref name=intelliwrite&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate = 30 December 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diskeeper can also defragment of files on-the-fly, using only idle system [[resource (computer science)|resources]] as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

 |accessdate = 30 December 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature in Diskeeper is I-FAAST, or ''Intelligent File Access Acceleration Sequencing Technology''. I-FAAST determines the frequency of file usage and the most frequently used files are then moved to the best portion of the disc. According to Diskeeper, this results in faster file access and also helps prevent future fragmentation of those files.  The I-FAAST feature is available in Professional, Pro Premier and Server editions.&lt;ref name=i-faast&gt;{{Cite web

There are six versions available: ''Home'', ''Professional'', ''Pro Premier''&lt;!-- Not a typo! --&gt;, ''HomeServer''&lt;!-- Not a typo! --&gt;, ''Server'', and ''EnterpriseServer''&lt;!-- Not a typo! --&gt;. Diskeeper Administrator is also available to manage Diskeeper options as well as perform advanced installations. Version 10 was the last version available for [[Windows 9x]]. After version 10, Diskeeper versions follow the year based naming convention, that is, 2007, 2008 and so on.

==Critical reception ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}
Diskeeper 2009 won ''Editor's Best Gold award'' and ''Community's Choice Bronze award'' for best system utility of 2009 from Windows IT Pro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Controversy==
{{Details|1=Diskeeper Corporation#Scientology and Diskeeper}}
The inclusion of the Diskeeper utility in [[Windows 2000]] was the subject of a [[Scientology]] related&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/10/scientology_friends_dc/index.html The Church of Scientology's friends in Washington] at [[Salon.com]], 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; controversy in Germany. Before endorsing Windows 2000 for use on German government servers, the Federal Office of Security in Information Technology (BSI) demanded Microsoft to allow them to examine source code to determine that the software was not secretly monitoring and transmitting user data. The controversy was resolved when Microsoft published a utility that allowed users to remove Diskeeper if they chose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
