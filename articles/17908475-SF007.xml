'''''The Adventures of Tintin''''' (also known as '''''The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn'''''&lt;ref name=&quot;BBFC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/AFF279229/|title=THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN - THE SECRET OF THE UNICORN|publisher=BBFC|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a 2011 American [[performance capture]] [[3D film]] based on ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', a series of comic books created by [[Belgium|Belgian]] artist [[HergÃ©|HergÃ© (Georges Remi)]]. Directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], produced by [[Peter Jackson]], and written by [[Steven Moffat]], [[Edgar Wright]] and [[Joe Cornish (comedian)|Joe Cornish]], the film is based on three of the original comic books: ''[[The Crab with the Golden Claws]]'' (1941), ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]'' (1943), and ''[[Red Rackham's Treasure]]'' (1944).&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;

Spielberg first acquired rights to produce a film based upon the ''Adventures of Tintin'' series following HergÃ©'s death in 1983, and re-optioned them in 2002. Filming was due to begin in October 2008 for a 2010 release, but release was delayed to 2011 after [[Universal Studios|Universal]] opted out of producing the film with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], who provided $30&amp;nbsp;million on pre-production. [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] chose to co-produce the films. The delay resulted in [[Thomas Sangster]], who had been cast as Tintin, departing from the project. Producer Peter Jackson, whose company [[Weta Digital]] is providing the [[computer animation]], intends to direct a sequel. Spielberg and Jackson also hope to co-direct a third film.&lt;ref name=raiders/&gt;

The first press-screening was held on October 10, 2011 and the world premiÃ¨re took place on October 22, 2011 in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tintin Has World Premiere In His Hometown|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=141619935|accessdate=2011-10-22|newspaper=NPR|date=2011-10-22|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film is set to be released in North American theaters on December 21, 2011 in [[Digital 3D]] and [[IMAX 3D|IMAX]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reldates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us.movie.tintin.com |title=The Adventures of Tintin Official Movie Site |publisher=Paramount Pictures |accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release date in Australia is 26 December.

== Plot ==
Tintin, a young journalist, and his dog Snowy are browsing in an outdoor market in a European town. Tintin buys a model of a three-masted sailing ship, the [[Unicorn (ship)|Unicorn]], on the cheap, but is then immediately accosted by the sinister [[Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine]], and the mysterious figure of Barnaby, who both try to buy the model from Tintin, without success. Tintin takes the ship home, but it is broken during a fight between Snowy and a neighbour's cat. As it breaks, a parchment scroll slips out of the ship's mast. Snowy spots it but is unable to alert Tintin. Meanwhile, incompetent detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of a pickpocket, [[Aristides Silk]]. Tintin visits Sakharine in [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he learns that there are at least two model ships.

Later, Tintin is shot at, then abducted by accomplices of Sakharine, and imprisoned on the SS Karaboudjan. On board, Tintin escapes and meets the ship's nominal captain, Haddock. Haddock has been supplied with whisky by first mate Allan, who is working for Sakharine, and the captain is permanently drunk, and doesn't know what's happening on board his ship. Tintin and Haddock (and Snowy) eventually escape from the Karaboudjan in a lifeboat. Sakharine sends a [[seaplane]] to find them, but Tintin is able to capture the plane, and fly towards the (fictitious) Moroccan port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but they crash in the desert.

Dehydrated in the heat, and suffering from a sudden lack of alcohol, Haddock hallucinates, and starts to remember stories about his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock(e), who was captain of the Unicorn during the 17th century. Sir Francis' treasure-laden ship was attacked by a pirate ship, led by the masked [[Red Rackham]], and, after a fierce battle and eventual surrender, Sir Francis chose to sink the Unicorn, and most of the treasure, rather than allow it to fall into Rackham's hands. It transpires that there were three models of the Unicorn, each containing a scroll. Together, the scrolls will reveal the location of the sunken Unicorn, and its treasure.

In Bagghar, Tintin and the Captain find out that the third model ship is in the possession of the wealthy [[Omar Ben Salaad]], but it is encased in a bullet-proof glass display case. Sakharine's plan is to stage a concert involving famous diva [[Bianca Castafiore]], the &quot;Milanese nightingale&quot;, whose penetrating singing voice will be able to shatter the glass case, allowing Sakharine's trained hawk to fly down and steal the third scroll. After a chase down to the harbour, pursued by Tintin and Haddock, Sakharine finally escapes with all three scrolls. Tintin chases him back to Europe and arranges a police reception for him on the dockside. Haddock and Sakharine, who is revealed to be the descendant of Red Rackham, replay their ancestors' swashbuckling sword fight, using dockside cranes, and Haddock is eventually victorious.

With the three scrolls in their possession, Tintin and Haddock find that the indicated location is Marlinspike Hall, and that the hall had been built originally by Sir Francis Haddock. There, in the cellar, they find some of the treasure, and a clue to the location of the sunken Unicorn.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Spielberg has been an avid fan of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' comic books, which he discovered in 1981 when a review compared ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' to Tintin. His secretary bought him French-language editions of each book, but Spielberg did not have to understand them: he immediately fell in love with its art.&lt;ref name=raiders&gt;{{cite news | author=Ruben V. Nepales | title = Spielberg may co-direct next with Peter Jackson | work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | date = May 18, 2008 | url = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20080518-137261/Spielberg-may-co-direct-next-with-Peter-Jackson | accessdate=May 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the comics' creator [[HergÃ©]], who didn't like the previous live action film versions and the [[HergÃ©'s Adventures of Tintin|cartoon]], became a fan of Spielberg. [[Michael Farr]], author of ''Tintin: The Complete Companion'', recalled HergÃ© &quot;thought Spielberg was the only person who could ever do Tintin justice&quot;.&lt;ref name=moguls&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeff Dawson|title=Tintin and the Movie Moguls?|work=The Sunday Times |location=UK|date=May 27, 2007|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article1830463.ece|accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg and his production partner [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] of [[Amblin Entertainment]] were scheduled to meet with HergÃ© in 1983 while filming ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' in London. HergÃ© died that week, but his widow decided to give them the rights.&lt;ref name=raiders/&gt; A three-year long option to film the comics was finalized in 1984,&lt;ref name=moguls/&gt; with Universal as distributor.&lt;ref name=uni/&gt;

Spielberg commissioned ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' writer [[Melissa Mathison]] to script a film where Tintin battles [[ivory]] hunters in Africa.&lt;ref name=moguls/&gt; Spielberg saw Tintin as &quot;[[Indiana Jones]] for kids&quot; and wanted [[Jack Nicholson]] to play Haddock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2008/dec/29/culture-briefs-88727919/|work=The Washington Times |title=Culture Briefs|date=December 29, 2008|accessdate=December 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsatisfied with the script, Spielberg continued with production on ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. The rights returned to the [[HergÃ© Foundation]]. [[Claude Berri]] and [[Roman Polanski]] became interested in filming the property, while [[Warner Bros.]] negotiated long and hard for the rights, but they could not guarantee the &quot;creative integrity&quot; that the Foundation found in Spielberg.&lt;ref name=moguls/&gt; In 2001, Spielberg revealed his interest in depicting Tintin with [[computer animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Davidson|title=Enfin, a Tintin Movie|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 29, 2001|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/305/305331p1.html|accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, his studio [[DreamWorks]] reestablished the option to film the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tintin 'to become movie hero' |work=BBC News Online | date = November 22, 2002 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2502495.stm | accessdate=October 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg said he would just produce the film.&lt;ref name=age&gt;{{cite news | author=Steve Head | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/380/380514p1.html | title = An Interview with Steven Spielberg | work=[[IGN]] | date = December 17, 2002 | accessdate = June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the French magazine ''[[Capital (French magazine)|Capital]]'' reported Spielberg was intending a trilogy based on ''Secret of the Unicorn'' / ''Red Rackham's Treasure'', ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'' / ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]'' and ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'' / ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'' (which are not a single story, but both feature the [[Chang Chong-Chen]] character).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Davidson|title=Spielberg Planning Tintin Trilogy?|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 14, 2004|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/463/463162p1.html|accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Spielberg had reverted to his idea of a live-action adaptation, and called [[Peter Jackson]] to ask if [[Weta Digital]] would create a computer-generated Snowy.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite news|title=News Etc.|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=June 2009|pages=20â25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson was present for the first week of filming and supervised the rest of the shoot via a bespoke [[videoconferencing]] program.&lt;ref name=back/&gt; Simon Pegg said Jackson's voice would &quot;be coming over the [[Tannoy]] like God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nick Setchfield|title=Simon Pegg Exclusive|work=[[SFX magazine]]|date=April 1, 2009|url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/page/sfx?entry=simon_pegg_exclusive|accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming, various directors including [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Stephen Daldry]] and [[David Fincher]] visited. Spielberg would try to treat the film like live-action, moving his camera around.&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; He revealed, &quot;Every movie I made, up until ''Tintin'', I always kept one eye closed when I've been framing a shot,&quot; because he wanted to see the movie in 2-D, the way viewers would. &quot;On ''Tintin'', I have both of my eyes open.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Josh Quittner]]|title=3-D: The Future of Movies|work=TIME|date=March 19, 2009|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1886541-2,00.html|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson took the hands-on approach to directing Weta Digital during post-production, which Spielberg supervised through video conferencing.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception===
The film currently scores 86% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film review aggregate site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 16, 2011|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_adventures_of_tintin/|title=The Adventures of Tintin (2011)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]''{{'}}s film critics Daniel Couvreur and Nicolas Crousse called the film &quot;a great popular adventure movie&quot;, stating &quot;[the film's] enthusiasm and childhood spirit are unreservedly infectious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On a vu Tintin : un grand film d'aventures populaire.|url=http://www.lesoir.be/culture/cinema/2011-10-11/on-a-vu-tintin-un-grand-film-d-aventures-populaire-869135.php|publisher=Le Soir|accessdate=October 11, 2011|author=Daniel Couvreur|coauthors=Nicolas Crousse|language=French|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Le Figaro]]'' praised the film &quot;[which is] crammed with action, humor and suspense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delcroix|first=Olivier|title=On a vu Tintin, &quot;un grand ouf de soulagement&quot;|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/cinema/2011/10/12/03002-20111012ARTFIG00467-on-a-vu-tintin-un-grand-ouf-de-soulagement.php|publisher=Le Figaro|accessdate=October 12, 2011|language=French|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Mintzer of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' was also very positive about the film, describing it as &quot;a good ol' fashioned adventure flick that harkens back to the filmmaker's action-packed, tongue-in-cheek swashbucklers of the 1980s. Steven Spielberg's ''The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn'' is a visually dazzling adaptation.&quot;. Comparing it to another film, Mintzer said ''Tintin'' has &quot;an altogether more successful [[Motion capture|mocap]] experience than earlier efforts like ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mintzer|first=Jordan|title=The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn: Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/spielberg-adventures-tintin-secret-unicorn-film-249116|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=October 17, 2011|date=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] wrote &quot;Clearly rejuvenated by his collaboration with producer Peter Jackson, and blessed with a smart script and the best craftsmanship money can buy, Spielberg has fashioned a whiz-bang thrill ride that's largely faithful to the wholesome spirit of his source but still appealing to younger, Tintin-challenged [[Audience|auds]].&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Felperin|first=Leslie|title=Film reviews - The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117946357/|work=Variety|accessdate=October 17, 2011|date=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[La Libre Belgique]]'' was, however, a little less enthusiastic, its film critic Alain LorfÃ¨vre calling the film &quot;a technical success, [with] a Tintin vivid as it should be [and] a somewhat excessive Haddock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;la libre&quot; /&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Xan Brooks gave the film two stars out of five, stating: &quot;while the big set pieces are often exuberantly handled, the human details are sorely wanting. How curious that HergÃ© achieved more expression with his use of ink-spot eyes and humble line drawings than a bank of computers and an army of animators were able to achieve.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Adventures of Tintin: Review|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/oct/16/tintin-adventures-secret-of-unicorn|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blog Critics]]'' writer Ross Miller said, &quot;author HergÃ©'s wonderfully bold and diverse array of characters are a mixed bag when it comes to how they've been translated to the big-screen&quot; and that while the mystery might be &quot;perfectly serviceable&quot; for the film, &quot;the execution of it at times feels languid and stodgy, like it's stumbling along from one eye-catching setpiece to the next.&quot; However, he summed it up as, &quot;an enjoyable watch with some spectacular set-pieces, lavish visuals and some fine motion-capture performances.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Review: The Adventures of Tintin|url=http://blogcritics.org/video/article/movie-review-the-adventures-of-tintin/|publisher=BlogCritics|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of a study of the Tintin books described Hollywood's treatment in this film of its characters and stories as &quot;truly execrable&quot;, especially in the way it ignores the books' key idea of inauthenticity. The themes of fakeness and phoniness and counterfeit that drive  many of the original plots are replaced in the film with messages that feel &quot;as though we have wandered into a seminar on monetisation through self-empowerment ... It's like making a biopic of Nietzsche that depicts him as a born-again Christian, or of Gandhi as a trigger-happy Rambo blasting his way through the Raj.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCarthy|first=Tom|title=Tintin gets the Hollywood treatment|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/tintin-gets-the-hollywood-treatment-20111031-1mrvy.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2011-11- 01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
The film received two nominations for the [[Satellite Awards]] for [[Satellite Award for Best Animated or Mixed Media Feature|Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media]] and [[Satellite Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pressacademy.com/award_cat/current-nominees/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
Depending on the film's success, two more Tintin movies could be produced. The first of these was originally planned to be based on ''[[The Seven Crystal Balls]]'' and ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;sequel mtv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wigler|first=Josh|title=Jackson To Direct âTintinâ Sequel|url=http://movienight.mtv.ca/2011/10/peter-jackson-will-direct-tintin-sequel/|publisher=MTV|accessdate=October 26, 2011|date=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however screenwriter [[Anthony Horowitz]] has since called this into question, suggesting these films would be the second sequel and another story would become the first sequel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tintin 2: Horowitz says story 'still under discussion'&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Tim|first=Masters|title=Tintin 2: Horowitz says story 'still under discussion'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15553417|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 November, 2011|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jackson also confirmed he will direct it once he has finished [[The Hobbit (2012 film)|''The Hobbit'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;sequel mtv&quot; /&gt; The second would be co-directed by Jackson and Spielberg. However, regarding those rumours Spielberg stated they had not talked about that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spielberg &amp; Jackson up for Tintin 2|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5h3_xl4gSAo2zIvTa56YnVrt2wWyA?docId=N0287381319628509028A|work=The Press Association|publisher=Google|accessdate=October 26, 2011|date=Spielberg &amp; Jackson up for Tintin 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
