'''FreeDOS''' (formerly '''Free-DOS''' and '''PD-DOS''') is an [[operating system]] for [[IBM PC compatible]] computers.  FreeDOS is made up of many different, separate programs that act as &quot;packages&quot; to the overall FreeDOS Project.&lt;ref name=&quot;SF&quot;/&gt;  As a member of the [[DOS]] family, it provides mainly disk access through its [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], and partial [[memory management]], but no default [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] (although [[OpenGEM]] is listed on the official FreeDOS website).  {{As of|2011}} FreeDOS itself was at version 1.0, released on September 3, 2006;&lt;ref name=&quot;freedos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedos.org/|title=Official homepage of FreeDOS|date=|accessdate= 2008-01-02|author= |publisher= FreeDOS}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of the packages making up FreeDos are updated or added to frequently.

FreeDOS supports vintage hardware IBM PC as well as modern ones, in addition to [[embedded computer]]s.  Unlike [[MS-DOS]], it is composed of [[free and open source software]], licensed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).  It does not require license fees or royalties and creation of custom distributions is permitted.&lt;ref name=&quot;SF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/freedos/|title=The FreeDOS Project|date=2006-05-21|accessdate=2008-01-02|author=|publisher=SourceForge}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in its &quot;util&quot; section, it includes non-GPL software such as [[4DOS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;4DOS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedos.org/software/?cat=util|title=FreeDOS Software: util section|date=|accessdate=09-05-26|author=|publisher=The FreeDOS Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FreeDOS has a sparsely-populated [[IRC channel]], #freedos, on irc.i7c.org.

== History ==
The FreeDOS [[project]] began June 29, 1994, after [[Microsoft]] announced it would no longer sell or support [[MS-DOS]].  [[Jim Hall (programmer)|Jim Hall]] then posted a manifesto proposing the development of an [[open-source]] replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup  | title =  PD-DOS project *announcement* | author = [[Jim Hall (programmer)|Jim Hall]] | date = 1994-06-29 | newsgroup = comp.os.msdos.apps | url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.msdos.apps/browse_thread/thread/a10993e044dc4b35/e1bb36f1f0d1513b?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=26#e1bb36f1f0d1513b | accessdate = 2008-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a few weeks, other programmers including [[Pat Villani]] (1954â2011) and [[Tim Norman]] joined the project. A kernel, the  [[COMMAND.COM]] [[command line interpreter]] and core utilities were created by pooling code they had written or found available.&lt;ref name = &quot;linuxdevices&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/The-past-present-and-future-of-the-FreeDOS-Project/|title=The past, present, and future of the FreeDOS Project|date=2002-03-25|accessdate=2008-06-14|author=Hall, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.freedos.org/freedos/about/| date=September 23, 2006| title=History of FreeDOS|first=Jim| last=Hall| publisher=freedos.org| accessdate=2007-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been several official pre-release distributions of FreeDOS before the final FreeDOS 1.0 distribution.&lt;ref name= &quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title = Removing old distributions from ibiblio |author = [[Jim Hall (programmer)|Jim Hall]] |date = 2007-10-02 |newsgroup = Freedos-devel  | id =   | url = http://www.mail-archive.com/freedos-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg05988.html  | accessdate = 2009-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  '''GNU/DOS''', a distribution of FreeDOS, was discontinued after version 1.0 was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnudos/|title=GNU/DOS|date=2007-03-29|accessdate=2009-01-02|author=|publisher=SourceForge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/GNU-DOS-Project-Discontinued-41470.shtml|title=GNU/DOS Project Discontinued|date=2006-12-02|accessdate=2009-01-02|author=Marinof, Mihai|publisher=Softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
FreeDOS 1.0 is available for download as [[CD-ROM]] images: a base disc that only contains the kernel and basic applications, and a full disc that contains many more applications (games, networking, development, etc.), not available {{As of|2011|11|lc=on}} but with a newer version announced &quot;soon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedos.org/freedos/files/|title=FreeDOS: Files|date=|accessdate=2011-11-04|author=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of these two discs with source code, which can boot as [[LiveCD]]s, are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedos.org/freedos/files/|title=FreeDOS: Files|date=|accessdate=2009-05-26|author=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial uses ===
FreeDOS is used by several companies:
* [[Dell]] includes FreeDOS with their [[Dell n Series|n-series]] [[Desktop computer|desktop]]s. The firm has been criticized for making these machines no cheaper, and harder to buy than identical systems with Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/06/dell_open_pc/|title=How Dell repels attempts to buy its 'open source' PC|accessdate=2008-01-02|author=Vance, Ashlee|publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Dell often only offers FreeDOS systems with features such as dual-core processors, which FreeDOS cannot use (although theoretically a [[DOS extender]] could).
* [[HP]] provides FreeDOS as an option in its ''dc5750'' desktops, ''Mini 5101'' [[netbook]]s and ''Probook'' [[laptop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/12546_na/12546_na.HTML |title=DC5750 Product Specifications |accessdate=2009-08-01 |date=2008-10-29 |publisher=[[HP]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/First-Look-at-HPs-LowCost-ProBook-Laptop-Lineup-880043/|title=First Look at HP's Low-Cost ProBook Laptop Lineup |accessdate=2009-03-26|publisher=[[EWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technologizer.com/2009/06/23/hps-mini-5101-netbook-deluxe-with-all-the-trimmings/ |title=HPâs Mini 5101: Netbook Deluxe, With All the Trimmings |accessdate=2009-08-01 |last=McCracken |first=Harry |date=2009-06-23 |publisher=Technologizer }}&lt;/ref&gt;  FreeDOS is also used to create [[bootable]] media for [[Patch (computing)#Application|updating]] the [[BIOS]] [[firmware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodTypeId=321957&amp;prodSeriesId=3442832&amp;swItem=ob-88522-1&amp;mode=4&amp;idx=3 |title=FreeDOS Bootable Media |accessdate=2011-01-13 |date=2010-10-25 |publisher=[[HP]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MS-DOS and Win32 console===
FreeDOS is mostly compatible with MS-DOS. It supports [[COM file|.COM executables]], standard [[DOS executable]]s and [[Borland]]'s 16-bit [[DOS Protected Mode Interface|DPMI]] executables. It is also possible to run [[32-bit]] DPMI executables using [[DOS extender]]s.  The operating system has several improvements relative to MS-DOS, mostly involving support of newer standards and technologies that did not exist when Microsoft ended support for MS-DOS, such as [[internationalization]], [[Advanced Power Management]] [[Terminate and Stay Resident|TSR]]s, and integrated [[ASPI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Techworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techworld.com/networking/news/index.cfm?newsid=6783|title=DOS lives! Open source reinvents past|date=2006-09-04|accessdate=2009-05-26|author=Matthew Broersma|publisher=Techworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, with use of [[HX DOS Extender]], many [[Win32 console]] applications function properly in FreeDOS, as do some [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] programs, like [[QEMU]] and [[Bochs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japheth.de/HX.html|title=HX DOS Extender|date=|accessdate=2009-01-02|author=japheth|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows 1.0 to 3.xx===
FreeDOS is able to run [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Microsoft Windows 1.0|1.0]] and [[Microsoft Windows 2.0|2.0]] releases. Windows [[Windows 3.0|3.x]] releases, which had support for [[Intel 80386|i386]] processors, can be run in ''[[386 Enhanced Mode]]'' since FreeDOS kernel build 2037.

===Windows 9x and Windows Millennium Edition ===
[[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98|98]] and [[Windows Me|Me]] use a stripped down version of MS-DOS as a [[bootloader]]. FreeDOS cannot be used as a replacement bootloader; however, it can be installed and used beside these systems using a [[boot manager]] program, such as the &quot;METAKERN&quot; included with FreeDOS. Problems running Windows result from Microsoft's [[AARD code|efforts to prevent]] their products running on non-Microsoft DOS implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/600488.stm|title=Caldera vs Microsoft - the settlement|date=2000-01-13|accessdate=2009-01-02|author=Lea, Graham|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows NT/2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/7/2008 R2 and ReactOS ===
[[Windows NT]]-based operating systems, including [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], [[Windows 2003|2003]], [[Windows Vista|Vista]], [[Windows 2008|2008]], [[Windows 7|7]] and [[Windows 2008 R2|2008 R2]] do not make use of [[MS-DOS]] as a core component of the system.  These systems can make use of the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file systems, which are used by MS-DOS and earlier versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]; however, they typically use the [[NTFS]] ([[Windows NT|NT]] File System) by default.  FreeDOS can coexist on these systems on a separate partition on NTFS systems, or on the same partition on FAT systems.  The FreeDOS [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] can be booted by adding it to the [[NTLDR|Windows NT Boot Loader]] configuration file, '''boot.ini''', or '''freeldr.ini''' for [[ReactOS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot;/&gt;

===File systems===
[[Image:Fdedit.png|thumb|250px|A screenshot of FreeDOS's default text editor. It is a clone of the [[MS-DOS Editor]] with added features.]]
[[FAT32]] is fully supported and can be booted from. Depending on the [[BIOS]] used, up to four [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] hard disks up to 128 GB, or 2 TB, in size are supported. There has been little testing with large disks, and some BIOSes support LBA but produce errors on disks larger than 32 GB; a driver such as [[OnTrack]] or [[EZ-Drive]] resolves this problem. FreeDOS can also be used with a driver called ''DOSLFN'', which supports long file names (see [[File Allocation Table|VFAT]]), but most old programs do not support long file names even if the driver is loaded.  There is no planned support for [[NTFS]] or [[ext2]], but there are several external third-party drivers available for that purpose. To access ext2fs, [[LTOOLS]] (counterpart to [[Mtools|MTOOLS]]) can be used to copy data to and from ext2fs drives. NTFS support is provided by software such as [[NTFSDOS]] and NTFS4DOS.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Universal Serial Bus===
{{As of|2011}} there was no [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] driver support inside the FreeDOS project, but many modern motherboards contain BIOS settings for &quot;Legacy USB&quot; support which allow USB devices to be used in operating systems that lack support for them (such as FreeDOS). This applies to keyboards and mice; some BIOSes support storage devices. Some external DOS USB drivers (such as DUSE, USBASPI and USBMASS) for storage devices work with some effort. There is also DOSUSB which offers an API and supports storage devices, printers and serial adapters. An alternative to running DOS programs with USB devices is to use virtualisation software, such as [[DOSBox]], which recognizes USB devices from the host operating system to act as if they were &quot;legacy port&quot; devices (e.g. [[joystick]]s with [[game port]]s, printers with [[parallel port]]s, and [[USB flash drive]]s would act as if they were a hard drive for DOS), but this requires an OS with a GUI.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Technical details==
=== Booting ===
FreeDOS can be booted from a [[hard drive]], [[live CD]], [[USB flash drive]] or [[floppy disk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linfo.org/freedos_floppy.html|title=How to Create a Bootable FreeDOS Floppy Disk|date=2005-07-19|accessdate=2008-08-04|author=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ben.franske.com/blogs/2007/08/21/booting_dos_from_a_usb_flash_drive|title=Booting DOS from a USB flash drive|date= 2007-08-21|accessdate= 2008-08-04|author=Franske, Ben |publisher=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genetikayos.livejournal.com/43998.html|title=FreeDOS on a USB Flash Drive|date=2005-12-19|accessdate=2008-08-04|author=genetikayos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedos.org/freedos/files/|title=FreeDOS Files|date=|accessdate=2008-08-04|author=|publisher=FreeDOS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be run using [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] software like [[Microsoft Virtual PC|Virtual PC]] and [[VirtualBox]] or [[emulator|emulation]] software like [[Bochs]] and [[QEMU]].&lt;ref name = &quot;linuxdevices&quot;/&gt; To use the Windows Boot Menu the following line can be added to &lt;code&gt;[[BOOT.INI|C:\BOOT.INI]]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;ref name=&quot;Herbert&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/freedos_no_removable.html|title=Install FreeDOS without any CD, floppy, USB-key, nor any other removable media|date=2004-10-01|accessdate=2009-05-26|author=Marc Herbert|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 C:\FDOSBOOT.BIN=&quot;FreeDOS&quot;
To boot using [[GRUB]] something similar to the following can be added to menu.lst:
 title FreeDOS           # Anything you want
 root hd(x,y)            # x = device and y = partition on which FreeDOS resides
 chainloader /kernel.sys # Boots FreeDOS's bootloader

=== Memory management ===
The FreeCOM shell, FreeDOS's version of [[COMMAND.COM]], can move portions of itself into [[extended memory]] freeing up large portions of [[conventional memory]], up to 620 kB. This is useful for DOS programs which only use conventional memory.  The [[HIMEM]] and [[EMM386]] memory management programs included with FreeDOS provide [[extended memory]] (XMS) and [[expanded memory]] (EMS) for old real mode software, EMM386 also supports [[Virtual Control Program Interface|VCPI]], which allows [[DOS Protected Mode Interface|DPMI]] kernels and DOS extenders to coexist with it. FreeDOS also contains an [[UDMA]] driver for faster disk access, which is also compatible with other DOS versions. The LBAcache disk cache stores recently accessed disk data in XMS for faster access and less direct disk access.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
