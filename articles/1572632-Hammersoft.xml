'''MediaCorp Channel 8''' ([[Simplified Chinese|Chinese]]: å«é¢é, Before 1 January 2005: ç¬¬å«æ³¢é) is a 24-hour free-to-air [[Mandarin Chinese]] general entertainment [[television channel]] in [[Singapore]]. It is one of the two Mandarin Chinese over-the-air television channel in [[Singapore]] the other being [[MediaCorp Channel U|Channel U]], formerly of [[SPH MediaWorks]].

==History==
The station began broadcasting on 23 November 1963 as Saluran 8 Television Singapura is a first [[free-to-air]] terrestrial television station in [[Singapore]] and programming at that time consisted of a mixture of [[Tamil Language|Tamil]] and [[Mandarin language|Mandarin Chinese]] programming, with a majority of the programmes bought from foreign television stations. The stations with [[Tamil language]] programmes were moved to [[MediaCorp TV12|Prime 12]] and Channel 8 became a solely [[Mandarin language|Mandarin Chinese]] channel.

Channel 5 began transmitting in [[Color television|colour]] on 7 July 1974.

Channel 5 began transmitting in [[Color television|full colour]] on 1 November 1977.

The station was airing [[stereo]] audio television on 1 August 1990.

The station was privatized on 1 October 1994, SBC became [[Television Corporation of Singapore]] (TCS) (Chinese: æ°å å¡é»è¦æ©æ§).

[[Malay language|Malay]] programmes were transferred to [[MediaCorp TV12|Prime 12]], later renamed [[MediaCorp Vasantham|Vasantham]] on same date (as of 27 September 1995).

The station was airing 24-hours on daily transmission opened business broadcasting on same date (as of 27 September 1995).

The station was privatized on 12 February 2001, TCS became [[MediaCorp|MediaCorp TV]] (Chinese: æ°å³åªé»è¦).

In 1 November 2011, Channel 8 now broadcasts in 16:9 HDTV, however, some programmes including news programmes and a few encores were broadcast in 4:3 SDTV.

===Chinese Language Broadcasting===
In the infancy of the station, Chinese programmes were acquired from stations in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], which resulted in these programmes being broadcast in a variety of regional Chinese dialects (such as [[Guangzhou dialect|Cantonese]] and [[Min Nan]] with no dubbing in Mandarin. This anomaly ended in 1979 when the government began to forbid Singapore's electronic media from broadcasting programmes in any dialects other than Mandarin without prior consent.

This put a pressure on the station's budget, as Chinese programmes acquired overseas now have to be dubbed into Mandarin. As a result, SBC decided to begin producing Chinese drama series domestically, and established a Chinese Drama Department (è¯ææ²åé¨) towards that end. The new department had to hire many production staffs overseas, as the station only had experience in producing short television programmes. Due to the closure of [[Commercial Television]] and the sale of [[Rediffusion Television]] (now [[Asia Television]]) in [[Hong Kong]] at the time, many production staff from those two television stations were hired, thus creating a basis for domestic Chinese drama series production.

Although there were earlier productions, the station considers [[Seletar Robbery]] to be its first-ever Chinese drama production, and considers the day of its premiere on 24 July 1982 to be the birth of Singaporean Chinese Drama Production.

===Privatisation===
The station, along with its sister stations [[MediaCorp Channel 5|Fifth Frequency]] and [[MediaCorp TV12|Twelfth Frequency]], were privatized on 1 October 1994, and became a part of the new [[Television Corporation of Singapore]] (TCS) (Chinese: æ°å å¡é»è¦æ©æ§). Further restructuring were made and by 12 February 2001, TCS became [[MediaCorp|MediaCorp TV]] (Chinese: æ°å³åªé»è¦).

===Competition from MediaWorks===
In an effort to inject competition into the Singaporean television broadcasting industry, the government allowed [[Singapore Press Holdings]] (SPH) to operate television stations, which resulted in the establishment of [[SPH MediaWorks]]. It offered two television channels: [[SPH MediaWorks Channel U]] (Chinese: ä¼é »é) and [[SPH MediaWorks Channel i|TV Works]] (Chinese: é»è¦é), which was later renamed Channel i (Chinese: ç±é »é).

Channel 8, then still known as the Eight Frequency, and Channel U were both locked in a fierce ratings battle, with each station releasing statistics indicating that they are prevailing over the other station. The ratings battle began to cool in 31 December 2004 when Minister Mentor [[Lee Kuan Yew]] commented that Singapore's size cannot sustain more than one television station for each language. This spurred the two sides into a merger negotiation, which was completed by 31 December 2004. On 1 January 2005, Channel U became a part of MediaCorp TV. SPH MediaWorks Channel i was disbanded in the merger process.
