'''[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) characters''' have been depicted in some '''[[video games]]''' since the 1980s. In the [[history of video games]], LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of [[heterosexism]] in that heterosexuality is normalized while homosexuality is subject to additional [[censorship]] or ridicule. [[Sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] have served a significant role in some [[Console game|console]] and [[personal computer game]]s, with the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities.

==Company policies regarding LGBT content==
===Nintendo===
In order to legally release a game for a [[Nintendo]] system a [[video game developer|developer]] had first to obtain permission from Nintendo. Nintendo reserved the right to preview the games and demand changes before allowing release. They wanted to ensure that no game released for a Nintendo system had objectionable or offensive themes, as well as exercise quality control. This gave rise to a highly developed system of [[censorship]]. A game sold on a Nintendo system could not display or make reference to illicit [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]s, [[tobacco]] and [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], violence against women, blood and graphic violence, [[profanity]], [[nudity]], [[Religious symbolism|religious symbol]]s, political advocacy, or &quot;sexually suggestive or explicit content.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Over&quot;&gt;''[[Game Over (book)|''Game Over'']], David Sheff, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, a creature in Nintendo's own ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' the [[Boss (video gaming)|miniboss]] named [[Birdo]] was described in the original [[Video game packaging|instruction manual]] as thinking he was a girl and wanting to be called &quot;Birdetta&quot;. This was later censored by Nintendo of America in future appearances of the character. In 1992, [[Enix]] was ordered to remove a gay bar in ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'', among other content changes, before the game could be sold on a Nintendo system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] version of ''[[Ultima VII]]'' also had to be substantially altered from its original computer edition to remove potentially objectionable content, like ritual murders, or the option to have a male or female &quot;bedmate&quot; if the player paid their fee at the buccaneer-run island.

By 1999, Nintendo had largely given up on its own censorship policies. A year later, [[Rare (company)|Rare]] released ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] with a gay [[frog]] [[bartender]] named &quot;Jolly Roger.&quot; The frog wanted Banjo and Kazooie to rescue his co-worker, Merry Maggie, a cross-dressing amphibian who appeared to be Jolly Roger's lover. Jolly Roger would return as a [[Player character|playable character]] in the [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Banjo-Pilot]]'' (2005). Rare would also release ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'' (2001) for the Nintendo 64, featuring an alcoholic [[squirrel]] named Conker and his adventures in a world where all of the characters are foul-mouthed creatures who made various dirty jokes in reference to [[hangover]]s, [[homosexuality]] and [[oral sex]]. Enix re-released ''Dragon Warrior III'' for the [[Game Boy Color]] and was allowed to keep all the original content provided the game was given a ''Teen'' rating by the ESRB.

===Sega===
Like Nintendo, Sega policed the content of games for Sega systems. Unlike Nintendo, Sega's initial system of censorship was more liberal. The Sega content code allowed games to have blood, more graphic violence, female enemies, and more sexually suggestive themes.

Although Sega allowed [[LGBT]] themes and characters in games sold for its home console systems, Sega often chose to tone down or erase LGBT characters when [[porting]] Asian games to American markets. In ''[[Phantasy Star II]]'', a musician's homosexuality was edited so that the only acknowledgment of his sexual orientation was the fact that he charged all male characters less money for his music lessons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Phantasy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Ripplinger|year=2002|title=The Two Phantasy Stars  |url=http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080204060641/http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archivedate=2008-02-04|publisher=Camineet|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, when ''[[Final Fight]]'' was released for the [[Sega CD]] and [[Vendetta (video game)|Vendetta]] was released for the [[Sega Genesis]], minor transgender and homosexual enemies were [[censorship|censored]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-mockery.com/minimocks/sexual-games/21.php |title=Sexual Moments in Video Game History |publisher=I-mockery.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Sega's ''[[Streets of Rage 3]]'' removed a gay villain wearing [[Village People]] attire and transformed a transsexual villain into a man with long hair. It is unclear whether LGBT censorship was part of an overall censorship policy or the voluntary decision of a developer.

In 1993, Sega developed the [[Videogame Rating Council]] to give content based ratings to all games sold on a Sega system, thus reducing the need for Sega to maintain a content code for its developers. When ''[[Rise of the Dragon]]'' was developed for the [[Sega CD]], by [[Dynamix]], a transgender bar patron was retained from the original computer edition as was a gay joke relating to the playable character mistaking his girlfriend for a man with long hair. For this and other reasons the game was given the Council's &quot;MA-17&quot; rating.

===Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)===
In 1994, several top gaming publishers formed the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (ESA) as the [[trade association]] of the [[video game industry]]. Shortly after its creation, the ESA established the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB) to independently assign individual games content ratings and descriptors according to a variety of factors. In an example of [[heterosexism]], where LGBT identity is not treated neutrally vis-Ã -vis heterosexuality, gay and transgender characters are currently placed within the content descriptors of mature humor, sexual content, or sexual themes{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, all of which qualify games for the restricted M (Mature) or AO (Adults Only) content ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/ratings_guide.jsp |title=ESRB Game Ratings &amp; Descriptor Guide |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Entertainment Software Rating Board |accessdate=June 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the establishment of the ESRB, console developers relaxed their in-house regulations in favor of ESRB ratings. In 1994, Sega dissolved its Videogame Rating Council after only one year in existence.

==Depictions of LGBT characters==
{{Also|List of LGBT characters in video games}}

A number of recurring [[Trope (literature)|tropes]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]]s and [[archetype]]s have developed in the gaming industry with reference to LGBT sexuality. These were often similar to how other forms of popular culture such as Hollywood movie and [[television program|TV shows]] dealt with LGBT sexuality.

===Comical gender confusion===
A common way to deal with LGBT characters is to reveal their sexual orientation through gender inversion. A male character's homosexuality was often indicated by making him a [[sissy]] character with [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] or flamboyant mannerisms, dress, and speech. The underlying assumption is that homosexuals tend also to be transsexual and therefore possess mannerisms [[stereotype|stereotypical]] of the opposite sex. This technique previously had been widely used in Hollywood movies (to circumvent the Production Code's ban on &quot;sexual perversion&quot;) and before that in [[Vaudeville]]. Although mainly used in video games for its comedic value, gender confusion has also been used as a tool to offer social commentary about [[sexism]] or [[homophobia]]. The censorship codes of Nintendo and Sega limited the usage of gender inversion to exclusion of [[cross-dressing]] until 1994.

===Transgender characters in video games===
[[Image:FinalFight2.gif|thumb|right|[[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]] from '''[[Final Fight]]''' (arcade version).]]

[[Image:FinalFight2Sega.gif|thumb|right|Roxy from '''Final Fight''' ([[Sega CD]] version).]]

The '''Super Mario Bros. 2''' character Birdo was described as thinking he was a girl and wanting to be called Birdetta in early editions of the instruction manual. The character was changed to simply female until Smash Bros. Brawl reintroduced the concept of Birdo's gender being &quot;indeterminate&quot;.  Likewise, the [[Infocom]] game titled '''[[Circuit's Edge]]''' features several transsexual characters.

[[Capcom]] created '''[[Final Fight]]''' for the arcade in 1989. The beat 'em up involved the player picking among three fighters on a quest to save the mayor's daughter who was [[kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a criminal gang known as Mad Gear. In 1990, Capcom presented Nintendo with a version of the game for the 16-bit [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. According to David Sheffs' book ''Game Over'', Nintendo stated that Capcom could not have a female enemy as that violated Nintendo's ban on violence against women. Capcom countered that there were no female enemies in the game, revealing that the female characters Roxy and [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Final Fight|developer=Capcom|platform=Super Famicom|language=Japanese|level=[http://www.videogameden.com/sfc/extra/fif.pdf Instruction manual, page 25]}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also in fact [[Transsexualism|transsexual]]s. The characters were nevertheless removed from the international versions of the [[Final Fight#Super NES|SNES port]] (the Japanese Super Famicom version retained the characters).&lt;ref name=gameover_page225&gt;{{cite book|title=Game Over|last=Sheff|first=David|authorlink=David Sheff|page=225|quote=With Capcom USA, Phillips's team edited some of the grislier games that came in from its Japanese parent company, although Capcom's own censors weeded out the most offensive touches... When a Capcom USA representative suggested that it was tasteless to have the game's hero beat up a woman, a Japanese designer responded that there were no women in the game. 'What about the blonde named Roxy?' the American asked. The designer responded, 'Oh, you mean the transvestite!' Roxy was given a haircut and new clothes.|isbn=0679404694}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1993, Sega obtained the rights to release the game for their [[Sega CD]]. In a sign of Sega's more liberal polices, Poison and Roxy could remain in the international versions, but with less-provocative clothing;&lt;ref name=&quot;ignFFwalkthrough&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.faqs.ign.com/articles/108/1084283p1.html|title=Final Fight: Double Impact Walkthrough/Achievement Guide V0.6|author=Paul Acevedo|publisher=[[ign.com]]}} &quot;Poison and Roxy are present in the US version, but their clothes have been redrawn to cover their chests and thighs. The image of Jessica shown in the intro was censored as well&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; also there could be no indication of their supposed transgendered status (Sega of America later removed a homosexual boss from the international versions of '''[[Streets of Rage 3]]''').

'''[[Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle]]''' featured a futuristic beauty contest that featured oddly-dressed humans. A person the player can interact with is some Harold who is dressed like a woman and expresses homosexual attraction. The sprite of the character is based on the one of [[George Washington]], who also appears in the game.

===Gay characters in fighting games===
Many [[fighting game]]s have characters who are either confirmed or thought to be gay. Having gay male characters in these fighting games can challenge the traditional perception of homosexuals as weak. Nevertheless, hints about a particular character's sexual orientation in a fighting game often take the form of effeminate features, in an otherwise tough and stereotypically masculine character.

In 1994, Sega of America would make various changes to the [[fighting game|beat 'em up]] '''Streets of Rage 3''' from its original Japanese counterpart called '''Bare Knuckle 3'''. Among the changes was the removal of the boss named Ash (with a straight character named Shiva replacing him) whose homosexuality was explicitly established by the &quot;[[Village People]]&quot; attire that he wore. Ash was taken out of the western edition of the game, but remained a playable character with the aid of the [[Game Genie]]. Thus, Sega unintentionally became the first major video game company in the west to give the player the option of choosing a gay character.

The '''[[Street Fighter]]''' character [[Zangief]] has long been thought of as being homosexual,{{bywhom|date=November 2011}} although this was disputed in ''[[Capcom Fighting Evolution]]'', where it was stated that he had a girlfriend. The ''Street Fighter'' character [[Street Fighter (video game)|Eagle]], who appears in the original ''[[Street Fighter (video game)|Street Fighter]]'' as well as in '''[[Capcom vs. SNK 2]]''', has however been confirmed to be gay, as a tribute to [[Queen (band)|Queen]] singer [[Freddie Mercury]], although several of Eagle's quotes obviously displaying his orientation were censored in the North American version of the game. In the more recent Super Street Fighter IV, the prologue of the fighter Abel hints that his character may be homosexual due to &quot;settling down&quot; with a fellow French mercenary. Also from Super Street Fighter IV, Juri Han is hinted of being possibly a lesbian, or even a bisexual female. It is especially evidenced in Chun-Li and Cammy's rival cutscenes where Juri has the audacity to ask them out for less than pure reasons before proceeding to kill them.

In the '''[[Guilty Gear]]''' series the character [[List of characters in the Guilty Gear series#Venom|Venom]] is most clearly in love with his deceased leader, [[List of characters in the Guilty Gear series#Zato-1|Zato-1]], although his feelings do not seem to have been returned.

Being [[succubus|succubi]], [[Lilith Aensland]] and [[Morrigan Aensland]] in Capcom's '''[[Darkstalkers]]''' series have been long portrayed as being rather openly bisexual.

An obscure game known as '''[[Power Instinct|Groove on Fight]]''' is currently the only known fighting game featuring an openly gay couple, the somewhat stereotypical characters [[Power Instinct|Rudolph Gartheimer]] and [[Power Instinct|Damian Shade]].

The character [[World Heroes#Characters|Rasputin]] in the '''[[World Heroes]]''' series is implied to be homosexual.  One of his win poses has him trying to hold his robes down while wind blows them up, similar to the famous [[Marilyn Monroe]] pose.  He has a special move in [[World Heroes Perfect]] called &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; in which he pulls characters into bushes and presumably has his way with them while hearts float skyward.  This move only works on male characters.

==Marketing to LGBT consumers==
{{See also|Pink money}}
It has been widely assumed that young, white, heterosexual males are the force driving the industry forward. That belief was strongly challenged by the record-breaking success of [[The Sims]]. Maxis had resisted [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]]'s goal of creating the title on the grounds that &quot;girls don't play video games&quot;, and the title was seen as being one that did not appeal well to young heterosexual males.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Yorker&quot;&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/11/06/061106fa_fact?currentPage=all &quot;Will Wright, Game Master&quot;], by John Seabrook&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s the industry began to make some efforts to market games to women by creating software titles with strong and independent female characters as seen in ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil (video game)|Resident Evil]]''. Some video game companies are now moving to further expand their marketing base to include the perceived market of affluent homosexual young men by including LGBT characters and supporting [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]]. [[Bioware]] has included female same-sex scenes in [[Mass Effect]] and allowed sexual interaction between any gender group in [[Dragon Age: Origins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asylum.com/2009/12/07/gay-video-game-characters-coming-out-of-the-closet/|title=Gay Video Game Characters Coming Out of the Closet|author=Xav de Matos|publisher=http://www.asylum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even some games that are considered appealing mainly to the non-traditional demographic continue to censor homosexuality. For instance, despite the tremendous success of [[The Sims]], even the most recent version of the franchise suppresses homosexual identity. Autonomous romantic interactions exist only for heterosexual characters by default.&lt;ref name=&quot;ModtheSims&quot;&gt;[http://modthesims.info/download.php?t=388170 &quot;Autonomous Romantic Socials - Same Sex&quot;], by werismyki&lt;/ref&gt; In [[The Sims 3]], players must manually initiate multiple same-sex romantic interactions before a character will be &quot;converted&quot; to homosexuality and begin to engage in such interactions autonomously. The town will be marked gay-friendly, unlocking the autonomy for other characters. If a player does not force at least one character several times to engage in same-sex advances, the player's town will have no visible homosexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sims3&quot;&gt;[http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/30/191458.page &quot;Why is My Town Gay?&quot;], by Srikandi&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the suppression of gay identity often come to the conclusion that, as homosexuality is normalized in broader culture, it will be in video games as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeoSeeker&quot;&gt;[http://www.neoseeker.com/news/11314-sunday-musing-homosexuality-in-video-games/ &quot;Homosexuality in Video Games&quot;], by Lydia Sung&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotaku&quot;&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5232808/how-not-to-address-homosexuality-in-gaming &quot;How Not To Address Homosexuality In Gaming&quot;], by Mike Fahey&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 survey exploring [[Gaymer|gay gamers]] was the first academic study of any gamer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|title=Gay gamer survey results with large hetero inclusion|author=Alexander Sliwinski|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; With about 10.000 respondents the survey exhibited a reverse [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] of gamer sexuality, with most people identifying as either completely heterosexual or homosexual.

==Working inside the industry==
Little is known about what it is like to work within the industry as a gay person. People within the industry do not want to talk about it, and gay rights organizations have been slow to pay much attention to this billion dollar industry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The result is that much of the information that does come out is in dispute. [[Danielle Bunten Berry|Dani Bunten]], a MTF transsexual, designed some of the earliest multiplayer games. In 1996, a Maxis employee named [[Jacque Servin]] was fired when he put gay characters into the ''[[SimCopter]]'' game. Depending on the news source, Servin claims to have done it because he was upset at being grossly overworked at Maxis or as some type of political statement.

==Asian gaming cultures and depictions of LGBT sexuality==
Most Western games are made for a Western audience. However, Japan, Korea and Taiwan all have large gaming industries which produce for local audiences. Many video games are developed in Japan, and some effort has been made at making what could be called 'gay games.' In [[LGBT in Japan|Japanese popular culture]], LGBT men were often considered [[bishÅnen]], which translates as &quot;beautiful boys.&quot; This was also tied to the success in Japan of comic books and animation with open and subtle LGBT characters. A select genre of adult [[pornography|pornographic]] Japanese games exist called [[Eroge|H-games]]. This genre includes [[BL game|gay male]] and [[Yuri (genre)|gay female]] subgenres. This material generally does not make it over to the west in English, and western reviews of the gay male video games tend to see the homosexuality as a gimmick in an otherwise mediocre game. However, homosexuality, while relatively innocuous among [[celebrity|celebrities]] in Japan, can still be considered an oddity due to Japan's regimented and conservative social structure. Despite a lack of strong social stigma, homosexuality in men is commonly misconstrued with [[transgenderism (social movement)|transgenderism]] and [[transvestism]] in [[Japan]] and open homosexuality is rare, due to [[conformity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Intersections&quot;&gt;[http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue3/mclelland2.html &quot;Male Homosexuality and Popular Culture in Modern Japan&quot;], by Dr. Mark McLelland&lt;/ref&gt;
