A '''spermatozoon''' (alternate spellings '''spermatozoan''', '''spermatozoÃ¶n'''; plural '''spermatozoa''') is a motile [[sperm]] [[Cell (biology)|cell]], or moving form of the [[ploidy|haploid]] [[cell (biology)|cell]] that is the male [[gamete]]. (A non-motile sperm cell is called a [[spermatium]].) A spermatozoon [[Fertilization|joins]] an [[ovum]] to form a [[zygote]]. (A zygote is a single cell, with a complete set of [[chromosome]]s, that normally develops into an [[embryo]].) The term ''spermatozoon'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] word ÏÏÎ­ÏÎ¼Î± (seed) and {{unicode|Î¶á¿·Î¿Î½}} (living being).
 
Sperm cells contribute approximately half of the nuclear [[gene|genetic information]] to the [[diploid]] offspring. In mammals, the [[sex]] of the offspring is determined by the sperm cell: a spermatozoon bearing a [[Y chromosome]] will lead to a [[male]] (XY) offspring, while  one bearing a [[X chromosome]] will lead to a [[female]] (XX) offspring -- the [[ovum]] always providing a X chromosome. Sperm cells were first observed by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in 1677.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/genetics_reproduction/timeline.html|title=Timeline: Assisted reproduction and birth control|accessdate=2006-04-06 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mammalian spermatozoan structure, function, and size ==

[[Image:Spermatozoa-human-3140x.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Electron [[micrograph]] of human spermatozoa magnified 3140 times.]]
=== Humans ===
The human sperm cell is the reproductive cell in males and will only survive in warm environments, once leaving the body the sperm's survival is reduced and may cause the cell to die, decreasing the [[sperm quality]]. Sperm cells come in two types, &quot;female&quot; and &quot;male&quot;. Sperm cells that give rise to female (XX) offspring after fertilization differ in that they carry an X-chromosome, while sperm cells that give rise to male (XY) offspring carry a Y-chromosome. 

In male humans, sperm cells consists of a head 5&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|Âµm]] by 3&amp;nbsp;Âµm and a tail 41&amp;nbsp;Âµm long. The tail [[Flagellum|flagellate]]s, which propels the sperm cell (at about 1â3&amp;nbsp;mm/minute in humans) by whipping in an elliptical cone.&lt;ref&gt;Sumio Ishijima, Shigeru Oshio, Hideo Mohri, &quot;''Flagellar movement of human spermatozoa''&quot;, Gamete research,  1986, vol. 13, no3, pp. 185â197 (27 ref.) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/109926914/ABSTRACT?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semen]] has an alkaline nature, and they do not reach full motility (hypermotility) until they reach the [[vagina]] where the alkaline pH is neutralized by acidic vaginal fluids.  This gradual process takes 20â30 minutes. In this time, [[fibrinogen]] from the [[seminal vesicles]] forms a clot, securing and protecting the sperm. Just as they become hypermotile, [[fibrinolysin]] from the [[prostate]] dissolves the clot, allowing the sperm to progress optimally. 

The spermatozoon is characterized by a minimum of [[cytoplasm]] and the most densely packed DNA known in [[eukaryotes]]. Compared to [[mitosis|mitotic]] chromosomes in [[somatic cell]]s, sperm DNA is at least sixfold more highly condensed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ward WS, Coffey DS |title=DNA packaging and organization in mammalian spermatozoa: comparison with somatic cells |journal=Biol. Reprod. |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=569â74 |year=1991 |pmid=2043729| doi = 10.1095/biolreprod44.4.569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specimen contributes with [[DNA]]/[[chromatin]], a [[centriole]] and perhaps also an [[oocyte]]-activating factor (OAF).&lt;ref name=barroso&gt;[http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282%2809%2901351-X/abstract Developmental sperm contributions: fertilization and beyond] Gerardo Barroso, M.D., M.Sc.a, Carlos Valdespin, M.D.a, Eva Vega, M.Sc.a, Ruben Kershenovich, M.D.a, Rosaura Avila, B.Sc.a, Conrado AvendaÃ±o, M.D.b, Sergio Oehninger, M.D., Ph.D.b. FertStert, Volume 92, Issue 3, Pages 835-848 (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It may also contribute with paternal [[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA), also contributing to embryonic development.&lt;ref name=barroso/&gt;

=== Avoidance of immune system response ===

[[Glycoprotein]] molecules on the surface of sperm cells are recognized by all human immune systems, and interpreted as a signal that the cell should not be rejected. The male immune system might otherwise attack sperm whilst in the testes, and the female immune system would attack sperm in the [[reproductive tract]]. The specific glycoproteins coating sperm cells are also utilized by some cancerous and bacterial cells, some parasitic worms, and HIV-infected white blood cells, thereby avoiding an immune response from the [[Host (biology)|host organism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7143889.stm|title=Sperm clue to 'disease immunity'|date=2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[blood-testis barrier]], maintained by the tight junctions between the [[Sertoli cell]]s of the seminiferous tubules, prevents communication between the forming spermatozoa and the blood vessels within the [[Interstitial space (biology)|interstitial space]]. This gives the forming spermatozoa an immunological advantage and thus prevents them from eliciting an immune response. The blood-testis barrier is also important in preventing toxic substances from disrupting spermatogenesis.

=== Animals ===
Fertilization relies on spermatozoa for most sexually reproductive animals.

The [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] has the largest known spermatozoon relative to its size.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livescience.com/animalworld/060616_big_sperm.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' produces sperm that can be up to 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;ref&gt;Pitnick, S., Spicer, G. S., &amp; Markow, T. A. (1995). How long is a giant sperm Nature, 375(6527), 109. doi:10.1038/375109a0&lt;/ref&gt; in size. The incredibly long tail is thought to block other sperm from entering the egg. The entire sperm, tail included, gets incorporated into the [[oocyte]] [[cytoplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Scott F., Developmental Biology, Eighth Edition. 2006. Sinauer Associates, pp. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

The wood mouse ''[[Apodemus slvaticus]]'' possesses spermatozoa with falciform morphology. What makes these gametocytes even more unique is the presence of an apical hook on the sperm head. This hook is used to attach to the hooks or to the flagella of other spermatozoa. Aggregation is caused by these attachments and mobile trains result. These trains provide improved motility in the female reproductive tract and are a means by which fertilization is promoted.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Harry et al., Exceptional sperm cooperation in Wood Mouse.Nature 418, 174-177 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sea urchin]]s such as ''[[Arbacia punctulata]]''âare ideal organisms to use in sperm research, they spawn large numbers of sperm into the sea, making them well-suited as [[model organism]]s for experiments.

=== Plants, algae and fungi ===
The [[gametophyte]]s of [[bryophyte]]s, [[fern]]s and some [[gymnosperm]]s produce motile [[sperm]] cells, contrary to [[pollen]] grains employed in most gymnosperms and all [[angiosperm]]s. This renders sexual reproduction in the absence of [[water]] impossible, since water is a necessary medium for sperm and egg to meet. Algae and lower plant sperm cells are often multi-flagellated (see image) and thus morphologically different from animal spermatozoa.

Some algae and fungi produce non-motile sperm cells, called spermatia. In higher plants and some algae and fungi, fertilization involves the migration of the sperm nucleus through a fertilization tube (e.g. [[pollen tube]] in higher plants) to reach the egg cell.

== Spermatozoa production in mammals ==
{{Main|Spermatogenesis}}
Spermatozoa are produced in the [[seminiferous tubule]]s of the [[testes]] in a process called spermatogenesis. Round cells called [[spermatogonia]] divide and differentiate eventually to become spermatozoa. During [[copulation]] the [[cloaca]] or [[vagina]] gets [[insemination|inseminat]]ed, and then the spermatozoa move through [[chemotaxis]] to the ovum inside a [[Fallopian tube]] or the [[uterus]].

== Spermatozoa activation ==
{{main|Acrosome reaction}}
[[Image:Acrosome_reaction_diagram_en.svg|thumb|440px|left|Acrosome reaction on a [[Sea Urchin]] cell]]
Approaching the egg cell is a rather complex, multistep process of [[chemotaxis]] guided by different chemical substances/stimuli on individual levels of phylogeny. One of the most significant, common signaling character of the event is that a prototype of professional chemotaxis receptors, [[formyl peptide receptor]] (60.000 receptor/cell) as well as the activator ability of its ligand formyl Met-Leu-Phe have been demonstrated in the surface membrane even in the case of human sperms.&lt;ref name=Gnessi1986&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Gnessi L, Fabbri A, Silvestroni L, Moretti C, Fraioli F, Pert CB, Isidori A. | year = 1986 | title = Evidence for the presence of specific receptors for N-formyl chemotactic peptides on human spermatozoa.| journal = J Clin Endocrinol Metab| volume = 63| pages = 841â6| pmid =3018025 |doi = 10.1210/jcem-63-4-841| url = | issue = 4 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;     
Mammalian sperm cells become even more active when they approach an egg cell in a process called '''sperm activation'''. Sperm activation has been shown to be caused by [[calcium]] [[ionophores]] ''[[in vitro]]'', [[progesterone]] released by nearby [[cumulus cells]] and binding to [[ZP3]] of the [[zona pellucida]].  The [[cumulus cells]] are embedded in a gel-like substance made primarily of hyaluronic acid, and developed in the ovary with the egg and support it as it grows.

The initial change is called &quot;hyperactivation&quot;, which causes a change in spermatozoa motility. They swim faster and their tail movements become more forceful and erratic. 

A recent discovery links hyperactivation to a sudden influx of calcium ion into the tails.  The whip-like tail (flagellum) of the sperm is studded with [[ion channel]]s formed by proteins called [[CatSper]].  These channels are selective, allowing only calcium ion to pass.  The opening of CatSper channels is responsible for the influx of calcium.  The sudden rise in calcium levels causes the flagellum to form deeper bends, propelling the sperm more forcefully through the viscous environment. Sperm hyperactivity is necessary for breaking through two physical barriers that protect the egg from fertilization. 

The second process in sperm activation is the [[acrosome reaction]]. This involves releasing the contents of the acrosome, which disperse, and the exposure of enzymes attached to the inner acrosomal membrane of the sperm.  This occurs after the sperm first meets the egg.  This lock-and-key type mechanism is species-specific and prevents the sperm and egg of different species from fusing.  There is some evidence that this binding is what triggers the [[acrosome]] to release the enzymes that allow the sperm to fuse with the egg.  

ZP3, one of the proteins that make up the zona pellucida, then binds to a partner molecule on the sperm.  Enzymes on the inner acrosomal membrane digests the zona pellucida.  After the sperm penetrates the zona pellucida, part of the sperm's cell membrane then [[fertilization|fuses]] with the egg cell's membrane, and the contents of the head diffuse into the egg.  

Upon penetration, the oocyte is said to have become [[Ovum activation|activated]]. It undergoes its secondary meiotic division, and the two haploid nuclei (paternal and maternal) fuse to form a [[zygote]]. In order to prevent [[polyspermy]] and minimise the possibility of producing a [[Triploidy|triploid]] zygote, several changes to the egg's zona pellucida renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg.

==Artificial storage==
Spermatozoa can be stored in diluents such has the ''Illini Variable Temperature'' (IVT) diluent, which have been reported to be able to preserve high fertility of spermatozoa for over seven days.&lt;ref name=Watson1993&gt;{{cite doi|10.1071/RD9930691}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVT douent is composed of several salts, sugars and antibacterial agents and gassed with [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name=Watson1993/&gt;

[[Semen cryopreservation]] can be used for far longer storage durations. For human spermatozoa, the longest reported successful storage with this method is 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planer.com/PlanerComWebsite.nsf/7dc62b5d9e44dd40802575460048fc4e/df90c37237a74df88025757d005b0057?OpenDocument Planer NEWS and Press Releases &gt; Child born after 21 year semen storage using Planer controlled rate freezer] 14/10/2004&lt;/ref&gt;
