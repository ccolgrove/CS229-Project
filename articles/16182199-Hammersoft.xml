&quot;'''Val-Hala'''&quot; is a song by [[Elton John]] with lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]]. It is the second track off his first album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''.

==Musical structure==
The song is mid-tempo, and the vocal is mellow. The music is however a bit startling at first, with a very loud [[harpsichord]] playing the main riff although Elton plays his piano as well. In the bridge, a [[Hammond organ]] plays the chords, equivalent for its time of recording. The vocal is somewhat echoed. An [[acoustic guitar]] is also featured, and had it not been for the harpsichord, it could have been a simple folk-rock song. The instrument also ends the song in a coda for itself.

==Lyrical meaning==
The song's title is only spelled as &quot;Val-Hala&quot; on the original 1969 release and the CD reissue. On the American LP release it was spelled correctly, as &quot;Valhalla&quot;. This song is about [[Valhalla]] and Vikings and warriors who fight bravely to get there. It is to date the only John/Taupin-song that carries use of [[Norse mythology]].

==Performances==
It was performed in radio broadcasts as early as 1968. Since the album went forgotten in John's mainstream years the song didn't gain further notice and has never been played live in concert.
