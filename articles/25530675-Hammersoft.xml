From the cross of the Main Building emanate four tongues of fire that spell out U, S, and T.

The Quadricentennial logo was designed by Dopy Doplon, a Thomasian.&lt;ref name=&quot;QLogo&quot;&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=439&amp;Itemid=104 Tongues of Fire]. retrieved December 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

It has two main features: the ''Quadricentennial Fountain'' and the ''Quattromondial''. It is located between the Main Building and the Miguel de Benavides Library. '''The Colayco Shrine''', an iron statue commemorating the World War 2 victim ''Capt. Manuel Colayco'', was nowhere to be found since its removal from the site in 2006.

==== ''Quadricentennial Fountain'' ====
It is a recreational water attraction and interactive fountain was unveiled on 2007. 

It was designed and built by Industron Inc., the same designer of [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] and Liwasang Bonifacio fountains in Manila.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unraveling UST fountain spectacle&quot;&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.net/sci_tech/unraveling_ust_fountain_spectacle Unraveling UST fountain spectacle], retrieved 29 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Quattromondial'' ====
An artwork and piece of structure was unveiled for the Quadricentennial celebrations last January 27, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Archt Orlina&quot;&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/2011/744-archt-orlina-signs-accord-to-build-tetraglobal-sculpture.html Archt. Orlina Signs Accord to Build Tetraglobal Sculpture], retrieved 26 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quattromondial''' is a monument built made of bronze and glass. It is a ten-meter-high structure made by artist '''Ramon Orlina''', a UST alumnus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Countdown to 2011 begins&quot;&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20091216/countdown_to_2011_begins Countdown to 2011 begins], retrieved 26 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The monument features four figures representing the young Filipino student, the young Filipina student, the Thomasian teacher, and the Dominican monk-scholar. These were modeled by actor '''Piolo Pascual''' (''Filipino student''), Orlinaâs daughter '''Monina''' (''Filipina student''), beauty queen '''Charlene Gonzales''' (''Thomasian teacher''), and '''Fr. Rolando V. dela Rosa, O.P.''' (''Dominican friar'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Olazo/Orlina: Of light and delight&quot;&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.net/circle/20101130/olazoorlina_of_light_and_delight Olazo/Orlina: Of light and delight], retrieved 25 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Quattromondial&quot;&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20110123-316039/Quattromondial-UST-embraces-birthright-destiny âQuattromondialâ: UST embraces birthright, destiny], retrieved 24 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the four near-naked figures, whose genitals are covered by a long strip of ribbon, rests a globe; and like the earth, it tilts 23.5 degrees. 

According to Orlina, the four figures represent the four centuries of '''''excellence''''' (Filipino student), '''''erudition''''' (Thomasian teacher), '''''spirituality''''' (Dominican monk) and '''''tradition''''' (Filipina student) that the University has displayed and inspired in every one of its stakeholders. The globe represents globalization, with all its benefits and hindrances, such as environmental degradation and cultural divisions.

The ribbon with an inscription in Latin signifying accomplishment, scholarliness and wisdom streams out of the globe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quattromondial&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:
