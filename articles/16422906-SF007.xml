'''K Desktop Environment 2''' was the second series of releases of the [[K Desktop Environment]] (now called ''KDE Software Compilation''). There were three major releases in this series.

==Major updates==
K Desktop Environment 2 introduced significant technological improvements compared to its predecessor.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.0 announcement&quot;&gt;[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-2.0.php KDE 2.0 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DCOP]] (Desktop COmmunication Protocol), a client-to-client communications protocol intermediated by a server over the standard [[X11]] ICE library.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.0 announcement&quot;/&gt;

[[KIO]], an application [[Input/Output|I/O]] library. It is network transparent and can access [[HTTP]], [[FTP]], [[Point of Presence|POP]], [[IMAP]], [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], [[Server Message Block|SMB]], [[LDAP]] and local files. Moreover, its design permits developers to &quot;drop in&quot; additional protocols, such as [[WebDAV]], which will then automatically be available to all KDE applications. KIO can also locate handlers for specified [[MIME type]]s; these handlers can then be embedded within the requesting application using the KParts technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.0 announcement&quot;/&gt;

[[KParts]], a [[component object model]], allows an application to embed another within itself. The technology handles all aspects of the embedding, such as positioning toolbars and inserting the proper menus when the embedded component is activated or deactivated. KParts can also interface with the KIO trader to locate available handlers for specific MIME types or services/protocols.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.0 announcement&quot;/&gt;

[[KHTML]], an [[HTML]] 4.0 compliant rendering and drawing engine. It supports many Internet technologies, including [[JavaScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], HTML 4.0, [[CSS]] 2, and [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] for secure communications. It is compatible with Netscape plugins such as [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]. KHTML also has the capacity to embed components within itself using the KParts technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.0 announcement&quot;/&gt;

==K Desktop Environment 2.0==
[[Konqueror]] was introduced as web browser, file manager and document viewer. It used KHTML for displaying web pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.0 announcement&quot;/&gt;

K Desktop Environment 2 also shipped with the initial release of the [[KOffice]] suite, consisting of a spreadsheet application ([[KSpread]]), a vector drawing application ([[KIllustrator]]), a frame-based word-processing application ([[KWord]]), a presentation program ([[KPresenter]]), and a chart and diagram application ([[KChart]]). Native file formats were [[XML]]-based. KOffice included a scripting language and the ability to embed individual components within each other using KParts.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.0 announcement&quot;/&gt;

==K Desktop Environment 2.1==
The K Desktop Environment 2.1 release inaugurated the media player [[Noatun (audio)|noatun]], which used a modular, plugin design. For development, K Desktop Environment 2.1 was bundled with [[KDevelop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2.1 announcement&quot;&gt;[http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-2.1.php KDE 2.1 Release Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==K Desktop Environment 2.2==

The KDE 2.2 release featured up to a 50% improvement in application startup time on GNU/Linux systems and increased stability and capabilities for HTML rendering and JavaScript. A number of new plugins were included in Konqueror. [[KMail]] received the addition of IMAP support (including SSL and TLS), while [[KOrganizer]] got native [[iCalendar]] support. Other improvements included a new plugin-based print architecture and a personalization wizard.
