==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Borge was born '''BÃ¸rge Rosenbaum''' in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, into a Jewish family. His parents, Bernhard and Frederikke Rosenbaum, were both musiciansâhis father a [[Viola|violist]] in the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kglteater.dk/site/OmKunstarterne/Ensembler/Det_Kongelige_Kapel/Tidslinjen.aspx | title = Det Kongelige Teater â Kort fortalt | accessdate =3 October 2010 | language = Danish | quote = My father played in the orchestra for more than 30 years â we couldn't recognise him, when he came home. (Om Bernhard Rosenbaum, som var bratschist i Kapellet fra 1888â1919 sagde Victor Borge: &quot;Min far spillede i Kapellet i over 30 Ã¥r â vi kunne heller ikke kende ham, da han kom hjem&quot;.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother a pianist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krak1964&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his mother, Borge began piano lessons at the age of two, and it was soon apparent that he was a prodigy. He gave his first piano recital when he was eight years old, and in 1918 was awarded a full scholarship at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]], studying under [[Olivo Krause]]. Later on, he was taught by [[Victor SchiÃ¸ler]], [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]'s student [[Frederic Lamond (pianist)|Frederic Lamond]], and [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]]'s pupil [[Egon Petri]].

Borge played his first major concert in 1926 at the Danish concert-hall Odd Fellow PalÃ¦et (''The Odd Fellow's Lodge building''). After a few years as a classical concert pianist, he started his now famous &quot;stand up&quot; act, with the signature blend of piano music and jokes. He married American Elsie Chilton in 1933, the same year he debuted with his revue acts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen1966&quot;&gt;{{cite book

When the Nazis occupied Denmark during [[World War II]], Borge was playing a concert in [[Sweden]], and managed to escape to [[Finland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sears1986&quot;&gt;{{cite book

===Move to America===
Even though Borge did not speak a word of English upon arrival, he quickly managed to adapt his jokes to the American audience, learning English by watching movies. He took the name of Victor Borge, and, in 1941, he started on [[Rudy Vallee]]'s radio show,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

From then on, fame rose quickly for Borge, who won Best New Radio Performer of the Year in 1942. Soon after the award, he was offered film roles with stars such as [[Frank Sinatra]] (in ''[[Higher and Higher (film)|Higher and Higher]]''). While hosting ''[[The Victor Borge Show]]'' on [[NBC]] beginning in 1946,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Borge's style===
Among Borge's other famous routines is the &quot;Phonetic Punctuation&quot; routine, in which he recites a story, with full [[punctuation]] (comma, period, exclamation mark, etc.) as exaggerated onomatopoeic sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=He had several famous verbal routines. One was inflationary language. Borge wondered if prices kept increasing, ... Perhaps the favorite with most people was phonetic punctuation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borge used physical and visual elements in his live and televised performances. He would play a strange-sounding piano tune from sheet music, looking increasingly confused; turning the sheet upside down, he would then play the actual tune, flashing a joyful smile of accomplishment to the audience (he had, at first, been literally playing the actual tune upside down). When his energetic playing of another song would cause him to fall off the piano bench, he would open the seat lid, take out the two ends of an automotive seatbelt, and buckle himself onto the bench, &quot;for safety.&quot; Conducting an orchestra, he might stop and order a violinist who had played a sour note to get off the stage, then resume the performance and have the other members of the section move up to fill the empty seat while they were still playing. His musical sidekick in the 1950s, [[Leonid Hambro]], was a well-known concert pianist. In 1968, classical pianist [[Åahan Arzruni]] joined him as his straightman, performing together on one piano a version of [[Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2|Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody]], considered a musical-comedic classic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyArTMtgT1w&amp;feature=related YouTube â Victor Borge â Hungarian Rhapsody #2 &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

He also enjoyed interacting with the audience. Seeing an interested person in the front row, he would ask them, &quot;Do you like good music?&quot; or &quot;Do you care for piano music?&quot; After an affirmative answer, Borge would take a piece of sheet music from his piano and say, &quot;Here is some&quot;, and hand it over. After the audience's laughter died down, he would say, &quot;That'll be $1.95&quot; (or whatever the current price might be). He would then ask whether the audience member could read music; if the member said yes, he would ask a higher price. If he got no response from the audience after a joke, he would often add &quot;...when this ovation has died down, of course&quot;. The delayed punch line to handing the person the sheet music would come when he would reach the end of a number and begin playing the penultimate notes over and over, with a puzzled look. He would then go back to the person in the audience, retrieve the sheet music, tear off a piece of it, stick it on the piano, and play the last couple of notes from it.

Making fun of modern theater, he would sometimes begin a performance by asking if there were any children in the audience. There always were, of course. He would sternly order them out, then say, &quot;We do have some children in here that means I can't do the second half in the nude. I'll wear the tie. (pause) The long one. (pause) The very long one, yes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=Lx4n9P4bLEo&amp;feature=related YouTube â Victor Borge â Funny Jokes -Part 1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his stage shows in later years, he would include a segment with opera singer [[Marilyn Mulvey]]. She would try to sing an aria, and he would react and interrupt, with such antics as falling off the bench in &quot;surprise&quot; when she hit a high note. He would also remind her repeatedly not to rest her hand on the piano. After the routine, the spotlight would fall upon Mulvey and she would sing a serious number with Borge accompanying in the background.

===Later career===
[[File:Victor Borge footstone 800.jpg|thumb|The footstone of Victor Borge]]
Borge appeared on ''[[Toast of the Town]]'' hosted by [[Ed Sullivan]] several times during 1948. He became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States the same year. He started the ''[[Comedy in Music]] '' show at [[John Golden Theatre]] in New York City on 2 October 1953. ''Comedy in Music'' became the longest running one-man show in the history of theater with 849 performances when it closed on 21 January 1956, a feat which placed it in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Young1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Victor Borge continued to tour until his last days, performing up to 60 times per year when he was 90 years old.

===Other endeavors===
Borge made several appearances on the long running TV show ''[[What's My Line?]]'', both as a celebrity panelist, and as a contestant with the occupation &quot;poultry farmer&quot;; Starting in the 1950s, as a businessman, Borge raised and popularized [[Cornish-Rock|Rock Cornish hens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-Ps0H6Fwro | title = YouTube â Victor BorgeâWhat's My Line: | accessdate =2 October 2010 | date = 11 October 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borge helped start several trust funds, including the Thanks to Scandinavia Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/26/classified/paid-notice-deaths-borge-victor.html?ref=victor_borge | title = Paid Notice â Deaths BORGE, VICTOR â Paid Death Notice â NYTimes.com: | accessdate =2 October 2010 | quote = Thanks To Scandinavia is profoundly saddened by the passing of its co-founder and National Chairman Victor Borge.

Victor Borge's unique combination of concert pianist and sit-down comedian â an intoxicating mixture of melodies and mirth â has made him a living legend for most of the 20th century. His ability to puncture the pretensions of humanity in general, musicians in particular, whether he's lampooning stuffy conductors or grandiose concert pianists, remains undiminished, seventy years after his professional debut. As every good musician and comic knows, it's all in the timing and Borge is a master. He holds the Guinness Book of Records citation for longest-running one-man show in the history of the theater, with 849 performances on Broadway of his &quot;Comedy in Music,&quot; which began in 1952.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
