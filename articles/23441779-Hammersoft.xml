'''Joshua Elia Williams''' (born 3 September 1986), known by his [[stage name]] '''J. Williams''', is a [[New Zealand]] [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] recording artist and professional [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] dancer. He made his musical debut in 2008 with the hit single &quot;[[Blow Your Mind (J.Williams song)|Blow Your Mind]]&quot; which gained him success on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|RIANZ Chart]], peaking at number 13. In early 2009 ''[[Young Love]]'' his debut album was released with the single &quot;[[You Got Me (J.Williams song)|You Got Me]]&quot; featuring [[Scribe (rapper)|Scribe]] reaching number one. The single was certified platinum and was the #1 selling single of 2010 in [[New Zealand]].

==Biography==
Williams was born on 3 September 1986 in [[Mangere]], [[Auckland]]. He is of [[Samoans|Samoan]] and [[Fijian people|Fijian]] descent. He attended Weymouth Intermediate School in Weymouth, [[South Auckland]]. He compares his upbringing to that of the [[Jackson 5]] family, as his father was very strict when it came to devoting yourself to religion and music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muzic.net.nz/artists/genre/5/2451.html Interview with muzic.net.nz]&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' has two older sisters, [[Emily Williams]] and [[Lavina Williams]], who have both entered ''[[Australian Idol]]''.

Williams is a member of the hip hop street dance group originally called Dziah, but now known as Prestige. In [[2006]] Dziah represented [[New Zealand]] at the [[World Hip Hop Dance Championships]], held in [[Los Angeles]], [[United States|U.S.]]. They came in second place to the current champs, the [[Philippine All Stars]] and took home the silver medals. In 2008 at the same competition, this time under the name Prestige, they came in fourth place, narrowly missing out on the bronze medals.

In 2011 it was revealed that Williams was physically assaulting his partner, stylist Larissa Brown.
The pair ended their two-year relationship shortly before the birth of their child Ryder. Friends had noticed bruises on Brown, and many had noted Williams assaulting Brown in public. Police had been called around to their [[Mount Wellington, Auckland|Mount Wellington]] home because of the abuse, and had noted injuries including fractures. [[Women's Refuge]] condemned his behaviour and the fact he was not accepting responsibility, instead blaming it on alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powley_violence&quot;&gt;{{Cite news
