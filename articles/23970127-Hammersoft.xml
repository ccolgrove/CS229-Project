==Recording process==
When [[Richie Sambora]] recorded the solo for this song, he played a very melodic, [[Beatles]]-esque break. But as soon as the song debuted at radio, many fans expressed dismay at the lack of a guitar solo. In response to this criticism, Sambora recorded a new guitar solo to appear in both the music video and album versions of the song.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}
