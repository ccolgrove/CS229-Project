'''Devis Mema''' (born 13 February 1985 in [[KorÃ§Ã«]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.joueurs.devis.mema.50357.en.html Devis Mema footballdatabase.eu Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Albania]]n [[association football|football]]er. The [[striker]] currently plays for [[KS Flamurtari VlorÃ«]] in the [[Albanian Superliga]].

==Career==
Mema was born in [[KorÃ§Ã«]] but started off his playing career with [[Partizani Tirana]] in 2003. He then moved to play for the team of his birthplace, [[KS Skenderbeu Korce]]. At this club he spent a year and a half after joining in the summer of 2004 and leaving in January 2006 to join [[Apolonia Fier]]. He played in Fier for a season and a half and left to join [[Flamurtari VlorÃ«]] in the summer of 2007.

=== Flamurtari ===
Following his move to the [[VlorÃ«]] club in 2007, Mema has been able to quickly established himself in the first team. He made his debut for the club on the opening day of the season on 25 August 2007 in a home match against [[KF Tirana]]. Mema started the game up front with [[Arlind Rustemi]] but was subtituted in the 70th minute for the player who proved to be the match winner, [[Franc Veliu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.match.flamurtari.kf-tirana.218723.en.html Mema Flamurtari debut]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2007-2008 season he played a total of 29 league games and became the club's top goalscorer for the season with 9 goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballdatabase.eu/listematchs.php?joueur=50357&amp;saison=2007/2008&amp;club=2616&amp;competition=1&amp;lieu=Albanie&amp;datedebut=0&amp;datefin=0&amp;type=0 2007-2008 Season games and goals]&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2008-2009 campaign Mema struggled compared to his first season with the club due to injuries and the arrival of fellow [[strikers]] [[Elham Galica]] and [[Eleandro Pema]]. He managed to play just 17 games and scored only 2 goals in the league.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballdatabase.eu/listematchs.php?joueur=50357&amp;saison=2008/2009&amp;club=2616&amp;competition=1&amp;lieu=Albanie&amp;datedebut=0&amp;datefin=0&amp;type=0 2008-2009 games and goals]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not all bad news for the [[striker]] because he did manage to help the team to the victory over [[KF Tirana]] in the final of the [[Kupa e shqipÃ«risÃ«]]. Mema's equaliser came in the 65th minute following good work down the right hand side of the pitch by [[Hair Zeqiri]]. [[Flamurtari]] went on to win the game and the trophy after [[Hair Zeqiri]]'s goal in injury time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footballdatabase.eu/football.coupe.kf-tirana.flamurtari.97545.en.html Cup final win for Flamurtari]&lt;/ref&gt;
