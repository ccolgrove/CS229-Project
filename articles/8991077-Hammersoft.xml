The '''2003 Penn State Nittany Lions football team''' represented the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in the [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003 college football season]]. The team's head coach was [[Joe Paterno]]. It played its home games at [[Beaver Stadium]] in [[University Park, Pennsylvania]].

==Preseason==
The offense returns five starters, including quarterback [[Zack Mills]], who was on pace for a record-shattering season before injuring his left throwing arm, and with the emergence of [[Larry Johnson (American football)|Larry Johnson]], the Nittany Lions practically stopped throwing the ball. But in addition to losing Johnson, who won the [[Maxwell Award]], the [[Doak Walker Award]], the [[Walter Camp Award]], and finished third in the [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting, the offensive unit also loses its leading receiver [[Bryant Johnson]] and four starters on the offensive line. Top candidates to replace Johnson include junior [[Mike Gasparato]] and true freshmen [[Austin Scott (football)|Austin Scott]] and [[Tony Hunt]]. Defensive tackle [[Levi Brown (offensive tackle)|Levi Brown]] was moved to left tackle to help shore up the offensive line.

Penn State started the season ranked #25 in the [[Coaches Poll|Coaches]] college football preseason poll and was unranked in the [[Associated Press|AP]] college football preseason poll.

==Post season==
Penn State finished the season with a 3â9 record, 1â7 in the Big Ten, Paterno's worst ever at Penn State. It was the third losing season in the past four, and only Paterno's fourth losing season since joining the coaching staff in 1950. Nine losses were the most ever for a Penn State team, breaking the record set by the 1931 2â8 team. The season ended without any wins in road games, which hadn't occurred since 1936.

Despite the losing record, Penn State claimed second place in football attendance for the third consecutive season, averaging 105,629 through seven home games, ranking in the top four for the 13th consecutive year. The Ohio State game drew Penn State's largest home crowd of 108,276, the seventh largest crowd ever in Beaver Stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;attendance&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.psu.edu/story/5552|title=Penn State again ranks second in NCAA football attendance|publisher=Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics|date=2004-02-129|accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's second-leading receiver [[Maurice Humphrey]], after a promising season at wide receiver was expelled from school and convicted of three counts of simple assault. Humphrey would not play another down for Penn State.
