In '''Paramount Communications, Inc. v. QVC Network, Inc.''', 637 A.2d 34 (Del. 1994), the Delaware Supreme Court clarified the type of transaction that triggers [[Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, Inc.]] duties.

== Facts ==

This case involved a proposed merger between Viacom and Paramount Productions; as part of the merger agreement, Paramount agreed to an array of defensive measures, including a no-shop provision, $100 million dollar termination fee and a lock-up option on approximately 20% of Paramountâs common-stock. However, QVC intervened with its own, facially more generous merger proposal, conditioned on cancellation of the defensive measures. 
The Paramount Board refused to conduct a formal bidding process with QVC on the grounds that it would be inconsistent with its contractual obligations to Viacom.
