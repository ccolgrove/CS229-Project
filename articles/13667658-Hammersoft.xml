== Education ==
Bowers graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] Medical School in 1986, where she was president of both her class, and the entire student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;babies&quot; /&gt; Bowers later went on to study under the late [[Stanley Biber|Dr. Stanley Biber]], a [[surgeon]] who performed over 4,000 transgender surgeries, and is credited for giving Trinidad the title &quot;Sex Change Capital of the World.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pitpost&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nwi.com/articles/2007/03/05/features/lifestyles/docb14a70da1488819f862572910002fdc7.txt|title=Country's most popular gender-reassignment surgeon has been through it|accessdate=October 18, 2007|publisher=The Associated Press / The Times|year=2007|author=Laura-Claire Corson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;biberobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/18/health/main1216973.shtml |title=Sex Change Doctor Dead At 82 |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |publisher=[[CBS News]] |author=Associated Press/CBS | date=January 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Before moving to Trinidad, Bowers had a successful practice at the PolyClinic in [[Seattle]], and has delivered over 2000 babies.&lt;ref name=&quot;babies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.california-dreamin.org/spages/bowers.html|title=Dr. Marci Bowers|date=April 15, 2007|author=California Dreamin Organization|publisher=California Dreamin Organization|accessdate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt; Bowers has also served as Obstetrics and Gynecology Department Chairperson at Swedish (Providence) Medical Center, and was named the only physician member of the Washington State midwifery Board.&lt;ref name=&quot;babies&quot; /&gt; She was named as one of &quot;America's Best Physicians&quot; for the 2002 to 2003 awards, and is a member-elect of the European Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;babies&quot; /&gt;

When Biber retired in 2003 at the age of 80, Bowers took over his practice, and since then, has done over 300 sexual reassignment surgeries, performing about five operations per week at Mt. San Rafael hospital.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitpost&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;biberobit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rmn&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4398447,00.html |title=Sex-change pioneer a beloved friend, mentor |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |publisher=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |year=2006 |author=Deborah Frazier |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930201554/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4398447,00.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers says her surgeries bring an estimated $1.6 million ([[USD]]) per year to the hospital; she performs an average of 130 surgeries per year &lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt; and charges $21,500 (USD) per [[sex reassignment surgery male-to-female|MTF genital reassignment surgery]], a substantial portion of which covers hospital costs. This surgery is only one of several medical interventions that can be part of [[transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]].

Sex reassignment surgery generally is not performed on persons under the age of 18 in the United States. However, the issue of athletes who change sexes before puberty has been brought up to Bowers, in relation to a minor who had a sex change operation and wished to try out for a [[cheerleading]] team. Bowers was consulted about the issue, and said that most surgeons, including herself, would require patients to wait until they are over the age of 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheer&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-10-17/news/shoulder-pads-pom-poms-and-the-angry-inch.php|title=Shoulder Pads, Pom-Poms, and the Angry Inch|accessdate=October 20, 2007|publisher=Seattle Weekly|year=2007|author=Laura Onstot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Bowers also puts her expertise in vaginoplasty at the disposal of victims of [[female genital mutilation]], whom she does not charge for surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/218692|title=The Kindest Cut: In Colorado, a surgeon helps restore feelingâand so much moreâto victims of female genital mutilation|accessdate=October 27, 2009|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|year=2009|author=Eve Conant}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media appearances ==
In 2004, Bowers appeared in an episode of [[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]] entitled &quot;[[Ch-Ch-Changes (CSI episode)|Ch-ch-changes]]&quot;, which focused on transsexuality, and served as a consultant for the episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot; /&gt;

Bowers has been a guest on the American talk shows [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]], [[The Tyra Banks Show]], and was the subject of a six-part [[BBC]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] series first shown on [[United Kingdom|British]] [[television]] [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oprah.com/tows/slide/200709/20070928/slide_20070928_284_110.jhtml |title=Gender Identity |accessdate=October 10, 2007 |publisher=Harpo Productions, Inc. |author=[[Harpo Productions]], Inc.|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;channel4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/more4/documentaries/doc-feature.jsp?id=145|title=Sex Change Hospital|accessdate=October 12, 2007|publisher=Channel4|year=2007|author=Channel4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary was titled &quot;Sex Change Hospital&quot; and featured her performing [[Sex reassignment surgery|genital reassigments]], as well as covering the back stories of the patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;channel4&quot; /&gt; The series was also shown on Channels 4's spin off channel, [[E4 (channel)|E4]]. Bowers has also been interviewed for a variety of magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;westword&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/2004-07-22/news/the-doctor-is-out/|title=The Doctor is Out|accessdate=November 8, 2007|publisher=Denver Westword News|year=2004|author=Alan Prendergast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marci Bowers was featured in the 2009 documentary, Trinidad, which focused on transsexuals that flock to Trinidad, Colorado to have [[gender reassignment surgery]].  The independent film has appeared on the Showtime movie network.

==Controversy==
Not all of Trinidad's residents are happy with the town's title of &quot;Sex Change Capital&quot;; Terry Keith, a pastor for the All Nations Fellowship church, commented: &quot;Our reputation as sex-change capital of the world has brought shame and reproach on the community,&quot; in an interview with the Pueblo Chieftain in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt; That same year, two pastors petitioned to have the clinic shut down, citing a study done by [[Johns Hopkins University]] that they claimed proved surgery was not successful in treating gender identity issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;exp&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.expmagazine.com/midatlantic/?p=73|title=Trans Surgeon Keeps Small Town Top Destination|accessdate=2007-11-08|publisher=EXP Magazine|year=2006|author=Jacob Anderson-Minshall }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt;

Bowers countered that the church misrepresented the study data, explaining, &quot;If you look at the actual study itself, the satisfaction rates and happiness rates after [surgeries] were overwhelmingly positive, their interpretation of the study was that the respondentsâthe patients themselvesâcouldnât possibly be accurate about what they were feeling, because they were crazy in the first place. Thereâs been nothing like it sinceâand itâs very important to point out that itâs from 1972.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;exp&quot; /&gt;

==Personal life==
Bowers was named Mark at birth, and first attempted the transition from man to woman at the age of 19, but was unsuccessful due to a lack of family support and funds.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt; Twenty years later, she successfully completed the procedure.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt; Bowers married eleven years prior to her surgery, and remains married to her female spouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah&quot; /&gt; They have three children, and while they no longer have a conventional marital relationship, Bowers says they are &quot;closer than sisters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot; /&gt; During her spare time, Bowers likes to play [[golf]], read, cook and travel to Seattle to visit her children.&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt; She was also shown on a [[Discovery Health Channel]] one-hour LGBT-themed special about two transsexual women transitioning and their stories, &quot;Switching Sexes: The Aftermath&quot;.

{{quote|&quot;Transitioning is like walking on lily pads: You have to be careful with each step, or you're going to sink. It takes a lot of money, courage and a certain amount of planning, I'm just glad I can help.&quot; - Marci Bowers&lt;ref name=&quot;nwi&quot; /&gt;}}

Bowers notes on her website that she is a [[vegetarian]].
