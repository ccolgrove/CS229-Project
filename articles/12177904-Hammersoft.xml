[[General (Australia)|General]] '''John Stuart Baker''', [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]], [[Distinguished Service Medal (Australia)|DSM]] (24 February 1936 â 9 July 2007) was an [[Australia]]n army general. He was [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief]] of the [[Australian Defence Force]] from July 1995 to July 1998. From 1990 to 1992, he was Director of the [[Defence Intelligence Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/dio/about.html DIO Directors], [[Australian Defence Force]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Baker joined the [[Australian Army]] in 1954, where he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1957, enlisting with the [[Royal Australian Engineers]] corps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,22045082-1702,00.html Former ADF chief General Baker dies], ''[[The Australian]]'', 9 July 2007. Retrieved 10 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; later graduating from the [[University of Melbourne]] with a degree in [[civil engineering]].

His first regimental posting was a one-year appointment in [[Papua New Guinea]]. This was followed by a stint with the 1st Australian Civil Affairs Unit during the [[Vietnam War]], where he was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1971, Colonel in 1979, Brigadier in 1982, Major General in 1987 and General in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atse.org.au/index.php?sectionid=386 Supporting Australian Defence], Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Baker Report==

In 1987, Chief of the Defence Force General P. C. Gration tasked the then Brigadier Baker to:&lt;ref&gt;Gration, P.C. &quot;A Study into the ADF Command Arrangements - Terms of Reference&quot; CDF 620/1987, 11 Aug 87&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''conduct a study of the existing ADF command arrangements in order to recommend further development to meet likely requirements into the 21st century for both low and high levels of operations''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;One of the principal aims of this study was to determine the optimal command arrangements for ADF air power. The final report, commonly referred to as the Baker Report, was published in March 1988. Despite extensive reference being made to the command and control challenges posed by air power, Baker did not provide definitive guidance on how the ADF should structure its command arrangements to optimise the development and employment of air power. However, Chapter 7 of the report strongly advocated the creation of NORCOM, a recommendation that was soon adopted by the ADF.

The Baker Report remains the seminal work on command and control in the ADF.

#All images of him show a significant delay between an award and his wearing a ribbon, and some were not worn at all.

The portrait (1997) hangs at the RAE's School of Military Engineering in Sydney, but was also used at General Baker's funeral in Canberra at the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/media/download/2007/Jul/20070713/index.htm Funeral for Retired Chief of Defence Force General John Stuart Baker, AC, DSM], [[Australian Department of Defence]], 13 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
