Semenya returned to the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics|2011 World Championships]] where she achieved the silver medal in the 800 metres.

==Early life and education==
Semenya was born in Ga-Masehlong, a village in [[South Africa]] near [[Polokwane|Pietersburg]] (now Polokwane), and grew up in the village of Fairlie, &quot;deep in South Africa's northern [[Limpopo]] province.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth certificate backs SA gender&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mail&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1208227/She-wouldnt-wear-dresses-sounds-like-man-phone-Caster-Semenyas-father-sex-riddle-daughter.html |title= 'she wouldn't wear dresses and sounds like a man on the phone': Caster Semenya's father on his sex-riddle daughter |date=23 August 2009|publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]'' |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;She has three sisters and a brother, and is said to have been a [[tomboy]] as a child.&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=23000&amp;ATCLID=204778766|title=Caster Semenya's present and future|last=Abrahamson|first=Alan|date=20 August 2009|publisher=[[Universal Sports]]|accessdate=30 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===2008===
In July Semenya participated in the [[2008 World Junior Championships in Athletics|2008 World Junior Championships]], and won the gold in the 800 m at the [[2008 Commonwealth Youth Games]] with a time of 2:04.23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=6&amp;click_id=4&amp;art_id=nw20081016164120337C414633 |title= Young SA team strikes gold|date=16 October 2008|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]]|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009===

In the [[2009 African Junior Athletics Championships|African Junior Championships]] Semenya won both the 800 m and 1500 m races with the times of 1:56.72 and 4:08.01 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanathletics.org/?p=245|title=Nigerian Ogoegbunam completes a hat trick at Africa Junior Championships|last=Ouma|first=Mark |date=2 August 2009|publisher=AfricanAthletics.org|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/news/kind=100/newsid=52412.html|title=South African teen Semenya stuns with 1:56.72 800m World lead in Bambous&amp;nbsp;â African junior champs, Day 2|last=Ouma |first=Mark |date=31 July 2009|publisher=[[IAAF]]|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With that race she improved her 800 m personal best by seven seconds in less than nine months, including four seconds in that race alone.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fordyce/&gt; The 800 m time was the world leading time in 2009 at that date.&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tomfordyce/2009/08/semenya_left_stranded_by_storm.html |title= Semenya left stranded by storm |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |author=Tom Fordyce |date=19 August 2009|accessdate=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a national record and a championship record. Semenya simultaneously beat the Senior and Junior South African records held by [[Zelda Pretorius]] at 1:58.85, and [[Zola Budd]] at 2:00.90, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaaf.org/news/kind=100/newsid=52412.html South African teen Semenya stuns with 1:56.72 800m World lead in Bambous â African junior champs, Day 2] IAAF, 31 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF) says it was &quot;obliged to investigate&quot; after she made improvements of 25 seconds at 1500 m and eight seconds at 800 m&amp;nbsp;â &quot;the sort of dramatic breakthroughs that usually arouse suspicion of [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|drug use]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CSRWaW&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2009/aug/23/caster-semenya-athletics-gender Caster Semenya row: 'Who are white people to question the makeup of an African girl?

This is not the first time the IAAF has asked for gender verification although generally the athletes maintain their privacy.

The IAAF's handling of the case spurred many negative reactions. A number of athletes, including retired sprinter [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]], criticized the organization for its response to the incident.&lt;ref name=Dismiss&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/8212078.stm| title=Semenya dismissive of gender row |publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8212835.stm| title=South African unite behind gender row athlete |publisher=BBC News|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent South African civic leaders, commentators, politicians, and activists characterized the controversy as [[Racism|racist]], as well as an affront to Semenya's privacy and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-africa-runner26-2009aug26,0,4216318.story| title=Caster Semenya, South African runner subjected to gender test, gets tumultuous welcome home|first=Robyn|last=Dixon|date=26 August 2009|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/6073980/Gender-row-over-Caster-Semenya-makes-athlete-into-a-South-African-cause-celebre.html |title= Gender row over Caster Semenya makes athlete into a South African cause celebre |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|date=23 August 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2009 | location=London | first1=Patrick | last1=Sawer | first2=Sebastian | last2=Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAAF said it only made the test public after it had already been reported in the media, denying charges of racism and expressing regret about &quot;the allegations being made about the reasons for which these tests are being conducted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CSRWaW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=1053584 SA to take up Semenya case with UN]{{dead link|date=September 2011}} ''The Times SA'', 21 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The federation also explained that the motivation for the test was not suspected cheating but a desire to determine whether she had a &quot;rare medical condition&quot; giving her an unfair competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=SAfury&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8211319.stm|title=SA fury over athlete gender test |publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 August 2009|accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the IAAF stated that the case could have been handled with more sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/8219937.stm| title=New twist in Semenya gender saga|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=25 August 2009|accessdate=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with South African magazine ''[[YOU]]'' Semenya stated, &quot;God made me the way I am and I accept myself.&quot; She also took part in a [[makeover]] with the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8243553.stm| title=Makeover for SA gender-row runner|publisher=BBC News|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=8 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 7 September 2009, Wilfred Daniels, Semenya's coach with Athletics South Africa (ASA), resigned because he felt that ASA &quot;did not advise Ms. Semenya properly&quot;.

&lt;!--Please DO NOT add speculation even alleged leaks about her condition without discussing it on the talk page first, even if it is sourced--&gt;

In November 2009 South Africa's sports ministry issued a statement that Semenya had reached an agreement with the IAAF to keep her medal and the prize money.&lt;ref name=SARSVR&gt;Jere Longman [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/sports/20runner.html &quot;South African Runnerâs Sex-Verification Result Wonât Be Public&quot;] ''New York Times'', 19 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry did not say if she would be allowed to compete as a woman but they did note that the IAAF's threshold for when a female is considered ineligible to compete as a woman is unclear.&lt;ref name=SARSVR/&gt;  
In December 2009 [[Track and Field News]] voted Semenya the Number One Women's 800 metre runner of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Track and Field News, 22 December 2009 Vol 8 Number 59&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===
[[File:Caster Semenya 2010 Memorial Van Damme.jpg|thumb|Semenya on the [[2010 Diamond League]] circuit]]
In March 2010 she was denied the opportunity to compete in the local Yellow Pages Series V Track and Field event in [[Stellenbosch]], South Africa, because the IAAF had yet to release its findings from her gender test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/36083164/|title=Semenya announces return to competitive running|accessdate=30 March 2010|publisher=NBC Sports}}{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 July, the IAAF cleared Semenya to return to international competition. The results of the gender tests, however, will not be released for privacy reasons.&lt;ref name=ReturnTrack/&gt; She returned to competition nine days later winning two minor races in [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo News, July 18, 2010: [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100718/ap_on_sp_ot/ath_semenya_comeback Semenya easily wins again in Finland]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 22, 2010, running on the [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|same track]] as her World Championship victory, Semenya started slowly but finished strongly, dipping under 2:00 for the first time since the controversy, while winning the [[Internationales Stadionfest|ISTAF]] meet in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalsports.com/news/article/newsid=489615.html#rudisha+breaks+800m+wr+semenya+wins AP article]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not being on full form, she did not enter the [[2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics|World Junior Championships]] or the [[2010 African Championships in Athletics|African Championships]], both held in July 2010, and opted to target the [[2010 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]] to be held in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;CBC, July 21, 2010: [http://www.cbc.ca/sports/amateur/story/2010/07/21/sp-semenya-commonwealth-games.html Semenya has eyes on Commonwealth Games]&lt;/ref&gt; She improved her season's best to 1:58.16 at the [[Notturna di Milano]] meeting in early September and returned to South Africa to prepare for the Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref&gt;Sampaolo, Diego (2010-09-10).

In September, the British magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' included Semenya in its annual list of &quot;50 People That Matter&quot; for unintentionally instigating &quot;an international and often ill-tempered debate on gender politics, feminism and race, becoming an inspiration to gender campaigners around the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;htanna&quot; /&gt;
