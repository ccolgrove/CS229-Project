'''Atanasio PÃ©rez Rigal''' (born May 14, 1942 in [[Ciego de Ãvila, Cuba]]), more commonly known as '''Tony PÃ©rez''', is a former [[Major League Baseball]] player. He was also known by the nickname &quot;Big Dog,&quot; &quot;Big Doggie,&quot; and &quot;Doggie.&quot;

Until he was traded in December, {{By|1976}}, PÃ©rez was a key member of [[Cincinnati]]'s &quot;[[The Big Red Machine|Big Red Machine]]&quot;. Apart from his years with the Reds (1964â76, 1984â86), he also played for the [[Montreal Expos]] (1977â79), [[Boston Red Sox]] (1980â82) and [[Philadelphia Phillies]] (1983). He finished his career with a .279 [[batting average]], 379 [[home run]]s, 1652 [[runs batted in]] and 1272 [[run (baseball)|runs scored]]. After retiring, PÃ©rez went on to manage the Reds and [[Florida Marlins]]. He currently holds the title of Special Assistant to the General Manager with the Marlins. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2000|2000]].

==Early career==
Tony PÃ©rez was named as the Most Valuable Player in the [[Pacific Coast League]] in {{By|1964}} when he played for the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] (then a [[minor league]] club). Perez hit .309 with 34 home runs and 107 RBI for the Padres. His performance earned him a promotion to the Reds in the homestretch of the 1964 season.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Perez, Topps Baseball Cards, 1968, card number 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

PÃ©rez was selected to his first [[All-Star]] team in {{By|1967}}. The game, played on July 11, 1967, at [[Angel Stadium of Anaheim|Anaheim Stadium]], went into 15 innings and was then the longest All-Star Game in history. (The 2008 All Star Game also went to 15 innings, and is the longest All-Star Game in terms of elapsed time, at four hours 50 minutes.) It was PÃ©rez's home run off future fellow Hall of Famer [[Catfish Hunter]] that propelled the National League to victory. He was subsequently voted the Most Valuable Player of the 1967 All-Star Game.

In {{By|1970}}, PÃ©rez hit the first home run in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. The 1970 campaign was his finest year, statistically: in addition to his 129 RBIs, PÃ©rez hit .317, slugged 40 home runs and scored 107 runs. He came in third in the Most Valuable Player voting behind [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] and winner [[Johnny Bench]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1970.shtml|title=Baseball Awards Voting for 1970|accessdate=2008-09-08 |work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; his Cincinnati Reds teammate who had one of the best offensive seasons in the history of catchers that year (.293/45/148), in addition to winning a Gold Glove.'''

==Big Red Machine==
After playing [[third baseman|third base]] in the early part of his career with the [[Cincinnati Reds]], from {{By|1972}} onward he starred at [[first baseman|first base]]. PÃ©rez was one of the premier RBI men of his generation, driving in 100 or more runs seven times in his 23-year long career. In an eleven-year stretch from 1967 to 1977, PÃ©rez drove in 90 or more runs each year, with a high of 129 RBIs in 1970. During the decade of the 1970s, PÃ©rez was second among all major-leaguers in RBI, with 954, behind only his teammate Johnny Bench.

Beginning in {{By|1970}}, the Reds went to the World Series four times in seven years, winning back-to-back world championships in {{By|1975}} and {{By|1976}}, with PÃ©rez starting at first base. Following the Red's sweep of the Phillies in the {{By|1976}} League Championship Series and [[New York Yankees]] in the [[1976 World Series]] (the only time a team has ever swept the postseason since the League Championship Series was introduced in 1969), PÃ©rez was traded to the Montreal Expos with [[Will McEnaney]] for [[Woodie Fryman]] and [[Dale Murray]]. After his trade, the &quot;Big Red Machine&quot;-- considered one of baseball's all-time greatest teamsâsputtered and never again got into the Series, reaching the playoffs but one more time in {{By|1979}}. [[Sparky Anderson]], the Reds manager during the championships of the 1970s, has stated in many interviews since that PÃ©rez was the leader, and heart and soul of those teams.

After three seasons in [[Montreal]] (in which he hit 46 home runs with 242 RBIs and a .281 batting average), for the {{By|1980}} season, PÃ©rez signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox. In his first season with the Red Sox, he finished in the top ten in the [[American League]] in [[intentional walk]]s (11), home runs (25) and RBIs (105), and won the [[Lou Gehrig Memorial Award]]. Conversely, he also ranked among the top ten in [[strikeout]]s and led all American League batters by grounding into 25 [[double play]]s.

==Big Red Machine reunion==
For the {{By|1983}} season, PÃ©rez reunited with &quot;Big Red Machine&quot; teammates [[Pete Rose]] and [[Joe Morgan]] on the Philadelphia Phillies. Still a feared hitter based on his reputation, PÃ©rez was a reserve player on the 1983 National League Champion Phillies, and batted .242 in his five World Series appearances. Following the season, he returned to the Cincinnati Reds as a free agent, where he remained until his retirement following the {{By|1986}} season.

PÃ©rez was a seven time All-Star who was voted the Most Valuable Player of the 1967 All-Star Game. In a 1976 article in ''[[Esquire magazine]]'', sportswriter Harry Stein published an &quot;All Time All-Star Argument Starter,&quot; consisting of five ethnic baseball teams. PÃ©rez, a [[Cubans|Cuban]], was the third baseman on Stein's Latin team.
(Tony PÃ©rez was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 1998.)

In {{By|2000}}, PÃ©rez was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]. He had the honor of being elected by the Baseball Writers, garnering 385 votes on 499 ballots for a total of 77.15%, just over the three-quarters minimum required for induction. Tony Perez was also inducted into the [[Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum]] Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;HHBM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hispanicbaseballmuseum.com/fme_perez.html|title=Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum |work= |accessdate=2008-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
