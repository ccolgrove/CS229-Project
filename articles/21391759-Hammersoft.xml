The '''1947 Maryland Terrapins football team''' represented the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[college football]] in its [[1947 college football season|27th season]] as a member of the [[Southern Conference]].

[[Jim Tatum]] served as the first-year head coach and replaced [[Clark Shaughnessy]] who had been asked to resign. Tatum replaced Shaughnessy's pass-oriented version of the [[T formation]] with the [[option offense|option-heavy]] [[split-T]] offense. [[Maryland Terrapins football under Jim Tatum (1947â1955)|During his nine-year tenure]] at [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], Tatum would become the [[winning percentage|winningest]] coach in school history. In 1947, he got off to a good start and significantly improved from Shaughnessy's 3â6 record of the season prior.

The highlight of the season was a berth in the [[1948 Gator Bowl]], the first postseason game in school history. NCAA-scoring leader [[Lu Gambino]] ran for 165 yards and scored all three touchdowns for Maryland. The game ultimately ended in a stalemate.

==Game notes==
===South Carolina===
Gambino scored three touchdowns and Maryland firmly held the momentum for the first three quarters. In the final period, South Carolina mounted a comeback attempt. Maryland player Gene Kinney intercepted a pass on the Terrapin 31-yard line to secure the victory, 19â13.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland yearbook, Class of 1948, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delaware===
Delaware entered the game atop a 32-game winning streak. Gambino again scored three touchdowns, with others added by Davis, Idzik, and Targarona. The Blue Hens responded to an 88-yard touchdown run by Gambino with a 90-yard score by Cole.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland yearbook, Class of 1948, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richmond===
Maryland avenged the previous season's loss to Richmond. Gambino scored twice and completed a pass to Simler for the third touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland yearbook, Class of 1948, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duke (#17)===
Maryland fumbles and interceptions helped Duke snap the three-game winning streak. Vernon Seibert scored the Terrapins' only score of the day. It was also the first touchdown ever scored by Maryland against Duke.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland yearbook, Class of 1948, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virginia Tech===
Virginia Tech scored twice in the first quarter after Maryland penalties and a turnover. In the fourth quarter, Maryland mounted a two-touchdown rally to spoil Virginia Tech's homecoming, 21â19. The decisive scores were due to a long Vic Turyn pass to Simler and a 32-yard dash by Idzik. McHugh made all three point after touchdown kicks, which proved to be the margin of victory.&lt;ref&gt;''Terrapin'', University of Maryland yearbook, Class of 1948, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;
