A '''brass band''' is a [[musical ensemble]] generally consisting entirely of [[brass instruments]], most often with a percussion section. Ensembles that include brass and [[woodwind instruments]] can in certain traditions also be termed '''brass bands''' (particularly in the context of [[New Orleans]]-style brass bands), but are usually more correctly termed [[military band]]s, [[concert band]]s, [[wind band]]s or 'brass and reed' bands.

'''Balkan Brass Band''' ({{lang-sr|Ð¢ÑÑÐ±Ð°}}, ''trumpet'') is a distinctive style of music&lt;ref&gt;nationalgeographic.com&lt;/ref&gt; originating in 19th century [[Serbia]] when trumpeters in the [[military]] transposed [[Folk music]] during harsh times.&lt;ref name=&quot;BRADT&quot;&gt;http://books.google.se/books?id=eFVjMocptcYC&lt;/ref&gt; It is popular throughout the [[Balkans]], especially [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]]. The [[Beat_(music)|beats]] are usually fast and accompanied by ''[[kolo (dance)]]''. The performers each have their instrument of the [[orchestra]] and are called ''trubaÄi'' (''ÑÑÑÐ±Ð°ÑÐ¸''). The best known examples of acclaimed music in this style are from [[Goran BregoviÄ]] and [[Boban MarkoviÄ|Boban MarkoviÄ Orkestar]]. The [[Cinema of Serbia|Serbian film maker]] [[Emir Kusturica]] has, through his films ([[Black Cat, White Cat]]), made the style popular in the international community outside the Balkans.

*1 [[Soprano Cornet]] in E{{music|flat}}
*8-10 [[Cornet]]s in B{{music|flat}} (in separate parts for 'Solo', 'Repiano', 2nd and 3rd cornets; there are 4/5 players on the 'Solo' part, one 'Repiano', two 2nd, and two 3rd)

With the exception of the trombones, all of the brass are conical-bore instruments, which gives the British-style brass band its distinctive bright, mellow sound (as opposed to a dark symphonic sound). All parts apart from the Bass Trombone and percussion are now written in Treble Clef.

Brass bands have a long tradition of competition between bands, often based around local industry and communities. In the 1930s brass bands thrived most with around 20,000 brass bands in the U.K.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} British-style brass bands are widespread throughout [[Great Britain]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]] and [[continental Europe]] and are also found in [[North America]]. Annual competitions are held in these countries to select champion bands at various levels of musical competence.

The [[Salvation Army]], part of the Christian church, has deployed brass bands since 1878 and they continue to be an integral part of that organisation. The most well-known Salvation Army brass band is [http://www.theisb.com The International Staff Band] which is based in London.  [[Salvation Army]] bands vary considerably in size and complement as they are based on the local personnel available, some being as small as 6-8 members.  The cornet section of a [[Salvation Army]] band does not include a 'Repiano' and instead of 2nd &amp; 3rd cornets there are 1st &amp; 2nd cornets.  A [[Salvation Army]] band may have 3-6 tenor horns, 2-4 baritones and 2-6 tenor trombones. [[Salvation Army]] bands have a local tradition of training children in brass playing from an early age (starting at 7â8 years old).  In larger Salvation Army churches there will often be a Junior Band for children (7â18 years old) as well as a Senior Band for adults.

===New Orleans===
[[Image:Brassband.jpg|thumb|300px|The Spirit of New Orleans Brass Band performs at the [[French Quarter]] Festival, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], 11 April 2008.]]
The tradition of brass bands in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] dates to the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Traditionally, New Orleans brass bands could feature various instrumentations, often including [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]]s, [[saxophone]]s, [[sousaphone]]s and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].  The music played by these groups was often a fusion between European-styled [[military band]] music and African [[folk music]] brought to the Americas by west African slaves and the idiom played a significant role in the development of traditional [[jazz]]. Early brass bands include the [[Eureka Brass Band]], the [[Onward Brass Band]], the [[Excelsior Brass Band]], the [[Tuxedo Brass Band]], the [[Young Tuxedo Brass Band]], the [[Camelia Brass Band]], and the [[Olympia Brass Band]].

The [[Treme Brass Band]], while not as old, has members who have been influential throughout New Orleans Brass Band music, as well as being renowned in its own right.

A well-known use of these bands is for the New Orleans [[jazz funeral]].

In the 1970s and 1980s, the New Orleans brass band tradition experienced a renaissance, with bands breaking away from traditional stylings and adding elements of [[funk]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and bop to their repertoires.  Some notable exponents of this style of brass band include the [[Rebirth Brass Band]], the [[Stooges Brass Band]], the [[Soul Rebels Brass Band]], [[Youngblood Brass Band]] and the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]]. Also, a number of groups outside the [[United States]] have begun playing this style of music.

The style of the music is often characterized by the use of the [[sousaphone]] in place of a [[Double bass|bass]] to play the [[bass-line]]. The sousaphone may play a traditional jazz [[walking bass-line]] or groove on a riff. Trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and other horns play melodies and harmonies loosely over the bass-line. Often the lines are greatly embellished with improvisation. A typical setup includes two percussionists, one playing a [[marching snare drum]] and another playing a bass drum and a cymbal. Many variations on this exist, including the use of additional percussionists, cymbals, drums and whistles.

The style has moved beyond New Orleans and can now be found in such places as Japan with the [[Black Bottom Brass Band]]; the Netherlands with the [[Happy Feet Brassband|Happy Feet]] and the [[Hurricane Brass Band|Hurricane]] brass bands; [[Phoenix, Arizona]] with the [[Bad Cactus Brass Band]]; [[Boston, Massachusetts]] with the [[Hot Tamale Brass Band]]; [[Minnesota]] with the [[Jack Brass Band]]; [[Missouri]] with the [[Funky Butt Brass Band]]; [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with the [[Half Dozen Brass Band]]; [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] with [[The Cincy Brass]]; and [[Madison, Wisconsin]] with the [[Mama Digdown's Brass Band|Mama Digdown's]] and [[Youngblood Brass Band|Youngblood]] brass bands.

===Polynesia===
Founded in 1836 by King Kamehameha III, the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]] is the second oldest and only full-time municipal band in the United States. In recent generations, unique brass band traditions have also developed in [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], and other parts of Polynesia, as well as among the [[MÄori people|MÄori]] of New Zealand. Some recordings are now available and these styles are beginning to be researched and promoted abroad through band tours.

==Festivals around the world==
One festival featuring brass bands is the [[Tarragona international dixieland festival]], in Catalonia, Spain. The organisation programs not only dixieland brass bands but also ethnic or world music brass bands from over the world, including the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]] from the USA, [[Boban MarkoviÄ]] Orkestar from Serbia, the Jaipur Kawa Brass Band from India and Taraf Goulamas from [[Occitania]] France.

In the United States the [[Great American Brass Band Festival]] has been held annually in [[Danville, Kentucky]] for the past 18 years. This event, held in early June, attracts brass band lovers from the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

The [http://www.nabba.org North American Brass Band Association] sponsors an annual convention that provides member bands with the opportunity to compete in a contest format similar to those conducted in the United Kingdom and Europe.

In [[Boston]], and [[Seattle]] a series of festivals called [[HONK!]]  bring together Street Brass Bands (and other related ensembles) from the United States and Canada, and some bands from other parts of the world. The groups presented include [[Balkan Brass Band]]s, New Orleans brass bands, Political Action Bands, [[Klezmer]], and &quot;[[DIY]]&quot; Alternative / Radical Community Bands.
