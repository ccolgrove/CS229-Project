Lisa is the first female cadet and therefore gets to stay in her own private barrack. This move creates resentment among the boys at the facility and Bart refuses to speak to his sister. Later, Bart secretly apologizes and helps her train for a test. When Lisa has trouble completing the test Bart publicly encourages her and she passes the test. &lt;br/&gt;Guest star: [[Willem Dafoe]].&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;

The DVD boxset for season eight was released by [[20th Century Fox]] in the United States and Canada on August 15, 2006, nine years after it had completed broadcast on television. As well as every episode from the season, the DVD release features bonus material including [[deleted scene]]s, [[Traditional animation#Animatic|Animatics]], and commentaries for every episode. As with the previous season, the set was released in two different packagings: a &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; plastic packaging molded to look like Maggie's head, and a standard rectangular cardboard box featuring Maggie looking through a photo album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaseinfo.cfm?ReleaseID=5875 |title=The Simpsons - The Complete 8th Season (Maggie Head) |accessdate=2008-03-14|publisher=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaseinfo.cfm?ReleaseID=5874 |title=The Simpsons - The Complete 8th Season (Regular) |accessdate=2008-03-14 |publisher=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The menus continue the same format from the previous three seasons, and the overall theme is various characters posing for photographs.
