'''Mongoose''' (Herpestidae) are a [[family (taxonomy)|family]] of 33&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Terry A.; James M. Ryan; Nicholas J. Czaplewski (2010). ''Mammalogy''. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning. p. 300. ISBN 0763762997&lt;/ref&gt; living species of small [[carnivora]]ns from southern [[Eurasia]] and mainland [[Africa]]. Four additional species from [[Madagascar]] in the subfamily [[Galidiinae]], which were previously classified in this family, are also referred to as &quot;mongooses&quot; or &quot;mongoose-like&quot;. Genetic evidence indicates that the Galidiinae are more closely related to other Madagascar carnivorans in the family [[Eupleridae]], which is the closest living group to the true mongooses.

==Name==
The word ''mongoose'' is derived from the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] name ''{{lang|mr-Latn|mangus}}'' ({{lang|mr|à¤®à¤à¤à¥à¤¸}}) (pronounced as {{IPA|[mÉÅÉ¡uËs]}}), perhaps ultimately from [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] (cf. [[Telugu language|Telugu]] ''{{lang|te-Latn|mungeesa}}'' ({{lang|te|à°®à±à°à°à°¿à°¸}}), [[Kannada]] ''{{lang|kn-Latn|mungisi}}'' ({{lang|kn|à²®à³à²à²à²¿à²¸à²¿}}). The form of the English name (since 1698) was altered to its ''-[[:wikt:goose|goose]]'' ending by [[folk-etymology]].  It has no etymological connection with the word ''goose''. The plural form is ''mongooses'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Mongoose | title=Dictionary.com: mongoose | accessdate=2008-08-22}}''&lt;/ref&gt; or, rarely, ''mongeese''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/mongoose | title=Merriam-Webster: mongoose | accessdate=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been spelled ''mungoose''.&lt;ref&gt;Lydekker, R. 1894. A hand-book to the Carnivora. Part 1, Cats, civets, and mungooses. London: Allen.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Mongooses live in southern  [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and southern [[Europe]], as well as some [[Caribbean]] and [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian]] islands, where they are an [[introduced species]]. 

There are more than thirty [[species]], ranging from {{convert|1|-|4|ft}} in length. Mongoose range in weight from the [[squirrel]]-sized [[Common Dwarf Mongoose]], at {{convert|10|oz|g|abbr=on}}, to the [[cat]]-sized [[White-tailed Mongoose]], at {{convert|9|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.

Some species lead predominantly solitary lives, seeking out food only for themselves, while others travel in groups, sharing food among group members.

==Anatomy==
[[Image:Herpestes.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Herpestes lemanensis]]'' skull, [[MusÃ©um national d'histoire naturelle]], Paris|alt=Photo of long, flat, old and scarred skull]] 
Mongooses bear a striking resemblance to [[mustelids]], having long faces and bodies, small rounded [[ear]]s, short legs, and long tapering [[tail]]s.  Most are [[brindled]] or grizzly; few have strongly marked coats. They have non-retractile claws that are used primarily for digging. Mongooses, much like [[goat]]s, have narrow, ovular [[pupils]]. Most species have a large anal scent gland, used for territorial marking and signaling reproductive status. The [[dentition|dental formula]] of mongooses is similar to that of [[Viverridae|viverrids]]:{{DentalFormula|upper=3.1.3-4.1-2|lower=3.1.3-4.1-2}}. 
Mongooses also have receptors for [[acetylcholine]] that, like the receptors in snakes, are shaped so that it is impossible for snake [[neurotoxin]] venom to attach to them.  Researchers are investigating whether similar mechanisms protect the mongoose from [[hemotoxin|hemotoxic]] snake venoms.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Stephen.  [http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15320642.500-science--mongooses-secret-is-to-copy-its-prey.html &quot;Science: Mongoose's secret is to copy its prey&quot;]; [[New Scientist]]; 11 January 1997.  Retrieved 16 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weasel lookalike===
The mongoose has a very similar appearance to the [[weasel]], despite not being closely related. Their long sleek bodies and short fur fit them for similar ecological niches. They live in similar climates and both burrow underground. Like weasels, mongooses also have short legs and tails.

==Life history==
In contrast to the [[arboreal]], [[nocturnality|nocturnal]] viverrids, mongooses are more commonly terrestrial and many are active during the day. 

The Egyptian Mongoose (''Herpestes ichneumon'') is sometimes held as an example of a solitary mongoose, though it has been observed to work in groups.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Herpestes_ichneumon.html | title=Animal Diversity Web: ''Herpestes ichneumon'' | accessdate=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Meerkat]] or Suricate (''Suricata suricatta''), a smaller species, lives in troops of 20 to 30 consisting of an [[alpha (biology)|alpha]] male and female, usually together with their siblings and offspring, in open country in Southern Africa ([[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]]). The Meerkat is a small, [[diurnality|diurnal]] mammal that forages for [[invertebrate]]s in open country. Its behavior and small size (it weighs less than {{convert|2|lb}} make it vulnerable to larger carnivores and birds of prey. However, it eats small, migrating birds. 

To protect the foraging troops from predators, one Meerkat serves as a [[sentinel]] that climbs to a  vantage point and watches for danger. If the sentinel detects a predator it gives a loud alarm to warn the troop and indicate whether the threat comes from the air or the ground. If from the air, the meerkats rush to the nearest hole. If from the ground, the troop flees, but they are more able to evade terrestrial predators than raptors.

===Diet===
Mongooses mostly feed on [[insect]]s, [[crab]]s, [[earthworm]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[chicken]]s, and [[rodent]]s. However, they also eat [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s and [[carrion]]. 

The [[Small Asian Mongoose|Indian Mongoose]] and others are well-known for their ability to fight and kill [[venomous snake]]s, particularly [[cobra]]s.  They are adept at such tasks due to their agility, thick coat, and mutated [[acetylcholine]] receptors, which render them resistant or immune to snake venom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/89/16/7717.long | title=How the Mongoose Defeats the Snake | accessdate = 2010-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They typically avoid the cobra and have no particular affinity for consuming its meat.&lt;ref name=Mondadori&gt;

Some species can learn simple tricks. They can be [[domestication|domesticated]] and are  kept as pets to control [[vermin]]. However, they can be more destructive than desired: when imported into the [[Caribbean|West Indies]] to kill [[rat]]s and snakes, they destroyed most of the small, ground-based [[fauna]]. For this reason, it is illegal to import most species of mongoose into the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.fws.gov/newsreleases/LACYBANS.html | title=Animals whose importation is banned under the Lacey Act | accessdate=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]], and other countries. Mongooses were introduced to [[Hawaii]] in [[1883]], and have had a significant negative effect on native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://starbulletin.com/2004/02/25/news/story7.html | title=Star Bulletin: Traps set to catch mongoose on Kauai | accessdate=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
The mongoose emits a high-pitched noise, commonly known as giggling, when it mates. Giggling is also heard during courtship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buzzle.com/articles/mongoose-facts.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with humans==
Mongooses are a common spectacle at roadside shows in  [[Pakistan]]. [[Snake charming|Snake charmers]] keep mongooses for mock fights with snakes. In [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]], mongooses fight [[habu]], or vipers (a local, venomous member of the ''[[Trimeresurus]]'' species), in a closed perimeter while spectators watch. However, due to pressure from [[animal rights]] activists, the spectacle is less common today.

According to Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1.35 &amp; 1.87), Egyptians venerated native mongooses (''[[Herpestes ichneumon]]'') for their ability to handle venomous snakes and for their occasional diet of [[crocodile]] eggs.

The Buddhist god of wealth [[VaiÅravaá¹a]], or Dzambala for Tibetans, is frequently depicted holding a mongoose that is spitting jewels from its mouth.

[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s story &quot;[[Rikki-Tikki-Tavi]]&quot; features a pet mongoose that saves its human family from two deadly [[cobra]]s. The story was later made into several films.

A mongoose also features in [[Bram Stoker]]'s novel, ''[[The Lair of the White Worm]].'' The main character, Adam Salton, purchases one to independently hunt snakes.

Mongooses were used in research into creating [[artificial skin]]. Mongooses were given grafts of a [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]-based polymer in an attempt to create a semi-permeable skin-like membrane which could be used to treat burn victims.

==Taxonomy==
[[Image:Serengeti Mongoose.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Common Dwarf Mongoose|Dwarf Mongoose]] (''Helogale parvula'')]] 

Like other [[feliformia]]n carnivorans, mongooses descended from the [[Miacoidea|viverravines]], which were [[civet]]- or [[genet (animal)|genet]]&amp;ndash;like mammals. Older classifications sometimes placed mongooses in the [[Viverridae]] family, but both morphological and molecular evidence speaks against the [[monophyly]] of this group, though they do have the same basic dental formula as the viverrids. Mongooses also have characteristic behavioral features that distinguish them from viverrids and other feliformian families. Less diverse than the viverrids, the mongoose family includes 14 genera and 33 species.

The ''Helogale pervula'' (common dwarf mongoose) is closely related to the family Hyaenidae (hyenas), Viverridae (civets) and Felidae (cats). The species that come from their common ancestor also relate them more closely to canines than to the family [[Mustelidae]], which contains [[weasel]]s, [[badger]]s and [[otter]]s. 

Genetic evidence indicates that the family [[Eupleridae]], is the closest living group to mongooses. Eupleridae contains the species [[fossa (animal)|Fossa]].

Genetic evidence from several [[nuclear DNA|nuclear]] and [[mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] genes argues against placing Malagasy [[Galidiinae]] in the mongoose family; instead, these species are more closely related to other Madagascar carnivorans, including the Fossa and [[Malagasy civet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yoder |first=A.
