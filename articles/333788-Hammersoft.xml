'''[[Numbered highway]]s in [[Canada]]''' are split by province, and a majority are maintained by their province or territory transportation department. All highways in Canada are numbered except for three in the Northwest Territories, and all in Nunavut; one highway in Alberta, one highway in Ontario, two highways in Quebec, and Ontario's [[Provincial highways in Ontario#Others|7000 Series]], are not marked with their highway number, but have been assigned one by the transportation department. A number of highways in all provinces are better known by locals by their name rather than their number. Some highways have additional letters added to their number, A is typically an [[alternate route]], B is typically a [[business route]], and other letters are used for [[Bypass (road)|bypass (truck) routes]], [[Connector (road)|connector routes]], [[scenic route]]s, and [[spur route]]s.
