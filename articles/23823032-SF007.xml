A '''controversy surrounding the [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] cryptographic key''' arose in April 2007 when the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA) began issuing [[demand letter]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;chill&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/notice.cgi?sID=03218|title=AACS licensor complains of posted key|accessdate=2007-05-04|publisher=[[Chilling Effects (group)|Chilling Effects]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to websites publishing a 128-[[bit]] (16-[[byte]]) number, represented in [[hexadecimal]] as '''09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.zdnet.co.uk/blog/0,1000000567,10005286o-2000331777b,00.htm|title=An interesting sales tactic|accessdate=2007-05-18|date=11 May 2007|author=[[Rupert Goodwins]]|publisher=[[ZDNet]] UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inquire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1018487/09-f9-02-9d-e3-5b-d8-41-56-c5-63-56-c0-tried-ban|title=09 f9 &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the number they tried to ban|accessdate=2007-05-03|date=2 May 2007|author=Nick Farrell|publisher=[[The Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (commonly referred to as '''09 F9'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/05/09-f9-legal-primer|title=09 f9: A Legal Primer|accessdate=2007-05-18|date=2 May 2007|author=Fred von Lohmann|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-tech-today.com/news/09-F9--An-Unlikely-Star-Is-Born/story.xhtml?story_id=011001CEELPZ|title=09 F9: An Unlikely Star Is Born Thanks to Digg.com|accessdate=2007-05-18|date=5 May 2007|author=Frederick Lane|publisher=Sci-Tech Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] for [[HD DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s. The letters demanded the immediate removal of the key and any links to it, citing the anti-circumvention provisions of the U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA).

In response to widespread Internet postings of the key, the AACS LA issued various press statements, praising those websites that complied with their requests as acting in a &quot;responsible manner&quot;, warning that &quot;legal and technical tools&quot; were adapting to the situation.

The controversy was further escalated in early May 2007, when aggregate news site [[Digg]] received a DMCA [[cease and desist]] notice and then removed numerous articles on the matter and [[banhammer|banned]] users reposting the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/insiderreports/2007/05/02/digg-embroiled-in-hd-dvd-controversy|title=Digg Embroiled In HD DVD Controversy|accessdate=2007-05-18|date=2 May 2007|author=David Utter|publisher=WebProNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This sparked what some describe as a digital revolt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,21659892-27317,00.html|title=Digg revolt over HD DVD codes|accessdate=2007-05-20|date=2 May 2007|publisher=news.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;cyber-riot&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/technology&amp;id=5269200|title=The First Amendment vs. Patents in Web 2.0|accessdate=2007-05-20|date=3 May 2007|author=Michael S. Malone|publisher=6abc}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which users posted and spread the key on Digg, and throughout the Internet ''en masse'', thereby leading to the [[Streisand effect]]. The AACS LA described this situation as an &quot;interesting new twist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-AACS-response&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6623331.stm|title=DRM group vows to fight bloggers |accessdate=2007-05-04|date=4 May 2007|author=Darren Waters |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Hexadecimal]] is a base-16 [[numeral system]] used in the fields of [[computer programming]] and [[mathematics]]. The key is an ordinary number most widely known by its hexadecimal representation; in [[decimal]] notation, it is 13,256,278,887,989,457,651,018,865,901,401,704,640.&lt;ref&gt;Read as: &quot;thirteen undecillion, two hundred and fifty-six decillion, two hundred and seventy-eight nonillion, eight hundred and eighty-seven octillion, nine hundred and eighty-nine septillion, four hundred and fifty-seven sextillion, six hundred and fifty-one quintillion, eighteen quadrillion, eight hundred and sixty-five trillion, nine-hundred and one billion, four hundred and one million, seven hundred and four thousand, six hundred and forty&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the encryption key may be used as part of [[circumvention device|circumvention technology]] forbidden by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]], its possession and distribution has been viewed as illegal by the [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]], as well as by some legal professionals.&lt;ref name=&quot;chill&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/03/technology/03code.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007-05-02 |last=Stone |first=Brad |accessdate=2007-05-03 |title=In Web Uproar, Antipiracy Code Spreads Wildly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is a 128-[[bit]] [[number|numerical]] value, it was dubbed an [[illegal number]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloggernews.net/16450 Blogger News Network / âIllegal Numberâ Triggers Flood of MPAA Cease-and Desist Letters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecyrd.com/ButtUgly/wiki/Main_blogentry_010507_1 ButtUgly: Main_blogentry_010507_1&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bearnz.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/an-illegal-number/ Protected Blog Login Â« WordPress.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to the expansion of the scope of [[copyright]] criticize the idea of making a particular number illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=May 3, 2007 | url=http://freedom-to-tinker.com/node/1154 | title=Why the 09ers Are So Upset | work=Freedom to Tinker | author=[[Edward Felten]] | accessdate=2007-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs integrate copy protection technology specified by the AACS LA. There are several interlocking encryption mechanisms, such that cracking one part of the system does not necessarily crack other parts. Therefore, the &quot;09 F9&quot; key is only one of many parts that are needed to play a disc on an unlicensed player.

The AACS system can be used to revoke a key of a specific playback device, after it is known to have been compromised, as it has for [[WinDVD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AACS key revoked&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070126-8710.html | title = AACS key revoked | accessdate = 2007-05-02 | date = 26 January 2007|publisher=Ars Technica|author=Ken Fisher }}&lt;/ref&gt; The compromised players can still be used to view old discs, but not newer releases without encryption keys for the compromised players. If other players are then cracked, further revocation would lead to legitimate users of compromised players being forced to upgrade or replace their player software or [[firmware]] in order to view new discs. Each playback device comes with a [[binary tree]] of secret device and processing keys. The processing key in this tree, a requirement to play the AACS encrypted discs, is selected based on the device key and the information on the disc to be played. As such, a processing key such as the &quot;09 F9&quot; key is not revoked, but newly produced discs cause the playback devices to select a different valid processing key to decrypt the discs.&lt;ref name=&quot;hal finney&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://financialcryptography.com/mt/archives/000908.html|title=Hal Finney on 'AACS and Processing Key'|author=Hal Finney|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=2007-05-18|authorlink=Hal Finney (cypherpunk)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline of AACS cracking ==
=== 2006 ===
On December 26, 2006, a person using the alias ''muslix64'' published a utility named [[BackupHDDVD]] and its [[source code]] on the DVD decryption [[Internet forum|forum]] at the website ''[[Doom9]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=119871 | title = BackupHDDVD, a tool to decrypt AACS protected movies | accessdate = 2007-04-09 | date = December 26, 2006 | author = Muslix64 | work = Doom9's Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt; BackupHDDVD can be used to decrypt AACS protected content once one knows the encryption key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aacsla.com/specifications/AACS_Spec_HD_DVD_Recordable_0.921_20060725.pdf | title = Advanced Access Content System (AACS) | accessdate = 2007-04-09 | date = 2006-07-25 | author = [[Intel Corporation]] | coauthors = [[International Business Machines Corporation]], [[Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.]], [[Microsoft Corporation]], [[Sony Corporation]], [[Toshiba Corporation]], [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Warner Bros.]] | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; muslix64 claimed to have found title and volume keys in main memory while playing HD DVDs using a software player, and that finding them is not difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2006-12-28 | url=http://www.techamok.com/?pid=1849 | title=HD DVD Content Protection already hacked? | work=[[TechAmok]] | accessdate=2007-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007 ===
On January 1, 2007, muslix64 published a new version of the program, with volume key support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.doom9.org/showpost.php?s=61e391f4db570e16e4f05a98ffa97f6d&amp;p=924731&amp;postcount=245 | title = BackupHDDVD, a tool to decrypt AACS protected movies | accessdate = 2007-04-09 | date = 2 January 2007 | author = Muslix64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2007, other forum members detailed how to find other title and volume keys, stating they had also found the keys of several movies in [[random access memory|RAM]] while running [[WinDVD]].

On or about January 13, a title key was posted on [[pastebin]].com in the form of a riddle, which was solved by entering terms into the [[Google]] search engine. By converting these results to hexadecimal, a correct key could be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/13/181222 | title = Decryption Keys For HD-DVD Found, Confirmed | accessdate = 2007-04-09 | date = January 13, 2007 | author = &quot;kad77&quot; | work = Slashdot }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, the first cracked HD DVD, ''[[Serenity (film)|Serenity]]'', was uploaded on a private torrent tracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070115-8622.html| title=First pirated HD DVD movie hits BitTorrent| first=Jeremy | last=Reimer | date= 2007-01-15| publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AACS LA confirmed on January 26 that the title keys on certain HD DVDs had been published without authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | date = January 26, 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6301301.stm | title = Hi-def DVD security is bypassed | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2007-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doom9.org forum user ''arnezami'' found and published the &quot;09 F9&quot; AACS processing key on February 11:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=952954#post952954 | title = Processing Key, Media Key and Volume ID found!!! | accessdate = 2007-05-04 | date = 11 February 2007 | author = arnezami | work = Doom9's Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Nothing was hacked, cracked or even reverse engineered btw: I only had to watch the &quot;show&quot; in my own memory. No debugger was used, no binaries changed.}}

This key is not specific to any playback device or DVD title. Doom9.org forum user ''jx6bpm'' claimed on March 4 to have revealed [[CyberLink]]'s [[PowerDVD]]'s key, and that it was the key in use by [[AnyDVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=965425#post965425 | title = PowerDVD private key | accessdate = 2007-04-09 | date = 3 March 2007 | author = jx6bpm | work = Doom9's Forums }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AACS LA announced on April 16 that it had revoked the decryption keys associated with certain software high-definition DVD players, which will not be able to decrypt AACS encrypted disks mastered after April 23, without an update of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 16 April 2007 | url = http://tech.yahoo.com/news/infoworld/20070416/tc_infoworld/87720 | title = HD DVD, Blu-ray protection in question after attacks | publisher = [[Yahoo]] | accessdate = 2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date= 2007-05-03 | author = Rick Merritt | publisher = EETimes | title = The real casualty in high def DVD revolt | accessdate = 2007-05-05 | url = http://www.eetimes.com/news/latest/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199203754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, one week before any discs with the updated processing key had reached retail, claims were reported of the new keys having been retrieved from a preview disc of ''[[The Matrix (series)|The Matrix Trilogy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date= 2007-05-17 | author = Ryan Paul| publisher = Arstechnica | title = Latest AACS revision defeated a week before release | accessdate = 2007-05-17 | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070517-latest-aacs-revision-defeated-a-week-before-release.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 23, the key &lt;tt&gt;45 5F E1 04 22 CA 29 C4 93 3F 95 05 2B 79 2A B2&lt;/tt&gt; was posted on [[Edward Felten]]'s ''Freedom to Tinker Blog''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freedom-to-tinker.com/node/1155#comment-367359 | date = 2007-05-23 | author = BtCB | publisher = Freedom to Tinker | title = You Can Own An Integer Too | accessdate = 2007-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed a week later by ''arnezami'' on Doom9 as the new processing key (MKB v3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1008940 | date = 2007-05-30 | author = arnezami | title = New Processing Key found!!

=== 2008 ===
In August, two new processing keys were posted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=140169 |date=2008-08-08 |author=KenD00 |title=MKBv4 and MKBv6, MKBv7, MKBv8 Processing Keys found |work=Doom9's Forum |accessdate=2009-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;tt&gt;7A 5F 8A 09 F8 33 F7 22 1B D4 1F A6 4C 9C 79 33&lt;/tt&gt;, which appeared to work with MKB v6, MKB v7 and MKB v8 discs.

=== 2009 ===
In March, two additional processing keys were posted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=145789 |date=2009-03-20 |author=KenD00 |title=MKBv9 and MKBv10 Processing Keys found |work=Doom9's Forum |accessdate=2009-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While individual discs have been decrypted containing media key block version 17,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1358273#post1358273 |date=2009-12-31 |author=pynux |title=Post Blu-ray Volume Unique Keys here - post questions in the forum |work=Doom9's Forum |accessdate=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; processing keys for versions past 10 have not yet been released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=1305688#post1305688 |date=2009-07-16 |author=Doom9 |title=DumpHD - a HD-DVD / Blu-Ray Decrypter |work=Doom9's Forum |accessdate=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== DMCA notices and Digg ==
{{Wikinews|Digg.com suffers user revolt}}
[[Image:HD DVD Night Digg Frontpage before rose blog post screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of the Digg front page during the user revolt; all stories are related to the HD DVD key.]]
As early as April 17, 2007, AACS LA had issued [[DMCA]] violation notices, sent by Charles S. Sims of [[Proskauer Rose]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Aftermath of the Digg Revolt: What now?&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.the-trukstop.com/articles/2007/aftermath_of_digg_revolt.html | author= Davies, Greg | publisher = TheTrukstoP.com | title = The Aftermath of the Digg Revolt: What now? | accessdate = 2007-05-03 | date = May 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DMCATakedown&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chillingeffects.org/anticircumvention/notice.cgi?NoticeID=7180 | title = DMCA Takedown Notice | accessdate = 2007-05-02 | date = April 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, dozens of notices were sent to various websites hosted in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;AACS Takedowns Backfire&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/31859/97/ | title = AACS Takedowns Backfire | accessdate = 2007-05-02 | date = May 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2007, in response to a DMCA demand letter, technology news site [[Digg]] began closing accounts and removing posts containing or alluding to the key. The Digg community reacted by creating a flood of posts containing the key, many using creative ways of semi-directly or indirectly inserting the number, such as in song or images (either representing the digits pictorially or directly representing bytes from the key as colors) or on merchandise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Digg Revolt&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/05/02/0235228 | title = Digg.com Attempts To Suppress HD-DVD Revolt | accessdate = 2007-05-02 | date = May 1, 2007 | work=[[Slashdot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Digg's &quot;entire homepage was covered with links to the HD-DVD code or anti-Digg references.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Digg's DRM Revolt|author=Andy Greenberg|date=May 2, 2007|publisher=[[Forbes]]|url=http://www.forbes.com/technology/2007/05/02/digital-rights-management-tech-cx_ag_0502digg.html|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Digg administrators reversed their position, with founder Kevin Rose stating:

=== Legal opinions ===
&lt;!-- For describing notable third party legal opinion on the matter; i.e., not speculation please! --&gt;
Lawyers and other representatives of the entertainment industry, including Michael Avery, an attorney for [[Toshiba]] Corporation, expressed surprise at Digg's decision, but suggested that a suit aimed at Digg might merely [[Streisand effect|spread the information more widely]].
{{cquote|If you try to stick up for what you have a legal right to do, and you're somewhat worse off because of it, that's an interesting concept.|||Michael Avery, Toshiba Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/03/business/fi-revolt3|title=User rebellion at Digg.com unearths a can of worms|accessdate = 2007-05-04|date = May 3, 2007|author=Alex Pham|coauthors=Joseph Menn|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] (latimes.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[American Bar Association]]'s ''[[eReport (ABA)|eReport]]'' published a discussion of the controversy,&lt;ref name=&quot;abanet&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.abanet.org/journal/ereport/my11blog.html|title=Itâs No Secret: Code Stirs Up a Web Storm: Lawyers question whether Web site can be forced to remove posts|date=May 11, 2007|accessdate=2007-05-11|publisher=[[American Bar Association|ABA]] ''[[eReport (ABA)| ]]''|author=Stephanie Francis Ward}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Eric Goldman at [[Santa Clara University]]'s High Tech Law Institute noted that the illegality of putting the code up is questionable (that [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]] may protect the provider when the material itself is not copyrighted), although continuing to allow posting of the key may be &quot;risky&quot;, and entertainment lawyer [[Carole Handler]] noted that even if the material is illegal, laws such as the DMCA may prove ineffective in a practical sense.

== Impact ==
In a response to the events occurring on [[Digg]] and the call to &quot;Spread this number&quot;, the key was rapidly posted to thousands of pages, blogs and [[wiki]]s across the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rudd-o.com/archives/2007/04/30/spread-this-number/|title=Spread this number |accessdate=2007-05-02|date=30 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-May/070489.html |title = HD DVD key and the spam blacklist |accessdate=2007-05-04|date=2 May 2007|author=Tim Starling|publisher=[http://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikien-l WikiEN-L mailing list]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction has been likened to the [[Streisand effect]]; when attempts to censor the key were made by Digg management in response to [[DMCA]] notices, people reacted by posting the encryption key ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techdirt.com/articles/20070501/202154.shtml|title=AACS Discovers The Streisand Effect: The More You Try To Suppress Something, The More Attention It Gets|author=Mike Masnick|accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intellectual property]] lawyer Douglas J. Sorocco noted, &quot;People are getting creative. It shows the futility of trying to stop this. Once the information is out there, cease-and-desist letters are going to infuriate this community more.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abanet&quot;/&gt; Outside of the Internet and the [[mass media]], the key has appeared in or on T-shirts, poetry, songs and music videos, illustrations and other graphic artworks,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired-photoshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/multimedia/2007/05/crackkdown_protest |title=Photoshop Rebels Rip Great HD DVD Clampdown |work=[[Wired News]] |date=2007-05-03 |accessdate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; tattoos and body art,&lt;ref name=&quot;Arstechnica-aacs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070504-aacs-la-internet-revolt-be-damned-this-fight-is-not-over.html |title=AACS LA: Internet &quot;revolt&quot; be damned, this fight is not over

In an opposing move, Carter Wood of the [[National Association of Manufacturers]] said they had removed the &quot;Digg It&quot;-link from their weblog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shopfloor.org/2007/05/03/intellectual-property-dust-up-digg/|title=Intellectual Property Dust-Up: Digg|author=Carter Wood|date=2007-05-03|accessdate=2008-08-07}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Until the Digg community shows as much fervor in attacking intellectual piracy as attacking the companies that are legitimately defending their property, well, we do not want to be promoting the site by using the &quot;Digg It&quot; feature.}}

Media coverage initially avoided quoting the key itself. However, several US-based news sources have run stories containing the key, quoting its use on Digg,&lt;ref name=&quot;gizmodo&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Buchanan | first = Matt | title = Breaking: Digg Riot in Full Effect Over Pulled HD-DVD Key Story | publisher = Gizmodo | date = 2007-05-02 | url = http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/geeks-will-not-be-silenced/breaking-digg-riot-in-full-effect-over-pulled-hd+dvd-key-story-256982.php  | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gadgetell&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Berger | first = Adam | title = HD-DVD cracked, Digg users causes an uproar | publisher = Gadgetell | date = 2007-05-02 | url = http://www.gadgetell.com/tech/comment/hd-dvd-cracked-digg-users-causes-an-uproar/ | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webpronews&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Beal | first = Andy | title = Rose Hands Over Digg Control | publisher = WebProNews | date = 2007-05-02 | url = http://www.webpronews.com/blogtalk/2007/05/02/rose-hands-over-digg-control | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsfactor&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Lane | first = Frederick | title = Digg This: Web 2.0, Censorship 0 | publisher = Newsfactor.com | date = 2007-05-02 | url = http://www.newsfactor.com/news/Digg-This--Web-2-0--Censorship-0/story.xhtml?story_id=0020006M7M5U | accessdate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Singel | first = Ryan | title = HD DVD Battle Stakes Digg Against Futility of DRM | publisher = [[Wired News]] | date = 2007-05-03 | url = http://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/news/2007/05/digglegal | accessdate = 2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldchanging&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Zuckerman | first = Ethan | title = Does The Number have a lesson for human rights activists? | publisher = [[Worldchanging]] | date = 2007-05-03 | url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006626.html | accessdate = 2007-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
though none are known to have received DMCA notices as a result. Later reports have discussed this, quoting the key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Newitz | first = Annalee | title = Number game | publisher = Metroactive | date = May 23â29, 2007 | url = http://www.metroactive.com/metro/05.23.07/work-0721.html | accessdate = 2007-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Current TV]] broadcast the key during a ''Google Current'' story on the Digg incident on May 3, displaying it in full on screen for several seconds and placing the story on the station website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.current.tv/google/GC03104 | title=Can You Digg It? | author=[[Conor Knighton]] |date = 2007-05-03 &lt;!--15:00 --&gt;|accessdate=2007-05-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070507063341/http://www.current.tv/google/GC03104 |archivedate = May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia, on May 1, 2007, locked out the page named for the number &quot;to prevent the former secret from being posted again. The page on HD DVD is locked, too, to keep out The Number.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiredcom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2007/05/wikipedia_locks/|title=Wikipedia Locks Out &quot;The Number&quot;|accessdate=2010-07-05|publisher=Wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This action was later reversed.

=== AACS LA reaction ===
On May 7, 2007, the AACS LA announced on its website that it had &quot;requested the removal solely of illegal circumvention tools, including encryption keys, from a number of web sites&quot;, and that it had &quot;not requested the removal or deletion of any ... discussion or commentary&quot;. The statement continued, &quot;AACS LA is encouraged by the cooperation it has received thus far from the numerous web sites that have chosen to address their legal obligations in a responsible manner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aacsla&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacsla.com/|title=Home : AACS - Advanced Access Content System|accessdate=2007-05-10|publisher=AACS LA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC News]] had earlier quoted an AACS executive saying that [[blog]]gers &quot;crossed the line&quot;, that AACS was looking at &quot;legal and technical tools&quot; to confront those who published the key, and that the events involving Digg were an &quot;interesting new twist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-AACS-response&quot; /&gt;
