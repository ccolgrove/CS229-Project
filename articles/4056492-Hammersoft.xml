{{Nihongo|'''Mie Hama'''|æµç¾æ|Hama Mie|{{IPA-ja|hama mi.e|IPA}}}} (born 20 November 1943) is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] actress, best-known outside Japan for her role as [[Kissy Suzuki]] in the 1967 [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]''.

==Career==
Hama was working as a bus fare collector when she was spotted by producer [[Tomoyuki Tanaka]]. She  went on to become one of the most in-demand actresses in Japan. Notable appearances included [[Toho]] Studio's monster movies such as ''[[King Kong Escapes]]''. By the time she starred in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'', she had made more than 60 movies.

Hama was originally cast to play the character Aki (who was originally named Suki), and her co-star [[Akiko Wakabayashi]] was cast to play Kissy Suzuki. The two actresses were sent to [[London, England|London]] for three months, to be tutored in English. 

Mie Hama and Wakabayashi switched roles, with Hama playing the smaller part of Kissy (although the character was in fact considered the main [[Bond girl]]); both voices were overdubbed in the final film. Due to illness during filming, the actress was doubled in diving scenes by [[Diane Cilento]], [[Sean Connery]]'s wife at the time. Mie Hama said of [[Sean Connery]] and his role as [[James Bond]]: ''&quot;I like Connery. I don't like James Bond. Bond is always a playboy with many playgirls. Connery is a warm heart.&quot;''
