'''''A Knight's Tale''''' is a 2001 American action-adventure film directed, produced, and written by [[Brian Helgeland]]. The film stars [[Heath Ledger]], [[Shannyn Sossamon]], [[Mark Addy]], [[Alan Tudyk]], [[Rufus Sewell]], [[Paul Bettany]] as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], and [[James Purefoy]] as Sir Thomas Colville/[[Edward, the Black Prince]].

The film follows the story of William Thatcher, a peasant masquerading as a knight, along with his companions in the world of medieval [[jousting]]. William poses as a knight and competes in tournaments, winning accolades and acquiring friendships with such historical figures as [[Edward, the Black Prince|Edward, the Black Prince of Wales]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].

The film takes its title from Chaucer's &quot;[[The Knight's Tale]]&quot; in his [[Canterbury Tales]], though the plot of the movie bears more resemblance to [[George R. R. Martin]]'s novella [[The Hedge Knight]]. The film was a box office success, garnering $117,487,473 with a budget of just over $41 million.

==Plot==
Set in late [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Europe]] in the late 1350s, the story begins with the protagonists and squires, William ([[Heath Ledger]]), Roland ([[Mark Addy]]) and Wat ([[Alan Tudyk]]), discovering their master, Sir Ector ([[Nick Brimble]]), dead of bowel problems in the middle of a jousting tournament. He was ahead &quot;three lances to none&quot; and merely had to finish the final round to win the tournament and be awarded the money that was to buy food for them all. While Wat and Roland resign themselves to destitution now that they no longer have Sir Ector's employment and protection, William Thatcher takes the armour, and more importantly the helmet, from Sir Ector's body and poses as the noble to finish the match. William's inexperience is evident, as he receives a lance blow to the face mask, but regardless wins the tournament (and the money) due to Ector's previous lead. This gives William the idea that, with proper training, he and his companions could make a living in jousting.
For a month, William trains with the help of Roland and Wat to improve his balance and aim. After many tries Will is able to joust properly and is therefore ready to compete.

Along the way to his first tournament in [[Rouen]], William and his friends come upon [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[Paul Bettany]]), &quot;trudging&quot; down a road with no clothes or money. William persuades the writer to fake his [[patent of nobility|patents of nobility]], as it is illegal for peasants to joust, and joins the [[jousting]] circuit under the [[assumed name]] of &quot;Sir [[Ulrich von Liechtenstein]]&quot; from [[Gelderland]]. Chaucer is then discovered to have a gambling problem, which William saves him from by paying his debts with his tournament winnings, and therefore gains Geoffrey's true loyalty (and services as a [[herald]] at the tournaments). Helped by Chaucer, Wat and Roland, he begins to win match after match. When his armourâstill the same suit taken from Sir Ectorâbecomes loose and damaged, he gains an addition to his fellowship, Kate the blacksmith ([[Laura Fraser]]), who makes him revolutionary new armour and decides to travel with them. He faces a Sir Thomas Colville ([[James Purefoy]]) in one of his matches and deals him a crippling blow, but rather than finish him off William instead agrees to a draw in order to preserve Colville's honor. William meets and falls in love with a noble lady, Jocelyn ([[Shannyn Sossamon]]), who has already been noticed by the powerful Count Adhemar ([[Rufus Sewell]]), the film's antagonist. A rivalry begins between the two of them for the affection of Jocelyn and the accolades of the tournaments, and Adhemar defeats William in his first tournament.

In the following tournament, they are both assigned to tilt against Sir Thomas Collville but Adhemar withdraws at the last minute after learning his true identity is that of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (who assumed another identity hoping he will get a rare chance to compete if his opponents do not know his identity as the Prince of Wales), not willing to take the risk of harming English royalty. When William's turn comes, however, his competitiveness overcomes the pressure to withdraw, and he jousts with Edward (to Edward's surprise and pleasure) and wins the tournament, along with Edward's respect (because of the respect William has show him in turn on two separate occasions, which the Prince considers an honorable and knightly quality). Following this, Will's companions, Wat, Roland, Kate and Geoff, gamble all of their share of the money that William will win the French tournament in Paris. Simultaneously, Jocelyn tells William that he must lose the tournament to prove his love to her. After he openly accepts defeat after defeat, she changes her mind; he must now win to prove his love. He does win the tournament. After this, Jocelyn joins him in bed.

The group travels to London for the World Championship, and an important flashback to William's childhood is shown. His father, wanting the best for his son, reluctantly gave him over for squire services to Sir Ector, so that someday, he could realize his dream of becoming a knight and &quot;change his stars&quot; to live a better life than his father. Returning to the present, and to London for the first time since childhood, William, assuming that his father has long since died, visits his old neighborhood. He talks to a young local girl, ([[Alice Connor]]), who informs him that his father is still alive and well, albeit blind. William visits his father, initially presenting himself as Ulrich; and tells him that he has a message from William: that he has changed his stars after all. His father, overcome with joyous emotion, realizes it is actually his son, and they embrace and spend hours together.

Although everything appears well, Adhemar has returned from fighting in the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] and discovers William's humble origins. He alerts the authorities. William's friends, including Jocelyn beg him to flee. Jocelyn promises to give up her privileged life and run away with him, but he refuses to run; and is arrested. Adhemar visits him in prison and gloats that he will marry Jocelyn, while beating the defenseless William. When William is moved to the stocks, his companions all stand with him to defend him from the crowd, which grows increasingly hostile until Prince Edward emerges from the mob. Silencing the crowd, and privately noting that William's friends' willingness to stand by him reflects the honour that he has earned, Edward orders William to be released, declaring that his historians have discovered that William is descended from an &quot;ancient royal line&quot; and that he is entitled to a knighthood after all; repaying William for the respect William had previously shown him (as it is the Prince's verdict, none are allowed to argue).  He knights William. The newly dubbed &quot;Sir William&quot; goes on to resume his place in the tournament and compete against Adhemar. 

With Jocelyn and William's father in attendance, Adhemar cheats with an illegal lance with a sharp point on the tip, which stabs into William's shoulder during the first round. William, unable to grip his lance or breathe properly due to his injury, has his armour removed and his lance strapped to his arm while Chaucer buys time by providing the introduction he 'forgot' earlier, and competes in the final round wearing only ordinary clothing. The two adversaries charge for the final bout, with William's life in the balance. He shouts his finally accepted true name, &quot;WILLIAM,&quot; and knocks Adhemar from his horse, winning the tournament. Chaucer remarks that he should write this whole story down, a reference to &quot;The Knight's Tale&quot; of the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. Jocelyn runs out ecstatically to meet William and they embrace in a long kiss.

==Production==
The entire film was filmed in [[Prague]], in the [[Czech Republic]].

The film includes a great deal of [[jousting]] footage. The initial scene of the two knights jousting is actually footage of Heath Ledger's stunt double in an accident. During filming of a later scene in the movie, the lance of the stunt double's opponent moved off target and hit him in the head. The double fell to the ground unconscious. In another incident, Heath Ledger knocked out one of director Brian Helgeland's front teeth with a broomstick when the two were demonstrating a jousting move. It took several months for Helgeland's mouth to heal enough to repair the damage.

Plenty of effort was expended creating [[lance]]s that would convincingly explode upon impact without injuring the stunt riders as well. The body of each lance was scored so it would break easily, and the tips were made of [[ochroma pyramidale|balsa wood]]. Each was also hollowed out, with the holes filled with balsa splinters and uncooked [[linguine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviehabit.com/essay.php?story=helgeland Mapes, Marty. &quot;Interview with Brian Helgeland,&quot; Movie Habit, Sunday, May 6, 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of anachronisms===
In the film's actor/director DVD commentary, [[Brian Helgeland]], co-commentating with Paul Bettany, states that the film was intended to have occurred sometime in the 1370s during a six-month period in which Chaucer had apparently gone missing and show what he might have done during this time, which Helgeland says later on in the commentary inspired Chaucer to write his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''. (The first Canterbury tale is ''[[The Knight's Tale]]''. Chaucer also threatens two men he meets in the film with undying humiliation through fiction; these characters seem to have inspired the vitriolic descriptions of the Tales' [[The Pardoner's Tale|Pardoner]] and [[The Summoner's Tale|Summoner]].)

Helgeland also jokes in the commentary that he chose 1970s music and hairstyles for the movie because &quot;the seventies are always the same&quot;, regardless of century. More seriously, Helgeland justifies his use of music by speculating that even during the 1370s, persons in the main characters' age group would've enjoyed newer, more contemporary music than something that had been around since their great grandparents were young, and opted to use music that would affect the audience the same way late 14th century music would've affected the youth of the 1370s.  Thus, Helgeland attempted to stylize the movie in such a way as to bring the Middle Ages to the audience, rather than force the audience into the Middle Ages.

To this end, many intentional anachronisms are used within the story itself. Jocelyn's appearance combines medieval and modern styles, and the armor Kate makes for William is engraved with a symbol resembling the [[Swoosh|Nike logo]]. In the first jousting scene, when &quot;[[We Will Rock You]]&quot; is playing, the crowd provides the rhythmic ''thump-thump-clap'' as a modern-day crowd that recognizes the song would, the audience performs [[Audience wave|the wave]], and a teenage girl is shown in the stands performing a distinctly twentieth-century dance. At a banquet, Count Adhemar tries to trip up the unsophisticated &quot;Sir Ulrich&quot; by urging him to show the other guests a dance from his own country; William, who's only spent a couple of hours learning to dance that day before the banquet, improvises with Jocelyn and comes up with something suited to a rock video (the featured song in this scene was &quot;[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]&quot; by [[David Bowie]]).

Language is also borrowed from the present day. An extended metaphor involving hunting during William's first conversation with Jocelyn leads to his calling her a &quot;foxy lady.&quot; The first time Chaucer introduces William at a competition, he ends with a comedy-club &quot;Thank you, I'll be here all week&quot; in response to the crowd's wild cheers. When Jocelyn defends herself during an argument with William by saying, &quot;Better a silly girl with a flower than a silly boy with a horse and a stick,&quot; an offended William calls after her, &quot;It's called a ''lance''... hellooo?&quot;

==Music==
The film, which notionally took place during the [[Middle Ages]], is notable for its deliberate use of classic rock songs in its soundtrack. The ten that were credited in the movie are listed in order of appearance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183790/soundtrack |title=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Initially the reception for this film was mixed, with complaints about the [[anachronism]]s (the [[classic rock]] music in a movie that takes place during the [[Middle Ages]]), the many jousting scenes and the thin plot. The aggregate review site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] rated the movie as being 59% fresh along with 80% approval from the audience.

''[[Newsweek]]'' revealed in June 2001 that print ads for at least four movies released by [[Columbia Pictures]], including ''A Knight's Tale'' and ''[[The Animal]]'' (2001), contained glowing comments from a film reviewer who did not exist. The fake critic, [[David Manning (fictitious writer)|David Manning]], was created by a Columbia employee who worked in the advertising department. &quot;Manning&quot; was misrepresented as a reviewer for a newspaper in a small [[Connecticut]] town.
