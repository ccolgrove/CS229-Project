'''Vodafone Turkey''' is a [[List of mobile network operators#Turkey|mobile phone operator]] in [[Turkey]], currently the country's second largest. It had 16 million active subscribers in March 2007 [http://www.vodafone.com/start/media_relations/news/group_press_releases/2007/telsim_completes_transition.html] - approximately a 25% share of the market - and claims to cover just about all urban areas with a population over 5,000. Vodafone Turkey is also the owner of [[KKTC Telsim]] in [[Northern Cyprus]]. On December 13, 2005, it was announced that [[United Kingdom|British]]-based mobile operator [[Vodafone]] had won a [[public auction]] to purchase Telsim, for a price of [[USD|$]]4.5 billion. The old ''Telsim'' brand was phased out on 31 March 2007 in favour of ''Vodafone'', in line with usual practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTVMSNBCstory&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/news/396410.asp |title=1 billion dollar investment from Vodafone |work=NTVMSNBC |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded by the [[Cem Uzan|Uzan Group]] in [[1994]] as '''Telsim''', and remained the only alternative to the  [[Turkcell]] until well into the 2000s. Uzan's mounting debts, particularly its international dispute with [[Motorola]], led to the company being seized by the Turkish State Savings Deposit and Insurance Fund.

Vodafone Turkey has roaming agreements with more than 500 GSM operators.
