The '''PS ''General Slocum''''' was a passenger [[paddle steamer|steamboat]] built at [[Brooklyn]], New York, in 1891. The ''General Slocum'' was named for [[American Civil War|Civil War]] officer and New York [[United States Congress|Congress]]man [[Henry Warner Slocum]]. She operated in the New York City area as an excursion steamer for the next thirteen years under the same ownership. During her service history, she was involved in a number of mishaps, including multiple groundings and collisions.

On June 15, 1904, the ''General Slocum'' caught fire and sank in New York's [[East River]].&lt;ref name=unlucky&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=The General Slocum An Unlucky Craft.

==Construction and design==

The ''General Slocum'' was built by Devine Burtis, Jr., a [[Brooklyn]] boatbuilder who was awarded the contract on February 15, 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogilvie&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| last = Ogilvie| first = J.S.| authorlink =| coauthors =| title = History of the General Slocum Disaster:| work =| publisher =| date =| url = http://www.garemaritime.com/features/general-slocum/| doi =

The ''Slocum'' measured 1,284 [[gross register tonnage|tons gross]],&lt;ref name = Cussler&gt;Cussler, Clive, [http://www.numa.net/expeditions/general_slocum.html General Slocum], National Underwater and Marine Agency.  Retrieved November 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and had a hull depth of {{convert|12.3|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogilvie&quot;/&gt; The ''Slocum'' was constructed with three decks, three watertight compartments and 250 electric lights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ogilvie&quot;/&gt;

''General Slocum'' was powered by a single-[[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], surface condensing [[marine steam engine#Walking beam|vertical beam]] [[steam engine]] with 53 inch [[bore (engine)|bore]] and 12 foot [[stroke (engine)|stroke]], built by [[W. &amp; A.

Steam was supplied by two [[boiler]]s at a working pressure of 52 [[pounds per square inch|psi]].&lt;ref name=nyt_26jun1891&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F10A1FF83C5E10738DDDAF0A94DE405B8185F0D3 &quot;A Very Handsome Boat&quot;], ''The New York Times'', June 26, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Slocum'' was a [[sidewheeler|sidewheel boat]]. Each wheel had 26 paddles and was {{convert|31|ft|m}} in diameter.  Her maximum speed was about  {{convert|16|kn|km/h}}.  The ship was usually manned by a crew of 22, including Captain William H. Van Schaick and two pilots. She was named for [[American Civil War|Civil War]] officer and New York [[United States Congress|Congress]]man [[Henry Warner Slocum]].

==Service history==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
[[File:PS General Slocum by Stanton - detinted.jpg|thumb|275px|Drawing by Samuel Ward Stanton]]
The ''General Slocum'' experienced a series of mishaps following her launch in 1891. Four months after her launching, she ran aground off [[Rockaway Inlet|Rockaway]]. [[Tugboat]]s had to be used to pull her free.

A number of incidents occurred during 1894. On July 29, while returning from Rockaway with approximately 4,700 passengers, the ''Slocum'' struck a [[shoal|sandbar]] with enough force that her [[electrical generator]] went out. The next month, the ''Slocum'' again ran aground off [[Coney Island]] during a storm. During this grounding the passengers had to be transferred to another ship. In September 1894 the ''Slocum'' collided with the tug ''[[R. T. Sayre]]'' in the [[East River]] with the ''General Slocum'' sustaining substantial damage to her steering.

In July 1898 another collision occurred when the ''Slocum'' collided with the ''[[Amelia]]'' near [[Battery Park]]. On August 17, 1901, while carrying what was described as 900 intoxicated Paterson [[Anarchists]], some of the passengers started a riot on board and attempted to take control of the vessel. However, the crew fought back and maintained control of the ship. The captain docked the ship at the police pier and 17 men were taken into custody by the police. In June 1902 the ''General Slocum'' ran aground with 400 passengers aboard. With the vessel unable to be freed, the passengers had to camp out while the ship remained stuck throughout the night.

===The disaster===
[[Image:General slocum burning.jpg|thumbnail|287px|right|Firefighters working to extinguish the General Slocum]]
[[Image:GeneralSlocum 05.jpg|thumb|right|287px|Victims of the General Slocum washed ashore at [[North Brother Island]]]]

The ''General Slocum'' worked as a passenger ship, taking people on excursions around New York City. On Wednesday, June 15, 1904, the ship had been chartered for $350 by [[St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church (New York City)|St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in the [[Little Germany, New York|Little Germany]] district of [[Manhattan]]. This was an annual rite for the group, which had made the trip for 17 consecutive years even as German settlers deserted Little Germany for the Upper East and West Sides. Over 1,400&lt;ref name=&quot;plaque&quot; /&gt; passengers, mostly women and children, boarded the ''Slocum'', which was to sail up the [[East River]] and then eastward across the [[Long Island Sound]] to Locust Grove, a picnic site in [[Eatons Neck]], [[Long Island]].

The ship got underway at 9:30 a.m. As it was passing East 90th Street, a fire started in the Lamp Room&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = O'Donnell | first = Edward | title = &quot;Ship Ablaze: The Tragedy of the Steamboat &quot;General Slocum&quot; | location = New York | publisher = Broadway Books | year = 2003 | pages = 97â98 |isbn = 0767909054 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the forward section, possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match but certainly fueled by the straw, oily rags, and lamp oil strewn around the room.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, pp.98â102.&lt;/ref&gt; The first notice of a fire was at 10:00 a.m.; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a paint locker filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Captain Van Schaick was only notified ten minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had tried to warn him earlier but was not believed.

Although the captain was ultimately responsible for the safety of passengers, no effort had been made to maintain or replace the ship's safety equipment. The fire hoses had been allowed to rot, and fell apart when the crew attempted to put out the fire. Likewise, the crew had never had a fire drill, and the [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]s were tied up (some claim they were wired and painted in place)&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donnell, pp. 108-113&quot;&gt;O'Donnell, pp. 108â113.&lt;/ref&gt; and inaccessible. Survivors reported that the [[Lifebuoy|life preservers]] were useless and fell apart in their hands. Desperate mothers placed [[life jackets]] on their children and tossed them into the water, only to watch in horror as their children sank instead of floating.  Most of those on board were women and children who, like most Americans of the time, could not swim; even victims who did not don the worthless life preservers found that their heavy wool clothing weighed them down in the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donnell, pp. 108-113&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:GeneralSlocum 06.jpg|thumb|right|187px|Carrying away a body from North Brother Island]]
It has been suggested that the manager of the [[life preserver]] manufacturer actually placed iron bars inside the [[Cork (material)|cork]] preservers to meet minimum weight requirements at the time. Many of the life preservers had been filled with cheap and less effective granulated cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers had been manufactured in 1891 and had hung above the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, pp. 118â119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Van Schaick mishandled the situation. He decided to continue his course rather than run the ship aground or stop at a nearby landing. (Van Schaick would later argue he was attempting to prevent the fire from spreading to riverside buildings and oil tanks.) By going into headwinds and failing to immediately ground the ship, he actually fanned the fire. Flammable paint also helped the fire spread out of control.

Some passengers attempted to jump into the river, but the women's clothing of the day made swimming almost impossible. Many died when the floors of the overloaded boat collapsed; others were battered by the still-turning paddles as they attempted to escape into the water or over the sides.&lt;ref name=gentile&gt;Gentile, &quot;Shipwrecks of New Jersey&quot;, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time the ''General Slocum'' sank in shallow water at [[North Brother Island]], just off the [[Bronx]] shore, an estimated 1,021 people had died by fire or drowning, with 321 survivors. 2 of the 30 crew members died. The captain lost sight in one eye owing to the fire. Reports indicate that Van Schaick deserted the ''Slocum'' as soon as it settled, jumping into a nearby [[tug]], along with several crew. Some say his jacket was hardly rumpled, but other reports stated that he was seriously injured. He was hospitalized at [[Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center|Lebanon Hospital]].

There were many acts of heroism among the passengers, witnesses, and emergency personnel. Staff and patients from the hospital on North Brother Island participated in the rescue efforts, forming human chains and pulling victims from the water.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Community Synagogue St. Marks Evangeical Lutheran Church.jpg|thumb|right|The St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church, built in 1857 for the German immigrant community of [[Little Germany, Manhattan|Little Germany]], has been a synagogue since 1940]] 
Eight people were indicted by a Federal [[grand jury]] after the disaster: the Captain; two inspectors; and the president, secretary, treasurer and commodore of the Knickerbocker Steamship Company. Only Captain Van Schaick was convicted. He was found guilty on one of three charges: [[criminal negligence]], failing to maintain proper [[fire drill]]s and [[fire extinguisher]]s.  The jury could not reach a [[verdict]] on the other two counts of [[manslaughter]]. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment.  He spent three years and six months at [[Sing Sing Correctional Facility|Sing Sing]] prison before he was paroled.  President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] declined to pardon Captain Van Schaick, and he was not released until the federal parole board, under the [[William Howard Taft]] administration, voted to free him on August 26, 1911.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;Eric Robinson, [[New-York Historical Society]] Library&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[presidential pardon#United States|pardoned]] by President Taft on December 19, 1912,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Knickerbocker Steamship Company, which owned the ship, paid a relatively small fine despite evidence they might have falsified inspection records. The sunken remains of the ''General Slocum'' were recovered and converted into a [[barge]], which sank in a storm during 1911.

The disaster motivated federal and state regulation to improve the [[Boat_safety#Safety|emergency equipment]] on passenger ships.

The neighborhood of Little Germany, which had been in decline for some time before the disaster,&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, pp. 26â34&lt;/ref&gt; almost disappeared afterwards. With the trauma and arguments that followed the [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]] and the loss of many prominent settlers, most of the Lutheran Germans remaining in the Lower East Side eventually moved uptown. The church whose congregation chartered the ship for the fateful voyage is now a synagogue.

The victims were interred in cemeteries around New York, with fifty-eight identified victims buried in the [[Cemetery of the Evergreens]] in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theevergreenscemetery.com/stories/shirtwaist-fire/the-general-slocum-disaster The General Slocum Disaster Â« The Evergreens Cemetery&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several were buried at Lutheran Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens (now Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery), where an annual memorial ceremony is held.

===Survivors===

On January 26, 2004 the last surviving passenger from the ''General Slocum'', [[Adella Wotherspoon]] (nÃ©e Liebenow), died at the age of 100. At the time of the disaster she was a six-month old child. Mrs. Wotherspoon was the youngest survivor of the tragedy that took the lives of her two older sisters. When she was one year old she unveiled the Steamboat Fire Mass Memorial on June 15, 1905, at Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery, in [[Middle Village, Queens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Unveiling&quot;&gt;
