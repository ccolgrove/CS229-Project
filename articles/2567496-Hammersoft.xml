'''Inverbervie''' ({{lang-gd|Inbhir Biorbhaidh}}) is a small town on the north-east [[coast]] of [[Scotland]], south of [[Stonehaven]], in the [[Aberdeenshire|Aberdeenshire council area]].

The Inverbervie name derives from ''Inbhir Beirbhe'', meaning ''Mouth of the [[Bervie Water|River Bervie]]'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]].

==History==
[[Image:Inverbrevie High St.JPG|thumb|right|King Street, Inverbervie]]
Inverbervie appears in written history at least as far back as the 12th century [[AD]]; in a document relating to Arbroath Abbey, Simon of Inverbervie is noted as having witnessed a charter transferring the lands of Balfeith to the Abbey.  The settlement was formerly a [[royal burgh]] from 1342 to 1975 and a [[parliamentary burgh]] from 1708 to 1950, the former status being conferred by [[David II of Scotland]] for hospitality he and his Queen received when shipwrecked there the previous year when returning from exile.

A small harbour in the town was important in early years but despite improvements by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1819, disappeared by 1830 owing to the build up of the shingle bar at the river mouth.
The first [[Flax mill|flax spinning mill]] in Scotland was established here at the Haughs around 1790 and by 1910 there were nine in operation employing 500-600 workers. As a result of this, the population of the settlement peaked at over 2,500 around the turn of the 20th Century but has since declined owing the downturn in that industry.

The town was within the [[Counties of Scotland|county]] of [[Kincardineshire]] until 1975, when the county was merged into the [[Grampian]] [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|Region]]. The Aberdeenshire [[Council areas of Scotland|unitary council area]], which now includes Inverbervie, was created when the region system was eradicated in 1996. ''Aberdeenshire'' is also the name of another former county which was merged into the Grampian Region in 1975.

Prominent local buildings include [[Hallgreen Castle]], founded in 1376, standing on a bluff overlooking the sea towards the southern end of the town.

==Parliamentary burgh==
The [[parliamentary burgh]] which existed from 1708 to 1950 was a component of the [[Aberdeen Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Aberdeen district of burghs]] of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] from 1708 to 1801 and of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] from 1801 to 1832.

In 1832 Inverbervie became a component of the [[Montrose Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Montrose district of burghs]].

In 1950 it was merged into the [[North Angus and Mearns (UK Parliament constituency)|North Angus and Mearns constituency]]. North Angus and Mearns was replaced with new constituencies in 1983.
With effect from the 2011 Scottish Parliamentary elections, Inverbervie will be back within the Mearns and Angus constituency, following boundary changes.
