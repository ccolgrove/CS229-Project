'''Pico-ITX''' is a PC [[motherboard]] form factor announced by [[VIA Technologies]] in January 2007 and demonstrated later the same year at [[CeBIT]]. The formfactor was transferred over to [[SFF-SIG]] in 2008.  The Pico-ITX form factor specifications call for the board to be 10 Ã 7.2&amp;nbsp;cm (3.9 Ã 2.8 in), which is half the area of [[Nano-ITX]].  The processor can be a [[VIA C7]], a [[VIA Eden]] V4, a [[VIA Nano]] or any other that uses VIA's NanoBGA2 technology for speeds up to 1.5&amp;nbsp;GHz, with 128KB [[L1 cache|L1 &amp; L2 caches]].  It uses [[DDR2]] 400/533 [[SO-DIMM]] memory, with support for up to 1[[Gigabyte|GB]].  Video is supplied via [[AGP]] by VIA's [[UniChrome]] Pro II [[GPU]] with built-in [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4|4]], and [[WMV9]] decoding acceleration.  The [[BIOS]] is a 4 or 8 [[Mbit]] Award BIOS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9265074155.html &quot;Pico-ITX goes &quot;stackable&quot;&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VIA Pico-ITX Whitepaper&quot;&gt;[http://www.via.com.tw/en/downloads/whitepapers/initiatives/spearhead/pico-itx_form_factor.pdf VIA Pico-ITX Whitepaper]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VIA EPIA PX Series Homepage&quot;&gt;[http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/mainboards/motherboards.jsp?motherboard_id=472 VIA EPIA PX Series Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PX10000G ===

The first motherboard that was produced in this form factor is called [[EPIA]] PX10000G. It is 10 Ã 7.2&amp;nbsp;cm (3.9 Ã 2.8 in) and 10 layers deep. The [[operating temperature]] range is from 0[[Â°C]] to about 50Â°C. The [[Humidity#Effects_on_electronics|operating humidity level]] (relative and non-condensing) can be from 0% to about 95%. It uses a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz VIA C7-M processor, a VIA [[VIA_chipsets#Embedded|VX700]] chip set, and is [[RoHS]] compliant.

It has onboard [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] video-out, VIA VT6106S 10/100 [[8P8C]] [[Ethernet]], [[UDMA]] 33/66/100/133 44-pin [[AT Attachment|PATA]] (1x), and [[Serial ATA|SATA]] (1x) [[I/O]].  [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] and LVDS video-out, [[USB 2.0]], [[COM (hardware interface)|COM]], [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] Mouse &amp; Keyboard, and [[HD Audio|HD]] 5.1 channel audio (supplied by a VIA VT1708A chip) are supported through the usage of I/O pin headers and add-on modules/[[daughter card]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;VIA Pico-ITX Whitepaper&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VIA EPIA PX Series Homepage&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://e-itx.com/via-epia-px-px10000g-pico-itx-motherboard.html E-ITX PX10000G Product Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been demonstrated running [[Microsoft]] [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Vista]]. Modern versions of major [[Linux]] distributions, including [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]] 6 and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 7.10, will also run on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2154184680.html &quot;Via's incredible shrinking mobo line spawns &quot;pico-ITX&quot;&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PX5000 ===

This model is similar to the PX10000G, but uses the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz [[VIA Eden]] [[ultra low voltage|ULV]] CPU.

There are two versions of this model, the PX5000G, which has an active (fan-assisted) heatsink, and the PX5000EG, which has a passive (fanless) heatsink.

=== Add-on Modules ===

''(Note: Either the VIA PX-O add-on module or 4 USB 2.0 I/O are supplied in retail packages.)''

The VIA PX-O daughtercard supplies access to:
*1 [[RCA connector|RCA]]-out for [[S/PDIF]] usage
*4 USB 2.0 ports
*1 3.5mm Mic-in, 1 3.5mm line-out, 1 3.5mm line-in
*1 buzzer/speaker
*1 CN9 connector (function TBC)
*1 CN10 connector (function TBC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mini-itx.com/reviews/pico-itx/default.asp?page=1 mini-itx.com Review: &quot;VIA EPIA PX10000 Pico-ITX Review&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--- More information needed on the VT1625M add-on module!
 * Is the external TV-out RCA or S-Video?
 * Same question for the video capture.
 * Can the PX-O &amp; VT1625M cards be used in tandem/at the same time? --&gt;
The VIA VT1625M daughtercard supplies access to:

*S/PDIF-in
*power &amp; HDD activity LEDs
*4 USB 2.0 ports &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logicsupply.com/products/pxfpio Serener PXFPIO Product Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mini-itx.com/store/?c=39#pxdio mini-itx.com VIA PX-DIO Product Section]&lt;/ref&gt;

The VIA PX-TC daughter card, compatible with the PX10000G only, is designed to enhance the multimedia capture and output.  It supplies access to:
*1 S-Video port
*1 video-in port
*1 [[YPbPr]] port
*1 S/PDIF-out &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logicsupply.com/products/px_tc PX-TC Product page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== EPIA-P700 ==

The second motherboard series in this form factor, the P700 series improves upon the PX10000G series by offering a [[Gigabit Ethernet]] (Using the VIA VT6122 chipset) or a 10/100 Ethernet adaptor (VIA VT6107) as a manufacturing option, integrating the power adaptor (allowing for direct +12V DC-In &amp; enabling it to directly power SATA), and making the Ethernet &amp; VGA ports optional via the P700-A daughter card.

Expanded functionality is offered via the following pin I/O:
*1 LAN
*1 VGA/DVI
*1 COM Port
*1 Audio pin connector for Line-out, Line-in, MIC-in
*1 Front panel
*4 USB 2.0
*1 PS2 mouse/keyboard
*1 LVDS
*1 LPC/SM Bus/GPIO (Unusable due to VIA not releasing a GPIO driver)

The EPIA-P700-10L has a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz VIA C7 CPU.

The EPIA-P700-05LE has a 500&amp;nbsp;MHz VIA Eden ULV CPU and has a passive heatsink.

=== Add-on Modules ===

The P700 comes retail with the P700-A &amp; P700-B daughter cards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edageek.com/2008/06/27/via-epia-p700/ &quot;Difference between A/B daughtercards.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The P700-A supplies:
*Gigabit Ethernet
*1 VGA port
*1 COM port
*DVI port via I/O cable

The P700-B supplies:
*4 USB 2.0 ports
*1 Buzzer

==Intel based products==
Even though the form factor was introduced by [[VIA Technologies]], there are also boards available based on [[Intel]] [[processors]]. Some have the [[CPU]] and the [[chipset]] directly on the Pico-ITX board. Other boards, like the Toradex Daisy, allow the addition of Nano COM Express modules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windowsfordevices.com/c/a/News/Toradex-Daisy-supports-Toradex-Robin &quot;Credit-card-sized COM gets carrier board&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pico-ITXe ==
{{main|Pico-ITXe}}

The [[Pico-ITXe]] specification adds on to the Pico-ITX formfactor by taking the EPIA-P700 and upgrading the chipset to a [[VIA_chipsets#Embedded|VX800]], doubling the maximum RAM to 2 GB, allowing for 667/533 SO-DIMM RAM, upgrading the GPU to VIA's [[UniChrome#Chrome9|Chrome9]] HC3, and adding support for [[SUMIT]].  Another notable addition is the expansion from 10 to 12 layers thickness.
