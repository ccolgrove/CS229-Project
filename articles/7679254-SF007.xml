On [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s return to office in 1880, [[William Edward Forster]] was made [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]. He carried the [[Compensation for Disturbance Bill]] through the Commons, only to see it thrown out in the Lords. On 24 January 1881, he introduced a new Coercion Bill in the House of Commons, to deal with the growth of the [[Irish National Land League]].  Despite a 41-hour long [[fillibuster]] in the House by the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], the bill passed, among its provisions being one enabling the British government in Ireland to arrest without trial persons &quot;reasonably suspected&quot; of crime and conspiracy.

==Coercion legislation in Ireland==
Over 100 such acts were passed, some of the more notable of which were &quot;An Act for the more effectual Suppression of Local Disturbances and Dangerous Associations in Ireland&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;1833, 3 Will. IV, c. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Protection of Life and Property in Certain Parts of Ireland Act&quot;,&lt;ref&gt; 1871, 34 &amp; 35 Vict., c. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Protection of Person and Property Act 1881&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;44 &amp; 45 Vict., c. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Irish Coercion Bill was proposed by [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] to calm the increasing difficult situation in [[Ireland]] as a result of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] 1844â47. The Bill was blocked and this led, in part, to Peel's retirement as Prime Minister. Later attempts to introduce Irish coercion acts were blocked by the filibustering of [[Joseph Biggar]].

As a response to the [[Plan of Campaign]] of the mid 1880s the new [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]]  [[Arthur Balfour]] secured a tough Perpetual Crimes Act (1887) (or Coercion Act) aimed at the prevention of [[boycott]]ing, [[intimidation]], [[unlawful assembly]] and the organisation of conspiracies against the payment of agreed rents. The Act resulted in the imprisonment of hundreds of people including over twenty MPs.

The so-called ''Crimes Act'' (or &quot;Coercion&quot; Act) was condemned by the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic hierarchy]] since it was to become a permanent part of the law and did not have to be renewed annually by parliament, but the [[Papacy]] issued the bull [http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_le13sn.htm &quot;Saepe Nos&quot;] in [[1888]] which was uncritical of the Acts. Trial by jury was abolished.

An influential analysis of the pros and cons of the Act was published in [[1888]] by W. H. Hurlbert, a Catholic Irish-American author.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14510 Hurlbert W., &quot;Ireland under Coercion&quot; vol. 1 online] [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14511 vol.2 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many hundreds were imprisoned at times under the Acts, including many prominent politicians and agrarian agitators,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[Joseph Biggar]], [[Alexander Blane]], [[Michael Davitt]], [[John Dillon]], [[James Gilhooly]], [[Patrick Guiney]], [[Matthew Harris (politician)|Matthew Harris]], [[John Patrick Hayden|John Hayden]], [[J.
