'''University of Washington''' is a public research [[university]], founded in 1861 in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[United States]]. The UW is the largest university in the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]] and the oldest public university on the West Coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington by the numbers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington by the numbers|url=http://depts.washington.edu/beahusky/numbers/facts.shtml|accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has three campuses, with its largest campus in the [[University District, Seattle|University District]], [[Seattle]], and two other campuses in [[University of Washington Tacoma|Tacoma]] and [[University of Washington, Bothell|Bothell]]. Its operating expenses for fiscal year 2010 was more than US$ 5.0 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seattle Times&quot;&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014883512_young27m.html Seattle Times, &quot;UW president charming, quick to adapt, always 3 steps ahead&quot; (April 2010)].&lt;/ref&gt; The UW occupies over 500 buildings, with over 20 million gross square footage of space, including the latest [[University of Washington Plaza]] consisting of the 325 ft tall UW Tower and conference center.

In 2011, the University of Washington was ranked 16th worldwide by the ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;top 500&quot;&gt;[http://www.arwu.org/rank2011/ARWU2011_A(EN).htm Top 500 World Universities (2011)] ''Institute of Higher Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University''&lt;/ref&gt; 23rd worldwide by the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]. UW is considered a [[Public Ivy]] university.

==History==
The city of Seattle was one of several settlements in the mid to late 19th century vying for primacy in the newly formed [[Washington Territory]]. In 1854, territorial governor [[Isaac Stevens]] recommended the establishment of a university in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Several prominent Seattle-area residents, chief among them [[Methodist]] preacher [[Daniel Bagley]], saw the siting of this University as a chance to add to the city's prestige. They were able to convince early founder of Seattle and member of the territorial legislature [[Arthur A. Denny]] of the importance of Seattle winning the school. The legislature initially chartered two universities, one in Seattle and one in [[Lewis County, Washington|Lewis County]], but later repealed its decision in favor of a single university in Lewis County, provided locally donated land could be found. When no site emerged, the legislature, encouraged by Denny, relocated the university to Seattle in 1858.

[[File:Territorial University of Washington - c1870.jpg|left|thumb|The original University building on Denny's Knoll, c. 1870]]
In 1861, scouting began for an appropriate {{convert|10|acre|ha|0}} site in Seattle to serve as the campus for a new university. Denny, along with fellow pioneers [[Edward Lander]] and [[Charlie Terry]], donated a site on &quot;Denny's Knoll&quot; in [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown Seattle]]. This tract was bounded by 4th and 6th Avenues on the west and east and Union and Seneca Streets on the north and south.

UW opened officially on November 4, 1861, as the '''Territorial University of Washington'''. The following year, the legislature passed articles formally incorporating the University and establishing a Board of Regents. The school struggled initially, closing three times: in 1863 for lack of students, and again in 1867 and 1876 due to shortage of funds. However, [[Clara Antoinette McCarty Wilt]] became the first graduate of UW in 1876 when she graduated from UW with a [[bachelor's degree]] in science. By the time Washington entered the [[United States|Union]] in 1889, both Seattle and the University had grown substantially. Enrollment had increased from an initial 30 students to nearly 300, and the relative isolation of the campus had given way to encroaching development. A special legislative committee headed by UW graduate [[Edmond Meany]] was created for the purpose of finding a new campus better able to serve the growing student population. The committee selected a site on [[Union Bay (Seattle, Washington)|Union Bay]] northeast of [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown]], and the legislature appropriated funds for its purchase and subsequent construction.

[[File:Uwaerial1922.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial view of the UW campus, dating from 1922 or before]]
The University relocated from downtown to the new campus in 1895, moving into the newly built Denny Hall. The regents tried and failed to sell the old campus, and eventually settled on leasing the area. The University still owns what is now called the [[Metropolitan Tract (Seattle)|Metropolitan Tract]]. In the heart of the city, it is among the most valuable pieces of [[real estate]] in Seattle and generates millions of [[United States dollar|dollars]] in revenue annually.

The original Territorial University building was torn down in 1908 and its former site currently houses the Fairmont Olympic Hotel. The sole surviving remnants of UW's first building are four {{convert|24|ft|m|sing=on}}, white, hand-fluted cedar, Ionic columns. They were salvaged by [[Edmond S. Meany]]--one of the University's first graduates and the former head of the history department. Meany and his colleague, Dean Herbert T. Condon, dubbed each of the columns &quot;Loyalty,&quot; &quot;Industry,&quot; &quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Efficiency,&quot; or &quot;LIFE.&quot; The columns now stand in the Sylvan Grove Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.thedaily.washington.edu/2000/110100/N8.lag.Sylvan.Theatre.jpg |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition - Rainier Vista.jpg|thumb|The [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]]'s lower campus axis toward [[Mount Rainier]]]]
Organizers of the 1909 [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] eyed the still largely undeveloped campus as a prime setting for their [[World's Fair|world's fair]]. They came to an agreement with the Board of Regents that allowed them to use the campus grounds for the exposition. In exchange, the University would be able to take advantage of the development of the campus for the fair after its conclusion. This included a detailed site plan and several buildings. The plan for the A-Y-P Exposition prepared by [[John Charles Olmsted]] was later incorporated into the overall campus master plan and permanently affected the layout of the campus.

Both [[World War]]s brought the military to the campus, with certain facilities temporarily loaned to the federal government. The subsequent post-war periods were times of dramatic growth for the University. The period between the wars saw significant expansion on the upper campus. Construction of the [[liberal arts]] [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]], known to students as &quot;The Quad,&quot; began in 1916 and continued in stages until 1939. The first two wings of [[Suzzallo Library]], considered the architectural centerpiece of the University, were built in 1926 and 1935, respectively. Further growth came with the end of [[World War II]] and passage of the [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]]. Among the most important developments of this period was the opening of the medical school in 1946. It would eventually grow into the [[University of Washington Medical Center]], now ranked by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' among the top ten hospitals in the [[United States]]. It was during this era in University of Washington history in which many Japanese Americans were sent away from the university to [[internment camps]] along the West-coast of the United States as part of [[Executive Order 9066]] following the attacks on [[Pearl Harbor]]. As a result, many Japanese American &quot;soon-to-be&quot; graduates were unable to receive their diplomas and be recognized for their accomplishment at the university until the University of Washington's commemoration ceremony for the [[Japanese Americans]] entitled [[The Long Journey Home]] held on May 18, 2008 at the main campus.

In the early 1950s, the University of Washington Police Department was established. It currently has jurisdiction over the University of Washington campus and University-owned housing, except for the Radford Court apartments in [[Sand Point, Seattle, Washington|Sand Point]].
[[File:Palacio del Conde Luna.jpg|thumb|The University has its [[Spain|Spanish]] headquarters in the old city of [[LeÃ³n, Spain|LeÃ³n]] in collaboration with the [[University of LeÃ³n]].]]
The 1960s and 1970s are known as the &quot;golden age&quot; of the university due to the tremendous growth in students, facilities, operating budget and prestige under the leadership of [[Charles Odegaard]] from 1958 to 1973. Enrollment at UW more than doubledâfrom around 16,000 to 34,000âas the [[post-WW2 baby boom|baby boom]] generation came of age. As was the case at many American universities, this era was marked by high levels of [[student activism]], with much of the unrest focused around opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]. Odegaard instituted a vision of building a &quot;community of scholars&quot; and convinced the state of Washington legislatures to increase their investments towards the university. Additionally, Washington [[United States Senate|senators]], [[Henry M. Jackson]] and [[Warren G. Magnuson]] used their political clout to funnel federal research monies to the University of Washington and to this day, UW is among the top recipients of federal research funds in the United States. The results included an operating budget increase of $37 million in 1958, to over $400 million in 1973, and 35 new buildings that doubled the floor space of the university.

The University opened campuses in [[University of Washington, Bothell|Bothell]] and [[University of Washington, Tacoma|Tacoma]] in 1990. Initially, these campuses offered curricula for students seeking [[bachelor's degree]]s who have already completed two years of higher education, but both schools have transitioned to four year universities, accepting the first freshman class in the fall of 2006. Both campuses offer [[master's degree]] programs as well. In [[2009]] the University opened an office in the [[Spain|spanish]] city of [[LeÃ³n, Spain|LeÃ³n]] in collaboration with the [[University of LeÃ³n|local university]].

==Campus==
{{wide image|Alberg pano - restitch.jpg|1100px|Panoramic view from the Alberg Terrace of the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science &amp; Engineering looking East between the Mechanical Engineering building (left) and Civil Engineering building (right). [[Husky Stadium]] is in the distance to the right.}}

The University of Washington, Seattle campus is situated on the shores of [[Union Bay (Seattle, Washington)|Union]] and [[Portage Bay]]s, with views of the [[Cascade Range]] to the east and the [[Olympic Mountains]] to the west. The main campus is bounded on the west by 15th Avenue N.E., on the north by N.E. 45th Street, on the east by Montlake Boulevard N.E., and on the south by N.E. Pacific Street. East Campus stretches east of Montlake Boulevard to [[Laurelhurst, Seattle, Washington|Laurelhurst]] and is largely taken up by [[wetland]]s and sports fields. South Campus occupies the land between Pacific Street and the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]] which used to be a [[golf course]] and is given over to the [[health sciences]], [[oceanography]], [[Fisheries science|fisheries]], and the [[University of Washington Medical Center]]. West Campus is less of a separate entity than the others, many of its facilities being on city streets, and stretches between 15th Avenue and [[Interstate 5]] from the Ship Canal to N.E. 41st Street. University Way, known locally as &quot;[[The Ave]]&quot;, lies nearby and is a focus for much student life at the university.
[[File:University of Washington Quad, Spring 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Cherry trees in bloom in the Quad.]]
The oldest building on campus is Denny Hall. Built of [[Tenino, Washington|Tenino]] [[sandstone]] in 1895, it is in the [[French Renaissance]] style and named in honor of Seattle pioneers [[Arthur A. Denny|Arthur A.]] and [[Mary Denny]]. It served as the core of the University for many years. The [[Theodore Jacobsen Observatory]], the on campus observatory situated just north of Denny Hall, was built from the left over [[sandstone]] used in the construction of Denny Hall. Although it is rarely used today, the observatory is the second oldest building on campus. After other structures were erected near Denny Hall with apparently little overall planning, the Board of Regents determined that a master plan was needed. Early plans, including a preliminary proposal by [[John Charles Olmsted]], stepson of renowned [[Landscape architecture|landscape architect]] [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], had little impact.

[[File:DennyHall.jpg|thumb|left|Denny Hall]]
Instead, it was the [[Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition]] that defined much of the campus' future layout. The exposition plan, also designed by John C. Olmsted, defined the University's major axis on the lower campus. Oriented to the southeast, it provides the University with its primary vista of [[Mount Rainier]] on clear days. Most of the University's [[science]] and [[engineering]] buildings line this axis.

After the exposition, the Board of Regents sought a master plan that would unite the newly developed lower campus with the original buildings of the upper campus including Denny Hall. Rejecting a further proposal from Olmsted, the regents instead turned to local architects [[Carl F. Gould]] and [[Charles Bebb|Charles H. Bebb]]. Their proposal was accepted, and came to be called the Regents' Plan. It specified a northeast-southwest axis on upper campus around which would be centered the University's [[liberal arts]] departments. This axis joins the lower campus axis laid down during the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition at an open space left behind after a large temporary structure built for the fair was torn down. This space was later paved with a distinctive red brick and has come to be known as [[Red Square (University of Washington)|Red Square]]. Some of the buildings from the exposition were kept by the university and have been retrofitted over the years since. One of these is [[Architecture Hall]].

Bebb and Gould's plan also called for all future construction to adhere to a [[Collegiate Gothic]] style. This style is best exemplified on the University campus by the early wings of [[Suzzallo Library]], the University's central library.

[[File:Drumhellerfountain.jpg|thumb|Drumheller fountain and Mount Rainier]]
New construction in the 1960s saw a deviation from the Collegiate Gothic style as specified in the Regents' Plan. Business facilities on the upper campus, science and engineering structures on lower campus, and a new wing of Suzzallo Library, were all built in a [[modernist]] style, as was a unique, glass-walled building housing an experimental [[nuclear reactor]]. The reactor opened in 1961; a small [[radioactive contamination|radiation]] leak in 1972 resulted only in a temporary shutdown, but security concerns eventually led to it being decommissioned. It was deactivated in 1988, dismantled in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002914016_uwnuke06m.html |title=UW to dismantle nuclear reactor |author=Nick Perry |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=April 4, 2006 |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2008 the building is being considered for demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2008/todays-news/nuclear-reactor.html |title=Midcentury Modern Nuclear Reactor Building May Be Disintegrated |author=Margaret Foster |date=April 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An apparent attempt to harmonize future development with the Regents' Plan can be seen in the University's most recent construction, including the 1990 [[Paul Allen|Kenneth Allen]] wing of the central library and a new generation of medical, science and engineering buildings. Significant funding came from [[Microsoft]] co-founders [[Paul Allen]] and [[Bill Gates]], who have strong family connections to the university but did not attend UW. [[Mary Maxwell Gates|Mary Gates Hall]] opened in May 2000, and in September 2003, the UW law school relocated to the $74 million [[William H. Gates Sr.|William H. Gates]] Hall on the northwest corner of campus, and the $90 million [[University of Washington Medical Center|UW Medical Center]] surgery pavilion opened for operation. The $72 million Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science &amp; Engineering opened in October 2003. In March 2006, the $150 million [[William Foege|William H. Foege]] [[bioengineering]] and genome sciences building was dedicated by [[Bill Gates]] and former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]].

In September 2006, then President Mark Emmert announced that the University had finalized the purchase of the neighboring 22-story Safeco Plaza (a University District landmark) as well as several adjacent buildings for the sum of $130 million. At present, plans are being finalized to relocate UW administration and support services to the complex, leaving the main campus (two blocks away) for teaching and research.

Most of the streets and major walkways on campus are named after the state's [[List of Washington counties|counties]]. Major exceptions are Memorial Way and [[George Washington]] Lane. Memorial Way is named in honor of members of the UW community who died in [[World War I]] and also features a flagpole engraved at its base with the members of the UW community who died in [[World War II]].

Other attractions on campus include the [[Henry Art Gallery]] and the [[Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture]]. The [[Washington Park Arboretum]], south of main campus across [[Union Bay (Seattle)|Union Bay]], is run by the university, though owned by the city of Seattle. The [[Warren G. Magnuson Health Sciences Building|Warren G. Magnuson Health Sciences Center]] is also an interesting attraction. The building, at {{convert|5740200|sqft|m2}}, is the second largest office building in the United States.

Several major motion picture films were filmed on campus or used it as a backdrop, including [[The Sixth Man]], [[WarGames]], and [[What the Bleep!?: Down the Rabbit Hole]].

To promote equal academic opportunity, especially for people of low income, UW launched ''Husky Promise'' in 2006. Families of income up to 65 percent of state median income or 235 percent of federal poverty level are eligible. With this, up to 30 percent of undergraduate students may be eligible. The cut-off income level that UW set is the highest in the nation, making top quality education available to more people. Then UW President, Mark Emmert, simply said that being &quot;elitist is not in our DNA&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inside HigherEd Husky Promise&quot;&gt;[http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/10/13/aid Inside HigherEd Husky Promise]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UW Husky Promise&quot;&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/mediarel/news/promise.shtml UW Husky Promise]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Last year, the University of Washington moved to a more comprehensive approach [to admissions], in which the admissions staff reads the entire application and looks at grades within the context of the individual high school, rather than relying on computerized cutoffs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegejournal.com/aidadmissions/newstrends/20061114-keates.html |title=News &amp; Trends |publisher=CollegeJournal |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, there has been a [[Transition School and Early Entrance Program]] on campus.&lt;ref name=eep&gt;{{cite web| title=The Halbert and Nancy Robinson Center for Young Scholars|url=http://depts.washington.edu/cscy/| accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Early Entrance Program is the Robinson Centerâs original early university entrance program. Recognized as one of the most prestigious early university entrance programs in the nation, this program facilitates early entry to the University of Washington for a carefully selected group of sixteen highly-capable young students younger than fifteen (15) years old. As mandated by state law, students must have completed 6th grade in order to enroll in the Transition School.&quot; This Robinson Center also has a program called the UW [[Academy for Young Scholars]]: &quot;The UW Academy is the premier early university entrance program for high school students in Washington State. A small cohort of up to thirty-five academically advanced and highly motivated students are admitted to the UW Academy each year. Students apply to the UW Academy during their 10th grade year, and if accepted, withdraw from high school at the end of 10th grade to enroll as freshmen at the University of Washington.&quot; All Academy students are automatically admitted into the UW Honors Program.

The student newspaper is ''[[The Daily of the University of Washington]]'', usually referred to as simply ''The Daily''. It is the second largest daily in Seattle and is published every day school is in session during Fall, Winter and Spring quarters, and weekly during Summer quarter.

''The Daily'' earned the 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 Apple Award for the best four-year college newspaper (tabloid) in the United States at the CMA Spring Convention in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegemedia.org/node/106|title=Awards 2007: Apple Award Winners|publisher=College Media Advisors|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards 2008: NYC Convention Accolades |url=http://www.collegemedia.org/node/253|accessdate=2008-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been recognized with the 2007, 2008 &amp; 2009 Mark of Excellence Award for the Best All-Around Newspaper in Region X by the Society of Professional Journalists (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska). It was a finalist for the 2009 Pacemaker Newspaper of the Year, and earned second place for Best of Show at the National College Media Conference held in Austin, Texas.

The Daily launched a half-hour weekly television magazine show, &quot;The Daily's Double Shot&quot; in 2010. It is shown on UWTV, Channel 27, and is available to two million cable subscribers across the state of Washington.

The IMA (intramural activities) Center underwent a $41 million remodel and expansion project in 2001 and reopened in fall 2003. The original {{convert|40000|ft2|m2}} facility constructed in 1968 was upgraded and expanded with a {{convert|95000|ft2|m2}} addition to its northwest.

===Athletics===
{{Main|Washington Huskies}}
[[File:Washington Huskies defense.jpg|thumb|upright|Washington Huskies football team]]
UW students, sports teams, and alumni are called [[Washington Huskies]], and often referred to [[Metonymy|metonymically]] as &quot;Montlake,&quot; due to the campus's location on Montlake Boulevard N.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/thiel/300600_thiel22.html |title=Mora's move generates intrigue |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It should be noted that the traditional bounds of the [[Montlake, Seattle, Washington|Montlake neighborhood]] do ''not'' extend north of the [[Montlake Cut]] to include the campus.) The [[husky]] was selected as the school mascot by student committee in 1922. It replaced the &quot;Sun Dodger,&quot; an abstract reference to the [[Seattle, Washington#Climate|local weather]] that was quickly dropped in favor of something more tangible. The costumed &quot;Harry the Husky&quot; performs at sporting and special events, and a live [[Alaskan Malamute]], currently named Dubs, has traditionally led the UW [[American football|football]] team onto the field at the start of games. The school colors of [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]] were adopted in 1892 by student vote. The choice was purportedly inspired by the first [[stanza]] of [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[The Destruction of Sennacherib]]'':

::''The [[Assyria]]n came down like the wolf on the fold,''
::''And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;''
::''And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,''
::''When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep [[Sea of Galilee|Galilee]].''

The sports teams participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s Division I-A and in the [[Pacific-12 Conference]]. Among its facilities on campus are [[Husky Stadium]] (football and track &amp; field), the [[Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion]] (basketball, volleyball, and gymnastics), [[Husky Ballpark]] (baseball), Husky Softball Stadium, The [[William Quillian (athlete)|Bill Quillian Tennis Stadium]], The [[Nordstrom]] Tennis Center, Dempsey Indoor (Indoor track &amp; field, football) and the Conibear Shellhouse (rowing). The [[golf]] team plays at the Washington National Golf Club and the [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] team calls the [[Weyerhaeuser]] Aquatic Center and the Husky pool home.

The [[Washington Huskies football|University football team]] is traditionally competitive, having won a share of the 1991 national title with the [[University of Miami]], to go along with eight [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] victories and an [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] title. From 1907 to 1917, Washington football teams were unbeaten in 63 consecutive games, an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] record.&lt;ref name=unbeaten&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2006/2006_d1_football_records_book.pdf | title=Official 2006 NCAA Divisions I-A and I-AA Football Record Book | publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] | page = 110 | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-12-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071201045746/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2006/2006_d1_football_records_book.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tailgate party|Tailgating]] by boat has been a Husky Stadium tradition since 1920 when the stadium was first built on the shores of [[Lake Washington]]. The [[Apple Cup]] game is an annual game against cross-state rival [[Washington State University]] that was first contested in 1900 with UW leading the all-time series, 65 wins to 31 losses and 6 ties. [[Steve Sarkisian]] is the current head football coach.

[[File:Hec Ed.JPG|thumb|left|[[Alaska Airlines Arena at Hec Edmundson Pavilion|Hec Edmundson Pavilion]] is used for basketball and volleyball.]]

The men's [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|basketball]] team has been moderately successful, though recently the team has enjoyed a resurgence under coach [[Lorenzo Romar]]. With Romar as head coach, the team has been to six [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournaments]] (2003â2004, 2004â2005, 2005â2006, 2008â2009, 2009â2010 and 2010-2011 seasons), 2 consecutive top 16 (sweet sixteen) appearances, and secured a #1 seed in 2005. On December 23, 2005, the men's basketball team won their 800th victory in Hec Edmundson Pavilion, the most wins for any NCAA team in its current arena.

[[College rowing (United States)|Rowing]] is a longstanding tradition at the University of Washington dating back to 1901. The Washington men's crew gained international prominence by winning the [[gold medal]] at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], defeating the [[Germany|German]] and [[Italy|Italian]] crews much to the chagrin of [[Adolf Hitler]] who was in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/sports/cent21.shtml Events of the Century], ''Seattle PI'', December 21, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the men's crew furthered their lore with a shocking win over [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] [[Trud]]'s world champion rowers in [[Moscow]], resulting in the first [[United States|American]] sporting victory on [[Soviet]] soil, and certainly the first time a [[Russia]]n crowd gave any American team a standing ovation during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/magazine/features/si50/states/washington/water_world/ Water World], ''Sports Illustrated'', November 17, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The men's crew have won 15 national titles (14 [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], 1 [[National Collegiate Rowing Championship]]), 15 Olympic gold medals, two silver and five bronze. The women have 10 national titles and two Olympic gold medals. The Husky men are the 2011 national champions.

Recent national champions include the [[Washington Huskies softball|softball]] team ([[2009 Women's College World Series|2009]]), the men's rowing team (2011, 2009, 2007), NCAA Division I women's [[Cross country running|cross country]] team (2008), and the women's [[volleyball]] team ([[2005 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2005]]). Individually, Scott Roth was the 2011 NCAA men's Outdoor [[Pole Vault]] and 2011 &amp; 2010 NCAA men's Indoor Pole Vault champion. [[James Lepp]] was the 2005 NCAA men's [[golf]] champion. Ryan Brown (men's 800 meters) and Amy Lia (women's 1500 meters) won individual titles at the 2006 NCAA [[Track and field|Track &amp; Field]] Championships. [[Brad Walker (athlete)|Brad Walker]] was the 2005 NCAA men's Outdoor and Indoor Pole Vault champion.

Husky Stadium is one of several places that may have been the birthplace of the crowd phenomenon known as &quot;[[Audience wave|The Wave]]&quot;. It is claimed that the wave was invented in October 1981 by Husky graduate Robb Weller and UW band director Bill Bissel. Their opponent that night was Stanford.

On May 1, 2009, the athletic department announced it was discontinuing both men's and women's swimming programs effective immediately due to budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gohuskies.com/sports/c-swim/spec-rel/050109aab.html |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Washington Huskies |accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Husky Stadium===
{{Main|Husky Stadium}}
[[Image:Aerial Husky Stadium March 2009.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Husky Stadium in 2009]]
The new Husky Stadium is the first and primary income source of a completely remodeled athletic district. This major remodel of the athletic village will take decades to complete, as it will take place at the same time as a massive project by the Washington State Department of Transportation on nearby highways and bridges. The stadium project consists of a new grand concourse, underground light-rail station, enclosed west end of the stadium, replacement of bleachers with individual seating, removal of track and Huskytron, new press box, private box seating, lowering of the field, football offices, permanent seating in the east end zone that does not block the view of Lake Washington, and new and improved amenities, concession stands and bathrooms throughout. In addition, the concession areas will be constructed to face inward, allowing spectators to view the game through the main concourse which will circle around the field. Along with the Husky Stadium remodel, new parking garages will be constructed and renovated facilities throughout the athletic village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=uwfacilities01&amp;date=20061201|title=UW athletic director unveils new Husky Stadium drawings

The stadium has developed numerous structural problems, particularly in the lower bowl, caused by age and the continually moist weather. Renovation plans are slated to begin in November of 2011. The project was approved by University of Washington regents in November of 2010 at a cost of $250 million.

Several drawings by [[Populous (architects)|Populous]] (formerly HOK Sport) have been released depicting what the future Husky Stadium might look like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2003456124_uwfacilities01.html |title=UW athletic director unveils new Husky Stadium drawings |author=Bob Condotta |date=December 1, 2006 |work= |publisher=The Seattle Times |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Picture |author= |newspaper=The Seattle Times |date= |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/2006/11/30/2003455695.jpg |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student housing===
New building construction and renovations are scheduled to take place through 2020. The plan includes the construction of three six-story residence halls and two apartment complexes in the west section of campus, near the existing [[Terry and Lander Halls]], in Phase I, the renovation of six existing residence halls in Phase II, and additional new construction in Phase III. The projects will result in a net gain of approximately 2,400 beds.

In addition to on-campus housing the undergraduate student government, Associated Students of the University Washington, provides a free service to students, faculty, and staff looking to live off-campus called Off-Campus Housing Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Off-Campus Housing Affairs, ASUW; http://housing.asuw.org&lt;/ref&gt; They provide a free online search engine to local housing and resources to assist first time renters.

===Student organizations===
Many of the sustainable changes at the University of Washington have resulted from campus activism. Several environmental-activism groups on campus include:

*Students Expressing Environmental Dedication (SEED): SEED works with Housing and Food Services to increase the sustainability of the residence halls and dining areas.
*UW Earth Club: The Earth Club is interested in promoting the expression of environmental attitudes and consciousness through specialized events.
*UW Farm: The UW farm grows crops on campus and advocates urban farming in the UW community.
*Washington Public Interest Research Group (WashPIRG): WashPIRG engages students in a variety of activism causes, including environmental projects on campus and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/poeweb/news/susuw.html#students |title=Student Organizations  |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UW Sierra Student Coalition: SSC is dedicated to many larger environmental issues on campus and providing related opportunities to students.
*UW Delta Delta Sigma Pre-Dental Society (DDS): This is a club dedicated to serving pre-dental students and it provides a forum for discussion of dental related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://students.washington.edu/dental/ |title=DDS |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song===
The University of Washington Husky [[Marching Band]] performs at many Husky sporting events including all [[American football|football]] games. The band was founded in 1929, and today it is a cornerstone of Husky spirit. The band marches using a traditional high step, and it is one of only a few marching bands left in the United States to do so. Like many college bands, the Husky band has several traditional songs that it has played for decades, including the official [[fight song]] &quot;[[Bow Down to Washington]]&quot; and &quot;[[Tequila (song)|Tequila]]&quot;, as well as fan-favorite &quot;[[Africano]]&quot;. In addition to athletic events, the band also plays at various other events such as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]].

The University of Washington's mascot is [[Harry the Husky]]. The University of Washington has hosted a long line of [[Alaskan Malamute]]s as mascots.  The 13 dogs thus far have been:
*Frosty I (1922â29)
*Frosty II (1930â36)
*Wasky (1946)
*Wasky II (1947â53)
*Ski (1954â57)
*Denali (1958)
*King Chinook (1959â68)
*Regent Denali (1969â80)
*Sundodger (1981â91)
*King Redoubt (1992â97)
*Prince Redoubt (1998)
*Spirit (1999â2008)
*Dubs (2009â)

Originally the dogs were cared for by the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity, followed by a 49 year tradition (1959â2008) of care by the Cross family (a UW professor followed by his son).

==Sustainability==
Then UW President Emmert signed the American College &amp; University Presidents Climate Commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentsclimatecommitment.org/html/signatories.php |title=Whoâs Who |author= |date= |work= American College &amp; University |publisher=Presidentsclimatecommitment.org |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help follow through on this promise, the UW has created a Climate Action Team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwnews.org/uweek/article.aspx?id=46996 |title=UW seeks to deepen its commitment to sustainability |author=Robert Roseth |date=February 5, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also created an Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee (ESAC), which recently created an inventory of UW's greenhouse gas emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/about/environmentalstewardship/UW_GHG_inventory_2005.pdf |title=About the Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee (ESAC) |author= |date=August 10, 2004 |work= |publisher=Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; an environmental stewardship coordinator position, and has formalized a policy on environmental stewardship to give full institutional support to the cause of campus sustainability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Environmental Stewardship&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Environmental Stewardship Advisory Committee| publisher=University of Washington | url =http://www.washington.edu/about/environmentalstewardship/ | accessdate = 2008-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2006, the UW joined a partnership with Seattle City Light as part of their Green Up Program. All of Seattle campus' electricity is purchased from renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattle.gov/news/detail.asp?ID=5867&amp;Dept=40 |title=? |author= |date=2/2006 |work= |publisher=City of Seattle Press Release |accessdate= }}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housing and Food Services (HFS) spends several million dollars annually on locally produced, organic, and natural foods. HFS does not use styrofoam containers for any of its facilities on campus, instead using compostable cups, plates, utensils, and packaging whenever possible. Students Expressing Environmental Concern (SEED) is funded by HFS and is responsible for most of the sustainable changes made to HFS. Several new residence halls are planned for 2020, all of which are expected to meet silver or gold LEED standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hfs.washington.edu/about_hfs/default.aspx?id=2228 |title=Housing and Food Services: Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability |author= |date= |work= |publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All new state-funded buildings and major renovations must meet a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] standard of at least Silver.&lt;ref name=&quot;uwnews.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleID=43903 |title=UW again receives grade of A- for sustainability |author= |date=September 26, 2008 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Washington was one of only six universities to receive the highest grade on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, an &quot;A-&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =College Sustainability Report Card 2008 | publisher =Sustainable Endowments Institute| url =http://www.endowmentinstitute.org/ | accessdate = 2008-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report card identified the UW as one of 15 Overall College Sustainability Leaders among the 300 institutions surveyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;uwnews.org&quot;/&gt;
