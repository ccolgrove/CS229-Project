==History==

DMC-CFI, then named Dipolog Medical Center School of Midwifery, began as an expansion program of Dipolog Medical Center Inc., a stock corporation which started operating on August 1, 1974 as a fifty-bed general hospital located in Sta. Filomena, Dipolog City. Dipolog Medical Center (DMC) is the realization of the ideas of fifteen Dipolog medical practitioners and Msgr. Felix Zafra, former bishop of Dipolog, pooling their expertise and resources together to establish a high-quality hospital facility in the city. It took more than two years for the institution to open a course of Midwifery, which began operating in 1977.

In 1989, after a series of financial setbacks, a new management team took over the helm of DMC within a year. The new management felt the need for exposing more young men and women of the cities of Dipolog and Dapitan and the neighboring municipalities to medical training and the medical profession. Through the efforts of Chairman of the Board Atty. Alberto P. Concha and Hospital Director Dr. Stephen Yap, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) curriculum was opened. The permit by the Bureau of Higher Education was granted on April 30, 1991, and the school began its first year level of BSN June of that year.

In the same year, the name of the school was changed to Dipolog Medical Center College of Health Sciences. DMCCHS became a grantee of the Johns Hopkins International Education for Reproductive Health Foundation which, in collaboration with the Association of Deans of Philippine Colleges of Nursing (ADPCN), bestowed DMCCHS an extension of its hospital facility, the JHPIEGO Center.

In its continuing aim for excellence and growth, the management initiated the application to the Department of Education for permits to open other programs in the health sciences. In 1994, the Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy (BSPT) began its first year level, and in 1996, the Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology (BSMT) and the Bachelor of Science in Radiologic Technology (BSRT) also opened for enrolment.

In 1998, the Dipolog Medical Center College of Health Sciences was once again renamed the Dipolog Medical Center College Foundation, Inc. in recognition of its conversion into a non-profit organization. In the same year, it opened its Masters program and started conferring the degree in Master in Public Administration. Two more bachelor degree programs were also opened that same year, the Bachelor of Science in Criminology and Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

In 2000, the DMC Science High School was opened. New programs were also initiated: Bachelor of Science in Commerce, Bachelor of Secondary Education, Bachelor of Elementary Education, Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, and Bachelor of Civil Engineering were opened.

In 2003, in consortium with Negros Oriental State University (NORSU), the school launched the programs Doctorate in Management, Doctorate in Education, and Master of Arts in Educational Management courses.

DMC Science High School signed a consultancy agreement with the LaSallian Schools Supervision Office (LASSO) in 2005, placing the DMC-SHS under Consultancy Status for a period of one year. While under Consultancy Status, the school was extended LASSOâs assistance in curricula, training, and organizational structure.

In November of 2005, DMCCFI began its placement and staffing agency â the Staff Builders LLC, a United States-based Limited Liability Corporation, the purpose of which is to assist nurse and physical therapist alumni of DMCCFI who are seeking employment in the United States.

In December 15, 2008, the permits for the first and second levels for Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management were issued by the Commission on Higher Education. This was followed by the issuance of the permit for the third level on February 3, 2010 of BS HRM.

The school year 2010-2011 marks the opening of the College of Law after the CHED issued its permit last March 29, 2010. It is headed by [[Dean Alberto Villarruz College | Dean Villarruz]], a lawyer who graduated from the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. The college vouches for a good line of faculty members, most of whom graduated from prestigious schools like the [[University of the Philippines]], [[De La Salle | De La Salle Schools]] and [[Notre Dame Educational Association | Notre Dame Schools]].

Presently, the college has been granted Applicant Status by PAASCU. Likewise, the college is also pursuing its status for the Institutional Monitoring and Evaluation for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (IQuaME).
