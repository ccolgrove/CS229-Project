'''Seton Hall University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[university]] in [[South Orange, New Jersey]], [[United States]]. Founded in 1856 by Archbishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]], Seton Hall is the oldest diocesan university in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ssrn.com/update/ern/ernjob/job272.html|title= Seton Hall University History |work= Social Science Research Network |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seton Hall is also the oldest and largest Catholic university in the [[State of New Jersey]]. The university is known for its programs in [[business]], [[law]], [[education]], [[nursing]], and [[diplomacy]].

Seton Hall is made up of eight different schools and colleges with an undergraduate enrollment of about 5,200 students and a graduate enrollment of about 4,400. Its [[Seton Hall University School of Law|School of Law]], which is ranked by ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'' as one of the [[Law school rankings#Rankings by U.S. News and World Report|top]] 100 law schools in the nation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Graduate School Rankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.shu.edu/administration/public_relations/press_releases/2006/usnews_rankings_06.htm|title= Graduate School Rankings |work= US News and World Report |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-04-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060916145804/http://law.shu.edu/administration/public_relations/press_releases/2006/usnews_rankings_06.htm |archivedate = September 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an enrollment of about 1,200 students. Seton Hall's [[Stillman School of Business]] has also been continually ranked as one of the top 100 undergraduate business schools in the nation according to [[BusinessWeek]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/bs_ugrank_tab_0303.html?chan=bschools_special+report+--+best+college+business+programs_special+report+--+best+college+business+programs&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry was the first school of medicine in the State of New Jersey. The school was acquired by the state in 1965, and is now the [[New Jersey Medical School]], part of the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]].

== History ==
===Early history===
[[Image:Bayley 1876.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Founder Bishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]]]] 
Like many Catholic universities in the United States, Seton Hall arose out of the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore|Plenary Council of American Bishops]], held in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1844, with the goal of bringing Catholicism to higher education in order to help propagate the faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rcan.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=feature.display&amp;feature_ID=105|title= Higher Education Seeks to Instill Knowledge and Faith|work= Archdiocese of Newark Website |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Archdiocese of Newark|Diocese of Newark]] had been established by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1853, just three years before the founding of the college, and it necessitated an institution for higher learning.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; Seton Hall College was formally founded on September 1, 1856 by Archdiocese of Newark Bishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]], a cousin of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Bishop Bayley named the institution after his aunt, Mother [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]], who was later named the first American-born Catholic [[saint]]. 

The main campus of the college was originally in [[Madison, New Jersey]]. Reverend [[Bernard John McQuaid|Bernard J. McQuaid]] served as the first college president (1856â1857, 1859â1868) and directed a staff of four diocesan clergy including Reverend Alfred Young, vice-president; Reverend Daniel Fisher (the second college president, 1857â1859) and five lay instructors. Initially, Seton Hall had only five students â [[Leo G. Thebaud]], Louis and Alfred Boisaubin, Peter Meehan and John Moore. By the end of the first year, the student body had grown more than tenfold to 60. The college moved to its current location in 1860.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Seton hall dorm.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Postcard showing Stafford Hall, one of the first dormitories, in the late 19th century]]

By the 1860s, Seton Hall College was continuing its rapid growth and began to enroll more and more students each year. However, among other difficulties, several fires on campus slowed down the growth process. The first of several strange fires in the University's history occurred in 1867 which destroyed the collegeâs first building. Two decades later on March 9, 1886, another fire destroyed the universityâs main building.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= |title= History of Seton Hall |first= Alan, et al |last= Delozier |work= Walsh Library Archives| accessdate= 2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, another campus fire burned down a classroom as well as several dormitory buildings in 1909.

During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight times and the [[American Civil War]], the College continued to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) during the summer of 1893, but this program was ultimately disbanded during the [[Spanish-American War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;/&gt; Perhaps one of the most pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when [[Seton Hall Preparatory School|Seton Hallâs preparatory]] (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated.&lt;ref name=&quot;history2&quot;/&gt; By 1937, Seton Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall. Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, Seton Hall was given a license by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] for [[WSOU-FM]]. Today, the station is considered by some as one of the leading college radio stations in the country.[[File:Presidents Hall of Seton Hall University.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President's Hall, one of the university's oldest buildings]]

The College was organized into a university in 1950 following an unprecedented growth in enrollment. The College of Arts and Sciences and the schools of business, nursing and education comprised the University; the School of Law opened its doors in 1951, with Miriam Rooney as the first woman dean of law in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

=== College of Medicine and Dentistry ===
The '''Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry ''' was established in 1954 as the first medical school and dental school in New Jersey.  It was located in [[Jersey City]], adjacent to the [[Jersey City Medical Center]], which was used for clinical education. Although the College, set up under the auspices of the [[Archdiocese of Newark]], was a separate legal entity from the University, it had an interlocking Board of Trustees. The first class was enrolled in 1956 and graduated in 1960. The dental school also awarded its first degrees in 1960. From 1960 to 1964, 348 individuals received an M.D. degree. The College was sold to the state of New Jersey in 1965 for US$4&amp;nbsp;million after the Archdiocese could not support mounting school debt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umdnj.edu/librweb/speccoll/SHCMD.html |title= Record Group RG/A Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry 1946â1965 |work= SHU |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (now the [[New Jersey Medical School]], part of the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umdnj.edu/about/about03_history.htm |title=bout UMDNJ: History and Timeline |work= UMDNJ |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2008-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modernization period===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:P4100200-m.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton{{puic|Image:P4100200-m.jpg|log=2008 February 14}}]] --&gt;
Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing in the next two decades, the university saw the construction and modernization of a large number of facilities and the construction of the library, science building, residence halls and the University center. Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The 1970s and 1980s continued to be a time of growth and renewal. New business and nursing classroom buildings and an art center were opened. In 1984, the Immaculate Conception Seminary returned to Seton Hall, its original home until 1926, when it moved to Darlington (a section of [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]] centered around a grand mansion and estate). The Recreation Center was dedicated in 1987. With the construction of four new residence halls between 1986 to 1988, and the purchase of an off-campus apartment building in 1990, the University made significant changes to account for a larger number of student residents. Seton Hall is recognized as a residential campus, providing living space for about 2100 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://studentaffairs.shu.edu/housing/residencehalls.html|title=Housing Information|work= SHU Housing &amp; Residence Life|year= 2007 |accessdate= 2008-01-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223073747/http://studentaffairs.shu.edu/housing/residencehalls.html |archivedate = December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Walshlib1.jpg|thumb|left|240px|The Walsh Library in spring.]]

The physical development of the campus continued in the 1990s. The $20&amp;nbsp;million Walsh Library opened in 1994, and its first-class study and research resources marked the beginning of a technological transformation of Seton Hall. The University dedicated its newest academic center in 1997, originally named Kozlowski Hall for Dennis Kozlowski, former CEO of [[Tyco International]].  Renamed Jubilee Hall following Kozlowski's criminal conviction in 2005, the building is a clear example of Seton Hall's commitment to expanding the role of information technology in higher education. All classrooms in this six-story, 126,000&amp;nbsp;square foot (12,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) building are wired for network and Internet connections, and many of the lecture halls are equipped with distance-learning technology. Its recreation center was originally named after Robert Brennan, but he was found guilty of securities fraud in 1994. It has since been renamed for long-time athletic director [[Richie Regan]]. 

A new School of Law building and parking garage were also constructed in the 1990s as part of the revitalization of downtown Newark. Seton Hall continues to be a leader in technology in education, as well as in distance learning, with its renowned Seton World Wide program. In 1998, all incoming full-time, first-year students were issued laptop computers as part of the University's innovative and nationally recognized mobile computing program.

=== Boland Hall fire ===
{{main|Boland Hall Fire}}
On January 19, 2000, an arson fire killed three and injured 54 students in Boland Hall, a freshman [[dormitory]] on the campus in [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/01/19/seton.hall.fire.03/|title= Three Die in Dorm Fire at Seton Hall |work= CNN News |year= 2000 |accessdate= 2007-05-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070302204034/http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/01/19/seton.hall.fire.03/ |archivedate = March 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident, one of the deadliest in recent US history, occurred at 4:30am, when most students were asleep. After a three-and-a-half year investigation, a 60-count [[indictment]] charged two freshmen students, Sean Ryan and Joseph LePore, with starting the fire and [[Felony murder rule|felony murder]] for the deaths that resulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/11/15/student.arson/index.html |title= Former students reach plea deal in killer dorm fire |work= CNN News |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-04-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070325105803/http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/11/15/student.arson/index.html |archivedate = March 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LePore and Ryan pled guilty to third-degree [[arson]] and were sentenced to five years in a youth correctional facility with eligibility for parole 16&amp;nbsp;months after the start of their prison terms.

===Sesquicentennial and onwards===
[[Image:SHUchapel.jpg|thumb|right|Immaculate Conception Chapel, built during the [[American Civil War]]]] Seton Hall alumni and community, on the 150th anniversary (1856â2006) of the universityâs founding, initiated the Ever Forward capital campaign to raise a total of $150&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everforward.shu.edu/about/index.htm
|title= Ever Forward Campaign Description |work= Division of University Advancement |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-04-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070304001801/http://everforward.shu.edu/about/index.htm |archivedate = March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign is one of the most prestigious building campaigns in the Universityâs long history. The funds will go to many areas throughout the university, however, a majority will go to building and reconstructing campus facilities and historic sites. 

Among the most notable objectives of the campaign, there will be a new site and complex for the Universityâs [[John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations|Whitehead School of Diplomacy]]. The University Center is also being planned to be rebuilt in a [[neo-gothic]] style to match other university buildings. Most recently, the rebuilding of the Universityâs Science and Technology Center began in 2005 and was scheduled to be unveiled just prior to the start of the 2007â2008 academic year.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Chapelfront.jpg|thumb|right|Immaculate Conception Chapel shown here after undergoing renovations]] --&gt;
In fall 2007, the university opened the new $35&amp;nbsp;million Science and Technology Center, completing one of the major campaign priorities ahead of schedule. On December 17, 2007, the university announced that the campaign's fund raising goals had been met and exceeded more than two weeks ahead of the campaign's scheduled closing date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shu.edu/events/ever-forward.cfm?cm_sp=University%20Advancement-_-Ever%20Forward%20Completion-_-Without%20Photos Ever Forward Campaign completion page]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2009 University President Monsignor Robert Sheeran announced he will be stepping down in June 2010. The Board of Regents plans to establish a search committee over the summer, with the intent of finding and announcing Sheeranâs successor by July 2010.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheeran to Step Down as Seton Hallâs President&quot;&gt;[http://www.shu.edu/offices/president/sheeran-steps-down.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the summer of 2010, the university drew criticism from the Archbishop of Newark, John J. Myers, after it was announced that a course called &quot;The Politics of Gay Marriage&quot; would be offered.  Catholic students also voiced their opposition, pointing to a conflict between the university's Catholic identity and what appeared to be the promotion of homosexuality in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfpstudentaction.org/get-involved/online-petitions/seton-hall-university-betrays-identity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
The university, legally incorporated as âSeton Hall University, an educational corporation of New Jersey,â is governed by a 16-member Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shu.edu/offices/president/upload/University-By-Laws.pdf|format=PDF|title=University By-Laws|work= Office of Board Affairs |year= 2006 |accessdate= 2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eleven members of the board serve on it as a virtue of their positions within the University or [[Archdiocese of Newark]]. The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark|Archbishop of Newark]], who serves as the President of the Board, retains the power to appoint the remaining five members of the body. Appointed members of the board serve three-year terms, until their respective successor is appointed. The Board of Trustees exclusively maintains the property rights of the university and provides selection of title, scope, and location of the schools and colleges of the university.

The governance of the university includes a Board of Regents, which is charged with the management of the university. The Board has a membership of between 25 and 39 members. Six of the members are ex-officio; the Board of Trustees maintains the right to elect up to thirty more. Regents maintain the exclusive hiring authority over the President of the university, who, by virtue of the by-laws of the university, must always be a [[Roman Catholic priest]] and who is explicitly named the [[chief executive officer]] of the organization.

In May 2009, current president Monsignor Robert Sheeran announced that he will step down in June 2010. The university has engaged in a year-long [http://www.shu.edu/presidentialsearch/index.cfm presidential search] to name his successor by July 1, 2010. University Regent Joseph P. LaSala is the chair of the Presidential Search and Screen Committee.

In January 2010 the search committee named the Interim President and former Provost, Dr. Amado Gabriel Esteban as the 20th President of Seton Hall University. An alumnus of the [[University of the Philippines]], Esteban is Seton Hall's first lay president, and is the first Filipino to become president of an American university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/03/16/11/alumnus-first-pinoy-president-us-university|title=UP alumnus is first Pinoy president of US university|publisher=ABS-CBN News|accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
===Main campus===
[[Image:Shucollegemap.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A map from 1885 showing the Seton Hall College campus within the [[South Orange]] Village lines]] The main campus of Seton Hall University is situated on 58&amp;nbsp;acres (23&amp;nbsp;ha) of suburban land on South Orange Avenue. It is home to seven of the eight schools and colleges of the University. The [[South Orange|South Orange Village]] center is just Â½&amp;nbsp;mile (0.8&amp;nbsp;km) south of the main campus. Directly across from the main campus to the west are scenic Montrose Park and the [[Montrose Park Historic District]], which is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; The [[Eugene V. Kelly Carriage House]], on the campus itself, is also NRHP-listed.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;&gt;{{NRISref|version=2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village itself dates back to 1666 preceding the establishment of Seton Hall College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.southorange.org/history.asp |title= The South Orange Village History|work= South Orange Village Website| accessdate= 2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Since the beginning of the College, the [[South Orange (NJT station)|South Orange Rail Station]] has served as an integral means to campus commuters. The main campus combines architectural styles including [[Roman architecture|Roman]], [[neo-gothic]] and [[modern]]. The South Orange campus became a gated community during the Universityâs Modernization Period.

===Newark Campus===
[[File:One Newark Center fr Cherry St jeh.jpg|thumb|right|Seton Hall Law complex in Newark, NJ]] 
A satellite of the main campus, the Newark Campus is home to the Universityâs [[Seton Hall University School of Law|School of Law]]. Located at [[One Newark Center]], the Law School and several academic centers of the University are housed in a modern 22-story [[skyscraper]] building. It is at the corner of Raymond Boulevard and McCarter Highway in the business and high-tech heart of downtown [[Newark, New Jersey]] and was completed in 1991. The Newark Campus building provides {{convert|210000|sqft|m2}} and an additional {{convert|65000|sqft|m2}} of library to the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=1newarkcenter-newark-nj-usa|title= One Newark Center |work= Emporis Worldwide Listing |year= 2006 |accessdate= 2008-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Seton Hall University School of Law was founded in 1951. It is accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) since 1951 and is also a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] (AALS). Seton Hall is one of three law schools in the state of New Jersey. &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Onenewarkcenter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Seton Hall School of Law in Newark, NJ{{puic|Image:Onenewarkcenter.jpg|log=2008 February 14}}]] --&gt;

===Buildings===
The original centerpieces of the campus were made up of three buildings built in the 19th century. The Presidentâs, Stafford and Marshall Hall were built when the College moved from [[Madison, New Jersey]] to [[South Orange]]. Some of the more notable buildings on campus are: 

* '''President's Hall''' â One of the oldest buildings on campus and a flagship of the University, Presidentâs Hall was completed in 1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sohps.org/seton_hall_history%20walking_tour.htm| title = University Day Historical Walking Tour of Seton Hall University Facts| publisher = South Orange Historical and Preservation Society | accessdate = 2008-01-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080526031618/http://www.sohps.org/seton_hall_history+walking_tour.htm |archivedate = May 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at the epicenter of the main campus, Presidentâs Hall is a [[neo-gothic]] structure dressed in [[brownstone]]. It originally served as a seminary but now houses the Universityâs administration including the Office of the University President. The halls are lined with portraits of past University presidents and include a large [[stained glass]] depicting [[Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton]], which was commissioned in 1866 by President Bayley.
* '''McQuaid Hall''' â Built around 1900, it was named for Bishop Bernard J. McQuaid, Seton Hallâs first President from 1856â1857 and 1859â1867.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;/&gt; McQuaid Hall was both a boarding house for students and a convent for nuns before serving its present purpose as the home of the [[John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations]] as well as the Graduate School of Medical Education.
[[Image:Jubilee Hall - Seton Hall.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Jubilee Hall on the South Orange, NJ campus of Seton Hall University, is the home of the Stillman School of Business.]]
* '''Jubilee Hall''' houses the [[W. Paul Stillman School of Business]] in addition to the largest [[auditorium]] at the University. There are several computer labs, state-of-the-art classrooms and a Stock Exchange research room. The building was originally named Kozlowski Hall after [[Dennis Kozlowski]], Seton Hall Alumni and former CEO of Tyco International. Following Kozlowski's conviction for securities fraud the building was renamed at his request to Jubilee Hall in honor of the [[Jubilee (Christian)|Papal Jubilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE5DD103EF93AA2575BC0A9639C8B63&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fS%2fSeton%20Hall%20University|title= New Jersey: South Orange: Convict's Name Off Building |work= New York Times |year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Built in 1997, it is one of the newer additions to the main campus.
* '''[[Walsh Gymnasium]]''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] for University Sports. The arena opened in 1939 and can seat 2,600 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;/&gt; It was home to the Seton Hall University Pirates men's [[basketball]] team before they moved to [[Continental Airlines Arena]] and then the [[Prudential Center]]. Currently, the arena hosts the women's [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] teams, and is part of the Richie Regan Recreation and Athletic Center. The building, like the school's main library, is named for Thomas J. Walsh, Fifth Bishop of Newark and former President of the Board of Trustees.
[[Image:Shu mcnulty night.jpg|thumb|right|250px|McNulty Hall at night]]
* '''McNulty Hall''' â Named for Msgr. John L. McNulty, President of the University from 1949â1959, McNulty Hall was built as the universityâs technology and research center in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;/&gt; One of the most famous features of the building is the âAtom Wallâ a relief artwork originally located on outer faÃ§ade. Following renovations completed in the summer of 2007, the Atom Wall, depicting the gift of scientific knowledge from God to man, can be seen in the glass atrium of the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;/&gt; McNulty also houses a large amphitheater and observatory for the [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[biology]] departments.
* '''Fahy Hall''' â Built in 1968, the building houses the classrooms and faculty offices of the College of Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;/&gt; The building was named after [[Monsignor Thomas George Fahy]] who served as President of the University from 1970â1976. Fahy Hall includes several student resources and facilities, including two television studios, two amphitheaters and [[laboratories]] for computing, language learning, and statistics.
* '''Arts and Sciences Hall''' â Originally built to house the Stillman School of Business in 1973, with the creation of Jubilee Hall in 1997, the building is now home to the College of Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;buildings&quot;/&gt; The building is conjoined with the College of Nursing in the north wing. The College of Nursing has advanced teaching facilities including hospital beds, demonstration rooms and multi-purpose practice areas.

===Sustainability===
Seton Hall's extensive recycling program is one of the highlights in the college's sustainability programming. Recycling is mandatory on campus as per New Jersey state laws.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shu.edu/offices/policies-procedures/facilities-engineering-recycling.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Seton Hall celebrated Earth Day 2010, marking the event with demonstrations about composting and rainwater collection, a group hike, and an outdoor screening of the environmental documentary &quot;HOME.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://gogreen.shu.edu/blog/&lt;/ref&gt;

On the College Sustainability Report Card 2011, Seton Hall earned a grade of &quot;B-&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenreportcard.org&quot;/&gt; Lack of endowment transparency and green building initiatives hurt the grade, while the recycling programs were a plus.

== Academics ==
Seton Hall University confers [[undergraduate]], [[Graduate school|graduate]], and [[postgraduate]] degrees in over 70 academic fields. The school's academic programs are divided into nine academic units:

== Traditions ==
===University seal===
The University seal as it is today is symbolic of hundreds of years of history. The seal combines attributes from the Bayley [[Coat of Arms]] and the [[Seton (surname)|Seton]] family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as 1216 and symbolizes [[History of Scotland|Scottish nobility]]. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest, which is notable for its three [[crescent]]s and three [[torteau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://pirate.shu.edu/~wisterro/Medallion/index.htm |title= Saints, Monsters, Bishops and Seton Hall |first= Msgr. Robert |last= Wister |work= mimeo| accessdate= 2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; The motto on the seal ''Hazard Zet Forward'' (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of [[Norman French]] and archaic English meaning ''at whatever risk, yet go forward''. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal in the middle of the university green. It is said that students who step on the seal will not graduate.

===Alma Mater===
The ''Seton Hall University Alma Mater'' was adopted as the official song of Seton Hall University. Charles A. Byrne of the class of 1937 wrote the original lyrics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Alma Mater lyrics|work= 2007 Commencement Exercises Pamphlet| accessdate= 2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1936 and the university adopted the alma mater during the 1937 school year when the dean first read it to the student body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://events.shu.edu/150/history.html |title= 150 year history of Seton Hall|year= 2007 |accessdate= 2008-02-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071126094606/http://events.shu.edu/150/history.html |archivedate = November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students participate in the tradition of saying &quot;blue and white&quot; more loudly than the rest of the alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.myspace.com/thesetonhallpirate|title= The Seton Hall Pirate's Myspace|year= 2007 |accessdate= 2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fight song===
&quot;Onward Setonia&quot; is Seton Hall's fight song and it is played by the University Pep Band at all home Men's and Women's basketball games, usually as the team comes onto the court and at the end of the first half and at the end of the game. The lyrics are as follows:
&quot;Onward Setonia, 
We are bound for victory.
Hazard Zet Forward,
We will honor that decree.
Onward Setonia, 
Stand up proud and stand up tall. 
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! 
For the Blue and White, 
and the glory of Seton Hall.&quot;
