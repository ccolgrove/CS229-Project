'''Crivitz''' is a village in [[Marinette County, Wisconsin|Marinette County]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]]. The population was 998 at the 2000 census. It is part of the [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]], WI&amp;ndash;[[Michigan|MI]] [[Marinette micropolitan area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
Crivitz was surveyed and plotted in the summer of 1883. This work was filed with the Register of Deeds in Marinette County on 10 September 1883 by German immigrant, Frederick John Bartels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villageofcrivitz.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Crivitz was a town until 1913, when it was incorporated as the Village of Crivitz. The village hall, originally located at 600 Main Avenue, was later relocated at 800 Main Avenue. The downtown developed along Main Avenue in the 600 to 900 blocks from 1913 to 1924. In 1924 a devastating fire destroyed 22 buildings along the south side of Main Avenue. In 1927, the village was disincorporated and became the Town of Crivitz. The fire, disincorporation, and the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 sealed the fate of Crivitz for many years. 

In 1974 Crivitz was once again incorporated as the Village of Crivitz, with the Village Hall at 800 Henriette Avenue. This was quickly followed by improvements in the water-sewer system, electrical system, and highway-transportation system. The village currently operates under its 1974 incorporation with a Village President (executive), a Board of Trustees (legislative), and a Municipal Judge (judicial). Village operations are carried out by the Public Works Department, Water-Sewer Department, Police Department, Fire Department, and Parks Department. In the 1980s the village business district moved to [[U.S. Route 141|U.S. Highway 141]] on the eastern edge of the village. Along with the inclusion of Dyer Buisness Park, in 2005, which runs along Highway 141. There has been no addition development in the downtown area of the village.  The residential area has continued to expand both north and south between the railroad tracks and the [[Peshtigo River]].

==Street Names==
Main Avenue (railroad tracts to Peshtigo River) is the heart of the original business district. This street is also known as &quot;County Highway W&quot;. Fourteen of the streets in the village are named for members of the Bartels family.  One Block North of Main Avenue is Henriette Avenue, named for a daughter and also known as County Highway A.  On the west side of the railroad tracks is Louisa Street. This was named for Fredrik Bartels' wife. On the west side of the village at the Peshtigo River is F. J. Street. This was named for Fredrick John Bartels himself.

==Recreation==
Crivitz enjoys a small town atmosphere with a focus on the recreational opportunities in the area, including hunting, fishing, boating, camping, snowmobiling and competitive sports activities.
