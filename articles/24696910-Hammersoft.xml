In the live finale, [[Poreotics|Poreotix]] was declared the winner of Season 5 and received the $100,000 ([[United States dollar|USD]]) prize.

==Crews==
A dance crew became eligible to compete either through the live audition process or through submission of an audition video. In either case, each crew had to prepare and perform an original routine lasting one or two minutes. The audition judges selected several of the crews for callbacks, and presented them with another challenge; each dance crew was given music and told to choreograph another group routine, followed by a series of short individual freestyles. The following day, these crews performed their two routines in front of a small panel of judges. After another set of callbacks, the remaining crews performed their original audition routines in front of an ''ABDC'' &quot;celebrity panel&quot;. These judges would then decide whether the crew would move onto the Regional competition. So far, there are no midwest regionals.&lt;ref name=audition/&gt;

===Week 7: Hip Hop Nation Challenge and Last Chance Challenge===
*Aired on April 1, 2010

This week on ABDC the crews competed against each other in two challenges: the Hip Hop Nation Challenge and the Last Chance Challenge. For both challenges, the crews got to collaborate with producer [[Swizz Beatz]].

====Challenge #1: Hip Hop Nation Challenge====
The remaining 3 crews displayed mastery of hip hop styles from around the nation. One crew was given the boot halfway through the show. The crews received help from three guest ABDC alumni from past seasons. Each alumnus was assigned to one of the dance styles the crews will be responsible for.
