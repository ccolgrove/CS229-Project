'''''Cold War''''' is a [[video game]] developed by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] developer [[Mindware Studios]] and published by [[DreamCatcher Games]] ([[Linux Game Publishing]] for [[Linux]]). The game is similar to the ''[[Splinter Cell]]'' series of games in that it uses a stealth-action system of gameplay.  The game distinguishes itself by adding an invention system where the player can use seemingly useless objects to create tools and weapons. Also, the story of the game centers around a civilian reporter, so no extremely acrobatic moves are available to the player. Another aspect of the game is that the player can take many different approaches to winning the game. The game was released in North America for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox]] on September 27, 2005. The [[Linux]] version was released on August 4, 2006.

== Story==
[[Image:Matthew Carter from the game Cold War.png|200px|thumb|left|Matthew Carter]]
''Cold War'' takes place in [[1986]] and follows the story of a freelance journalist Matthew Carter who finds himself in the midst of an international conspiracy that aims to control the [[Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]] 

Twelve hours after arriving in [[Moscow]] in hopes of gathering material for a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning story he finds himself thrown into [[KGB]]'s political prison and framed for an attempted murder of the president. 

Using only recovered weapons and improvised gadgets, he must now evade or overcome elite Soviet forces and defeat the conspiracy before he is sent to a Siberian prison camp or killed.

== Reception ==
''Cold War'' received more positive reviews on Linux, with [[Phoronix]] stating the game is &quot;truly phenomenal&quot; and that its &quot;one of the best single-player shooters we have ever played on Linux.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=469&amp;num=1 Initial Impressions: Cold War] [[Phoronix]], May 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[LinuxGames]] awarded it 8 out of 10 penguins, commenting that the game was &quot;the most enjoyable Linux gaming experience of 2006 so far.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxgames.com/reviews/cold-war Cold War Review] [[LinuxGames]]&lt;/ref&gt; PC Burn &quot;heartily&quot; recommended the game's Linux version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060703024624/pcburn.com/game_review-Cold_War.php Cold War on Linux] PC Burn, June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
*Although the game refers to the U.S.S.R. leader as &quot;president&quot;, there was no such office in the Soviet Union in [[1986]]. The actual country leader held the dual title of the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].
