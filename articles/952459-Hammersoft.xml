'''Cimicidae''' (or sometimes '''bedbugs''') are small [[parasitic]] insects.

A number of health effects may occur due to bed bugs, including [[skin rashes]], psychological effects, and allergic symptoms. Diagnosis involves both finding bed bugs and the occurrence of compatible symptoms. Treatment is otherwise symptomatic.

In the [[developed world]], bed bugs were largely eradicated as pests in the early 1940s, but have increased in prevalence since about 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Kilpenen | first1 = O. |last2 = Vagn Jensen | first2 = K-M. |last3 = Kristensen | first3 = M. |title = Bed Bug Problems in Denmark, with a European Perspective |pages = 395â399 |url = http://www.icup.org.uk/reports/ICUP858.pdf |accessdate = 27 May 2010 }}{{Cite book |last1 = Robinson | first1 = WH | last2 = Bajomi | first2 = D.

The name &quot;bed bug&quot; is derived from the insect's preferred habitat of houses and especially beds or other areas where people sleep. Bed bugs, though not strictly nocturnal, are mainly active at night and are capable of feeding unnoticed on their [[Host (biology)|host]]s. They have however been known by a variety of names, including wall louse, mahogany flat, crimson rambler, heavy dragoon, chinche and redcoat.&lt;ref name=EncycEntomV1&gt;{{Cite book |last = Capinera | first =John L. |title = Encyclopedia of Entomology, Volume 1 (2nd ed.) |publisher = Springer | location = |date = 17 Sep 2008 |pages = 405â417 |isbn = 1402062427 }}

==Description==
===Physical===
Adult bed bugs are light brown to reddish-brown, flattened, oval shaped and have no hind wings but front wings are vestigial and reduced to pad-like structures. Bed bugs have segmented abdomens with microscopic hairs that give them a banded appearance. Adults grow to 4â5&amp;nbsp;mm in length and 1.5â3&amp;nbsp;mm wide. Newly hatched [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]] are translucent, lighter in colour and become browner as they [[ecdysis|moult]] and reach [[sexual maturity|maturity]]. Bed bugs may be mistaken for other insects such as [[booklice]] and [[carpet beetles]], or vice-versa.

Bed bugs use [[pheromones]] and [[kairomones]] to communicate regarding nesting locations, feeding and reproduction.

The life span of bed bugs varies by species and is also dependent on feeding.

Bed bugs can survive a wide range of temperatures and atmospheric compositions. Below {{convert|16.1|C|F}}, adults enter semi-hibernation and can survive longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augustineexterminators.com/galleryDetail.asp?gallery_id=26 |title=Augustine Exterminators |publisher=Augustine Exterminators |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bed bugs can survive for at least five days at {{convert|-10|C|F}} but will die
after 15 minutes of exposure to {{convert|-32|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;birc.org&quot;&gt;IPM Practitioner, XXIX(3/4), March/April 2007 http://www.birc.org/MarApril2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They show high [[desiccation tolerance]], surviving low humidity and a 35â40&amp;nbsp;Â°C range even with loss of one-third of body weight; earlier life stages are more susceptible to drying out than later ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Benoit | first1 = J.

A bed bug pierces the skin of its host with what is called a stylet fascicle. This is a unit composed of the maxillae and mandibles which have been modified into elongate shapes from a basic, ancestral style.  The right and left maxillary stylets are connected at their midline and a section at the centerline forms a large food canal and a smaller salivary canal.  The entire maxillary and mandibular bundle penetrates the skin.  The tips of the right and left maxillary stylets are not the same: the right is hook-like and curved, the left straight.  The right and left mandibular stylets extend along the outer sides of their respective maxillary stylets and do not reach anywhere near the tip of the fused maxillary stylets.  The stylets are retained in a groove in the labium and during feeding they are freed from the groove as the jointed labium is bent or folded out of the way: its tip never enters the wound.  The mandibular stylet tips have small teeth and through alternately moving these stylets back and forth, the insect cuts a path through tissue for the maxillary bundle to reach an appropriate sized blood vessel.  Feeding by sucking for about three to five minutes or more, the bug then withdraws the stylet bundle from the feeding position and retracts it back into the labial groove, folds the entire unit back under the head, and returns to its hiding place.&lt;ref name=mednewstoday&gt;{{cite web |title = What Are Bed Bugs?

===Life stages===
Bed bugs have six life stages (five immature and an adult stage).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/98426/E91435.pdf] p.136&lt;/ref&gt; They will shed their skins through a molting process ([[ecdysis]]) throughout multiple stages of their lives. The discarded outer shells look like clear, empty exoskeletons of the bugs themselves. Bed bugs must molt six times before becoming fertile adults.

===Cause===
Dwellings can become infested with bed bugs in a variety of ways, from:
*Bugs and eggs that &quot;hitchhiked in&quot; on pets,&lt;ref name=&quot;Waldvogel&quot;&gt;Waldvogel, M., C Apperson. 2006 &quot; Bed Bugs.&quot; http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/ent/notes/Urban/bedbugs.htm 21 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or on clothing and luggage
*Infested items (such as furniture or clothing) brought in
*Nearby dwellings or infested items, if there are easy routes (through duct work or false ceilings)
*Wild animals (such as bats or birds)&lt;ref name=&quot;UKY&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher = University of Kentucky College of Agriculture |title = BED BUGS |last1 = Potter | first1 = Michael F. |url = http://www.ca.uky.edu/entomology/entfacts/ef636.asp |accessdate = 27 June2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avianadvice.uark.edu&quot;&gt;Steelman, C.D. 2000.

*People visiting from a source of infestation; bed bugs, like roaches, are transferred by clothing, luggage, or a person's body.

===Detection===
[[File:Bedbug with eggs.jpg|thumb|An engorged female bed bug (''Cimex lectularius'') with eggs, discovered in the screw hole of a wooden bed frame]]
Bed bugs are elusive and usually nocturnal, which can make them hard to spot. They often lodge unnoticed in dark crevices, and eggs can be nestled in fabric seams. Aside from bite symptoms, signs include fecal spots, blood smears on sheets, and molts.

Bed bugs can be found singly, but often congregate once established. They usually remain close to hosts, commonly in or near beds or couches. Harborage areas can vary greatly, however, including luggage, vehicles, furniture and bedside clutter. Bed bugs may also nest near animals that have nested within a dwelling, such as bats, birds,&lt;ref name=&quot;avianadvice.uark.edu&quot;/&gt; or [[rodents]]. The eggs of bed bugs are found in similar places where the bed bugs themselves are found, and are attached to surfaces by a sticky substance.

Attractant devices for detection use heat and/or [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name=diydetector/&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2011}}

Bed bugs can be detected by their characteristic smell of cilantro, coriander, almonds or over-ripe raspberries. [[Bed bug detection dogs]] are trained to pinpoint infestations, with a possible accuracy rate of 97.5%, based upon tests conducted under controlled conditions by researchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;birc.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Pfiester | first1 = Margie |last2 = Koehler | first2 = Philip G. |last3 = Pereira| first3 = Roberto M. |title = Ability of Bed Bug-Detecting Canines to Locate Live Bed Bugs and Viable Bed Bug Eggs |publisher = Entomological Society of America | year = 2008 | month = Aug |url = http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1603/0022-0493%282008%29101%5B1389%3AAOBBCT%5D2.0.CO%3B2?journalCode=ecen#FN1 |accessdate = 26 Aug 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success rates in these tests may not reflect real world success rates of a pest companiesâ dogs, operating with many more variables in the field.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;Buckley, Cara, &quot;Doubts Rise on Bedbug-Sniffing Dogs&quot;, ''[[The New York Times (New York)|The New York Times]]'' of New York, New York, p 1, November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Dog detection can often occur in minutes where a pest control practitioner might need an hour.

===Management===
{{main|Bed bug control techniques}}

Eradication of bed bugs frequently requires a combination of [[pesticide]] and non-pesticide approaches.&lt;ref name=JAMA2009&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jerome Goddard &amp; Richard deShazo |year=2009 |title=Bed bugs (''Cimex lectularius'') and clinical consequences of their bites |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]] |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/301/13/1358 |volume=301 |issue=13 |pages=1358â1366 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.405 |pmid=19336711}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolb2009&quot;/&gt; Pesticides that have historically been found to be effective include: [[pyrethroid]]s, [[dichlorvos]] and [[malathion]].&lt;ref name=Kolb2009/&gt; Resistance to pesticides has increased significantly over time and there are concerns of [[Health effects of pesticides|negative health effects]] from their use.&lt;ref name=JAMA2009/&gt;  Mechanical approaches such as vacuuming up the insects and heat treating or wrapping mattresses have been recommended.&lt;ref name=JAMA2009/&gt;

The [[carbamate]] insecticide [[propoxur]] is highly toxic to bed bugs, but in the United States the [[US Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]] has been reluctant to approve such an indoor use because of its potential toxicity to children after chronic exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/05/opinion/05sun3.html?ref=opinion New York Times.

''C. lectularius'' may have originated in the Middle East, in [[caves]] inhabited by [[bat]]s and humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance A. Durden 2002, p. 80&quot;/&gt;

Bed bugs were mentioned in ancient Greece as early as 400 BC, and were later mentioned by [[Aristotle]]. [[Pliny's Natural History|Pliny's ''Natural History'']], first published circa 77 AD in Rome, claimed bed bugs had medicinal value in treating ailments such as snake bites and ear infections. (Belief in the medicinal use of bed bugs persisted until at least the 18th century, when [[Guettard]] recommended their use in the treatment of [[hysteria]].&lt;ref&gt;William Smith and Charles Anthon, ''A dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities'', 1847, pp. 252-253 http://books.google.com/books?id=41oMAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=cimex&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt;) Bed bugs were first mentioned in Germany in the 11th century, in France in the 13th century and in England in 1583,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lance A. Durden 2002, p. 80&quot;/&gt; though they remained rare in England until 1670. Some in the 18th century believed bed bugs had been brought to London with supplies of wood to rebuild the city after the [[Great Fire of London]] (1666). [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] noted their presence in [[Carniola]] (roughly equivalent to present-day Slovenia) in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;That soon after the Fire of London, in some of the new-built Houses they were observ'd to appear, and were never noted to have been seen in the old, tho' they were then so few, as to be little taken notice of; yet as they were only seen in Firr-Timber, 'twas conjectured they were then first brought to ''England'' in them; of which most of the new Houses were partly built, instead of the good Oak destroy'd in the old.&quot; John Southall, ''A Treatise of Buggs'' [sic], pp. 16-17. http://www.archive.org/details/atreatisebuggss00soutgoog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;According to Scopoli's 2nd work (loc. cit.), found in Carniola and adjoining regions.

Traditional methods of repelling and/or killing bed bugs include the use of plants, fungi, and insects (or their extracts), such as [[black pepper]],&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'', 1933&lt;/ref&gt; [[black cohosh]] (''Actaea racemosa''), ''Pseudarthria hookeri'', ''Laggera alata'' (Chinese ''yÃ¡ngmÃ¡o cÇo'' | ç¾æ¯è),&lt;ref name=&quot;birc.org&quot;/&gt; ''[[Eucalyptus saligna]]'' oil,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Schaefer | first1 = C.W. | last2 = Pazzini | first2 = A.R. |title = Heteroptera of Economic Importance |publisher = CRC Press | date = 28 July 2000 | location = Boca Raton, FL |page = 525 |url = http://books.google.com/?id=AVcBI0GL-fQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Heteroptera%20of%20Economic%20Importance&amp;pg=PA525#v=onepage&amp;q=eucalyptus |isbn = 0849306957 }}

Basket-work panels were put around beds and shaken out in the morning, in the UK and in France in the 19th century.

Prior to the mid-twentieth century, bed bugs were very common.
