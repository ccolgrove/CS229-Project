While completing the required coursework, she had to return to Hong Kong to take up her responsibilities at Yew Chung. Returning to the USA to pursue her doctorate, she entered the program at Union Institute (renamed The Union Institute and University in 2001) under the supervision of co-founder of the institute, Prof. Roy P. Fairfield (Harvard), whose philosophy of âa university without wallsâ became a widely accepted model. She was awarded her Ph.D. in 1985.
