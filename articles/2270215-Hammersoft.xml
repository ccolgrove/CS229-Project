'''Abdul Mati Klarwein''' (April 9, 1932 &amp;ndash; March 7, 2002) was a [[Painting|painter]] best known for his works used on the covers of music albums.

==Biography==
Klarwein was born in [[Hamburg]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]]. His family was of [[Jew]]ish origin and fled to the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] when he was two years old, after the rise of [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1948 when the territory became [[Israel]], his family traveled to Paris. There Mati studied with [[Fernand LÃ©ger]], after attending the [[Ãcole des Beaux-Arts]]. Klarwein traveled south to [[Saint-Tropez]] and met [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]], who would have a profound influence on him. Leaving France in the 1950s, Klarwein traveled widely and lived in many different countries, including [[Tibet]], India, [[Bali]], North Africa, [[Turkey]], Europe and the [[Americas]]. He settled in New York City in the early 1960s for while meeting [[Jimi Hendrix]] and many others.

Much of Klarwein's most famous work is inspired by [[surrealism]] and [[pop culture]], but also reflects his interest in non-Western deities, symbolism, and landscapes. The alleged connection between Klarwein and the so-called [[psychedelic]] art of the period is not entirely unfounded, as he has detailed his experience with LSD in his 1988 book ''Collected Works''; however, Klarwein also explains that drugs were never his prime inspirational source,&lt;ref&gt;Mati Klarwein: Collected Works 1959-1975; Harmony Books, New York, Â©1988&lt;/ref&gt; and in one interview, denies their influence entirely. His extensive travels and wide interests (notwithstanding the fact that his style had fully developed before the &quot;psychedelic era&quot;) are further support of his claims.  Klarwein claims that his friend Timothy Leary once told him, based on the character of his paintings, that Klarwein &quot;didn't need psychedelics.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20070807204534/http://www.levity.com/mavericks/mati.htm Internet Archive: Mati Klarwein Interview&lt;/ref&gt;

In his painting ''Grain of Sand'' (1963â1965), many disparate images are combined together in one massive, yet oddly coherent work. Klarwein's own words illuminate the work: &quot;I projected it as a sort of painted musical comedy movie with a Sanskrit swinging cast of thousands, starring [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Anita Ekberg]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Roland Kirk]], [[Cannonball Adderley]], [[Ahmed Abdul Malik]], [[Wonderwoman]], Delacroix's [[Orphan Girl at the Cemetery]], [[Litri]] and his bullshit fighters, [[Lawrence of Arabia]], [[Socrates]], [[Salvador DalÃ­|DalÃ­]], Rama, [[Vishnu]], [[Ganesh]], the Zork and a Milky Way of playmates.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matiklarweinart.com/en/gallery/grain-of-sand-1963-1965.htm Grain of Sand by Mati Klarwein - Surrealist and Visionary Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

Klarwein added &quot;Abdul&quot; (which means &quot;servant&quot; in Arabic) to his name in the late 1950s to express his sentiments about the hostility between Jews and Muslims in the [[Middle East]]: he felt that to understand each other better, every Jew should adopt a Muslim first name, and vice-versa.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_2_41/ai_93213709  Really Fantastic: Glenn O'Brien on Mati Klarwein - Slant - Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; He is not known to have converted to [[Islam]]. He removed the name when, in 1960, he approached jazz musician [[Yusef Lateef]] after a concert. Lateef, who had previously expressed interest in using Klarwein's work for a future album cover, saw that Klarwein was white, and turned away without a word.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;[http://www.jonhassell.com/mati.html lush life: mati klarwein by Rob Young]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Actually, the compound &quot;abdul&quot; means &quot;servant ''of''&quot;, and should be followed by one of the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|names of Allah]], so this name is somewhat nonsensical and may even appear blasphemous to a Muslim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this unfortunate encounter, during the 1960s Klarwein's work would be appreciated and utilized on several records by some of the decade's most progressive musicians. Klarwein's painting ''Annunciation'' (1961) was seen in reproduction by the musician [[Carlos Santana]], who subsequently used it as the cover image of his band [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s second album ''[[Abraxas (album)|Abraxas]]'' (1970). In the following years Klarwein produced comparably striking designs for the covers of two [[Miles Davis]] albums, ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1969) and ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' (1971), as well as a portrait of Jimi Hendrix, [http://www.matiklarweinart.com/en/gallery/jimi-hendrix-1970.htm#title] which was supposed to have been used for the guitarist's collaboration album with big band leader [[Gil Evans]], which never came to fruition due to the guitarist's death.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; His painting ''Zonked'' (1970), originally planned for use on a [[Betty Davis]] album of the same name,&lt;ref name=Young/&gt; would later be used as the cover of a [[Last Poets]] album ''Holy Terror'' (1995). (For a complete list of albums which feature Klarwein's art, see below.) The association of his images with these very successful and widely admired counterculture musicians made Klarwein's work known outside the circle of lovers of contemporary art. Many of these paintings, and others, were included in Klarwein's first book ''Milk n' Honey'' (1973).

During the 1960s and 70s, Klarwein would occasionally search for cheap paintings at flea markets and &quot;improve&quot; them, painting over them or adding things at his whim. Klarwein made over a hundred of these &quot;improved paintings&quot; throughout his career.&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;

In the mid-1970s, Klarwein began a series of paintings which he referred to as &quot;real-estate paintings&quot; or &quot;[[inscape (visual art)|inscapes]]&quot;. In the late 1970s he collaborated with trumpeter [[Jon Hassell]] for a couple albums on [[Brian Eno]]'s Ambient label; these albums used several of Klarwein's &quot;inscapes&quot; on their covers. Klarwein also contributed art to three albums by [[Per Tjernberg]].&lt;ref name=Young/&gt;

Klarwein is still best known for his art of the 1960s and 1970s, with its clear links to [[surrealism]] (Klarwein studied with [[Salvador DalÃ­]] and the [[Vienna School of Fantastic Realism|Viennese Fantastic Realist]] [[Ernst Fuchs (artist)|Ernst Fuchs]]), popular [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]] imagery, and religious art from a number of different traditions. He also worked more conventionally across a variety of genres including [[still life]], [[Landscape art|landscape]], and [[portrait]].

He died of [[cancer]] on March 7, 2002, in [[DeiÃ ]], on the Spanish island of [[Majorca]].
