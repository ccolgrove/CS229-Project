==Accounts shut down by YouTube and Yahoo==
In September 2007, his YouTube account was shut down.&lt;ref name=CNNNov29/&gt; All the videos he had sent to YouTube were no longer available. They included videos of police brutality, voting irregularities and anti-government protests. About 12 or 13 were of violence in police stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReutersNov27&quot;&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL27590430.html YouTube stops account of Egypt anti-torture activist] [[Reuters]], 27 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was shocked by YouTube's decision.&lt;ref name=CNNNov29/&gt;

Yahoo had shut down two of his email accounts, accusing him of being a spammer.&lt;ref name=CNNNov29/&gt;

Human rights groups said that YouTube was shutting down a useful source of info on abuses in Egypt just as the government was increasing its crackdown on independent and opposition journalists.&lt;ref name=ReutersNov27/&gt; Twelve Egyptian journalists had been jailed between September and November 2007.&lt;ref name=ReutersNov27/&gt; Elijah Zarwan thinks that it was unlikely YouTube was reacting to official government pressure.&lt;ref name=ReutersNov27/&gt;

YouTube initially restored his account but not his videos, and said that his account was blocked because he failed to provide sufficient context about the violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReutersDec03&quot;&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL0316580920071203?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews YouTube restores account of Egypt anti-torture blogger] [[Reuters]], December 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 187 of his videos were subsequently restored.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashingtonPost&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/16/AR2007121601559.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 Egypt's YouTube Democrats] [[Washington Post]] editorial, December 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Abbas has posted on his blog that Yahoo has restored his email account.&lt;ref name=&quot;YoutubeHoax&quot;&gt;[http://misrdigital.blogspirit.com/archive/2007/12/05/the-hoax-of-restoring-my-account-by-youtube.html Blog post by Wael Abbas] December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
