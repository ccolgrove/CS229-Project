The '''Bronze Stalk Trophy ''' is presented to the winner of the annual [[American football|college football]] game between [[Mid-American Conference]] rivals [[Northern Illinois University]] and [[Ball State University]]. The two interstate rivals began competing for this trophy in [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.niuhuskies.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112107aaa.html |title = Northern Illinois and Ball State to Play for The Bronze Stalk |date= November 21, 2007 |publisher= NIUhuskies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Designed by nationally recognized sculptor and local DeKalb artist Renee Bemis, the trophy depicts several cornstalks in tribute to the prevalence of maize around the respective home states of the rivals.

The first meeting between the two occurred in 1941, a 6-6 tie; the Cardinals control the all-time series at 20-16-2, but the Huskies have surged back, winning 9 of the last 12 meetings. Ball State won the inaugural contest for the Bronze Stalk at [[Scheumann Stadium]] in 2008, with Northern Illinois taking back the trophy the following season on [[Brigham Field at Huskie Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mac/northern_illinois/opponents.php&lt;/ref&gt;.
