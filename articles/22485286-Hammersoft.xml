The '''Battle for the Bone''' is the [[college football]] [[List of NCAA college football rivalry games|rivalry game]] between the [[Fresno State Bulldogs football|Fresno State Bulldogs]] and the [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech Bulldogs]]. Since 2001, the teams have played annually as members of the [[Western Athletic Conference]], and Fresno State holds a 7â4 series lead in games played as [[Western Athletic Conference|WAC]] foes. Prior to the conference rivalry, the two Bulldog football teams played twice in Fresno with Fresno State defeating Louisiana Tech 34â10 in 1986 and 48â14 in 1992.

With Fresno State's upcoming move to the [[Mountain West Conference]] in 2012, the future of the rivalry is in doubt.
