Manfred &quot;Manny&quot;, is a [[woolly mammoth]], shown as one of the main protagonists in all three ''[[Ice Age (film series)|Ice Age]]'' films. He can be serious, but is otherwise caring and friendly. In the first film, while passing through the icy cavern, the herd discovers [[cave painting]]s of mammoths who were killed by [[Paleo-Indian]] hunters; this is an emotional moment for Manny, indicating that the pictures could be him and showing us his history or also indicating that something similar happened. At the end of the film, Manny and Sid return Roshan to the [[Paleo-Indian]]s with an injured Diego trailing behind them. He finds love with Ellie in [[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]. In [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]], he has a daughter named Peaches. He will reappear in the upcoming Ice Age movie, [[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]. He is voiced by [[Ray Romano]].

Diego is a [[saber-toothed tiger]], one of the main protagonists in all three of the films. He has a somewhat sarcastic personality, although it's usually not intended as malicious. He was sent by his pack to retrieve the human baby called Roshan; When he found Roshan in Manny and Sid's care, he pretended to lead them to the humans, but instead planned to lead them into an ambush by the pack. However, when Manny saved his life Diego changed his mind, telling him about the pack and helping to counterattack. He appeared to have been killed by the pack's leader, Soto, but survived and joined Manny and Sid on their travels. In the [[second film]], he was revealed to suffer from [[aquaphobia]], but he eventually conquered it in order to save Sid, Eddie and Crash. In the third film, he began to fear that he was losing his predatory abilities from being in the &quot;herd&quot; too long, and considered staying in the underground dinosaur world. He changed his mind after managing to save the labored Ellie from a dinosaur attack. He will reappear in the upcoming Ice Age movie, [[Ice Age: Continental Drift]], while having a love interest in the movie with another [[Smilodon]] named Shira, voiced by [[Jennifer Lopez]]. He is voiced by [[Denis Leary]].

'''Scrat''' is a saber-toothed [[squirrel]] who is obsessed with [[acorn]]s, constantly putting his life in danger to obtain and defend them. He has his own stories in the film, independent of the main plot, which are parallel with the journeys of the other main characters, causing them to interact with him at times.

The character is enormously successful and Scrat is viewed as a [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], the most popular of the franchise. In a special feature in the second film's DVD, his name has been stated to be a mix of the words &quot;[[squirrel]]&quot; and &quot;[[rat]]&quot;, his species allegedly believed to have been a common ancestor of both. In the ''Ice Age'' [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], he is referred to as &quot;The Scrat&quot; by directors [[Chris Wedge]] and [[Carlos Saldanha]].

Scrat is voiced in all ''Ice Age'' movies and short films by director Chris Wedge. He directly interacts with the story's main characters on six occasions. In the first film, he attacks Sid when the latter tries to eat his acorn, successfully regaining it, and later appears when Manny asks him for directions to where the baby's family is and Diego kicks Scrat away before he could tell about nearby saber-toothed tigers. At the end of the second film, Scrat creates a hole in the valley and releases all the melted ice. He later attacks Sid for saving his life (when he had already died and gone to paradise and was about to eat a giant acorn). In the third film, Scrat is stepped on by Manny and falls into Sid's head while chasing his acorn. Finally, he appears when Sid's &quot;children&quot; are batting a ball around, the ball actually being Scrat.

Scrat constantly hunts for his acorn either to bury it or eat it, but fate always gets in the way. He invariably ends up in humorous or  painful situations: being struck by lightning, pursued by avalanches, and repeatedly knocked unconscious while fighting for his acorn. Yet he never gives up. Scrat generally loses, except when he defeats a school of piranhas and successfully battles [[List of Ice Age characters#Sid|Sid]] for his acorn.

Scrat appears in ''[[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]]''. He constantly interacts with a female saber-toothed squirrel named Scratte, being torn between his love for her and the acorn. Scrat is supposedly the only character to survive the [[ice age]], as at the end of the first movie he was frozen in ice. He thaws out 20,000 years later on a tropical beach, where he causes an eruption. Scrat is never referred to by name in the films. He is only named in the credits.

Scrat is the main character in three short films. In the first, ''[[Gone Nutty]]'', he loses his collection of [[acorn]]s in a catastrophic chain of events. He jams his acorn into a hole in the middle of the collection, which shatters the pile and with it the entire continent - which begins the [[continental drift]].

In the second film, ''[[No Time for Nuts]]'', Scrat finds a [[time travel|time machine]] left by a time-traveler and visits several historical events. He becomes trapped in a frightening future when oak trees have become extinct, but somehow manages to return to the series' time period.

A third Scrat short, ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]'', was released in 2010 accompanying the feature ''[[Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)|Gulliver's Travels]]'', and later with ''[[Rio (film)|Rio]]'' as a promotion for the fourth Ice Age movie ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swift injustice |first=James |last=Verniere |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/view.bg?articleid=1305330&amp;srvc=home&amp;position=also |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |date=2010-12-25 |accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scrat also has a cameo in ''[[Surviving Sid]]'' which was important to the plot.

Scrat is the main character in the [[Ice Age: The Meltdown#Video game|''Ice Age: The Meltdown'' video game]]. He is also playable in the other two games based on the series.

Scrat also appears in the 22nd Episode of Season 4 in the [[Family Guy]] television series.

The origin of Scrat is disputed. Cartoon designer [[Ivy Supersonic]] claims she created the character in 1999, after seeing a squirrel-rat hybrid in [[Skidmore College]]'s Case Green. She called her character &quot;Sqrat&quot; and says she presented the idea to 20th Century Fox movie executives. A CNN report by Jeanie Moos of Ivy's discovery was aired in 2000, two years before ''Ice Age'' went into development. Supersonic claims the studio's own documents actually identified the character in ''Ice Age'' as &quot;Sqrat&quot;, though her creation was not sabre-toothed.&lt;ref name=&quot;sqrat&quot;&gt;http://ivysmedia.com/scrat/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivy Supersonic was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox Studios. She turned it down and subsequently lost in court. The case is currently in appeal (Case # 04401 Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, NYC). She still has hopes of receiving damages for her claimed infringement.&lt;ref name=sqrat/&gt;

Supersonic did win a partial summary judgement from the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] in a reverse suit, Fox Film Corporation v. Ivy Silberstein (her real name), in which Fox had tried to prevent her from registering the trade mark &quot;SQRAT&quot;. [http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/ttabvue-91156005-OPP-21.pdf]

According to Wedge, artist Peter de Seve came up with the design for Scrat after a visit to the [[Museum of Natural History]]. Wedge called it &quot;sort of a squirrel based on some lemur.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/110509845.html?dids=110509845:110509845&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+15%2C+2002&amp;author=Susan+Wloszczyna&amp;pub=USA+TODAY&amp;desc=Scrounging%2C+screeching+Scrat+is+nutty+hit+of+%27Ice+Age%27&amp;pqatl=google|title=Scrounging, screeching Scrat is nutty hit of 'Ice Age'|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|date=15 March 2002|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While initially created as a fictional species for comedic purposes, in 2011 scientists have discovered a mammal quite similar to Scrat. The newly described taxon, ''[[Cronopio (mammal)|Cronopio dentiacutus]]'' wasn't a true squirrel nor it did live in Cenozoic era. Instead it was a [[Dryolestoidea|dryolestoid]] a group of mammals distantly related to [[therians]] and it lived around 100 million years ago in Patagonia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.care2.com/causes/saber-toothed-squirrel-skulls-found-live-100-million-years-ago.html&lt;/ref&gt; The precedence of the animated character to the discovery of the real one is an example of what is known as the &quot;[[Dim Effect]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ratclie, B.C.|title=A remarkable new species of ''Megaceras'' from Peru (Scarabaeidae: Dynastinae: Oryctini).

'''Roshan''' or '''Pinky''' was the baby that Manfred, Sid and Diego returned to his father.

Roshan is the young son of a human tribe chieftain. While sleeping one morning, his tribe is attacked by a pack of smilodons. The leader of the pack, Soto, wants Roshan as revenge for Roshan's father Runar killing half the pack and using their skin as clothes and their flesh as food. His mother, Nadia, is able to fend off Diego, whose mission is to retrieve him. However, she is cornered over a waterfall and, in a desperate attempt to save her son, leaps over the waterfall, holding Roshan tightly in her arms. They are both found by Manfred and Sid at the riverside. Using what little strength she has left, she gives Roshan to Manfred and Sid in hopes that he will be safe with them.

Roshan's prime care-giver is Sid, the only member of the group who initially has any interest in him, Manny being too cynical to care and Diego secretly planning to kill him.  Manny, after his previous experience with humans, is reluctant to have anything to do with the toddler, but eventually bonds with him.  At the end of the movie, Roshan is reunited with his tribe. Runar is particularly happy to learn that the baby has learned to walk during his time with Manny, Sid, and Diego.

===Soto===

The deadly and dangerous leader of a pack of saber-toothed tigers, Soto wants to eat Roshan in vengeance for the murders of several of his pack-mates. He is the main antagonist in the first film.

As part of his plan to take Roshan, Soto plans an attack on the human camp so that while he and three other saber-teeth would attack the humans, Diego would slip in, unnoticed, and take Roshan. Diego fails at this task, and Soto is not pleased, telling Diego to bring Roshan to Half-Peak where he would meet with the others. Soto dispatched his fellow pack members Zeke and Oscar to warn Diego to hurry and bring Roshan or not return at all, though was reciprocated with the news that alongside Roshan, Soto would receive a mammoth.

Soto eventually made it with his pack to Half Peak and informed Diego that while he had his doubts, he was pleased that Diego had made it. Soon it would happen that unbeknownst to Soto, Diego was in league with both Manfred and Sid, and so Sid would lure Soto and his pack-mates away from both Manfred and Roshan with a decoy made of snow.

Soto made his way to the end of the altercation in which he made an attempt to kill Manfred, but was stopped by Diego, whom he severely wounded. Thereafter, Manfred smacked Soto into a wall of ice, knocking loose a row of icicles, the sharp ice formations falling, and end up killing the sabertooth.

Soto was voiced by [[Goran Visnjic]].

He is led by Soto, out to seek a human baby called Roshan and kill him. Zeke is dark-gray and looked mangy, as well as acting the part of a suck up. It is revealed in a deleted scene that he, like the other members of his pack, wanted very much to follow the &quot;walking buffet&quot; south, but Soto would not hear of it. Zeke accompanied Oscar to tell Diego to hurry up and bring back Roshan or not to come back. He soon made it along with the rest of his pack to Half Peak, where he tried to catch Sid and Roshan, but was stopped by Sid after he was stomped into a tiny tree with his hindquarters sticking out.

One of the pack members Diego was expected to steal the baby Roshan from the humans but missed his chance when Roshan's mother Nadia escaped with her child through a waterfall. Angry at Diego's failure the pack leader Soto orders him to retrieve Roshan and bring him to Half Peack where the others will be waiting. Soto was later informed by other pack member's Zeke and Oscar that Diego will bring Roshan back along with a wooly Mammoth called Manny who has been caring for Roshan along with Sid the sloth.

Lenny met up with Diego along with the other members of the pack at Half Peack where Zeke reminisced the joys of mammoth flesh much to Lenny's displeasure (saying his only lines in the film, &quot;Hey, knock it off. I'm starving!&quot; and &quot;I told you to knock it off!&quot;). He then demanded Zeke to stop talking about food and then tries to hit him but is stopped by Soto who tells him to save energy as mammoths don't go down easily. Soto plans an ambush on Manny so he would be caught by surprise and so he ordered the pack not to attack until they saw Manny but Diego secretly turned on his pack after he had be shown real compassion and caring from Manny and Sid so he Tempted Zeke to leap into action and attack. The surprise been given away the pack pursue Sid as he slides down a snowy slope on a piece of bark soon after Lenny and Oscar who had been chasing Sid where impeded by a large log Manny threw at them. Once they recovered they saw that Soto had been killed when he tried to attack Manny and that Diego had intervened Soto's attacks.

}}
Runar was the chief of a human tribe shown in the first film.

Runar was a leader for a group of humans. He was the father of Roshan and husband of Nadia, and cared greatly for his family, all the while leading them and the rest of the tribe as a nomadic group to travel from place to place. In one encampment that his tribe set up, half a pack of saber-toothed tigers was killed and the furs taken as coats and clothing. In vengeance, the leader saber-tooth named Soto decided to plan an attack on Runar's tribe so as to take his son Roshan and kill him in vengeance for those saber-teeth slain in battle by Runar's tribe. The attack almost worked, but Runar's tribe had [[gray wolf|wolves]] that detected Soto's pack coming and the human tribe did battle with the saber-teeth, with Soto fighting directly with Runar. In the melee, the baby Roshan was taken by his mother from a saber-toothed tiger named Diego, and the hunters successfully warded off the saber-teeth only to find out that his son had disappeared and his wife was gone.

Runar had no choice left but to begin the travel to another camp far off, tracking the treacherous saber-teeth on the way and finding clues as to his son's whereabouts. In time, Runar made it near the settlement and was finally re-united with his son, but not before meeting face-to-face with Manfred and Sid, the two animals who returned the child. Runar was on his guard about Manfred at first, as Manfred appeared hostile, but quickly came to see that Manfred meant no ill will, simply to return the child.

Runar thanked Manfred by giving him the charm bracelet that had once been Roshan's, and with that Runar left the scene with his tribe and his son in tow.

===Nadia===

Nadia was the wife of the chief of a Paleo-Indian tribe shown in the first film.

Nadia had a husband, Runar, and a baby son, Roshan. She and her family lived a peaceful life together with their tribe until the day when a pack of saber-toothed cats invaded their camp to abduct the youngest member, Roshan. Nadia staved off an attack on Roshan long enough to run away quickly from the saber-toothed tiger who was pursuing her. Nadia ran with Roshan in her arms until she reached a great waterfall and was cornered. She jumped, holding on tightly to her son all the while; she then ended up on the riverbank below, meeting Manny and Sid, two animals that were passing by. With her limited strength, Nadia nudged her son to these animals in the hopes that they could be entrusted with her son. Seconds after this act, she slipped slowly from the riverbank, disappearing completely. Her fate remains unknown, although it is presumed that she is dead.

Dab was the head dodo shown in the first film. He serves as a minor antagonist in the film.

Dab had the dodos collect three melons for a stockpile and one of them stole the melon that Manfred spotted for Rohan. The first one falls in the lower ground with 5 dodos and the second one falls to the tar of death with 3 dodos. After Sid fights off the dodos, they fall off a cliff, a joke on why there are none left.

Carl and Frank are two [[brontothere]]s. Carl had thick lips and a thick horn, while Frank had more pointed lips and a thinner horn.

The two appeared at the beginning of the film when Sid the [[ground sloth|sloth]] was shown stepping on their salad and eating an important part of it, the [[dandelion]]. The two animals soon chased after him in the hopes of killing him, but were stopped forcefully by Manny the mammoth, by being hurled through the air. They'd held a powerful grudge against Sid for what he'd done and when they next saw him, he was in the same hot mud pool that they were in and was erroneously referring to them as ladies. Again, Carl and Frank stampeded after the hapless sloth, but were waylaid when they saw that he had already been &quot;killed&quot; by a saber-toothed cat named Diego (which was part of Sid's plan to get them to be fooled into leaving him alone and not trying to kill him off), and gave up their chase post-haste stating that &quot;carnivores always have the most fun.&quot; They referred to Sid as an Overgrown Weasel

Carl was voiced by [[Cedric the Entertainer]] and Frank was voiced by [[Stephen Root]].

Jennifer and Rachel are two female ground sloths from the first film.

The two were shown being sweet-talked by Sid to impress them while he had the baby Rohan in tow. Jennifer admitted that she found some of Sid's qualities to be most attractive, and when Sid left, the two spoke to each other on how, despite his lack of good looks, he was a family-type.

These two female sloths (in a deleted scene from the film) were shown scorning Sid when he was shown to simply be using the baby to mate with them, though Rachel was much more straightforward as she kicked him directly in the groin while calling him &quot;''pig''&quot;.

Jennifer was a thickset dark-blue sloth with short curly hair and Rachel was considerably thinner and had light tan fur and a blonde ponytail directly at the top of her head.

Jennifer was voiced by [[Lorri Bagley]] and Rachel was voiced by [[Jane Krakowski]].

Sylvia is a female ground sloth who was cut from the first Ice Age film, but can be found in the deleted scenes of the 2-Disc DVD release.

Sylvia was shown waylaying Sid into traveling with her, for she was seeking commitment. Sid, not wanting any of this, had her sent off as he managed to put her in the path of some running glyptodonts. Sylvia eventually found him again, though this time, she found him and was still adamant to go migrating with him. Sid agreed and told her that he would leave her for a moments to get turnips so as to stuff their cheeks to migrate, but rather ran off to escape from her without her knowing it, and she followed him to where she found him: in the jaws of Diego, the saber-toothed cat. She did not believe that Sid was truly dead, and sullenly told Diego to &quot;eat him&quot;. It is presumed that after that, she left alone. Sylvia had red-colored fur and red, untidy hair. 

According to the Ice Age DVD commentaries, the scenes with her were cut because of two reasons. The first reason was for timing purposes; although the scenes with her were funny, they took up a lot of time and didn't focus on the main plot. The second reason was because of Sid's behavior towards her; considering that the creators of the movie were still experimenting with Sid's personality, they found out that Sid was acting a bit mean towards her during these cut scenes and decided to take them out. Also according to these commentaries, there was an alternate ending to the first movie. After Sid and Manny head south and met up with the other animals (they headed south without Diego because in earlier drafts of the movie Diego died and never came back). In this alternate ending Sid matured and was a bit nicer to Sylvia.

Even though she was a cut character, she was cut from the movie fairly late. Most of the sequences with her were completely animated and rendered (and usually when it comes to animated films scenes usually get cut in the storyboard phases). Sylvia was also seen in earlier trailers of the movie as well as early ads and posters.

Sylvia was voiced by [[Kristen Johnston]].

Ellie is a female woolly mammoth, whom Manny, Diego, and Sid meet during their migration to escape the flood in the second movie, [[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]. She is also one of the new protagonists in the second film.

It was revealed that when Ellie was young, she was separated from her herd during the [[ice age]]. She came across two [[opossums]] named Crash and Eddie, along with their mother. She later forgot her origins and thought that she was an opossum.

Manny met her when he was afraid that he truly was the last mammoth, and he was overjoyed that he had found another of his kind, but got a surprise when he saw that Ellie believed that she was an opossum. Nevertheless, he and his herd (or rather, Sid) welcomed Ellie and her brothers to travel with them. During this time, Ellie displayed the mannerisms pertaining to an opossum as well as insisting (despite obvious proof that she was not a possum) and this was weighing heavily on Manny's patience, namely when she claimed that the act of bravery that he had done of fighting off the sea reptile Cretaceous was dumb.

Soon, Manny got his time to be alone with Ellie when he and Ellie went for a walk through a wooded area, where Ellie had a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] that told her of her past. Upon remembering this, she knew that she was a mammoth, but was soon angered at Manny for implying that they must mate in order to save the mammoths from extinction, but in time, she apologized for over-reacting. She and Manny also slowly fall in love now and the next morning when they resumed travel, this affinity did not seem to end.

Soon, however, this new &quot;herd&quot; reached a horrible obstacle between them and safety from the oncoming flood: a field of geysers, which Manny explained must be crossed, but Ellie would not listen: she and her brothers felt that they must go around. But this proved to be disastrous: as they were trying to reach their destination, some rocks caved down and nearly crushed Ellie and her brothers, but trapped them instead in a sort of cave. Manny rescued Ellie, for the water was flooding into the cave where she was trapped and had nearly drowned Ellie. She and Manfred escaped and regrouped with the others, but faced another problem, for the waters were still rising.

Eventually, however, the waters subsided and to top it all off, a herd of mammoths made their way into the valley. Manny thought that because the mammoths had come, that Ellie would not want to remain with him. Manfred was persuaded otherwise by Sid and Diego and soon caught up with Ellie and confessed his feelings, saying that he wanted to be together not because they had to be, but because he himself wanted to. Ellie accepts him as her mate. The mammoths trumpet while Manny and Ellie embrace. Manfred and Ellie decide to stay with their old friends, taking along Sid, Diego, and the possum brothers.

In [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]], she and Manny are mates and Ellie is pregnant with their first child. When they find the Dinosaur World under their feet, they have to go in and search for Sid in Lava Falls. When very close to Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labour, and gives birth to Peaches (which was the codeword for if Ellie went into labor on the trip). When they return to the surface, Ellie introduces Peaches to her new home.

She will reappear in the upcoming Ice Age movie, [[Ice Age: Continental Drift]].

===Crash and Eddie===
{{Infobox character

}}
Crash and Eddie were two twin brother opossums and new protagonists in the second film. Adopted brothers of Ellie the mammoth, they cared for her and taught her to hang by her tail from a tree branch when she slept, as they did.

They first made their presence known to the opening characters by means of shooting pebbles (or possibly [[spitballs]]) through reeds at Sid and Diego, then baiting them so as to humiliate them, but Diego began chasing them, leading both Sid and Diego to Ellie. After much persuasion, Ellie and her brothers joined Manny, Sid, and Diego, though Crash and Eddie spared almost no opportunity in bothering Diego.

As they traveled with Manny and his friends, Ellie grew closer to Manny, putting both Crash and Eddie somewhat closer to Manny and his friends, but creating a short grudge when Manny tried &quot;hitting on&quot; Ellie. In time, however, they saw behind the petty grudges and worked together with Manny, Sid, and Diego to escape the flood, but left with Ellie when she left Manny and his friends to cross the minefield, as she claimed that it was suicide to cross it. Crash and Eddie joined Ellie in trying to escape the flood, but soon ran into trouble when they were trapped in a cave.

Ellie insisted that they leave her to the point of pushing them outwards from a small crevice, but they promised to return with help, and true to their word, sought out Manny to try and free Ellie. They eventually made their way into a rushing current of water and were almost swept away when a foolish Sid came along to jump into the current, leaving them, in addition to holding onto a branch for dear life against the current of water, trying to hold onto an unconscious Sid. Diego eventually helped when he jumped in and saved them from drowning along with Sid. When Manny had saved Ellie from drowning, they helped Ellie back onto solid ground, but almost drowned when the flood was encroaching.

Eventually however, the waters drained, leaving Crash, Eddie, and all of the others alive. When a herd of mammoths came by (as mammoths were presumed all but extinct), they thought that Ellie would go with them and leave Manny, so they went with her. But as it turned out, Manny and Ellie stayed together because they wanted to, rather than being obligated to, and so they left onwards with Sid and Diego, as well as Crash and Eddie.

In the third film, Crash and Eddie travel with the others to the dinosaur jungle to save Sid from Momma, and both grow to idolize Buck, the one-eyed dinosaur-hunting weasel who helped them find Sid. In the third film, they also mentioned they never liked Sid but this was not true because they helped Buck to save him when he was going to die.

All in all, they love each other very much as shown in both the films.

Crash had a flatter nose than Eddie, had blue eyes and was voiced by [[Seann William Scott]] and Eddie had a pointed nose, brown eyes and was voiced by [[Josh Peck]]. Their mom is Mother Opossum, who first saved Ellie when Crash and Eddie were very small.

Crash and Eddie will reappear in the upcoming Ice Age movie, [[Ice Age: Continental Drift]].

===Fast Tony===

| data4       = Peach
}}
An armadillo living in the days of the Ice Age, Fast Tony was a con-man trying to give off items such as reeds and bark to other denizens of the Ice Age so as to escape the world's end, which by chance, he predicted and it came true. Fast Tony would give off products in exchange for whatever the other animals would bring by with the help of his &quot;''assistant''&quot;, an insipid [[glyptodont]] named Stu. He was notoriously amoral with others, even being criticized by Manny for willing to sell off ''&quot;his own mother for a [[grape]]&quot;''. Fast Tony immediately asked if that was an offer, then pretended he had not thought of it for the benefit of the watching animals.

Stu was more Fast Tony's guinea pig to prove their wares' worth, rather than his actual partner and proved more useful dead than alive, as Fast Tony had taken Stu's shell (as Stu had just been killed by Maelstrom and Cretaceous) and shamelessly tried to pawn it off to other animals as a personal &quot;''mobile home''&quot;.

Fast Tony was last seen at the end of [[Ice Age: The Meltdown]] using Stu's shell as a raft.

Fast Tony's voice is provided by [[Jay Leno]].

===The Lone Gunslinger===

| data4       = Pink
| voice       = [[Will Arnett]]
}}
The Lone Gunslinger is a [[vulture]] who is the secondary antagonist of the film.

The Gunslinger acts as the voice that warns the other animals of the dangers coming soon due to the valley where they reside flooding up with water. The Lone Gunslinger only warns them of the danger and little else, rather hoping that one or two of the animals leaving will die, furnishing food for him and the other vultures which he is presumably family and friends with.

As he watches all of the creatures in the valley leave to safety, he makes snide remarks with his friends about it, and this escalades to the point of singing a musical number on how much they plotted to eat the other animals.

The Lone Gunslinger was last shown flying over the &quot;boat&quot; full of escaping animals and making snide remarks.

In the storybook version, he and his fellow vultures were shown to have ended up feasting on Cretaceous and Maelstrom.

The Lone Gunslinger is voiced by [[Will Arnett]].

===Cretaceous===

}}
Cretaceous is an altered [[metriorhynchus]] and serves as one of the main antagonists of the second film.

Cretaceous is shown in the beginning frozen in a great block of ice that was jarred loose when the wall of ice began crumbling. The ice melted, releasing both Maelstrom and him into the lake which was all but abandoned by most animals. When they made it to the ice lake, the first animal that they had encountered and eaten was Stu the glyptodont, leaving behind only his shell. The two sea reptiles then swam further down the series of rivers where they eventually reached Manny's herd as well as Crash, Eddie, and Ellie. Cretaceous made a great lunge at Manny, but was caught on his tusks, only to be flung far off, hitting a piece of ice and falling back into the water.

Later, when the dam broke, the two reptiles went swimming on the wall of water that was slowly approaching towards the escaping masses and pulled down Manny when he was swimming to save Ellie. Manny devised a plan to rid himself of the two sea reptiles, by having them try to chase him, he tricked them into hitting a log that was wedged under a large rock. The plan worked, freeing Ellie, and the boulder falls on Cretaceous and Maelstrom, killing them. But there is a slight chance that Cretaceous and Maelstrom could come back for the fourth movie Continental Drift.

===Maelstrom===

Maelstrom is an altered [[globidens]] and serves as one of the main antagonists of the second film.

Maelstrom is shown in the beginning frozen in a great block of ice that was jarred loose when the wall of ice began crumbling. The ice melted, releasing both Cretaceous and him into the lake which was all but abandoned by most animals. When they made it to the ice lake, the first animal that they had encountered and eaten was Stu the glyptodont, leaving behind only his shell. The two sea reptiles then swam further down the series of rivers where they eventually reached Manfred's herd as well as Crash, Eddie, and Ellie. Maelstrom intended to eat Sid but could not catch him, as Sid was already escaping with Diego, and had only just escaped Maelstrom as he broke off a massive chunk of ice where the sloth and saber-tooth had stood only moments before.

Later, when the dam broke, the two reptiles went swimming on the wall of water that was slowly approaching towards the escaping masses and pulled down Manny when he was swimming to save Ellie. Manny devised a plan to rid himself of the two sea reptiles, by having them try to chase him, he tricked them into hitting a log that was wedged under a large rock. The plan worked, freeing Ellie and killing Cretaceous and Maelstrom.

A tribe of '''Mini Sloths''' are smaller ground sloths who worship Sid and call him ''Fire King''. Immediately afterwards, they try to throw him into [[lava]]. Sid later escapes. The four main sloths are named Pinky, Misty, Tango, and Eco.

'''Buck''' (short for [[Buckminster]], and long for Buh) is a weasel that makes an appearance in [[Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs]] and was one of the new protagonists in the third film. He is missing his right eye and wears a leaf as an [[impromptu]] [[eyepatch]], and seems slightly insane (he claims that he woke up one day, married to an ugly pineapple, but he still loved it, [http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=24483], and Manny calls him a &quot;deranged hermit&quot;). According to the official website, Buck is one-eyed and relentless in his hunting for dinosaurs. Buck's archenemy is a large albino [[Baryonyx]] he calls Rudy, who gouged out Buck's eye and whose tooth he later sharpened into a knife that he carries with him. Buck claims to have sadly been killed by Rudy, but he lived. In fact, Buck is the only inhabitant of the dinosaurs' world who does not fear Rudy in the slightest, though he possesses a deep respect for him. Due to living underground for so long, he has an extensive knowledge of the dangers of the dinosaur world.

Buck first meets Manny, Crash, Eddie, Diego and Ellie (who he at one point refers to as &quot;preggers&quot;) after they descend into the jungle in pursuit of Sid and Momma, and saves them from a dinosaur attack. He has been living in the jungle for quite some time, persistently hunting Rudy to avenge the loss of his eye, and agrees to lead them to Lava Falls, where Momma has taken Sid, and rescues him after taking control of a [[Pteranodon]].

After Rudy's potential death, Buck, having lost his purpose in life, decides to join the herd and live on the surface. Upon hearing a distant familiar roar that tells him that Rudy survived the fall, he chooses to stay and causes a cave-in that seals off the path between the surface and the underground jungle, trapping him inside and everyone else on the surface. He and Rudy proceed to continue their battle.

Buck and Rudy make a brief cameo in the short film ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]''.

'''Momma''' was a female ''T. Rex'' a one the new protagonists in the third film who took Sid the ground sloth away from his herd when he took her eggs from her. She brings Sid to Lava Falls, and the two compete to see who can care for her babies better. Sid loses, but is allowed to stay. However, they are separated later and Sid is attacked by Rudy. She is also called Momzilla by Sid.

Momma later returns when Manny, Ellie, Diego, Sid, Crash, Eddie, and Buck are under attack by Rudy, and knocks Rudy off of a cliff to his apparent death, proceeding to bid Sid farewell.

'''Rudy''' was a gigantic albino Baryonyx who is feared by all the creatures in the valley except Buck and Momma Tyrannosaur. He served as the main antagonist of the third film even though he is only heard and seen in [[silhouette]] until the very end. When Buck first arrived in the jungle, he was attacked by Rudy, who scratched him in the right eye, thus poking it out, and very nearly devoured him, but Buck escaped, knocking out one of Rudy's teeth in the process. Rudy appears to have held a grudge ever since. (Note: Rudy is constantly mistaken for a [[Suchomimus]] . Although he has features of both species, the filmmakers have directly stated that he is a Baryonyx. He could also be a Spinosaurus losing the sail to evolution.) Rudy first appears when he attacks Sid and chases him onto a rock floating over Lava Falls, and later attacks Sid and company full force as they are about to exit the jungle. The group quickly proves to be no match for the Baryonyx, but are saved by Momma, who knocks him off of a cliff. Rudy survives, however, and he and Buck continue their feud. Rudy is last seen screaming in frustration as Buck is riding on top of the massive dinosaur laughing, as Rudy runs through the jungle.

Rudy and Buck make a brief cameo in the short film ''[[Scrat's Continental Crack-up]]''.

'''Peaches''' is the newborn daughter of [[Manny (Ice Age)#Manny|Manny]] and [[List of Ice Age characters#Ellie|Ellie]], born in the Dinosaur's world whilst they were under attack by a pack of [[wikia:iceage:Guanlong|Guanlong]]. She appeared close to end of the movie and was named after the code-word that was thought up to say that Ellie was going into labour. Manny also claims that [[peaches]] are sweet, round and fuzzy, just like Peaches and Ellie. She looks exactly like her mother, Ellie (which Sid thinks is very lucky). At the end of the film, she returned to the surface with her parents and the rest of the group. She is going to reappear in ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'' as an [[adolescent]].

Johnny's mother demanded that Sid, currently posing as its father/mother figure, order the dinosaur to return her son. Johnny was not found just then; instead a young [[Gastornis]], named Madison, was brought up. But then Manny and Ellie came by. Egbert got scared, and immediately regurgitated Johnny. His mother promptly dragged him off. He was referred to as by Sid and his mother by &quot;Little Johnny&quot;.
