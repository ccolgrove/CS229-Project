Womack wrote and originally recorded [[The Rolling Stones]]' first UK No. 1 hit, &quot;[[It's All Over Now]]&quot; and [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]]'s &quot;[[I Can Understand It]]&quot; among other songs. As a singer he is most notable for the hits &quot;[[Lookin' For a Love]]&quot;, &quot;[[That's The Way I Feel About Cha]]&quot;, &quot;[[Woman's Gotta Have It (song)|Woman's Gotta Have It]]&quot;, &quot;[[Harry Hippie]]&quot;, &quot;[[Across 110th Street]]&quot; and his 1980s hit &quot;[[If You Think You're Lonely Now]]&quot;.

In 2009, Womack was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hREPMeeR5GfDTBELMODMLmXmjLWgD95N3FTO1 The Associated Press: Run-DMC, Metallica lead list of 2009 Rock Hall]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and career; The Valentinos===
Born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], Womack was the third of five boys born to Friendly, Sr. and Naomi Womack in a housing project. Taking after their [[gospel music|gospel]]-singing father, Womack and his four brothers Friendly, Jr., [[Cecil Womack|Cecil]], Harry and Curtis formed The Womack Brothers and began touring the gospel circuit. One night, soul singer [[Sam Cooke]] spotted the Womack Brothers performing and immediately began seeking the group out for a [[recording contract]]. Signing with SAR Records, Cooke's own imprint, they eventually agreed to leave the gospel circuit for a career in [[secular]] music and the group was renamed as the Valentinos. Shortly afterward, they scored their first [[record chart|charted]] [[single (music)|single]], &quot;[[Lookin' For a Love]]&quot;, which peaked at #8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&amp;B chart]]. In 1964, they scored a second hit with &quot;[[It's All Over Now]]&quot;. The latter song was written by Womack and would give the singer monetary royalties after [[The Rolling Stones]]' cover of &quot;It's All Over Now&quot; hit the top of the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The Valentinos' career dwindled after the death of Cooke in December 1964. The group stayed together for a year and a half (recording for [[Chess Records]] in the interim), before splitting up  in 1966. They reformed in the late 1960s and recorded a few songs for Jubilee Records in the early 1970s, appearing on ''Soul Train'' in 1973.  Womack struggled to get noticed in the [[music industry]] and secluded himself as a [[session musician]].

===Early solo career: sideman===
As a session guitarist, Womack worked at [[record producer]] [[Chips Moman]]'s American Studios in Memphis, and played on recordings by [[Joe Tex]] and [[Box Tops|The Box Tops]].  Until this point, around 1967, he had had little success as a solo artist, but at American he began to record a string of hit singles, including 1968's &quot;What Is This&quot; (his first chart hit), &quot;It's Gonna Rain&quot; and &quot;More Than I Can Stand&quot;. During this period he became known as a songwriter, contributing many songs to [[Wilson Pickett]]'s repertoire; these include &quot;[[I'm in Love (Bobby Womack song)|I'm in Love]]&quot; and &quot;I'm a Midnight Mover.&quot; He also applied guitar work on three of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s hit-making late 1960s recordings, including ''[[Lady Soul]]'', where he played guitar on Franklin's hit, &quot;[[Chain of Fools]]&quot;. Among his most well-known works as a session musician from this period, his appearance as guitarist on [[Sly &amp; the Family Stone]]'s 1971 album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]'' and on [[Janis Joplin]]'s ''[[Pearl (album)|Pearl]]'', which features a song by Womack and poet [[Michael McClure]] entitled &quot;Trust Me&quot;. In 1971, on an album with jazz guitarist [[GÃ¡bor SzabÃ³]], he introduced his song &quot;Breezin'&quot;, which later became a hit for [[George Benson]].

===Solo stardom===
In 1968, Womack signed with Minit Records and put out his first charted single, &quot;What Is This&quot;, following that up with &quot;It's Gonna Rain&quot;, &quot;More than I Can Stand&quot;, a soul-infused cover of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; and his [[blues]]y rendition of [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]' &quot;[[California Dreamin']]&quot;, which gave him his first top 50 pop single.

After moving to the [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] [[Record label|label]] in 1971, he released the album ''[[Communication (1972 album)|Communication]]'', scoring the hit &quot;[[That's The Way I Feel About Cha]]&quot;, which became his first [[Top 40]] single in 1972.

His follow-up album, ''Understanding'', featured his original rendition of the single &quot;I Can Understand It&quot;, which later became a funk hit for the [[Detroit]]-based band [[New Birth (band)|New Birth]], and the Top 10 R&amp;B hit, &quot;[[Harry Hippie]]&quot;, loosely based on Womack's late brother Harry, who died two years after the song was recorded. &quot;Harry Hippie&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in Fenruary 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Book of Golden Discs&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In 1973, Womack wrote, produced and recorded the soundtrack album to ''Across 110th Street'', with its title track becoming another successful hit for Womack.

In 1974, Womack's remake of his old 1962 Valentinos single, &quot;[[Lookin' for a Love]]&quot; reached the Top 10 of the pop singles chart. Later hits included the funk singles &quot;Check It Out&quot; and &quot;[[Daylight (Bobby Womack song)|Daylight]]&quot; and the single, &quot;You're Welcome, Stop On By&quot;, later covered by [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] featuring [[Chaka Khan]].

In 1975, Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood wrote his classic second solo album 'Now Look' in collaboration with Womack.

After 1976, few of Womack's songs hit the charts as he dealt with creative difficulties with his record labels. He left United Artists at the end of 1976, and fell out of favor with R&amp;B audiences by the end of the 1970s.

In 1981, he made a comeback with the release of ''[[The Poet (album)|The Poet]]'', which included his Top 10 R&amp;B hit, &quot;[[If You Think You're Lonely Now]]&quot;. Womack gained a sizable European fan base which grew with the release of 1984's ''[[Poet II|The Poet II]]'', which included the top ten R&amp;B duet with [[Patti LaBelle]] titled &quot;Love Has Finally Come at Last&quot;. In 1985, he scored his final Top 10 R&amp;B single with &quot;I Wish He Didn't Trust Me So Much&quot;.

In 1989, Womack sang on Todd Rundgren's &quot;For the Want of a Nail&quot; on the album [[Nearly Human]]. In 1998, he performed [[George Gershwin]]'s &quot;Summertime&quot; with The Roots for the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Red Hot + Rhapsody]]'', a tribute to [[George Gershwin]], which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing [[AIDS]] awareness and fighting the disease.

In 2010, Womack contributed lyrics and sang on &quot;[[Stylo (song)|Stylo]]&quot; alongside [[Mos Def]], the first single from the third [[Gorillaz]] album, ''[[Plastic Beach]]''. Womack was told to sing whatever was on his mind during the recording of &quot;Stylo&quot;. &quot;I was in there for an hour going crazy about love and politics, getting it off my chest&quot;, said Womack.&lt;ref name=&quot;q2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first = Johnny |last = Davis |month = March |year = 2010 |title = Yo Ho Ho |journal = [[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue = 284 |pages = 44â52 |publisher = [[Bauer Media Group]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also provides vocals on the song &quot;Cloud of Unknowing&quot; in addition to the song &quot;Bobby in Phoenix&quot; on their December 2010 release &quot;The Fall&quot;.

==Legacy==
[[Jodeci]]'s [[K-Ci Hailey]], a notable admirer of Womack's work, covered &quot;If You Think You're Lonely Now&quot; in 1994. Hailey again covered Womack in 2006 with his rendition of &quot;A Woman's Gotta Have It&quot;. The song is referenced in [[Mariah Carey]]'s song &quot;[[We Belong Together (Mariah Carey song)|We Belong Together]]&quot;, a number-one hit in June 2005. Carey sings &quot;I can't sleep at night / When you are on my mind / Bobby Womack's on the radio / Singing to me: 'If you think you're lonely now.'&quot;  In 2007, R&amp;B singer [[Jaheim]] interpolated the song as &quot;Lonely&quot; on his album &quot;The Making of a Man&quot;. Neo Soul Singer, Calvin Richardson also covered many of Womack's tunes.

Film director [[Quentin Tarantino]] used &quot;[[Across 110th Street]]&quot; (which, in a different version, had been the title song of [[Across 110th Street|the 1972 movie]]) in the opening and closing sequences of his 1997 film ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]''. His work has been used in several other popular films, including ''[[Meet the Parents]]'' (2000), ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' (2001) and ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'' (2007). A 2003 [[Saab]] commercial used Womack's interpretation of &quot;California Dreamin'&quot;. In 2005,  &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; appeared in the hit [[Activision]] video game ''[[True Crime: New York City]]''. &quot;[[Across 110th Street]]&quot; was used in [[Rockstar Games]] video game ''Thug'z Depression:Live Or Die''.

On the 1994 release [[1-800-NEW-FUNK]], [[Nona Gaye]] covered &quot;[[Woman's Gotta Have It]],&quot; produced by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and backed by his band, [[New Power Generation]].

In 2008, [[Kelly Rowland]] of [[Destiny's Child]] recorded her own version of his R&amp;B hit &quot;[[Daylight (Bobby Womack song)|Daylight]]&quot; with [[Travis McCoy]] of the [[Gym Class Heroes]], which became a hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]], where it was previously released as a single by Womack in 1976.

In 2009, [[Calvin Richardson]] was chosen to record a [[tribute album]] to Womack to coincide with Womack's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The Grammy-nominated album was entitled [[Facts of Life: The Soul of Bobby Womack]].  It reached #30 on the [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums|US R&amp;B chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.billboard.com/#/album/calvin-richardson/facts-of-life-the-soul-of-bobby-womack/1275488 |title=Facts of Life: The Soul of Bobby Womack â Calvin Richardson |work=billboard.com |accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In March 1965, just three months after [[Sam Cooke]]'s death, Womack created scandal by marrying Cooke's widow, Barbara Campbell. Womack claimed he married her for fear that, if she were left alone, she would &quot;do something crazy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/music2/BobbyWomack/bwbiography.html Bobby Womack Angelfire.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://redkelly.blogspot.com/2006/09/bobby-womack-of-valentinos-lonesome.html the &quot;B&quot; side: Bobby Womack of the Valentinos - A Lonesome Man (Checker 1122)]&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1970.

Womack's younger brother, [[Cecil Womack|Cecil]], married Cooke and Campbell's daughter [[Linda Womack|Linda]]. The controversy derailed Womack's career for some time. Womack and Linda collaborated on the hit song &quot;[[Woman's Gotta Have It (song)|Woman's Gotta Have It]]&quot; and he applied background vocals for his brother and Linda as the pair teamed up as [[Womack &amp; Womack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; /&gt;

==Use in film==
Womack's 1968 cover of &quot;[[California Dreamin']]&quot; featured prominently in 2009 British film ''[[Fish Tank (film)|Fish Tank]]'' by [[Andrea Arnold]], where the main character Mia dances to it and uses it as her audition piece. The collection CD on which the song appears also plays a role, and is &quot;The Best of Bobby Womack&quot; (2008), on which &quot;California Dreamin'&quot; appears on track 17, as Mia requests at her audition.

Womack's &quot;[[Across 110th Street (song)|Across 110th Street]]&quot; featured in the opening and elsewhere in the film ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'', directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]].  It is used to emphasise the [[blaxploitation]] tone of the film.  It was used again in the Denzel Washington film, ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]'', which depicted the actual circumstances described in the song.   This song is also used for the closing credits of S2 E3 of TV Show ''[[How to Make It in America]]''.

{{cquote|Record industry people don't understand people who create. They'll say &quot;We've gotta get you a room and a piano and see how many songs you can turn out in a day&quot;.  But it doesn't work like that.  You can't put your feelings on a time schedule.}}
