The '''1948 Maryland Terrapins football team''' represented the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[college football]] in its [[1948 college football season|28th season]] as a member of the [[Southern Conference]]. [[Jim Tatum]] served as the head coach for the second year of his [[Maryland Terrapins football under Jim Tatum (1947â1955)|nine-year tenure]]. The Terrapins compiled a 6â4 record, which proved to be the worst of Tatum's term at Maryland and the only one in which his team lost more than two games. [[Griffith Stadium]] was temporarily used as the home field, as an interim venue between the original [[Old Byrd Stadium|Byrd Stadium]] and the much larger, newly constructed [[Byrd Stadium|stadium of the same name]].&lt;ref name=&quot;umd&quot;&gt;[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/md/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/08guide-11.pdf Year-by-Year Results] (PDF), ''2008 Maryland Football Media Guide'', University of Maryland, 2008.
