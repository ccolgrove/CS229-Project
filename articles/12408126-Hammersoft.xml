'''Troy Anthony Davis''' (October 9, 1968{{ndash}}September 21, 2011)&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis executed&quot;/&gt; was an American man convicted of and executed for the August 19, 1989, murder of police officer Mark MacPhail in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. MacPhail was working as a security guard at a [[Burger King]] restaurant when he intervened to defend a man being assaulted in a nearby parking lot. During Davis's 1991 trial, seven witnesses testified they had seen Davis shoot MacPhail, and two others testified  Davis had confessed the murder to them among 34 witnesses who testified for the prosecution, and six others for the defense, including Davis. Although the murder weapon was not recovered, [[Forensic ballistics|ballistic evidence]] presented at trial linked bullets recovered at or near the scene to those at another shooting in which Davis was also charged. He was convicted of murder and various lesser charges, including the earlier shooting, and was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in August 1991.

Davis maintained his innocence until his execution. In the 20 years between his conviction and execution, Davis and his defenders secured support from the public, celebrities, and human rights groups. [[Amnesty International]] and other groups such as [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] took up Davis's cause. Prominent politicians and leaders, including former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]], Rev. [[Al Sharpton]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]], former U.S. Congressman from Georgia and presidential candidate [[Bob Barr]], and former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Director and judge [[William S. Sessions]] called upon the courts to grant Davis a new trial or evidentiary hearing. In July 2007, September 2008, and October 2008, execution dates were scheduled, but each execution was [[Stay of execution|stayed]] shortly before it was to take place.

In 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ordered the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia]] to consider whether new evidence &quot;that could not have been obtained at the time of trial clearly establishes [Davis's] innocence&quot;. The evidentiary hearing was held in June 2010. The defense presented affidavits from seven of the nine trial witnesses whose original testimony had identified Davis as the murderer, but who it contended had changed or recanted their previous testimony. Some of these writings disavowed parts of prior testimony, or implicated Sylvester &quot;Redd&quot; Coles, whom Davis contended was the actual triggerman. The state presented witnesses, including the police investigators and original prosecutors, who described a careful investigation of the crime, without any coercion. Davis did not call some of the witnesses who had supposedly recanted, despite their presence in the courthouse; accordingly their affidavits were given little weight by the judge. Evidence that Coles had confessed to the killing was excluded as [[hearsay]] because Coles was not subpoenaed by the defense to rebut it.

In an August 2010 decision, the conviction was upheld. The court described defense efforts to upset the conviction as &quot;largely smoke and mirrors&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SS1&quot; /&gt; and found that several of the proffered affidavits were not recantations at all. Subsequent appeals, including to the Supreme Court, were rejected, and a fourth execution date was set for September 21, 2011. Nearly one million people signed petitions urging the [[Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles]] to grant clemency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Not In Our Name: Georgia Must Not Execute Troy Davis&quot;/&gt; The Board denied clemency&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia Board Denies Clemency for Troy Davis&quot;/&gt; and, on September 21, it refused to reconsider its decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;state&quot;/&gt; After a last minute appeal to the United States Supreme Court was denied, the sentence was carried out through [[lethal injection]] on September 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Davis Executed After Stay Denied&quot;/&gt;

==Events of August 18-23, 1989==

The charges against Troy Davis arose from the shooting of Michael Cooper, the beating of Larry Young and the murder of Officer Mark MacPhail on August 18-19, 1989. 

On the evening of August 18, 1989, Davis attended a pool party in the Cloverdale neighborhood of [[Savannah, Georgia]]. As he left the party with his friend Daryl Collins, the occupants of a passing car yelled obscenities. A bullet was fired at the car&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc111107&quot;/&gt; and Michael Cooper, a passenger, was struck in the jaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn230891&quot;/&gt; Davis and Collins then went to a pool hall on Oglethorpe Avenue in the Yamacraw Village section of Savannah.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn270891b&quot;/&gt;

Later that evening, Davis and Collins proceeded to the parking lot of a [[Burger King]] restaurant on Oglethorpe Avenue, not far from the pool hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn270891b&quot;/&gt; There they encountered Sylvester &quot;Redd&quot; Coles arguing with a [[Homelessness|homeless]] man, Larry Young, over alcohol.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc111107&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;homeless&quot; /&gt; 

At about 1:15 am on August 19, 1989, Mark MacPhail, an off-duty police officer working as a security guard, attempted to intervene in the [[pistol-whipping]] of Young at the parking lot.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn050810&quot;/&gt; MacPhail was shot twice: once through the heart and once in the face. He did not draw his gun.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc111107&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;homeless&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn290891&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn010590&quot;/&gt; Bullets and shell casings which were determined to have come from a .38-caliber pistol were retrieved from the crime scene. Witnesses to the shooting agreed that a man in a white shirt had struck Young and then shot MacPhail.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc111107&quot;/&gt;

On August 19, Coles told Savannah Police he had seen Davis with a .38-caliber gun, and that Davis had assaulted Young.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc111107&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sep240889&quot;/&gt; The same evening, Davis drove to [[Atlanta]] with his sister.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc111107&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sep240889&quot;/&gt; In the early morning of August 20, 1989, Savannah Police searched the Davis home and seized a pair of Davis's shorts which were found in a clothes dryer.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn101190&quot;/&gt; Davis's family began negotiating with police, motivated by concerns about his safety; local drug dealers were making death threats because the police dragnet seeking Davis had disrupted their business.&lt;ref name=&quot;sep240889&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn250889&quot;/&gt; On August 23, 1989, Davis returned to Savannah, surrendered himself to police and was charged with MacPhail's murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;sep240889&quot;/&gt;

===Background of Mark MacPhail===

Mark Allen MacPhail, Sr was 27 years old at the time of his murder. He was the son of a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] colonel, was married, and was father to a two-year-old daughter and an infant son. 

MacPhail had joined the Savannah Police Department in 1986 following six years of military service as an [[United States Army Rangers|Army Ranger]]. MacPhail had worked for three years as a regular patrol officer and in the summer of 1989 had applied to train as a mounted policeman.&lt;ref name=&quot;marks&quot;/&gt; 

Hundreds of mourners, including county, state, and federal law enforcement officers, attended MacPhail's funeral at Trinity Lutheran Church in Savannah on August 22, 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hundreds mourn officer&quot;/&gt;

===Background of Troy Davis===

Davis was the eldest child of [[Korean War]] veteran Joseph Davis and hospital worker Virginia Davis.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn310891&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn240889&quot;/&gt; The couple divorced when Davis was very young,&lt;ref name=&quot;smn240889&quot;/&gt; and Davis grew up with four siblings in the predominantly [[black middle class|black, middle-class]] neighborhood of Cloverdale in [[Savannah, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smn240889&quot;/&gt;

Davis attended [[Windsor Forest High School]], where one teacher described him as a poor student.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn240889&quot;/&gt; He dropped out in his junior year so he could drive his disabled younger sister to her rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn310891&quot;/&gt; Davis obtained his high-school equivalency diploma from Richard Arnold Education Center in 1987. A teacher noted that he attended school regularly but seemed to lack discipline.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn310891&quot;/&gt; Davis's nickname at the time was &quot;Rah,&quot; or &quot;Rough as Hell&quot;, but some neighbors reported that it did not reflect his behavior; they described him as a &quot;straight-up fellow&quot; who acted as a big brother to local children.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn240889&quot;/&gt; 

In July 1988, Davis pleaded guilty to [[concealed carry in the United States|carrying a concealed weapon]]; he was fined $250 as part of a plea agreement in which a charge of possession of a gun with altered serial numbers was dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Officers link suspect to another shooting&quot;/&gt;

In August 1988, Davis began work as a drill technician at a plant which manufactured railroad crossing gates. His boss once commented that while Davis was a likeable and good worker who appeared to have positive life goals, his job attendance was poor and by Christmas 1988 he had stopped coming to work.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn310891&quot;/&gt; Davis returned to the job twice in the following months but neither time remained for long.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn310891&quot; /&gt;

Davis was a coach in the Savannah Police Athletic League and had signed up for service in the [[United States Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowe&quot; /&gt;

==Trial and conviction==

===Pre-trial proceedings===

On November 15, 1989, a [[grand jury]] indicted Davis for murder, assaulting Larry Young with a pistol, shooting Michael Cooper, obstructing MacPhail in performance of his duty and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;sep161189&quot;/&gt; Davis pleaded not guilty in April 1990.&lt;ref name=smn010590/&gt; 

In November 1990, the presiding judge excluded [[Forensic identification|forensic evidence]] from the pair of shorts seized at the Davis home. The judge ruled that Davis's mother did &quot;not freely and voluntarily grant the police the right to search her home&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn101190&quot; /&gt; She had testified that police officers had threatened to break down her door unless she let them into her home. The [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] upheld the exclusion of the evidence in May 1991, saying that the police should have obtained a search warrant.&lt;ref name=&quot;sep161189&quot; /&gt;

Davis was brought to trial in August 1991.

===Prosecution case===

The prosecution claimed that Davis had shot Cooper in Cloverdale, then met up with Redd Coles at a pool hall, pistol-whipped the homeless man Larry Young in the parking lot and then killed Mark MacPhail.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn230891&quot;/&gt; 

The prosecution called three eyewitnesses to the shooting of Cooper:

* Cooper testified that he was intoxicated at the time he was shot, and that although Davis was one of the people Cooper had quarrelled with, he &quot;don't know me well enough to shoot me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn270891b&quot; /&gt; 

* Benjamin Gordon stated that the man who had shot Cooper had been wearing a white Batman T-shirt and blue shorts. On cross-examination Gordon admitted he had not seen the person who shot Cooper and stated that he did not know Davis.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn270891b&quot; /&gt; 

* Daryl Collins had made a statement to police on August 19, 1989 that he had seen Davis shoot at the car in which Cooper was travelling. However, on cross-examination at trial, Collins denied having seen Davis carrying or shooting a gun on the night in question. Collins, who was 16 at the time he made the initial statement, claimed police officers had told him he would be imprisoned if he refused to co-operate with the investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn270891b&quot; /&gt;

The prosecution called a number of eyewitnesses to MacPhail's murder:

* Larry Young and Antoine Williams testified that Davis, wearing a white shirt, had struck Young and then shot MacPhail.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn140891&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn260891&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=smn270891b/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aireport2007&quot;/&gt; 

* Harriet Murray and Dorothy Ferrell testified that Davis, wearing a white shirt, had struck Young and shot MacPhail. They testified Davis shot MacPhail again after he fell to the ground wounded.&lt;ref name=&quot;savannah08241991&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn270891b&quot; /&gt;  

* Coles testified that Davis, wearing a white shirt, had shot MacPhail. Coles admitted arguing with Young but claimed it was Davis who had hit him with a pistol.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc121107&quot;/&gt;  On [[cross-examination]], Coles admitted that he owned a .38-caliber pistol but testified he had given it to another man earlier on the night in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn140891&quot; /&gt; 

* [[United States Air Force|Air force]] personnel Robert Grizzard and Steven Sanders were also called by the prosecution. Sanders identified Davis as MacPhail's murderer while Grizzard stated he could not identify the gunman.&lt;ref name=&quot;aireport2007&quot; /&gt; 

* Daryl Collins had claimed in a police statement to have seen Davis approach MacPhail; however, as with the Cooper shooting claims (above), Collins retracted the statement on cross-examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn270891b&quot; /&gt;  

Two witnesses to whom Davis was claimed to have confessed were called at trial:

* Jeffrey Sapp was a neighbor of the Davis family. He testified that Davis confessed to him soon after the murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc121107&quot; /&gt; 

* Kevin McQueen was an acquaintance of Davis who had been held at Chatham County Jail at the same time as Davis. McQueen claimed that Davis had admitted to being involved in the &quot;exchange of gunfire&quot; in which Cooper was shot and to have shot MacPhail because he was &quot;paranoid...they'd seen him that night in Cloverdale&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn270891a&quot;/&gt;  

In total, thirty four witnesses testified at trial for the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

The prosecution did not produce a weapon (neither the gun which Davis was said to have used nor the gun owned by Coles) as evidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc121107&quot; /&gt; A ballistics expert testified that the .38 caliber bullet that killed MacPhail could have been fired from the same gun that wounded Cooper. He also stated that he was confident that .38 casings found at Cloverdale matched bullet casings found near the scene of MacPhail's shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;aireport2007&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Davis's attorneys file last-ditch court appeal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New Execution Date Set For Troy Anthony Davis Who Was Convicted Of 1989 Murder Of Savannah Police Officer Mark McPhail&quot; /&gt;

===Defense case===

Davis denied shooting Cooper and denied shooting MacPhail. Davis testified to having seen Coles assault Young and Davis said that he had  fled the scene before any shots were fired and, therefore, did not know who had shot MacPhail.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn280891&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn150991&quot; /&gt;

===Verdict and sentencing===

On August 28, 1991, the jury took under two hours to find Davis guilty of murder, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and obstruction of a law enforcement officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn290891&quot; /&gt; 

The prosecution sought the death penalty during sentencing proceedings for the murder conviction. Davis and three of his family members testified on Davis's behalf. In a final address to the jury, Davis pleaded, &quot;Spare my life. Just give me a second chance. That's all I ask.&quot; He told jurors he was convicted for &quot;offenses I didn't commit.&quot; MacPhail's family members and friends were not allowed to testify.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn300891a&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn300891b&quot; /&gt; On August 30, 1991, after seven hours of deliberation, the jury recommended the death penalty and Davis was sentenced to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn310891&quot; /&gt;

==Appeals and challenges to conviction and sentence==

===First appellate proceedings===

Since the death penalty was imposed, both the conviction and sentence were automatically appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn021091&quot;/&gt; Davis and his lawyers requested a new trial, citing problems with the trial site and selection of the jury.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn190292&quot; /&gt; The request was denied in March 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis Conviction Upheld&quot; /&gt; In March 1993, the Georgia Supreme Court also upheld Davis's conviction and sentence, ruling that the judge had correctly refused to change trial site and that the racial composition of the jury did not deny his rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia High Court Upholds Sentence&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;appeal of conviction&quot; /&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declined to hear an appeal in November 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Death Row Inmate Won't Get Appeal&quot;/&gt; Direct appeals having been exhausted, in March 1994 an order was signed for Davis's execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Convicted Killer's Execution Order Signed&quot; /&gt;

===First habeas corpus proceedings===

In 1994, Davis began [[habeas corpus]] proceedings, filing a petition in state court alleging that he had been wrongfully convicted and that his death sentence was a miscarriage of justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;aireport2007&quot; /&gt; The following year, the federal funding of the Georgia Resource Center, which helped represent Davis, was cut by 70%, leading to the departures of most of the center's lawyers and investigators. According to a later affidavit by the Executive Director the &quot;work conducted on Mr. Davis's case was akin to triage... There were numerous witnesses that we knew should have been interviewed, but lacked the resources to do so.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 07-13-07&quot; /&gt; The appeal stated that the testimony of the prosecution witnesses had been coerced by law enforcement personnel. The petition was denied in September 1997, with the court ruling that claims of improper law enforcement approaches should have been raised earlier in the appeal process, and the court could not usurp the jury's role to evaluate the evidence offered during the trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;state habeas 1997&quot; /&gt; The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the denial of state habeas corpus relief on November 13, 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;state habeas&quot; /&gt;

In 2000 Davis challenged his conviction in state court. He alleged that the use of the [[electric chair]] during executions in Georgia constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia Court Hears Case Testing Use Of Electric Chair&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpressrelease&quot; /&gt; By a 4â3 margin the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the challenge, stating once again that Davis should have raised the issue earlier in the appeal process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debate On Electric Chair Will Continue&quot; /&gt;

===Federal appeals===

In December 2001, Davis filed a [[habeas corpus]] petition in the United States District Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpressrelease&quot; /&gt; From 1996 onwards, seven of the nine principal prosecution eyewitnesses changed all or part of their trial testimony.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Long Road To The Davis Case - CBS News&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian290609&quot; /&gt; Dorothy Ferrell, for example, stated in a 2000 affidavit that she felt under pressure from police to identify Davis as the shooter because she was on parole for a shoplifting conviction.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian290609&quot;/&gt; In a 2002 affidavit, Darrell Collins wrote that the police had scared him into falsely testifying by threatening to charge him as an accessory to the crime, and alleged that he had not seen Davis do anything to Young.&lt;ref name=&quot;wp160707&quot; /&gt; Antoine Williams, Larry Young and Monty Holmes also stated in affidavits that their earlier testimony implicating Davis had been coerced by strong-arm police tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;aireport2007&quot; /&gt; In addition, three witnesses signed affidavits stating that Red Coles had confessed to the murder to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc121107&quot; /&gt;

The State of Georgia argued that the evidence had been [[Procedural default|procedurally defaulted]] since it should have been introduced earlier. Davis's petition was denied in May 2004; the judge stated in an opinion that the &quot;submitted affidavits are insufficient to raise doubts as to the constitutionality of the result at trial, there is no danger of a miscarriage of justice in declining to consider the claim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpressrelease&quot;/&gt; He also rejected other defense contentions about unfair jury selection, ineffective defense counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. The decision was appealed to the 11th Circuit Court, which heard oral arguments in the case in September 2005. On September 26, 2006, the court affirmed the denial of federal habeas corpus relief, and determined that Davis had not made &quot;a substantive claim of actual innocence&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpressrelease&quot; /&gt; or shown that his trial was constitutionally unfair; the circuit court found that neither prosecutors nor defense counsel had acted improperly or incompetently at trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;11th circuit 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eckenrode&quot; /&gt; A petition for panel rehearing was denied in December 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpressrelease&quot; /&gt;

Legal experts argued that a major obstacle to granting Davis a new trial was the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]], passed after the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], which bars death row inmates from later presenting evidence they could have presented at trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;SS1&quot; /&gt; Members of the legal community have criticized the restricting effect of the 1996 Act on the ability of wrongfully convicted persons to prove their innocence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 07-13-07&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wp160707&quot; /&gt;

===First execution date===

On June 25, 2007, Davis's first [[Certiorari#United States law|certiorari]] petition to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied,&lt;ref name=dolpressrelease/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;certiorari 1&quot;/&gt; and his execution was then set for July 17, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 07-13-07&quot;/&gt;

Davis's case gained increasing public exposure and support from organizations and prominent individuals. [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner [[Desmond Tutu|Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] urged the courts to agree to hear the evidence of police coercion and recanted testimony.&lt;ref name=&quot;tutu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=tvnz/&gt; An appeal to [[Governor of Georgia]] [[Sonny Perdue]] urging him to spare Davis's life was sent on behalf of [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope makes plea to spare life of Troy Davis&quot;/&gt; Similar appeals were sent by singer [[Harry Belafonte]],&lt;ref name=&quot;belafonte&quot;/&gt; Sister [[Helen Prejean]], author of ''[[Dead Man Walking (book)|Dead Man Walking]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;prejean&quot;/&gt; and actor [[Mike Farrell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope's message for Perdue: Don't execute killer&quot;/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] published a report about Davis's case characterizing it as a miscarriage of justice and a &quot;catastrophic flaw in the U.S. death penalty machine.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty pr 06-25-2007&quot;/&gt; The human rights group initiated a letter-writing campaign and delivered 4,000 letters to the clemency board.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clemency board receives letters supporting Davis&quot;/&gt; [[William S.

Millsap, Jr., and the organization Murder Victims Families for Reconciliation requested that the courts grant Davis a new trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty pr 07-10-07&quot;/&gt; [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]] spoke to the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, suggesting that Coles â one of the witnesses who had not recanted â was the real killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt; Representatives from the [[Council of Europe]] and [[European Parliament]] also spoke out on Davis's case, asking U.S. authorities to halt the planned execution and calling for a new trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;carrier&quot; /&gt;

On July 16, 2007, the [[Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles]] granted a ninety-day [[stay of execution]] in order to allow the evaluation of evidence presented, including the doubts about Davis's guilt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis wins 90-day stay of execution&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stay of Execution for Georgia Man&quot; /&gt; The stay was superseded by the August 2007 decision of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] to grant Davisâ application for [[Discretionary jurisdiction|discretionary appeal]] from the denial of his Extraordinary Motion for a New Trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parole board bows out of Davis clemency bid&quot;/&gt; Defense lawyers requested a new trial based on statements of mistaken identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Death Row Inmate Looks For New Trial&quot;/&gt; On March 17, 2008, the Georgia Supreme Court denied the appeal by a 4â3 majority. The majority wrote that the recanting witnesses &quot;have merely stated they now do not feel able to identify the shooter&quot;, that the trial testimony could not be ignored, and that they &quot;in fact, favor[ed] that original testimony over the new.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SCGA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc170308&quot; /&gt; In dissent, the Chief Justice wrote that &quot;if recantation testimony, either alone or supported by other evidence, shows convincingly that prior trial testimony was false, it simply defies all logic and morality to hold that it must be disregarded categorically&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc170308&quot; /&gt;

===Second execution date===

In July 2008, Davis's lawyers filed a [[Certiorari#United States law|petition for a writ of certiorari]] in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Georgia Supreme Court decision and arguing that the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] creates a substantive right of the innocent not to be executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;cert petition&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt151008&quot; /&gt; However, an execution date was scheduled for September 23, 2008, before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decided whether to take up Davis's case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Execution set for Davis in killing of policeman&quot;/&gt; The Georgia Supreme Court refused to grant a stay of execution and the Board of Pardons and Paroles denied clemency.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn 09-13-08&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc220908&quot;/&gt; [[File:Troy Davis Paris demo.jpg|Demonstration in support of Troy Davis, Paris, July 2008|thumb|left]] [[Amnesty International]] condemned the decision to deny clemency,&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty pr clemency&quot;/&gt; and former President (and Georgia Governor) [[Jimmy Carter]] released a public letter in which he stated &quot;Executing Troy Davis without a real examination of potentially exonerating evidence risks taking the life of an innocent man and would be a grave miscarriage of justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;carter pr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Death row inmate's life awaits ruling&quot;/&gt; Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] also called for clemency after he met and prayed with Davis on death row.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharpton seeks clemency for Troy Anthony Davis&quot;/&gt; A stay of execution was also supported by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]; the president of the Georgia state conference said &quot;This is a modern-day lynching if it's allowed to go forward.&quot;&lt;ref name=ajc220908/&gt; Former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] presidential candidate [[Bob Barr]] wrote that he is &quot;a strong believer in the death penalty as an appropriate and just punishment,&quot; but that the proper level of fairness and accuracy required for the ultimate punishment has not been met in Davis's case.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr, Carter both seek clemency for Troy Davis&quot; /&gt;

A last minute emergency stay, issued by the Supreme Court less than two hours before Davis was scheduled to be put to death, halted the execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty pr 9-24-08&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;US Supreme Court Awards Convicted Murderer Troy Davis Late Stay Of Execution In Jackson, Georgia&quot;/&gt; Lawyers for Davis argued that lower courts had failed to permit a hearing to carefully examine the recanted testimony and four witnesses who implicated Coles. Lawyers for the Georgia attorney general's office argued that most of the affidavits had already been presented and reviewed, and that questions about the quality and credibility of the witnesses were raised at the initial trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Court declines to hear death-row appeal&quot; /&gt;

On October 14, 2008, the Supreme Court declined to hear Davis's petition,&lt;ref name=nyt151008/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Docket for 08-66&quot; /&gt; and a new execution date was set for October 27, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;wtoc270809&quot; /&gt;

===Third execution date===

On October 21, 2008, Davis's lawyers requested an emergency stay of the pending execution, and three days later the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay of execution to consider a newly-filed federal habeas petition.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc241008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc231008&quot;/&gt; Davis's supporters continued their appeals and actions; these included rallies held worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rallies protest impending execution of Troy Davis&quot;/&gt; a petition with 140,000 signatures presented to the state Board of Pardons and Paroles,&lt;ref name=ajc241008/&gt; and an appeal from the European Union calling for the death sentence to be commuted.&lt;ref name = &quot;ajc231008&quot;/&gt; In contrast, the [[Chatham County, Georgia|Chatham County]] prosecutors asserted that Davis was guilty and deserved the death penalty.&lt;ref name=ajc241008/&gt;
[[File:NLN M1 Dead Prez.jpg| Rapper [[M-1 (rapper)|M1]] speaks at a rally held in 2009 in New York City in support of Troy Davis|thumb|right]]
Oral arguments were heard by a three-judge panel on December 9 in [[Atlanta]]. Davis's lawyers again argued that [[exculpatory evidence|exculpatory]] affidavits proving Davis innocent had not been examined in a court of law; they noted the witnesses who had implicated Coles, and that his photo was not included among those shown to witnesses in the case.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc 12-10-08&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn101208&quot;/&gt; The Senior Assistant Attorney General argued that, in extraordinary cases, evidence of wrongful conviction could be heard at this stage of the appeals process, but that in this case the recantation evidence was untrustworthy, and are generally regarded with the &quot;highest suspicion.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;ajc 12-10-08&quot;/&gt; Multiple courts and boards had also previously declined appeals.&lt;ref name = &quot;ajc 12-10-08&quot;/&gt; During the hearing, judge [[Joel Fredrick Dubina|Joel Dubina]] commented: &quot;As bad as it would be to execute an innocent man, it's also possible the real guilty person who shot Officer MacPhail is not being prosecuted.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;ajc 12-10-08&quot;/&gt; Another judge, [[Stanley Marcus (judge)|Stanley Marcus]], noted that two of the witnesses had not changed their recollections,&lt;ref name=smn101208/&gt; and that no [[DNA]] was available to categorically clear Davis.&lt;ref name = &quot;ajc 12-10-08&quot;/&gt; After the hearing, Davis's sister, Martina Correia, an active campaigner for her brother stated &quot;This is not family against family. We have no ill will against the MacPhail family. When justice is found for Troy, there will be justice for Officer MacPhail.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;APN 12-09-08&quot;/&gt;

On April 16, 2009, the panel denied Davis's application by a 2â1 majority. Judges Dubina and Marcus rejected the petition, stating that Davis's claims having been reviewed and rejected in the past, and that the recantations were not persuasive.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn17042008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;11th circuit opinion 2&quot;/&gt; Judge [[Rosemary Barkett]], in dissent, expressed her belief that as Davis might prove his innocence, it would be wrong to execute him.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn17042008&quot;/&gt; In an interview, Mark MacPhail Jr. said of his father, &quot;He gave his life for the community and now I'm trying to help out his name and help him in some way.&quot; Of the appeals process, he says, &quot;The past two years we've had countless appeals and it just keeps on getting drug out.&quot; Of Davis, MacPhail said, &quot;He decided to break the law. And our law says, you kill an officer of the law, who tries to uphold it, you must be punished.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacPhail's son speaks on Davis appeal denial&quot;/&gt; The 11th Circuit issued an order extending the stay of execution for 30 days to allow Davis the opportunity to file a habeas corpus petition with the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn17042008&quot;/&gt; Davis filed a petition for [[habeas corpus]] with the U.S. Supreme Court on May 19, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsav&quot; /&gt;

On August 17, 2009, the Supreme Court ordered the Savannah federal district court to &quot;receive testimony and make findings of fact as to whether evidence that could not have been obtained at the time of trial clearly establishes [Davis'] innocence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SupCtNo08-1443&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;csm240810&quot;/&gt; Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], joined by Justices [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] and [[Stephen Breyer]], wrote that &quot;[t]he substantial risk of putting an innocent man to death clearly provides an adequate justification for holding an evidentiary hearing.&quot; Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] dissented, stating that a new hearing would be &quot;a fool's errand&quot; because Davis's claim of innocence was &quot;a sure loser&quot;. He was joined by Justice [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc23062010&quot;/&gt;

===Federal hearing===

In response to the Supreme Court order, a two-day hearing was held in June 2010 in a federal district court in Savannah in front of Judge [[William Theodore Moore Jr.|William Moore]].&lt;ref name=ajc23062010/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc24062010&quot;/&gt; Former prosecution witness Antoine Williams stated he did not know who had shot MacPhail, and that because he was illiterate he could not read the police statements he had signed in 1989.&lt;ref name=smn240610/&gt; Other prosecution witnesses Jeffrey Sapp and Kevin MacQueen testified that Davis had not confessed to them as they had stated at the initial trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc23062010b&quot;/&gt; Darrell Collins also recanted his previous evidence that he had seen Davis shoot Cooper and MacPhail.&lt;ref name=smn240610/&gt; The witnesses variously described their previous testimony against Davis as being the result of feeling scared, of feeling frightened and pressured by police or to get revenge in a conflict with Davis.&lt;ref name=&quot;smn240610&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc23062010b&quot; /&gt; Anthony Hargrove testified that Redd Coles had admitted the killing to him. The state's lawyers described Hargrove's testimony as [[hearsay]] evidence; Judge William T. Moore permitted the evidence but stated that unless Coles appeared, he might give the evidence &quot;no weight whatsoever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;smn240610&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc23062010b&quot; /&gt; Another witness making a similar statement was heard, but a third was rejected by Judge Moore as the claims were inadmissible hearsay because Coles was not called as a witness and given the opportunity for rebuttal.&lt;ref name=ajc24062010/&gt;&lt;ref name=smn220710 /&gt; Moore criticized the decision not to call Coles, saying that he was &quot;one of the most critical witnesses to Davis's defense&quot;. One of Davis's lawyers stated that the day before they had been unsuccessful in serving a subpoena on Coles; Moore responded that the attempt had been made too late, given that the hearing had been set for months.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc24062010&quot; /&gt;

State attorneys called current and former police officers and the two lead prosecutors, who testified that the investigation had been careful, and that no witnesses had been coerced or threatened.&lt;ref name=ajc24062010/&gt; The lead detective testified that his investigation was &quot;very meticulous and carefulâ¦ I was in no rush just to pick the first guy we got our hands on. I wanted the right guy.&quot;&lt;ref name=ajc23062010b/&gt; He stated that witnesses gave &quot;strikingly similar descriptions on how the shooter was dressed,&quot; mostly describing the shooter as wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, which other witnesses said Davis was wearing that evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc23062010b&quot;/&gt; A state attorney asserted that the testimony of at least five prosecution witnesses remained unchallenged, and the evidence of Davis's guilt was overwhelming.&lt;ref name=ajc24062010/&gt; In July 2010, Davis's lawyers filed a motion asking Moore to reconsider his decision to exclude testimony from a witness to a confession by Coles,&lt;ref name=&quot;smn220710&quot;/&gt; but in August 2010, Moore stood by his initial decision, stating that in not calling Coles, Davis's lawyers were seeking to implicate Coles without desiring his rebuttal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judge stands by decision to exclude testimony in Troy Davis case&quot; /&gt;

Moore ruled that executing an innocent person would violate the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]. &quot;However, Mr. Davis is not innocent.&quot;&lt;ref name =csm240810/&gt; In his decision, Moore wrote: &quot;while Mr. Davis's new evidence casts some additional, minimal doubt on his conviction, it is largely smoke and mirrors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;csm240810&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SS1&quot; /&gt; Of the seven papers described as recantations by the defense, Moore found that only one was wholly credible and two were partly credible.&lt;ref name=csm240810/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajc240810/&gt; He did not consider Coles' alleged confessions because of the failure of Davis's lawyers to subpoena Coles, and suggested that Davis should appeal directly to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc240810&quot; /&gt; In November 2010, the federal appeals panel dismissed an appeal on the case, without ruling on its merits. They stated that Davis should appeal the case directly to the U.S. Supreme Court &quot;because he had exhausted his other avenues of relief.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Appeal dismissed for death row inmate Troy Davis&quot; /&gt; [[Rosemary Barkett]], one of the panel judges, later released a statement saying that although she agreed with the decision, she still believed that Davis should be given a new trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;US court denies latest appeal by death row inmate&quot; /&gt;

===Renewed U.S. Supreme Court petition===
[[File:Troy Davis Execution Protest 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|A man protesting the September 21 execution date at the September 17 [[Occupy Wall Street]] rally]]

In January 2011, Davis's legal team filed a new petition with the United States Supreme Court, alleging that the 11th Circuit panel had &quot;evinced a clear hostility&quot; during his August 2010 appeal, and again asking for a new trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Davis files new appeal with U.S. Supreme Court&quot;/&gt; The petition was rejected without comment by the Supreme Court in March 2011, allowing a new execution date.&lt;ref name=&quot;liptak&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Supreme Court declines case of death-row inmate who became cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre&quot;/&gt;

In May 2011, [[Amnesty International]] and [[People of Faith Against the Death Penalty]] asked religious leaders to sign a petition to the [[Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles]] calling for the commutation of Davis's death sentence. By September 17, 2011, over 660,000 people&lt;ref name=&quot;More than 600,000 sign petition against planned execution of Troy Davis&quot;/&gt; had signed the petition for clemency including [[Pope Benedict XVI]], Archbishop of Atlanta [[Wilton Gregory]], [[William S.

John Lewis and Hank Johnson Urge Clemency For Inmate Troy Anthony Davis&quot;/&gt;

In contrast, law enforcement officials such as Spencer Lawton, the former Chatham County prosecutor who put Davis on trial, remained convinced of the evidence for Davis's guilt and that Davis's supporters &quot;would know differently if they looked at the record.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prosecutor says he has no doubt about Troy Davis's guilt&quot; /&gt; He stated: &quot;We have consistently won the case as it has been presented in court.

==Execution of Troy Davis==

On September 7, 2011, Georgia set Davis's execution date for September 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia sets Sept. 21 execution for Troy Davis&quot;/&gt; The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles set a hearing for Davis's second bid for clemency for September 19. The Board did not grant him clemency in September 2008, but the five-member Board had three new members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Anthony Davis's execution set for Sept. 21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parole board to again hear Troy Anthony Davis case&quot;/&gt; On September 20, the Board denied him clemency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Board denies clemency for Troy Davis&quot;/&gt;

On the morning of September 21, 2011, the [[Butts County, Georgia|Butts County]] Superior Court denied Davis's request to halt his execution. The Georgia Supreme Court also denied his appeal. Davis was set to be executed at 7&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ga high court rejects plea to stop Davis execution&quot;/&gt; The same night, White House Press Secretary [[Jay Carney]] announced that President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] would not intervene in the case (while Obama could not have pardoned Davis, he had the authority to order a federal investigation that might have led to a delay in the execution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/09/21/obama-wont-act-in-troy-davis-execution-case/|title=Obama wonât act in Troy Davis execution case|date=September 21, 2011|accessdate=October 18, 2011|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=[[The Raw Story]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis filed a request with the U.S. Supreme Court to [[stay of execution|stay his execution]]. Almost an hour after Davis's scheduled execution time, the Supreme Court announced they would review his petition, thereby postponing his scheduled execution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Last-Ditch Appeals Stalls Georgia Execution&quot;/&gt; The Supreme Court, however, denied Davis's petition, after deliberating for several hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Davis Execution Stay Denied&quot;/&gt;

The execution began at 10:53&amp;nbsp;pm EDT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia executes Troy Davis after his last pleas fail&quot;/&gt; In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:&lt;ref name=&quot;Troy Davis maintains innocence in final words&quot;/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation -- I know all of you are still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am -- sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Troy Davis' Last Words Released by Georgia Department of Corrections (AUDIO)|date=October 7, 2011|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/07/troy-davis-execution-last-words_n_1000648.html|accessdate=October 18, 2011|author=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
