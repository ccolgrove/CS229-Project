It was previously known as '''[[Fox Kids]]'''.
This TV channel was available in Slovenia from 06:00-19:00 from a cable operator Telemach.

&lt;!--After the rebranding, the channel will divide into many tv channels : Disney Channel : [[Bulgaria]],[[Croatia]],[[Estonia]],[[Kazahstan]],[[Romania]],[[Russia]] and [[Serbia]].
[[Disney Channel Romania]] will air in Romania and [[Moldova]].--&gt;
on May 2010 Disney channel Romania was removed from [[Hot Bird]] satellite .Advertising is shown in Romanian and Bulgarian; the voices in the ads are only heard on the respective audio tracks.  At the commercial break ident it shows just the Romanian word for &quot;commercials&quot;:&quot;RECLAME&quot;, unlike on the Central Europe version of Disney Channel, where it shows first:&quot;REKLAMA&quot;, then&quot;REKLÃM&quot;. Before rebranding, it was showing &quot;RECLAME&quot;, then &quot;Ð ÐÐÐÐÐÐ&quot; on Jetix.
