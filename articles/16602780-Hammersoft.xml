Although independent observers credit the government with respecting freedom of the press in general, the government has been criticized for failing to investigate thoroughly summary killings of [[journalists]] and for subjecting journalists to harassment and surveillance. The most widely read newspapers are the [[Manila Bulletin]], [[The Philippine Star]], [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]], [[The Manila Times]], and [[BusinessWorld]]. 

==Growth==

In 2004 the country had '''225 television stations''', '''369 AM radio broadcast stations''', '''583 FM radio broadcast stations''', '''10 internet radio stations''' and '''5''' '''[[shortwave]]''' '''stations'''. Although some media outlets, such as [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]] (television) and the [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] (radio), are government-run, most outlets are privately owned. Much media ownership is concentrated in the hands of prominent families and businesses. Consequently, some reports tend to be one-sided presentations favoring special interests. The privately owned press also tends toward sensationalism at times. &lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Philippines.pdf Philippines country profile].
