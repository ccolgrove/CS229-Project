'''AbiWord''' is a [[free and open source software]] [[word processor]]. It was originally started by SourceGear Corporation as the first part of a proposed AbiSuite. Development stopped when SourceGear changed their focus to [[Internet appliance]]s. AbiWord was adopted by some open source developers and AbiWord continued to be developed. The name &quot;AbiWord&quot; (pronounced [Ã¦biË], like the name, &quot;Abby&quot; + [wÉrd]) is derived from the root of the Spanish word &quot;''[[wikt:en:abierto#Spanish|abierto]]''&quot;, meaning &quot;open&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;abi&quot;&gt;Project Mascot [http://www.abisource.com/~abi/ Abi the Ant].  Page explains Abi is pronounced just like &quot;Abby&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It runs on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[ReactOS]], Solaris, [[AmigaOS]] 4.0 (through its [[Cygnix]] [[X11]] engine), and other [[operating system]]s. However, the [[Mac OS X]] port has remained on version 2.4 since 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; although the current version does run non-natively on Mac OS X through [[X11.app]]. AbiWord is part of the [[AbiSource]] project which develops a number of [[office suite|office-related]] technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;abisource&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
AbiWord supports both basic word processing features such as lists, indents and character formats, and more sophisticated features including tables, styles, page headers and footers, [[footnotes]], templates, multiple views, page columns, [[spell check]]ing, and [[grammar check]]ing.&lt;ref name=&quot;grammar-check&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| date = 2005-10-15

| quote = &quot;The recently released AbiWord-2.4...is the first Free Word Processor to offer an integrated Grammar Checker&quot;
| accessdate = 2007-11-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with version 2.8.0, AbiWord includes a [[collaborative software|collaboration]] plugin that allows integration with AbiCollab.net, a Web-based service that permits multiple users to work on the same document [[Collaborative real-time editor|in real time]], in full synchronization.  The Presentation view of AbiWord, which permits easy display of presentations created in AbiWord on &quot;screen-sized&quot; pages, is another feature not often found in word processors.  However, due to the incomplete compatibility with Microsoft Word, one cannot transfer a complete table.  When a table is transferred from AbiWord to Microsoft Word not all of the data will transfer properly.

===Interface===
AbiWord generally works similarly to classic versions (pre-Office 2007) of [[Microsoft Word]], as direct ease of migration was a high priority early goal.  While many interface similarities remain, cloning the Word interface is not a top priority.  The interface is intended to follow user interface guidelines for each respective platform.

===File formats===
AbiWord comes with several import and export filters for formats including [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Word]] (.doc), [[Office Open XML]] (.docx),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[OpenDocument|OpenDocument Text]] (.odt), [[Rich Text Format]] (.rtf), and [[Plain text|text document]]s (.txt). [[LaTeX]] is supported for export only. Plug-in filters are available to deal with many other formats, notably [[WordPerfect]] documents. The native [[file format]], .abw, uses [[XML]], so as to mitigate [[vendor lock-in]] concerns with respect to interoperability and [[digital archiving]].

===Grammar checking===
The AbiWord project includes a grammar checking plugin using [[Link Grammar]]. AbiWord had grammar checking before any other open source word processor, although a grammar checker was later added to [[OpenOffice.org]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grammar-check&quot; /&gt; Link Grammar is both a theory of syntax and an open source parser which is now{{When|date=May 2010}} developed by the AbiWord project.

===Version differences===
AbiWord 2.6.x does not support Windows 9x. Users of these systems may still use [http://www.abisource.com/downloads/abiword/2.5.2/ AbiWord 2.5.2].
