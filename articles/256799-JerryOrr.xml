An '''aphorism''' (literally is a &quot;distinction&quot; or &quot;definition&quot;, {{ety|gre|á¼ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼ÏÏ (aphorismÃ³s)}}, {{ety||á¼ÏÏ (apo)|||á½ÏÎ¯Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½ (horizein)|from/to bound}}) is an original thought, spoken or written in a [[laconic]] and memorable form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=aphorism Definition of ''aphorism''] from the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was first used in the ''[[s:Aphorisms|Aphorisms]]'' of [[Hippocrates]]. The oft-cited first sentence of this work (see [[Ars longa, vita brevis]]) is:
{{cquote|&quot;Life is short, art long, opportunity fleeting, experience deceptive, judgment difficult.&quot;}}

The term was later applied to maxims of physical science, then statements of all kinds of philosophical, moral, or literary principles. In modern usage an aphorism is generally understood to be a concise statement containing a subjective [[truth]] or observation cleverly and pithily  written.

==Literature==

Aphoristic collections, sometimes known as [[wisdom literature]], have a prominent place in the canons of several ancient societies, such as the [[Sutra]] literature of [[India]], the [[Biblical]] [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Islam]]ic [[Hadith]], [[Hesiod]]'s ''Works and Days'', or [[Epictetus]]' Handbook.  Aphoristic collections also make up an important part of the work of some modern authors, such as [[JosemarÃ­a EscrivÃ¡]] (compiled from other spiritual authors), [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Karl Kraus]], [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]], [[FranÃ§ois de La Rochefoucauld (writer)|La Rouchefoucauld]], [[Stanislaw Jerzy Lec]], [[Andrzej Majewski]], [[Mikhail Turovsky]], [[Antonio Porchia]], [[Celia Green]], [[Robert A. Heinlein]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[E. M. Cioran]] and [[Oscar Wilde]].  A 1559 oilâonâoak-panel painting, [[Netherlandish Proverbs]] (also called The Blue Cloak or The Topsy Turvy World) by [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]], artfully depicts a land populated with literal renditions of Flemish aphorisms ([[proverb]]s) of the day.

The aphoristic genre developed together with literacy, and after the invention of printing, aphorisms were collected and published in book form. The first noted published collection of aphorisms is ''[[Adagia]]'' by [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]. Other important early aphorists were [[Baltasar GraciÃ¡n]], [[FranÃ§ois de La Rochefoucauld]] and [[Blaise Pascal]].

Two influential collections of aphorisms published in the 20th century were ''The Uncombed Thoughts'' by [[Stanislaw Jerzy Lec]] (in Polish), and ''Itch of Wisdom'' by [[Mikhail Turovsky]] (in Russian and English).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoples.ru/art/painter/turovskiy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==

In many cultures, including [[Samuel Johnson]]'s England, many [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]n societies,&lt;!-- Citation on Talk page; don't know how to do proper ref=2008-07-13 --&gt; and  throughout the world, the ability to spontaneously produce aphoristic sayings at exactly the right moment is a key determinant of social status. Many societies have traditional sages or [[culture hero]]es to whom aphorisms are commonly attributed, such as the [[Seven Sages of Greece]], [[Confucius]] or [[King Solomon]].

Misquoted or misadvised aphorisms are frequently used as a source of humour; for instance, wordplays of aphorisms appear in the works of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Terry Pratchett]] and [[Douglas Adams]]. Aphorisms being misquoted by sports players, coaches, and commentators form the basis of [[Private Eye|Private Eye's]] [[Colemanballs]] section.
