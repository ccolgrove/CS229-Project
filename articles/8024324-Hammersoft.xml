In ''Saw III'', after Matthews is kidnapped and presumed dead following the events of ''II'', Kerry becomes wracked with guilt for his loss. She and [[Mark Hoffman|Detective Hoffman]] are assigned a case where Kerry points out that a trap does not follow Jigsaw's [[modus operandi]], because the trap did not give the victim a chance to escape, and thus does not believe Jigsaw is responsible for it.

*Portrayed by [[Cary Elwes]] (film) and [[Stan Kirsch]] (animated comic).
*Appears in: ''Saw: Rebirth'', ''Saw'', ''Saw 3D''

Dr. Lawrence Gordon is the man responsible for diagnosing John Kramer's cancer and is initially a suspect in the Jigsaw case. As Jigsaw, John targeted Gordon for engaging in an affair with his medical student, Carla Song, despite having a loving family. Gordon is placed in a trap alongside Adam Stanheight and tasked with killing him before the time limit ran out or his wife and daughter would be executed. He fails to do this, but instead severs his own foot to free himself from his shackles, attempting to crawl to freedom and promising to bring help back for Adam.  After crawling from the bathroom, he uses a hot steam pipe to [[Cauterization|cauterize]] his wound and prevent fatal blood loss.  Jigsaw finds him unconscious shortly after and begins helping him recover from his injury, later fitting him with a prosthetic foot.  

Jigsaw manages to recruit Gordon's aid afterwards, employing his talents in many of his traps such as sewing the key behind [[#Michael Marks|Michael]]'s eye (''Saw II''), suggesting [[#Lynn Denlon|Lynn Denlon]] as a test subject (''Saw III''), stitching [[#Trevor|Trevor]]'s eyes shut (''Saw IV'') and writing a cryptic note that Hoffman found on his desk (''Saw V'').  Following Jigsaw's death, Gordon is left a package that is delivered by his wife Jill, that contains instructions to watch over Jill on his behalf.  After Hoffman kills Jill and attempts to flee, he is ambushed by three people in Pig masks, their leader revealed as Gordon.  Hoffman is taken to the bathroom trap originally used on Gordon and shacked.

Mark is stripped naked and informed that he had a slow-acting poison in his body, and the antidote is locked away in a safe in the room. Mark has to overcome the broken-glass covered floor and use a candle to read the safe combination written on the wall, wary of the fact his flesh is smeared with [[napalm]]. Mark eventually fumbles with the candle and the substance ignites, burning him alive; his charred corpse is found later by police. According to the list in ''Saw V'', Mark is the second victim of Jigsaw's traps.  A case file from Detective Tapp reveals that he is using his &quot;illness&quot; for medical insurance fraud, and that he used Umbrella Insurance, the same group of people tested in ''Saw VI''.{{clarify|date=September 2011}}

===Paul Leahy===

*Portrayed by Mike Butters
*Appears in: ''Saw: Rebirth'', ''Saw'', ''Saw IV'', ''Saw V''

Paul is one of Jigsaw's earliest victims, chosen because he attempted suicide by cutting his wrists despite having a 'good' life with a wife and kids. Paul is placed in a large cage lined with a maze of [[razor wire]] and is given 2 hours to crawl his way to freedom, the irony of this being that if Paul wants to live he would have to cut himself but if he really wants to die, all he has to do is wait. Paul dies of injuries from the razor wire before reaching the exit. Paul is later seen in ''Saw IV'' leaving Jill's drug clinic. In ''Saw V'', Paul is shown being kidnapped by Jigsaw and Hoffman for his test in ''Saw''.

===Steven Sing===
{{anchor|Detective Sing|Steven Sing}}
*Portrayed by [[Ken Leung]]
*Appears in: ''Saw'', ''Saw V''

Steven Sing is a detective who is called to the crime scene investigation of one of Jigsaw's victims. He and his partner, David Tapp, are assigned to the case. Tapp found a clue in one of the tapes left over from the crime scene, leading Sing and Tapp right to Jigsaw's hideout. There, they find a [[#Jeff Ridenhour|Jeff Ridenhour]] in a trap with drills aimed at his neck. Jigsaw arrives and activates the device when the officers exposed themselves, forcing the detectives to choose between arresting him or saving Jeff. Sing shot the drills and deactivates them before pursuing Jigsaw through the warehouse after Jigsaw slashes Tapp's throat with a hidden wrist-blade. While in pursuit, Sing accidentally activates a tripwire which triggeres four shotguns hidden above to fire and kill him. Sing's death triggeres Tapp's obsession with Jigsaw. In ''Saw V'', Sing is given a police memorial.

It is shown in the [[Saw: The Video Game|video game]] that Sing has a wife named [[#Melissa Sing|Melissa]] and a son named Franklin. Melissa encounters Tapp during the game and blames him for the death of her husband. In one of Tapp's case files found in ''[[Saw II: Flesh &amp; Blood]]'', Detective Tapp establishes a great deal of respect and admiration for his partner's work ethic, though he also notes that &quot;he tends to drink more than most. Doesn't seem to affect his judgement though.&quot;

===Zep Hindle===
{{anchor|Zepp Hindle|Zep|Zepp}}
*Portrayed by [[Michael Emerson]] (film) and Jeff Shuter (animated comic).
*Appears in: ''Saw: Rebirth'', ''Saw''

Zep is an [[orderly]] who worked in the hospital where John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, is treated for his cancer. He forms a bond with John while he is being treated, but is considered to have &quot;issues of his own&quot; by him. John seems to see a lot of his own actions in Zep's goals, reminding him of himself before he is diagnosed with cancer.&lt;ref name=SawRebirth&gt;[[Saw: Rebirth]]&lt;/ref&gt; Zep is later forced to watch Adam Stanheight and Dr. Gordon play out their game that takes place in a bathroom. If Lawrence fails to kill Adam by 6:00, then Zep will be forced to kill Lawrence's wife and child, whom he has been holding hostage, in order to save himself from the slow-acting nerve agent in his bloodstream. He will then have to kill Lawrence himself and retrieve an antidote from Jigsaw. Lawrence fails, but his wife and daughter manage to escape from Zep's grip before he can kill them, as Zep is attacked by David Tapp, a former detective who is watching the Gordons' home from across the street. Zep is forced to flee down to the sewers that leads to the bathroom to kill Lawrence, but Tapp follows him; the two fought, and Zep shot Tapp in the chest and leaves him to die.  In the bathroom, where Lawrence has already shot Adam, Zep prepares to kill Lawrence. Before he could do so, though, Adam knocks him down and beats him to death with a toilet tank lid.

Throughout the film, Zep is presented as a [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]], with the audience being encouraged to believe that he is Jigsaw, rather than a victim of one of Jigsaw's games. The truth is revealed only after Adam searches the body, looking for a key to free himself, and finds a microcassette recorder that contains Jigsaw's instructions to Zep. On the commentary for ''Saw'', Leigh Whannell and James Wan stated that Zep enjoyed the sense of power he is given over others which he did not have before. Zep's decomposed corpse is later shown in ''Saw II'', ''Saw III'' and ''Saw 3D''.

When she reaches into a hanging glass box to retrieve an antidote syringe, her arms become caught in folding razor blades and she begins bleeding heavily while trying to pull free. Xavier later finds her, but after reading the number on the back of her neck, he leaves her to bleed to death. In ''Saw IV'' she is shown prior to John Kramer becoming Jigsaw, offering him 'company' in her role as a prostitute.

It is revealed in the commentary for the second film that there is a key already in the lock at the back of the trap Addison died in, and all she had to do in order to live is to turn it and grab the antidote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=David Hackl (production designer) |date=2005 |title=The Traps of Saw II: The Hand Trap |medium=DVD |publisher=Lionsgate Home Entertainment |accessdate={{nowrap|August 25, 2011}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also revealed her trap is intended for Gus, who died earlier on, which is why she is shown ripping up his envelope and tossing his tape aside.{{cn|date=September 2011}} Addison's trap is supposed to be a &quot;waffle iron,&quot; which she would have to push her face into, a concept that was partially resurrected in Saw IV with the Knife Chair Trap.{{cn|date=September 2011}} According to the ''Saw II'' website, Addison is written to be 29 years old.&lt;ref name=OfficialSawII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saw2.com/censored/site.html|Official ''Saw II'' website|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lionsgate]]|accessdate={{nowrap|September 22, 2011}}|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051215113922/http://saw2.com/censored/site.html|archivedate{{nowrap|October 7, 2007}}|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daniel Matthews===
{{anchor|Daniel Matthews|Daniel}}
*Portrayed by [[Erik Knudsen]]
*Appears in: ''Saw II''

Daniel appears in ''Saw II'', as the son of Eric Matthews. After a falling out with his father, Daniel goes missing but is reveals to have been captured and placed in another of Jigsaw's games alongside several convicts, all arrested by Daniel's father. As the game progresses, Daniel's lineage is discovered and he is abandoned by many of the other victims. With time running low, Daniel and Amanda begins to work together to get away from Xavier, an enraged victim who is hunting them. Xavier eventually finds them but Daniel manages to slice open Xavier's neck with a saw, killing him and saving Amanda and himself. After these events it is revealed that Amanda, Jigsaw's new apprentice, had taken the unconscious Daniel to Jigsaw's lair and they had locked him in a safe as an incentive for Eric Matthews in his own test. He appears in a flashback (with the use of a [[body double]]) in ''Saw V'', and is seen in archive footage in the endings of ''Saw III'' and ''Saw 3D''.

===Daniel Rigg===
{{anchor|Daniel Rigg|Rigg}}
*Portrayed by [[Lyriq Bent]]
*Appears in: ''Saw II'', ''Saw III'', ''Saw IV'', ''Saw V''

Daniel Rigg is a [[S.W.A.T.]] officer who first appears in ''Saw II'', assisting detectives Eric Matthews and Allison Kerry in arresting Jigsaw, but ultimately failing to capture the felon after Eric helped Jigsaw escape. He holds the rank of Sergeant for this film, but is promoted to Lieutenant and put in command of the S.W.A.T. team before the events of ''Saw III''. Appearing only briefly in ''Saw III'', Rigg is eventually put into a series of tests as the protagonist in ''Saw IV'', in which he has to rethink many of the Jigsaw Killer's ideals. He suffers a gunshot wound to the stomach in his final test; and it is revealed that he died of blood loss in ''Saw V'' and is also given a memorial, along with Detectives Eric Matthews, Allison Kerry, David Tapp, and Steven Sing. On the Photographs of the five dead officers, Rigg's picture shows his first name as Daniel.

Lyriq Bent has remarked that: &quot;I didn't know what to expect of his character in the fourth movie. Lieutenant Rigg has really come into himself. In ''Saw II'', he is really the strong, silent type that really didn't know what is going on around him. You had a sense that there is something going on with him internally, and I think that sparked a lot of curiosity in the audience. They wanted to know, 'Who is this guy, and what's he all about?' In ''Saw IV'', you get to find out who he is, and what he's all about, and how he feels about the situation that he's in, and how he feels about the type of work that he's in and people and all that. And I think he's a character that people are gonna like, because they can relate to him on so many different levels. He's a real person. In ''Saw IV'', you get to go on a journey with him, and it's pretty much an emotional journey. At the end, I only hope that the audience will be as exhausted and worn out as he is, because he becomes this broken man.&quot;{{cn|date=September 2011}}

Eric, concerned about his son, refuses to follow Jigsaw's rules and in doing so he ended up brutalizing the weakened cancer patient and later becomes trapped and shackled in the same bathroom in which Adam dies in. However, he shatters his own foot to allow him to squeeze free of the shackle and pursue Amanda, his captor and one of the victims of his evidence-planting. He brutally beats Amanda before she gained the upper-hand and leaves him for dead. Jigsaw later finds Matthews, had his foot repaired and held him captive until he could be used in a trap designed for Daniel Rigg.

He can not bring himself to cut out his eye and is killed when the helmet's timer runs out and is slammed shut on his head.

Michael is seen again later in a flashback in ''Saw IV'', in the waiting room of Jill's clinic. It is shown in ''Saw V'' that his family name is Marks, as indicated by a document observed by Agent Strahm.

Jeff's surname is &quot;Denlon&quot; in the film, but is &quot;Reinhart&quot; on the back of the ''Saw III'' DVD cover.

When asked whether he liked his character even though he hesitated in saving people, Angus Macfadyen said, &quot;Yeah, well, I think it's kind of set up in the film that even though you think he could save them, even when he tries to, it's set-up so it all seems a little too late. That is something we were discussing is how long do you wait and pause? Because if you've done that in one room, you know you can't do that in the next because otherwise it's going to be too late for that person. So we were having lots of debates. And also because each scene, you can't play them all the same. You've got to build in each one. So did I like him? I don't think he liked himself very much.&quot;&lt;ref name=IGNAngus&gt;[http://movies.ign.com/articles/742/742130p2.html IGN interview with Angus Macfadyen]&lt;/ref&gt;

She performs extensive [[brain surgery]] and care to ensure he stays alive until her husband Jeff completed his three tests. Lynn is supposed to be released when Jeff finished, but ultimately Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda Young refuses, believing that she had not learned anything from her experience and jealous of the attention Jigsaw had shown her. Lynn is injured by a gunshot from Amanda before being revealed as Jeff Denlon's estranged wife. Jeff then kills Amanda and Jigsaw, unknowingly activating his wife's trap, blowing her head to pieces. She appears in archive footage in ''Saw IV'', ''Saw V'', ''Saw VI'' and ''Saw 3D''. In ''Saw 3D'', it is revealed that it is Lawrence Gordon who suggests her as a suitable doctor to operate on Jigsaw, showing him a photo of her.

When asked about why she believed her character is being tested, Bahar Soomekh said, &quot;I think this is what's so interesting and that's what I would ask is in Jigsaw's mind he's justified in everything that he does, right? These are people, whether they are drug dealers or they've done something wrong. But that's how psychotic and wrong he actually is. Because he justifies it. What did Lynn do? That's what's so disturbing because he's not justified at all in doing what he does. In his mind, he thinks he's helping these people. How does he help Lynn? He doesn't help Lynn at all. But I think, in his mind, because my character's depressed ... so she's been dead inside. She's totally dead inside and this is Jigsaw's way of waking her up and saying, 'What the hell are you doing?' And she does. You see the metamorphosis in her.&quot;&lt;ref name=IGNBahar&gt;[http://movies.ign.com/articles/742/742130p1.html IGN interview with Bahar Soomekh]&lt;/ref&gt;

As they follow the trail of Rigg's tests, it becomes apparent at one of the locations they come across that they themselves were being targeted by Jigsaw, as Kerry had warned. At the last building that Rigg had been at, Perez barely escapes death when Strahm pulled her out of the firing path of a harpoon (which in turn hit a crime scene photographer). Minutes later, they entered a room where they are confronted with a Billy doll and a tape meant for her. As she leaned forward to hear what the voice is saying, the Billy doll's face explodes, severely injuring her face and neck with shrapnel.

She is revealed to have been part of a criminal conspiracy alongside Carla, Henry, and Joseph; her role being to sell drugs on the streets.  While searching for Jigsaw, David Tapp discovers their drug cartel and Sarah is used to mislead him, even though she is aware that Tapp is not concerned about the drug cartel because of his obsession with Jigsaw.

Joseph sneaks up on Sarah and shoots her in the head.

===Solomon Bates===
*Appears in: ''Saw II: Flesh &amp; Blood''

Solomon is an accountant involved in a housing development project with John Kramer and Art Blank before the events that would turn John into Jigsaw. He is later responsible for using his accountancy role to hide the illegal money made by the drug cartel consisting of Henry, Joseph, Carla and Sarah, thus bringing him to Jigsaw's attention. When Michael finds him, Solomon is found chained to a suspended cart set on a track filled with slowly-rising flames that will burn him alive unless Michael pushes him out of harm's way. Upon his release, he reveals the truth about the members of the drug cartel and that Michael's father accidentally stumbled on their operations during his search for Jigsaw. He is last seen being cornered by Pighead II and thrown into a pit of syringes. Pighead II then seals the door before Michael can enter.
