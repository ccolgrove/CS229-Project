'''GNU variants''' is a term used by the [[Free Software Foundation]] and others{{Citation needed|the sources given does not contain the specific term &quot;GNU variants&quot;|date=August 2011}} to refer to [[operating system]]s which use [[application software]] and [[library (computing)|system libraries]] (in other words, the core userland) from [[GNU]].

|quote = Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is more often known as âLinuxâ, and many users are not aware of the extent of its connection with the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is not the operating system. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Hurd variants ==
'''[[Arch Hurd]]''' is a derivative work of [[Arch Linux]], porting it to the [[GNU Hurd]] system with packages optimised for the [[Intel P6]] architecture. Their goal is to provide an Arch-like user environment ([[BSD]]-style [[init]] scripts, [[Pacman (package manager)|Pacman package manager]], rolling releases, and a simple set up) on the Hurd which is stable enough for at least occasional use. Currently it provides a [[LiveCD]] for evaluation purposes and installations guides for LiveCD and conventional installation.

'''[[Debian GNU/Hurd]]''' is under development but not ready for official release in the near future. It is not considered yet to provide the performance and stability expected from a production system. About half of the Debian packages have been ported to Hurd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/index.en.html Debian: Debian GNU/Hurd]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linux variants ==
{{details|GNU/Linux naming controversy}}
{{Main|Linux distribution}}
The term '''GNU/Linux''' is used by some to refer to an operating system where the [[Linux kernel]] is distributed with a GNU [[Userland (computing)|userland]] and GNU [[system software]]. Such [[Linux distribution|distributions]] are the primary installed base of [[List of GNU packages|GNU packages and programs]] and also of Linux. The most notable official use of this term for a distribution is [[Debian]] GNU/Linux.

== BSD variants ==
'''Debian GNU/kFreeBSD''' is an operating system for [[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]] computer architectures. It is a distribution of GNU with Debian [[package management]] and the kernel of [[FreeBSD]]. The ''k'' in ''kFreeBSD'' is an abbreviation for ''kernel of'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/kFreeBSD_FAQ#Q.Whatdoesthe.27k.27in.22kFreeBSD.22standfor.3F | title = Debian GNU/kFreeBSD FAQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and reflects the fact that only the kernel of the complete FreeBSD operating system is used. The operating system was officially released with Debian Squeeze (6.0) on February 6, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.debian.org/News/2011/20110205a
|title=Debian 6.0 Squeeze released
}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One Debian GNU/kFreeBSD [[live CD]] is Ging, which is no longer maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=The Ging FAQ
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Debian GNU/NetBSD''' was an experimental port of [[Debian GNU/Linux]] user-land applications to [[NetBSD]] kernel. No official release of this operating system was made; although work was conducted on ports for the [[IA-32]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debian.org/ports/netbsd/index&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DEC Alpha]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debian.org/ports/netbsd/alpha&lt;/ref&gt; architectures, it has not seen active maintenance since 2002 and is no longer available for download.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debian.org/ports/netbsd/news&lt;/ref&gt;

== OpenSolaris variants ==
{{Main|Nexenta OS}}
'''Nexenta OS''' is the first distribution that combines the GNU userland (with the exception of libc; [[OpenSolaris]]' libc is used) and Debian's packaging and organisation with the [[OpenSolaris]] kernel. Nexenta OS is available for [[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]] based systems. Nexenta Systems, Inc initiated the project and sponsors its continued development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
