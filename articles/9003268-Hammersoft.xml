She was the only actor from the British series of ''As If'' to star in the [[As If (US TV series)|American version]], moving to [[Los Angeles]].

Engaged to a Royal Navy sailor and a keen [[Underwater diving|diver]], in 2009 Corrie enlisted in the Royal Navy after becoming disillusioned with life as an actress. She completed her basic training at [[HMS Raleigh (shore establishment)|HMS Raleigh]] in [[Cornwall]], where her passing out ceremony was held in October.
