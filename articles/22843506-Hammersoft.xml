The second season of '''''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me out of Here! (U.S. TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me out of Here!]]''''' premiered on June 1, 2009 and concluded on June 24, 2009. The season, aired on [[NBC]], a revival of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series of the same name and continued to follow the same format as the [[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me out of Here! (UK)|original British series]]. It is also broadcast in [[Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In Ireland, the show airs on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]], three days behind the original NBC airings, and in the UK, it airs on [[ITV2]] with a seven day delay. This show has been airing on [[STAR World]] in [[South East Asia]], Hong  Kong, Taiwan and Korea from July 8, 2009.

With the network change, the series changed hosts, with [[Myleene Klass]] and [[Damien Fahey]] presenting the second season. The revival began with eleven contestants who were originally split into two teams: red and yellow. Shortly thereafter, the eleven contestants were split into teams based on gender. [[Heidi Pratt|Heidi]] and [[Spencer Pratt]] quit the show on day two,&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews.com&quot;&gt;''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'': [http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/06/02/2009-06-02_spencer_and_heidi_pratt_quit_im_a_celebrity.html &quot;Spencer and Heidi Pratt quit 'I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!'&quot;] (June 2, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; but they both returned,&lt;ref name=&quot;nbc.com&quot;&gt;''[[NBC]]'': [http://www.nbc.com/news/2009/06/03/heidi-and-spencer-pratt-return-to-nbcs-hit-reality-series-im-a-celebrityget-me-out-of-here-live-toni/ &quot;Heidi and Spencer Pratt Return to NBC's Hit Reality Series 'I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;] (June 3, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; only to withdraw once again for a final time when Heidi became ill. [[Daniel Baldwin]] (Stephen Baldwin's brother) joined the show partway through the season, and [[Holly Montag]] (Heidi Pratt's sister) became a cast member soon after.

John and Stephen won the challenge by collecting the most flags in the least time. The reward was &quot;Chinese takeout&quot;.

Meanwhile, Janice's teammates were becoming irritated with her making excuses for her loss, despite her insistence to compete in the challenge.
Back at the camp, Sanjaya cooked a pasta dinner with an oil-based sauce for everyone. John did not like it and made it known. The hosts even commented about John being a great addition to the TV show &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot;.
There were constant references to the closeness shared by Patti and John. So also with Sanjaya and Holly. Holly's self-portrait was about the time she spent swimming with Sanjaya in the river. Janice commented that the drawing would look good in their wedding invitation.

==Controversy==
[[Heidi Pratt|Heidi]] and [[Spencer Pratt]]'s behavior on the show was largely criticized by the media. The couple claimed they were subject to torture and left the show's set multiple times before returning and ultimately withdrawing.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailynews.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbc.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spencer, Heidi jeopardize&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Spencer, Heidi jeopardize their fragile 'fame' | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31187605/ | last=Holmes | first=Linda | publisher=MSNBC.com | date=2009-06-09 | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]'', in an article, referred to their antics as &quot;reasons that television is going downhill&quot; and also revealed they only spent 14 hours inside of the chamber and were given food and water the whole time they were in it.

It was reported on June 7, 2009 that Heidi, who was last seen with Spencer being told they have to sleep in the Lost Chamber; and later be told what their fate would be after the team had decided what their choice was in terms of them re-entering camp, was hospitalized due to a putative [[gastric ulcer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/07/heidi-rushed-to-hospital-_n_212262.html Heidi Rushed to Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt;
