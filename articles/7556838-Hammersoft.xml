The '''Victory Bell''' is an annual trophy given to either the [[University of Southern California]] or the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. The winner of the annual [[UCLAâUSC rivalry|USC-UCLA rivalry]] football contest keeps the bell for the next year, and paints it the school's color: &quot;[[True Blue (color)|True Blue]]&quot; for UCLA, or [[Cardinal (color)|cardinal]] for USC. The Victory Bell is a 295-pound brass bell that originally rang atop a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad [[locomotive]]. It is currently mounted on a special wheeled carriage.

==History==
The bell was given to the UCLA student body in [[1939]] as a gift from the school's Alumni Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uclalumni.net/ UCLA Alumni Association]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UCLA Alumni Association [http://www.uclalumni.net/About/History/1944_53_3.cfm?highlight=victory%20bell About the Association]. The Post-War Years, 1944 - 1953&lt;/ref&gt;. Initially, the UCLA cheerleaders rang the bell after each Bruin point.  However, during the opening game of UCLA's [[1941]] season (at the time, both schools used the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] for home games), six members of USC's [[Trojan Knights]] (who were also members of the [[Sigma Phi Epsilon|SigEp fraternity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.sigepusc.com/page.php?page_id=18734 | title =SigEp USC - Victory Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;) infiltrated the Bruin rooting section, assisted in loading the bell aboard a truck headed back to [[Westwood, California|Westwood]], took the key to the truck, and escaped with the bell while UCLA's actual rooters went to find a replacement key. The bell remained hidden from UCLA students for more than a year, first in SigEpâs basement, then in the [[Hollywood Hills]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] and other locations. At one point, it was even concealed beneath a haystack. Bruin students tried to locate the bell, but to no avail. A picture of the bell appeared in a USC periodical. Tension between UCLA and USC students rose as each started to play even more elaborate and disruptive pranks on the other.  When the conflict caused the USC President to threaten to cancel the rivalry, a compromise was met: on November 12, 1942, the student body presidents of both schools, in front of Tommy Trojan, signed the agreement that the bell would be the trophy for the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magazine.ucla.edu/depts/hailhills/victory-bell/ Gong with the Wind] UCLA Magazine, sourced from the UCLA History Project, October 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==USC==
Before home games, when the bell is in USC's possession, it sits along Trousdale Parkway for fans to ring as they participate in the &quot;Trojan Walk&quot; to the L.A. Coliseum. During home games, and whenever USC faces UCLA at the Rose Bowl, the Victory Bell is displayed at the edge of the field for the first three quarters of the game. Members of the [[Trojan Knights]] and [[USC Helenes]] ring the bell every time the Trojans score. The carriage is painted cardinal red.

==UCLA==
When the bell is in UCLA's possession, the carriage is sandblasted and painted &quot;True Blue&quot;.  While in the possession of UCLA, the Bell is safeguarded by the [[UCLA Rally Committee]]&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/rallycom/ UCLA Rally Committee]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studentgroups.ucla.edu/sgweb/details_frame.asp?OrgID=165 UCLA Student Groups - Rally Committee: Statement of Purpose]&lt;/ref&gt;.  During UCLA home games at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] and whenever UCLA faces USC at the Los Angeles Coliseum, it resides on the field in front of the student section.  It is rung by members of the Rally Committee after each score. The Bruins also ring the bell using a rope attached to the handle, swinging the whole bell, as opposed to the Trojan style of attaching a rope to the tongue or clapper on the inside of the bell. The Bell also makes special appearances at rallies and athletic events. It has been used to accompany the [[UCLA Band]] during halftime shows. In particular the bell will make an appearance at a major gathering when the bell returns to UCLA. &lt;ref&gt;Tuesday, December 5, 2006, where it was rung by head football coach [[Karl Dorrell]] at a home basketball game to celebrate the recent [[UCLAâUSC rivalry#Football series record|victory over USC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series Record==
{{seealso|UCLAâUSC rivalry#Football Series Record}}
The first victory for UCLA in the series occurred after the agreement, making the Bruins the first winner of the trophy. The Bruins made their post-season appearance in the [[1943 Rose Bowl]]. The teams played each other twice in the same season in 1943, 1944, and 1945. This was due to travel restrictions during [[World War II]].

USC has held the bell since the 2007 football season, winning 24-7 against its unranked rival (used to be ranked 14th preseason in the AP Poll). The Victory Bell was held by USC through the 1999-2005 football seasons. USC leads with an overall record of 45-28-7 in football contests with UCLA. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/pac10/southern_california/opponents.php Complete USC Football records against all opponents, College Football Data Warehouse]&lt;/ref&gt;. Before the streak of seven Trojan wins, the Bruins had won the Bell for the eight consecutive years from 1991-1998, the longest streak in the rivalry. There have been 7 ties and one overtime game in the history of the series.
