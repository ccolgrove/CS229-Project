'''Delaware State University''' (also referred to as '''DSU''', '''DESU''', or '''Del State'''), is an [[United States|American]] [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black]], [[public university]] located in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], [[Delaware]], and there are two [[satellite campus]]es located in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], Delaware, and [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]], Delaware.  With approximately 4,200 students, it is the second-largest university in the state (behind the [[University of Delaware]]) and encompasses six colleges and a diverse population of [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education|advanced-degree]] students.

==History==

The '''State College for Colored Students''' was established on May 15, 1891, by the [[Delaware General Assembly]]. It first awarded degrees in 1898. In 1944, the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools|Middle States Commission on Higher Education]] awarded the college provisional [[accreditation]]. Three years later, the institution became '''Delaware State College''' by legislative action. Although its accreditation was revoked in 1949, it was regained in 1957. On July 1, 1993, the institution changed its name yet again, this time to '''Delaware State University'''.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desu.edu/history |title=Delaware State University History |publisher=Delaware State University |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 21, 2007, campus shootings===
{{main|Delaware State University shooting}}
{{Wikinewspar|Two students shot at Delaware State University}}
On September 21, 2007, two university students were shot on campus near Memorial Hall around one a.m.  Classes were canceled for the day. One student was hospitalized in stable condition, and another student was hospitalized with injuries that were considered serious, according to a news release on the university's web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}{{cite news|author=''[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]]''|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jAWPn73xdPrG4b9FhHbtCUVgN6Ww|title=2 Students Shot at Delaware State|agency=Associated Press  |date=2007-09-21|accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campus was &quot;locked down&quot; with students confined to their dormitories and traffic blocked at the campus gate, through Sunday, September 23.  Classes resumed on September 24.  On that day, a freshman student was arrested for attempted murder in connection with the incident, and was [[Expulsion (academia)|expelled]] from the university.  The episode is significant because it marks the first test of a university's response to a campus shooting following the [[Virginia Tech shootings]] in April 2007. One of the students, a seventeen-year-old freshman, died.

==Campus==
The {{convert|400|acre|km2|sing=on}} main campus in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]], the capital of [[Delaware]], is an approximate two-hour motor drive from [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; and [[Washington, D.C.]], and three hours from [[New York City]], [[New York]]. 
There are satellite campuses in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] and [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].

The main campus in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]] contains thirty buildings, including:
{{multicol}} 
* Administration Building
* [[Alumni Stadium (Delaware State)|Alumni Stadium]]
* The Bank of America Building
* Delaware Hall
* Loockerman Hall
{{col-break}} 
* The Mishoe Science Center
* Price Building
* Willam C. Jason Library
* The Wellness and Recreation Center
{{col-end}}

There are seven campus residential halls: four for women, and three for men.  There are also three apartment-style residence halls for upperclassmen.  They include:

{{multicol}}
* Conwell Hall
* [[Harriet Tubman]] Hall
* Jenkins Hall
* Laws Hall
{{col-break}}
* [[Medgar Evers]] Hall
* University Courtyard Apartments
* University Village Complex
* Warren-Franklin Hall
{{col-end}} 

Two dining halls serve the more than 1,500 on-campus students.

As a part of the [[Internet2]] initiative, the university maintains several research computer laboratories including a high-performance computational cluster in its [[DESAC]] center. Almost every building has a computer lab and each student has a dedicated data port for internet access, their own phone, a campus email address, and cable television access in all residence hall rooms. Most campus buildings also offer wireless connectivity.

The university also has two farm properties in the [[Kenton, Delaware|Kenton]] and [[Smyrna, Delaware|Smyrna]] areas, and its Airway Science Program maintains it fleet of planes and base of operation at the Delaware Air Park in [[Cheswold, Delaware|Cheswold]].&lt;ref name=&quot;desu.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desu.edu/history|title=History|publisher=Delaware State University|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
