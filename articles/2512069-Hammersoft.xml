== MTV Branding ==

Upon its launch in Europe in the late 80s, MTV Europe made use of MTV US's on-air identity. Overtime, MTV Europe gradually produced its own on-air identity throughout the 1990s. From 1997, MTV's regionalization throughout Europe brought about specialized on-air identity which reflected the tastes and influences from each region. As part of a global rebranding strategy, [[MTV Networks International]] decided to produce a new on-air identity that would air on all MTV channels around the world (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil. On July 1, 2009 all 64 MTV channels globally began to share the same on-air branding. This branding made use of a standardized logo, idents and promos&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universaleverything.com/289&lt;/ref&gt; (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). The on-air branding initiative was called '''Pop X1000''' reflecting the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]], with additional designs added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding was overseen by [[Universal Everything]]. This branding was been adopted by MTV Networks Europe, MTV Networks Asia, MTV Networks Africa and MTV Networks Latin America. As part of MTV's rebrand awareness campaign MTV teamed up with Spanish retailer [[Zara (clothing)|ZARA]] in December 2009 to provide branded themed t-shirts and hoodies representing the &quot;Pop X 1000%&quot; campaign.&lt;ref&gt;http://presse.mtv.de/scripts/presseinformationen.php3?ACTION=anzeigen&amp;OFFSET=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zara.com/mtv/&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 8, 2010 MTV launched is third phase of idents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/november/mtv-55dsl-collaboration-yields-new-idents-and-t-shirts&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, MTV US rebranded its entire network of channels producing a revised version of the traditional MTV logo. It was decided that MTV Networks International channels would adopt this logo at a later date.  On July 1, 2011 MTV Networks Europe will rebrand its network across Europe and globally. MTV's will replace its traditional logo the MTV:Music Television logo to be replaced by the current MTV US logo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.totaaltv.nl/?action=nieuws&amp;id=5392&lt;/ref&gt;. On June 30, 2011 MTV's localized websites throughout Europe began to use the new branding. As part of a new strategy MTV Networks Europe will be part of Viacom Media International Networks. It is expected that MTV Networks Europe will be rebranded in winter 2011.

== Websites ==

Since January 2010, MTV Networks Europe has started to rebrand its localized websites featuring a standard website for each region. The website design is similar for each region but has information, news and entertainment specific to each region. MTV Belgium, MTV Netherlands, MTV Switzerland, MTV Portugal, MTV Sweden and MTV Denmark were the first to receive the new look website layout and design.

== MTV Licensing ==

MTV Networks Europe main headquarters are located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. In the past, most of the MTV channels throughout Europe are licensed through the UK broadcasting regulator [[Ofcom]]. This is not unusual within Europe, many broadcasters may locate their productions and output departments in one country but receive their broadcasting license from another European country. For example MTV Networks Europe in Warsaw often produces programming for much of Europe, while MTV Networks Europe in London operates the broadcasting and licensing issues for this programming. As of [[2010]], MTV Networks Europe now receive their broadcasting licenses from broadcasting authorities in the Czech Republic ([[RRTV]]). All pan-European channels and channels broadcasting in the Czech Republic and Poland are licenced by RRTV&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rrtv.cz/cz/static/prehledy/licencni-podminky.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. 

MTV Networks Europe's main brands include:

===MTV Structural changes (2009-present)===

*'''Baltic's Ceases Operations'''

[[MTV Networks Baltic]] a division of MTV Networks Europe has ceased the broadcasting of its local language feeds within the region with immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=4212&lt;/ref&gt; MTV Latvia and MTV Lithuania ceased operating as individual channels in January 2009 and replaced with [[MTV Latvia|MTV Lithuania and Latvia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=2530&lt;/ref&gt; As of 18 November 2009 both MTV Estonia and MTV Lithuania and Latvia have ceased operating. Both channels have been replaced by [[MTV Europe]] for the time being. MTV Networks International are to announce the future of MTV Estonia as a brand, while MTV Lithuania and Latvia will no-longer exist as a brand. MTV in the Baltic Region has been somewhat problematic, after a number of years under MTV Networks International (Europe), MTVNI established a licensing agreement with Ananey Communications in 2008 to continue to broadcast MTV Baltic's channels.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2008/07/31/new-owner-for-mtv-baltic/&lt;/ref&gt; With the global recession, advertising and sponsorship within the region became limited. Resulting in the closure of MTV Lithuania and replaced with MTV Latvia and Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/baltic_news/?doc=2530&lt;/ref&gt; Further financial difficulties resulted in the &quot;temporary&quot; closure of MTV Estonia and MTV Latvia and Lithuania.

*'''MTV Networks closes TMF in the Netherlands'''

On November 4, 2010 MTV Networks International offices in Amsterdam confirmed that from January 1, 2011 that [[TMF_Nederland|TMF]] in the Netherlands broadcasting hours would be reduced until 15:00 each day&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radio.nl/portal/home/medianieuws/010.archief/2010/11/158376.html&lt;/ref&gt;. From April 4, 2011 TMF was gradually replaced by Kindernet and where the channel was only available online from the former TMF.nl website. On September 1, 2011 TMF in the Netherlands ceased broadcasting. TMF Nederland was the original channel before launching local channels in Belgium, UK and Australia. These local channels have been replaced with different channels&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/946240/MTV-replace-TMF-music-channel-Viva/?DCMP=ILC-SEARCH&lt;/ref&gt;.  TMF's digital channels in the Netherlands TMF Live and TMF NL also ceased broadcasting. [[TMF Flanders]] in Belgium currently broadcasts as the only TMF channel.

*'''MTV restructures broadcasting in Northern Europe'''

VIMN North will operate from its central offices in [[Stockholm]] and [[Berlin]] . Resulting in job losses at its offices at MTV Networks Benelux in Belgium and the Netherlands. The re-alignment will see all music progamming come from its operations in Stockholm. Its Swedish offices operate local channels such as MTV and VH1 within VIMN North's portfoilio of music channels. All kids and family programming operates from [[Berlin]] these include localized versions of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick Jr]] and [[Kindernet]].
