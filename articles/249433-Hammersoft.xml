{{Politics of the United States}}

This article presents the historical development and role of '''political parties in [[politics of the United States|United States politics]]''', and outlines more extensively the significant modern [[political party|political parties]]. Throughout most of its history, American politics have been dominated by a [[two-party system]]. However, the [[United States Constitution]] has always been silent on the issue of political parties; at the time it was signed in 1787, there were no parties in the nation. Indeed, no nation in the world had voter-based political parties. The need to win popular support in a [[Republicanism in the United States|republic]] led to the formation of political parties in the 1790s. Americans were especially innovative in devising new campaign techniques that linked public opinion with public policy through the party.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J.  Dinkin,  ''Campaigning in America: A History of Election Practices.'' [http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=14291969 (Greenwood 1989) online version]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientists and historians have divided the development of America's two-party system into five eras.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kleppner, et al. ''The Evolution of American Electoral Systems'' (1983), &lt;/ref&gt;  The modern two-party system consists of the [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In general, since the 1930s the Democratic Party positions itself [[centre-left|left-of-center]] in American politics while the Republican Party positions itself as [[centre-right|right-of-center]].

Several [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] also operate in the United States, and from time to time achieve relatively minor representation at the national and state levels.&lt;ref&gt;William B. Hesseltine, ''Third-Party Movements in the United States'' (1962) &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[United States Constitution]] has never formally addressed the issue of political parties. The [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] did not originally intend for American politics to be partisan. In [[Federalist No. 9|Federalist Papers No. 9]] and [[Federalist No. 10|No. 10]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], respectively, wrote specifically about the dangers of domestic [[political faction]]s. In addition, the first [[President of the United States]], [[George Washington]], was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president.  Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite WS|title=Washington's Farewell Address|link=Washington's Farewell Address#20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American [[two-party system]] emerged from his immediate circle of advisers, including Hamilton and Madison.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hofstadter, ''The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780-1840'' (1970) &lt;/ref&gt;

===First Party System===
{{Main|First Party System}}
The First Party System of The United States featured the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]] and the [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republican Party]].  The Federalist Party grew from Washington's [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], who favored a strong united central government, close ties to Britain, an effective banking system, and close links between the government and men of wealth. The Democratic-Republican Party was founded by [[James Madison]] and by Washington's Secretary of State, [[Thomas Jefferson]], who strongly opposed Hamilton's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;William Nisbet Chambers, ed. ''The First Party System'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Era of Good Feelings]] (1816â1824), marked the end of the First Party System.  The elitism of the Federalists had diminished their appeal, and their refusal to support the [[War of 1812]] verged on secession and was a devastating blow when the war ended well. The [[Era of Good Feelings]] under President James Monroe (1816-24) marked a brief period in which partisanship was minimal.&lt;ref&gt;George Dangerfield, ''The Era of Good Feelings'' (1952) &lt;/ref&gt;  These good feelings inspired the first short-lived &quot;era of [[internal improvements]]&quot; from the [[18th United States Congress|18th]] through the [[25th United States Congress|25th Congress]], which ended with the [[panic of 1837]].&lt;ref&gt; Stephen Minicucci, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=275165&amp;fulltextType=RA&amp;fileId=S0898588X04000094 Internal Improvements and the Union, 1790â1860], Studies in American Political Development (2004), 18: p.160-185, (2004), Cambridge University Press, DOI: 10.1017/S0898588X04000094&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Party System===
{{Main|Second Party System}}
In 1828, The Second Party System saw a split of the Democratic-Republican Party into the [[Jacksonian Democracy|Jacksonian Democrats]], who grew into the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|modern Democratic Party]], led by [[Andrew Jackson]], and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], led by [[Henry Clay]].  The Democrats supported the primacy of the Presidency over the other branches of government, and opposed the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] as well as modernizing programs that they felt would build up [[industry]] at the expense of the [[taxpayer]].  The Whigs, on the other hand, advocated the primacy of [[United States Congress|Congress]] over the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] as well as policies of modernization and economic protectionism. Central political battles of this era were the [[Bank War]] and the [[Spoils system]] of federal patronage.

The 1850s saw the collapse of the Whig party, largely as a result of deaths in its leadership and a major intra-party split over slavery as a result of the [[Compromise of 1850]]. In addition, the fading of old economic issues removed many of the unifying forces holding the party together.

===Third Party System===
{{Main|Third Party System}}
The Third Party System stretched from 1854 to the mid 1890s, and was characterized by the emergence of the anti-slavery [[History of United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], which adopted many of the economic policies of the Whigs, such as national banks, railroads, high tariffs, homesteads and aid to land grant colleges.

===Fourth Party System===
{{Main|Fourth Party System}}
The Fourth Party System, 1896 to 1932, retained the same primary parties as the Third Party System, but saw major shifts in the central issues of debate.  This period also corresponded to the [[Progressive Era]], and was dominated by the Republican Party.

===Fifth Party System===
{{Main|Fifth Party System}}
The Fifth Party System emerged with the [[New Deal Coalition]] beginning in 1933.

==Modern U.S. political party system==
The modern political party system in the United States is a [[two-party system]]  dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  These two parties have won every [[United States presidential election]] since 1852 and have controlled the [[United States Congress]] since at least 1856.  Several other [[Third party (United States)|third parties]] from time to time achieve relatively minor representation at the national and state levels.

===Democratic Party===
{{Main|Democratic Party (United States)}}
The Democratic Party is one of two [[major party|major]] political parties in the United States. It is the oldest political party in the United States and among the oldest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jules|last=Witcover|title=Party of the People: A History of the Democrats|year=2003|chapter=1 | page=3}} &quot;The Democratic Party of the United States, the oldest existing in the world, was in a sense an illegitimate child, unwanted by the founding fathers of the American Republic.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=John | last=Micklethwait | authorlink=John Micklethwait| coauthors=Wooldridge, Adrian | title=The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America | year=2004 | page=15}} &quot;The country possesses the world's oldest written constitution (1787); the Democratic Party has a good claim to being the world's oldest political party.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029899/Democratic-Party#233981.toc Democratic Party], EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online, Accessed August 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Democratic Party, since the division of the Republican Party in the election of [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]], has consistently positioned itself to the [[Left-wing politics|left]] of the Republican Party in economic as well as social matters. The economically left-leaning philosophy of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], which has strongly influenced [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]], has shaped much of the party's economic agenda since [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]]. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] usually controlled the national government until the 1970s.

In 2004, it was the largest political party, with 72 million voters (42.6% of 169 million registered) claiming affiliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neuhart20040122&quot; /&gt; The president of the United States, [[Barack Obama]], is the 15th Democrat to hold the office, and since the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the Democratic Party is the [[Two-party system|majority party]] for the [[United States Senate]].

===Republican Party===
{{Main|Republican Party (United States)}}
The Republican Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States of America. It is often referred to as the Grand Old Party, GOP, and &quot;Gallant Old Party&quot;.
Founded in 1854 by [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery]] expansion activists and modernizers, the Republican Party rose to prominence with the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], the first Republican president. The party presided over the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] but was harried by internal factions and scandals toward the end of the 19th century. Today, the Republican Party supports an [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservative]] platform, with further foundations in [[economic liberalism]], [[fiscal conservatism]], and [[social conservatism]].

Former President [[George W. Bush]] is the 19th Republican to hold that office.  The party's nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] was Senator [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]]. It is currently the second largest party with 55 million registered members, encompassing roughly one third of the electorate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neuhart20040122&quot;&gt;{{cite news

|last=Neuhart|first=Al|title=Why politics is fun from catbirds' seats|work=|USA Today|accessdate=2007-07-11 | date=January 22, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], the Republicans have held a majority in the United States House of Representatives.

===Major Third Parties===
====Constitution Party====
{{Main|Constitution Party (United States)}}
The Constitution Party is a [[conservative]] [[United States political party]]. It was founded as the U.S. Taxpayers Party in 1992. The party's official name was changed to the ''Constitution Party'' in 1999; however, some state affiliate parties are known under different names.

According to ballot access expert [[Richard Winger]], the editor of ''[[Ballot Access News]]'', who periodically compiles and analyzes voter registration statistics as reported by state voter agencies, it ranks third nationally amongst all United States [[Political party|political parties]] in registered voters, with 438,222 registered members as of October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballot-access.org/2007/010107.html#11 NOVEMBER 2006 REGISTRATION TOTALS]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes it currently the largest third party in the United States.

The Constitution Party advocates a platform that they believe reflects the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]' [[originalism|original intent]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], principles found in the [[U.S. Declaration of Independence]], and morals taken from the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;http://constitutionparty.com/party_platform.php &quot;Constitution Party Preamble&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Rick Jore]] of [[Montana]] became the first Constitution Party candidate elected to a state-level office,&lt;ref&gt;[http://sos.mt.gov/ELB/archives/2006/elections/general/house/hd12/index.asp &quot;State Legislature results&quot;], ''Missoulian'', November 8, 2006, retrieved November 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helenair.com/articles/2006/11/09/montana/a01110906_02.txt Control of state Legislature unclear], ''Helena Independent Record''&lt;/ref&gt; though the Constitution Party of Montana had disaffiliated itself from the national party a short time before the election.

The Constitution Party's 2008 presidential nominee was [[Chuck Baldwin]].

====Green Party====
{{Main|Green Party (United States)}}
In the [[United States]], the Green Party has been active as a [[third party (United States)|third party]] since the 1980s. The party first gained widespread public attention during [[Ralph Nader]]'s second presidential run in [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]]. Currently, the primary national Green Party organization in the U.S. is the '''Green Party of the United States''', which has eclipsed the earlier [[Greens/Green Party USA]].

The Green Party in the United States has won elected office mostly at the [[local government|local]] level; most winners of public office in the United States who are considered Greens have won [[nonpartisan]]-ballot elections (that is, elections in which the candidates' party affiliations were not printed on the [[ballot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feinstein.org/greenparty/electeds.html Green elected officials]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the Party had 305,000 registered members in states that allow party registration.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://web.greens.org/stats/ Green Party Ballot Status and Voter Registration Totals (United States)]&quot;. Greens.org. Retrieved April 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2006 elections the party had [[ballot access]] in 31 states.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.gp.org/press/pr_2006_09_05.shtml Greens Win Ballot Access in 31 States, Up From 17 in January]&quot;. Green Party press release, September 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greens emphasize [[environmentalism]], non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[participatory democracy]], [[social justice]], respect for [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]], [[peace]] and [[nonviolence]].

The 2008 Green Party presidential nominee was [[Cynthia McKinney]].

====Libertarian Party====
{{Main|Libertarian Party (United States)}}
The Libertarian Party was founded on December 11, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lp.org/organization/history.shtml Libertarian Party:Our History], LP.org&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the largest continuing [[third party (United States)|third parties]] in the United States, claiming more than 200,000 registered voters and more than 600 people in public office,&lt;ref name=&quot;lpfaq&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.lp.org/article_85.shtml Frequently asked questions about the Libertarian Party]&quot;, Official Website of the Libertarian National Committee. Retrieved on July 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[mayor]]s, county executives, county-council members, school-board members, and other local officials. It has more people in office than all other minor parties combined.&lt;ref name=&quot;lpfaq&quot;/&gt;
&lt;!-- &quot;How large is the Libertarian Party?
In terms of political activity (i.e., number of candidates, access to the ballot, and elected office holders), the Libertarian Party is the third-largest in America. We're active in all 50 states and have more than 200,000 registered voters.&quot; --&gt;

The [[political platform]] of the Libertarian Party reflects that group's particular brand of [[libertarianism]], favoring minimally regulated, ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, strong [[civil liberties]], minimally regulated [[open immigration|migration across borders]], and [[non-interventionism]] in foreign policy that respects [[Free trade|freedom of trade]] and travel to all foreign countries.

The 2008 Libertarian Party nominee for United States President was [[Bob Barr]].

===Politics comparison===
The following table lists some [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]] most often associated with the five U.S. political parties with the most members, as well the official party positions on a number of reformist [[Politicized issue|issues]] where positions diverge. Nuances may be found in the parties' respective [[party platform|platforms]].  It must be remembered that not all members of a party subscribe to all of its officially held positions, the usual degree of variation generally being higher for the larger parties.  Note that party members may hold different views on legislation to be enacted at the state or federal levelsâmost Libertarians{{Who|date=April 2011}}, for example, believe that the federal government has no proper role at all with regard to adult consumption of drugs, abortion, or marriages of any sort, but some believe that the several states have the right to legislate{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.
