'''''Spooks''''' is&lt;!-- Do not change to was per [[WP:MOS]]--&gt; a [[British television]] drama series that originally aired on [[BBC One]] from 13 May 2002 â 23 October 2011, consisting of 10 series. The title is a popular [[colloquialism]] for [[espionage|spies]], as the series follows the work of a group of [[MI5]] officers based at the service's [[Thames House]] headquarters, in a highly secure suite of offices known as The Grid. In the United States and France, the show is broadcast under the title '''''MI-5'''''. In Canada, the programme originally aired as ''MI5'' but now airs on [[BBC Canada]] as ''Spooks''.

The programme was created by writer [[David Wolstencroft]] and has attracted popular guest actors including [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Robert Hardy]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Bruce Payne]], [[Reece Dinsdale]], [[Ian McDiarmid]], [[Ewen Bremner]], [[Jimi Mistry]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Andrew Tiernan]], [[Anton Lesser]], [[Anupam Kher]], [[Alexander Siddig]], [[Martine McCutcheon]] and [[Anthony Head]].

It was announced in August 2011 that the show would end after the tenth series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/aug/11/bbc-spooks-axed &quot;Spooks Axed]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spooks003.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Matthew Macfadyen]] as Tom Quinn and [[David Oyelowo]] as Danny Hunter in Series One.]]
Starring [[Matthew Macfadyen]], [[Keeley Hawes]], [[David Oyelowo]], [[Jenny Agutter]], and [[Peter Firth]], the initial series of six one-hour episodes premiered in the spring of 2002.

Due to its combination of glossy high production values with fast-paced action/adventure and spy intrigue storylines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/series1.shtml Spooks â Series 1 Episode Guide] BBC Drama&lt;/ref&gt; the series was a critical and popular success, averaging 7.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers over its six episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Exact figure: 7.491666667, calculated from [[BARB]] figures for week ending 19 May 2002 and all subsequent weeks until 23 June 2002 [http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?Requesttimeout=500&amp;report=weeklyterrestrial Weekly Top 30 Programmes] BARB&lt;/ref&gt;

The second episode gained notoriety for the violent killing of character Helen Flynn ([[Lisa Faulkner]]), which drew the largest number of complaints to the [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;The Broadcasting Standards Commission receives 154 complaints after Helen Flynn's killing, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3073921.stm Spy show draws record complaints] BBC News, 17 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; During an undercover operation Helen and Tom were captured by race riot instigator Robert Osborne, played by [[Kevin McNally]], who tortured Helen with a [[deep fryer]] in an attempt to make Tom reveal classified information. He refused and she was killed. This provoked an angry reaction from many viewers who jammed BBC phone switchboards with complaints, despite the show airing after the [[Watershed (television)|9&amp;nbsp;pm watershed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/dozens-protest-to-bbc-over-horrific-death-scene-in-spooks-651933.html | work=The Independent | title=Dozens protest to BBC over horrific death scene in 'Spooks' | first=Paul | last=Peachey | date=22 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series 2===
{{Main|Spooks (series 2)}}
With the success of the first series, a second, longer series of ten episodes was commissioned and subsequently aired in 2003. New regular characters [[Sam Buxton]] ([[Shauna Macdonald]]) and [[Ruth Evershed]] ([[Nicola Walker]]), were introduced in the first and second episodes respectively, while the series finale ended with a dramatic [[cliffhanger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/series2.shtml Spooks â Series 2 Episode Guide] BBC Drama&lt;/ref&gt; The series averaged 7.1&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Exact figure: 7.097, calculated from [[BARB]] figures for week ending 8 June 2003 and all subsequent weeks until 17 August 2003 [http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?Requesttimeout=500&amp;report=weeklyterrestrial Weekly Top 30 Programmes] BARB&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series 3===
{{Main|Spooks (series 3)}}
A third series of ten episodes was transmitted on BBC One in the autumn of 2004 and concluded on 13 December. The first episode features [[Rupert Penry-Jones]] as [[Adam Carter]], who was drafted in from [[MI6]] to help investigate Tom's disappearance. He later takes over Tom's position as Section Chief after the latter jeopardised an important operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/series3.shtml Spooks â Series 3 â Episode Guide] BBC Drama, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode six, Zoe is taken to court for misconduct during an operation and is forced to leave MI5 and assume a new identity in Chile. She is replaced by Adam's wife, [[Fiona Carter|Fiona]] ([[Olga Sosnovska]]). In the series finale, Danny is killed while he and Fiona are being held hostage. Audience figures dropped to a series average of 5.8&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Exact figure: 5.771, calculated from [[BARB]] figures for week ending 17 October 2004 and all subsequent weeks until 19 December 2004 [http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?Requesttimeout=500&amp;report=weeklyterrestrial Weekly Top 30 Programmes] BARB&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series 4===
{{Main|Spooks (series 4)}}
The fourth series of ''Spooks'' began transmission on Monday 12 September 2005 on BBC One at 9&amp;nbsp;pm with the first of a two-part story. The next day (13 September) the second episode was shown. The following week ''Spooks'' assumed a 9&amp;nbsp;pm Thursday slot, a break from the Monday 9&amp;nbsp;pm slot the previous series had traditionally occupied. Once again, the series ran for ten episodes and averaged 6.05&amp;nbsp;million viewers, a notable increase on the previous series.&lt;ref&gt;Exact figure: 6.045, calculated from [[BARB]] figures for week ending 18 September 2005 and all subsequent weeks until 13 November 2005 [http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?Requesttimeout=500&amp;report=weeklyterrestrial Weekly Top 30 Programmes] BARB&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening two-part episode introduces two new characters to the series, Zafar Younis ([[Raza Jaffrey]], whose character had debuted in the final episode of series three), and Juliet Shaw ([[Anna Chancellor]]). The storyline involves a terrorist bombing central London, something that, in reality, took place on [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July]], two months prior to the airing but already after the filming was complete.

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, the day the first episode aired, &quot;The similarities were sufficient to cause head of drama [[Jane Tranter]] and new BBC One controller [[Peter Fincham]] to agonise over whether to drop the episodes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Owen ''[http://media.guardian.co.uk/mediaguardian/story/0,7558,1567550,00.html Spooky coincidences]'' &quot;The Guardian&quot;, 12 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes eventually aired unedited, although before both instalments of the two-parter the BBC One [[continuity announcer]] warned viewers that they featured scenes of terrorist bombing in London which some viewers might find disturbing.

In episode seven, Fiona Carter leaves the show because the actress portraying her, [[Olga Sosnovska]], was pregnant during filming and chose to leave the programme. In that story arc, Adam attempts to kill Fiona's deranged ex-husband, who she thought was hanged several years prior. However, her ex-husband ultimately abducts her and later shoots her dead in Adam's presence during her attempted escape. Her character is replaced by Jo Portman (played by [[Miranda Raison]]), a new arrival at MI5 who was recruited by Adam in a previous episode.

===Series 5===
{{Main|Spooks (series 5)}}
The fifth (10-part) series of ''Spooks'' aired its first episode in two parts, the first appearing on 17 September 2006. In it, elements within the British Government, MI6 and the UK press conspire in an attempt to overthrow the Parliament and the Prime Minister. These elements agree that for Britain to survive the threats posed by modern day terrorism, democracy had to be replaced with rule by committee. The second part followed the next day (18 September), marking ''Spooks&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' return to BBC One's Monday night schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/episodeguide.shtml Spooks â Episode Guide] BBC Drama, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  These episodes introduced Ros Myers ([[Hermione Norris]]).

This series' storylines include a fake home-grown [[Al-Qaeda]] cell that plans an attack on London; the British government selling nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia; and the US administration selling arms to African dictators.

The ratings for this series remained consistent with those of the previous series, averaging 6&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Exact figure: 5.968, calculated from [[BARB]] figures for week ending 17 September 2006 and all subsequent weeks until 19 November 2006 [http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?Requesttimeout=500&amp;report=weeklyterrestrial Weekly Top 30 Programmes] BARB&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series 6===
{{Main|Spooks (series 6)}}
The sixth series was commissioned by Jane Tranter, Head of Drama Commissioning at the BBC, by the time series 5 was announced. The series returned on 16 October 2007 at 9&amp;nbsp;pm on [[BBC One]], and concluded on 18 December.&lt;ref name=Home&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/ Spooks] BBC One&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/spooks/episodeguide.shtml Spooks â Series 6 Episode Guide] BBC Drama&lt;/ref&gt; The series averaged 5.68&amp;nbsp;million viewers (the lowest to date)&lt;ref&gt;Calculated from [[BARB]] figures for week ending 21 October 2007 and all subsequent weeks until 23 December 2007 [http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?Requesttimeout=500&amp;report=weeklyterrestrial Weekly Top 30 Programmes] BARB&lt;/ref&gt;
The sixth series was different in certain respects from the previous five because it had one storyline running right the way through it, and for the first time, the show contained end credits. There was also a less frequent use of the soundtrack composed by Jennie Muskett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jenniemuskett.com/ |title=JennieMuskett.com |publisher=JennieMuskett.com |accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary storyline of Series 6 follows Iran seeking the ability to manufacture its own nuclear weapons and searching for sellers of nuclear armaments components. The governments of several nations (principally the United States and its CIA, Russia's [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]], and a shadowy third organisation composed of disenfranchised members of other agencies, including MI5) are woven throughout the plot. [[Simon Abkarian]] plays the Iranian Special Counsel liaising with the various governments, Agni Scott as his wife, [[Matthew Marsh (actor)|Matthew Marsh]] as the CIA station chief, and [[Robert Glenister]] as the British Home Secretary, all have recurring roles throughout the series.

A new website called &quot;Spooks Interactive&quot; was created to coincide with the launch of the series.&lt;ref name=Home/&gt; In April 2008, the ''Spooks'' production team won the BAFTA Award for Interactivity for their work on Spooks Interactive.&lt;ref name=&quot;bafta1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/television/latest-winners-and-nominees,91,BA.html|title=TV Winners in 2008|date=18 March 2008|publisher=[[BAFTA]]|accessdate=12 November 2008|date=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Series 7===
{{Main|Spooks (series 7)}}
Series 7 of ''Spooks'' began airing on 27 October 2008 for an eight episode run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/wk44/unplaced.shtml#unplaced_spooks | title=Programme Information â Network TV Week 44 â Unplaced |work=BBC  Press Office | accessdate=8 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Firth]] returns as [[Harry Pearce]], along with [[Alex Lanipekun]] as [[Ben Kaplan]], [[Hugh Simon]] as [[Malcolm Wynn-Jones]], [[Miranda Raison]] as [[Jo Portman]] and [[Gemma Jones]] as [[Connie James]].

In the first episode, central character [[Adam Carter]] (portrayed by [[Rupert Penry Jones]]) dies in a car explosion set by terrorists, and the character [[Ros Myers]] (played by [[Hermione Norris]]) returns to the show as a deep-cover agent in Moscow. [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] joins the cast as [[Lucas North]], an agent who has been held in a Russian prison for the past eight years and released as part of a [[spy]] exchange. Following Adam's death, Ros is made the section leader and Lucas replaces her as a Senior Case officer.

The series 8 recommission press release stated there would be a twist in the final episode of series 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-series8&quot;/&gt; In this episode, a nuclear bomb is set to explode, triggered by a Russian sleeper agent who is part of Operation Tiresias. As Parliament and the Royal Family are evacuated, the nuclear threat to London is eliminated when Ros and Lucas are able to turn [[Connie James]] and elude an FSB kill squad. While defusing the bomb, Connie is killed by its conventional explosives. Seconds before the bomb exploded, Connie revealed that it had not been Harry who sold Lucas North out to the Russians as Lucas had always believed but, rather, herself. The episode concludes with Harry, conscious but with his mouth taped shut, in the boot of a car being zipped up in a body bag by Viktor Sarkisian, head of the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB's]] London station.

===Series 8===
{{Main|Spooks (series 8)}}
In December 2008, the BBC announced that series 8 would start filming in March 2009 and air late 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-series8&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title=BBC One announces return of hit drama Spooks as current series continues to garner critical acclaim | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/12_december/04/spooks.shtml |work=BBC  Press Office | date=4 December 2008| accessdate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; with both [[Hermione Norris]] ([[Ros Myers|Ros]]) and [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] ([[Lucas North|Lucas]]) returning for series 8. Series 8 started on Wednesday 4 November 2009, at 9&amp;nbsp;pm on BBC One,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2009/wk44/wed.shtml Network TV BBC Week 44: Wednesday 4 November 2009] BBC Press Office, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; with episode 2 broadcast on Friday 6 November at 9&amp;nbsp;pm on BBC Three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ntlnm Spooks â Series 8, Episode 2] BBC One&lt;/ref&gt; The opening episode of series 8 drew in 6&amp;nbsp;million viewers a 25% share of audience numbers between 9&amp;nbsp;pm and 10&amp;nbsp;pm.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The first episode of the series continues from the cliffhanger at the end of series 7, with [[Harry Pearce]] being held captive by the Russians. During this episode, [[Ruth Evershed]] is reintroduced, having spent her time since series 5 in Cyprus. The only character other than Harry who has been in the programme since its inception, [[Malcolm Wynn-Jones]] departs stating simply that he is &quot;too old&quot;. His replacement comes in the form of much younger technician [[Tariq Masood]] ([[Shazad Latif]]).

The series again revolves around one major plot-arc which is a mysterious organisation known only as &quot;Nightingale&quot;. During the course of the series, [[Lucas North]]'s loyalty is continually called into question, for the most part because of his ongoing relationship with CIA agent Sarah Caulfield who is connected to Nightingale. At the end of the series, Section D does not appear to have made much progress in tackling Nightingale, and [[Ros Myers]] is killed in an explosion with the new Home Secretary [[Andrew Lawrence (Spooks)|Andrew Lawrence]].

===Series 9===
{{Main|Spooks (series 9)}}
''Spooks'' returned for a ninth series on Monday 20 September 2010 for an eight-episode run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2010/wk38/ | title=Network TV Programme Information BBC Week 38 |work=BBC  Press Office | accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New cast members in this series include [[Sophia Myles]] and [[Max Brown]] as MI5 officers and [[Simon Russell Beale]] as the Home Secretary. [[Iain Glen]] and [[Laila Rouass]] also joined the series, playing [[Vaughn Edwards]] and Maya Lahan â figures from Lucas's mysterious past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1670824/fullcredits#cast Full cast and crew for &quot;Spooks&quot; (2010)] Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt;

The season ends with the deaths of Lucas' lover Maya Lahan, following the death of Lucas' blackmailer, Vaughn, in the climactic end of the penultimate episode. Lucas had kidnapped Ruth, binding and gagging her, and was attempting to get a top-secret computer file for the Chinese. The climactic scene was a showdown between Harry and Lucas on top of a tower block in London. After Harry reveals that the file never actually worked, and that Lucas had apparently betrayed his MI5 colleagues and stolen another man's identity, &quot;Lucas&quot; (apparently &quot;real&quot; name John Bateman) orders Harry to turn around. Harry anticipates execution, but no shots come. Hearing a car alarm and screams from the ground many seconds later, Harry turns around to find Lucas no longer on the roof.  Forty-eight hours later, the Home Secretary calls Harry to inform him that a full investigation will be made into his actions at MI5 and to &quot;prepare for life after MI5.&quot; The series ends with Harry looking out over the London skyline at night. A caption reveals that a 10th series would be shown in 2011.

===Series 10===
{{Main|Spooks (series 10)}}
At the end of Series 9, a teaser screen announced that the programme would return for a tenth series in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i680.photobucket.com/albums/vv162/TangerineUK/129775.jpg ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sophia Myles]] did not return as Beth Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gEXdxT6c5pH3RLdhac1vfxOJWshA?docId=N0330221301577404759A &quot;Pulver lands boss role on Spooks&quot; â Press Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

The season concludes with the revelation of a plot to force Britain and Russia into war. Harry managed to thwart the plot and decides to leave the service to live a normal life with Ruth Evershed. However, a vengeful Sasha Gavrik attempts to have revenge on him and Ruth takes the blow for him before dying in his arms. Harry then decides to return to MI5, the prospect of a normal life no longer being accessible to him.

Kudos and the BBC announced in a joint statement in  August 2011 that Series 10 would be the last series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/aug/11/bbc-spooks-axed &quot;Spooks Axed]&lt;/ref&gt; It began airing on BBC One on Sunday September 18, 2011 at 9:00 pm, moving from its traditional weekday evening slot&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/sep/07/bbc-spooks-downton-abbey &quot;BBC sets up Spooks v Downton Abbey battle&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;, with the final episode airing on October 23, 2011.

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of Spooks episodes}}
Including the final (tenth) series, the show consists of 86 episodes. ''Spooks'' series 10 started transmission on 18 September 2011.

Each episode begins with a &quot;previously&quot; sequence, recapping recent events. Following a teaser, setting up the episode's narrative, a title sequence runs, featuring the main characters but no actor credits, and ends with the name of the series. Each episode ends with the final scene freezing and changing to a black-and-white negative image that then compresses with a distinctive sound effect into a flat white line against a black screen. With the exception of each season finale, a trailer for the next episode is shown, followed by the Kudos and BBC logos. The series airs with no credits on [[BBC One]] to maintain an atmosphere of the anonymity of real-life spies and the drama of each episode. Full credits are available online.

Prior to Series 9, the subsequent episode was aired on [[BBC Three]] one week ahead of its BBC One showing (the first and last episode were only shown on [[BBC One]]). BBC Three airings included a brief credit sequence following the trailer and before the Kudos and BBC logos.

==Music==

The music for series 1 to 4 and theme tune was composed by Jennie Muskett. Music for series 5 to 10 was composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan. Four soundtracks have been released for the show, the first includes music from series 1 &amp; 2, the second (currently and perhaps only ever available on iTunes) featuring music from series 5 &amp; 6. Track listings for the latter contain spoilers to the episode content. Two additional tracks are available on the composer's website. The third and fourth soundtracks (containing tracks from series 7 &amp; 8, and 9 &amp; 10 respectively) were released on iTunes in November 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;spooks7itunes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/spooks-series-7-8/id482925275 |title=Spooks: Series 7 &amp; 8 |last=Leonard-Morgan|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Leonard-Morgan |date={{date|24 November 2011}} |work= |publisher=Kudos Film and Television Ltd|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spooks9itunes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/spooks-series-9-10/id482937181 |title=Spooks: Series 9 &amp; 10|last=Leonard-Morgan|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Leonard-Morgan|date={{date|24 November 2011}} |work= |publisher=Kudos Film and Television Ltd|accessdate=26 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcast editions of the episodes have been known to feature alternate music to that found on the commercially available DVD releases. In the final episode of Series 2, music from the film score ''[[Spy Game]]'' was usedâcomposed by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]]. The tracks used are &quot;Beirut, a War Zone&quot; and &quot;Operation Dinner Out&quot;. Both are available on the official soundtrack release for the film.

==International broadcasts and DVD sales==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}
All of the programmes were filmed on Super 16 and are not available in HD/Blu-ray.&lt;ref&gt;episode 1 series 8 DVD director/producer commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The following list would probably work better in a table --&gt;
In the United States, the commercial-free and viewer-supported [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) began airing the show under the title ''MI-5'' in January 2009, beginning with Series 1. For the first time, the episodes are being broadcast full-length and in widescreen (1.78:1) format. This is the third network to attempt a successful airing of the show. Series 1 â 4 were broadcast on cable channel [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] from 2003 to 2006, however ratings were poor, and after a marathon showing of Series 4, the show was removed from the schedule. In 2007 and 2008, [[BBC America]] aired ''MI-5'', withdrawing the show from its schedule mid-Series 4, again a victim of ratings. Due to the need to insert commercial breaks, the episodes broadcast on commercial stations (A&amp;E and BBC America) in the U.S. were edited for time, with each 59-minute installment edited down to roughly 45 minutes, and were presented in full screen (1.33:1) format. The full-length episodes were broadcast on some cable &quot;On Demand&quot; services and are available on DVD.

In Canada the series was also screened uncut and unedited on [[BBC Canada]], a speciality digital cable channel, under its original BBC title ''Spooks''. However, this was stopped after Series 3 because the U.S. A&amp;E channel had exclusive rights to future viewings in Canada and was showing the episodes as well. Since then, BBC Canada has resumed showing the series and began showing Series 5 to Canadian viewers on 26 August 2007.

BBC shows ''Spooks'' on its entertainment channel [[BBC Prime]] in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The programme is also aired as ''Spooks'' in Australia and New Zealand on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] and [[Television New Zealand|TVNZ]] respectively.
