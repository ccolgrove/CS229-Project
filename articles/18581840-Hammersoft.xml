'''David Armstrong''' is a photographer based out of [[New York]]. 

==Personal Life==
Armstrong was born in 1954, in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]]. He is openly homosexual, and uses this in his photography.

==Career==
Armstrong first received critical attention for his intimate portraits of men, either lovers or friends, in sharp focus.&lt;ref&gt;David Armstrong, &quot;The Silver Cord&quot;, (New York: Scalo, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineties, he began to photograph cityscapes and landscapes in [[soft focus]] to contrast with the resolution of his portraits. Street lights, electric signs and cars are reduced to a sensual mottled blur, complementing the vividness and tactility of his portraits.{{Whom?|date=August 2010}} His photographs have been included in numerous group exhibitions including the 1995 Whitney Biennial &lt;ref&gt;''Whitney Biennial'', (New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and Emotions and Relations at the Hamburger Kunsthalle.
