The '''Miami Metrorail''', officially '''Metrorail''' and commonly called the '''Metro''', is the [[heavy rail]] [[rapid transit]] system of [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], serving the [[South Florida metropolitan area|Miami metropolitan area]]. The Metro is operated by [[Miami-Dade Transit]], a departmental agency of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]]. Opened in 1984, it is Florida's only rapid transit metro system, and is currently composed of {{convert|22.4|mi|km}} line with 22 stations.

The Metro serves the [[urban area|urban core]] of Miami, connecting the [[central business district]]s of [[Downtown Miami]], [[Brickell]] and the [[Civic Center (Miami)|Civic Center]] with the Greater Miami neighborhoods of [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]] and [[Medley, Florida|Medley]] to the northwest, and to [[Coconut Grove]], [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]], ending at [[Dadeland, Florida|Dadeland]] in suburban [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]]. The Metro connects to the [[Metromover]] in Downtown, which provides metro service to the entirety of Downtown. The Metro has seen increased [[ridership]] growth over the years, with an average daily ridership of 65,300 passengers, {{asof|2011|2|lc=y}} (96,000, including [[Metromover]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/news_technical_reports_archive.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Metro will open its 23rd station, [[Miami Central Station]], at [[Miami International Airport]] (MIA), opening a 16-station re-branded Orange Line between the MIA and [[Dadeland South (Metrorail station)|Dadeland South]] stations. The new line is expected to increase ridership significantly, adding millions of riders per year,&lt;ref&gt;http://miamidade.gov/wps/PA_1_TC5RNSJDM7JC0027AB79NQ10L5/ondemand_view.jsp?itemid=292647&amp;play=HiRes&lt;/ref&gt; and allowing residents and visitors alike direct access from the MIA to [[Downtown Miami]], and greater connectivity between various modes of transit throughout Miami-Dade County. Central Station will provide direct service to [[Amtrak]] [[inter-city rail]] services, [[Tri-Rail]] [[commuter rail]], [[Greyhound Lines]] intercity bus, and the [[Miami Intermodal Center|Rental Car Center]]. Miami Central Station is expected to attract 150,000 daily commuters and travellers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dsiamerica.com/references/commercial-buildings/modern-transportation-hub-at-miami-airport-usa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Metro is one of only two [[List of United States rapid transit systems|rapid transit]] systems in the [[Southeastern United States]] (the other system being [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] in [[Atlanta]]).

==History==
[[Image:Metrorail construction.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Metrorail viaduct under construction along [[South Dixie Highway|South Dixie Highway (US 1)]] in [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] during the early 1980s.]]
In 1971, a study completed by the Miami Urban Area Transportation Study (MUATS) recommended the construction for a rapid transit system for the [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|county]]; having experienced a prolonged post-[[World War II]] population boom, metropolitan Dade County's permanent population rose by 35% to nearly 1.3 million residents within a decade, among the fastest population growth rates in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.censusscope.org/us/s12/c86/chart_popl.html&lt;/ref&gt; Within a year of the study, county residents approved a $132.5 million (${{Inflation|US|132.5|1972|r=1}} million, adjusted for current inflation) [[municipal bond|bond]] dedicated to transit, with additional funding approved by the [[Florida Legislature]] for transit which, up until that time, operated solely on fare revenue. In 1976, with preliminary engineering completed for the system, the [[Federal Transit Administration]] (FTA, then, the Urban Mass Transit Administration) committed 80% of the costs for the first stage of rapid transit system, with the county and state incurring the remaining cost. 

In April 1979, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] ratified an agreement between the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] (FEC) and Dade County to transfer the then-FEC [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] along [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|US 1]] to Miami-Dade Transit, then named the Metro Transit Agency (MTA), with [[groundbreaking]] for the system the [[county commission]] voted to be named &quot;Metrorail&quot; taking place at the site of what would become University Station in June. Construction began in December 1980 with placing of a double-tee guideway [[girder]] near the [[University of Miami]]. In June 1983, the first segment of Metrorail from Dadeland South to Overtown (now &quot;Historic Overtown/[[Lyric Theater (Miami, Florida)|Lyric Theatre]]&quot;) was completed with the construction of the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] bridge, with free first-day service from [[Pinecrest, Florida|Pinecrest]] to Overtown commencing May 20, 1984 with over 125,000 riders. 

Additional segments opened subsequently in December 1984 between Earlington Heights and Okeechobee stations in May 1985. In March 1989, temporary station was opened to provide a connection to the newly-opened [[Tri-Rail]] [[commuter rail]] line, with the station officially opening in June of that year. Preliminary engineering for a rapid transit extension to the [[Florida State Road 826|Palmetto Expressway]] began in 1996 with Palmetto station opening in May 2003. Revenues expected for 2006 were $17.15 million.  Expenses budgeted for 2006 were $41.29 million. These historic figures became the last the Miami Dade Transit Authority ever disclosed, and in fact are the figures still displayed in today's Miami-Dade Transit webpage as of July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/about_metrorail.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on Metrorail's 23rd station at the [[Miami Central Station]] at [[Miami International Airport]] began in May 2009, with service projected to begin in late 2011/early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/corridor/mic-e_corridor/mic-e_home.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamiherald.com/460/story/1028513.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Train and track information==
{{Metrorail (Miami)}}
[[File:Metro um.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Metro train entering [[University (Metrorail station)|University Station]]]]
[[File:Metrorail Orange Line map.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The new Metro maps with the new Orange Line. As of November 2011, these new signs are being installed in all stations. All signs in the stations are being updated from the old green color to a neutral grey to allow for both lines at stations.]]
Metrorail runs from the northwest in [[Medley, Florida|Medley]] through [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], into the city of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], the downtown area, through [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] and [[South Miami, Florida|South Miami]], and ending in southwest Miami-Dade at Dadeland Mall. There are 22 [[Accessibility|accessible]] Metrorail stations, one about every 1.25 miles (or 1.9 kilometers).  Metrorail connects to the [[Metromover]] system at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]] and [[Brickell (changeover station)|Brickell]] stations and to [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]]'s [[Tri-Rail]] suburban system at the [[Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station|Tri-Rail Station]] (see below).

Trains are stored at the Palmetto Yard just west of Okeechobee Station. The yard houses 136 cars built by the [[Budd Company]]; Miami-Dade's subway cars were among the last orders Budd filled before shuttering its railcar manufacturing business. The cars are identical to those used on the [[Metro Subway (Baltimore)|Baltimore Metro]] (save for the modifications made to Baltimore's cars during their refurbishment in 2005), as the two systems were built at the same time, and the two agencies were able to save money by sharing a single order.

The cars are operated in 2-car units, and joined up to form 6-car trains, which is the normal train length. For the 10-minute interval peak time service (2011 schedule), 12 such trains are required, the journey takes 50 minutes from end to end, with a 10 minute standing time at each end. Therefore 72 cars are required for the daily service. It will be seen that the 136 cars built for the system were therefore a considerable overprovision. For the 15-minute interval weekday daytime service, 7 trains are required, and 5 trains are thus stored after each rush period. Only four trains are used to provide the weekday evening 30-minute service. All trains are scheduled to run from end to end of the route.

Along the Metrorail system, the tracks are mostly elevated. Three sections are not: under I-95 between Vizcaya and Brickell stations, under I-95 just east of Culmer station, and from just east of the Palmetto Expressway heading west into the Palmetto station and tail track. In each of these cases, the tracks ride on ground level for a brief amount of time.

The platform at each Metrorail station is long enough to accommodate six-car-long trains; the Dadeland North, Earlington Heights, and Government Center station platforms are long enough to accommodate eight-car-long trains.  In-service trains are usually either four or six cars long; in the evening it is not uncommon for Miami-Dade Transit to link two out-of-service trains together before returning them to Palmetto Yard.

==Fares and service==
[[File:Empty Metrorail car.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Inside a Metro car]]
The current standard fare on Metrorail is $2 and reduced fare is $1. A standard [[season ticket|monthly pass]] costs $100 and $50 for reduced fare. The monthly EASY Cards are sold at over 50 sales outlets. Reduced fares are available only to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] recipients, people with [[disability|disabilities]], and Miami-Dade students in grades 1-12. [[Ticket machine|Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs)]] that sell EASY Cards and EASY Tickets are found in all rail stations. All Miami-Dade [[senior citizen]]s aged 65 years and older and with [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, and [[Veteran]]s residing in Miami-Dade and earning less than $22,000 annually ride free with the reduced fare monthly EASY Card. All of the stations except the five in the downtown area have dedicated parking available.

On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit announced that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the [[EASY Card (South Florida)|EASY Card]] system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash-/token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail [[fare gate]]s from a reloadable card.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/advisories/08-07-14-easy_card_google.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://miamidade.gov/wps/PA_1_TC5RNSJDM7JC0027AB79NQ10L5/ondemand_view.jsp?itemid=47503&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/library/pdfs/misc/easy_card_brochure011209.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/library/pdfs/misc/govt_center_easyc_fcs_install_flyer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers utilizing Metrorail '''must''' use either an EASY Card or EASY Ticket to enter stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamidade.gov/transit/library/easy_card/conga_line_letter_size.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Metrorail runs from 5 a.m. until [[midnight]] seven days a week. Trains arrive every 8 minutes during weekday [[rush hour]]s, every 15 minutes at [[noon|midday]], and every 15â30 minutes after 6 p.m. until midnight. [[Workweek|Weekend]] service runs every 30 minutes until midnight. For a brief period from 2003 to April 2004 there was 24-hour service; between midnight and 5 a.m., trains arrived every 60 minutes.

A [[limited-stop]] bus route, Route 500 Midnight Owl, operates hourly between 12:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. trip between Dadeland South and Government Center Metrorail stations.  This bus service replaces the 24-hour Metrorail service cancelled due to a lack of ridership.

Construction on the first segment of the Orange Line, Metrorail's AirportLink&lt;ref&gt;http://www.progressiverailroading.com/news/article.asp?id=23605&lt;/ref&gt; began in June 2009; service to [[Miami International Airport]] is scheduled to begin in spring [[2012 in rail transport|2012]].

The Miami-Dade County Government is working with the Citizens Independent Transportation Trust to receive money from the half-penny sur-tax approved by voters in 2002 in order to purchase new Metrorail cars.
