'''''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit''''' (often abbreviated to '''''Law &amp; Order: SVU''''' or just '''''SVU''''') is an American [[police procedural]] television drama series set in New York City, where it is also primarily produced. Created and [[Executive producer#Motion pictures and television|produced]] by [[Dick Wolf]] and airing on [[NBC]], the series premiered on September 20, 1999 as the first spin-off of Wolf's successful crime drama, ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''. The show began airing its 13th season in September 2011 and has aired 281 episodes to date.  

''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' originally centered almost exclusively around the detectives of the [[Special Victims Unit]] in a fictional version of the 16th Precinct of the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD). In the style of the original ''Law &amp; Order'', episodes are often &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; or loosely based on real crimes that have received media attention. During the first twelve seasons, the show starred [[Christopher Meloni]] as Detective [[Elliot Stabler]] and [[Mariska Hargitay]] as Detective [[Olivia Benson]]. As the series progressed, additional supporting characters were added as allies of the detectives in the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the Medical Examiner's office. Typical episodes follow the detectives and their colleagues as they investigate and prosecute [[Sex and the law|sexually based offenses]].

''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' has been nominated for and won numerous awards, including the 2006 [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]] for Hargitay, the first Emmy to be received by a regular on any ''Law &amp; Order'' series.

Another Rob Dougan track - &quot;There's Only Me&quot;, is used as the theme for ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyc2ImJ8RtI]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the twelfth season,  Meloni left the series after he was unable to come to an agreement on his contract. Though Hargitay will continue her role as Detective Benson in all twenty-two episodes of season thirteen, she asked for a lighter workload.&lt;ref name=NBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick Wolf Uncensored|url=http://www.nbc.com/law-and-order-special-victims-unit/video/dick-wolf-uncensored/1356626|publisher=NBC|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of season thirteen, [[Danny Pino]] and [[Kelli Giddish]] joined the cast as new lead Detectives [[Nick Amaro]] and [[Amanda Rollins]] respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;MeloniExit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/05/chris-meloni-exits-law-order-svu/|title=Exclusive: Chris Meloni Exits Law &amp; Order: SVU|last=Webb Mitovich|first=Matt|last2=Ausiello|first2=|authorlink2=Michael Ausiello|work=TVLine|publisher=Mail.com Media|date={{nowrap|May 24}}, 2011|accessdate={{nowrap|May 24}}, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvline.com/2011/08/chris-meloni-law-order-svu-exit/|title=NBC on  Chris Meloni's Law &amp; Order: SVU Exit: We're Not Killing Him Off|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|work=[[TVLine]]|date={{nowrap|August 1}}, 2011|accessdate={{nowrap|August 10}}, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GiddishandPino&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidman|first=Robert|title=NBC Signs Kelli Giddish (''Chase'') and Danny Pino (''Cold Case'') as New Detectives for ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit''|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/27/nbc-signs-kelli-giddish-chase-and-danny-pino-cold-case-as-new-detectives-for-law-order-special-victims-unit/96694/|work=TV by the Numbers|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
=== History and development ===
The idea for ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' originated with the 1986 &quot;preppie murder&quot; case of [[Robert Emmet Chambers|Robert Chambers]], who strangled [[Jennifer Levin]], a woman he dated who he later killed during what he claimed was [[consensual]] &quot;[[rough sex]]&quot; in Manhattan's [[Central Park]]. The crime inspired [[Dick Wolf]] to write the story for the [[List of Law &amp; Order episodes (season 1)|season one]] episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' titled &quot;[[Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die (Law &amp; Order)|Kiss the Girls and Make them Die]]&quot;. Even after writing the episode, however, the case continued to haunt Wolf, who wanted to go deeper into the psychology of crimes to examine the role of human sexuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 2&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/ref&gt;

The original title of the show was ''Sex Crimes'', reflecting the sexual nature of the crimes depicted on the show. Initially there was concern among the producers that, should ''Sex Crimes'' fail, identifying the new show with the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise could hurt the original show. Additionally, [[Ted Kotcheff]] wanted to create a new series that was not dependent upon the original series for success. Wolf felt, however, that it was important and commercially desirable to have &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in the title, and he initially proposed the title of the show be ''Law &amp; Order: Sex Crimes''. [[Barry Diller]], then head of [[Studios USA]], was concerned about the title, however, and it was changed to ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' to reflect the actual unit of the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) that handles sexually based offenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 10-11&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;10â11&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode, &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 1)|Payback]]&quot;, premiered on NBC on September 20, 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 187&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;187&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive producer [[Neal Baer]] left ''Law &amp; Order: SVU'' as show-runner at the end of the [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)|twelfth season]], after eleven years (seasons 2â12) on the show as show-runner, in order to sign a three-year deal with [[CBS Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Nellie | last=Andreeva | title='Law &amp; Order: SVU' Show-runner Neal Baer Signs Big Overall Deal With CBS TV Studios | date=2010-11-23 | url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/11/law-order-svu-showrunner-nael-bear-signs-big-overall-deal-with-cbs-tv-studios/|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baer will be replaced by former ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' executive producer/show-runner [[Warren Leight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Michael | last=Ausiello | title=Scoop: NBC Taps New Law &amp; Order: SVU Boss

===Filming===
[[Image:Law&amp;OrderSVUFilmingatnightinCentralPark.jpg|thumb|350px|left|''SVU'' shooting on location in [[Central Park]] at night]]

Many exterior scenes of ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' are filmed on location in New York City, Dick Wolf's hometown, throughout all five of [[Borough (New York City)|New York City's boroughs]]. As the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] encounters varied law enforcement challenges on a daily basis, the backdrop provides the writers a supply of ideal locations to choose from.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 2-3&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;2â3&lt;/ref&gt;

When searching for a place to film the interiors of the show, the producers discovered that there were no suitable studio spaces available in New York City. As a result, a space was chosen at NBC's Central Archives building in nearby [[North Bergen, New Jersey]], which had sat empty for some time, and featured air-conditioning, adequate parking, and {{convert|53000|sqft|m2}} of stage area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 14&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt; The Archives building was used for police station and courtroom scenes,&lt;ref name=Kimpton&gt;Kimpton, Roger. &quot;Hollywood on the Palisades&quot;; ''Palisade'' magazine; Summer 2010; Pages 12-15&lt;/ref&gt; with various other locations in [[Hudson County]] used for other scenes, such as a scene shot at the Meadowlands Parkway in [[Secaucus]] in 2010. The production left New Jersey for New York in 2010, however, when New Jersey Governor [[Chris Christie]] suspended the tax credits for film and television production for the Fiscal Year 2011 to close budget gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, E. Assata. &quot;Getting the film crews back to NJ&quot;, ''[[The Union City Reporter]]'', February 13, 2011, pages 5 and 7&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] serves as the filming location for Detective [[Elliot Stabler]]'s residence in [[Queens, New York]].&lt;ref name=Kimpton/&gt;

===Broadcast history===
The show originally aired on Monday nights at 9:00 p.m. ET for the first nine episodes, from September 20 through November 29, 1999. It was then shifted to Friday nights at 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET on January 7, 2000, and remained in that time slot through the end of season four on May 16, 2003. Beginning with the season five premiere on September 23, 2003, ''SVU'' moved to Tuesday nights at 10:00 p.m. ET and occasionally has run previous shows on Saturday nights at 10:00 p.m. ET. The [[USA Network]] also runs previous episodes on weekday afternoons, generally in a block from 3 to 5 p.m. ET.

The series vacated its Tuesday 10 p.m. ET slot in fall 2009 when NBC began a prime-time weeknight [[Jay Leno]] series. ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' was moved to Wednesday nights at 9:00 p.m. ET on NBC, while CTV still airs ''SVU'' on Tuesdays at 10:00 in Canada. The eleventh season premiered its new time slot on September 23, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/FallTV-NBC-premieres-1007251.aspx|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|title=Fall TV: NBC Announces Premiere Dates|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] on March 3, 2010, ''SVU'' returned to its previous time slot of 10 p.m. ET, although on Wednesdays rather than Tuesdays as it had previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3ie77b4ee401b87ca182697be7b448ad25 | title= NBC firms up post-'Leno' schedule | author=Hibberd, James | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date= January 10, 2010 | accessdate= January 22, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of ''SVU's'' [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)|twelfth season]], it remains on Wednesday nights, but moved to 9:00 pm again for the fall; the season began on September 22, 2010, with a two-hour episode airing from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Breaking News - NBC ANNOUNCES UPDATED FALL SCHEDULE PREMIERES | date=2010-07-30 | url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/07/30/nbc-announces-updated-fall-schedule-premieres/20100730nbc02/ | work=The Futon Critic | accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January, with a two-hour mid-season premiere, ''SVU'' moved back to 10:00 pm.  CTV still airs ''SVU'' on Wednesday nights, but at 9:00 p.m.

==Casting and characters==

[[File:Law &amp; order svu new title card nbc may 2011.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay starred in ''Law &amp; Order: SVU'' for the first 12 years together.]]

Casting for the lead characters of ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' occurred in the spring of 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at [[Rockefeller Center]]. The last round had been narrowed down to six finalists. For the female lead, Detective [[Olivia Benson]], actresses [[Samantha Mathis]], [[Reiko Aylesworth]], and [[Mariska Hargitay]] were being considered. For the male role, Detective [[Elliot Stabler]], the finalists were [[Tim Matheson]], [[John Slattery]], [[Nick Chinlund]], and [[Christopher Meloni]]. Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and, after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, &quot;Oh well. There's no doubt who we should chooseâHargitay and Meloni.&quot; Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together, and they ended up being his first choice. [[Garth Ancier]], then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 11&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;  Eleven years after being cast, the two actors had become among the highest-paid lead actors on a drama, with each earning nearly $400,000 per episode, a salary that ''[[TV Guide]]'' said was exceeded only by ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'''s [[Hugh Laurie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tvguide.com/News/Top-TV-Earners-1021717.aspx |title= Who Are TV's Top Earners? |author= Stephen Battaglio |date=August 10, 2010|publisher=[[TV Guide]] | accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first actor to be cast for the show was [[Dann Florek]]. Florek had originated the character of [[Donald Cragen|Don Cragen]] in the 1988 pilot for ''Law &amp; Order'' and played the character for the first three seasons of the show until he was fired on the orders of network executives, who wanted to add female characters to the all male primary cast. He maintained a friendly relationship with Wolf, however, and went on to direct three episodes of the original series as well as to occasionally guest star on the show. Shortly after Florek reprised his role for ''[[Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie]]'', he received a call to be on ''Sex Crimes''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 145-146&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;145â146&lt;/ref&gt; Initially reluctant, he eventually agreed to star on the show as Cragen on the assurance that he would not be asked to audition for the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 13&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', [[Richard Belzer]] heard that [[Benjamin Bratt]] had left ''Law &amp; Order''. Belzer called his manager and instructed his manager to call Wolf and pitch the idea for Belzer's character from ''Homicide'', [[John Munch]], to become [[Lennie Briscoe]]'s new partner since they had previously teamed in three ''Homicide'' crossovers. Wolf loved the idea, but had already cast [[Jesse L. Martin]] as Briscoe's new partner. The idea was reconfigured, however, to have Munch on ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 13&quot; /&gt; Since the character of Munch was created by [[David Simon]] and adapted for ''Homicide'' by [[Tom Fontana]] and [[Barry Levinson]], the addition of Munch to the cast required the consent of all three. The appropriate agreements were reached and, while Fontana and Levinson agreed to waive their royalty rights, contracts with Simon required that he be paid royalties for any new show that Munch is a main character in; as a result, Simon receives royalties every time Munch appears in an episode of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 150&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dean Winters]] was cast as Munch's partner, [[Brian Cassidy]], at the insistence of Belzer. Belzer looked at Winters as a sort of little brother, and told Wolf, &quot;Well, I'll do this new show of yours, ''SVU'', only if you make Dean Winters my partner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 13&quot; /&gt; Wolf did make Winters Belzer's partner, but he was contractually obligated to his other show at the time, the [[HBO]] drama ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]''. Since the role on ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' was only initially meant to be a few episodes, Winters was forced to leave when it was time to film ''Oz'' again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 157&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), p.&amp;nbsp;157&lt;/ref&gt; The void left by Winters' departure was filled for the remainder of the season by [[Michelle Hurd]] as Detective [[Monique Jefferies]], a character who Wolf promised that, despite starting out as a minor character with one scene in the pilot, would eventually develop. The character did not develop, however, and doubts surfaced about whether Jefferies was the right character to be Munch's permanent partner. Hurd left the show at the beginning of the second season to join the cast of ''[[Leap Years]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 154-156&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;154â156&lt;/ref&gt; Munch's permanent partner came in the form of [[rapping|rapper]]-turned-actor [[Ice-T]], who had previously worked with Wolf on ''[[New York Undercover]]'' and ''[[Exiled: A Law &amp; Order Movie|Exiled]]''. Ice-T originally agreed to do only four episodes of ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', but he quickly gained affection for the ensemble nature of the cast. He relocated to New York City before his four-episode contract was up and remained with the show as Munch's permanent partner, Detective [[Fin Tutuola|Odafin &quot;Fin&quot; Tutuola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 152-154&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;152â154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephanie March]] had little television experience before being cast on ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', nor did she watch much TV. Nevertheless, March was cast as Assistant District Attorney [[Alexandra Cabot]] at the beginning of season two but still believed that, due to the grim nature of the series, it would be short-lived. She stayed with the series for three seasons, however, and left when she believed she had reached the natural conclusion of the character's development. She would later reprise the character as a guest appearance in the sixth season and as a regular character on the short-lived Wolf series, ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'', where she was promised more to do. [[Diane Neal]] had previously guest starred on ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' in the third season before being cast as Cabot's replacement, [[Casey Novak]], in the fifth season. Neal remained with the show through the end of the ninth season,&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 167-169&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;167â169&lt;/ref&gt; after which she was replaced by [[Michaela McManus]]. March returned to the show in the tenth season (after McManus' departure from the cast) when [[Neal Baer]] proposed Cabot receive a character arc to revitalize the second part of the season, which would continue through season eleven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 165-166&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;165â166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ten&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Mickey|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/SVU-News-Mariska-1007513.aspx|title=SVU News: Mariska and Meloni Are In For Season 11, and So Is Christine Lahti|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tamara Tunie]] was cast as [[Medical Examiner]] [[Melinda Warner]] in season two after working with Wolf previously on ''[[New York Undercover]]'', ''[[Feds (TV series)|Feds]]'', and ''Law &amp; Order''. Warner was initially a [[recurring character]] but became a regular character in the seventh season, and Tunie was added to the opening credits at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 172-173&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;172â173&lt;/ref&gt; When initially cast as Warner, Tunie was appearing as attorney Jessica Griffin on the [[CBS]] daytime [[soap opera]] ''[[As the World Turns]]''.  From 2000 to 2007 (and again briefly in 2009), she appeared on both series simultaneously.  In 2002, she also appeared on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] espionage-themed drama series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', in the recurring role of CTU Acting Director Alberta Green.  [[B. D. Wong]] was asked to film four episodes as Dr. [[George Huang (Law &amp; Order)|George Huang]], a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) [[forensic psychiatrist]] and [[criminal profiler]] on loan to the Special Victims Unit. After his four episodes, he was asked to stay on with the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 175-176&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;175â176&lt;/ref&gt;

After he starred in ''[[Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (film)|Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee]]'' and guest starred as Detective [[Detective Chester Lake|Chester Lake]] in the eighth season, Wolf felt that [[Adam Beach]] would be a good addition to the cast and asked him to be a permanent member beginning with the ninth season. Although Beach felt the role was a &quot;dream role&quot;, the character proved unpopular with fans who felt that he was designed to gradually write out either Richard Belzer or Ice-T and, feeling there were too many police characters on the show, Beach left the show after only one season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 160-162&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;160â162&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michaela McManus]] was originally felt to be too young for the role of an [[Assistant District Attorney]] (ADA) before being cast as ADA [[Kim Greylek]] in the show's tenth season. McManus remained with the series only half a season, however, before departing for unspecified reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green and Dawn 170-171&quot;&gt;Green and Dawn (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;170â171&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paula Patton]] joined the main cast as [[List of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit characters#Assistant District Attorneys|A.D.A. Mikka Von]]. She replaced [[Stephanie March]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGuidePattonADAVon&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Paula-Patton-SVU-1020796.aspx|title=Precious Star Paula Patton Is Law &amp; Order: SVU's New ADA|last=O'Connor|first=Mickey|work=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=''[[TV Guide]]''|date=July 21, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Patton dropped out after one episode to film ''[[Mission: Impossible â Ghost Protocol]]'', and was replaced by [[Melissa Sagemiller]] in the recurring role of [[Gillian Hardwicke|A.D.A.

''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' focuses on crimes of a sexual nature. While the victim is often murdered, this is not always the case, and victims often play prominent roles in episodes. The series frequently uses stories that are &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; or based on real crimes. Such episodes take a real crime and fictionalize it by changing the details.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR 2009-09-29&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| first=Neal | last=Conan | authorlink= Neal_Conan | title= 'Law &amp; Order' Writer Turns Headlines Into TV | date=2009-09-29 | url =http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113308543 | work = [[Talk of the Nation]] | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | accessdate = 2009-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
