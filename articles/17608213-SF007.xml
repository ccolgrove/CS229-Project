'''''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[stealth game]], developed and published by [[Ubisoft Shanghai]], while [[Ubisoft Montreal]], creator of the original ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (video game)|Splinter Cell]]'', was working on ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory|Chaos Theory]]''. ''Pandora Tomorrow'' is the second game in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell|Splinter Cell]]'' series endorsed by writer [[Tom Clancy]]. The game follows the covert activities of [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam Fisher]], an agent working for a black-ops branch of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) called &quot;Third Echelon&quot;. The character, Sam Fisher, is voiced by [[Michael Ironside]]. [[Dennis Haysbert]], at that time best known for his role as [[David Palmer (character)|David Palmer]] on the television show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' is the voice for the character Irving Lambert, Fisher's boss, making this the only time he is not voiced by Don Jordan. [[Lalo Schifrin]] provides the theme music for the game. The game has been translated to several languages for international distribution. ''Pandora Tomorrow'' was entitled '''''Shadow Strike''''' during its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/pandoratomorrow/news_6027718.html |title=Splinter Cell: Shadow Strike For 2003 |last=Calvert |first=Justin |date=2003-06-13 |work=GameSpot |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc |accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remastered, High-Definition, version of ''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow'' was announced for the [[PlayStation Network]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] on December 20, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://ps3.ign.com/articles/114/1141027p1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==

The gameplay of ''Pandora Tomorrow'' is largely unchanged from the original ''Splinter Cell''. The game features some moderate graphical improvements, as well as minor gameplay changes such as the fact that health kits are no longer an inventory item, and the addition of a [[Laser applications#Laser sight|laser sight]] to Sam's pistol that allows the player to know exactly where the rounds will strike, even when moving around. Also, Sam can now open doors while carrying a body, shoot while hanging upside down, [[SWAT]] turn past doorways unnoticed, and perform a half split jump. The pistol laser was replaced with an OCP{{huh?|date=November 2011}} and the SWAT turn{{huh?|date=November 2011}} was removed in ''Chaos Theory'', the next entry in the series. The PlayStation 2 and Gamecube versions also feature an additional single player mission to compensate for the abridged gameplay compared to the PC and Xbox versions.

== Multiplayer ==

The most significant gameplay change in ''Pandora Tomorrow'' is the addition of a multiplayer component to the series in an attempt to take advantage of the features and popularity of [[Xbox Live]]. Both the PlayStation 2 and PC versions of the game also come with multiplayer; however, the GameCube version does not. The game pits heavily armed Argus [[mercenaries]] against stealthy Shadownet [[Espionage|spies]]. The spies are played from a third-person viewpoint and control similarly to the main game's singleplayer mode, although they have their own unique moves and equipment. The mercenaries are played from a first-person viewpoint, and control more similarly to traditional [[first-person shooter]] characters. Although mercenaries have superior firepower, spies have the ability to hide in darkness and ambush or sneak past mercenaries in a number of ways. The total number of players in each multiplayer game is limited to 4. After the release of ''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory'' which included a very similar multiplayer mode, Ubisoft took down their multiplayer server for this game due to low numbers of players, leaving many angry with Ubisoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ubisoft-en.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/ubisoft_en.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=11745&amp;p_created=1172485098&amp;p_sid=STqZ4woj&amp;p_accessibility=0&amp;p_redirect=&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MTAsMTAmcF9wcm9kcz04OCwxMDc1JnBfY2F0cz0wJnBfcHY9Mi4xMDc1JnBfY3Y9JnBfc2VhcmNoX3R5cGU9YW5zd2Vycy5zZWFyY2hfbmwmcF9wYWdlPTE*&amp;p_li=&amp;p_topview=1 |title=With Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow I am having problems playing online via Ubi.com |work=UBISOFT Solution Center |publisher=Ubisoft Entertainment |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The main plot of ''Pandora Tomorrow'' takes place in [[Indonesia]] during the spring of [[2006]], in which the United States has established a military presence in the newly independent country of [[East Timor]] to train that country's military forces in their fight against anti-separatist Indonesian guerrilla militias. Foremost among these Indonesian militias is the Darah Dan Doa (Blood and Prayer), led by [[Suhadi Sadono]]. 

Charismatic militia leader Sadono, once trained by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to help [[CIA activities in Indonesia|fight Communist influences]] in the region, has grown resentful of the United States' support of East Timor and its supposed interference with his country's sovereignty. Sadono initiates a [[suicide bombing]] and follow up attack on the U.S. Embassy in [[Dili]], capturing a number of U.S. military and diplomatic personnel including [[List of Splinter Cell characters#Douglas Shetland|Douglas Shetland]], an old friend and comrade of Sam Fisher.

Fisher is sent to infiltrate the embassy and gather intelligence on the Darah Dan Doa. Fisher succeeds in his mission, and the U.S. Embassy is retaken by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army's]] [[1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta|Delta Force]]. Sadono escapes, and the U.S. launches a military campaign on Indonesian soil in an attempt to hunt him down, much to the protests of the Indonesian government.

Fisher learns that Sadono has masterminded a scheme known as &quot;Pandora Tomorrow&quot;, by placing a series of biological bombs (ND133's) equipped with the [[smallpox]] virus on American soil. Every 24 hours, Sadono makes encrypted phone calls to each of the bomb carriers to delay the release of the virus. If he is killed or detained, the virus is released and millions of Americans will die. Because Sadono is fighting on the front lines in the conflict, the U.S. cannot risk killing him, and is forced to withdraw its forces.

Fisher is sent to infiltrate Darah Dan Doa strongholds in order to learn the location of the smallpox bombs. He is assisted in this endeavor by Shetland and his [[private military company]], [[Displace International]]. Fisher ultimately learns the location of the bombs, and Shadownet spies are sent in to neutralize them, bringing an end to Sadono's threat against the United States. 

[[Third Echelon]] decides to capture Sadono alive instead of merely assassinating him, due to the problems created when Sam Fisher assassinated former [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] president [[Kombayn Nikoladze]] in the fall of [[2004]].

Although Fisher manages to capture Sadono, Third Echelon learns that a rogue CIA operative, [[Norman Soth]] has acquired the last smallpox-armed ND133, and intends to detonate it inside [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. Soth cares nothing for Indonesia, but intends to get revenge on the United States for a perceived betrayal which cost him a leg years earlier. Fisher infiltrates LAX, kills Soth and his group of terrorists (disguised as airport workers and security guards), and prevents the detonation of the last smallpox-armed ND133 by disguising himself as a maintenance worker and setting the ND133 down behind two police officers, who notice the device almost immediately, and have the airport evacuated. The [[Los Angeles Police Department]]'s Bomb Squad is then called in to perform a controlled explosion of the device, which is done by an unmanned vehicle using reinforced steel.

==Development==
{{Unreferenced-section |date=November 2011}}
===Windows version===
As with the original Splinter Cell, the Windows version is a port of the Xbox version, and duplicated that version's user interface and gameplay. However, the Windows version can run at higher resolutions than the console versions. The &quot;checkpoint&quot; save system from the Xbox version was replaced with the ability to save a game at any time, and the controls were reworked to allow simultaneous use of a keyboard and mouse, with movement speed being controlled by the mouse wheel. None of the bonus content from the other versions are present on this version.

There is an unfortunate graphical issue in this version, though.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Projected shadows do not appear in-game when using Nvidia GeForce 6 series video cards and up. This problem was caused because the game was a direct port from the Xbox, which renders shadows similarly to GeForce Series 3, 4, and FX cards. It is possible to force the shadows, but this can cause system instabilities.

===PlayStation 2 version===
As with the original Splinter Cell, the PS2 version runs at a lower resolution than the Xbox and GCN versions, and sacrifices had to be made to the graphics including more jagged edges, duller colors and fewer lighting effects, due to the more limited hardware. Also, despite these sacrifices, the framerate tends to stutter slightly more than the Xbox version. Loading times are also longer. Missions are also structured in a different/shorter fashion and the multiplayer component is not as extensive as its Xbox counterpart. The PS2 version boasts extra content, however, including a new Indonesian Jungle mission (which also appears in Essentials).

===GameCube version===
The GCN version runs at a lower resolution to that of the Xbox/PC version and graphically it does not quite look as realistic. Like the PS2 version, sacrifices were made here and there with the lighting effects. Missions are also structured like the PS2 version, in a different/shorter fashion than that of the Xbox/PC counterpart. Despite this, the exclusive PS2 section of the Indonesian Jungle mission is NOT included with this version of the game.

On the plus side, Game Boy Advance connectivity is supported. Using the GameCube-Game Boy Advance cable you can connect the GBA to the GCN, a map of the level the player is currently in is displayed on the GBA, and includes locations of enemies and items, remote detonate wall mines and control turrets.

===PlayStation 3===
A PlayStation 3 version was announced to be part of the Splinter Cell Trilogy which was released in September 2011 as part of Sony's [[Classics HD]] series. It was revealed on the PlayStation Blog, that the game will be a port of the PC version, which had more details and content than on PS2. &lt;ref&gt;http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/04/07/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-trilogy-coming-to-ps3-in-june-with-3d/#utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PSBlog+%28PlayStation.Blog%29&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been revealed however, that the online multiplayer will not be included in the collection &lt;ref&gt;http://www.computerandvideogames.com/297310/splinter-cell-hd-trilogy-lacks-multiplayer/&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite being a port of the PC Splinter Cell's this trilogy does not include online multiplayer or the downloadable bonus missions. It also does not include the PS2 exclusive bonus missions for Splinter Cell 1&amp;2.

==Reception==
On the review-aggregate site [[Metacritic]], the [[Xbox]] version received a score of 93% based on 74 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/tomclancyssplintercellpandoratomorrow |title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow for Xbox |accessdate=2007-08-14 |work=Metacritic |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Game Rankings]], it had a score of 92.3% based on 82 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/itemrankings/searchresult.asp?term=pandora+tomorrow&amp;itemid=915074 |title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow for Xbox |work=Game Rankings |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc |accessdate=2007-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Kasavin of [[GameSpot]] gave the Xbox version a score of 9.1 and said that the single-player and multiplayer portions of the game will appeal to anyone interested in high-tech stealth and subterfuge. He also said that players familiar with Splinter Cell should expect 10 hours or more of gameplay. Kasavin said the storyline in Pandora Tomorrow was more cohesive than the original Splinter Cell, but the gameplay often becomes pure trial and error, noting that the missions &quot;could have benefited from feeling less rigid and scripted&quot; but were &quot;incredibly slick.&quot; Kasavin also praised the multiplayer mode for its innovation, complexity, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/pandoratomorrow/review.html |title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow for Xbox review |accessdate=2007-08-14 |last=Kasavin |first=Greg |date=2004-03-24 |work=[[Gamespot]] |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the Xbox version received an average score of 9.4 out of 10 based on 33 reviews, additionally receiving a 100% &quot;Fresh Rating&quot; due to gaining highly positive reviews from all 33 reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/g/xbox/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_pandora_tomorrow |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=IGN Entertainment |title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow for Xbox |accessdate=2007-08-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016203720/http://rottentomatoes.com/g/xbox/tom_clancys_splinter_cell_pandora_tomorrow |archivedate = October 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongoose of Game Chronicles Magazine also gave the Xbox a 9.4 out of 10 and gave special praise to the multiplayer portion of the game. He called the game &quot;the single best reason to get online&quot; on Xbox Live. However, he felt that gameplay in the single player campaign at times got increasingly linear and leaned toward scripted challenges, with &quot;only one solution to any given problem&quot;, requiring &quot;the use of a particular gadget or one of Samâs nimble moves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamechronicles.com/reviews/xbox/scpandora/tomorrow.htm |work=Game Chronicles Magazine |title=Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow for Xbox |accessdate=2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
