'''Disney Channel Russia''' is a television channel owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], which began broadcast in [[Russia]] and other [[CIS]] countries. It  replaced '''[[Jetix (Russia)|Jetix]].

While Disney previously planned to launch Disney Channel Russia as an over-the-air service in 2009, their deal with a Russian media company was rejected by Russian authorities. Disney Channel is available as a cable and satellite channel, and is made available via the regular operators (such as [[NTV Plus]]). A registration request was filed in 2010 with the Russian media authority Roscomnadzor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2010/03/16/media/464670 ''&quot;ÐÐ½Ð¸Ð³Ð° Ð¼Ð°ÑÑÐµÑÐ¾Ð²&quot; Ð¿Ð¾ÑÐ»Ð° Ð¿Ð¾ Ð¼Ð¸ÑÑ'' (''[The film] The Book of Masters goes around the world'') (in Russian)&lt;br/&gt;In the interview, Walt Disney Company CIS director Marina Zhigalova-Ozkan says:&lt;br/&gt;{{quote|We decided to give up our plans to enter the over-the-air TV segment. Currently all our efforts are centered on the development of our Jetix channel. Apart from that, we recently filed documents with Roscomnadzor for the registration of the Disney Channel. Now the document review period has been extended to six months.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 9, 2010 the Russian TV authority granted Walt Disney Company CIS a cable television broadcasting license (#15922). Later it was announced that the change will happen on August 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Disney going to start | publisher = ComNews | url = http://www.comnews.ru/index.cfm?id=52866}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Russian viewers will be able to watch Disney channel programs of August | publisher = Lenizdat.Ru | url = http://www.lenizdat.ru/a0/ru/pm1/c-1089446-0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = One of Disney will be more | publisher = Izvestiya.Ru | url = http://www.izvestiya.ru/tv/article3141996/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The new Disney Channel will appear on the cable and satellite TV in Russia | publisher = RIA Novosti | url = http://www.rian.ru/media/20100520/236423531.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://disney.ru/DisneyCMS/Content/CompanyNews/104.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney Channel Russia replaced Jetix Russia, making it the last Jetix-branded channel in the world to close. Unlike many other Disney Channels in Europe, which broadcast a single video feed with several language tracks, this version is  custom-made for Russia. For example, the Playhouse Disney block (to be renamed Disney Junior in 2012) is known on screen by its Russian title (from [[Channel 1 (Russia)|Russian TV Channel 1]]) ''Ð£Ð·Ð½Ð°Ð²Ð°Ð¹ÐºÐ°''. Other titles and logos are translated and adapted as well.
