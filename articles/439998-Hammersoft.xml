The '''Air Force 1''' (or '''AF1''') [[athletic shoe]] is a product of [[Nike, Inc.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;MercuryNews1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=On 25th Anniversary, Nike Cranks Up The Noise About Air Force Shoes |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/16656504.htm |publisher=The Mercury News |date=2007-02-10 |author=Mark de la Vina}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by designer Bruce Kilgore. This was the first basketball shoe to use the Nike Air technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nike takes shot at pop-up concept |url=http://www.thestar.com/Life/article/181300 |date=2007-02-17 |publisher=Toronto Star |author=Derick Chetty}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shoe is offered in low, mid and high top.

==Overview==
The name is a reference to [[Air Force One]], the plane that carries the [[President of the United States]]. The shoes are sold in three different styles, low, mid and high. The mid-top and high-top Air Force 1s come with a [[velcro]]-securable strap; the mid-top strap is secured to the shoe while the high-top's strap is movable and removable on some versions. Although the shoe comes in many different colors and color schemes, the most common Air Force 1's sold are solid white (also referred to as white on white), the second most common being solid black (also referred to as black on black).

Another identifying characteristic of an Air Force 1 shoe is a small medallion (called a ''[[deubrÃ©]]'') that is secured to the bottom of the laces but has holes on either side so it can be removed by sliding it off of the shoe lace. The medallion is engraved with the inscription &quot;AF-1&quot;, with the year &quot;'82&quot; inscribed below it, and has historically been made out of a silver-colored metal (perhaps [[pewter]]). Its original design was more circular, but after a redesign for the Air Force 1's 25th anniversary in 2007 the medallion is now rectangular. (The redesign also involved encasing the inscription in white plastic; that was discarded in favor of the original medallion material.)

The Air Force 1 was produced in 1982 and discontinued the following year. It was re-released in 1986 with the modern italic Nike logo with a [[Swoosh]] on the bottom on the back of the shoe. Little has changed to the Air Force One since its creation in 1982, although the original stitching on the side panels is no longer present in modern versions of the shoe. Since then, over 1,700 color variations have been produced, bringing in an estimated 800 million [[USD]]/year in revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;MercuryNews1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nike's Air Force 1s Are Still Flying High |url=http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070222/NEWS/702220400/1001/BUSINESS |publisher=The Ledger |date=2007-02-22 |author=Elizabeth Wellington}}&lt;/ref&gt; The selling of the Air Force Ones online by certain retailers used to be prohibited by Nike who had restricted supply of the sneaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;BusinessWeek1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=All The Rage Since Reagan |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_30/b3944107_mz017.htm?campaign_id=rss_magzn |publisher=Business Week |date=2005-07-25 |author=Stanley Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nike now allows retailers to offer the shoe for sale online.
As a performance shoe, the AF1 is still used for street play as well as for professional play. NBA players [[Jerry Stackhouse]] (who now wears Adidas) and [[Rasheed Wallace]] have worn AF1s on court.

Nike Air Force 1s were originally considered the favored shoe of inner-city youth, then [[hip hop]] artists and [[streetball]] players. Rapper [[Nelly]] and his group, [[St. Lunatics]], collaborated on a 2002 single entitled &quot;[[Air Force Ones (song)|Air Force Ones]]&quot; about the shoes.  The shoe is also a focus of the 2007 [[Grammy]]-nominated single [[Classic (Better Than I've Ever Been)]], a collaboration between [[Kanye West]], [[Nas]], [[Rakim]] and [[KRS-One]], that was produced by [[Rick Rubin]].

==Later versions==
The ''Air Force 2'' shoe introduced in 1987 is a newer variation of the original. The shoe is a typical flat-soled, casual-wear sneaker that can be made in many different variations of colors. Also, Air Force 2s were re-released internationally in the early [[2000â2009|2000s]]. They can be made in either the low-cut or high-top style. 

The shoe can be custom made in any color, but typically it has either a white or black based background color with almost any color used to fill in the Nike Swoosh and back heel.

The ''Air Force 3'' shoe introduced in 1988 was the most popular version of Air Force series. It was worn by many basketball players at the time. The Air Force III was more rugged looking and more durable than the previous two versions. The original colorway was white/medium grey/black, however several other colors were

introduced shortly after. An actual &quot;Air FORCE&quot; logo was introduced on this model as well, with an image of half of a basketball on the tongue. This logo would be used on the rest of the Air Force series. The Air Force III was re-issued in 2006 in very limited edition of colorways of the high top, and several colorways for the low top version.

The ''&quot;Air Force STS&quot;'' (also known as Air Force 4 or Air Force IV) was introduced in 1989. It was regularly worn by [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]] in his rookie year. The Air Force STS features leopard print and is also slightly higher than the first 3 versions of the Air Force series.

The ''&quot;Air Force 5&quot;'' was introduced in 1990. The Air Force V was the first model to make the airbag visible on the side heels of the shoe. The most popular colorway was white/medium grey/black/orange. Just like the previous version it was slightly higher than the first 3 versions. This was also the last original Air Force model to be made.

In 2007, for the 25th anniversary of the original Air Force 1, Nike created the [[Air Force XXV]], which got its inspiration from original Air Force 1 invented in 1979.  A commercial for the Air Force XXV included [[LeBron James]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Steve Nash]], [[Shawn Marion]], [[Rasheed Wallace]], [[Tony Parker]], [[Jermaine O'Neal]], [[Amar'e Stoudemire]], [[Chris Paul]], and [[Paul Pierce]], featuring the music of [[Juelz Santana]] (the ''Second Coming'').This version featured a mismatched set of medallions to commerate it's twenty fifth year anniversary. One was from the original air force ones and another was from the air force 25's. Since its introduction, many different Air Force 1s have been designed or inspired by celebrities and athletes.

Also in 2007, to further commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Air Force One, two high-end makes of the shoe were introduced. They were hand-crafted in Italy, one from crocodile leather and the other from anaconda leather, and both were adorned with gold-tipped laces. They were sold in extremely limited quantities and had an MSRP of $2000.00, making them some of the most expensive sneakers ever to enter the marketplace.

In 2009, Nike created Air Force 09, an update of the original shoe. The shoe comes in a solid black or white.

In 2010, Nike commissioned [[DJ Clark Kent]] to design a &quot;[http://www.streetlevel.com/2010/07/30/nike-air-force-1-low-5-borough-pack-release-info/ Nike Five Boroughs AF1 Low]&quot; pack of special limited edition Air Force 1 shoes and unveiled them at fully catered a block party in Manhattan's [[SoHo]] neighborhood on Mercer Street outside the [http://nikeid.nike.com/nikeid/index.jsp Nike ID] store at 21 Mercer.

==Emergence as a Collector's Item==
The Air Force One has become a favorite of sneaker collectors, often referred to as [[Sneakerhead]]s. Certain rare styles can command several times their retail value in online marketplaces such as [[EBay]] and [[Craigslist]]. Stores such as Sole Control in [[Philadelphia]] and Flight Club in [[New York City]] carry rare and exclusive versions for sale, as well as offering consignment services for sellers.
