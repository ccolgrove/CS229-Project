'''Biography:'''&lt;br&gt;
Guan Yu is straight-headed, righteous and loyal. He is known for fighting around the world alongside his best friend, [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhang Fei (å¼µé£)|Zhang Fei]], with whom he has attended twenty-four schools together (only because he always gets kicked out for starting fights). Eventually, he lands a place in [[K.O.3an Guo#Schools|East Han Academy]] (æ±æ¼¢æ¸é¢) with the help of his sworn brother, [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Liu Bei (åå)|Liu Bei]].

Because of his honesty, he is sometimes taken advantage of by his enemies. And because of that, his friends are often forced to lie to him, which leads to unpredicted consequences.

Guan Yu's face turns red on two occasions; when he is around a beautiful girl or when he gets really upset.

*''Demonization:''
Guan Yu learns the skill of Zhen Cha Jing from Lu Bu, after he was instructed by Dong Zhuo, to restore Principal Wang's health. Though he succeeds in healing Principal Wang, he begins to suffer from internal injuries until he eventually collapses while slowly being demonized. Sun Shang Xiang later tricks Dong Zhuo to give her instructions to cure Guan Yu by using nightmarish toxin. Dong Zhuo instructs her the skill of Hao Cha Jing would heal his condition. Though Guan Yu's condition finally lightens up, his internal injuries are only dormant for the time being while his powers and instincts demonize slowly.

Lu Bu later tells him of his demonized powers and shortened lifespan in hopes to convince him in stopping Dong Zhuo and dethrone Liu Bian, but Guan Yu declines the offer. As he realizes how dangerous he will become to the world, he attempts to give up his powers and martial arts to prevent himself from taking the path of evil, but Xiu/Liu Bei arrives just in time to stop him. After he tells them of Zhen Cha Jing's side effects, Xiu/Liu Bei takes out a pair of cymbals called Demon Subduing Cymbals (Ke Mo Ba) that will reduce his dangerous and competitive instincts.

In a battle against Dong Zhuo, Guan Yu falls under his control and attacks his friends, but Xiu/Liu Bei stops him with the cymbals. He blames himself for hurting his friends, even though he knows that he was not himself. In order to help him, Xiu/Liu Bei suggests to use the Soul Cleansing Melody to strip his powers away forever. Though he hesitated at first, Diao Chan convinces him to live. The following day, Xiu/Liu Bei finds out about the capability of the Soul Calming Melody which can be played within 24 hours of the Soul Cleansing Melody to restore the victims powers and decides to use its power to restore Guan Yu's. However, as soon as Xiu/Liu Bei begins to draw power from it, it lures demons, Lu Bu and Dong Zhuo to their location and they are stopped midway. Because the experiment failed, Guan Yu began to age rapidly the next day. Xiu/Liu Bei turns to Xia Liu for advice and finds out that they could combine their powers to restore Guan Yu's powers again. Together, they find a place filled with positive energy and their battle armies to fend off the demons while the rest play the Soul Calming Melody. After a rough fight with the superior demons, Guan Yu's powers are finally restored. His powers were slightly amplified after they were restored.

*''Friendship:''
He becomes sworn brothers with best friend Zhang Fei and new friend Liu Bei to enroll East Han Academy. Because he is unaware that Liu Bei is actually Xiu from the Iron Dimension, he is often kept in the dark from Xiu and Zhang Fei's secret conversations. However, he remains in complete faith with his brothers.

Initially he did not get along with [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhao Yun (è¶é²)|Zhao Yun]], but after he risks his own arm to take in a poisonous arrow for him, their relationship begins to change. He also forms a friendship with companions: [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Ma Chao (é¦¬è¶)|Ma Chao]] and [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Huang Zhong (é»å¿ )|Huang Zhong]].

*''Love life:''
He develops a crush on the principal's daughter, [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Diao Chan (è²è¬)|Diao Chan]], already on his first day at school. However, when she begins seeing Lu Bu, his feelings become conflicted. After Diao Chan and Lu Bu's relationship falls apart, Guan Yu becomes increasingly close to her, despite she is still in love with Lu Bu. He indicates that he only wants what's best for her, not what he wants from her. While under the influence of a personality changing potion, Diao Chan confesses to Guan Yu and they become a couple.

*''Supposed Death:''
Under Liu Bei orders, Guan Yu guarded Jin Zhou Lou alone and was killed in the fight with Sun Quan as Lu Meng interfered. Then it was revealed that he actually did not die. He used a type of power that allows the user to not breathe, and then when they buried him, he dug himself out.

'''Nicknames:'''&lt;br&gt;
Ah Chang (é¿é·) by Diao Chan while they are a couple.

'''Specialty:'''&lt;br&gt;
Guan Yuâs weapon is âQing Long Yan Yue Daoâ (éé¾åæå / ''Green Dragon Crescent Moon Blade'').

He can easily learn the opponentâs moves and find his weak point. Because of that, he is known as one of the strongest martial artists in history.

Guan Yu uses &quot;Xing Tian Kuai Quan&quot; (è¡å¤©å¿«æ³ / ''Sky Crossing Speed Fist'') attack opponents at lightning speed.

Guan Yu's primary attacks are three powerful blows learned from &quot;Xing Tian Gong&quot; (è¡å¤©å); a series of powerful kung fu skills inherited from his family.
His first attack is &quot;Xing Tian Po&quot; (è¡å¤©ç ´), which allows him to produce offensive raw energy toward his opponents and neutralize their attacks. He once explained that if he uses it with full strength, his target will explode to millions of pieces.

During his encounter with the legendary magician, Zuo Ci, he acquires two additional attacks from this ability called &quot;Xing Tian Po&quot; (è¡å¤©è¿«) and &quot;Xing Tian Po&quot; (è¡å¤©é­), which respectively work as methods to repress and ultimate destroy the opponent.

The second Xing Tian Po also allows him to attack nearby enemies in great speed, which even exceeds the speed of his Sky Crossing Speed skill.

When he releases all three attacks, the impact is utmost powerful.

According to the character's biography on GTV.com, Guan Yu's strongest attack is called &quot;Dragon Moaning Space&quot; (é¾åå¤ªè).

'''Alternate counterpart:'''&lt;br&gt;
Guan Yu has an alternate counterpart in the Iron Dimension called [[List of The X-Family characters#The Great Traveler (ç¥è¡è) / The God of Guns (æ§éç)|the Great Traveler]], who is born with an evil half called [[List of The X-Family characters#The Great Traveler (ç¥è¡è) / The God of Guns (æ§éç)|the God of Guns]]. To everyone else, they are known as a pair of legendary warriors of good.

'''Five Tiger General:''' 2nd.&lt;br&gt;
'''Courtesy name:''' Zhang Yide (å¼µç¿¼å¾·).&lt;br&gt;
'''School year:''' Freshman.&lt;br&gt;
'''Birthdate:''' Silver Dimensional Year 4333, April 17.&lt;br&gt;

'''Fighting Power Points:''' 13000+ (15000+ When he gets angry)&lt;br&gt;
'''Original counterpart:''' ''[[Zhang Fei]]''&lt;br&gt;
'''Actor:''' Bo Yan (åç) â ''Wu Hu Jiang (æ­¦èå°)''.

'''Biography:'''&lt;br&gt;
Zhang Fei himself comes from a very wealthy family. All gangster members are afraid of his wrath and would do anything to avoid provoking him, even pretending to be nice and polite.

With some help from his sworn brother [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Liu Bei (åå)|Liu Bei]], Zhang Fei manages to enroll East Han Academy with best friend [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Guan Yu (éç¾½)|Guan Yu]] â where he can explore his abilities. But he is also responsible in paying all of their tuition.

He is the first person to meet [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Wang Da Dong (æ±ªå¤§æ±)|Da Dong]], [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Wang Ya Se (çäºç)|Ya Se]] and [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Ding Xiao Yu (ä¸å°é¨)|Xiao Yu]] from ''[[KO One]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸ç­); and [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Xiu (è©) / Liu Bei (åå)|Xiu]] from ''[[The X-Family]]'' (çµæ¥µä¸å®¶). He is also the only person who knows of Xiuâs true identity, as well as the existence of the twelve dimensions.

*''Friendship:''
Zhang Fei has been friends with Guan Yu since childhood. They even attended twenty-four schools and got resulted in suspension together. When they encounter Liu Bei, the three of them become sworn brothers, with Zhang Fei being the youngest.

Initially, he does not get along with [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhao Yun (è¶é²)|Zhao Yun]] because of his arrogant character. But during the challenge of Eight Doors Golden Lock Formation, he learns to overcome that issue and become equal partners as well as good friends.

As the only person who knows of Xiu's true identity, he does his best to help him hide it from the others. He once stated that no matter how fate had twisted things, Xiu is their older brother and that fact will never change.

'''Specialty:'''&lt;br&gt;
Zhang Feiâs weapon is âZhan Ba She Maoâ (æ°å«èç / ''Battle Eight Snakes Lance'').

âBa She Poâ (å«èç ´) and &quot;Ba Shan Quan&quot; (æå±±æ³ / ''Mount Ripping Fist'') â Zhang Feiâs special ability.

If anyone calls him âXiao Nao Naoâ (å°å­¬å­¬) he will get so mad that his face turns black and his strength increases to an incredible level. After his wrath is expressed, he will revert to his normal state with no memory of what happened when his face turned black.

His face turns black when his anger maximizes after someone calls him &quot;Xiao Nao Nao&quot; (å°å­¬å­¬). By then, his strength will expand to an unexpected point, which even surpasses that of Zhao Yun, who is supposed to be stronger than he is when he is in his normal state. Once his anger is expressed, however, his face will return to normal and he recalls no memory of what happened while he was &quot;angry&quot;.

In the 15th round, he demonstrates a powerful attack called &quot;Hei Feng Pi Li Quan&quot; (é»é¢¨é¹éæ³).

According to the character's biography on GTV.com, Zhang Fei's strongest attack is called &quot;Ba She Po&quot; (å«èç ´).
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

'''Original counterpart:''' ''[[Zhao Yun]]''&lt;br&gt;
'''Actor:''' [[Benjamin Wang|Benji]] (ç­å) â ''Wu Hu Jiang'' (æ­¦èå°).

'''Biography:'''&lt;br&gt;
Good-looking and graceful mannered.

Although Zhao Yun is listed as the third Tiger General, his power is actually almost equal to [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Guan Yu (éç¾½)|Guan Yu]]âs.

Zhao Yun has been so attractive to girls since childhood that he grabs attention from every girl at sight, except [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Diao Chan (è²è¬)|Diao Chan]]. But once his sight turns away, their hearts will break... literally.

When Dong Zhuo tricked the Generals into a trap, Zhao Yun was stored with the device &quot;Lock Maria,&quot; and his power was locked away for a short period of time until his friends found the remote that could remove the device's hold on him. After his power was restored, he removed the cloth on his head.

*''Friendship:''
Initially, he does not get along with Guan Yu, and mostly shows dislike towards [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhang Fei (å¼µé£)|Zhang Fei]]; but after facing a challenge together, they learn to overcome their problems and becomes friends, though Zhang Fei still likes to embarrass him when he is around a girl.

*''Love life:''
Zhao Yun seems to have a fondness in Xiao Qiao, but he tries to hide it. &lt;br&gt;When Xiao Qiao casts a spell to teleport Zhao Yun and his friends away, he tries to stay behind to protect her but gets teleported before he could leave the crowd. Once the teleportation is complete, he worries for Xiao Qiao's safety more than any of them. As more time passes, he becomes increasingly close to Xiao Qiao. And his affection of her is assumed to be love, though he stated that he is fond of Xiao Qiao as a sister.

'''Specialty:'''&lt;br&gt;
Zhao Yunâs weapon is âZhui Feng Xi Yin Qiangâ (è¿½é¢¨æ´éæ§ / ''Wind Following Silver Cleansing Spear''). As depicted from the name, it moves as fast as wind if not faster.

In the 15th episode, Zhao Yun demonstrates two powerful attacks called &quot;Pan Long Ti&quot; (ç¤é¾è¸¢) and &quot;Long Xin Taichi&quot; (é¾å½¢å¤ªæ¥µ).

Because Zhao Yun is an &quot;original power-user of wind&quot; (é¢¨çåä½ç°è½è¡è), he can combine forces with Xiu to boost their powers. But he is unaware of this information himself.

According to the character's biography on GTV.com, Zhao Yun's strongest attack is called &quot;Feng Qi Yun Yong&quot; (é¢¨èµ·é²å).

Born in a family of powerful warriors. His grandfather is the founder of ''Guo Jia Wu Xue Zhi Liao Guan'' (åå®¶æ­¦å­¸è³æé¤¨ / ''National Wushu Information House''); and his mother is the author of ''Ha Li Po Te Yu Gong Fu Wang Zi'' (ååæ³¢ç¹èåå¤«çå­ / ''Harry Potter and the Kung-Fu Prince).

Like [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Ding Xiao Yu (ä¸å°é¨)|Ding Xiao Yu]] from the Gold Dimension, he doesn't like violence, and only offers the opponent to hit him three times in order to bore him out. This is because he blamed himself for killing his best friend, Bo Ren, when they practiced [[Wushu (sport)|wushu]]. Afterward, it was found out that he did not exactly kill his friend, but only caused him a heart attack that killed him afterward.

Though he is only the Fourth Tiger General, his strength rivals that of Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.

After the Five Tiger Generals broke through the ''Eight Doors Golden Lock Formation'', he enrolled the East Han Academy with [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Huang Zhong (é»å¿ )|Huang Zhong]].

*''Hobbies:''

'''Specialty:'''&lt;br&gt;
Ma Chaoâs weapon is âPiao Qi Xuan Tie Qiangâ (é©é¨çéµæ§ / ''Mounted Steed Deep Iron Spear'').

Ma Chao specializes an ability called &quot;Cotton Candy Sweet Sweet Fist&quot; (æ£è±ççæ³) to counter strong physical attacks. However, if someone uses a soft method, such as taichi, he can easily be overpowered. He initially utilizes this power to make his body soft as cotton, but from the 15th round onward, he begins to utilize it to create a cloud to attack his opponents. It was mentioned by Zhang Fei in the 2nd round that he can at least withstand two hundred people's physical attacks.

âXu Mi Quanâ (èå½æ³) â Ma Chao's primary ability was inherited from his family. One hit from this attack corresponds to thousands of punches.&lt;br clear=all&gt;

'''Biography:'''&lt;br&gt;
An excellent arrow shooter. He can listen to the winds to find directions.

Having no family of his own, Huang Zhong values his relationship with the Five Tiger Generals more than any of them.

After breaking the ''Eight Doors Golden Lock Formation'', he enrolled the East Han Academy with [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Ma Chao (é¦¬è¶)|Ma Chao]] as students.

Huang Zhong was taken to an orphanage at the age of three. Because he never got to know his parents, he had always wondered what they looked like and why they had abandoned him. Whenever the teacher told him to make projects  that involves &quot;family&quot;, he would feel extremely depressed.

*''Reunion with his mother:''
After years of separation, he finally reunites with his mother, only to find out that she is a member of Huang Jin High School: one of the worst, most devilish institutions in the Silver Dimension. When he was spotted with his mother by Dong Han Report, his relationship to his mother was exposed and he was forced to see lesser with his mother to avoid complications. At first he was doubtful if she really was his mother because of her fierce attitude, but later warms up to the idea.

When Dong Zhuo forced him to fight his own mother, he became extremely doubtful as he could not bear to hurt her. He would jump in front of his mother's way to protect her from harm.

It was later revealed that his mom had only joined Huang Jin to work as a spy for the Nationwide School Union. Knowing that his mother had always loved him, he acknowledges that all negative feelings had turned into happy ones.

Huang Zhongâs weapon is a metal glove with an electronic crossbow attached to his arm named âYu Tian Gongâ  (å¾¡å¤©å¼ / ''Chariot of Heaven Bow''). Sometimes, he uses âBing Po Yin Jianâ (å°é­éç®­ / ''Ice Vigor Silver Arrow'') to attack his enemies, which comes in two sizes-One that fits his arm length and another that is like any ordinary bow, both seems to be metallic. These arrows disappear after they impact. On demanding situations, he utilizes a larger arrow bow named &quot;Frightening Sun Shot Bow&quot; (é©å¤©å°æ¥å¼) to attack his enemies from a distance. When he uses this weapon, his ice arrows are also enlarged.

Huang Zhong has an unusually slow respiration rate and pulse, and cannot be easily affected with toxic air.

According to the character biography on GTV.com, Huang Zhong's ultimate attack is Yu Tian Shi Er Nian Fa (å¾¡å¤©åäºé£ç¼).

Because of a fateful twist of events, he wound up in the Silver Dimension and assumed the identity of [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Liu Bei (åå)|Liu Bei]]. As he spends more time there, he realizes the Silver Dimension is somehow connected to the ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' as most events and people seemed to be connected to that story.

Because he prohibited from using his powers at any time, he has a hard time hiding them when he is in a bind.

Having learned a lot about ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', Xiu possesses knowledge of [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Guan Yu (éç¾½)|Guan Yu]] and the others' characteristics and future, but struggles to keep it hidden from them.

As he spends more time in the Silver Dimension, he forms a strong bond with Guan Yu and the others. Later, he becomes willing to help them dominate the world and bring peace to it.

*''Love life:''
He has fallen for Jiangdong High School's [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Sun Shang Xiang (å­«å°é¦)|Sun Shang Xiang]], as this is shown when he became unusually happy when he heard that Shang Xiang had transferred to the East Han Academy.

The two of them are reunited once he decides to infiltrate her family's landmark to save her from her wedding with Yuan Shao. When he was chosen to go to Hedong for war, he confessed to Ah Xiang about his feelings. Later, when the real Liu Bei came back, he has no choice but to leave Ah Xiang.

In episode 47, Sun Jian allowed him to be engaged to Shang Xiang, however, he have to go through a test, to beat Sun Quan in an archery test. However, on the last shoot, he purposely make his shoot slower so he could lose.
Later, he confessed to Shang Xiang about his real identity.

Earlier in ''[[The X-Family]]'', Xiu fell for another girl named [[List of The X-Family characters#Han (å¯)|Han (å¯)]], but because she was in love with [[List of The X-Family characters#Xia Tian (å¤å¤©) / Gui Long (é¬¼é¾)|Xia Tian (å¤å¤©)]] and he wanted to focus on his duties, he kept his feelings a secret. Eventually, those feelings died out before they began.

Xiu has two weapons: one of them is a guitar pick called âShen Feng Pi Keâ (ç¥é¢¨éå / ''Divine Wind Guitar Pick'') that increases his powers and produce healing energy: the other is being a  yellow electric guitar called &quot;Little Wasp&quot; (å°é»è) to create various forms of musical atmospheres in battle. On one occasion, Zuo Ci lent him a more powerful guitar called âQing Hong Zi Dianâ (éè¹ç´«é» / ''Clear Rainbow Purple Lightning'') to aid him in his battle against Dong Zhuo.

Xiu is an &quot;original power-user of wind&quot; (é¢¨çåä½ç°è½è¡è) in his dimension and can therefore combine forces with Zhao Yun, who is also an original power-user of wind in the Silver Dimension.

He is fairly good in archery, and was commented by Sun Quan to have excellent hearing strength, and having the ability to detect air movements.

'''Alternate counterpart:'''&lt;br&gt;

Though she is born with a natural beauty, she dislikes people who fall in love with others based on their appearance.

Unlike most girls, who fall for men with power and position, Diao Chan dreams of finding a man who could give her safety.

She falls into depression after her father fell in a comatose state, but remains strong and cheerful in front of her friends. When her father finally awakes from his coma, Diao Chan finally cheer up for real.

After she was framed to have collected fake money coins from the students, she sells her house to pay her debts and becomes roommates with best friend Xiao Qiao.

*''Change of personality:''
Hua Tuo helps Cao Cao invent a potion to change Diao Chan's personality under Principal Wang's request. While it was still under production, it turned her into an aggressive character. However, once he makes a proper brew, she becomes more cheerful and optimistic. And, under the influence of the potion, she confesses to Guan Yu and they become a loving couple.

In 23rd Round, she begins to suffer side effects from drinking a warm Bian Hen Da (è®å¾å¤§), which induces her face with a red mark and later throws her into a deadly coma. Lu Bu manages to cure her with Zhen Cha Jing, thus removes all effects of Bian Hen Da.

Diao Chan is also the figure of Guan Yu's crush. And though they have shown attractions to each other, Diao Chan prefers to think of him as a friend. During Lu Bu's absence, the two become increasingly close to each other. Then, Diao Chan confirms that he has become an important part of her life, although she has yet to figure out what that part might be.

While under the influence of a personality changing potion, Diao Chan confesses to Guan Yu and they become a couple. After she is &quot;cured&quot; of Bian Hen Da's side effects, she still chooses Guan Yu over Lu Bu. When she learned about her father's unexpected death and knowing the possible death that could befall Guan Yu, Diao Chan decides to participate in the battle. But because she knows her inability of kung fu practice gives her the most deathly disadvantage, she ends her relationship with Guan Yu by giving him a potion to erase his memory of her as a fail safe to protect him from heartbreak if she dies in the battle. However, she survives the fall and meets Guan Yu in the 53rd Round.

'''Biography:'''&lt;br&gt;
Xiao Qiao is a pretty girl who is best friends with [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Diao Chan (è²è¬)|Diao Chan (è²è¬)]], the two often discuss personal things together.

She has a hard time watching her mouth; for some reason, whenever she says something bad will happen it always does, causing everyone around to feel fearful and uneasy whenever she voices her opinions. Others often refer to this as ''Crow's Mouth'' (çé´å´).

She sometimes involves herself with the Five Tiger Generals' (äºèå°) missions.

Like any girl, she is attracted to men with strength and great ambitions.

She was a dancer two years prior to the show's beginning, but quit after her painful breakup with Zhou Yu.

*''Love life:''
She has a close friendship with [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhao Yun (è¶é²)|Zhao Yun (è¶é²)]]. Their relationship begins to blossom when Zhao Yun loses his powers and she assists the Five Tiger Generals (äºèå°) in reclaiming them for him. After his power is restored, they became closer to each other.

Xiao Qiao and [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhou Yu (å¨ç)|Zhou Yu (å¨ç)]] from Jiangdong High School (æ±æ±é«æ ¡) had a relationship two years prior to the beginning of the story. Their relationship ended when she accidentally caught him with Da Qiao together, without knowing that they were pretending to be a couple to protect Sun Ce from his father's suspicion. Before their break-up, they owned a puppy named &quot;Xiao Jin&quot; (å°ç¾), named after Zhou Yu's courtesy name. Although whatever they had is over, Zhou Yu is still very protective of her, but she tries to ignore him at all costs. Whenever she finds her friends in trouble, she would first turn to him for help. Ah Xiang senses that she may still be in love with Zhou Yu, even though she doesn't know it herself.  When Zhou Yu helped restore Guan Yu's lost powers and protected her from Dong Zhuo, it seems that her feelings for him begin to reawaken, if they were even gone at all.

Xiao Qiao is unaware that the student body president, [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Cao Cao (æ¹æ)|Cao Cao (æ¹æ)]] has great affection on her. Her closeness to [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhao Yun (è¶é²)|Zhao Yun (è¶é²)]] causes him heartache beyond her imagining. In the 28th Round, he finally works up the courage to confess to her, but she runs off in shock, not knowing how to turn him down without hurting his feelings. He then attempts to cheer her up by buying a puppy for her, but it brings up bad memories of Zhou Yu and the puppy they had before their break up. Eventually, Cao Cao decides to give up as a way to protect her from further stress. As time passes, they begin to grow closer to each other than before.

'''Specialty:'''&lt;br&gt;
Xiao Qiao did not display any special abilities in the early episodes. However, she is widely known for her ''Crow's Mouth''  (çé´å´) which frightens everyone around her.

When Xiao Qiao gets upset her physical strength seems to grow stronger.

It is later revealed that she displays fighting skills of her own and uses a pair of fans called &quot;Leng Liang Feng Huo Shan&quot; (å·æ¶¼é¢¨ç«æ) as weapons. It is interesting to note that she is the second person in the Silver Dimension to display the super-speeding ability. The other being Guan Yu.

During their break-in to Jiang Dong High School, Xiao Qiao learns a transporting technique (Wei Feng Zhen Zhen) from one of Xiu/Liu Bei's secret option bags. She occasionally uses it to transport people to her wanted destinations.

'''Alternate counterpart:'''&lt;br&gt;
Xiao Qiao has an alternate counterpart introduced throughout the Zhong Ji (çµæ¥µ) series:
:In the Gold Dimension called [[List of KO One characters#Cai Wu Xiong (è¡äºç)|Cai Wu Xiong (è¡äºç)]] from the first series [[KO One]] (çµæ¥µä¸ç­). Wu Xiong is the only notable person to have read the entire series of &quot;Jin Bi Dian Long&quot; (éç­é»é¾ / ''The Golden Pen Touches The Dragon'') and therefore knows something about the future. She is also [[List of KO One characters#Wang Ya Se (çäºç)|Ya Se (äºç)]]'s love interest.

As a child, he was kept in the dark from the public world and no one knew of his existence until he comes to the surface.

His loyalty to Dong Zhuo changes when he falls in love with Diao Chan and decides to help the Five Tiger Generals to keep her safe. However, his feelings waver when he finds out that Diao Chan has chosen Guan Yu over him, which Dong Zhuo uses to his advantage to sway him to his side again.

*''Taking the path of evil:''
In the 24th Round, after Diao Chan falls into a deadly slumber, Lu Bu uses a demonized technique (Zhen Cha Jing) learned from his father to heal her. Though successful, she still chooses Guan Yu over him, thus makes him take on a path of evil.

After a long time of practicing Zhen Cha Jing, with addition of Hao Cha Jing; an advanced demonic technique, his evil instincts and powers increase to an incredible point. When he overhears his father and brother-in-law's conversation, he finally discovers Dong Zhuo's true ambitions and develops deep hatred for those who betrayed him, allowing his evil intentions to take him over in order to exact vengeance on his father. He secretly forms his own army as part of his plot to take everything his father holds dear to himself, including the throne of school union leader.  However, he is unaware that his father is using his new siman to control him.

After Dong Zhuo takes over the imperial court, Lu Bu executes his plan to dethrone him, but instead he was double-crossed by his soldiers, who joined Dong Zhuo without his knowing. When the soldiers attempt to arrest him, however, he manages to escape.

During the battle, he observes from the side rather than participate. When he sees Diao Chan, the woman he still loves, and Dong Zhuo, the father he hates, fall into the ocean together, he loses his mind, along with his evil powers, prompting him to attack people anywhere he goes.

*''Love life:''
Lu Bu began dating [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Diao Chan (è²è¬)|Diao Chan]] after he rescued her from a kidnapping, though it was really a setup. Their relationship is ruined when Diao Chan finds that he is dating her because of his fatherâs orders, but they reconcile after he decides to betray his father to save her and The Five Tiger Generals (äºèå°). After he helped Diao Chan's friends awake her father, he regains her trust, but before she could thank him, she becomes a couple with Guan Yu, which devastates Lu Bu when he finds out. He respects her decision, however. He becomes furious when he finds out the truth behind her sudden change of personality and the side effects that follow, and he decides to win her back by healing the effects from her body. However, even after this, she still chooses with Guan Yu over him, thus breaks his heart again. From then on, he begins to take the path of evil, though he still retains feelings for her. It only takes her &quot;death&quot; to shock him.

'''Specialty:'''&lt;br&gt;
Lu Buâs weapon is a spear called âFang Tian Hua Jiâ (æ¹å¤©ç«æ / [[Sky Piercer]]).

His ultimate ambition is to dominate the world.

He thinks of [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Guan Yu (éç¾½)|Guan Yu (éç¾½)]] as a special kind of potential and hopes to become his friend.

Because [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Xiu (è©) / Liu Bei (åå)|Xiu (è©) / Liu Bei (åå)]] is always mysterious about what he knows, he is very suspicious of who he might be. He even goes to the point of co-operating with [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#Zhou Yu (å¨ç)|Zhou Yu (å¨ç)]] to discover who Xiu really is.

Though he is close friends with the [[List of K.O.3an Guo characters#The Five Tiger Generals (äºèå°)|Five Tiger Generals (äºèå°)]] Xiu is troubled by the knowledge from the [[Three Kingdoms]] (ä¸å), which tells him they may become enemies in the future.

Cao Cao's primary attack is &quot;Long Zheng Wan Li&quot; (é¾å¾è¬é), an attack that sends out powerful blue waves against his enemies. This power is known for blocking other people's powers.

In the 32nd Round, he demonstrates a new attack, &quot;Long Pan Hu Ju&quot; (é¾è èè¸), while fighting Dong Zhuo and Lu Bu. This attack works by Cao Cao directing his palms outward; the energy swirls around in circular motions while flying toward its target.
