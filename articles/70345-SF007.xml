'''Shareaza''' is a [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] client running under [[Microsoft Windows]] which supports the [[gnutella]], [[Gnutella2]] (G2), [[eDonkey Network|eDonkey]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[HTTP]] and [[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]] network protocols and handles [[Magnet URI scheme|magnet link]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Magnetlink.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.magnetlink.org/ | title=MagnetLink.org | publisher=MagnetLink.org | accessdate = 2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ed2k URI scheme|ed2k link]]s, and the now deprecated gnutella and Piolet links.&lt;ref name=&quot;Download.com: Shareaza&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.download.com/Shareaza/3000-2166_4-10136298.html?hhTest=1 | title=Download.com: Shareaza | publisher=Download.com | accessdate = 2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available in 30 languages.

Shareaza was developed by Michael Stokes&lt;ref name=&quot;Shareaza Goes Open Source&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story489_Shareaza_20_Released_Goes_Open_Source | title=Shareaza Goes Open Source | accessdate=2008-11-26 | publisher=[[Slyck.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; until June 1, 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shareaza Goes Open Source&quot;/&gt; and is now maintained by a group of volunteers. On June 1, 2004, Shareaza 2.0 was released, along with the source code, under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), making it [[free software]]. {{As of|2010|10}}, Shareaza ranks 12th on the SourceForge all-time download statistics.&lt;ref&gt;https://sourceforge.net/top/topalltime.php?type=downloads&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version, 2.5.5.0, was released on May 29, 2011.

== Features ==
=== Multi-network ===
Shareaza can connect to [[gnutella]], [[Gnutella2|G2]], [[eDonkey Network|eDonkey]] and [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. Shareaza [[Hash function|hashes]] its files for all networks, and then distributes those hash values on [[Gnutella2|G2]]. This allows Shareaza to download one file from several networks at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Shareaza features | url = http://shareaza.sourceforge.net/?id=tour }}&lt;/ref&gt; When another Shareaza client connected to [[Gnutella2|G2]] finds such a file, it is given the hash values for all networks and can search on the other networks with their respective hash values, which increases the number of sources and the download speed of the file. Shareaza also uses its G2 network to find more sources for torrents.

=== Security filter ===
The Shareaza client has some basic [[content filter]]s including a forced [[child pornography|child]] and optional [[pornography|adult pornography]] filter, and some other optional filters such as a filter for files encumbered with [[Digital rights management]] (DRM). Shareaza's security filters can also be extended with user-defined keywords and/or IP addresses. Latest versions of Shareaza allow for the use of [[regular expression]]s  and filtering by [[Hash function|hash]].
These filters increase the chances of getting the files the user wants and decrease the chance of getting malicious or fake files. The file format used for the filters is an extendable [[XML schema]]. The filters are editable inside Shareaza, and can be exported from the application to be shared with others.

=== Plugins ===
[[Image:Shareaza screenshot.PNG|thumb|300px|Shareaza running in windowed mode with several activated skins. On the picture can be seen a search window, a bandwidth graph, the upload queue window (uper-right corner) and the neighbours window (center), showing 4 gnutella, 3 Gnutella2 and an eD2k server connection.]]

Shareaza implements a framework for additional [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]]. The Shareaza installer ships several plugins. Most of them are used to read and strip off built in [[metadata]] from the files being hashed and convert it to an external XML based format, or to decode [[multimedia]] files for making a preview for other G2 clients. Some others serve the need of a [[media player (application software)|media player]] inside Shareaza, and enhancements of that media player. [[Third-party software component|Third party]] plugins can also be used, for example, ''Sharemonkey'', which will add a link inside Shareaza when downloading or searching copyrighted material from where it can be legally downloaded.

=== Skins ===
The client can have almost all parts of the [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] skinned. This includes bars, icons, as well as backgrounds and buttons. In that way, Shareaza can be completely changed with colors, images, new buttons, etc. A basic list of skins is contained in the Shareaza installer package. Other skins can be downloaded in the community forums or found via a search for .sks (Shareaza skin files) in the [[Gnutella2|G2]] network. The skins are [[ZIP (file format)|zip archives]], renamed with the [[Filename extension|extension]] .sks, containing icons and images, as well as an [[XML]] file which binds the images and colors with the GUI.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Shareaza skinning tutorial | url = http://shareaza.sourceforge.net/?id=skindocs/default }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This feature is also used for [[Internationalization and localization|localization]]. The language files are XML files, like the normal skins, but not zipped. The XML file contains the translations for a certain part of the program. This enables languages to be easily changed, updated and tested without compiling an entire [[Binary file|binary]].

=== Modes ===
Shareaza contains 3 user modes. The first one is for normal users. This mode is the default mode and provides a clean, trimmed GUI. Users will not be able to heavily change the settings in this mode, but will be able to make use of the most essential functions, like searching and downloading. The second mode is for [[power user]]s. It provides more access to network and advanced settings, but can also break your connection to the networks. The third mode is the windowed mode. In this mode, users can see different tabs (windows) simultaneously, providing a lot of control about the things happening. This mode also makes it possible to personalize the look of the client to perfectly fit the needs of the respective user.

=== IRC ===
Shareaza contains a built-in [[IRC]] (chat) client which allows users to communicate with each other. There are channels in several languages for support and help. These channels are located on the [http://www.p2pchat.net P2PChat servers] and can also by joined by any normal IRC client or via a [[Java (software platform)|Java]] addon on the Shareaza homapage.

== History ==
[[Image:Shareaza.png|thumb|140px|Logo of Shareaza version 1]]
In mid-2002 Stokes released the first version of a [[gnutella]] client he had written and dubbed &quot;Shareaza&quot;. It was from the beginning a client with the aim of having features other gnutella clients did not have.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Over the next two years Stokes coded in support for the [[eDonkey 2000 network]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and a rewritten gnutella-based protocol which he named [[Gnutella2]].

On June 1, 2004 Stokes released the Shareaza source code under version 2 of the [[GNU General Public License]] (which coincided with the release of Shareaza version 2.0). Shareaza joined [[LimeWire]], [[Gnucleus]], and others as an open source client on the gnutella network.

Since the beginning Shareaza was advertised as &quot;completely free. No ads, no spyware, no guilting you to upgrade to a commercial version&quot;, stating that the developers &quot;[couldn't] stand that kind of crap.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shareaza_archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.shareaza.com/ | title=Shareaza| publisher=Shareaza Development Group&lt;!-- see http://web.archive.org/web/20020707024715/www.shareaza.com/copyright.aspx --&gt;| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020628021209/http://www.shareaza.com/| archivedate=2002-06-28| accessdate = 2008-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained as such in each subsequent release.

From the first version Shareaza has supported [[swarm (downloading)|swarming]], [[metadata]], library management, and automatic [[Hash function|file hashing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shareaza_archive&quot; /&gt;

=== Domain takeover ===
On 19 December 2007 the project's [[domain name]], shareaza.com, was [[domain redirection|redirected]] to a site claiming to be &quot;The Official Home of Shareaza&quot;, promoting the download of a client known as Shareaza V4 (which had become V6 as of October 2009, V7 {{As of|2010|8|lc=on}}, and is V8 as of November 2011) unrelated to releases by the Shareaza development team,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = TorrentFreak - Shareaza.com Hijacked and Turned Into a Scam Site | url = http://torrentfreak.com/shareazacom-hijacked-and-turned-into-a-scam-site-071224/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[iMesh]] clone with only small graphical modifications, and using Shareaza v1 logo (see the picture above). This client is a network interface for a centralised music shop by Discordia Ltd., and does not connect to any open P2P network such as [[gnutella]], [[Gnutella2|G2]], [[eDonkey network|eDonkey]] or [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. Content is limited to the [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-protected music that can be bought in Discordia's online music store; Discordia is a company based in [[Cyprus]], closely related to the [[RIAA]] and unrelated to the Shareaza development team. In response the Shareaza development team moved their website to [[SourceForge.net]].

Versions prior to 2.3.1.0 of the original Shareaza connected to www.shareaza.com to check for software updates. From 1 January 2008 the new owner of the domain shareaza.com, Discordia Ltd.  used this update check mechanism to suggest to users that ShareazaV4 (and later ShareazaV5, V6, and V7) was an update to the original Shareaza client. Since version 2.3.1.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Heise-Security - Hostile takeover of Shareaza | url = http://www.heise-online.co.uk/security/Hostile-takeover-of-Shareaza--/news/101548 }}; {{ cite web | title = Secunia - Shareaza Updates Notifications Security Issue | url = http://secunia.com/advisories/28302/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; released on 3 January 2008, the original Shareaza has linked to the Shareaza pages at sourceforge.net.

[[Yahoo]], which uses [[SiteAdvisor]] to filter their search results,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = Yahoo Uses McAfee SiteAdvisor to Filter Evil Web Sites | url = http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/145517/yahoo_uses_mcafee_siteadvisor_to_filter_evil_web_sites.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; no longer lists domain shareaza.com due to it being listed by SiteAdvisor as a security risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = McAfee SiteAdvisor: Shareaza.com | url = http://www.siteadvisor.com/sites/shareaza.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[website reputation ratings|website reputation rating services]] , such as [[Web of trust]], also rate Shareaza.com as dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = WOT (Web of Trust) SiteAdvisor: Shareaza.com | url = http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/shareaza.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempted trademark registration ===
On January 10, 2008, the new owners of Shareaza.com, Discordia Ltd ([[iMesh]] Inc.), filed for trademark registration of the Shareaza name in an attempt to stop the original developers from using the name, claiming that the first-ever use was on December 17, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77368229 | title = Latest Status Info | publisher = [[US Patent and Trademark Office]] | accessdate = 2008-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Shareaza Development Team have obtained legal representation to challenge the registration and a legal defense fund has been set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://torrentfreak.com/shareaza-strikes-back-at-scammers-were-fighting-back-080510/ | title = Shareaza Stands Up To Scammers: &quot;We're fighting back!&quot; | publisher = [[TorrentFreak]] | accessdate = 2008-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Version history ===
'''v2.3.1.0'''&lt;br /&gt;
Version 2.3.1.0 is the last stable version of Shareaza that supports Windows 9x.&lt;ref name=&quot;win9x&quot;&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=565250&amp;group_id=110672 SourceForge.net: Comment on File: Shareaza v2.3.1.0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;v2.4.0.0&quot;&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://shareaza.sourceforge.net/ | title = Shareaza - Bringing P2P Together | publisher = Shareaza Development Team | accessdate = 2008-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed 2 days after the new owners of the project domain (see the [[#Domain takeover|shareaza.com domain takeover]]) exploited the updating mechanism to emit a false update message to trick users into installing their fake ShareazaV4 client. v2.3.1.0 is most notable for containing a fix for this security problem.

'''v2.4.0.0'''&lt;br /&gt;
Version 2.4.0.0 of Shareaza was released on October 1, 2008, with many [[bug fix]]es and major changes to provide better stability of the client. It is also the first stable release to include [[IRC]] support. Furthermore, major changes to the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrent]] handling mechanism have been made and [[Windows 98]]/[[Windows Me|Me]] support has been discontinued&lt;ref name=&quot;v2.4.0.0&quot; /&gt; (the last version working on Windows 9x is 2.3.1.0).&lt;ref name=&quot;win9x&quot; /&gt;

When v2.4 was released the roadmap for the next version (2.4.1.0, a v2.5 release candidate) was set for release around October 1, 2009, to be followed by 2.5.0.0 a month later.&lt;ref&gt;http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/shareaza/roadmap&lt;/ref&gt;

'''v2.5.x.0'''&lt;br /&gt;
Version 2.5.0.0 of Shareaza was released on October 31, 2009. It is significantly more stable and less resource-consuming than earlier versions. Also, it brings further improvements on the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] support, such as selective downloading of files contained in batch torrents and download prioritization. There have also been updates to the [[gnutella]] and [[eDonkey network|eD2k]] implementation, such as extended support for GGEP, large files and chat. The [[IRC]] implementation of v2.4.0.0 has been worked over and is now free of the bugs that made it partially unusable in the previous version. Also, download manager capabilities have been extended, [[Internet Explorer]] integration has been added and ''BugTrap'' has been included to speed up and simplify reporting crashes.

Version 2.5.1.0 of Shareaza was released on December 1, 2009. It was significantly more stable than its predecessor and more functional due to fixed bugs reported on 2.5.0.0. Improved usability  and compatibility of BitTorrent according to most popular service suggestions. It made use of and required the [[SSE]] instruction set, and thus required at least an [[Intel Pentium III|Pentium-III]] or an [[AMD Athlon XP|Athlon-XP]] processor.

Version 2.5.2.0 of Shareaza was released on February 6, 2010. It brought further improvements on stability. This and later versions were available optionally either as an SSE or non-SSE build to allow the use of older processors, unlike the SSE-only version 2.5.1.0. For this and later releases the SSE-optimized build uses [[SSE2]] and requires a [[Pentium 4]] or later, or [[AMD Athlon 64]] or later.

Shareaza v2.5.3.0, released on June 13, 2010, adds internal changes and optimizations; the only significant new feature is a new [[Scheduling (computing)|scheduler]] that allows full control over what the application does at a given time while running unattended.

Shareaza v2.5.4.0, released on February 12, 2011, improves the [[UPnP]] support and adds limited [[DC++]] support. Also, it features [[Î¼Torrent]] compatible [[peer exchange]], as well as tracker exchange for [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]. Also, it fixes remaining IRC chat bugs as well as a lot of rare crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/shareaza/index.php?title=ChangeLog2.5.4|title=ChangeLog2.5.4|work=Shareaza Wiki|publisher=[[SourceForge]]|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shareaza v2.5.5.0, released on May 29, 2011, features further improvements to the [[UPnP]] support, as well as [[DC++]] and [[gnutella]] updates, enhanced anti-spam protection during searches and multi-file download merging.

== Shareaza and Linux ==
Shareaza can be run under [[Linux]] using the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] compatibility layer. Although the media player does not work, uploading and downloading work flawlessly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;iId=1447 Shareaza entry in WineHQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are two software projects that focus on porting Shareaza's functionality to operating systems other than Windows. '''[[Sharelin]]''' is a Gnutalla2 client for Linux under development {{As of|2009|10|lc=on}}. It's not based on Shareaza and is not going to have support for [[P2P network]]s other than [[Gnutella2]], however it is linked to the Shareaza project as it is being developed as a SourceForge project by one of Shareaza's code contributors. The other project, named '''Quazaa''', focuses on developing a cross-platform multi-network client similar to Shareaza. It is based on the [[Qt (framework)|Qt framework]] and will enable connectivity to the Gnutella2, [[Ares Galaxy|Ares]] and eDonkey2000 networks, as well as be able to download from HTTP, FTP, and BitTorrent sources. It was in &quot;the early stages of development&quot; {{as of|2010|08|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quazaa.sourceforge.net/en/projectnews Quazaa (see Shareaza and Linux section) webpage; in &quot;the early stages of development&quot; in Aug10]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and reviews ==
* In November 2008, Shareaza was featured on [[SourceForge]] as ''Project of the Month''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sourceforge.net/community/potm-200811/ | title=Project of the Month, November 2008 | accessdate=2008-11-07 | publisher=[[SourceForge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In December 2009 Shareaza was ranked number 5 in SourceForge.Net's &quot;What's Hot for Windows?&quot; file sharing software ranking with 78% &quot;recommended&quot; (while number 1 was 81% &quot;recommended&quot;). {{As of|2010|8|24}} it was in the same position. The ranking is based on user recommendations and opinions and downloads of software from project site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/#filesharing | title=What's Hot for Windows? Filesharing | accessdate=2010-03-08 | publisher=[[SourceForge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
