==Acquaintances of Edie Britt==
The following characters are all family members and acquaintances of '''[[Edie Britt]]''', one of the protagonists of the series.

===Dave Williams===
'''Dave Williams''', previously '''David Dash''' ([[Neal McDonough]]) is a twice-widowed, mysterious man introduced in the [[You're Gonna Love Tomorrow|fifth season premiere]] as Edie's motivational speaker husband and the focus of the season's mystery. Dave convinced Edie to return to [[Wisteria Lane]] and persuade her tenant to move out. During their welcoming party, Edie learns the women forgive her for what happened instead of asking for her forgiveness. Annoyed by this, she asks Dave why he would force her to return to Wisteria Lane. Dave tells her that they can be happy here.

Dave learns that Edie was insulted by [[Karen McCluskey]], and is getting tired of the hostility towards her. Dave asks Mrs. McCluskey to apologize, but when she refused, her cat Toby mysteriously disappeared. She asks Dave to help her find him, and Dave tells her he might help if she apologizes to Edie. Karen promises reluctantly, and after she does, she notices that Toby is back at her house. Assuming that Dave was responsible, Karen tried doing some research on Dave, resulting in him making everyone think that Karen is going senile. Karen is temporarily sent to the hospital. On her release, she continues her research with her sister and they call Dr. Heller, Dave's psychiatrist. Meanwhile, Dave forms a garage rock band with [[Tom Scavo|Tom]], [[Orson Hodge|Orson]], [[Carlos Solis|Carlos]] and [[Mike Delfino|Mike]], who he helped move to the Lane in order to be closer to him. Dave arranges for the band to play at the &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; competition at &quot;The White Horse Club&quot;. Dr. Heller arrives in Fairview and learns that Mike, the man Dave is after, is in Dave's band. Dave strangles Dr. Heller in the club's storage room and sets the body ablaze, which later expands fire to the whole club. He later tells the police that [[Porter Scavo]] might have set the club on fire.

Dave constantly sees hallucinated visions of his wife and daughter, the people Mike and Susan accidentally killed in their car crash a few years back. Dave tells his dead family he will be with them soon. Edie catches Dave talking to himself in the middle of the night, and as she tries to understand what is going on, he attacks her. Edie kicks him out of the house. While leaving, Dave flashes back to when he learned he lost his family and how his anger got him admitted to a mental facility. He also remembers that when he got out, he met Edie and, after learning she used to live on the same street as Mike, married her. Mike sees Dave with his luggage and invites Dave to stay with him until things get better. Later, Edie realizes she does not want to be alone, and takes Dave back. Lee learns from Bob that Dave told the cops Porter set the fire to the club and tells Tom. Tom confronts Dave, and Dave explains that he had to tell the detectives what he thought he saw. Their friendship ends there.

Dave then plans a camping trip with Mike and Katherine, trying to trick Edie not to go and not to tell Katherine that she is not going. Edie and Dave are at a liquor store when a priest, recognizing Dave, comes up to them. Dave distracts Edie and tells the priest he does not want to recall his past. Edie finds this strange, and begins looking up Dave's past. In the camping trip which Dave arranged to exact his revenge on Mike by killing Katherine, his plan is botched when Edie texts him just as he was about to shoot Katherine, causing him to lose his aim. Edie had discovered his secret and demanded to confront him. Dave goes home and finds Edie, who reveals that she was now aware of his intentions. As she dials Mike's number to warn him, Dave grabs her by the throat. He almost strangles her, but releases her at the last moment. Tearful and disoriented, Edie rushes out and drives away in the car, but avoids running over Orson and collides with an electric post and receives a fatal shock, killing her in a matter of minutes. Dave later realizes that instead of Katherine it is M.J. he should have been trying to kill all this time in order to hurt Susan who was actually driving the car that killed his wife and daughter. When Jackson, Susan's boyfriend, returns, Dave fears he knows information from the incident in the club that he will tell the police. When he overhears a conversation that reveals Jackson is in the country illegally, he tips off immigration and gets Jackson arrested.

Dave makes one last attempt to take revenge on Susan by taking her and M.J. on a trip for fishing, while Mike discovers that Dave is really David Dash and his wife and daughter were killed in the car crash that broke up their marriage. Mike calls and warns Susan that Dave is a killer, and Susan and M.J. try to escape, but when Susan sprains her ankle, Dave catches her, and when M.J. is hiding, Dave bribes him. Back in the car, when Mike calls Susan back, Dave answers and reveals his intentions and is about to kill M.J. when Mike tells Dave to let Susan and M.J. go and to take him instead. Dave revises his plan and plans on making Susan watch as Mike hits the car with himself and M.J. in it, on the road of the accident because he thought it would be &quot;poetic&quot; to the protests of Susan, who asks Dave what his daughter would think of him killing an innocent child. His daughter reappears in the form of an hallucination and, as a result, Dave lets M.J. go. Mike crashes into Dave's car with only Dave in it, but both survive. Dave imagines what would have happened if his wife and daughter stayed home. After this confrontation, it is revealed that Dave was sent to a mental hospital in Boston, having clearly lost his mind.

===Umberto Roswell===
'''Umberto Roswell''' ([[Matt Cedeno]]) - Umberto is seen for the first time in the series' 100th episode, &quot;[[The Best Thing That Ever Could Have Happened]]&quot; during Edie's flashback remembering Eli Scruggs.

Umberto reveals he is gay and leaves Edie.  Eli, working in the bathroom, overhears the conversation and consoles Edie. A drunk Edie decides to cheer herself up by having sex with Eli.

'''Travers McLain''' ([[Jake Cherry]], season 3; [[Stephen Lunsford]], season 5) is Edie's son with her first husband Charles McLain. He lives with his father full time and was first mentioned in the pilot episode of the series, when he was said to be staying at Martha Huber's while Edie was &quot;entertaining&quot; a man. However he was never seen nor mentioned again until the sixteenth episode of the third season. His father Charles McLain left him with Edie whilst he went on a Doctors without Borders trip in Africa. Edie tried to leave Travers with Carlos while she went to a party, but as Carlos had a date, he declined. Seeing Travers playing by himself in the street, Carlos brings him to his home and later criticizes an intoxicated Edie for not supervising her son. She in turn reveals that she didn't take custody of him because she didn't feel she was capable of it and was being a realistic mother.

Later on Edie uses him as a way to get closer to Carlos and he is on to it the whole time but seems to take part in the plan willingly. Later in the episode, Edie and Carlos are in bed together. Edie's ex-husband, Charles, comes to pick up Travers. Edie tries to get shared custody of Travers when she suspects Carlos might be losing interest in their relationship. Charles learns about this and he and Edie get into an argument. Edie threatens to hire a lawyer so she can get full custody of Travers. Carlos learns of Edie's plan and tells her that she should think of what is best for Travers which is for him to stay with Charles and not have to go back and forth. He comforts her, saying that he will be there for her and Edie decides to call off her lawyer.

When Edie leaves Wisteria Lane for what she thinks is for good, she tells Travers she would have to spend Mother's Day with him. In fact, she would have to spend a lot more time with him from now on. Travers is next seen in season 5 when the Housewives visit him at Beecher's Academy (about 4 hours outside of Fairview) to inform him of his mother's death and to give him her ashes.

'''Austin McCann''' ([[Josh Henderson]]) is a troubled 17-year-old kid who was having problems with his mother's new boyfriend. When Edie, Austin's aunt, catches him trying to break into her house, she lets him stay with her for some time instead of going to [[Mexico]] like he was planning to, since he fought his mother's boyfriend, but she chose her boyfriend instead of Austin.

He is instantly attracted to [[Acquaintances of Susan Mayer#Julie Mayer|Julie Mayer]], and whilst she is also attracted to him, she doesn't immediately let him know. They spend some time playing cat and mouse but begin a relationship after both being held hostage by [[Carolyn Bigsby]], much to Susan's displeasure, as she considers him a trouble-maker, and fears he will break her daughter's heart. In episode 3.11, &quot;[[No Fits, No Fights, No Feuds]]&quot;, Julie gives up her virginity to Austin. Shortly afterwards, it was revealed that Austin had been sleeping with [[Danielle Van De Kamp]], who is also a friend of Julie's.

In episode 3.12, &quot;[[Not While I'm Around]]&quot;, Edie and Susan caught Austin and Danielle having sex.  At the end of the episode, Susan tells Julie about Austin and Danielle, and Julie is seen crying on her mother's shoulder. It's suspected that Julie's relationship with Austin is over, as well as Julie and Danielle's friendship. As of the episode &quot;I Remember That&quot;, it is established that Julie dumped Austin, as said by Edie to Tom Scavo when Edie broached him about hiring Austin for a job. This was later confirmed by Austin himself who proceeded to get high on the job, telling Lynette his reason was that &quot;Julie dumped me and I'm very.... very upset.&quot; Lynette fired Austin for smoking marijuana on the job, but Tom hired him back because &quot;teenage girls think he's hot...he'll bring in all the high school girls and half the men's chorus.&quot;

Later on he discovers that he got Danielle pregnant just when he managed to mend his relationship with Julie. [[Orson Hodge]] told Austin he would need to leave town. Although Austin refused, Andrew pointed out that sooner or later he would just hurt Julie again.

After this, Katherine tells him that she wants to patch things up with him but Adam guarantees that he will give her one last alibi, but then he is done with her.

In the season four finale, Adam and Katherine seemed to have re-kindled their marriage. They even go to Dylan's cello recital together, as a family. Since Adam had never seen a photo or ever met Wayne, he didn't know he was also at the recital. Wayne asked Adam during the intermission to help with some car trouble he was having. Wayne knocks Adam unconscious with a tire iron, takes him to an abandoned shack and beats him so badly that he thinks Adam has died. After Wayne leaves to deal with Katherine, Adam who had only feigned being dead, steals a car and heads to Wisteria Lane to save Katherine from Wayne. He shows up just as Wayne is about to shoot Katherine. The two men engage in an off-screen scuffle and Adam was successful in wrestling the gun away from Wayne. Bree then takes Adam to get cleaned up and he isn't seen after that, during which time Katherine is holding Wayne at gun point. He taunts her that even if gets jail time, he will come after her.  Bree and Adam hear a gunshot, and walk in to find Katherine over Wayne's body. In the 5-year leap, it is assumed that Katherine and Adam are divorced because there is no sign of Adam.

===Dylan Mayfair===
'''Dylan Mayfair''' ([[Lyndsy Fonseca]]) is Katherine's daughter, adopted from an [[orphanage]] in [[Romania]], and the adoptive maternal step-sister of the original Dylan, who was killed by a bookshelf. Dylan has no memory of &quot;her&quot; past life. So Dylan, her mother Katherine and her stepfather Adam move into Wisteria Lane and it is revealed that Katherine and Dylan lived there twelve years ago. Dylan finds a note that Katherine threw into the fireplace, which implies that Katherine killed Dylan's real father. Throughout Season 4, she unearths more surprising news about her past. She and Julie participate in the Founder's Day Ball.

One day, Dylan is driving, and a police officer pulls her over for speeding. Later, she finds out he is her father, Wayne, who she always thought had died. Wayne asks Dylan not to tell Katherine that they have met. Dylan meets Wayne a few times for dinner, telling Katherine that she's out on a date. Katherine follows Dylan one evening and discovers the truth. In fact, that night Dylan and Wayne resolve to tell Katherine that they have been meeting. When she hears the news, Katherine pretends she is no longer afraid of Wayne - but keeps a gun hidden under the counter. Wayne later discovers that Dylan is not his biological daughter. He realizes this after watching home videos of Dylan when she was young. Most striking is the fact that while his daughter had a scar from a bike accident that needed 11 stitches but Dylan's skin is unmarked. Katherine has no choice but to tell Dylan the truth about all the secrets she has kept her and she ran off when her dad came back with a gun.

Katherine says that Wayne abused her. She reported him to the police twice but because Wayne was a police officer, they &quot;lost the paperwork&quot; the first time. The second time, a policewoman advises Katherine to leave town so she packs her things and leaves with her daughter. Eventually, Wayne finds them but Katherine has gone out for the evening. When she returns, Mary Alice (who was babysitting) tells her that Wayne came by and gave Dylan a doll, which the little girl would not let go of. Katherine takes the doll and puts it on top of a bookcase. Wayne visits again and they have a fight, only ending when Katherine hits him with a candlestick so he leaves. Lillian offers Katherine a drink and she later falls asleep on the couch, waking up only when she hears a scream. She rushes upstairs and finds Dylan under the bookcase where Katherine had hidden the doll. Lillian says &quot;I came to see if she needed a blanket and found her - she is ice cold.&quot; The original Dylan is now dead. Katherine feels like she cannot go to the police because she believes Wayne will find a way to pin Dylan's death on her. She buries her daughter in the woods. She flies to a Romanian orphanage and adopts a girl who bears a striking resemblance to Dylan. The girl's biological mother had died in childbirth and her father had been murdered.

After the five year jump in the Season 4 finale, Dylan leaves a message for Katherine saying she has just returned from Paris, where her fiance proposed under the Eiffel Tower. In the fifth season Katherine reveals that Dylan has married and the she and her husband, Bradley, have had a baby. Katherine briefly thinks of leaving Wisteria Lane because Dylan informs her that her husband travels frequently and that she could use help with the baby. It is learned that Dylan and her family live in [[Baltimore]]. Katherine eventually turns down the offer due to her budding romance with [[Mike Delfino]].

She makes her return to Wisteria Lane when her mother intentionally stabs herself. Katherine claims that Mike was the one who stabbed her to get back at him for telling her he never loved her. When Susan tries to reason with Katherine she realizes that she needs serious mental help and upon learning that only a family member can commit someone to a mental institution, she calls Dylan, pretending to be a doctor, and tells her she should come to Fairview. Dylan returns and when Susan tries to talk to her Dylan is increasingly hostile and mean towards Susan. However, this is due to the fact that Dylan was under the assumption that Mike was married to her mother and that Susan was the one who stabbed her mother. After Susan shows Dylan her wedding album, Dylan realizes that her mother has been lying to her and living in delusion. When she visits her at the hospital she catches her in her lies and tells her that she has spoken to Mike and tells her that she knows Mike and Susan are married. Upon learning this Katherine goes into a full blown meltdown and both Susan and Dylan watch as she is restrained. Katherine then looks at her daughter and repeats the phrase, &quot;I asked you not to come&quot; as she breaks down in tears. There is no mention of her husband or baby.

===Wayne Davis===
'''Wayne Davis''' ([[Gary Cole]]) was a police officer, Katherine's first husband, and the father of the &quot;real&quot; Dylan. It is shown in flashbacks that he beat his wife and also had a drinking problem, causing Katherine to leave him. He spent twelve years trying to track Katherine and his daughter down and discovered Katherine is back on Wisteria Lane. He wanted a relationship with his daughter, or who he thought to be his daughter, until Katherine informed him that Dylan is not his child. Upon hearing this, he had a blood test done at the hospital under the guise of it being a [[homicide]]. The test results come back concluding that he is not Dylan's father. He tries everything in his power to find out what actually happened to his daughter, even threatening to kill Katherine so she would tell him. He then held Katherine hostage along with her best friend, Bree Hodge, until Katherine finally told him the truth about what happened to his daughter. It turns out that she was accidentally killed by a fallen bookshelf after Katherine placed the doll that he had bought her on the top shelf. Katherine and her aunt buried her in her backyard so Wayne would not convince the police that she had killed her in order to keep her from him and have them both arrested for murder. After this, she went to a Romanian orphanage and found a girl who looked a lot like her recently deceased daughter. Katherine then adopted the young girl and changed her name to Dylan Mayfair, to cover up the real death of her daughter, Dylan Davis. When he found this out from Katherine, he was going to kill her, until Adam, came to her rescue. After a fight between the two ensues, Wayne winds up shooting himself in the abdomen. Then as Bree goes to clean Adam up, Katherine is left holding a gun to Wayne, who lays conscious on the floor. As he lays there he tells her that he'll do some time in jail but his buddies will help him get out and that he'll come after her again. After realizing the truth in his statements, Katherine shoots him in the chest, killing him instantly.

For the first three seasons of the show, Mike rented the house. When Mike moved out, Mrs. Simms was convinced by Edie not to let Carlos rent her house. When Katherine moved in in the season four premiere, Katherine claimed that she is back on Wisteria Lane in order to care for her aunt. In the episode &quot;[[If There's Anything I Can't Stand]]&quot;, Lillian Simms comes to live in her home again to be cared for in her last days alive. Lillian arrived on a Saturday and the day she arrived she told Katherine that she had been feeling guilty and thought that Katherine and she should tell Dylan about what had happened twelve years earlier. Days later Lillian pretended to take a sleeping pill before Katherine left and then when she had thought that Katherine was gone she used the bell she was given to call Dylan to her room. When Dylan came into her room she tried to tell Dylan what happened and why Dylan did not remember living on Wisteria Lane twelve years ago. But Katherine arrived and sent Dylan away and then took the bell with her. Later that evening while Dylan was practicing her [[cello]], Lillian wrote a note, folded it and died while dropping the note on the floor. Lillian was taken away in an [[ambulance]] and her note went unnoticed as Katherine closed her auntâs door.

Susan manages to get Robin a job at her school but she is fired after it is revealed she used to be a stripper. Susan and Mike then invite Robin to stay with them. Robin accepts the offer but the other women of Wisteria Lane are less than pleased to have their husbands, boyfriends and sons leering at Robin. This causes them all to judge her prematurely, but they all later come around and see that Robin is genuinely a nice person and much more than a reformed stripper. Robin decides to become roommates with Katherine Mayfair, and the two become fast friends. After a night out together, Robin admits to being a [[lesbian]] and kisses Katherine. This confuses Katherine, but she ends up sleeping with her. Robin becomes frustrated as Katherine is unwilling to define their relationship, or show affection in front of the neighbors.

He goes to New York City to talk Ana about her supposed modelling job and reconects with his grandmother. It also reavealed that Patrick Logan is his biological father, but he does not know this and thinks of Nick as his real dad. However it is implied that Danny's inherited his father (Patrick's) violent and aggressive tendencies which Angie and Nick are trying to stamp out.
In episode 6x13 Ana reveals to Angie that Danny has a passion for poetry and writing which came as a surprise to Angie. When he meets Patrick in 6x19 he reveals to Danny that he is writing a novel to which Danny thinks is &quot;cool&quot; and the two strike an instant bond over the subject. It is clear that Danny's inherited Patrick's love for writing. However Patrick is writing a novel about how he and Angie first met and their story but Danny thinks it is all fiction. Patrick asks Danny's advice as to how the story of their family should end to which Danny replies that the guy should kill the girl. Patrick smiles almost proudly and says that killing her was his first instinct too, which shows how alike they are in many ways. The next day Patrick visits Danny again who memorizes his drink and asks if he was sticking around to which Patrick replied that he's not going anywhere until he's finished his &quot;book.&quot; Danny takes an interest to the plot and they talk about how it could end. Patrick basically tells Danny that it would be too easy to kill the girl (Angie) as he wants to get revenge on her for taking his kid. He reveals to Danny that he's going to take something from her to which Danny guesses &quot;the kid&quot; and seems excited by the idea, thinking it's all fiction and not knowing that it's him. In episode 6x21 Danny unknowingly reveals to Patrick that Nick will be out running later that night which makes it easier for Patrick to kill him, which he attempts to in a direct hit and run but Nick survives and ends up in hospital. He suspects instantly that Patrick Logan is in town and warns Angie that it's not safe and she should get Danny out of town. She gives Danny money to tide him over and tells him about Patrick Logan and the eco-terrorist group he started, but missing out the important fact of their relationship. Danny leaves against his will but Patrick breaks into his house when he's gone. He receives a text from Patrick pretending to be Angie and tells him to hurry home. He does so, much to the shock of his mother, late at night and she tells him to get out of the house, until Patrick turns on the light and says &quot;what's the rush?&quot; then points a gun straight at Danny. The three of them held in the same room together forces Angie to build Patrick his bomb. Meanwhile Patrick tells Danny the truth about his paternity and ties him up, calmly apologizes for doing so and reveals that he wants to have a traditional father, son relationship with him. Danny finds the whole thing half-funny, half-infuriating as he replies &quot;are you serious?&quot; Patrick and him both laugh before Patrick admits to how ridiculous he sounded and mentions that he'll untie him and they can get to know each other once he's finished doing something important. Danny furiously says &quot;if you ever untie me I'll kill you!&quot; to which Patrick dismisses as him being angry. He then tells him that he'll realize who he's really mad at. &quot;The guy who spent 20 years looking for you, or the people who spent 20 years lying to you?&quot; to which Danny realizes is true. His whole life is a lie. The end of episode 6x22 shows Patrick either untying or tying Danny, never taking his eyes off him while Danny tries not to cry. Danny is saved at the last minute by Gabrielle Solis while Angie kills Patrick with the bomb which was in the detonator. Later, while Angie and Nick relocate to Atlanta, Danny is seen relocating to New York to be with his grandmother and Ana Solis. During a tearful goodbye at the bus station Nick tells Danny he turned out a better man than he ever could have imagined. Danny responds by saying. &quot;If I am, it's because you were my father.&quot; This signals he never wanted anything to do with Patrick and still thinks of Nick as his father.

Danny ponders for a moment before replying that the guy should kill the girl to which Patrick wickedly replies &quot;funny, that was my first instinct too,&quot; meaning that he wanted to see how his son's opinion should affect his actions on Angie. He then waits outside Angie's house late at night but doesn't do anything. The next day Patrick visits Danny again who memorizes his drink and asks if he was sticking around to which Patrick replied that he's not going anywhere until he's finished his &quot;book.&quot; Danny takes an interest to the plot and they talk about how it could end.

He runs over Nick Bolen to get Angie. He gets her to make another bomb by threatening to take Danny's life and when he handcuffs Angie to her bed. He takes her cellphone pretending to be her telling Danny to come back home. It dawns on Danny that he is Patrick's kid when Patrick holds a gun to and later ties him up saying when its over. Patrick wants him and Danny to have a traditional father and son relationship. Danny replies &quot;Are you serious?&quot;, showing he wants nothing to do with him. But Patrick asks him to think about if he wants to live with someone who spent 20 years searching for him, or someone who spent 20 years lying to him.

Susan, visibly shaken by this, suggested he go to Utah and find Paul and gave him money to get there. Months later, after Felicia Tilman framed Paul Young for her murder, Paul begged Zach to ask his grandfather, Noah Taylor, for money to pay a lawyer, claiming it was for a car. Noah refused, telling Zach that he would not inherit his fortune because of Zach's supposed lack of bravery.

===Martha Huber===
'''Martha Huber''' ([[Christine Estabrook]]) lived at 4350 Wisteria Lane. She first appeared in the pilot episode as a nosey neighbour who discovered Mary Alice Youngâs suicide. After hearing a loud sound from her kitchen, she went to the Young house on the pretence of returning a blender, and found Mary Alice dead.

When Edie's house burns down, Martha discovers a measuring cup that Edie said wasn't her in the ruins, making Martha curious. When she finds a new measuring cup in Susan's groceries, she realises that Susan burned Edie's house down. Martha, currently suffering financial difficulties, consequently blackmails Susan. Susan and her daughter, Julie, break into Martha's home to retrieve the cup and destroy it.

It is revealed that while on a visit to her sister, Martha discovered that Mary Alice's real name is Angela Forrest and that she stole a baby in Utah, moving to Wisteria Lane to escape her past. Martha decides to solve her financial difficulties by blackmailing Mary Alice by letter but Mary Alice commits suicide after receiving it. Mary Alice's friends find the note when packing up her belongings and give it to Paul. He hires a private eye/hit man to discover who was responsible and kill them. Paul discovers Edie has the same stationery but Edie stole it while living with Martha.
Paul confronts Martha and she explains that she was desperate for money and Mary Alice killed herself because of &quot;what she did to that poor baby&quot;, Zach Young, whose true identity is Dana Taylor. In a rage, Paul kills Martha by bludgeoning her with the blender and strangling her. He then buries her next to a forest hiking trail.

It should be noted that twelve years after her murder, Paul finally confesses to the crime and is arrested. Her sister, Felicia, is presumably killed after driving into a semi-truck.

===Felicia Tilman===
'''Felicia Tilman''' ([[Harriet Sansom Harris]]) first arrives on Wisteria Lane in the [[Move On (Desperate Housewives)|eleventh episode]] of the first season to aid with the search for her sister [[#Martha Huber|Martha Huber]], who has gone missing. However, as Felicia informs Edie Britt upon her arrival, she knows that her sister is dead and has come to Wisteria Lane to discover who is behind her sister's murder.

After finding and reading Martha's journals, Felicia discovered that Martha was blackmailing Paul and Mary Alice Young because they had bought a baby named Dana from drug addict Deirdre Taylor and then moved to Fairview and changed the baby's name to Zach Young. Incidentally, Martha found this out from Felicia, who had worked in the same rehab center as Mary Alice did back in Utah. Felicia then realized that it was Paul who had murdered her sister as he had obviously found out that Martha was blackmailing Mary Alice and wanted to avenge his wife's suicide.  After revealing that she knows everything, Felicia tells Paul to leave town for good or she will expose Zach's true identity and the fact that he murdered Martha. Paul agrees to go but Felicia then informs him that Zach shall be staying with her from now on. Felicia then informs Zach that his father is not planning on coming back and that he shall be living with her. This then results in Zach attacking Felicia with a hockey stick which causes Felicia to fall down a flight of stairs, causing severe injury to her neck.

In season two, Felicia has been discharged from the hospital, but is still badly bruised and wearing a neck brace. Mike goes to visit Felicia to see if she knows where Zach is, as he has recently disappeared after failing to murder Mike. Felicia informs Mike that she does not know where Zach is and that she herself is going back to [[Utah]] for a few months to recuperate. Felicia then returns to Wisteria Lane a biological grandfather). Both Felicia and Mike comfort Zach after hearing the news that Paul has been killed, as Noah instructed Paul to be arrested and then killed in the back of an armored truck. However, Paul is revealed to be alive.

This results in Felicia planning her final act of revenge against Paul. After sneaking into his home through the backdoor, Felicia steals the spare key to Paul's house. Upon discovering her in his kitchen, Paul instructs Zach to throw out the food as Felicia may have tried to poison them both. Felicia then calls the police from her home and reports that Paul has been threatening her. Whilst phoning the police, she is in the process of pumping large quantities of her own blood from her body. The police inform Felicia that no action can be taken against Paul by just making threats, to which she replies that she will just have to deal with the problem herself. That following evening, Paul walks into his kitchen only to slip and discover blood on the floor and on the kitchen walls. The police quickly come upon the scene and place Paul in handcuffs when they discover two of Felicia's fingers in the trunk of his car. While Paul is escorted to prison, Felicia escapes to the mountains and retreats to a log cabin where she (with her hand heavily bandaged and missing two fingers) checks in under the alias of her dead sister &quot;Mrs.Huber&quot;. A flashback in the seventh season reveals that Karen McClusky knew all along Felicia had faked her death and kept it quiet.

Felicia Tilman returns in the seventh season premiere episode &quot;[[Remember Paul?]]&quot; It emerges that Felicia has been pulled over for speeding and was arrested for having no identification, prompting Paul to be freed. Felicia is sent to prison for eighteen months, where she is visited by [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]], who gloats that she is now in prison and he is now free. When Felicia accuses him of murdering her sister, he hangs 
up the phone, and through the [[plexiglass]], admits that he did, much to her surprise.. Back in prison, Felicia sticks up a newspaper cutting of Paul in her prison cell. Her roommate claims that he looks like a killer and says it is a shame he was released. &quot;It's all for the best,&quot; Felicia replies. &quot;Paul can receive the punishment he's entitled to. Just between us, Paul will be dead within six months.&quot; When her roommate asks how that's possible, she replies: &quot;Paul Young doesn't have friends on that street. I do.&quot;

In &quot;[[A Humiliating Business]]&quot;, it is revealed that Paul's new wife Beth Young is actually Felicia's daughter, when Beth visits her in prison. Felicia appears again in the following episode &quot;[[Sorry Grateful]]&quot;, In which she is disgusted to learn that Beth slept with Paul Young, in order to gain his trust. However, she instructs Beth to use it to her advantage, in order to gain proof that Paul did, in fact, murder her sister, [[Martha Huber]]. When Beth visits her again she tells her that she hasn't gained any evidence of Paul's misdeeds, but rather doubts her mother's mental stability, Felicia flys into an uncontrollable rage after learning that Beth is beginning to develop feelings for Paul, when she refuses to leave his house. Through Mary Alice's voice-over, we also learn that Felicia will not hesitate to punish both Beth and Paul, if Beth is 'stupid enough' to fall in love with him. It is also revealed in &quot;[[Sorry Grateful]]&quot; that Felicia's husband left her and Beth, when Beth was at an early age. Since then, contrary to tradition on [[Thanksgiving]], Felicia and Beth never shared a meal with anyone, let alone each other. The reason being that Felicia felt there was nothing to be thankful for, and refused to allow a male classmate of Beth's into the house. In [[Assassins (Desperate Housewives)|Assassins]], Beth questions Felicia to know if she had anything to do with Paul being shot. Felicia denies but secretly calls Mike, assuming he accepted an offer she made to take care of Paul. Meeting her at the prison, Mike tells Felicia he had nothing to do with it, making her wonder who could have been the shooter. When Paul confronts Beth and kicks her out of the house, revealing he did murder Martha, Beth goes to Felicia to talk about it. However, Felicia dismisses Beth as being a fool for not getting the confession on tape, dismisses her as useless and tells the guards to remove her daughter from the visitor list.

When Beth shoots herself, Felicia has Paul visit her in prison, grief-stricken that the war between them has claimed her daughter's life. She says it's time for Paul to let Beth go and for both of them to put the fight behind them. At the end of the episode, Felicia is told that because of her personal tragedy, the parole board has granted her a release. Felicia smiles secretly, hinting that she plans to use her freedom to get at Paul. It turns out that Paul had put Katherine Mayfair's old house in Beth's name when he purchased it, and thus Felicia inherits it upon her release. She talks Paul into taking her out to a lake to scatter Beth's ashes. Paul brings a gun for protection but Felicia manages to get it away from him and holds it on him, saying she could shoot him and plead self-defense. Instead, she throws the gun in the lake and tells Paul it's time to let the hate go. They scatter the ashes and then leave. However, at her new home, it's revealed Felicia kept the real ashes and tells Beth's real ashes that she'll take revenge on Paul in a much more satisfying way than just shooting him. She tells Karen McCluskey that Paul knew who Beth was all along and seduced her to get at Felicia, driving her to suicide. Convinced, Karen tells Felicia she'll help her keep an eye on Paul. 

When Felicia begins to poison Paul's food (by sabotaging meals that Susan has been cooking for him), Paul suspects that Susan is trying to kill him and has her arrested, but when the police suspect that Felicia was the culprit afterall, they contact her to come to the police station for questioning. This causes Felicia to flee from Wisteria Lane. After Paul is convinced of Susan's innocence, he decides to move out of the lane and give Susan her house back.  However, as he is about to leave, he is knocked unconscious by Felicia. When Paul awakens that night, Felicia has bound him to a chair and hooked him to an antifreeze drip which slowly weakens and poisons him; although Felicia has an extra syringe filled with potassium chloride that she will plunge into Paul's chest if he tries to yell for help, which will kill him instantly. However, Susan comes by the house and discovers Paul being tortured. She calls the police and distracts Felicia by using a toy police car and activating its siren, tricking Felicia into thinking that the police were coming for her. As Felicia briefly flees, Susan helps cut away some of  Paul's bindings, but when Felicia realises that she's been tricked, she returns and attacks Susan, attempting to kill her with the potassium chloride syringe. Paul, finally breaking free, quickly pushes Felicia of Susan and into the wall, where he begins to strangle her; a scene eerily similar to Martha's death. However, Susan manages to convince Paul that he's not a killer and Paul finally lets Felicia go. Felicia then escapes the house with her daughter's ashes avoiding capture from the police. 

While driving down the highway the next morning, Beth's ashes spill and cause Felicia to lose control of her car.  She is last seen about to crash head-on with a semi-truck, and is presumed to have died in the collision.

===Beth Young===
'''Beth Young''' (nÃ©e '''Tilman'''; [[Emily Bergl]]) was Paul Young's second wife introduced in &quot;[[You Must Meet My Wife]]&quot;. Beth met Paul while writing to him in prison where he was serving time for the apparent murder of Felicia Tilman. She arrives on [[Wisteria Lane]] distressed and lost, looking for Paul. Paul tells her that the letters she wrote to him kept him going and since he was not allowed conjugal visits, this is like their wedding night. However Beth did not want to rush into sex. Paul doesn't listen and later that night he brings her a gift that is wrapped away in a shopping bag. Beth is shocked that it is lingerie and she says to him that she thought they were going to take it slowly. Paul gets her to read a letter she wrote to him, but Beth gets wound-up and said it was just fantasy. She then blurts out 'I thought you would stay in prison. Paul is instantly made upset by this remark. Paul kisses her on the head and tells her that he will not be patient forever.

In &quot;[[Truly Content]]&quot; Susan, Lynette and Bree show up at Beth and Paul Young's house. They invite Beth to their weekly poker game. Paul asks her what Susan, Lynette and Bree wanted. Beth replies saying that they invited her to play cards with them, and that they were just being friendly, Paul says to Beth to never confuse being nosey to being friendly, saying that they were digging for dirt. Beth asks Paul if he does not want her to go, to which he replies that she will go and hopefully later they will start to become friends. He adds that it will be useful in time. 

During a poker game, Beth talks to the other five housewives about her life when she was younger. Beth says that when she was eight her father left her mother, and that they were pretty much alone, saying that most of her friends were either stuffed or plastic. Then Beth talk about her mothers boyfriends, but says that as soon as she learned their names that her mother would kick them out, and that there would be a new toothbrush in the bathroom. When everyone looks at her strangely and puzzled Beth asks to let her know if she is sharing too much, which causes Susan to say no, but whisper to Lynette, who is sitting next to her saying that Beth is cracking like an egg. Beth later says that she saw Paul's picture at trial, and that there was just something about his eyes that she really liked and spoke to her. Susan asks if the headline &quot;Arrested For Murder&quot; did not speak to Beth, which she admits gave her a pause, but that then Beth and Paul started corresponding while he was in jail behind bars, and that she discovered what a wonderful man Paul really is, which gives everyone the shivers. Beth tells Renee that you cannot help who you fall in love with, and jokes that Paul is a real lady killer. They all stare at her as if she is crazy. Beth says that in her heart she always knew that Paul was innocent, and that she was correct for thinking that.  

Beth asks Karen McCluskey why she does not like her husband, Paul. Mrs. McCluskey says that people think he is a murderer. Beth says that he was exonerated and that Felicia Tillman framed him, and Karen McCluskey reveals that everyone's blaming Paul for the murder of Felicia's sister, Martha Huber.  

Beth tells Paul she had a lovely time at the poker game. He asks what the neighborhood is saying about him. Beth says, that a bunch of people think that he killed Martha Huber. Paul tells her that she should know that he is not a murderer. Beth tells him that she knows, but that she fell in love with him before she knew that, and that even if he was that she is always going to be on his side, she also tells him that no matter if he is innocent or not, she would still love him, and that he should remember that. When Beth refuses to sleep with Paul, she eventually reveals she is a virgin and her continuing refusal makes her demand she leave him. When Susan discovers Paul got her fired from her job as a teacher, she attacks him in his home  and Beth pulls a gun on her to make her leave. Realizing how his wife aided him, Paul kisses her and they end up in bed. 

Beth is worried about Paul's plans for Wisteria Lane. When his former cellmate moves into the neighborhood, Beth threatens to tell people he attacked her unless he tells her Paul's plans. She meets Paul at home in sexy underwear, revealing what she knows but she supports him, saying she knows all about revenge. It is soon revealed that Beth is actually Felicia Tilman's daughter, aiding her mother in revenge on Paul. After she and Paul sleep together, Beth questions her mother's sanity and if she knew for certain Paul killed her sister, the two women have a fight, Beth leaves. When Paul is shot later in the season, Beth returns to jail, convinced her mother had something to do with it but Felicia is honestly surprised to hear it happened. Unknown to Beth, the detectives investigating the shooting told Paul how she was Felicia's daughter, making him realize how she has been using him all along. While Paul develops hatred for Beth, Beth falls in love with Paul, and has turned against Felicia to support Paul. After a confrontation with Zach, Paul realizes that &quot;no one can ever love him&quot; and decides to kick Beth out of the house. Beth confesses her love to Paul but he remembers what Zach told him, and doesn't listen to her, he closes the door on her face, leaving her with nowhere to go. Beth tries to get back with Paul, telling him how she believed her mother's claims of Paul killing her aunt but now that she knows him, doesn't believe it. She's thus shocked when Paul confesses to having killed Martha after all. Beth goes to see Felicia in prison where her mother berates her for being so stupid as to not get the confession on tape and that Beth is useless to her, telling the guards to remove her daughter from the visitor list. Bree comes to Beth's motel to reveal they're both a match to be a kidney donor for Susan but Bree wants to do it in order to feel needed. With nothing else left in her life, Beth goes to the hospital and makes sure the nurse in the waiting room files the paperwork ensuring her kidney will go to Susan. Beth then pulls a gun out of her purse and shoots herself in the head, leaving her brain dead.

Told of Beth's shooting, Susan and the other women are thrown as Beth is on life support, declared brain dead. Paul is shown to be affected by all this, telling Susan that he will not let Beth go and won't allow her to take his wife's kidney. Felicia meets Paul in prison, saying that their battle cost them Beth's life and she truly loved Paul. In the end, Paul decides to let Susan have the kidney and mourns his wife. Felicia Tilman, Beth's mother, is released from prison at the end of the episode, and decides to get revenge on Paul for murdering Martha, and for the death of her daughter.
