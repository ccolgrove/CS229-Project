'''Colorado State University''' (also referred to as '''Colorado State''' and '''CSU''') is a public [[research university]] located in [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], [[Colorado]]. The university is the state's [[Morrill Act|land grant]] university, and the [[flagship university]] of the Colorado State University System.

The {{As of|2004|alt=current}} enrollment is approximately 29,932 students, including resident and non-resident instruction students. &lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado State University Fact Book 2010â2011&quot;/&gt; The university has approximately 1,540 faculty in eight colleges and 55 academic departments. Bachelor's degrees are offered in 65 fields of study, with Master's degrees in 55 fields. Colorado State confers doctoral degrees in 40 fields of study, in addition to a professional degree in veterinary medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado State University Fact Book 2010â2011&quot;/&gt;

CSU received more than $300 million in sponsored research in 2010, ranking the university in the top 3 percent of institutions without a medical school for research expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.com/index.php/article/2010/09/092110_research |title=RMSMC :: Colorado State University surpasses $300M in research expenditures |publisher=Collegian.com |date=2010-09-21 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Colorado State University is a land-grant institution classified as a Carnegie Doctoral/Research University-Extensive. CSU was founded as Colorado Agricultural College in 1870, six years before the Colorado Territory gained statehood. It was one of 68 land-grant colleges established under the Morrill Act of 1862. Doors opened to a freshman class of 5 students in 1879.

The university has operated under four different names:
* 1879: '''Agricultural College of Colorado'''
* 1935: '''Colorado College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts''' ('''Colorado A&amp;M''')
* 1944: '''Colorado Agricultural and Mechanical College''' ('''Colorado A&amp;M''')
* 1957: '''Colorado State University'''

===Early years===
Arising from the [[Morrill Act]], the act to create the university was signed by [[Colorado Territory]] governor [[Edward M. McCook]] in 1870. However, during its first years the university existed only on paper. While a board of 12 trustees was formed to &quot;purchase and manage property, erect buildings, establish basic rules for governing the institutions and employ buildings,&quot; the near complete lack of funding by the territorial legislature for this mission severely hampered progress.

The first {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land for the campus was deeded in 1871 by Robert Dazell. In 1872, the Larimer County Land Improvement Company contributed a second 80-acre (320,000 mÂ²) parcel. The first $1000 to erect buildings was finally allocated by the territorial legislature in 1874. The funds were not sufficient, however, and trustees were required to find a matching amount, which they eventually obtained from local citizens and businesses.

[[Image:Colorado Agricultural College Campus, 1920.jpg|thumb|right|Colorado Agricultural College Campus, 1920 with the Oval, Physics Building, and Guggenheim Hall showing.]]
Among the institutions which donated matching funds was the local [[National Grange|Grange]], which was heavily involved in the early establishment of the university. As part of this effort, in the spring of 1874 Grange No. 7 held a picnic and planting event at the corner of College Avenue and West Laurel Street, and later plowed and seeded 20 acres (80,000 mÂ²) of [[wheat]] on a nearby field. Within several months, the university's first building, a {{convert|16|ft|m|sing=on}}-by-24-foot red brick building nicknamed the &quot;Claim Shanty&quot; was finished, providing the first tangible presence of the institution in Fort Collins.

After [[Colorado]] achieved statehood in 1876, the territorial law establishing the college was required to be reauthorized. In 1877, the [[Colorado General Assembly|state legislature]] created the eight-member [[Colorado State Board of Agriculture|State Board of Agriculture]] to govern the school. Early in the 21st century, the governing board was renamed the Board of Governors of the Colorado State University System. The legislature also authorized a railroad right-of-way across the campus and a [[mill levy]] to raise money for construction of the campus' first main building, Old Main, which was completed in December 1878. Despite wall cracks and other structural problems suffered during its first year, the building was opened in time for the welcoming of the first five students on September 1, 1879 by university president [[Elijah Evan Edwards]].

During Colorado Agricultural College's first term in fall 1879, the school functioned more as a college-prep school than a college because of the lack of trained students. Consequently, the first course offerings were arithmetic, English, U.S. history, natural philosophy, horticulture and farm economy. Students also labored on the college farm and attended daily chapel services. The spring term provided the first true college-level instruction. Despite his accomplishments, Edwards resigned in spring 1882 because of conflicts with the State Board of Agriculture, a young faculty member, and with students.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, James E. ''Democracy's College in the Centennial State: A History of Colorado State University''. Colorado State University: Fort Collins 1977, pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The board's next appointee as president was Charles Ingersoll, a graduate and former faculty member at Michigan Agricultural College, who began his nine years of service at CAC with just two full-time faculty members and 67 students, 24 of whom were women.
[[File:CSU The Oval4.jpg|thumb|The Oval today, leading towards the Administration Building]]

====President Charles Ingersoll====
Agricultural research would grow rapidly under Ingersoll. The Hatch Act of 1887 provided federal funds to establish and maintain experiment stations at land-grant colleges. Ainsworth Blount, CAC's first professor of practical agriculture and manager of the College Farm, had become known as a &quot;one man experiment station&quot;, and the Hatch Act expanded his original station to five Colorado locations.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The curriculum expanded as well, introducing coursework in engineering, animal science, and liberal arts. New faculty members brought expertise in botany, horticulture, entomology, and irrigation engineering. CAC made its first attempts at animal science during 1883â84, when it hired veterinary surgeon George Faville. Faville conducted free weekly clinics for student instruction and treatment of local citizen's diseased or injured animals.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Veterinary science at the college languished for many years following Faville's departure in 1886.

President Ingersoll believed the school neglected special programs for women. Despite the reluctance of the institution's governing board, CAC began opening the door to liberal arts in 1885, and by Ingersoll's last year at CAC the college had instituted a &quot;Ladies Course&quot; that offered junior and senior women classes in drawing, stenography and typewriting, foreign languages, landscape gardening and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Ingersoll's belief in liberal yet practical education conflicted with the narrower focus of the State Board of Agriculture, and a final clash in April 1891 led to his resignation. In 1884, CAC would celebrate the commencement of its first three graduates.

===Turn of the 20th century===
[[Image:CACAdvt.jpg|thumb|right|Colorado Agricultural College advertisement]]
Alston Ellis encountered limited funding and decided rapidly in 1895 to reduce the number of Experiment Stations. Female students grew in number from 44 in 1892 to 112 in 1896, and by fall 1895, the college's new domestic-economy program was in place.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 110&lt;/ref&gt; [[American football|Football]] had a one-year stint at CAC in 1893, but Ellis was not a supporter of extracurricular activities and was especially hostile towards football.

Barton Aylesworth became the school's fourth president in 1899, and the combination of his non-confrontational style with the presence of the vocal Colorado Cattle and Horse Growers Association on the governing board allowed ranching and [[farming]] interests to take the college's agricultural programs to new heights, greatly influencing the development of the entire school. Initially, the influence of [[ranching]] interests brought tremendous progress to CAC's agricultural programs. Enrollment quadrupled, studies in veterinary medicine were re-established, and CAC's Experiment Station benefited from lobbying that finally secured state appropriations. Eventually, conflicts with agricultural interests may have prompted Aylesworth to begin promoting a more balanced curriculum at CAC, which he then fought hard to defend. The conflict also led him to tire and negotiate his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Hanses, James E. ''Colorado State University Campus: Ringing Grooves of Change, 1870â1973''. Colorado State University: Fort Collins, 1973. Pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Aylesworth was a big supporter of extracurricular activities. Football returned to the college in fall 1899, but [[baseball]] was the school's most popular sport. In 1903, the women's basketball team won CAC's first unofficial athletic championship, culminating with a victory over the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 143&lt;/ref&gt; New clubs, fraternities, and sororities also emerged. By 1905, the school had a fledgling music department, which two years later became the Conservatory of Music.

===President Charles Lory===
Taking office in 1909, CAC President Charles Lory oversaw the school's maturation and reconciled longstanding conflicts between supporters of a broad or specialized curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Colorado State University Campus''. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He embarked on a demanding schedule of personal appearances to make Colorado Agricultural College known as an institution that served the state's needs. Another of Lory's notable achievements was putting the school on solid fiscal ground, meeting rising construction costs and freeing the institution of debt.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of [[World War I]] influenced all aspects of CAC, but nowhere was the impact more apparent than in the institution's programs for farmers. [[World War I]] created demands for American agricultural products, and CAC established new food production committees, information services and cultivation projects to help improve food production and conservation in Colorado. [[World War I]] also drew men from campus to Europe's battlefields. In June 1916, the National Defense Act created the [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]]. A few months later CAC applied to establish an [[ROTC]] unit in [[Fort Collins]] and resurrected a defunct [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] unit on campus.

During the early 1930s, CAC's community-wide activities were greatly influenced by the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]]. The Extension Service organized relief programs for inhabitants of Eastern Colorado, of whom a survey found 20,000 to be urgently in need of food, and helped sustain cropland threatened by pests and drought.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; President Lory sought to help [[Colorado]] farmers by pushing for major tax reforms to relieve them of high tax burdens, and played a significant role in a 1930s project that supplied [[irrigation]] water for agricultural development in Eastern Colorado.

Lory and the State Board had challenges of their own back on campus. In response to claims that the university was falling behind national standards, the board retired or demoted several senior professors and administrators deemed past the peak of their proficiency, and hired new doctorate-holding personnel while consolidating sections of lecture courses.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 313&lt;/ref&gt; A student petition led to the governing-board to change the college's name to more accurately reflect the diversity of its academic programs, and in 1935 the school became the Colorado State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, or Colorado A&amp;M. After 31 years of leadership, President Lory announced his retirement in 1938.

===From World War II into the modern era===
Soon after [[Pearl Harbor]], Colorado A&amp;M began to look like a military post, with the college serving as many as 1,500 servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 348&lt;/ref&gt; New President Roy Green tried to prepare for the sudden departure of students and arrival of servicemen by improving ROTC facilities, and introducing military-training programs. Although servicemen filed onto campus, student enrollment at Colorado A&amp;M, 1,637 in fall 1942, dropped to 701 by fall 1943, and female students outnumbered their male counterparts for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College.'' 349&lt;/ref&gt; When the war ceased in 1945, soldiers returning from Europe and the Pacific filled U.S. higher-education institutions. Nearly 1,040 students attended the college in fall 1946, and about 1,600 students enrolled by spring 1946. Close to 80 former Aggies died in [[World War II]] including football talent Lewis &quot;Dude&quot; Dent.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College.'' 350&lt;/ref&gt; President Green did not live long enough to enjoy more stable days at Colorado A&amp;M, his life taken by a heart attack in 1948.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

====Colorado A&amp;M becomes a University under Bill Morgan====
Colorado A&amp;M shed its image as a narrow technical college and became a university in appearance and title during the 1950s under president Bill Morgan. Providing adequate student housing for an increasing number of youth approaching college age and improving cramped instructional facilities were among the first tests of Morgan's leadership. He responded, and five new residence halls were completed between 1953â1957.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Colorado State University Campus''. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado A&amp;M took advantage of a new mill levy won through aggressive lobbying to construct several new academic facilities, among them Morgan Library, completed in 1964.

Academic offerings grew to include advanced degrees. The State Board of Agriculture approved a doctoral degree in civil engineering in 1951, and three years later allowed other qualified departments to offer doctorates. Morgan believed students earning this advanced degree should hold it from a university, and so began a campaign to change the name of Colorado A&amp;M. In 1957, the [[Colorado General Assembly]] approved the new name of Colorado State University.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Colorado State University Campus''. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 1960s: Student activism====
Colorado State became a scene of intense student [[activism]] during the 1960s and early 1970s. The reduction of strict campus regulations for women was among the early targets of student activists, coming to the forefront in 1964 when a 21-year-old female student moved into unapproved off-campus housing to accommodate her late hours as editor of the student newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 447&lt;/ref&gt; Continual student protests eventually led to the loosening of curfews for women and the opportunity for junior and senior coeds to live off campus.

The civil-rights movement on campus also picked up momentum and visibility. In spring 1969, shortly before Morgan's retirement, Mexican-American and African-American student organizations presented a list of demands to university officials primarily urging increased recruitment of minority students and employees. The demonstrators' occupation of the Administration Building continued to the front lawn of Morgan's home. Students and university representatives took their concerns to state officials, but Colorado legislators rejected a subsequent university request for funds to support minority recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 462&lt;/ref&gt; Civil rights tension resurfaced in January 1970 during a peaceful student demonstration before a Colorado State-Brigham Young University basketball game in protest of alleged racist practices of the [[LDS Church]]. The demonstration became violent and clashes with riot police ensued.

Anti-military protest took place in dramatic form at Colorado State from 1968â70. On March 5, 1968, several hundred students and faculty with anti-war sentiments marched to Fort Collins' downtown War Memorial and wiped blood on a placard tied to the memorial. Hecklers and blockaders created such a disturbance that police had to disperse the non-marchers. In May, 1970, as campus peace activists held the second day of a student strike in the gymnasium in response to the U.S. invasion of [[Cambodia]] and the student deaths at [[Kent State University]], one or more arsonists set Old Main ablaze, destroying the 92-year-old cornerstone of Colorado State.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Democracy's College''. 469&lt;/ref&gt;

====The 2000s: CSU under President Penley====
In his welcoming address for the fall 2007 semester, former CSU President Larry Edward Penley called for CSU to set the standard for the 21st century public land-grant [[research university]].&lt;ref name=&quot;president.colostate.edu&quot;&gt;[http://www.president.colostate.edu/index.asp?page=speech_2007_fall_address President Penley's Fall 2007 Address] Fort Collins, Colorado. September 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He has identified as the heart of this ideal the contribution to the prosperity and quality of life of the local and international community, in part through fostering relationships and collaborations with federal research partners, the business community and key industries.&lt;ref&gt;''Setting the Standard for the 21st century: Strategic Directions. Strategic Plan 2006â2015''. Office of the President, Colorado State University. February, 2006. pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; A part of this approach is Colorado State's new Supercluster research model, designed to utilize interdisciplinary, issue-based research on pressing global issues in which the [[university]] has particular expertise and connect research results to the marketplace. Initial Superclusters in [[infectious disease]] and in [[cancer research]] have been launched, and an upcoming [[clean energy]] Supercluster dovetails with an overall emphasis on campus sustainability. A [[wind farm]] is being built to power the main campus, and new residence halls have been constructed according to national [[green building]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Trevor. &quot;CSU Trying to Conserve Amid Building Boom.&quot; ''Fort Collins Coloradoan''.&lt;/ref&gt; A sustainability advisory committee has been charged to coordinate green activities at Colorado State.&lt;ref&gt;''Comment Quarterly''. Colorado State University. Fall 2007. Issue 2, Volume 1. pg 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

While maintaining historic ties to local [[agriculture]], administration officials have also emphasized the desire to better connect with the local community.&lt;ref&gt;''Setting the Standard for the 21st century: Strategic Directions. Strategic Plan 2006â2015''. Office of the President, Colorado State University. February, 2006. pg 10&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, CSU is party to UniverCity, a multi-organization initiative that links the school with city government, community and business associations to expand and synchronize working relationships.&lt;ref&gt;''Comment Querterly'', pg 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Another goal set by the university is to improve undergraduate education. Essential tasks, according to Penley, are access and graduation rates, particularly for qualified low-income and minority students, and an education international in scope suited to a global economy.&lt;ref&gt;''Setting the Standard for the 21st Century''. pg 4&lt;/ref&gt; Facilities improvements underway include a new biocontainment research lab, a campus center for the arts, and a new [[computer science]] building. With state financial support declining, CSU has also put a focus on alternate funding models based on market-based financial strategies and increased forms of private support. Marketing and public relations have also become part of university strategy to attract quality students and increase public awareness of Colorado State.

==Campus==
[[Image:CSULagoon.jpg|thumb|alt=View of the Lagoon and Rec Center.|The Lagoon, Rec Center, and Intramural Fields.]]
Colorado State University is located in Fort Collins, Colorado, a mid-size city of approximately 142,000 residents at the base of the Rocky Mountains. The university's {{convert|583|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} main campus is located in central Fort Collins, and includes a {{convert|101|acre|km2|sing=on}} veterinary teaching hospital. CSU is also home to a {{convert|1438|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} Foothills Campus, a {{convert|1,575|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} agricultural campus, and the {{convert|1177|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} Pingree Park mountain campus. CSU utilizes {{convert|4,043|acre|km2|1}} for research centers and Colorado State Forest Service stations outside of Larimer County.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado State University Fact Book 2010â2011&quot;/&gt;

===Main campus===
At the heart of the CSU campus lies the Oval, an expansive green area {{convert|2065|ft|m}} around, lined with 65 [[American Elm]] trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tour.colostate.edu/oval.html?general-1 Campus Tour, The Oval.] Colorado State University website, accessed November 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Designed in 1909, the Oval remains a center of activity and a major landmark at CSU. The Administration Building, constructed in 1924, faces the Oval from the south end, while several academic and administrative buildings occupy its [[perimeter]]. The Music Building, once the university [[library]], currently houses the Institute for Learning and Teaching, which provides academic and career counseling as well as other student-focused programs. The music department moved to the University Center for the Arts upon its opening in 2008. [[File:CSU The Oval.jpg|thumb|left|The Oval, at the heart of the CSU campus]] At the northeast corner of the Oval is Ammons Hall, formerly the women's recreational center and now home to the University Welcome Center. Just to the east of Ammons stands Guggenheim Hall, which currently houses the Department of Manufacturing Technology and Construction Management. The building was constructed in 1910 as a gift from U.S. Senator Simon F. Guggenheim to promote the study of home economics,&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Colorado State University Main Campus''. pg 19&lt;/ref&gt; and was recently renovated according to [[green building]] standards. Rounding out the Oval are the Weber Building, the Statistics Building, the Occupational Therapy Building, and Laurel Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado State University Campus Character&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fm.colostate.edu/character/index.cfm?page=eras/oval|title=Colorado State University Campus Character|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another campus focal point is the main plaza, around which can be found Lory Student Center and Morgan Library, as well as several academic buildings. The Lory Student Center, named for former CSU president Charles Lory, houses Student Media, numerous organization offices, Student Government, and spaces to eat, drink and study. The Morgan Library was originally constructed in 1965 and named for former CSU president William E. Morgan. Following the flood of '97, this facility went through an extensive improvement project that included an addition to the main building and a renovation of the existing structure, with works completed in 1998 . Current holdings include more than 2 million [[books]], bound journals, and government documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado State University Fact Book 2010â2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ir.colostate.edu/factbook-fb.html|title=Colorado State University Fact Book 2010â2011|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan Library is currently undergoing a 13,000 square-foot addition and renovation project designed to provide more seating, computing and study space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fm.colostate.edu/projects/index.cfm?page=projects/library |title = Facilities Management Projects |accessdate = August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spruce Hall.jpg|thumb|Spruce Hall, CSU's oldest existing building]] Colorado State University's oldest existing building is Spruce Hall, constructed in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, ''Colorado State University Main Campus''. pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a dormitory that played a vital role in the early growth of the school's student enrollment, Spruce now houses the Division of Continuing Education and the Office of Admissions. The newest academic building on campus is the Behavioral Science building, which was completed in summer 2010. Other recent projects include the 2006 Transit Center addition to the north end of Lory Student Center (certified LEED Gold), an expansion of the Student Recreation Center, and the new Computer Science Building, completed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.fm.colostate.edu/projects/index.cfm?page=projects/home |title = Facilities Management Full Projects Listing |accessdate = August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CSU University Center for the Arts.jpg|thumb|left|Colorado State has converted the historic Fort Collins High School building into its University Center for the Arts]] In 2008 CSU also opened its University Center for the Arts, located in the old Fort Collins High School. CSU purchased this historic building in 1995 and has since converted it into a new home for its programs in music, dance, theatre and the visual arts. The three-phase building project included a 318-seat University Theatre, a 100-seat Studio Theatre, and the 24,000 square-foot Runyon Music Hall, an adaptable rehearsal and performance space created out of the old high school gymnasium. The Center also houses the University Art Museum, the Avenir Museum of Design and Merchandising, a 285-seat organ recital hall, and the 200-seat University Dance Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.colostate.edu/features/university-center-for-the-arts.aspx |title = University Center for the Arts Grand Opening |accessdate = August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veterinary hospital===
The James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital complex was constructed in 1979 and consists of four main buildings, the Main Hospital, the Horse and Food Animal Hospital, the Large Animal Isolation Facility, and the Raptor Facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tour.colostate.edu/vet_hosp.html?general-17 |title = Campus Tour Veterinary Teaching Hospital |accessdate = August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Located south of the main campus in Fort Collins, the Main Hospital is a full service hospital divided into small and large animal clinics that annually serve 19,000 small animals and 2,700 large animals from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;According to sources this Veterinary program is one of the most respected in the country.[http://www.tour.colostate.edu/vet_hosp.html Campus Tour, Veterinary Teaching Hospital] Colorado State University Website.

===Pingree Park===
In addition to university property in [[Fort Collins]], large tracts of land for research exist in CSU's name throughout the state of [[Colorado]].

They are run and funded by student fees and team fundraisers and compete with other colleges and universities but not at the NCAA level. There are currently 27 Sport Club&lt;ref name=&quot;campusrec.colostate.edu&quot;&gt;[http://campusrec.colostate.edu/default.cfm?load=SportClubs Colorado State University â Fort Collins]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; teams. Every year the clubs take a combined 150 trips. There are over 1,000 students associated with the program. Last year 23 of these teams competed at regional and national championships. The programs have enjoyed a significant amount of recent success with National Championships in: Men's Ice Hockey (1995)
Women's Lacrosse (2008, 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;campusrec.colostate.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegian.com/index.php/article/2010/06/061610_clubsports |title=Colorado State University â Fort Collins |publisher=Collegian.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;);

====Student media====
The ''Rocky Mountain Collegian'' is CSU's student-run daily newspaper, where students have complete control over editorial decisions. The paper was founded in 1891, and was a weekly publication by the 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the paper earned disrepute in the local community for its unpopular support of women's rights and anti-racism stance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentmedia.colostate.edu/collegianhistory.cfm History of the Collegian]. CSU Student Media Page. Accessed March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1970s, the Collegian was consistently publishing daily. Editorial quality and financial support have varied over the years, at times rising among elite college newspapers and at others struggling to publish. During the 1990s, the paper was twice selected as one of the top 12 daily student papers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentmedia.colostate.edu/collegianhistory.cfm History of the Collegian]. CSU Student Media Page. Accessed March 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2007, the Collegian published a staff article that incited national debate about free speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5708498,00.html Editor's fate in the hands of CSU panel]. Rocky Mountain News. Accessed October 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The article read, in its entirety, &quot;Taser This...Fuck Bush.&quot; This event, as well as president Penley's considerations of &quot;partnering&quot; out the Collegian by Gannett in January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/business/media/18gannett.html?%20_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=rocky+mountain+collegian&amp;st=nyt&amp;oref=slogin Gannett]. NY Times. Accessed October 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; lead to proposals in making CSU's student media, including the Rocky Mountain Collegian, a not-for-profit organization independent from the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.collegian.com/media/storage/paper864/news/2008/05/07/News/Committee.Advises.NonProfit.Status-3366397.shtml Committee Advises NonProfit Status]. The Rocky mountain Collegian. Accessed October 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the entirety of CSU Student Media to separate from the university to operate under an independent company, the Rocky Mountain Student Media Corporation.

KCSU is Colorado State's student run station, with a format focusing on alternative and college rock music, including [[indie rock]], punk, hip-hop and electronic music. News, sports and weather updates along with talk programs and specialty shows round out the programming schedule. Broadcasting at 10,000 [[watt]]s, KCSU is among the larger college stations in the country, reaching approximately 250,000 listeners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcsufm.com/ About KCSU] KCSU Online. Accessed March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
KCSU first began broadcasting in 1964 as a station owned, operated and financed by students. Following a long period as a professional station, KCSU again became student run in 1995, at which time the current format was adopted. As with the Collegian and CTV, KCSU was hit hard by the 1997 flood, and for a time was forced to broadcast from remote locations. Now back in its original Lory Student Center location, KCSU has benefited from revamped production facilities and updated equipment.

CTV is CSU's student-run television station, that allows students to hone their media skills- reporting, writing, producing, shooting, editing- in an educational environment. The station is a winner of fourteen Rocky Mountain Collegiate Media Association awards and a Student Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Heartland Chapter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentmedia.colostate.edu/ctv.cfm CTV Student Media Page]. Accessed March 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Content includes news shows on Tuesdays â Thursdays, a sports show on Mondays, and &quot;The Colorado Music Lounge,&quot; a coproduction with KCSU that profiles local bands performing live, which airs weekly. CTV was founded in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentmedia.colostate.edu/ctvhistory.cfm CTV History]. CSU Student Media Page. Accessed March 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and currently broadcasts weeknights on the university cable station (Comcast channel 11) at 9pm, with reruns at 9am and 12 noon the next day.

Student-run magazine College Avenue was founded in 2005 with the goal, as put forth by its founding editors, of giving students a new forum to address controversial issues affecting the campus community from their own vantage point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collegeave.colostate.edu/archive/Oct05/editor.html Letter from the Editor, Fall 2005 Issue.] Accessed March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its first issue in fall 2005, the magazine has been released quarterly, the most recent issue released in Fall 2011.

====Greek life====
Greek life at Colorado State began in the fall of 1915. Currently 5% of undergraduates join one of CSUs 19 [[fraternities]] and 14 [[sororities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;State University Fact Book 2008. Pg 5&quot;/&gt;  The CSU Inter-Fraternity Council acts as the governing body for the 19 fraternities, each with a delegate representative. Similarly, the CSU Panhellenic Council governs the sororities. CSU Greek organizations are involved in a number of philanthropic activities around campus, among them CSUnity, Cans around the Oval, Habitat for Humanity and RamRide. The governing bodies recently raised $25,000 towards the sponsorship of a [[Habitat for Humanity]] home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csugreeks.colostate.edu/currentstudents.aspx Chapters and Councils, CSU Greek System].

===Residence halls===

13 residence halls provide on campus living for about 5,300 students. 718 apartments for students with families and 190 apartments for older or graduate students are other living options.&lt;ref&gt;''Colorado State University Fact Book, 2007â2008.'' Pg 6&lt;/ref&gt; CSU offers theme floors for people with shared interests. The halls also have a number of Living-Learning communities that directly link the on-campus living environment with a specific academic focus in Honors, engineering, natural sciences, health and wellness, equine sciences, leadership development, or pre-veterinary medicine. The Key Academic and Key Service Communities creates an academically focused residential community for freshmen who share a desire for academic achievement, active involvement in classes, community service, campus activities, and appreciation of diversity. Residents share classes and take advantage of yearlong service opportunities with a close knit group of 19 other students.

CSU Honors Program participants have the opportunity to live in the Honors Living Community. The new Academic Village, which opened in fall 2007, houses Living Learning Communities for 180 Honors and 240 Engineering students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.colostate.edu/index.asp?url=news_item_display&amp;news_item_id=793497430 Colorado State University Will Open New Academic Village This Fall For Engineering, Honors Students] CSU News and Info Online. Accessed March 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Students in the College of Natural Sciences can choose to live in the Ingersoll Residential College.

===Apartment Life===
Students, faculty, and staff may choose to live in the University Apartments. Colorado State University Apartment Life oversees University Village, International House, Lory Apartments, and Aggie Village. Known as a âglobal communityâ Apartment Life's mission to diversity shows in the fact that approximately 60 percent of residents and staff are from 80 different nations. Residents and CSU and Fort Collins community members enjoy a diverse amount of enrichment programs offered through the Apartment Life staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://housing.colostate.edu/apartments/index.htm |title=Housing &amp; Dining Services - Colorado State University |publisher=Housing.colostate.edu |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student demographics===
In fall 2007, CSU opened its doors to 24,983 students, among them 20,765 undergraduates, 2,332 master's students, 1,347 doctoral students, and 539 professional students in the College of Biomedical and Veterinary Medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;State University Fact Book Pg 11&quot;/&gt;  80% of undergraduates are [[Colorado]] residents, and within the student population 50 states and 79 countries are represented. 52% of undergraduates are women, 13.2% of undergraduates are ethnic minorities (excluding international students), and 3% of undergraduates are 30 and over.&lt;ref&gt;''Colorado State University Fact Book, 2007â2008.'' Pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; Of minority students, 48% are [[Hispanic]], 24% [[Asian American]], 16% [[African American]], and 12% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].&lt;ref&gt;''Colorado State University Fact Book, 2007â2008''.

Pg 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Though progress has been made, increasing minority enrollment at CSU has been a challenge for school administrators, one made yet more difficult by high dropout rates in many Colorado high schools with concentrated minority populations.&lt;ref&gt;Sherry, Allison. &quot;More Minorities in State Colleges, But Totals Low.&quot; ''The Denver Post''. 10/12/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major speakers===
