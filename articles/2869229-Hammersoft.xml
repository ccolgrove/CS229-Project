'''Hero''' is the [[anime]] cable [[Channel (communications)|channel]] in the [[Philippines]] formed by Creative Programs Inc. (the cable subsidiary of [[ABS-CBN]]) which also produces [[MYX]], Cinema One, ABS-CBN News Channel, Lifestyle Network, Balls, CgeTV and Velvet. So far, it is seen on [[SkyCable]] in Metro Manila and in over 200 cable systems all over the Philippines. It is also known as '''Hero TV''' by fans and at times by the channel itself probably due to ambiguation purposes.

It is the first and only all-[[Filipino language|Tagalog]]-[[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] anime channel. It aired its first test broadcast from August to September, [[2005]]; regular broadcast started on [[October 2005|the following month]]. It was formally launched at the Philippine Trade Training Center on November 12, 2005

Initially, the channel aired from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight. On April 2006, the schedule was extended to 2:00 a.m. the next day. In January 2011, it became a 24-hour channel.

Some anime shown in the channel were also being shown in a special block in the [[The Filipino Channel]] called ''Hero on TFC''. The said block lasted from 2006â07 and featured some anime already pulled out of the programming rotation at the time.

{{main|List of anime broadcast by Hero}}

Much of the content in Hero is attributed to the fact that Creative Programs Inc's parent company ABS-CBN (through its [[ABS-CBN|main network]]) has produced numerous dubs of anime years before the launch of Hero, as well as maintained an [[ANIMAX]] airing block for quite sometime. Aside from those, the channel also airs anime that have not yet seen in any terrestrial or cable channel shown in the Philippines prior to its first showing in the channel, such as ''[[Mirmo!|Mirmo de Pon!]]''.

The channel also features anime dubbed by Telesuccess, Inc., supplier for most of the anime aired on ABS-CBN's rival [[GMA 7]]. Some of these are ''[[Love Hina]]'', ''[[Rune Soldier]]'', and ''[[Shaman King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/magtibayanime/gma7.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:06:26 List of Philippine anime aired in the Philippines, GMA 7 list]&lt;/ref&gt; Others seen in the channel were previously shown in English on [[Cartoon Network]]'s Philippine feed or, in the case of ''[[Zettai Muteki Raijin-Oh|Raijin-Oh]]'', on government-controlled [[RPN 9]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/magtibayanime/varioustv.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:06:31 List of Philippine anime aired in the Philippines, Various TV channels]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the channel features re-dubs, i.e. it produced its own dubbed version of anime which previously were already dubbed in Tagalog. Examples of these are ''[[Mon Colle Knights]]'', ''[[Metal Fighter Miku]]'', ''[[Zenki]]'', ''[[The Slayers]]'', and ''[[Voltes V]]''.

In 2011, undubbed anime was introduced to the channel with accompanying Filipino-language subtitles in the form of ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light]]'' and [[Initial D#Extra Stage|the ''Initial D Extra Stage'' OVA]]. The reason for airing these two anime features in their original Japanese audio is not known, although it is implied that doing so would satisfy fans who prefer subtitled anime over dubbed ones.

==Non-anime programs==
Although the channel prides itself as an anime channel, some of the programs it aired were non-anime. They are ''[[Mission Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Shadow of the Elves]]'', both produced by the Berliner Film Companie, and the [[tokusatsu]] or live-action shows ''[[Chouseishin Gransazer|The Gransazers]]'', ''[[Kamen Rider Ryuki|Masked Rider Ryuki]]'', and  ''[[Uchuu Keiji Shaider|Shaider]]''.
