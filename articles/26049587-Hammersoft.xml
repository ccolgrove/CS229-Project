'''Hyatt Regency San Francisco''' is a hotel located at the foot of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] and [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|The Embarcadero]] in the [[Financial District (San Francisco)|financial district]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. The hotel is a part of the [[Embarcadero Center]] development by [[Trammell Crow]], [[David Rockefeller]] and [[John Portman]].

The building was sold by its owner, Strategic Hotel Capital LLC,, in January 2007 for close to {{US$|200 million}} to Dune Capital Management and DiNapoli Capital Partners â roughly $250,000 for each of the hotel's 802 rooms.

The ''Regency Club Lounge'' was once the ''Equinox'', a rooftop [[revolving restaurant]], but is now a stationary elite club for certain hotel guests offering 360-degree views of the city and the bay.
== In Popular Culture==
The Hyatt Regency's atrium lobby served as the lobby of the Glass Tower in 1974's ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]''. Replicas of John Portman's trademark pill-shaped elevators were built for use in the film and are featured throughout, including in an extended sequence where one is lifted from the stricken tower by helicopter. The Hotel was also featured in the 1977 Mel Brooks Comedy ''[[High Anxiety]]'', the film ''[[Telefon (film)|Telefon]]'' from 1977 and in ''[[Time After Time (1979 film)]]'', a tale of H.G. Wells chasing Jack The Ripper into the &quot;future&quot; of 1979.

As well as being a setting for numerous films, the lobby is itself inspired by a film. Architect John Portman has stated that its design was suggested to him by viewing the 1935 science fiction film ''[[Things to Come]]''.
