In the long-running [[BBC]] [[science fiction on television|television science fiction]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and related works, the term &quot;'''companion'''&quot; refers to a character who travels with, and shares the adventures of the [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor]]. In most ''Doctor Who'' stories, the primary companion acts as both [[deuteragonist]] and [[audience surrogate]]. He or she (more commonly she) provides the lens through which the viewer is introduced to the series. The companion character, many times, furthers the story by asking questions and getting into trouble, or by helping, rescuing or challenging the Doctor. This designation is applied to a character by the show's producers, and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology. Until the modern revival of the series in 2005, the term was rarely used on-screen. The Doctor also refers to the show's other leads as his &quot;friends&quot; or &quot;assistants&quot;; the British press have also used the latter term. 

==History==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2009}}
When ''Doctor Who'' was created, the dramatic structure of the programme's cast was rather different from the hero-and-sidekick pattern that emerged later. Initially, the character of the Doctor was unclear, with uncertain motives and abilities. The protagonists were schoolteachers [[Ian Chesterton]] and [[Barbara Wright (Doctor Who)|Barbara Wright]], who provided the audience's point-of-view in stories set in Earth's history and on alien worlds. Ian in particular served the role of the action hero. The fourth character was the Doctor's granddaughter [[Susan Foreman|Susan]], who (though initially presented as an &quot;[[An Unearthly Child|unearthly child]]&quot;) was intended{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} as an identification figure for younger viewers.

[[Carole Ann Ford]], who played [[Susan Foreman]], became unhappy with the lack of development for her character,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and chose to leave in its second series. The character of Susan was married off to a freedom fighter and left behind to rebuild a [[Dalek]]-ravaged Earth. ''Doctor Who'''s producers replaced Susan with another young female character, [[Vicki]]. Similarly, when Ian and Barbara left, the &quot;action hero&quot; position was filled by astronaut [[Steven Taylor (Doctor Who)|Steven Taylor]]. This grouping of the Doctor, a young heroic male and an attractive young female became the programme's pattern throughout the 1960s.

When the programme changed to colour in 1970, its format changed: the Doctor was now Earth-bound, and acquired a supporting cast by his affiliation with the paramilitary organisation [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce]] (UNIT). The [[Third Doctor]], more active and physical than his predecessors, made the role of the &quot;action hero&quot; male companion redundant. In the 1970 season the Doctor was assisted by scientist [[Liz Shaw (Doctor Who)|Liz Shaw]] and [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart]], along with other UNIT personnel (such as [[Sergeant Benton]]). The intellectual Shaw was replaced by [[Jo Grant]] in the 1971 season, and as the programme returned to occasional adventures in outer space, the format shifted once more: while UNIT continued to provide a regular &quot;home base&quot; for Earth-bound stories, in stories on other planets the Doctor and Jo became a two-person team with a close, personal bond. This pattern, the Doctor with a single female companion, became a template from which subsequent episodes of ''Doctor Who'' rarely diverged. The &quot;heroic male&quot; type occasionally returned (for example, [[Harry Sullivan]], [[Adric]], [[Vislor Turlough|Turlough]], [[Mickey Smith]], [[Jack Harkness]] and [[Rory Williams]]), but the single female companion was ''Doctor Who'''s staple.

The character of Harry Sullivan was created by the production team when it was expected that the Fourth Doctor would be played by an older actor who would have trouble with the activity expressed by his predecessor. In the event, the Fourth Doctor part went to 40-year-old Tom Baker and the part of Harry, no longer required for the action role, was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;''The Handbook: Fourth Doctor'' p?&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final season for the Fourth Doctor, he acquired three companions (Adric, Tegan and Nyssa) and this situation continued under the Fifth Doctor for a while. Adric was written out by the unusual method within the series of being &quot;killed off&quot;. By the Sixth Doctor, the Doctor was down to a single companion again.

==Definition==
Although the term &quot;companion&quot; is designated to specific characters by the show's producers, and appears in the BBC's promotional material and off-screen fictional terminology, there is no formal definition that constitutes such a designation. Stephen Brook in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's Organgrinder blog discounted Michelle Ryan as a likely next companion but said that &quot;what constitutes a Doctor Who companion is no longer clear&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whois&quot; /&gt; The definition of who is and is not a companion becomes less clear in the newer series.&lt;ref name=&quot;whois&quot; /&gt; During the Doctor's three latest incarnations, his primary companions [[Rose Tyler]], [[Martha Jones]], [[Donna Noble]] and [[Amy Pond]] have fulfilled a distinct dramatic role, more significant than other, less-prominent TARDIS travellers such as Adam, Jack, and Mickey. The British press referred to Martha as the &quot;first ethnic minority companion in the 43-year television history of ''Doctor Who''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,23569-2256654.html | title=Sidekick whose time has come | author=Adam Sherwin |work=The Times |location=UK | date=5 July 2006 | accessdate=1 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;first [[Black people|black]] assistant&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=394073&amp;in_page_id=1773 | title=Doctor Who gets first black assistant | author=Richard Simpson |work=Daily Mail |location=UK | date=5 July 2006 | accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the presence of Mickey Smith in the previous seasonâincluding several episodes in which he travelled in the TARDIS with the Doctor.

The Brigadier was included as a companion in the ''Making of Doctor Who'', published in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Dicks, Terrance and Hulke Malcom, ''The Making of Doctor Who'' Target 0426116151&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening credits do little to clarify the situation. In the first two series of the renewed programme, the only supporting actor to receive a title credit is [[Billie Piper]]. In subsequent series, [[Freema Agyeman]] and [[Catherine Tate]] are credited in all episodes in which they appear. In the third series [[John Barrowman]] receives a title credit for his return to the show. Series Four gave Agyeman, Piper, Barrowman, and [[Elisabeth Sladen]] title billing for each of their reappearances. [[Noel Clarke]] reprised his role in the Series Four finale; although listed as a companion alongside the other actors on the BBC Doctor Who website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BBC Doctor Who Series 4 Characters | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/characters | accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke is not credited in this way. In ''[[The End of Time]]'' [[John Simm]] receives title billing for his antagonist role as the [[Master (Doctor Who)|Master]], ahead of [[Bernard Cribbins]] as companion [[Wilfred Mott]].

Companions in the new series also have a more flexible tenure than their classical predecessors. Several companion characters have returned to the series after leaving the Doctor's company, most notably in the Series Four finale &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot; / &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, which features the return of Rose, Martha, Jack, Sarah Jane and Mickey. This tendency, plus the increase in &quot;one-off&quot; companions like Astrid Peth and Jackson Lake, has further obscured the matter of who is and is not a companion, and when.&lt;ref name=&quot;whois&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Brook |title=Michelle Ryan guest stars in Doctor Who.

The doctor kisses you? I'm no longer sure. Modern TV drama is so difficult.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
{{Ref improve section|date=November 2009}}

Companions have assumed a variety of roles in ''Doctor Who'', as involuntary passengers, as assistants (particularly [[Liz Shaw]]), as friends, and as fellow adventurers.

The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home, or find new causesâor lovesâon worlds they have visited. A few companions (most notably [[Katarina (Doctor Who)|Katarina]], [[Sara Kingdom]] and [[Adric]]) have died during the course of the series.

Most companions travel in the [[TARDIS]] with the Doctor for more than one adventure, although there are exceptions. Sometimes a guest character will take a role in the story similar to that of a companion, such as photographer Isobel Watkins who plays a significant role in ''[[The Invasion (Doctor Who)|The Invasion]]'' in the classic series, or Lynda in &quot;[[Bad Wolf]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Parting of the Ways]]&quot; in the revived series.

Despite the fact that the majority of the Doctor's companions are young, attractive females, the production team for the 1963â1989 series maintained a long-standing taboo against any overt romantic involvement in the TARDIS: for example, [[Peter Davison]], as the [[Fifth Doctor]], was not allowed to put his arm around either [[Sarah Sutton]] ([[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]]) or [[Janet Fielding]] ([[Tegan Jovanka|Tegan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on DVD of ''[[Castrovalva (Doctor Who)|Castrovalva]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, that has not prevented fans from speculating about possible romantic involvements, most notably between the [[Fourth Doctor]] and the Time Lady [[Romana]] (whose actors, [[Tom Baker]] and [[Lalla Ward]], shared a romance and brief marriage). The taboo was controversially{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} broken in the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television movie]] when the [[Eighth Doctor]] was shown kissing companion [[Grace Holloway]]. The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the [[Ninth Doctor]] and [[Rose Tyler]] were a couple, which they vehemently denied. Since the series revival, the Doctor has kissed companions Rose, Jack, Mickey (on the forehead), Martha, Astrid, Donna, Amy, and River Song although each instance was not necessarily in a romantic context (see also [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Romance|&quot;The Doctor and romance&quot;]]). Donna Noble vehemently denied a sexual interest in the Doctor when he invited her to join him and explained &quot;I just want ''a'' mate,&quot; which she misheard as &quot;I just want ''to'' mate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Rose and Martha each developed romantic feelings toward the Doctor who remained platonic toward Martha, but probably fell in love with Rose. This is evidenced in his decision to leave his second self with Rose in a parallel universe in &quot;Journey's End.&quot;  On the opposite side of the same coin, Amy reacted to the stress of her adventures by aggressively trying to seduce the Doctor despite being in love with her fiancÃ© Rory; the Doctor forcibly pushed her off of himself.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Flesh and Stone]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Eleventh Doctor romantically kissed sporadic companion [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] in &quot;[[Day of the Moon]]&quot;, married her in &quot;[[The Wedding of River Song]].&quot;

Previous companions have reappeared in the series, usually for anniversary specials. One former companion, [[Sarah Jane Smith]] (played by [[Elisabeth Sladen]]), together with the robotic dog [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]], appeared in four and two episodes, respectively, of the revived series&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Jane Smith has appeared in &quot;School Reunion&quot;, &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;, &quot;Journey's End&quot;, and &quot;The End of Time&quot;. K-9 has appeared in &quot;School Reunion&quot; and &quot;Journey's End&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; more than twenty years after their last appearances in the 20th anniversary story ''[[The Five Doctors]]'' (1983). The character of Sarah Jane also heads up a [[Doctor Who spin-offs|''Doctor Who'' spin-off]], ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' with K-9. Another companion, [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], is the lead character in the spin-off BBC science fiction programme ''[[Torchwood]]''. Not only have these former companions continued to make appearances on ''Doctor Who'', they have sometimes been accompanied by some of their own companions from the spin-offs when doing so, including Jack's colleagues [[Gwen Cooper]] and [[Ianto Jones]], and Sarah Jane's 'family' [[Mr Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Mr Smith]], [[Luke Smith (The Sarah Jane Adventures)|Luke Smith]] and K-9 Mark IV. Other former companions from both the classic era and revived series have also returned as guest stars in the spin-offs, including Martha Jones on ''Torchwood'', and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Jo Grant on ''The Sarah Jane Adventures''. K-9 Mark I has also been spun off into its own series with an independent continuity.

When ''Doctor Who'' [[History of Doctor Who#The new series|returned to television]] in 2005, the companion characters played a slightly different role, partly due to a strong focus on the character of Rose Tyler and characters connected to her. For example, although [[Adam Mitchell (Doctor Who)|Adam Mitchell]] was a companion by the standard definition, he appeared in only two episodes and was arguably a less significant part of the 2005 series than Rose's sometime boyfriend [[Mickey Smith]], who was not technically a companion but appeared in five episodes (or six, including a brief appearance as a child in &quot;[[Father's Day]]&quot;). Mickey later gained full-fledged companion status when he travelled in the TARDIS in the 2006 episode &quot;[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]&quot;. In that episode, Sarah Jane Smith referred to Rose as the Doctor's &quot;assistant&quot;, a term to which the latter took offence. This exchange might be regarded as indicating the new series' shift in approach to the companion role.

As of the end of the fifth series, [[Sarah Jane Smith]] is the only classic era companion to have been asked to travel again by the Doctor in the revived series. She declined his invitation in &quot;[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]&quot;, but subsequently met up with the Doctor aboard a Dalek ship in &quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot; and travelled with him, several other companions, and Rose's mother [[Jackie Tyler]] in the TARDIS as they towed the Earth back to the solar system. Sarah Jane, [[Jo Grant|Jo Jones (nÃ¨e Grant)]], and their own respective companions also momentarily travelled in the TARDIS with the Eleventh Doctor in ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' serial, ''[[Death of the Doctor]]''.

==Death of a companion==
During the course of the show's history, there have been rare occasions when companions have died while on adventures with the Doctor.

*Two companions are killed in the ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]''. [[Katarina (Doctor Who)|Katarina]], who had been introduced at the end of the preceding story, was deemed by the production team to be an unsuitable character as a long-term companion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/v.html|title=A Brief History Of Time (Travel): The Daleks' Master Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Katarina is killed when she opens the [[airlock]] of a spaceship. [[Sara Kingdom]], who takes over Katarina's companion role for the remainder of the story, is also killed when she undergoes extreme aging as a side-effect of the [[First Doctor]]'s activation of a &quot;Time Destructor&quot; device.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctor Who: Companions'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Adric]] dies at the end of Episode 4 of ''[[Earthshock]]'' in the explosion of a bomb-laden space freighter in Earth's atmosphere.
*[[Kamelion]], an android companion, is destroyed by the Fifth Doctor in Episode 4 of ''[[Planet of Fire]]'' as an act of mercy after Kamelion is taken over by the Master.
*[[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9 Mark III]] sacrifices himself in &quot;[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]&quot; in order to save the Doctor and his friends from a group of aliens. The subsequent K-9 Mark IV that the Doctor leaves with Sarah Jane tells her that the Mark III's files have been transferred to the new machine.
*[[Astrid Peth]] sacrifices herself in order to kill [[List of Doctor Who villains#Max Capricorn|Max Capricorn]] by driving him into a reactor core at the end of &quot;[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]&quot;. The Tenth Doctor partially resurrects her and sends her atoms flying into space.
*At the end of &quot;[[The Waters of Mars (Doctor Who)|The Waters of Mars]]&quot;, Adelaide Brooke kills herself to preserve a fixed point in time.
*In &quot;[[The Wedding of River Song]]&quot;, the Doctor telephones Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart's nursing home to have him made ready to travel, and is informed of his peaceful death some months earlier (paralleling the real-world death of actor [[Nicholas Courtney]]).
*[[River Song]] sacrifices herself in [[Forest of the Dead]] to save the Doctor's life, but he is able to upload a digital copy of her consciousness to the data core. 

===Mitigated===
*In ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', [[Peri Brown]] is killed by King Yrcanos in ''[[Mindwarp]]'', after her brain has been replaced by that of Kiv, a member of the [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Mentor|Mentor]] race. However, in ''[[The Ultimate Foe]]'' it is revealed that Peri had not been killed and had instead become Yrcanos' consort.
*[[Grace Holloway]] is killed by [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] but revived by the TARDIS' link to the [[Eye of Harmony]] during the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television movie]].
*[[Jack Harkness]] is killed by Daleks but is brought back to life and given immortality by [[Rose Tyler]] in &quot;[[The Parting of the Ways]]&quot;.
*The alternative timeline from &quot;[[Turn Left (Doctor Who)|Turn Left]]&quot; sees the off-screen deaths of [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and [[Martha Jones]], but these events are undone by [[Donna Noble]]'s own self-sacrifice at the episode's climax.
*[[Rory Williams]] is killed by the Eknodine in one of the dream worlds of &quot;[[Amy's Choice (Doctor Who)|Amy's Choice]]&quot;. Realising it is her only chance of seeing Rory again, [[Amy Pond]] subsequently kills both herself and the Doctor in the same reality.
*Rory is also killed by the [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurian]] Restac at the conclusion of &quot;[[Cold Blood (Doctor Who)|Cold Blood]]&quot;, sacrificing himself to protect the Doctor. He is subsequently consumed by a [[Story arcs in Doctor Who#Cracks in the universe|crack in time]], wiping him from existence. He reappears in &quot;[[The Pandorica Opens]]&quot; as an [[Auton]] duplicate, created from [[Amy Pond]]'s memories, and is restored to his old life along with the rest of the universe in &quot;[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]&quot;.
*[[Amy Pond]] is killed by the Auton Rory in &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;, but is restored by the Pandorica in &quot;The Big Bang&quot;.
*Near the end of &quot;[[The Girl Who Waited]]&quot; an older Amy Pond, who existed in an alternative time line to Rory and the Doctor, sacrificed herself so her younger counterpart could regain the time with Rory she lost.
