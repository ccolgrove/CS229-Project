'''Aleksandar &quot;Sasha&quot; VujaÄiÄ''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|ÐÐ»ÐµÐºÑÐ°Ð½Ð´Ð°Ñ Â»Ð¡Ð°ÑÐ°Â« ÐÑÑÐ°ÑÐ¸Ñ}}, [[Slovenian language|Slovene]]: SaÅ¡a VujaÄiÄ, rendered in English as ''Sasha Vujacic''; born March 8, 1984) is a [[Slovenes|Slovenian]] basketball player who has played in Italy, the United States (for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]), and more recently for [[Anadolu Efes S.K.]] in [[Turkey]]. Though he has played the [[point guard]] position in Europe, he found more playing time at the [[shooting guard]] spot while in the Lakers' [[triangle offense]]. 

== Early career ==
His father Vaso VujaÄiÄ is a [[Serbs|Serbian]] basketball coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;siembassy&quot;&gt;[http://washington.embassy.si/fileadmin/user_upload/dkp_51_vwa/newsletter/Newsletter_2007-01-10.pdf Prominent Slovenian Athletes in the United States] by Embassy of the Republic of Slovenia, January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; VujaÄiÄ was a member of the Slovenian junior national team. He won a silver medal at the 2002 European Junior Championship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/sasha_vujacic/bio.html &quot;NBA Bio&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

VujaÄiÄ began his professional career at the age of 16, playing with [[Snaidero Udine]] of [[Italy]]. The same year, he was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the 27th overall pick in the [[2004 NBA Draft]].

== Career highlights ==
During the 2005â06 season VujaÄiÄ made the go-ahead three-pointer in overtime to give the Lakers the lead for good in a win against the [[Utah Jazz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Los Angeles Lakers/Utah Jazz recap December 1, 2005 Thursday recap| publisher=AP Sports| url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap?gid=2005120126| date=2005-12-01| accessdate = 2007-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[2006â07 NBA season|2006â07 season]] he made a shot against the [[Dallas Mavericks]] to end their 13-game winning streak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Vujacic, Lakers put end to Mavs' impressive streak| publisher=CBS Sportsline.com wire reports| url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/nba/gamecenter/recap/NBA_20070107_DAL@LAL| date=2007-01-08| accessdate = 2007-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 2007â08 season, VujaÄiÄ recorded a then-career high 22 points in a win over the Denver Nuggets, and he tied it in a win over the Toronto Raptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kobe watches 4th quarter from bench as Vujacic, Lakers bounce Nuggets| publisher=ESPN| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=271129013|accessdate=2007-11-30|date=2007-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; VujaÄiÄ shot 60% from beyond the three-point line in the [[2006 NBA Playoffs]].

In the 2007-2008 season Vujacic made 118 of his 270 three-point field goal attempts, setting the Los Angeles Lakers single-season record for the best three-point field goal percentage (.437) in a single season. 

During Game 3 of the [[2008 NBA Finals]], VujaÄiÄ scored a career playoff high, totaling 20 points off the bench. VujaÄiÄ's 20, with the exception of [[Kobe Bryant]], made him the only Laker to score in double figures.

In July 2008 he switched [[agent (sports)|agents]] to [[Rob Pelinka]]. Later that month (July 25) VujaÄiÄ and the Lakers agreed to a three-year deal worth 15&amp;nbsp;million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/fantasy/fantasy_playernews.jsp?date=07/19/2008&amp;type=news|title=Fantasy/Player News|accessdate=2008-07-23|date=2008-07-18|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC.|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Game 6 of the [[2010 NBA Finals]], VujaÄiÄ led the Lakers' bench with nine points, including two three-pointers. With 11 seconds left in Game 7 and the Lakers leading by only two points, VujaÄiÄ helped secure the Lakers' championship with two crucial free throws.

On December 15, 2010, VujaÄiÄ was traded to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in a three-team trade involving the Lakers and [[Houston Rockets]]. On the Nets, VujaÄiÄ reunited with former Lakers teammate [[Jordan Farmar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NETS Acquire Vujacic &amp; Two 1st-Round Picks in 3-Team Trade | url = http://www.nba.com/nets/news/Vujacic_Trade_Release_101215.html | work = [[NBA.com]] | date = 2010-12-15 | accessdate = 2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of [[Ben Uzoh]] wearing the number 18 jersey, VujaÄiÄ changed his number to 20.

In his debut for the Nets, VujaÄiÄ had 6 points, 2 rebounds and 2 assists in 27 minutes of play.

On January 1, 2011, VujaÄiÄ tied his career high of 22 points, eight games after being traded to the Nets.

On February 9, 2011, VujaÄiÄ set a new career high with 25 points in a win over the Hornets.

In July 2011 he signed a one-year deal and an option for another with [[Anadolu Efes S.K.]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euroleague.net/euroleaguenews/transactions/2011-12-signings/i/86715/5611/anadolu-efes-signs-vujacic ANADOLU EFES signs Vujacic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efesbasket.org/Haberler/A-Takim/sasha-vujacic-efeste.aspx Sasha Vujacic Efes'te... ] {{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
