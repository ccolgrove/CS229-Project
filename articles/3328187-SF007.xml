<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="3328187" ns="0" title="Tintin books, films, and media"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">This is a '''list of all books, films and media produced so far in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'''''.

== Books ==
The books can either be listed in the order in which the stories first appeared in newspapers or magazines (the &quot;production order&quot;), or in the order they were first published in album form (&quot;publication order&quot;). As many early stories were altered in the redrawings, and therefore chronologically fit in more with the later albums, both orders can be considered valid. Sometimes the redrawings introduced problems with the chronological order, one example is when Sheik Patrash Pasha presents a copy of ''Destination Moon'' in ''Cigars of the Pharaoh'' &amp;mdash; ''Destination Moon'' was published almost 20 years after ''Cigars of the Pharaoh''.

== Other books ==
{{For|a detailed list of unofficial works|List of Tintin parodies and pastiches}}
{{For|a list of books that discuss the series and its author|List of books about Tintin}}

* In 1983, [[Benoit Peeters]] published ''Le monde d'HergÃ©'' (later translated in [[English language|English]] as ''[[Tintin and the World of HergÃ©]]''), which chronicles the illustrated history of [[Belgium|Belgian]] writer-artist Georges Remi (better known as [[HergÃ©]]), and his creation ''Tintin''.
* In 1993, after the death of HergÃ©, his friend [[Frederic Tuten]] published ''Tintin in the New World: A Romance'' (ISBN 0-7493-9610-5). More a [[thought experiment]] than a new adventure, Tintin here grows up: he is seduced and falls in love, has a dream about the death of Snowy and caring for an invalid Haddock, and critically examines his life and experiences.
* In 1980, a pirate comic/parody, ''[[The Adventures of Tintin: Breaking Free]]'', was released, featuring Tintin as an unemployed youngster living with his uncle-by-marriage Haddock, who gets involved with the [[socialist]]/[[anarchists]].
* In December 1999, a pirate comic book ''[[Tintin in Thailand]]'' came into circulation. The book, illustrated by Thai artists{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, presented Tintin, Haddock and Calculus on a sex holiday to [[Bangkok]], with numerous allusions to the characters being unhappy with their treatment by the HergÃ© Foundation. In 2001, Belgian police made several arrests regarding the book in the Belgian town of [[Tournai]].
* ''[[The Adventures of Tintin at Sea]]'' by Michael Farr (2004) ISBN 0-7195-6119-1 - a guide to the nautical-related scenes in canonical Tintin books
