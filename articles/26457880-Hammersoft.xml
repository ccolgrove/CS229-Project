'''Air India''' ({{lang-hi|à¤à¤à¤° à¤à¤à¤¡à¤¿à¤¯à¤¾}}) is the [[flag carrier]] [[airline]] of India.  It is part of the [[government of India]] owned [[Air India Limited]] (AIL).  The airline operates a fleet of [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] aircraft serving Asia, Australia, Europe and North America.  Its corporate office is located at the ''Air India Building'' at [[Nariman Point]] in [[South Mumbai]].  Air India has two major domestic hubs at [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] and [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]].  An international hub at [[Dubai International Airport]] is currently being planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-air-india-plans-major-hub-in-dubai/20110425.htm Air India plans major hub in Dubai]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
{{main|Tata Airlines}}
Air India was founded by [[J. R. D. Tata]] in July 1932 as [[Tata Airlines]], a division of Tata Sons Ltd. (now [[Tata Group]]). On 15 October 1932, J. R. D. Tata flew a single-engined [[De Havilland Puss Moth]] carrying air mail (postal mail of [[Imperial Airways]]) from [[Karachi]]'s Drigh Road Aerodrome to [[Bombay]]'s [[Juhu aerodrome|Juhu Airstrip]] via [[Ahmedabad]]. The aircraft continued to [[Madras]] via [[Bellary]] piloted by former [[Royal Air Force]] pilot [[Nevill Vintcent]]. In 1932 Air India was based out of a hut with a palm thatched roof at Juhu Aerodrome and had 1 pilot and 2 apprentice mechanics along with 2 piston engined aircraft, one [[de Havilland Puss Moth|Puss Moth]] and one [[de Havilland Leopard Moth|Leopard Moth]] aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn8120724828&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Pran Nath Seth, Pran Nath Seth, Sushma Seth Bhat | title=An introduction to travel and tourism | publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

===Post-war expansion===
Following the end of [[World War II]], regular commercial service was restored in India and Tata Airlines became a public limited company on 29 July 1946 under the name Air India. In 1948, after the [[independence of India]], 49% of the airline was acquired by the [[Government of India]], with an option to purchase an additional 2%. In return, the airline was granted status to operate international services from India as the designated flag carrier under the name ''Air India International''. On 8 June 1948, a [[Lockheed Constellation]] L-749A named ''Malabar Princess'' (registered VT-CQP) took off from Bombay bound for London via [[Cairo]] and [[Geneva]]. This marked the airline's first long-haul international flight, soon followed by service in 1950 to [[Nairobi]] via [[Aden]].

On 25 August 1953, the Government of India exercised its option to purchase a majority stake in the carrier and Air India International Limited was born as one of the fruits of the Air Corporations Act that nationalised the air transportation industry. At the same time all domestic services were transferred to [[Indian Airlines]] (now renamed as ''Indian''). In 1954, the airline took delivery of its first L-1049 [[Lockheed Constellation|Super Constellations]] and inaugurated services to [[Bangkok]], Hong Kong, Tokyo and [[Singapore]].

===The jet age===
Air India International entered the [[jet age]] in 1960 when its first [[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-420]], named ''Gauri Shankar'' (registered VT-DJJ), was delivered. Jet services to New York City via London were inaugurated that same year on 14 May 1960. On 8 June 1962, the airline's name was officially truncated to Air India. On 11 June 1962, Air India became the world's first all-jet airline.

In 1971, the airline took delivery of its first [[Boeing 747-200B]] named ''Emperor Ashoka'' (registered VT-EBD). This coincided with the introduction of the 'Palace In The Sky' livery and branding. A feature of this livery is the paintwork around each aircraft window, in the cusped arch style of windows in Indian palaces. In 1986 Air India took delivery of the [[Airbus A310|Airbus A310-300]]; the airline is the largest operator of this type in passenger service. In 1988, Air India took delivery of two [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]]Ms in mixed passenger-cargo configuration.

===Early 1990s===
In 1993, Air India took delivery of the flagship of its fleet when the first [[Boeing 747-400]] named ''Konark'' (registered VT-ESM) made history by operating the first non-stop flight between New York City and [[Delhi]]. In 1994 the airline was registered as Air India Ltd. In 1996, the airline inaugurated service to its second US gateway at [[O'Hare International Airport]] in Chicago. In 1999, the airline opened its dedicated Terminal 2-C at the renamed [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] in [[Mumbai]].

===2000 â present===
In 2000, Air India introduced services to Shanghai and to its third US gateway at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. In May 2004, Air India launched a wholly owned [[low cost airline]] called [[Air-India Express]]. Air India Express connecting cities in India with the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Subcontinent. In 2004 Air India launched flights to its fourth US gateway at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in Los Angeles (which has since been terminated) and expanded its international routes to include flights from [[Ahmedabad]], [[Amritsar]], [[Bangalore]] and [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].

On 1 December 2009, Air India introduced services to its fifth US gateway at [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], accessed via a stopover at [[JFK Airport]] in New York City. This service has been terminated.

;Re-privatisation plans
In 2001, Air India was put up for sale by the then [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1185716.stm | work=BBC News | title=Air India privatisation finds three suitors | date=23 February 2001 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the bids was by a consortium of [[Tata Group]]-[[Singapore Airlines]]. However the re-privatisation plans were shelved after Singapore Airlines pulled out and the global economy slumped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1523153.stm | work=BBC News | title=India privatisation plans near 'collapse' | date=3 September 2001 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Merger with Indian Airlines
In 2007, the Government of India announced that Air India would be merged with [[Indian Airlines]]. As part of the merger process, a new company called the [[National Aviation Company of India Limited]] (NACIL) was established, into which both Air India (along with [[Air India Express]]) and [[Indian Airlines]] (along with [[Alliance Air]]) will be merged.

On 27 February 2011, Air India and Indian Airlines merged along with their subsidiaries to form Air India Limited.

;Financial crisis
Around 2006â2007, the airlines began showing signs of financial distress. The combined losses for Air India and Indian in 2006-07 were {{nowrap|[[File:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|8px|link=Indian rupee sign]]}} 770 [[crores]] ({{nowrap|[[File:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|8px|link=Indian rupee sign]]}} 7.7 billion). After the merger of the airlines, this went up to {{nowrap|[[File:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|8px|link=Indian rupee sign]]}} 7,200 crores ({{nowrap|[[File:Indian Rupee symbol.svg|8px|link=Indian rupee sign]]}} 72 billion) by March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=16 Jul 2009, 06.10AM IST, Manju V,TNN |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/What-sent-Air-India-crashing/articleshow/4782707.cms |title=What sent Air India crashing? |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by restructuring plans which are still in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/07/09/stories/2009070960801200.htm |title=Air India restructuring plans being readied |publisher=Hindu.com |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2010-08-30 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, [[State Bank of India|SBI Capital Markets Ltd]] was appointed to prepare a road map for the recovery of the airline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report_sbi-caps-prepares-roadmap-for-air-india-restructuring_1276407 |title=SBI Caps prepares roadmap for Air India restructuring |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=2009-07-22 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier sold three [[Airbus A300]] and one [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-300]]M in March 2009 for $18.75 million to survive the financial crunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/AI-sells-4-aircraft-in-Mar-to-tackle-financial-crunch/495189/ |title=AI sells 4 aircraft in Mar to tackle financial crunch |publisher=Financialexpress.com |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2011, Air India has accumulated a debt of Rs. 42,570 crore (approximately $10 billion) and an operating loss of Rs. 22,000 crore, and is seeking  Rs. 42,920 crore from the government.&lt;ref  name = &quot;ref1&quot;&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/2011/08/09002707/Air-India8217s-recurring-de.html  Air Indiaâs recurring default âcredit negativeâ for its banks] Mint-Wall Street Journal,  9 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; For the past three months (June, July, August 2011), the carrier has been missing salary payments and interest payments and Moodyâs Investor Service has warned that missing payments by Air India to creditors, such as the State Bank of India, will negatively affect the credit ratings of those banks.&lt;ref name =&quot;ref1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/State-Bank-of-India-credit-rating-718330 State Bank of India Credit Rating - Moody's&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) blamed the decision to buy 111 new planes as one of the major causes of the debt troubles in Air India; in addition it blamed on the ill timed merger with Indian Airlines as well,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/contentView.do?contentId=10024257&amp;programId=1073750974&amp;tabId=0&amp;contentType=EDITORIAL&amp;BV_ID=@@@  Air India aircraft acquisition was necessary: Patel], Malayala Manorama, 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904836104576558101182208210.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Santanu | last=Choudhury | title=Auditor Slams Air India Plane Orders | date=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air India's corporate headquarters is located at the ''Air India Building'' at [[Nariman Point]] in [[South Mumbai]]. The airline moved there in 1970. The ''Air India Building'' also serves as a regional office for [[Indian (airline)|Indian]].

;Delhi Hub
On 1 March 2009, Air India had made [[Frankfurt Airport]] at [[Frankfurt am Main]] as its international hub for onward connections to United States from India; however, the airline shut down the Frankfurt hub on 30 October 2010. However on 14 July 2010, Air India chief, Arvind Jadhav announced their intention to make the new terminal 3 at Delhi's  [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] the hub for international and domestic operations with the plans of starting new direct flights to Chicago and Toronto and also taking almost all international long haul flights away from its former Primary hub at [[Mumbai]]'s [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] due to lack of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.profit.ndtv.com/news/show/air-india-to-use-terminal-3-as-hub-of-operations-82429 |title=Air India to use Terminal-3 as hub of operations - NDTV Profit |publisher=Beta.profit.ndtv.com |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would also provide greater convenience for transit passengers who before had to transfer between the international and domestic terminals which were located on completely different sides of the airport. They will now be able to catch their connecting flights within the same terminal.

;Return to profitability plans
The new Chairman and Managing director wants to change the order of some of the 111 planes ordered in 2006 to get narrow-body aircraft instead of the wide-body aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessworld1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessworld.in/bw/2010_05_08_All_The_Kings_Men.html?storyInSinglePage=true |title=All The Kingâs Men |publisher=Businessworld.in |date=2010-05-08 |accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate affairs and identity==
[[File:Air-India-building.jpg|thumb|the Air India Building, [[Nariman Point]], [[Mumbai]]]]
;Organization
{{See also|Air India Limited}}
Air India has three subsidiaries. Together Air India, [[Air India Cargo]], Air India Express and [[Air India Regional]] form the Air India Limited.

===Subsidiaries===
;Air India Cargo
[[File:Air India Airbus A310-304 VT-EQS.jpg|thumb|Air India Cargo Airbus A310-300F.]]
{{Main|Air India Cargo}}
In 1954, Air India Cargo started its freighter operations with a Douglas DC-3 Dakota aircraft, giving Air India the distinction of being the first Asian airline to operate freighters. The airline operates cargo flights to many destinations. The airline also has ground truck-transportation arrangements on select destinations.

A member of IATA, Air India carries all types of cargo including dangerous goods (hazardous materials) and live animals, provided such shipments are tendered according to ''IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations'' and ''IATA Live Animals Regulations''.

At the warehouse in Mumbai, Air India has developed a system of inventory management for cargo handling of import/export functions. This takes care of the entire management of cargo, supports ''Electronic Data Interface'' (EDI) messages with Indian Customs and replaces to a great extent existing paper correspondence between Customs, Airlines, and the custodians. This also replaces manual handling and binning of cargo at the warehouse in Mumbai by Air India.

;Air India Express
{{Main|Air India Express}}
Air India Express is the airline's [[low-cost airline|low-cost]] subsidiary which was established in 2005 during the aviation boom in India. It operates scheduled passenger services primarily to the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[South East Asia]]. Air India Express is currently the only airline in Air India Limited which posts profits. It operates a fleet of Next Generation [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]] aircraft.[[Cochin International Airport]] is the main hub of the airline from which it has connections to almost all the Gulf countries.

;Air India Regional
{{Main|Air India Regional}}
Air India Regional (formerly known as Alliance Air) serves mainly on regional routes. Its main hub is Delhi's [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]].

===Livery===
[[File:Air India 1.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 747-400]] in 1970â2007 ''Palace In The Sky'' livery]]
[[File:Air India 777-300ER VT-ALL.jpg|thumb|The present Air India Livery on the Boeing 777-300ER]]
[[File:Air India 001.jpg|thumb|Air India One]]
;1970â2007 livery
Air India's livery was mostly painted in red and white colours. The bottoms of the aircraft remain metal and unpainted but the upper portion is given a white background along with the airline's name written in red. The name is in Hindi on one side and in English on the other. The painted on red palace style carvings on the outside of the windows refer to their slogan &quot;your palace in the sky&quot; which is written on the back of the aircraft. Near the noses of Air India aircraft, the air plane is given a name. Most planes are named after powerful Indian kings or landmarks. Finally, the tail is mostly red with again, the carrier's name written in Hindi on one side and English on the other.

In 1989, to supplement its &quot;Flying Palace&quot; livery, Air India introduced a new livery that was mostly white with a golden spinning wheel (as seen on the flag of India) on a red tail. Only applied to around a half of Air India's fleet, the new livery did not succeed, as the Indian flying public complained about the phasing out of the classic colours. The livery was dropped after two years and the old scheme was returned.

;Pre-merger livery
On 15 May 2007, Air India refreshed its livery, making the Rajasthani arches along the windows slightly smaller, extending a stylised cheatline from the vertical tail of the aircraft to the nose, and painting a small portion of the underbelly red. Additionally, engine nacelles are now deep red, and a gold-coloured version of the airline's stylized Konark trademark now adorns both the vertical tail and engine nacelles.

;Post-merger livery
On 22 May 2007, Air India and [[Indian (airline)|Indian]] unveiled their new livery. The logo of the new airline is a Flying Swan with the Konark Chakra placed inside it. The Flying Swan has been morphed from Air Indiaâs characteristic logo, âThe Centaurâ whereas the âKonark Chakraâ is reminiscent of Indianâs logo.

The new logo features prominently on the tail of the aircraft. Individually the Konark Chakra also features on all the engines of the aircraft. The choice of colours namely red for âFlying Swanâ and orange for âKonark Chakraâ are meant to signify vigour and advancement. Further the colours also have a strong association with two carriers thereby retaining the earlier imagery of traditional hospitality and service.

While the aircraft is ivory in colour, the base retains the red streak of Air India. Running parallel to each other is the Orange and Red speed lines from front door to the rear door, subtly signifying the individual identities merged into one. The brand name âAir Indiaâ runs across the tail of the aircraft in [[hindi]].

==Destinations==
{{Main|Air India destinations}}
Air India serves 49 domestic destinations and 26 international destinations in 19 countries across Asia, Europe and North America.

;Short-haul routes
Air India's short-haul routes mainly include domestic cities and cities in [[South East Asia]] and [[South West Asia]]. For short-haul routes its [[Airbus A310]], [[Airbus A330]], Boeing 747-400 and [[Boeing 777#777-200LR|Boeing 777-200LR]] are used apart from [[Airbus A320 family]] aircraft of [[Indian (airline)|Indian]] which are operated with Air India callsign and code.

;Long-haul routes
The airline has long-haul destinations in [[East Asia]], Europe and North America which are served using [[Boeing 777#777-200LR|Boeing 777-200LR]] and [[Boeing 777|-300ER]] aircraft.
