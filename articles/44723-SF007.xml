{{History of printing}}
'''Printing''' is a process for reproducing text and image, typically with ink on [[paper]] using a printing press. It is often carried out as a large-scale industrial process, and is an essential part of publishing and transaction printing.

The development of printing was preceded by the use of [[cylinder seal]]s in [[Mesopotamia]] developed in 3500 BC, and other related [[stamp seal]]s. The earliest form of printing was [[woodblock printing]], with existing examples from [[China]] dating to before 220 AD&lt;ref name=&quot;cave&quot;&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), &quot;Caves of the Thousand Buddhas&quot;, 1990, British Museum publications, ISBN 0714114472&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Egypt]] to the 4th century. Later developments in printing include the [[movable type]], first developed by [[Bi Sheng]] in China,&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Chinese Inventions&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota-china.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[printing press]], a more efficient printing process developed by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Fran.

==History==
{{Main|History of printing}}

===Woodblock printing===
[[Woodblock printing]] is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout [[East Asia]]. It originated in [[China]] in antiquity as a method of printing on [[textile]]s and later on [[paper]]. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 AD, and from [[Roman Egypt]] to the 4th century.

===In East Asia===

[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The intricate frontispiece of the [[Diamond Sutra]] from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, 868 AD ([[British Museum]])]]
{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China and are of silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before 220 AD), and the earliest example of woodblock printing on paper appeared in the mid-7th century in China.

By the 9th century printing on paper had taken off, with the first extant complete printed book, the [[Diamond Sutra]] in 868, and by the 10th century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed and the Confucian classics. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;

Printing spread early to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] who also used Chinese [[logogram]]s but the techniques were also used in [[Turpan]] and [[Vietnam]] using a number of other scripts. However, unlike the diffusion of [[paper]], printing techniques never spread to the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Thomas|title=The Invention of Printing in China|pages=102â111|year=1925}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Middle East===

Woodblock printing on cloth appeared in [[Roman Egypt]] by the 4th century. Block printing, called ''tarsh'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was developed in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]] during the 9th-10th centuries, mostly for prayers and [[amulet]]s. There is some evidence to suggest that the print blocks were made from non-wood materials, possibly [[tin]], lead, or clay. However, the techniques employed are uncertain and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the [[Muslim world]]. Though Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Muslim world, initially for fabric, the technique of metal block printing remained unknown in Europe. Block printing later went out of use in Islamic [[Central Asia]] after movable type printing was introduced from China.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), &quot;[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]&quot;. ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), p. 427-438.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe===

[[File:BuxheimStChristopher.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Woodcut print dated 1423 of St Christopher from Buxheim on the Upper Rhine]]
Block printing first came to Christian Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate, and when [[paper]] became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing card]]s printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] were produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onwards.&lt;!-- This may be supported by the reference - An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind,p , Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 ISBN 0-486-20952-0 (recovered from a previous version of this article) --&gt;

Around the mid-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common.  There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of [[movable type]], with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440 and 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movable-type printing===

{{Main|Movable type}}
{{See also|History of Western typography}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of printing and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]]. [[Movable type]] allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.

Around 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by [[Bi Sheng]] out of [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Great Chinese Inventions&quot;/&gt; Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] later carved a more durable type from wood by 1298 CE, and developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. However, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing.

Copper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of 12th century.  It was used in large scale printing of paper money
issued by the Northern Song dynasty. 

[[File:Korean moveable typeset form 1447.jpg|thumb|left|Korean moveable metal typeset form, used to print ''ìë³´ìì '' (Seokbosangjeol&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hangeulmuseum.org/sub/eng_new/record/seokbo.jsp Seokbosangjeol&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1447.]]
But around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing. The [[Jikji]], published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould and bronze poured into the mould and the type was finally polished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around [[1450]], [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced what is regarded as an invention of movable type in Europe (see [[printing press]]), along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of [[lead]], [[tin]] and [[antimony]] â the same components still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Britannica. Retrieved November 27, 2006, from [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] â entry 'printing'&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Metal movable type.jpg|right|thumb|A case of cast metal type pieces and typeset matter in a composing stick.]]

===The printing press===
Johannes Gutenberg's work on the [[printing press]] began in approximately [[1436]] when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehen â a man he had previously instructed in gem-cutting â and Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name=&quot;meggs58-69&quot;&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 58â69)&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until a [[1439]] [[lawsuit]] against Gutenberg that official record exists; witnesses testimony discussed type, an inventory of metals (including lead) and his type mold.&lt;ref name=&quot;meggs58-69&quot;/&gt;

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page setting and printing using a press was faster and more durable. The metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to typography and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type, and [[printing press]]es rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[Spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. Today, practically all movable type printing ultimately derives from Gutenberg's movable type printing, which is often regarded as the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[TimeâLife]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg &quot;Man of the Millennium&quot;.

===Rotary printing press===
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
The '''rotary printing press''' was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843. It uses impressions curved around a cylinder to print on long continuous rolls of [[paper]] or other substrates. Rotary drum printing was later significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]].

==Modern printing technology==
[[File:Drukarnia-zlamywak.jpg|right|thumb|The [[folding machine|folder]] of newspaper web offset printing press.]]
Across the world, over 45 trillion pages (2005 figure) are printed annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;vj_ipg2-0_keynote&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html When 2% Leads to a Major Industry Shift]&quot; Patrick Scaglia, August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 there were approximately 30,700 printing companies in the United States, accounting for $112 billion, according to the ''2006 U.S. Industry &amp; Market Outlook'' by [http://www.barnesreports.com Barnes Reports]. Print jobs that move through the Internet made up 12.5% of the total U.S. printing market last year, according to research firm InfoTrend/CAP Ventures.

===Offset press===
{{Main|Offset press}}
'''Offset printing''' is a widely used printing technique where the inked image is transferred (or &quot;offset&quot;) from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.

Currently, most [[book]]s and [[newspaper]]s are printed using the technique of offset lithography. Other common techniques include:
*[[flexography]] used for packaging, labels, newspapers.
*hot wax [[dye transfer]]
*[[inkjet]] used typically to  print a small number of books or packaging, and also to print a variety of materials from high quality papers simulate offset printing, to floor tiles; Inkjet is also used to apply mailing addresses to direct mail pieces.
*[[laser printing]] mainly used in offices and for transactional printing (bills, bank documents). Laser printing is commonly used by direct mail companies to create variable data letters or coupons, for example.
*[[pad printing]] popular for its unique ability to print on complex 3-dimensional surfaces.
*[[relief print]], (mainly used for [[Mail-order catalog|catalogue]]s).
*[[rotogravure]] mainly used for magazines and packaging.
*[[screen-printing]] from T-shirts to floor tiles.

===Gravure===
[[Rotogravure|Gravure printing]] is an [[intaglio printing]] technique, where the image to be printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade, then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing plates are usually made from copper and may be produced by digital engraving or [[laser]] etching.

Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging, and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.

==Impact of the invention of printing==
===Religious impact===
[[Samuel Hartlib]], who was exiled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that &quot;the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppression&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs-Burke&quot;&gt;Ref: Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15-23, 61-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Both churchmen and governments were concerned that print allowed readers, eventually including those from all classes of society, to study religious texts and politically sensitive issues by themselves, instead of having their thinking mediated by the religious and political authorities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
[[Image:PrintMus 038.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the Gutenberg press at the [[International Printing Museum]] in Carson, CA.]]

It took a somewhat longer time for print to penetrate [[Russia]] while it appeared a little earlier in the rest of [[Orthodox Christian]] world, a region (including modern [[Serbia]], [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]]). First book printed by Serbs appeared in 1493, but Serbian printing, as well as that of other Balkan states, was largely extinguished by the arrival of Ottoman oppressors. Serbian and Greek books were also printed in printing houses run by Serbs and Greeks in Venice, and later Austria-Hungary. 

In the [[Muslim]] world, printing, especially in Arabic or Turkish, was strongly opposed throughout the [[early modern period]], though printing in [[Hebrew]] was sometimes permitted.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Muslim countries have been regarded as a barrier to the passage of printing from China to the West. According to an imperial ambassador to [[Istanbul]] in the middle of the sixteenth century, it was a sin for the [[Turkish people|Turks]] to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan [[Selim I]] issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. At the end of the century, Sultan [[Murad III]] permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in [[Arabic]] characters, yet the majority were imported from [[Italy]].

[[Jew]]s were banned from German printing [[guild]]s; as a result Hebrew printing sprang up in [[Italy]], beginning in 1470 in [[Rome]], then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno and Mantuba. Local rulers had the authority to grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2009&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/books/12hebr.html?_r=1 A Lifetimeâs Collection of Texts in Hebrew, at Sothebyâs]&quot;, [[Edward Rothstein]], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and many of those printed during this period carry the words 'con licenza de superiori' (indicating their printing having been licensed by the censor) on their title pages.

It was thought that the introduction of the printing medium 'would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyrowitz41&quot;&gt;Meyrowitz: &quot;Mediating Communication: What Happens?&quot; in &quot;Questioning the Media&quot;, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The consequences of printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyrowitz41&quot; /&gt; used the example of [[William Carter (martyr)|William Carter]] who in [[1584]] printed a pro-[[Catholic]] pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was [[hanging]].

The widespread distribution of the Bible 'had a revolutionary impact, because it decreased the power of the Catholic Church as the prime possessor and interpretor of God's word.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Meyrowitz41&quot; /&gt;

===Social impact===
Print gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones. Print, according to [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] in his lecture On the Study of History (1895), gave &quot;assurance that the work of the [[Renaissance]] would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the [[Middle Ages]] would never recur, that not an idea would be lost&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briggs-Burke&quot; /&gt;

Print was instrumental in changing the nature of reading within society.

[[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] identifies two long term effects of the invention of printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for knowledge as well as allowing for comparison between incompatible views. (Eisenstein in Briggs and Burke, 2002: p21)

[[Asa Briggs]] and [[Peter Burke]] identify five kinds of reading that developed in relation to the introduction of print:
# Critical reading: due to the fact that texts finally became accessible to the general population, critical reading emerged because people were given the option to form their own opinions on texts.
# Dangerous Reading: reading was seen as a dangerous pursuit because it was considered rebellious and unsociable. This was especially in the case of women because reading could stir up dangerous emotions like love. There was also the concern that if women could read, they could read love notes.
# Creative reading: Printing allowed people to read texts and interpret them creatively, often in very different ways than the author intended.
# Extensive Reading: Print allowed for a wide range of texts to become available, thus, previous methods of intensive reading of texts from start to finish, began to change. With texts being readily available, people began reading on particular topics or chapters, allowing for much more extensive reading on a wider range of topics.
# Private reading: This is linked to the rise of individualism. Before print, reading was often a group event, where one person would read to a group of people. With print, literacy rose as did availability of texts, thus reading became a solitary pursuit.

The invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. [[Printer (publisher)|Printers]] emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, although the much more labour-intensive occupation of the [[scribe]] naturally declined.  Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the amount of [[bookselling|booksellers]] and [[librarian]]s naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.

==Digital printing==
[[Digital printing]] accounts for approximately 9% of the 45 trillion pages printed annually (2005 figure) around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;vj_ipg2-0_keynote&quot;/&gt;

Printing at home or in an [[office]] or engineering environment is subdivided into:
*small format (up to ledger size paper sheets), as used in business offices and libraries
*wide format (up to 3' or 914mm wide rolls of paper), as used in drafting and design establishments.

Some of the more common printing technologies are:

*[[blueprint]]âand related chemical technologies.
*[[daisy wheel]]âwhere pre-formed characters are applied individually.
*[[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix]]âwhich produces arbitrary patterns of dots with an array of printing studs.
*[[line printer|line printing]]âwhere pre-formed characters are applied to the paper by lines.
*[[thermal printer|heat transfer]]âlike early fax machines or modern receipt printers that apply heat to special paper, which turns black to form the printed image.
*[[inkjet]]âincluding bubble-jetâwhere ink is sprayed onto the paper to create the desired image.
*[[electrophotography]]âwhere [[toner]] is attracted to a charged image and then developed.
*[[laser printing|laser]]âa type of [[xerography]] where the charged image is written pixel by pixel by a laser.
*[[solid ink]] printerâwhere [[cube]]s of ink are melted to make ink or liquid toner.

Vendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems beat inkjet in the long run, whereas inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.

Professional [[digital printing]] (using [[toner]]) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate it is printed on. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black &amp; white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses like the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP [[Indigo Digital Press]] series and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.

Small press and fanzines generally use [[digital printing]]. Prior to the introduction of cheap photocopying the use of machines such as the [[spirit duplicator]], [[hectograph]], and [[mimeograph]] was common.

==3D printing==
[[3D printing]] is a form of  manufacturing technology where objects are created using three dimensional files and [[3D printers]]. Objects are created by laying down successive layers of material. Some companies such as [[Sculpteo]] or Shapeways are proposing online solutions for 3D printing.
