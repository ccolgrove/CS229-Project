Kerala is abundant in greenery and nature. Kerala is often referred to as ''Keralam'' by the natives (''[[Malayali]]s'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2cbCr7M4SJ8C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=keralam&amp;q=keralam|title=Asceticism and its critics: historical accounts and comparative perspectives|author=Oliver Freiberger|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=0195307917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars agree that ''Kerala'' transliterates [[Tamil language|Classical Tamil]] ''Cheralam'' (&quot;Land of the [[Chera Dynasties|Cheras]]&quot;) or ''chera-alam'', (&quot;[[wikt:declivity|declivity]] of a hill or a mountain slope/range&quot;).

===Prehistory===
[[Image:MarayoorDolmen.JPG|thumb|left|200 px|A [[dolmen]] erected by Neolithic people in [[Marayur]].]]
{{Main|Pre-history of Kerala}}
Evidence of Kerala's early human occupation includes [[Dolmen]]s of the [[Neolithic]] era, in the [[Marayur]] area. They are locally known as &quot;muniyara&quot;, derived from ''muni'' ([[hermit]] or [[Index of religious honorifics and titles|sage]], and ''ara'' (dolmen).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/12/06/stories/2004120604900300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Unlocking the secrets of history | date=6 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rock-engravings in the [[Edakkal Caves]] (in [[Wayanad]]) are thought to date from the early to Late Neolithic eras around 5000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/30/stories/2007103054660500.htm Hindu.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topnews.in/edakkal-caves-re-excavated-after-114-years-kerala-229742 Edakkal caves re-excavated after 114 years in Kerala | TopNews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kerala.gov.in/disttourism/wyd.htm Tourism information on districts â Wayanad], official website of the Govt. of Kerala&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a specific [[Indus script]] pictogram in these caves suggests some relationship with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] during the late [[Bronze Age]] and early [[Iron age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/article26324.ece | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Symbols akin to Indus valley culture discovered in Kerala | date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history and culture===
Kerala was a major spice exporter as early as 3,000 BCE, according to [[Sumer|Sumerian Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=6jF4Q5jQWboC&amp;pg=PA392 Faces of Goa: a journey through the history and cultural revolution of Goa and other communities influenced by the Portuguese] By Karin Larsen (Page 392)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=gOrvghLklKoC ''Striving for sustainability, environmental stress and democratic initiatives in Kerala''](page 79) ISBN 81-8069-294-9; Author: Srikumar Chattopadhyay, Richard W. Franke; Year: 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerala and [[Tamil Nadu]] once shared a common language and culture, within an area known as [[Sangam period|Tamilakam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kanakasabhai|1997|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century BCE, [[Dravidian languages#History|Tamil]]-speaking [[Dravidians|Dravidian]] [[Villavar]]s{{Clarify|date=May 2011}} established the [[Chera Dynasty]] that ruled northern Kerala&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sadasivan|2000|pp=105â6}}&lt;/ref&gt; from a capital at [[Vanchi (Indian Capital)|Vanchi]]. Southern Kerala was ruled by the [[Pandyan Kingdom]], with a trading port variously identified by ancient Western sources as &quot;Nelcynda&quot; and &quot;Neacyndi&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Books.google.co.in&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=rQipbjusDyQC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=nelcynda |title=History of ancient geography â Google Books |author=James Oliver Thomson|publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers, 1948|date= |accessdate=30 July 2009|isbn=9780819601438|year=1948}}.

The value of Rome's annual trade with India as a whole was estimated at no less than 50,000,000 [[sesterces]];&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Pliny the Elder]], goods from India were sold in the Empire at 100 times their original purchase price.

A later [[Chera Dynasty|Chera Kingdom]] was established c. 800â1102, with the help of Arab spice merchants. This is also called the [[Kulasekhara|Kulasekhara dynasty]], as it was founded by Kulasekhara Varman, a [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavaite]] saint. [[Ays (Kerala)|Ay]] kings ruled southern Kerala, but by the 10th century the Ay kingdom declined and became a part of the Chera Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=EXIeAAAAMAAJ In quest of Kerala] By K.

From these, the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]], [[Venad]], [[Kolathiri]] and [[History of Kozhikode|Kozhikode]] [[Samuthiri]] emerged.

=== The Colonial Era ===
[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|200 px|This figure illustrates the path of Vasco da Gama heading for the first time to India (black line)]]
The western spice-trade, especially in [[Black pepper|pepper]], became increasingly lucrative. Around the 13th century, the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] began to dominate the eastern shipping trade in general, and the spice-trade in particular, culminating in [[Vasco Da Gama]]'s arrival in [[Kappad]] [[Kozhikode]] in 1498.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ravindran PN |title=Black Pepper: Piper Nigrum |publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |accessdate=11 November 2007 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=VaGCgSLrdr4C |page=3 |isbn=9789057024535 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Curtin PD |title=Cross-Cultural Trade in World History |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-5212-6931-8 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mundadan_1984&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mundadan AM |year=1984 |title=Volume I: From the Beginning up to the Sixteenth Century (up to 1542) |series=History of Christianity in India |publisher=Theological Publications |others=Church History Association of India |location=Bangalore }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 March 1505, [[Francisco de Almeida]] was appointed Viceroy of Portuguese India, with headquarters at [[Kochi, India|Kochi]]. The Portuguese had taken advantage of conflicts between [[Saamoothiri|Kozhikode]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]] to gain control of the trade, and established forts at [[Kannur]], [[Cochin]] and [[Kollam]]{{citation}} but the [[Saamoothiri]] of Kozikode and his [[admiral]] [[Kunjali Marakkar]] resisted, and in 1571 the Portuguese were [[Vettathunad#Battles at the Chaliyam Fort|defeated at Chaliyam fort]].

The weakened Portuguese were ousted by the [[Dutch East India Company]], who took advantage of continuing conflicts between [[Saamoothiri|Kozhikode]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]] to gain control of the trade. The Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with [[Marthanda Varma]] of the [[Travancore Royal Family]], and were defeated at the [[Battle of Colachel]] in 1741. The Dutch were allied to French forces in the transcontinental [[Napoleonic Wars]]; forces of the [[British East India Company]] marched against them from [[Calicut]] and took their surrender and possessions on 20 Oct 1795.

===Post Independence===
After [[British India]] was [[Partition of India|partitioned]] in 1947 into India and [[Pakistan]], [[Travancore]] and [[Kingdom of Cochin|Cochin]] joined the [[Union of India]] and on 1 July 1949 were merged to form [[Travancore-Cochin]]. On 1 January 1950 ([[Republic Day of India|Republic Day]]), [[Travancore-Cochin]] was recognised as a state. The [[Madras Presidency]] was organised to form [[Madras State]] in 1947.

On 1 November 1956, the state of Kerala was formed by the [[States Reorganisation Act]] merging the Malabar district, Travancore-Cochin (excluding four southern [[tehsil|taluks]], which were merged with Tamil Nadu), and the taluk of [[Kasaragod Town|Kasargod]], [[South Kanara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Plunkett&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Plunkett|Cannon|Harding|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly were held, and a reformist, Communist-led government came to power, under [[E.M.S.

The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala by name is the [[Aitareya Aranyaka]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lit&quot; /&gt;

The legendary king [[Mahabali]] is said to have ruled from Kerala in a reign of universal happiness and prosperity. On his passing away he was appointed ruler of the netherworld (''Patalam'') by ''[[Vamana]]'', the fifth ''avatar'' of Lord ''[[Vishnu]]''. There is a belief that, Once a year, during the [[Onam]] festival, he returns to Kerala.

In the religious texts known as the [[Puranas]], Kerala is ''Parasurama Kshetram'' (&quot;The Land of Parasurama&quot;). [[Parasurama]] was a warrior sage and an [[Avatar]] of [[Mahavishnu]].

Kerala is wedged between the [[Lakshadweep sea]] and the [[Western Ghats]]. Lying between north latitudes 8Â°18' and 12Â°48' and east longitudes 74Â°52' and 77Â°22',&lt;ref name = &quot;GOK_2005b&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/knowindia/st_kerala.php Kerala â States and Union Territories â Know India] National Portal of India&lt;/ref&gt; Kerala experiences the humid [[equatorial climate|equatorial tropic climate]].

Geographically, Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands (rugged and cool mountainous terrain), the central midlands (rolling hills), and the western lowlands (coastal plains). Located at the extreme southern tip of the [[Indian subcontinent]], Kerala lies near the centre of the [[Indian Plate|Indian]] [[tectonic plate]]; hence, most of the state is subject to comparatively little [[earthquake|seismic]] and volcanic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite map |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |year=2002 |title=Map Showing Multi Hazard Zones in Kerala |url=http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/Multihazard/Maps/Multihazard/kerala.jpg |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061108004906/http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/Multihazard/Maps/Multihazard/kerala.jpg |archivedate=8 November 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pre-Cambrian]] and [[Pleistocene]] geological formations compose the bulk of Keralaâs terrain.
[[Image:Anamudi.jpg|thumb|left|230 px|Anamudi from [[Eravikulam National Park]]]]

The eastern Kerala region consists of high mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys immediately west of the Western Ghats' [[rain shadow]]. Forty-one of Keralaâs west-flowing rivers, and three of its east-flowing ones originate in this region. The Western Ghats form a wall of mountains interrupted only near [[Palakkad]], where the [[Palakkad Gap]] breaks through to provide access to the rest of India. The Western Ghats rises on average to 1,500&amp;nbsp;m (4920&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level, while the highest peaks may reach to 2,500&amp;nbsp;m (8200&amp;nbsp;ft). [[Anamudi]] is the highest peak at an elevation of 2,695 metres (8,842&amp;nbsp;ft). Just west of the mountains lie the midland plains comprising central Kerala, dominated by rolling hills and valleys.&lt;ref name = &quot;GOK_2005b&quot;/&gt; Generally ranging between elevations of 250â1,000&amp;nbsp;m (820â3300&amp;nbsp;ft), the eastern portions of the [[Nilgiri Hills|Nilgiri]] and [[Palni Hills]] include such formations as [[Agastya Mala]] and [[Anamala]].

Keralaâs western coastal belt is relatively flat, and is criss-crossed by a network of interconnected [[brackish]] [[canal]]s, lakes, [[estuary|estuaries]], and rivers known as the [[Kerala Backwaters]]. Lake [[Vembanad Lake|Vembanad]], Keralaâs largest body of water, dominates the Backwaters; it lies between [[Alappuzha]] and [[Kochi]] and is more than {{convert|200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in area. Around 8% of India's waterways (measured by length) are found in Kerala.&lt;ref name=&quot;IWAI_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Inland Waterways Authority of India|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important of Keralaâs [[List of rivers in Kerala|forty-four rivers]] include the [[Periyar River|Periyar]] (244&amp;nbsp;km), the [[Bharathapuzha]] (209&amp;nbsp;km), the [[Pamba River|Pamba]] (176&amp;nbsp;km), the [[Chaliyar River|Chaliyar]] (169&amp;nbsp;km), the [[Kadalundipuzha River]] (130&amp;nbsp;km), the [[Valapattanam River|Valapattanam]] (129&amp;nbsp;km) and the [[Achankovil River|Achankovil]] (128&amp;nbsp;km). The average length of the rivers of Kerala is 64&amp;nbsp;km. Many of the rivers are small and entirely fed by [[monsoon]] rains.&lt;ref name = &quot;GOK_2005b&quot;/&gt; These conditions result in the nearly year-round water logging of such western regions as [[Kuttanad]], 500&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² of which lies below sea level. As Kerala's rivers are small and lack [[river delta|deltas]], they are more prone to environmental factors. The rivers also face problems such as sand mining and pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Padmalal&quot;&gt;Padmalal D, Maya K, Sreebha S &amp; Sreeja R, 2007, Environmental effects of river sand mining: a case from the river catchments of [[Vembanad lake]], Southwest coast of India, Environmental Geology 54(4), 879â889.

==Subdivisions==
{{Main|Districts of Kerala|Corporations, municipalities and taluks of Kerala}}

[[Districts of Kerala|Kerala's fourteen districts]] are distributed among Kerala's six historical regions: North Malabar (Far-north Kerala), South Malabar (northern Kerala), Kochi (central Kerala), Northern Travancore, Central Travancore (southern Kerala) and Southern Travancore (Far-south Kerala). Kerala's modern-day districts (listed in order from north to south) correspond to them as follows:

''Note that these subdivisions are historical and unofficial, that there was no official subdivisions such as South Malabar-North Malabar, or South-Central-North Travancore''
* [[North Malabar]]: [[Kasaragod District|Kasaragod]], [[Kannur District|Kannur]], [[Mananthavady]] Taluk of [[Wayanad District|Wayanad]], [[Koyilandy]] and [[Vadakara]] Taluks of [[Kozhikode District|Kozhikode]]

* [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]]: A part of [[Ernakulam District|Ernakulam]], [[Chittur|Chittur Taluk]] and [[Alathur|Alathur Taluk]]s of [[Palakkad District|Palakkad]], and a majority part of [[Thrissur District|Thrissur]].
* [[Northern Travancore]]: Part of [[Ernakulam District|Ernakulam]], and [[Idukki District|Idukki]].
* [[Central Travancore]]: Southern part of [[Idukki District|Idukki]], [[Kottayam District|Kottayam]], [[Alappuzha District|Alappuzha]], [[Pathanamthitta District|Pathanamthitta]] and northern part of [[Kollam District|Kollam]].
* [[Southern Travancore]]: Southern part of [[Kollam District|Kollam]], [[Thiruvananthapuram District|Thiruvananthapuram]]. Nanchinad in [[Kanyakumari]], which is now in the state of [[Tamil Nadu]], was also part of southern Travancore before formation of Kerala.

Kerala's 14 districts, which serve as the administrative regions for taxation purposes, are further subdivided into 63 [[tehsil|taluks]]; these have fiscal and administrative powers over settlements within their borders, including maintenance of local land records.[[Taluks of Kerala|Taluks of kerala]] are further divided into 1453 revenue villages and 1007 [[Gram panchayat]]s.

=== Roads ===
{{Main|Roads in Kerala}}
Kerala has {{convert|145704|km|mi}} of roads (4.2% of India's total). This translates to about {{convert|4.62|km|mi|2}} of road per thousand population, compared to an all India average of {{convert|2.59|km|mi|2}}. Virtually all of Kerala's villages are connected by road.

Roads in Kerala includes 1,524&amp;nbsp;km of National highway (2.6% of nation's total), 4341.6&amp;nbsp;km of state highway and 18900&amp;nbsp;km of district roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keralapwd.net/pwd/public/about.jsp keralapwd.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through two [[List of National Highways in India|national highways]], [[National Highway 47 (India)|NH 47]], and [[National Highway 17 (India)|NH 17]] and eastern side is accessible through various State Highways. There is also a [[Hill Highway (Kerala)]] proposed, to make easy access to eastern hills.

[[National Highway 17|NH 17]] connects [[Edapally]] (Kochi) to Panavel (near Mumbai) and is the longest stretch of national highway through the state. The other major national highway passing through the state is [[National Highway 47 (India)|National Highway 47]] which connects [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] to Kanyakumari and passes through the major towns and cities like [[Palakkad]], [[Thrissur]], [[Kochi]], [[Alappuzha]], [[Kollam]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]].

Traffic in Kerala has been growing at a rate of 10â11% every year, resulting in high traffic and pressure on the roads. [[Roads in Kerala|Kerala's road]] density is nearly four times the national average, reflecting the state's high population density. Kerala's annual total of road accidents is among the nation's highest. The accidents are mainly result of the narrow roads and irresponsible driving.

=== Inland Water Transport in Kerala ===
Kerala, with numerous backwaters, is one of the States in India, where waterways are successfully used for commercial Inland Water Transport. The transportation is mainly done with country craft and passenger vessels. There are 41 navigable rivers in Kerala. The total length of the Inland Waterways in the State is 1687&amp;nbsp;km. The main constraints to the expansion of Inland Water transport in the State are lack of depth in the waterway caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation system and bank protection, accelerated growth of the water hyacinth, lack of modern inland craft terminals and cargo handling system.
A 205&amp;nbsp;km canal, [[National Waterway 3 (India)|National Waterway 3]], runs between Kottapuram and Kochi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iwai.gov.in/waterwaysnw3.html Inland Waterways Authority of India website]&lt;/ref&gt;

An upper primary school within a distance of 3&amp;nbsp;km is available for more than 96% of the people, whose 98% benefit the facility for secondary education within 8&amp;nbsp;km. The access for rural students to higher educational institutions in cities is facilitated by widely subsidised transport fares.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Schools and colleges are run by the government, private trusts, or individuals. Many of the schools owned by private sector are aided by government. Most{{Weasel-inline|date=May 2011}} of the public schools are affiliated to [[Kerala State Education Board]]. Other familiar educational boards are [[Indian Certificate of Secondary Education]] (ICSE), the [[CBSE|Central Board for Secondary Education]] (CBSE), or the [[NIOS|National Institute of Open Schooling]] (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most self financing schools, while government and government aided schools offer English or Malayalam{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

No fees (or a nominal fees) are required in schools run by or aided by government.
Fees concerning the higher and technical education are very low; the ratio of recovery of government's revenue expenditure was 2.6% in 2006â2007.&lt;ref&gt;Najith Kumar, K.K. George, &quot;Kerala's education system: from inclusion to exclusion&quot;, [[Economic and Political Weekly]], 10 October 2009, VOL XLIV, NO 41, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lacking of fees or low fees does not imply low educational cost, as the students incur other costs of several types (examination fees, special fees, material costs, clothing travelling, private tuition). In fact, according to the 61st round of National Sample Survey (2004â2005), per capita spending on education by the rural households resulted to be more than twice the national average ({{Indian Rupee}} 41 for Kerala, {{Indian Rupee}} 18 for India).Urban India spending, on the contrary, resulted to be greater than Kerala's ({{Indian Rupee}} 74 for India, {{Indian Rupee}} 66 for Kerala). However, the survey reveals that the rural-urban difference in expenditure on education by households was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India.&lt;ref&gt;Najith Kumar, K.K.

''Kathakali'' and ''Mohiniattam'' are widely recognized Indian Classical Dance traditions from Kerala.

Other forms of art are more religious or tribal in nature. These include ''[[chavittu nadakom]]'' and ''[[oppana]]'' which combines dance, rhythmic hand clapping, and ''ishal'' vocalisations. ''[[Margam Kali]]'' is a traditional group dance form traceable back to 17th century, originally performed during [[Saint Thomas Christians|Syrian Christian]] festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/29/stories/2011042950750200.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Preserving the purity of Margamkali | date=29 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these art forms are largely performed for tourists or at youth festivals, and are not as popular among most Keralites. Contemporary art and performance styles including those employing mimicry and parody are more popular.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[Music of Kerala|Kerala's music]] also has ancient{{Weasel-inline|date=May 2011}} roots. [[Carnatic music]] dominates Keralite traditional music. This was the result of [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma]]'s popularisation of the genre in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagyalekshmy_2004d_29&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bhagyalekshmy|2004d|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bhagyalekshmy_2004d_32&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bhagyalekshmy|2004d|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Raga-based renditions known as ''sopanam'' accompany ''kathakali'' performances. ''Melam'' (including the ''paandi'' and ''panchari'' variants) is a more percussive style of music; it is performed at ''[[mandir|Kshetram]]'' centered festivals using the ''[[chenda]]''. ''Melam'' ensembles comprise up to 150 musicians, and performances may last up to four hours. ''Panchavadyam'' is a different form of percussion ensemble, in which up to 100 artists use five types of percussion instrument. Kerala has various styles of folk and tribal music. The popular music of Kerala is dominated by the ''[[filmi]]'' music of [[Indian cinema]]. Kerala's visual arts range from [[Murals of Kerala|traditional murals]] to the works of [[Raja Ravi Varma]], the state's most renowned painter.

Kolla Varsham or Malayalam Era, which is assumed to have been established by King Udaya Marthanda Varma in 825 CE, serves as the official calendar of Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/disttourism/klm.htm |title=Official website |publisher=kerala.gov.in |date= |accessdate=30 July 2009}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Malayalam calendar]] is used to plan agricultural and religious activities. Kerala's most popular dish is ''[[Rice and curry]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The ''[[sadhya]]'' (feast) is traditionally served on green banana leaves. Such dishes as ''[[idli]]'', ''[[payasam]]'', ''pulisherry'', ''puttukadala'', or PuttuPayarPappadam, ''puzhukku'', ''[[rasam]]'', and ''[[sambar (dish)|sambar]]'' are typical. Keralitesâboth men and women alikeâtraditionally don flowing and unstitched garments. These include the ''[[mundu]]'', a loose piece of cloth wrapped around men's waists. Women typically wear the ''[[sari]]'', a long and elaborately wrapped banner of cloth, wearable in various styles. Presently, North Indian dresses such as [[Salwar kameez]] are also popular among women in Kerala.

[[elephants in Kerala culture|Elephants]] are an integral part of daily life in Kerala.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} [[Indian elephant]]s are loved, revered, groomed and given a prestigious place in the state's culture. They are often referred to as {{By whom|date=May 2011}} the 'sons of the ''[[sahyadri|sahya]]''.' Elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the [[Government of Kerala]].

[[Malayalam literature]] is medieval in origin and includes such figures as the 14th century [[Niranam poets]] (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), and the 17th century poet [[Ezhuthachan|Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan]] whose works mark the dawn of both modern Malayalam language and indigenous Keralite poetry.  [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar]] and [[Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran]] are noted for their contribution to Malayalam prose. The &quot;[[triumvirate poets of modern malayalam|triumvirate of poets]]&quot; (''Kavithrayam''), [[Kumaran Asan]], [[Vallathol Narayana Menon]], and [[Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer]], are recognised for moving Keralite poetry away from archaic sophistry and metaphysics, and towards a more [[lyrics|lyrical]] mode.

In the second half of the 20th century, [[Jnanpith]] awardees like [[G. Sankara Kurup]], [[S. K. Pottekkatt]], [[Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai]], [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]] and [[O. N. V.
