A group of activists issued the &quot;People's CommuniquÃ© No 1&quot;, which imitated the titles of communiquÃ©s from the Army. It demanded the dissolution of the cabinet Mubarak appointed on 29 January, the suspension of the parliament elected in late 2010 in a poll that was widely suspected of being rigged, the creation of a transitional presidential council made up of four civilians and one member of the military, the formation of a transitional government to prepare for an election to take place within nine months and a body to draft a new democratic constitution, freedom for the media and syndicates and for the formation of political parties, and the scrapping of military and emergency courts. They also announced the formation of a council to organize mass protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuterscomm1&quot;&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/12/us-egypt-protesters-idUSTRE71B17Q20110212 Egypt protest leaders vow to protect revolution].

[[Jean-Claude Juncker]], the chairman of the [[Eurogroup]], said he would support a freeze on the assets of Hosni Mubarak.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazbloglive14feb&quot; /&gt;

After an inventory was completed, it was determined that a total of 18 artifacts from the Egyptian Museum were missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110213/D9LBRGK80.html |title=18 items missing from Egyptian Museum after unrest |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 70 objects were damaged.

It was reported that the secretary-general of the [[Arab League]], [[Amr Moussa]], was to stand down and run in the upcoming elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/02/11/feel_the_moussa_mentum |title=Feel the Moussa-mentum? &amp;#124; FP Passport |publisher=Blog.foreignpolicy.com |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight representatives from the demonstrators, including [[Wael Ghonim]] and Amr Salama, met with spokespersons of the military and reported that there would be a [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2011|referendum on changes to the constitution]] within two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP)&amp;nbsp;â 9 hours ago |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gyvIy92hyHZzDwY3N_T-NwAdrdeQ?docId=CNG.64b40623ef755670eb1e7e108c8d3448.801 |title=AFP: Egypt cyber activists say they met military rulers |publisher=Google  |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military rulers called for an end to the strikes and protests. Thousands of state employees, including police, transit workers, and ambulance drivers, protested for better pay. In a statement, the ruling military council issued a final warning to the labor unions stating that the armed forces could intervene. They also imposed an outright ban on gatherings and strikes. In addition, the army cleared out most of the remaining demonstrators from Tahrir Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110214/D9LCKQL01.html |title=Egyptian labor unrest grows after uprising |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adly Fayed, the director of public security at the interior ministry, and Ismail El Shaer, Cairo's security chief, have been fired over their decision to open fire on the demonstrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

On 17 February, the army stated that it would not field a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forexyard.com/en/news/Egypt-army-says-wont-field-presidential-candidate-2011-02-17T144839Z |title=Egypt army says won't field presidential candidate |publisher=Forexyard.com |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four important figures of the former regime were detained on that day: former interior minister [[Habib el-Adly]], former minister of housing Ahmed Maghrabi, former tourism minister Zuheir Garana, and steel tycoon [[Ahmed Ezz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12500968 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;â Egypt after Mubarak: Three ex-ministers arrested |publisher=BBC   |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 February, Muslim cleric [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] arrived in Egypt after his exile in [[Qatar]] and led the &quot;Victory Day&quot; Friday sermon in Tahrir Square, which was attended by hundreds of thousands of people. Men, who appeared to be Qaradawi's guards, barred [[Wael Ghonim]] from joining him on stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Egypt-protest-hero-Wael-Ghonim-barred-from-stage/Article1-663996.aspx |title=Egypt protest hero Wael Ghonim barred from stage |work=Hindustan Times |location=India |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0218/Egypt-revolution-unfinished-Qaradawi-tells-Tahrir-masses |title=Egypt revolution unfinished, Qaradawi tells Tahrir masses |publisher=CSMonitor.com |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.trend.az/regions/met/arabicr/1832138.html |title=Mass protests as Egyptians mark &quot;Victory Day&quot; &amp;#124; Arabic region &amp;#124; Trend |publisher=En.trend.az |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that same day, Wael Ghonim wrote the following on his Twitter: &quot;I loved Sheikh Qaradawi Khutbah today.

On 20 February, the constitutional reform committee stated that its work was almost done,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90854/7293319.html |title=Egypt's constitutional amendments almost done: committee&amp;nbsp;â People's Daily Online |work=People's Daily  |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also announced that the caretaker government would soon be reshuffled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90854/7293328.html |title=Egyptian caretaker government to reshuffle soon: PM&amp;nbsp;â People's Daily Online |work=People's Daily  |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 21 February, [[David Cameron]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, became the first world leader to visit Egypt since Mubarak was ousted as the president. A news blackout was lifted as the prime minister landed in Cairo for a brief five-hour stopover, which had been hastily added to the start of a planned tour of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/feb/21/david-cameron-visits-egypt?CMP=twt_fd |title=David Cameron visits Egypt&amp;nbsp;â The Guardian |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 February 2011|accessdate=21 February 2011  |first=Nicholas |last=Watt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A government reshuffle took place on 22 February, but the defense, interior, foreign, finance, and justice ministries remained unchanged. New ministers included Yehia el-Gamal as deputy prime minister, the [[New Wafd Party]]'s [[Monir Fakhri Abdel Nour]] as tourism minister, the [[Tagammu Party]]'s Gowdat Abdel-Khaleq as minister of social solidarity and social justice, and Ismail Ibrahim Fahmy as the new labor minister. The changes were not well-received by the public, because most of Mubarak's former supporters remained in the cabinet, and there were renewed calls for a demonstration to demand the resignation of the interim government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Reuters |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/egypt-swears-in-new-cabinet-retains-mubarak-era-ministers-1.345069 |title=Egypt swears in new cabinet, retains Mubarak-era ministers&amp;nbsp;â Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |work=Haaretz |location=Israel |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters were also set to return to Tahrir Square to keep up the pressure on the interim government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFTRE70O18Y20110225 |title=Egyptians pack Tahrir for protest and celebration &amp;#124; World &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Af.reuters.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before any large protests against him were planned, [[Ahmed Shafik]] stepped down as Prime Minister and was replaced by [[Essam Sharaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forexyard.com/en/news/Egypts-prime-minsiter-quits-new-govt-soon-army-2011-03-03T093300Z |title=Egypt's prime minsiter &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt; quits, new govt soon-army |publisher=Forexyard.com |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharaf returned to [[Tahrir Square]], which he had also visited during the revolution, to address the Friday mass rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/egypt_sharaf/2328017.html |title=Egypt Protesters Storm Security Facility |publisher=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foreign, justice, interior, and oil ministers resigned and three new ministers were named: General and former governor of [[Minya Governorate|Minya]], [[Mansour El Essawi]], became interior minister; Mohamed Abdel Aziz Al-Guindy became justice minister; and former judge [[Nabil Elaraby]] was appointed foreign minister.

On 5 March, three weeks after Hosni Mubarak was ousted as President, Egyptians turned their anger toward his internal security apparatus by storming the agency's main headquarters and other offices in order to seize documents that would provide evidence of human rights abuses as well as preventing said documents from being destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2011/03/05/egyptians_storm_state_security_building_in_cairo/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+Boston+Globe+--+World+News |title=Egyptians turn anger toward state security agency |publisher=http://www.boston.com/news |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following rumors that officials were destroying evidence, 200 protesters stormed the secret police headquarters in Cairo. The closing of the agency has been a key demand of the protesters but one which had not been heeded. Human rights abuses, including torture, were alleged to have been carried out inside it. The protesters stated that they stormed the building to secure evidence as they feared that it might be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12657464 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;â Egypt: Protesters raid on Cairo state security HQ |publisher=BBC   |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSIS was announced dissolved on 15 March 2011, with a new National Security Force replacing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12751234 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;â Egypt dissolves notorious internal security agency |publisher=BBC   |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of youths who participated in the protests announced the formation of the Party of Youths for Change on 6 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/7310110.html |title=Egyptian youths to form new political party&amp;nbsp;â People's Daily Online |work=People's Daily  |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohamed ElBaradei]] stated on 9 March 2011 that he would run in the presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aysor.am/en/news/2011/03/09/egyote-baradei/ |title=ElBaradei to run for president of Egypt&amp;nbsp;â aysor.am&amp;nbsp;â Hot news from Armenia |publisher=aysor.am |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March, the [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2011|constitutional referendum]] was held, with millions of Egyptians turning up to vote on nine proposed amendments to the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/20113196242356485.html |title=High turnout in Egyptian constitutional poll&amp;nbsp;â Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eager for their first free vote, Egyptians formed long lines outside polling centers to cast their ballots on constitutional amendments that were sponsored by the ruling military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/tensions-high-as-egyptians-vote-in-first-post-mubarak-referendum-1.350149?localLinksEnabled=false |title=Tensions high as Egyptians vote in first post-Mubarak referendum |work=Haaretz |location=Israel |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead up to the referendum, there was still dispute amongst the political movements and parties in Egypt about whether they should approve or reject the proposed constitutional amendments. 16 of those political parties and movements, including The Alliance of Women's Organizations, announced that they would reject the proposed amendments and call for the creation of a new constitution. The movements also renewed their calls for protests against the amendments to be held. Supporters of the amendments include the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the Wasat Party, and the Labor Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/360386 |title=Egypt debates upcoming referendum on constitutional amendments  |publisher=almasryalyoum.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed amendments were limited to nine articles, which many deemed to be insufficient as they failed to limit the power of the president, whilst others argued that the amendments were only a temporary measure and as such did not need to include all the changes that were requested, as the Constitution was to be completely redrafted after the parliamentary and presidential elections. This point has proven to be the most contentious with those who oppose the amendments. They claim that a redrafted Constitution will not be representative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20110315214029.htm |title=Egypt debates upcoming referendum on constitutional amendments  |publisher=aina.org |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Egyptian presidential candidate [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] calling on all Egyptians to reject the proposed constitutional amendments, saying that a &quot;Yes&quot; vote will &quot;provide a parliament not representative of the people, composed mainly of members of the National Democratic Party and benefiting businessmen, the opportunity to uphold a Constitution which is also not representative of the people, and this will take us backwards to a great extent.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/360150 |title=ElBaradei calls on Egyptians to reject constitutional amendments |publisher=almasryalyoum.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ElBaradei was assaulted when he showed up at a school in Moqattam to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-03-19/world/egypt.referendum_1_polling-station-vote-today-egyptians?_s=PM:WORLD |title=ElBaradei attacked trying to vote in Egyptian referendum |publisher=CNN  |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final results of the referendum were announced the next day: 77.2% of Egyptians voted &quot;YES&quot; to constitutional amendments, while 22.8% voted &quot;NO&quot;. In total, 18,537,954 Egyptians voted out of around 45 million eligible voters, making the turnout 41%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/8125.aspx |title=Egypt referendum results: 77.2 per cent say 'Yes' to the amendments  |publisher=english.ahram.org.eg |date=20 March 2011 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April, protesters called for a &quot;Save the Revolution&quot; day in which thousands of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square after Friday prayers demanded that the ruling military council move faster to dismantle lingering aspects of the old regime; it was the largest protest since Mubarak's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/world/middleeast/02egypt.html?_r=1 |title=Protesters Scold Egyptâs Military Council |publisher=Neil MacFarquhar |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April, the Muslim Brotherhood called on its members to participate in the demonstrations in Tahrir Square on 8 April. Having withheld support for demonstrations held on 1 April because they coincided with Orphans' Day, the Brotherhood called for a large turnout to pressure the government to pursue cases against members of the old regime who remained in positions of influence after the revolution. The Brotherhood also suggested the name &quot;Friday of Purging&quot; for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/390242 |title=Brotherhood urges heavy participation in &quot;Friday of Purging&quot; |publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=3 April 2011|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, employees of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Amonsito Textile Company demonstrated outside cabinet offices.{{Why?|date=July 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/9295/Egypt/Politics-/Workers-protest-in-front-of-Egypts-Cabinet.aspx |title=Workers protest in front of Egypt's Cabinet&amp;nbsp;â Politics&amp;nbsp;â Egypt&amp;nbsp;â Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 April, Egyptian authorities arrested Omneya Soliman, the former housing minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/06/us-egypt-arrest-idUSTRE7352DL20110406 |title=Egypt arrests former housing minister Soliman |publisher=Reuters |date= 6 April 2011|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April, the National Association for Change seemed to accept the Brotherhood's proposal, calling for the &quot;Friday of Prosecution and Purging&quot;, a million-man march on Tahrir Square, on 8 April. The NAC also proposed holding a mock &quot;people's trial&quot; of the regime figures for whom they demand the prosecution and/or removal of. While Friday protests in Tahrir Square had been a weekly event, million-man protests had not been seen for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/390242 |title=NAC calls for &quot;Friday of Purging&quot; demonstration |publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=7 April 2011|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, protesters called for a &quot;Friday of Cleansing&quot; in which hundreds of thousands of demonstrators filled Tahrir Square again. They criticised the ruling SCAF for not following through on the protesters' previous demands. They called for the resignation of the remaining Mybarak-era figures and the removal of Egyptâs public prosecutor due to the slow pace of investigations of corrupt former officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/391552 |title=Tens of thousands in Tahrir as some threaten to extend protests &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April, the military used force to break up a camp that protesters had set up in Tahrir Square, as tensions also continued to build between the protesters and the military leadership that were running the country in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egyptian-military-uses-force-to-break-up-tahrir-square-protest/2011/04/09/AFTVpO6C_story.html |title=Egyptâs military forcibly breaks up Tahrir Square protest; 2 reported killed |work=Washington Post |date=9 April 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011 |first=Leila |last=Fadel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 May, it was announced that Mubarak and his two sons, Gamal and Alaa, would be tried over the deaths of anti-government protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13527102|title=Egypt: Hosni Mubarak and sons to be tried over deaths|date=24 May 2011|publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 May, Mubarak was fined $34m (Â£20m) for cutting off communications services during the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13585237|title=Egypt: Hosni Mubarak fined for cutting internet|date=28 May 2011|publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egypt also eased the blockade at the Rafah border crossing with [[Gaza]]. Women, children, and men over 40 were allowed to pass freely while men aged between 18 and 40 would still require a permit. Though trade across the border remained prohibited, the crossing was opened between 9:00 â 21:00 every day except on Fridays and public holidays.

On 6 June, crowds of Egyptians dressed in black held demonstrations to honour [[Khaled Said]], a young man from Alexandria who was beaten to death in 2010 in a savage attack which was blamed on police. This attack helped inspire the uprising that brought down Egypt's president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt remembers man whose death sparked revolution|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-06-06/world/29628236_1_large-protest-police-abuse-silent-demonstration|accessdate=1 July 2011|newspaper=SFGate.com|date=6 June 2011|deadurl=yes}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=A year since Khaled Saidâs death, Egypt still waits for justice|url=http://livewire.amnesty.org/2011/06/06/a-year-since-khaled-saids-death-egypt-still-waits-for-justice/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures of his body, taken by his family in a morgue, caused public outrage that caused the January 2011 uprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty1&quot;/&gt; Hundreds of protesters stood side by side on Stanley Bridge in Alexandria in a silent protest commemorating the death of Said. The protesters neither held pictures or banners of Said; they only carried the Egyptian flag. They then marched to Saidâs familyâs home in Cleopatra. By the time they arrived there, more people joined, and the number of protesters reached about 1,500. They set a big monitor on the street screening a documentary on Saidâs case and its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hundreds mark anniversary of Khaled Saeid's death in Alexandria, Cairo|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/egypt/hundreds-mark-anniversary-of-khaled-saeids-death-in-alexandria-cairo.html|publisher=thedailynewsegypt.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June, [[Ilan Grapel]], accused for being an Israeli spy, was [[Arrest of Ilan Grapel|arrested]] by Egyptian authorities, who claimed that Grapel was sent to Egypt to build a team that had been âtrying to gather information and data and to monitor the events of the 25 January revolution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newser1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt Accuses American of Spying for Israel|url=http://www.newser.com/story/120869/egypt-accuses-american-of-spying-for-israel.html|publisher=newser.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities also claimed that Grapel tried to incite violence amongst Egyptian protestors, hoping to spark a face-off with the military âand spread chaos in the Egyptian public and harm the state's political, economic, and social interests.â&lt;ref name=&quot;newser1&quot;/&gt; Grapel appears to be the same man who told Haaretz that he moved to Israel three years before its 2006 war with Lebanon and ended up enlisting in the Israeli Defense Force. Israel, however, has denied the reports, stating that âThere is no such thing, no Israeli agent has been arrested in Egypt. These reports are false.â  Friends and relatives of Grapel said that he is a law student in Atlanta with an avid interest in the Middle East, and not a Mossad agent out to sabotage Egyptâs revolution, as Egyptian authorities have charged. His mother said he arrived in Cairo in May, countering implications that he was involved in protests as early as February. The arrest of 27-year-old Ilan Grapel has sparked fears in Israel that relations with Egypt will sour now that Hosni Mubarak has been deposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt spy allegations against Israeli denied by family, classmates|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-14/news/29657736_1_israel-and-egypt-egyptian-revolution-mossad|work=Boston Globe |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Egyptian officials admitted Ilan Grapel was not a spy, and he was scheduled for release in exchange for 25 Egyptian prisoners held in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Azulay, Moran.

On 19 June, the military prosecution released the editor-in-chief of [[Al-Fagr]], Adel Hammouda, and journalist Rasha Azab without bail pending further investigation. They were both interrogated on charges of publishing false news that disturbed the peace and negligence in the editorial process. Hammouda was released at around 13&amp;nbsp;pm, while Azab was released at around 16:30&amp;nbsp;pm after which she immediately led chants of âdown with military rule.â&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegyptcivil&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Fagr journalists released pending further investigations|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/human-a-civil-rights/al-fagr-journalist-released-pending-further-investigations-dp1.html|publisher=thedailynewsegypt.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azab had written an article about a meeting between SCAF and prominent members of an advocacy group against military trials for civilians called âNo to Military Trialsâ in which group members provided SCAF with proof and evidence of military violations against civilians. Azab said that Major General Hassan El-Roweiny was astonished when he saw the pictures and testimonies. She added that El-Roweiny apologized to one of the female witnesses for being violated in military prison, adding that individual actions donât represent the morals or principles of the army.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegyptcivil&quot;/&gt;

On 20 June, Mubarak's lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, said that in 2010 the former president underwent &quot;critical surgery&quot; in Heidelberg, Germany to remove his gallbladder and part of his pancreas which were cancerous. el-Deeb told The Associated Press that &quot;there is evidence suggesting that there is a recurrence of cancer and that it has reached the stomach,&quot;. He called Mubarak's condition &quot;horrible&quot; and said the former leader &quot;doesn't eat and he loses consciousness quite often.&quot; Mubarak is hospitalized in Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where he has been living since he was removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lawyer says Egypt's Mubarak may have cancer|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Lawyer-says-Egypt-s-Mubarak-may-have-cancer-1429973.php|publisher=seattlepi.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June, Egypt's military rulers launched an online poll to test the popularity of potential presidential candidates, a move that could be aimed at judging public opinion for former officials who were trying to run for positions of parliament again. The list includes at least four ex-military officers as well as Islamists, judges, diplomats and others. Most have declared that they will run, including two former officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian army tests political winds|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Egyptian+army+tests+political+winds/4978519/story.html|publisher=http://www.montrealgazette.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June, Egypt's cabinet approved a budget for the 2011â2012 fiscal year, boosting spending in social programs to meet the growing demands from the people after the uprising. The budget totals Â£490.6&amp;nbsp;billion ($83&amp;nbsp;billion), reflecting a spending increase of 14.7% over the current fiscal year, while revenues are forecast at $59&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt approves $83B budget, boosts social spending|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/egypt-approves-83b-budget-boosts-social-spending-1.2976811|work=Newsday |location=New York |accessdate=1 July 2011}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, leaders of the youth wing of the Muslim Brotherhood have split with their elders to form an independent political party. This has deepened the fractures within the group as some of its prominent members have moved towards a more centrist and liberal version of Islamist politics. The new group, the ''Egyptian Current Party'', is expected to advocate the separation of religion from politics, the protection of individual freedoms and the embrace of Islamic morals and culture without the enforcement of Islamic religious law. Its founders, including Islam Lotfy, Mohamed el-Kasaas and Mohamed Abbas, were amongst the young leaders of the Egyptian revolution and broke with the Brotherhood to help lead the first day of protests that brought down Hosni Mubarak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Egypt, Youth Wing Breaks From Muslim Brotherhood|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/world/middleeast/23egypt.html|publisher=http://www.nytimes.com|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June, [[John McCain]] and [[John Kerry]] visited Egypt at the head of a U.S. business delegation. Both politicians said that it was in Americaâs national security interests to see that the uprising succeeded. They said that Washington was not interested in dictating policy to Egypt. Instead, the focus was on finding ways to help the Arab worldâs most populous nation boost its economy and address the needs of its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=McCain: Egypt military wants civilian government|url=http://www.longislandpress.com/2011/06/26/mccain-egypt-military-wants-civilian-government/|publisher=http://www.longislandpress.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June, Egyptian security forces clashed with around 5,000 protesters in central Cairo. According to witnesses and medical officials, dozens of demonstrators were injured. Clouds of tear gas engulfed Tahrir Square as the security forces battled to regain control of the central plaza from the demonstrators, many of whom had family members who were killed during the revolution. The families were frustrated with what they perceived to be the slow prosecution of security officers who were believed to be responsible for the deaths of some 850 protesters during the 18-day uprising in February. As Tuesday's clashes moved into early Wednesday morning, rocks and shattered glass littered the streets around Tahrir, as protesters chanted &quot;Down with the military junta&quot;. The demonstrators used motorcycles to ferry the injured to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian security forces fire tear gas to disperse rock-throwing protesters in central Cairo|url=http://www.newser.com/article/d9o57bl01/egyptian-security-forces-fire-tear-gas-to-disperse-rock-throwing-protesters-in-central-cairo.html|publisher=newser.com|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Health Ministry some 1,036 people were injured, among them at least 40 policemen. Early the next day there were still some demonstrators who were hurling stones at police near the ministry as commuters went to work.

They demanded immediate reforms and swifter [[Trials and judicial hearings following the 2011 Egyptian revolution|prosecution of former officials]] from the ousted government. Revolutionaries in Tahrir square also began another sit-in which is still ongoing.

Most of Egypt's political parties and coalitions supported widespread calls for the protest to be staged across Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/middleeast/2011/07/20117810134178303.html |title=New protests rage across Egypt&amp;nbsp;â Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters hoped to start a &quot;second revolution&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; The main demand of these groups is to combine efforts toward achieving the goals of the revolution, including: [[Human rights in Egypt under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|banning the trial of civilians by military courts]]; setting a minimum wage; bringing Mubarak, his sons and the senior officials to justice quickly; banning former National Democratic Party (NDP) members from political activity for five years; releasing all political prisoners; purging the police, the legal system, the media, the universities and the banks of members of the former regime; electing new municipal councils; stopping the export of natural gas to Israel;&lt;ref name=&quot;memri1&quot;/&gt; the arrest and trial of those responsible for killing protesters; and restructuring the ministry of interior. An employee of the [[Suez Canal University]] said that in [[Ismailiya]], there were also protests for higher wages and stable employment contracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;englishahram&quot;/&gt; Protesters also called for the removal of [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], who was said to be emblematic of the old regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt;

Several stages have been set up by the [[Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution|Revolution Youth Coalition]] (a coalition of liberal parties and movements), the Muslim Brotherhood, the Wafd party and leftist parties in order to organise the protests. As the Muslim Brotherhoodâs stage was the highest and largest, many protesters complained that they were attempting to gain an unfair advantage over the other political parties. These accusations were also compounded by the Muslim Brotherhood's opposition to a sit-in called by other political groups to pressure the Supreme Council of Armed Forces (SCAF) into meeting their demands. Though the Muslim Brotherhood decided to join the protests only two days before the event, it said that it would avoid the sit-in and leave by 17:00. The event was used to rally support for the various groups by organizing their own tents and passing out paraphernalia.&lt;ref name=&quot;englishahram&quot;/&gt;

On 9 July, Minister of Interior [[Mansour Essawy]] sacked the head of the Suez Security Police Osama El-Taweel and appointed Adel Abd El-Hamid as his replacement following clashes between families of those killed during the revolution and the Suez police. The clashes, in turn, followed accusations that the head of the Suez police had helped the police officers accused of killing protesters to escape trial after a court ruling released the officers on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/15974/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-interior-minister-replaces-Suez-police-ch.aspx |title=Egyptian interior minister replaces Suez police chief&amp;nbsp;â Politics&amp;nbsp;â Egypt&amp;nbsp;â Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Essam Sharaf also responded to the protests, saying that any member of the security forces who was accused of killing protesters would be sacked: &quot;I have issued new instructions as a matter of urgency for the minister of interior to suspend any officers implicated in the killing of protesters.

On 11 July, Prime Minister Essam Sharaf made a televised statement reassuring protesters that the government would respond to public demands and also included a timeline in which these demands would be met. The changes included a new cabinet to be formed within one week and a change in provincial governors before the end of the month. The protesters responded with calls for a million-man march the following day and continuation of their sit-in in Tahrir Square. The Muslim Brotherhood responded that they will not participate in the sit-in. The next morning the SCAF issued a statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thememriblog.org/blog_personal/en/39250.htm |title=Military Council in Egypt: We Support The People's Demands; We Will Not Submit to Protestor Violence |publisher=Thememriblog.org |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was perceived as aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_63395.shtml |title=Mass protests continue against Egyptian regimeWith Photo Essay &amp;#124; Egypt |publisher=Axisoflogic.com |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 July, state television reported that Egypt's government had met a key demand of protesters by firing nearly 700 top police officers in order to cleanse the discredited and widely unpopular force.&lt;ref name=&quot;newser2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newser.com/article/d9oesgcg2/state-tv-egypt-fires-nearly-700-senior-officers-as-part-of-cleansing-police-force.html |title=State TV: Egypt fires nearly 700 senior officers as part of cleansing police force â July 13, 2011 11:30:46&amp;nbsp;am |publisher=Newser |date=13 July 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that 37 of the dismissed officers face charges of killing protesters. Among those dismissed were 505 major-generals, including 10 of the interior minister's top assistants, 82 colonels and 82 brigadiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;newser2&quot;/&gt;

On 14 July, Mubarak told prosecutors that he did not order security forces to open fire on protesters during the initial uprising in February. Transcripts of prosecutors questioning Mubarak were published in two Egyptian newspapers{{Which?|date=July 2011}}, and judicial officials confirmed the authenticity of the documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Egyptian-Media-Mubarak-Denies-Ordering-Police-to-Fire-on-Protesters-125577073.html |title=Egyptian Media: Mubarak Denies Ordering Police to Fire on Protesters &amp;#124; Middle East &amp;#124; English |publisher=Voanews.com |date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mubarak said he issued clear instructions for police not to use force against the protesters. He also denied charges that he ordered or had knowledge of security forces firing on the demonstrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews1&quot;/&gt;

On 16 July, Maj. Gen. Tarek el-Mahdi briefly visited a protest camp in Tahrir Square but left after protesters, some holding shoes in anger, booed him off a stage. He had come to persuade a dozen demonstrators to end a hunger strike which had begun several days ago. El-Mahdi later told state television that he was disappointed that a small crowd of protesters managed to drive him out of the square before he could reach the tent housing the hunger strikers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Deeb |first=Sarah El |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43780050/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/ |title=Senior Egyptian military official heckled&amp;nbsp;â World news&amp;nbsp;â Mideast/N.

He then appointed two new deputies, one of which was prominent economist and former head of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, Hazem el-Biblawi.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

On 17 July, Sharaf named 12 new Cabinet members. State television dubbed the new government lineup the &quot;Revolution Cabinet.&quot; Most of the ministers were newcomers as the government sought to placate further criticism by the protesters. Despite the cabinet reshuffle, many of the protesters said that they had no intention of calling off their week-old sit-in.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=By SARAH EL DEEB, Associated Press |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2011/07/17/international/i085051D98.DTL |title=Egypt military rulers name electoral council head |work=San Francisco Chronicle  |accessdate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the prominent{{Or|date=July 2011}} members of the &quot;Revolution Cabinet&quot; is the Chief of Antiquities [[Zahi Hawass]]. Hawass is a prominant member of Egypts archaeological community, but has been the target of protests himself. These protests were begun by archaeology students who accused him of falsely claiming publicity for himself and corruption.
Sharaf also accepted the resignation of Finance Minister Samir Radwan (the reason for his resignation was because his new budget was deemed by many protestors to be too conservative in dealing with the poverty which had been one of the main catalysts of the uprising) and the foreign minister, who was replaced by the former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Mohammed Kamel Omar. Radwan's position was taken by prominent economist Hazem el-Biblawi, who had also been appointed deputy prime minister. There were also changes in the ministries of transport, military production, higher education, communication, agriculture, health, religious endowments, local development, trade and industry and civil aviation, with ministers being replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate1&quot;/&gt;

On 21 July, the SCAF announced that it would bar foreign monitors in the upcoming [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary election]] because of what it claimed was the preservation of Egyptian sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/07/2011720222415556480.html |title=Egypt not to allow foreign poll monitors&amp;nbsp;â Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in the crowd were thought by protesters to be thugs but some residents of the Abbassiya district were fearful protests in their neighborhood were obstructing business and normalcy. State media said the civilians fighting with the demonstrators were from &quot;people's committees&quot; protecting the neighborhood and the army had maintained all self-restraint, blaming the violence on protesters. Some Abbasiya residents appeared to believe protesters were seeking to create rifts between the army and the people.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;/&gt; Military police, armed with Tasers and batons, fired in the air to stop the demonstrators from approaching the Defense Ministry. A Reuters witness said tear gas fumes were wafting outside the area as military helicopters circled overhead.

On 1 August, the first day of [[Ramadan]], Egyptian soldiers clashed with protesters in Tahrir Square, tearing down tents the activists had used for the sit-in and where hundreds of protesters had been sleeping in the square since 8 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hassieb |first=Ingy |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/egypts-military-police-break-up-tahrir-square-sit-in/2011/08/01/gIQAnvPOnI_story.html |title=Egyptâs military police forcibly break up Tahrir Square sit-in |work=The Washington Post |date= 1 August 2011|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian forces swinging electrified batons and shouting the battle cry &quot;[[Takbir|God is great]]&quot; swiftly chased off dozens of activists who had refused to end four weeks of renewed protests at [[Tahrir Square]] to pressure the countryâs transitional military rulers. Hundreds of riot police backed by armored vehicles and soldiers moved in to tear down the camp of dozens of tents after a group of holdout activists&amp;nbsp;â some of them relatives of people killed in the uprising that toppled [[Hosni Mubarak]] in February&amp;nbsp;â refused pleas over loudspeakers to go home.

The trial of Hosni Mubarak and his two sons Ala'a and Gamal, along with former interior minister [[Habib el-Adly]] and six former top police officials began on 3 August 2011 at a temporary criminal court at the Police Academy in north Cairo.  The charges were corruption and the premediated killing of peaceful protestors during the mass movement to oust him, the latter of which carries the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/06/201161131532286483.html Mubarak and sons to stand trial in August] Al Jazeera. Retrieved 1 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was broadcast on Egyptian television, with Mubarak making a surprise first appearance since his resignation, brought in on a hospital bed and held in a cage for the session. Upon reading out the charges to him, Mubarak pleaded not guilty, denying responsibility for the charges against him. Judge Ahmed Refaat adjourned the court, ruling that Mubarak be transferred under continued arrest to the military hospital on the outskirts of Cairo, with the second session scheduled for 15 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Afify|first=Heba|title=Judge Says TV Will Show Mubarak on Trial|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/world/middleeast/01egypt.html|accessdate=31 July 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 July 2011|author2=Fahim, Kareem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trials of Mubarak and el-Adly were separated after the first session, and a second hearing was held for el-Adly's case on 4 August to release evidence regarding the killings of protesters. After hearing the complaints and requests of the defense lawyers, Judge Refaat proceeded to open numerous boxes of evidence for screening before the lawyers and audience. The evidence included documents of the Central Security Forces, their unit formations and organization, operational police logs and details of orders received and carried out during the protests, a jacket and pants of one of the victims of the protests riddled with bullet holes, guns, spent ammunition casings and grenades used during the protests. At the end of the hearing, Judge Refaat adjourned the trial to 14 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14407595 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;â Egypt al-Adly trial: Gun evidence shown in court |publisher=BBC  |date= 4 August 2011|accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Day2AdlyTrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/483232 |title=Day 2 of Adly trial focuses on evidence presentation &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conduct of individual defense lawyers in both sessions was widely criticized, being somewhat unruly and disorderly, and Judge Refaat demanded at least once during the second hearing that they assume order.&lt;ref name=&quot;Day2AdlyTrial&quot;/&gt; That day, Interior Minister Mansour el-Esawy issued several warnings for police officers not to salute or greet el-Adly and the other accused men, and threatened that he would place the officers under investigation if they did so again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/483643 |title=El-Esawy warns officers not to salute el-Adly and the accused |language=[[Arabic]] |publisher=Almasryalyoum.com |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, 6 August, protesters gathered in Tahrir once again, this time to hold a funeral prayer for one who died during the Abasseya clashes. Around 200 attended, and were prevented from moving to Tahrir Square. Later during the day, a festive [[iftar]] was held in the square by protesters.

On 9 September, tens of thousands of protesters gathered for what they called the &quot;Friday of Correcting the Path&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegypt.com&quot;/&gt; (or the &quot;Correct the Path&quot;) in Suez, Alexandria, Cairo, and other cities, in the absence of supporters of Islamic political movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;sis.gov.eg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Story.aspx?sid=57825 |title=Egypt State Information Service |publisher=Sis.gov.eg |date=10 September 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major demands of the Friday were relieving the [[Mansour el-Essawy]] (''The current [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Minister of the Interior]]''),&lt;ref name=&quot;sis.gov.eg&quot;/&gt; maintaining independence of the judiciary,&lt;ref name=&quot;sis.gov.eg&quot;/&gt; closing the Israeli embassy in Cairo, amending the laws of the People's Assembly and Shura Council&lt;ref name=&quot;sis.gov.eg&quot;/&gt;, and stopping [[Human rights in Egypt under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces#Military trials|military trials for civilians]] that began under the [[SCAF]].

After gathering in Tahrir Square, the protest moved to the [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|MOI]], then to the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt]], and finally towards the Israeli embassy. The 2011 Israeli embassy attack occurred later in Cairo, when Egyptian protesters entered the Israeli embassy after tearing down the wall surrounding the building that housed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/09/20119993150747146.html |title=Egyptians protest against military rule&amp;nbsp;â Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=11 September 2001 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police fired tear gas into the crowds.&lt;ref name=&quot;IsraeliEmbassy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=From Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, For CNN |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/09/09/egypt.protests/index.html |title=Protesters in Egypt breach wall, enter Israeli Embassy&amp;nbsp;â CNN.com |publisher=CNN  |date= 24 August 2011|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said that about 3,000 protesters had torn apart the wall,&lt;ref name=&quot;IsraeliEmbassy&quot;/&gt; forcing the [[EgyptâIsrael relations|Israeli ambassador to Egypt]] to flee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/egypt-on-alert-after-embassy-attack-20110911-1k3pi.html|publisher='Sydney Morning Herald'' | date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military restored a state of emergency; Egyptian activists denounced the political manipulation of doing so.

In November 2011, dissatisfied with the progress of the reforms, almost all civilian political parties called for an accelerated end to the military rule before drafting a constitution&amp;nbsp;â either an immediate handover to a civilian-led government, or a turnover to the lower house of Parliament when it is seated in April, or after a presidential election, which would be scheduled as soon as possible. A major difference between Egyptian revolutionaries is that secular groups want the election to be postponed since they believe that the election would favor religious parties and well established groups like the Muslim Brotherhood while those parties want the parliamentary elections to be held on time. On the other hand they are united in their demand that the military should get out of politics and stop imposing restrictions on the future constitution and allow democratically elected representatives of Egyptians to freely write the new constitution.&lt;ref name=NYT_Nov2011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/world/middleeast/facing-calls-to-give-up-power-egypts-military-battles-crowds.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=igw |title=Egyptâs Civilian Government Submits Offer to Resign |work=New York Times |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=21 November 2011 |first=David D. |last=Kirkpatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence ends brief truce at Egypt protest|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/11/2011112318264965551.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Egypt's constitution being hijacked?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2011/11/2011111891636367639.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters are demanding the SCAF to step down from governing and politics, and hand over the authority to civilians. Other demands include banning former members of [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s regime from running in the next election, and rejection of the military's super-constitution (which restricts the power of the future elected representative in writing the new constitution, gives the military the power to select up to 80 percent of the membership committee that writes the new constitution, and removes the possibility of [[civilian control of the military]] and Egypt's foreign policy which will allow the military to act as a [[state within a state]] in Egypt, a system similar to Turkey's [[Deep State]] before democratic reforms). The protesters state that the situation has not improved during the last 10 months under military government. Media and freedom of expression has become even more restricted, civilian political activists are being tried in military courts for insulting military, human rights situation has not improved, the emergency law (which gives government extra-ordinary powers and the right to ignore laws) continues, and the military junta continues to use the same methods that Mubarak was using. They are also angry at Field Marshal Tantavi's statement announced on TV which implies that military wants to remain involved in politics and will not return to baracks even after presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt: Honeymoon over?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2011/11/201111228212634481.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt: 'Reclaiming the revolution'|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2011/10/201110183346871780.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian military's quandary Losing popular support, or giving in to the demands of the revolution and losing their empire?|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2011/11/2011112363625681613.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 19 November, two people were killed and 600 wounded in violent clashes after mass protests in Tahrir Square against the military junta regime. The protests started in reaction to the military unilaterally announcing a super-constitution that representatives elected for writing the constitution will not be able to change.

Egyptian medics say a police and army assault on anti-government protesters in Cairo has killed at least three people, raising the death toll in Egypt to at least five killed in two days of unrest. Police in Cairo lobbed teargas into crowds of protesters angry at the military governmentâs continued role in political life.  Demonstrators kept control of Tahrir Square Sunday morning, and vowed to keep their revolution alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Police-Protesters-Keep-up-Clashes-in-Cairo-134200628.html |title=Police, Protesters Keep up Clashes in Cairo |publisher=Voanews.com |accessdate=20 November 2011}} Public domain text from the article quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesters demanding faster reforms and establishment of civilian government took to the Tahrir square in Cairo, and also in other cities, and clashed with the security forces. On 21 November 2011, after several days of violent demonstrations in which more than 33 protesters lost their lives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2011/11/22/egyptian_revolution_enters_new_phase_as Egyptian Revolution Enters New Phase] 22 November 2011 [[Democracy Now!]]&lt;/ref&gt; and over 1,500 were wounded, the provisional government offered its resignation to the supreme military council in reaction to the use of force against the protesters.&lt;ref name=NYT_Nov2011 /&gt;

At a crisis meeting on 22 November 2011 between the political and the military leaders, the parties agreed for a new interim government to be formed, and to proceed with the scheduled parliamentary election on 28 November, with a goal of holding a presidential election before the end of June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/Egyptian-Military-Agrees-to-Form-New-Government-134331228.html |title=Egypt to Form New Government, Military to Transfer Power |publisher=Voice of America |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the same day, the US State Department condemned the excessive use of force against the demonstrators by the Egyptian security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/campaigns/us-steps-up-criticism-of-egypts-leaders-says-civilians-must-be-given-power/2011/11/22/gIQAShaulN_story.html |title=US steps up criticism of Egyptâs leaders, says civilians must be given power |work=The Washington Post |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=22 November 2011 |first=Krissah |last=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
