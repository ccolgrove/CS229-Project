'''Libre knowledge''' is knowledge which may be acquired, interpreted and applied freely. It can be re-formulated according to one's needs, and shared with others for community benefit.

The term refers to the cultural movement of [[Libre|free/libre]] knowledge inspired by the principles of [[free software]], the success of [[peer production]] in the development of [[free software]] (and [[Wikipedia]]) and a conviction that knowledge ''should'' be accessible and sharable without restrictions.

==Libre (or free) knowledge==
Advocates of libre knowledge (''[[wiktionary:AKA#Initialism|aka]]'' free knowledge) believe that the freedom of knowledge is under threat on account of attempts to restrict or control sharing of information (or [[explicit knowledge]]) on the Internet. For this reason, a definition of libre knowledge was formulated based on the definition of [[free software]] by the [[Free Software Foundation]] which shares this concern:

:&quot;'''Libre Knowledge''' is [[explicit knowledge]] released in such a way that users are free to read, listen to, watch, or otherwise experience it; to learn from or with it; to copy, adapt and use it for any purpose; and to share derived works similarly (as free knowledge) for the common good.&quot;

Users of libre knowledge are free to

:(0) use the work for any purpose

:(1) study its mechanisms, to be able to modify and adapt it to their own needs

:(2) make and distribute copies, in whole or in part

:(3) enhance and/or extend the work and share the result.

Freedoms 1 and 3 require [[free file format]]s and [[free software]] as defined by the [[Free Software Foundation]]

===Libre resources===
The term &quot;libre resources&quot; refers to resources represented on a device or medium such as files in an open/free format containing text, an image, sound, multimedia, etc. or combinations of these, accessible with free software, and released under a license which grants users the freedom to access, read, listen to, watch, or otherwise experience the resource; to learn with, copy, perform, adapt and use it for any purpose; and to contribute and share enhancements or derived works.

Such resources are central to movements associated with [[free software]], [[Free Culture movement|free culture]], and [[free knowledge]], etc., and are used by [[libre communities]] - for example, for learning (see [[libre learning]] below).

The [[libre manifesto]] indicates some of the values behind such movements.

Use of the term &quot;libre resources&quot; emerged from discussions of free/libre knowledge as a generalisation.

===Libre learning===
Knowledge and learning go hand-in hand. Libre Learning is (potentially collaborative, social constructionist learning) unfettered by overly restrictive licenses using [[libre resources]]. The term is associated with visions such as &quot;freedom to learn&quot; - liberating education and learning - deemed appropriate in countries where the public educational systems are not able to meet all the needs, encouraging and enabling civil society to take the initiative and augment the public education systems.

==Historical notes and references==
It may be argued{{By whom|date=October 2010}} that the concepts of free/libre knowledge and non-free knowledge have been around ever since humans have been capable of communicating. Academic discourse on these concepts is not new, though in recent years the debate has become particularly heated with the advent of the Internet and the ease with which knowledge may be shared.

Some of the discussions leading to the emergence of the ideas of &quot;libre resources&quot; (above) and [[libre communities]] occurred during workshops in a project originally called &quot;Free Knowledge Communities&quot;, and later [http://www.libre.org/communities Libre Communities].

The primary concern was the need to provide access to learning resources for the developed world - resources which would inevitably need to be recontextualised and adapted for local use. It would also be beneficial if the recipients of such resources are free to adapt and distribute derived works without restriction.

The intent is to encourage people concerned with open content (etc.) to distinguish &quot;open&quot; from &quot;free/libre&quot;, to understand [[Copyleft]], and to license resources accordingly, to enable a &quot;copy-modify, mix and share&quot; (free or &quot;read-write&quot;) culture and society.

Discussions along these lines may be found in (for example) the forums and at conferences of the [[Open educational resources]] communities, discussions about [[Free software]] and [[free culture]].

These are likely to continue as the [[GNU General Public License]] and [[Creative Commons licenses]] evolve in response to contemporary issues associated with the freedom of users.
