'''Highway 97C''', the '''Okanagan Connector''' or '''Coquihalla Connector''', forms part of an important link between the [[Lower Mainland]] and the Okanagan Valley around [[Kelowna, British Columbia|Kelowna]].  It bisects the [[British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway]] at [[Merritt, British Columbia|Merritt]].  Highway 97C is a relatively new route, commissioned in 1990.

== Route description ==

Highway 97C, which is 220&amp;nbsp;km (137&amp;nbsp;mi) in total length, was constructed as the third phase of the Coquihalla Highway Project.  Construction was completed in 1990, with the cost totalling to $225 million in 1987 dollars ($373 million inflation adjusted 2009 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/frontiertofreeway/frontiertofreeway.pdf|title=Frontier to Freeway -
A Short Illustrated History of Roads in British Columbia|author=B.C. Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure|accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The route begins near [[Trepanier, British Columbia|Trepanier]], at a location on [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] known as Drought Hill.  The section of Highway 97C east of Merritt is mostly freeway, with a speed limit of 110&amp;nbsp;km/h (68&amp;nbsp;mph) and between 4 and 6 lanes, and has very few exits along its route.  Its highest altitude is the [[Pennask Summit]] (1728 m, 5760&amp;nbsp;ft, above sea level).  Highway 97C travels on this freeway 82&amp;nbsp;km (51&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest to [[Aspen Grove, British Columbia|Aspen Grove]], where it converges with [[British Columbia Highway 5A|Highway 5A]].  This stretch is a four-lane rural arterial highway. Highways 97C and 5A share the 28&amp;nbsp;km (17&amp;nbsp;mi) long route between Aspen Grove and [[Lower Nicola, British Columbia|Lower Nicola]], where Highway 5A diverges immediately east and [[British Columbia Highway 8|Highway 8]] begins. 97C was originally intended to have a freeway connection with the [[British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway 5]], but this was protested by local residents in Merritt on the grounds that it would take tourists away from the area, and so the freeway remains incomplete to this day.  In July 2007, the shared roadway of Highway 5A and 97C was upgraded to a 2 lane road in each direction, the last segment required to enable 2 lanes in each direction when traveling between Vancouver and Kelowna.  

North of the Highway 8 junction, Highway 97C goes north for 42&amp;nbsp;km (26&amp;nbsp;mi) to [[Logan Lake, British Columbia|Logan Lake]], then northwest for 57&amp;nbsp;km (35&amp;nbsp;mi) to [[Ashcroft, British Columbia|Ashcroft]] on the [[Canadian National Railway]].  Highway 97C then travels 6&amp;nbsp;km (4&amp;nbsp;mi) west from Ashcroft to where it converges with [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]], which takes Highway 97C north for its final 5&amp;nbsp;km (3&amp;nbsp;mi) to its end at Highway 97 in [[Cache Creek, British Columbia|Cache Creek]].
