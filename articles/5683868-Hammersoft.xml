The '''Deep South's Oldest Rivalry''' is an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played by the [[Auburn Tigers football]] team of [[Auburn University]] and the [[Georgia Bulldogs football]] team of the [[University of Georgia]].  The football teams of the two universities first played each other on February 20, 1892 at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], with Auburn winning 10&amp;ndash;0.

== Series history ==

The first Auburn&amp;ndash;Georgia football game was played on February 20, 1892 in Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghosts&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ghosts of Herty Field:Early Days on a Southern Gridiron|first=John F.|last=Stegeman|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|date=2007|isbn=0820319597|pages=8â14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was the brainchild of [[Charles Herty]] of Georgia and [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]] of Auburn, both trainers at their respective schools and graduate school classmates at [[The Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ghosts&quot; /&gt;  The game was also, according to legend, when Auburn's team cheer, &quot;[[War Eagle]],&quot; originated.

The Tigers and Bulldogs have played each other every year since 1898 with only three exceptions when [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] interrupted the series.  Through the 2011 season, the rivalry is tied for the seventh most played college football series at 115 games, and is among the most evenly matched, with Auburn holding a 54&amp;ndash;53&amp;ndash;8 overall lead in the series.  When the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) split into its Eastern Division and Western Division in 1992, with Auburn placed in the west and Georgia in the east, the game was designated as the teams' annual cross-divisional rivalry game.

== Game results ==

''Auburn victories are colored &lt;font color=&quot;#03244d&quot;&gt;ââ&lt;/font&gt; navy blue.  Georgia victories are colored &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;ââ&lt;/font&gt; red.  Ties are white.''

== Notable games ==
In 1942, Georgia won the national championship with an 11-1 record, beating [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] in the [[1943 Rose Bowl]]. But Georgia didn't beat Auburn, falling 27-13 at [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]'s [[A. J. McClung Memorial Stadium|Memorial Stadium]].

On November 14, 1959, at [[Sanford Stadium]] in Athens, as time ran short, Georgia player and future Auburn head-coach [[Pat Dye]] recovered a fumble by Auburn quarterback Bryant Harvard. Georgia quarterback [[Fran Tarkenton|Fran Tarkenton's]] touchdown pass in the final seconds gave Georgia a 14-13 victory and cost Auburn a Southeastern Conference championship. Georgia went on to claim the 1959 SEC Championship and the 1960 Orange Bowl Championship with a victory over Missouri in Miami.

The AU-UGA game has been held in many different cities - Atlanta, Athens, [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], Columbus, [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] - but on November 12, 1960, the Bulldogs made their first trip to the [[Auburn, Alabama|Loveliest Village on the Plains]]; a game which the Tigers won 9-6. This marked a huge change for the Tigers, as Auburn's biggest rivals - [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]], [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]], [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] and Georgia - previously would not travel to Auburn. Georgia Tech's first visit came in 1970, while Tennessee eventually came in 1974. It would take Auburn's biggest rival, Alabama, almost 30 years after UGA to make the trip.

In 1983, again at Sanford Stadium, [[Pat Dye]] celebrated his first SEC championship as Auburn's coach after the Tigers beat Georgia 13-7 on November 12. Georgia coach [[Vince Dooley]], a former star Auburn quarterback, was there too on that day in 1959 as an assistant on [[Ralph Jordan|Shug Jordan's]] staff.

In 1986, the Bulldogs visited Auburn as three-touchdown underdogs. Auburn was two wins away from the SEC Championship, with only one blemish on their record, an 18-17 setback at Florida. Georgia, playing its backup quarterback, escaped with a 20-16 victory. When Georgia fans stormed the field of [[Jordan-Hare Stadium]] and refused to leave, they were doused by sprinkler system and fire hoses. Auburn received a hefty bill from UGA for water damage to band instruments.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1994, a Georgia team that had lost to [[Vanderbilt Commodores|Vanderbilt]] and had been blown out 52-14 by [[Florida Gators football|Florida]], ended Auburn and former coach [[Terry Bowden]]'s 20-game winning streak with a 23-23 tie at Jordan-Hare. The Sunday morning headline in nearby Columbus, Ga read &quot;UGA beats Auburn 23-23&quot;.

In 1996, the two teams played in the first Southeastern Conference football game to go into overtime. First-year head coach [[Jim Donnan]]'s team, which finished 5-6, was down 28-7 at halftime, before rallying to tie it at 28-28 on a 30 yard touchdown as time expired from Mike Bobo to Cory Allen, and Georgia went on to win 56-49 in four overtimes.  This game, known to Georgia fans as the &quot;Miracle on the Plains,&quot; was also famous for the incident in which [[Uga (mascot)|Uga V]] lunged at Auburn wide receiver [[Robert Baker (football player)|Robert Baker]] after a first quarter touchdown.

In 1999, Auburn coach [[Tommy Tuberville]] got his first signature win, as the underdog Tigers, losers of five of their previous six games, led 31-0 at halftime and cruised to a 38-21 victory.

In 2002, #7 Georgia traveled to #22 Auburn with a spot in the SEC Championship game and an outside chance at the national title on the line.  Auburn led 14-3 at halftime, thanks to a 53 yard touchdown run from Ronnie Brown.  Georgia rallied to make it 21-17 Tigers with 1:25 remaining when they faced a 4th and 15 from the Auburn 19.  QB David Greene threw up a prayer, and Michael Johnson outjumped Auburn CB Horace Willis to come away with the improbable touchdown.  Georgia defeated Auburn 24-21 to secure a spot in their first SEC Championship Game. The Bulldogs defeated Arkansas 30-3 to win their first SEC Championship since 1982.  The Bulldogs finished the season 13-1 with a victory over [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] in the Sugar Bowl, and a #3 final ranking.

Eighth-ranked Georgia traveled to undefeated and third-ranked [[2004 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn in 2004]].  The Tigers were eyeing their first SEC Championship since splitting the title in 1989 (note: Auburn was on probation in 1993 and ineligible for the championship), as well as a spot in the BCS National Championship Game.  The Tigers won 24-6 on their way to a 13-0 season, ending with a 16-13 victory over [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] in the [[Sugar Bowl]] and a No. 2 national ranking.

In 2006, Georgia visited Auburn having lost four of their previous five games and being unranked for the first time since 2002, while fifth-ranked Auburn had national title hopes. Georgia had lost to Vanderbilt and [[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] in the same season for the first time since 1973, when they rebounded to defeat Auburn.  History repeated itself as the Bulldogs defeated the Tigers 37-15 and ended Auburn's chances at a national title.

2007 marked the first time in the modern era that Georgia wore black jerseys. It also marked the first time that Georgia defeated Florida and Auburn in the same season since 1982[http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/111107/football_20071111097.shtml], and the first time that Georgia scored more than 40 points in three straight games since 1942.

== Family rivalry ==
{{Quotation|It's a unique thing.  It's like playing against your brother. I don't think anybody who plays in that game can ever forget it.  It just doesn't matter much where it's played or what somebody's record is.  It's so intense and tough, but at the same time, it's family.|Pat Dye, UGA '60 - Auburn head coach, 1981-1992}}

Beyond the length of the rivalry, the schools' football histories are quite interconnected. Georgia's long-time head coach and athletic director, [[Vince Dooley]], earned both his bachelor's and master's degree at Auburn while playing football and subsequently beginning his coaching career under legendary Auburn head coach [[Shug Jordan]].  Jordan himself was an assistant football coach and head basketball coach at Georgia before returning to his alma mater.

Former Auburn head coach [[Pat Dye]] was a three-year letterman and All-American offensive lineman at Georgia under head coach [[Wally Butts]].  Both, current Georgia defensive line coach Rodney Garner and former offensive line coach Stacy Searels, played at Auburn under Dye.  Former Auburn defensive coordinator [[Will Muschamp]] and offensive line coach Hugh Nall are former Georgia players. Former Georgia offensive coordinator [[Neil Callaway]] was Auburn's offensive line coach for all of Dye's 12 seasons.  In the coaching search that brought Dye to Auburn, Vince Dooley was first contacted about the position but decided to remain at Georgia.

{{Quotation|Both programs, in my opinion, have cut their teeth on the same values. The leadership in this program and at Georgia has been very similar.|Will Muschamp, UGA '94, AU '96, Auburn defensive coordinator, 2006-2007}}

{{Quotation|I think this is what you would call a friendly rivalry. Both places are good schools, good places. Both of them have good people. That's what makes it special.|Neil Callaway, Georgia offensive coordinator, 2000-2006}}
