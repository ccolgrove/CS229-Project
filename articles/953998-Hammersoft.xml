The History of Easy Mix dates as far back as the 1960s when a company called ''Radio International'' started '''Radio i''' in Auckland. The station started originally leasing air time on [[ZM (New Zealand)|1ZM]] as at this point the NZBC had a monopoly on the New Zealand airwaves preventing private broadcasters from operating. Radio i was granted a broadcasting licence in 1970, the same year [[Radio Hauraki]] was granted the very first private commercial licence in New Zealand, Radio i originally broadcast on 1590AM in the Auckland region and moved to 1330AM in 1978 and later that year to 1332AM. When the station switched to FM in 1990 the name was changed to '''Radio i92FM''' broadcasting on 91.8FM. After 3 months on the air on 91.8FM the station moved to its current frequency on 98.2FM and became '''Radio i98FM''' and later '''Easy Listening i98FM'''. Easy Listening  had several changes of ownership and in 1996 Easy Listening i in Auckland was sold to [[The Radio Network]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theradiovault.net/auckland.htm The Radio Vault - Auckland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Easy Listening began broadcasting in [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] in 1993 when local station [[Easy Listening 97FM]] was rebranded as '''Easy Listening i97FM''' with the station remaining local until 1995 when programming was replaced with Auckland based programming. In 1996 the station was sold to [[The Radio Network]] and at the time in Hamilton the station reverted back to local programming but the format of the station mirrored that of Easy Listening i98FM in Auckland. In 1999 Easy Listening  was dropped from the Waikato market and replaced with [[Newstalk ZB]] on this frequency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theradiovault.net/hamilton.htm The Radio Vault - Hamilton]&lt;/ref&gt;

Easy Listening was started in [[Hawkes Bay]] in 1996 when [[The Alligator 90-100 FM|The New Alligator 99-100FM]] was rebranded as '''Easy Listening i90FM''' broadcasting on 90.3FM and 99.9FM, this station was operated as part of a franchise agreement. The station was originally local but shortly after being rebranded local programming was replaced with Auckland based programming. The stations was taken over by the [[Hawkes Bay Media Group]] during the middle of 1996 and the 99.9FM frequency was used to start local station [[Xtreme 100]]. At the end of 1997 the station reverted back to local programming ceased using the ''Easy Listening i'' name and became ''Easy Listening 90FM'' and in 1999 was renamed again to [[90.3 Cool FM]]. In 2000 ''Independent Radio'' (formally Hawkes Bay Media Group) was sold to [[The Radio Network]] and the station reverted to '''Easy Listening i90.3FM''' but now networked from Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theradiovault.net/napier_hastings.htm The Radio Vault - Napier/Hastings]&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 2011, the Hawke's Bay station was closed down, and the frequency switched to [[Newstalk ZB]].

Easy Listening launched in Rotorua in late 1996 as ''Easy Listening i94.3FM'' and operated as part of a franchise agreement with local Rotorua station [[Triple X 99FM]]. The station featured a local breakfast show but outside breakfast programming was networked from Auckland.  The station closed down in 1998 but The Radio Network brought Easy Listening i back to Rotorua in 2004 as ''Easy Listening i95.1FM'' with all programming now networked from Auckland. On March 31st 2010 The Radio Network sold the 95.1FM frequency and as a result Easy Mix went off the air in Rotorua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theradiovault.net/rotorua.htm The Radio Vault - Rotorua]&lt;/ref&gt;

Easy Listening began broadcasting in Tauranga in 2000 as ''Easy Listening i99FM'' with all programming networked from Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theradiovault.net/tauranga.htm The Radio Vault - Tauranga]&lt;/ref&gt;

Easy Listening also broadcast into Christchuch on 94.5FM (during the mid-nineties) as a completely local station, this station was operated by [[C93FM|C93FM Limited]] and was rebranded as [[Lite FM]] in 1998 after C93FM Limited was sold to [[Radio Otago]], today this station has once again been rebranded as [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]].
Easy Listening made a return to Christchurch in 2003 now broadcasting on 1593AM and now as the network based product instead of their own local product, the station also was networked into Dunedin in 2003 on 954AM. Both stations did not perform well and as a result were replaced with [[Coast (New Zealand radio)|Coast]] in 2004.

The Easy Listening network was rebranded as Viva FM in 2005, and subsequently rebranded in August 2007 as Easy Mix. In 2008 Easy Mix began broadcasting in [[Wellington]] networked from Auckland on 93.5FM.
