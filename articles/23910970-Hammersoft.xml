'''Disney Channel Spain''' is a [[free-to-air]] [[television channel]] and is an edition of the [[The Walt Disney Company]]-owned [[Disney Channel]], broadcasting in [[Spain]]. It is marketed to mostly children; however, in recent years the diversity of viewers has increased with an older audience. It is owned by ''Disney-ABC Cable Networks Group.'' which is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. It began broadcasting in [[1998]] as a [[satellite television]] channel. On July 1, 2008, it replaced the channel [[Fly Music]] on the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[digital terrestrial television]], thus becoming the first [[Disney Channel (international)|Disney Channel]] available in open television, that is disney channel in Spain is free.

A 1 hour [[timeshift channel]] called ''Disney Channel +1'' is available on some [[satellite television]] services. It has three sister channels, [[Playhouse_Disney_around_the_world#Spain|Playhouse Disney Channel]], [[Disney XD (Spain)|Disney XD]] and [[Disney Cinemagic]].

==History==
Disney Channel Spain was born in 1998, when [[The Walt Disney Company]] and [[Sogecable]] came to an agreement to distribute a version in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] of the American &quot;[[Disney Channel]]&quot; on the satellite platform [[Canal Satellite Digital]]. The channel began broadcasting on April 17, 1998.

For the launch of the channel was used, in addition to the file [[cartoon]] series and [[film]] Disney-produced programs that bring the channel to the Spanish public. Spaces were made as well [[Art Attack]], Spanish version of the American program by [[Jordi Cruz]] among others.

3 years after the diversified supply channel in the same satellite platform, and offers 3 channels: an [[timeshift]] called ''Disney Channel +1'', [[Toon Disney]] and [[Playhouse Disney]]''. The first issue is devoted exclusively to animation of Disney, while the second is a channel for preschool children and with special schedules. In 2008, Toon Disney became [[Disney Cinemagic]].

===Issues in Digital Terrestrial Television===
In February 2008 the Disney company decided to buy 20% stake in the group of [[digital terrestrial television]] [[Net TV]], and the contract involved the possibility of exploiting one of the 2 licenses for the company's current DTT.

Finally, the company announced in late May 2008 the launch of Disney Channel as an open channel from July the 1st, 2008 under the provision of DTT. This way, the frequency where [[Fly Music]], a channel that was managed by [[Europroducciones]], was broadcasting, was assigned to Disney Channel. The director of the chain at that time, Jose Vila, confirmed that the schedule would be similar to the time the channel was [[pay per view]], but increasing advertising to cover costs. The launch includes an advertising campaign under the slogan ''Disney Channel, at last for everybody''.

With this announcement, Disney Channel Spain became the first [[Disney Channel]] in the world completely open and free.

Starting on 1 May 2010 Disney Channel Spain started [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] broadcasting.

Disney Channel will launch their new International Logo in 20 june 2011.

==Programming==
Series produced by [[Walt Disney Television Animation]] and [[Disney Channel Original Series]] takes most of the schedule.
