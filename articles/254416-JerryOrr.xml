The '''St. Paul Saints''' are a professional baseball team based in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], in the [[United States]]. The Saints are a member of the North Division of the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball]], which is not affiliated with [[Major League Baseball]]. The Saints have played their home games at [[Midway Stadium]] since 1993, when the modern-day team started as a member of the [[Northern League (baseball, 1993â2010)|Northern League]]. In 2006 the team was a founding member of the modern [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball|American Association]].

Before the arrival of the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1961, there was a long history of [[minor-league baseball]] teams called the St. Paul Saints, as well as their crosstown rivals the [[Minneapolis Millers]].  [[St. Paul Saints (UA)|One incarnation]] of the Saints participated in the [[Union Association]], a short-lived major league, in 1884.  A [[#St. Paul Saints (1894-1899)|second incarnation]] was active in the [[Western League (original)|Western League]] from 1894 to 1899, and became a forerunner of the modern [[Chicago White Sox]].  The [[#St. Paul Saints (1915-1960)|third and most long-lived incarnation]] of the Saints was active in the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] from 1915 to 1960.

== History ==
The current inception of the St. Paul Saints was formed in 1993 in the [[Northern League (baseball, 1993â2010)|Northern League]], one of several independent leagues not affiliated with Major League Baseball. The Saints are known for promotions that are sometimes over-the-top even by the standards of minor league baseball. In this regard, Mike Veeck, formerly the team's principal owner and still owner of a large interest in the team, is seen as following in the footsteps of his father [[Bill Veeck]], who was famous for conceiving outlandish promotions as an owner of the Major League teams the [[Baltimore Orioles#St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]], [[Cleveland Indians]], and [[Chicago White Sox]].  The current majority owner, [[Marvin Goldklang]], also owns a stake in four other minor league baseball teams: the [[Fort Myers Miracle]], [[Sioux Falls Fighting Pheasants|Sioux Falls Pheasants]], [[Hudson Valley Renegades]], and [[Charleston RiverDogs]].  Comedian and actor [[Bill Murray]] is also a part owner.

Despite the considerable naysaying at their inception, the Saints became one of the most successful teams in the Northern League and all of independent baseball.  In 2002-2004, the Saints saw severely reduced attendance, owing partially to renewed interest in the [[Minnesota Twins]] of Major League Baseball, who won the 2002, 2003, and 2004 [[American League]] Central Division championships. In spite of an initially cool, if not outright hostile reception, the Saints and their Major League neighbor (less than 10 miles away) have worked together for several years to promote the sport of baseball.

The Saints have figured prominently in the creation of modern independent baseball. The team has been featured in books (&quot;Rebel Baseball&quot; by Steve Perlstein, 1993; &quot;Slouching Toward Fargo&quot; by Neal Karlen, 1998) and a cable network series (&quot;[[Baseball, Minnesota]]&quot;, [[FX Network]], 1996â97). Mike Veeck wrote a book that covered the mantra &quot;Fun is Good&quot; (2005) and describes the business approach he has used for many years. 

[[Image:Saintspig.jpg|left|thumb|250px|In a tradition started in the team's first year, the Saints pig brings out game balls and receives a snack between innings.]]

On September 29, 2005, the Saints left the Northern League, along with the [[Lincoln Saltdogs]], [[Sioux City Explorers]], and the [[Sioux Falls Fighting Pheasants|Sioux Falls Pheasants]] to start the [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball|American Association]] for the 2006 season.

In June 2009 the Saints began a push to build a new stadium in Downtown Saint Paul. The proposed 7,500 seat stadium would be located in the Lowertown neighborhood near a planned maintenance facility for the [[Central Corridor (Minnesota)|Central Corridor]] light rail line.  While baseball stadiums are usually designed to face east so batters don't have to stare into the evening sun, the new stadium is currently designed to face southwest, relying on downtown skyscrapers to shield the batters' eyes. The city of Saint Paul requested $25 million dollars in its 2010 bonding wish list to the Minnesota Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Havens, Chris (June 26, 2009) [http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/49278912.html?elr=KArks:DCiUHc3E7_V_nDaycUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU &quot;Wish list: New home for Saints&quot;] ''[[Star Tribune]]''.

===St. Paul Saints (1894-1899)===
As described in Lee Allen's book, ''The American League Story'' (Putnam, 1962), the team began as the Sioux City franchise in a minor league called the Western League. The WL had reorganized itself in November, 1893, with [[Ban Johnson]] as President. Johnson, a Cincinnati-based reporter, had been recommended by his friend [[Charles Comiskey]], former major league star with the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Browns]] in the 1880s, who was then managing the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. After the 1894 season, when Comiskey's contract with the Reds was up, he decided to take his chances at ownership. He bought the Sioux City team and transferred it to St. Paul, where it enjoyed some success over the next 5 seasons.

In 1900, the Western League changed its name to the American League. It was still officially a minor league, a part of the National Agreement and an underling of the National League. The NL actually gave permission to the AL to put a team in Chicago, and on March 21, 1900, Comiskey moved his St. Paul club to the South Side, where they became the [[Chicago White Sox]].

[[Image:Joe Riggert.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Joe Riggert]] accumulated 1,639 hits over 12 seasons with the old Saints.]]

===St. Paul Saints (1915-1960)===
Another team called the Saints played minor league baseball in the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] from 1915 to 1960.  The Saints finished first in the American Association nine times, and won the [[Little World Series]] in 1924.  During this period, the Saints were a farm club of the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1936â1942), the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1944â1957), and the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (1958â1960). The Saints played streetcar home and away double headers with their local rivals, the [[Minneapolis Millers]]. When the [[Minnesota Twins]] came to town in 1961, the Saints became the [[Omaha Dodgers]] and the Millers went out of existence. [[Lexington Park]] served as the Saints' home stadium for most of those years.

==Notable promotions==
In an attempt to gain publicity in a metropolitan area that hosts four major pro sports teams and a [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|major college program]], the Saints have grabbed headlines numerous times for their unique promotions.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web

*The Saints announced a giveaway for their May 23, 2009 game against the [[Sioux Falls Fighting Pheasants|Sioux Falls Pheasants]] of 2,500 bobblehead dolls dressed as the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' character [[Count von Count]], supposedly celebrating the 40th anniversary of the series. The Saints' version of this doll, however, has the face of [[Al Franken]] on one side and [[Norm Coleman]] on the other and is named &quot;Count von [[Election recount|Re-Count]]&quot;âreferring to the prolonged recount in the [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008|2008 U.S. Senate election]] between the two men. The Saints made further jabs at the race:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=4201396 |title=Saints' gimmick jabs at Senate race |author=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2009-05-23 |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by [[Dean Barkley]], who ran in that election as a [[Independence Party of Minnesota|third-party]] candidate.
** Fans were asked during the game to spin the heads of their dolls to either Coleman or Franken. Attorneys were present to count the &quot;votes&quot; from this process, a jab at the extensive involvement of attorneys in the recount process. The team's official web site stated that fans could challenge the &quot;results&quot; at the team's Fan Services booth during the game.
** The team also facetiously stated on its site that it would not make the results of that night's game official until mid-Juneâaround the time that the [[en banc|entire]] [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] was scheduled to rule on Coleman's appeal of a panel ruling that Franken had won. (The Court issued its ruling in Franken's favor on June 30, with Coleman then conceding.)
*In May, 2008, the Saints announced the giveaway of 2,500 bobble foot dolls, ostensibly to celebrate National Tap Dance Day. The dolls, which feature two feet visible beneath the door of a bathroom stall, have been covered in the national news for their reference to Senator [[Larry Craig]], notorious for soliciting sex in a [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis-Saint Paul Airport]] restroom in August 2007.&lt;ref name=craig-toy&gt;{{cite news

*In August, 2007, the Saints announced that rubber dog toys would be given out as a jab to the [[Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation|federal dogfighting case]] involving [[Atlanta Falcons]] [[quarterback]] [[Michael Vick]].&lt;ref name=vick-toy&gt;{{cite web

*In April 2006, the Saints announced that rubber boats would be given out during a May 27, 2006 game, ostensibly to honor the 30th anniversary of the television show ''[[The Love Boat]]''. However, details of the promotion indicate that it was intended as a jab at the [[Minnesota Vikings boat party scandal|2005 boat scandal]] involving the [[Minnesota Vikings]], where several members of the team were allegedly involved in illicit behavior on a private cruise. The promotional rubber boats used the same color as the Vikings uniforms (purple and yellow) and were named ''Minnetonka Queen'' (a reference to [[Lake Minnetonka]], where the cruise took place).&lt;ref name=espn /&gt;
*In August 2004, the Saints held a Bobblehead Election to tap into the campaign buzz around the election year. Fans were told to select either a John Kerry or George Bush bobblehead as their &quot;vote.&quot; The stunt was capped off with a speech by the winning bobblehead. A real donkey and a donkey dressed like an elephant (the Saints were unable to obtain a real elephant) added to the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bobble--heads.com/bobbleheads/bobbleheads-election.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*In August 2003, the Saints held &quot;Randy Moss Hood Ornament Night&quot;, poking fun at [[Randy Moss]], then a wide receiver for the Vikings. Earlier that year, Moss was involved in an incident where he bumped a traffic control officer with his car while he attempted to make a turn.&lt;ref name=espn /&gt;
*During the 2002 [[Major League Baseball]] labor negotiations, the Saints gave away seat cushions with pictures of commissioner [[Bud Selig]] on one side and [[Major League Baseball Players Association|player's association]] Executive Director [[Donald Fehr]] on the other.&lt;ref name=espn /&gt;
*In 2002, in response to Selig's controversial decision to end the [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|MLB All-Star Game]] in a 7-7 tie, the Saints gave out [[neckties]] (or &quot;ties&quot;) with Bud Selig's image.&lt;ref name=espn /&gt;
