[[File:PSG fÃ©minines CFF 2010.jpg|thumb|220px|right|&quot;Les Parisiennes&quot; lift the [[2009â10 Challenge de France|French Cup]] title.]]
The first record of a Paris Saint-Germain female side can be traced back to 1971. The club had licensed a few women before the 1971â72 season but there wasn't a women's football section or even a team.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris St-Germain'', NÂ°1 de septembre 1971, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  33 women were licensed by the club and a senior female team was registered in the [[:fr:Ligue de Paris Ãle-de-France de football|Division d'Honneur de Paris]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Football Club'', NÂ°8 de juin 1972, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Camp des Loges]] hosted the so-called Â« big match to promote women's football Â» on 21 January 1979. It was contested by the [[Stade de Reims]] Ladies, 1978 Women's World Invitation Tournament champions in [[Taiwan]], and a team composed of Parisian players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

PSG Ladies, as the official female section of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], was founded in 1991. Therefore, the club does not recognize the history, titles and statistics before 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;pfem&quot;/&gt; Casually, that same year the French Football Federation decided to change the competition format of the Division 1 FÃ©minine for the following season. Since 1974, the league consisted of several groups with the winners of each group entering a playoff phase to determine the champion. The 1991â92 season was the last one with that format. A new rule was created, however, to make way for the new competition format being set up for the 1992â93 season and onwards. The Division 1 had 30 clubs spread in three groups with 10 clubs each. The new format, however, consisted of 12 clubs in a single group. In order to eliminate the remaining 18 clubs, the four highest placed teams from each group would stay in the Division 1 FÃ©minine while the six lowest placed teams from each group would be relegated to the [[:fr:Championnat de France de football fÃ©minin D2|Division 2 FÃ©minine]]. The newly formed PSG Ladies suddenly found themselves in Division 2 after finishing fifth just one point behind the fourth spot, synonymous with top-flight status for the 1992â93 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;ladies&quot;/&gt;

PSG garnered only 6 points after recording 2 victories, 2 draws and 18 defeats. Six years later, Paris Saint-Germain won the Division 2, the club's first trophy, and were promoted to the top-flight in 2001. Since then Paris has never been relegated from the Division 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;ladies&quot;/&gt; PSG continued without major problems among the elite but never within the top clubs under coach Cyril Combettes. The best players in the club at the time were [[BÃ©rangÃ¨re Sapowicz]], [[Laure Boulleau]], [[:fr:Nonna Debonne|Nonna Debonne]] and [[Sabrina Delannoy]]. Cyril Combettes resigned due to relationship problems with the players and was replaced by Ãric Leroy in 2007. He guided PSG to the [[:fr:Challenge de France fÃ©minin 2007-2008|French Cup Final]] against [[Olympique Lyonnais (ladies)|Olympique Lyonnais]] at the [[Stade de France]] in 2008. PSG conceded three goals after having withstood the French champion in the first half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Stadia==
{{Main|Camp des Loges}}
The [[Camp des Loges]] is the training center and club headquarters of Paris Saint-Germain. Following the foundation of Paris Saint-Germain in 1974, the Camp des Loges began operating as a training center for the club. The PSG training center officially opened on 4 November 1975 with Pedro Alonso being installed as the club's first director. On 15 March 2006, in order to modernize the center, Paris Saint-Germain announced that the club would temporarily vacate the Camp des Loges in order for the facilities to be renovated. The renovations officially started in January 2008 and were completed on 4 October 2008. The entire process cost â¬5m. The new Camp des Loges, located 400 meters from the old, was inaugurated on 4 November 2008. The center hosts training sessions for the senior team and serves as the home facility for the club's [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Reserves and Academy|Reserves and Academy]] sides (both male and female), which both play their home matches at the Stade Georges LefÃ¨vre.&lt;ref name=&quot;pfem&quot;/&gt;

==Current squad==
French teams are limited to three players without [[European Union|EU]] citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the [[ACP countries]]âcountries in Africa, the [[Caribbean]], and the [[Oceania|Pacific]] that are signatories to the [[Cotonou Agreement]]âare not counted against non-EU quotas due to the [[Kolpak ruling]].
