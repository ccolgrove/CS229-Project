The '''Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games''' ('''VANOC''') ({{lang-fr|ComitÃ© dâorganisation des Jeux olympiques et paralympiques dâhiver de 2010 Ã  Vancouver - COVAN}}) was the [[non-profit organization]] responsible for planning, organizing, financing and staging the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] and [[2010 Winter Paralympics]].  Established on September 30, 2003, about four months after the [[Bids for the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games were awarded]] to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], it performed these roles with &quot;the mandate to support and promote the development of [[sport in Canada]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=About VANOC | url= http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/about-vanoc/organizing-committee/ | publisher=Official VANOC website| accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VANOC was led by [[chief executive officer]] [[John Furlong (Canadian)|John Furlong]], an [[Irish Canadian|Irish-born]] long-time member of the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= John Furlong - Chief Executive Officer| url= http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/about-vanoc/organizing-committee/management-team/john-furlong/john-furlong_88274Zn.html | publisher=Official VANOC website| accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[board of directors]] consisted of 20 members, with seven chosen by the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]], one from the [[Canadian Paralympic Committee]], three each from [[Government of Canada|Canadian]]  and [[Politics of British Columbia|British Columbian provincial]] governments, two from the City government of Vancouver, two from the [[Resort Municipality of Whistler]], one chosen jointly by the Band Councils of the [[Lil'wat First Nation|Lil'wat]] and [[Sá¸µwxÌ±wÃº7mesh]] Nations, and a final director chosen by the other 19 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Board of Directors| url= http://www.vancouver2010.com/paralympic-games/more-2010-information/about-vanoc/organizing-committee/board-of-directors/ | publisher=Official VANOC website| accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
On January 30, 2009, VANOC announced its updated budget for the 2010 games.  The [[operating budget]] was set at CAN$1.76 billion, with a contingency of $77 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;budget09&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title= VANOC releases updated balanced budget for 2010 Winter Games| url= http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/vanoc-releases-updated-balanced-budget-for-2010-winter-games_62856Hz.html| publisher=Official VANOC website| date=January 30, 2009| accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflected an increase of $130 million over the $1.63 billion operating budget announced in May 2007, though VANOC said that if the accounting principles applied for the 2009 budget were retroactively applied to the May 2007 budget, the operating budget would have remained &quot;relatively unchanged.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;budget09&quot;/&gt;  The VANOC operating budget was financed by [[private sector]] sources such as sponsorships,  licensing, merchandising, ticket sales and fundraising, as well as with a contribution from the [[International Olympic Committee]]; it was separate from the CAN$580 million spent on venue construction, costs for which were shared equally by the [[government of Canada]] and the [[Politics of British Columbia|provincial government of British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;budget09&quot;/&gt;

One of VANOCâs goals was to achieve &quot;unprecedented&quot;  [[First Nations]], [[Inuit]], and [[MÃ©tis people (Canada)|MÃ©tis]] participation in the planning and hosting of the 2010 Winter Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Aboriginal Participation | url= http://www.vancouver2010.com/aboriginal-participation/ | publisher=Official VANOC website| accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VANOC also sought to place a broader emphasis on [[sustainability]], integrating it into purchasing and daily operations and expanding to include &quot;social and economic dimensions&quot; , such as an effort to include &quot;inner-city residents and businesses in the economic opportunities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Raising the Bar with VANOCâs Sustainability Initiatives | url= http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/sustainability/sustainability-stories/raising-the-bar-with-vanoc%E2%80%99s-sustainability-initiatives_120772gZ.html | publisher=Official VANOC website| accessdate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site preparation==
VANOC spent $16.6 million to upgrade facilities at [[Cypress Mountain]], where the freestyle (aerials, moguls, ski cross) and snowboarding events were held.{{citation needed|date=February 2010}}  With the opening in February 2009 of the $40-million [[Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre]] at [[Hillcrest Park]], every sports venue for the 2010 games was completed on time and about a year prior to the start of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=www.CRSportsNews.com - Free Press Release Distribution Center |url=http://www.crsportsnews.com/?id=785988&amp;keys=Olympics-Venue-Vancouver-Paralympic |title=New Vancouver 2010 Sports Venues Completed |publisher=Crsportsnews.com |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/vancouver-2010-sport-venues-completed-on-time-and-within-$580-million-budget.-vancouver-olympic-paralympic-centre-opens-today-as-a-model-of-sustainable-building-_63896GI.html |title=Vancouver 2010 sport venues completed on time and within $580-million budget |publisher=Official VANOC website |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
