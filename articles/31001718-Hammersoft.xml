<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="31001718" ns="0" title="Hawthorne MLR station"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Hawthorne MLR station''' is a planned light rail stop located at the border of the suburbs of [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] and [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]] and on the [[Metro Light Rail]] line in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. The stop is planned for completion in 2012. The extension will make use of the former Rozelle branch of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] heavy rail freight corridor and operate from the current light rail terminus at [[Lilyfield MLR station|Lilyfield]] to [[Dulwich Hill Interchange MLR station|Dulwich Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/rail/lightrail-extension.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/file/rail/SLRE-Community-Update-July-August-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The stop's name is a reference to the [[Hawthorne Canal]] which runs parallel to the line through this area. The stop is also located close to the Hawthorne Canal Reserve and Hawthorne Parade. The stop is estimated to be used by 375 boarding passengers per weekday by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorprojects.planning.nsw.gov.au/files/61649/08_Environmental%20Assessment%20-%20Volume%201%20-%20Part%20C1%20-%20Chapter%2010.pdf Environmental Assessment - Volume 1 - Part C1 - Chapter 10.] Table 10.1 p 201. Transport NSW.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

Located adjacent to parkland, the stop will be built on level ground, which negates the need for lifts or stairs. A footpath will be built between the closest streets - Hawthorne Parade / Turner Avenue and Darley Road / Lyall Street - including a bridge over the canal. This will improve access between Leichhardt and Haberfield - the two suburbs are separated by the railway and pedestrian access between them has been limited.
