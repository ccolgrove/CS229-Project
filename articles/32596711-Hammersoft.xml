The '''Shelby County Republican Party (Alabama)''' is the organization governing the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Party in [[Shelby County, Alabama|Shelby]] County, [[Alabama]].

== Dominant political party of Shelby County ==

The Shelby County Republican Party has dominated politics in Alabama's fastest growing county&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shelbyal.com/] Welcome to Shelby County, Alabama&lt;/ref&gt; since 1986, is widely recognized as the âmost Republicanâ county in the state, and ranks as one of the top conservative-friendly counties in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/2010/03/19/americas-top-20-conservative-friendly-counties/] Palko, Chris; &quot;Americaâs Top 20 Conservative-friendly Counties&quot;, ''The Daily Caller'', Published: 2:05 AM 03/19/2010; Updated: 5:46 PM 04/26/2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[general election]] of November 2010, of thirty-six (36) [[elected officials]] with either residency or jurisdiction (or both) in Shelby County, all are Republicans. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/crimson-tide_516689.html] Barnes, Fred; &quot;Crimson Tide: Alabama goes very, very red.&quot;, ''The Weekly Standard'', Nov 22, 2010, Vol. 16, No. 10&lt;/ref&gt; This number excludes municipal elected officials, which are elected on a non-partisan basis.  Nevertheless, several mayors and city council members among the various municipalities identify themselves as Republicans.

== Organization and Governance ==

The Shelby County Republican Party is one of the 67 county affiliates of the [[Alabama Republican Party]].  The county party organization is governed by the Shelby County Republican Executive Committee.  Its members are selected in the Republican [[Primary election]] once every four years, coinciding with the election of constitutional officers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.state.al.us/conoff.html], Alabama Department of Archives and History Website; Alabama Constitutional Officers.&lt;/ref&gt; and legislators, with the most recent election cycle being in 2010. The Shelby County Republican Executive Committee is responsible for electing the County Chairman and all other officers, including Vice-Chairman, Secretary, and Treasurer, who run the day-to-day operations of the party.  All serve on a volunteer basis, without compensation.  Additionally, the officers comprise the Steering Committee, and are joined by four (4) Directors (Finance Director, Research Director, Publicity Director, and Training Director), each appointed by the chairman, and nine (9) Zone Directors, each elected by caucus of the Executive Committee members from each respective zone (county commission district), and a Legal Counsel/Parliamentarian, also appointed by the chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shelbycountygop.org/?q=node/15], Shelby County GOP Website]; About: Documents: Shelby County Republican Executive Committee By-Laws, Latest Revision.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2010-2014 term, places on the Executive Committee are described in the following table:

== Recent History ==

Today in Shelby County, Republicans hold office in all nine (9) legislative seats in the [[Alabama Legislature]].  This includes three (3) [[Alabama Senate]] seats and six (6) seats in the [[Alabama House of Representatives]].  Republicans hold office as Probate Judge, Sheriff, Property Tax Commissioner, Superintendent of Education, and Coroner.  All nine (9) seats on the Shelby County Commission, and all five (5) seats on the Shelby County Board of Education are held by Republicans. In the 18th Judicial Circuit, which is solely Shelby County, all four (4) Circuit Judges and both (2) District Judges are Republicans, as are the District Attorney and Circuit Clerk.  Additionally, serving in statewide office with residence in Shelby County are the Secretary of State and Judge on the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.  [[Robert J. Bentley]], the current [[Governor of Alabama]], is a native of Shelby County.  Shelby County is part of [[Alabama's 6th congressional district]], and thus the county is representated by a Republican in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and, furthermore, both of Alabama's members of the [[United States Senate]] are Republicans.  [[Alabama State Board of Education]] District 3 and District 6 include Shelby County, and both seats are held by Republicans.
