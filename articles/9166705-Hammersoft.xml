'''MTV RomÃ¢nia''', the Romanian branch of [[MTV]], is a national channel in [[Romania]].

It was officially launched on 15 June 2002, as the 10th regional channel of MTV in Europe (and second eastern European after [[MTV Polska]]) with a big concert performed by [[Enrique Iglesias]] on [[Lia Manoliu Stadium]]. It took over the air license previously used by [[MCM RomÃ¢nia]], which was a franchise of the French music channel [[MCM (French TV)|MCM]]. From 2008 MTV Networks Europe will give over operations to [[Pro TV]] to manage the Romanian channel while MTVN Europe will still own the brand and output. Several shows are made up locally, featuring Romanian music and artists. Some of the most popular shows on the channel are the Romanian version of [[Total Request Live]], [[Hitlist Romania]] and [[Dance Floor Chart]]. MTV RomÃ¢nia also shows a variety of reality shows (mainly imported from MTV US) but also local, like [[Dance Star]] in 2006. Since its launch, the channel also aired several TV shows and cartoons, like [[The Osbournes]], [[Yo Momma]], [[Pimp My Ride]], [[Punk'd]], [[Boiling Points]], [[Daria]], [[Beavis and Butthead]], [[Where My Dogs At?]].
However, the best music videos and programs are mainly shown through the night, as in the old [[MTV Europe]] days. Several classic shows are still on after many years, mainly [[Party Zone]], [[Stylissimo]], [[Yo! MTV Raps]]. Other shows such as local versions of [[Chill Out Zone]], [[Alternative Nation Festival|Alternative Nation]] or [[Superock]] used to be aired on MTV RomÃ¢nia also after their cancellation on MTV Europe but were eventually discontinued.
