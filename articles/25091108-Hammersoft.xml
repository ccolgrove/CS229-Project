Lewis charges rap stars with hiding [[Satan]]ic images in their music.&lt;ref name=&quot;stripes1&quot;/&gt; He is currently the pastor of the Arlington Bible Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://arlingtonbiblechurch.com/maintemp.html |title=Coming Soon |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==His message==
Lewis preaches a message he says he received from God.&lt;ref name=&quot;stripes1&quot;/&gt; On his DVD ''The Truth Behind Hip Hop l'' Lewis states that heavy metal music has affected Caucasian youth across America by leading them to Satan worship, suicide, and drug use. Lewis believes that hip-hop culture is &quot;the greatest attack on the youth of the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;stripes1&quot;/&gt; Conversely, [[hip hop]] has resulted in the same for [[African American]] youth.&lt;ref&gt;http://exministries.com/vision.html&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis also challenges people to see that [[rapping|rap music]] and hip hop are not the same. He states that hip hop is a sub-culture and a religion, not a genre of music.&lt;ref&gt;http://exministries.com/whyhhh.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lewis is mostly known for his message against hip hop culture and what he considers false doctrine, he also preaches about the importance of family and encourages youth on his weekly radio show on [[KHVN]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Lewis and EX Ministries also offers followers to subscribe to the Daily Word delivered Monday-Friday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Word Sign Up&quot;&gt;http://www.exministries.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical response==
Lewis has been criticized as an extremist who hates secular music of any kind and misrepresents the [[Hip-hop culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stripes1&quot;/&gt; Lewis has also targeted [[Christian]] leaders, including [[Kirk Franklin]], and [[T.D. Jakes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasobserver2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2005-12-08/music/hip-hop-s-public-enemy/2 |title=Dallas Music - Hip-hop's Public Enemy - page 2 |publisher=Dallasobserver.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His ministry has also encouraged the destruction of CD and other hip-hop merchandise.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasobserver2005&quot;/&gt; On his official website Lewis provides responses to critics of his ministry.&lt;ref&gt;http://exministries.com/arguments.html&lt;/ref&gt;
