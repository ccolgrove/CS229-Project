'''GNU Hurd''' (usually referred to as '''the Hurd''') is a [[free software]] [[Unix-like]] replacement for the [[Unix]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;What Is the GNU Hurd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/what_is_the_gnu_hurd.html |title=What Is the GNU Hurd? |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It has been under development since 1990 by the [[GNU Project]] of the [[Free Software Foundation]]. It consists of a set of protocols and [[server (computing)|server processes]] (or [[daemon (computer software)|daemons]], in [[Unix]] terminology) that run on the [[GNU Mach]] [[microkernel]]; together they are intended to form the [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] of the [[GNU]] operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;What Is the GNU Hurd&quot;/&gt; The Hurd aims to surpass [[Unix]] operating systems in functionality, security, and stability, while remaining largely compatible with them. The GNU Project chose the [[microkernel|microkernel serverâclient architecture]] for the operating system, due to perceived advantages over the traditional Unix [[monolithic kernel]] architecture.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

''HURD'' is a [[mutual recursion|mutually]] [[recursive acronym]], standing for ''HIRD of Unix-replacing daemons'', where ''HIRD'' stands for ''HURD of interfaces representing depth''. As both ''hurd'' and ''hird'' are just alternate spellings for the English word ''herd'', the full name ''GNU Hurd'' is also a play on the words ''[[herd]] of [[wildebeest|gnus]]'', reflecting how the kernel works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/what_is_the_gnu_hurd/origin_of_the_name.html |title=GNU Hurd: Origin of the Name |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==
Development on the GNU operating system began in 1984 and initially made good progress. Free GNU tools started to acquire a good reputation and were often adopted in preference to proprietary tools provided by system vendors.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  By the early 1990s, the only major component missing was the kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html |title='&amp;#39;Linux and the GNU Project'&amp;#39; |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development on the Hurd began in 1990 after an abandoned kernel attempt in 1986, based on the research [[Trix (operating system)|TRIX]] operating system developed by Professor [[Steve Ward (Computer Scientist)|Steve Ward]] and his group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT's]] [[Laboratory for Computer Science]] (LCS).&lt;ref name=&quot;hurd-hist&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history.html | title = The GNU Hurd History, &quot;How it Started&quot; | accessdate = 2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Thomas Bushnell]], the initial Hurd architect, their early plan was to adapt the [[4.4BSD]]-Lite kernel and, in hindsight, &quot;It is now perfectly obvious to me that this would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very different place today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050727225542530 | title = The Hurd and BSDI|accessdate = 2006-08-08 | author = Peter H. Salus | work = The Daemon, the GNU and the Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1987, due to a lack of cooperation from the [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] programmers, [[Richard Stallman]] proposed instead to use the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach microkernel]] developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Work on this was delayed for three years due to uncertainty over whether CMU would release the Mach code under a suitable license.&lt;ref name=&quot;hurd-hist&quot;/&gt;

With the release of the [[Linux kernel]] in 1991, the primary user of GNU's [[userland (computing)|userland]] components soon became operating systems based on the Linux kernel ([[Linux distribution]]s), prompting the coining of the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|controversial term ''GNU/Linux'']].

Development of the Hurd has proceeded slowly. Despite an optimistic announcement by Stallman in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,88464,00.asp | title = Free Software Sees GNU Loose of Linux | accessdate = 2006-08-08 | author = John Ribeiro | publisher = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] | date=2002-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; predicting a release of GNU/Hurd later that year, the Hurd is still not considered suitable for production environments. Development in general has not met expectations, and there are still bugs and missing features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/status.html |title=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/status.html |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has resulted in a poorer product than many (including Stallman) had expected.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This is the way, also, that people thought was the cleanest possible way to design kernels back in 1990. Well, it took many many many years to get this kernel to run at all, and it still doesn't run well, and it looks like there may be fundamental problems with this design, which nobody knew about back in 1990.&quot; [http://fsfeurope.org/documents/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html &quot;The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom; March 9th 2006&quot;], transcript of a lecture given by Richard Stallman in [[Zagreb]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, after twenty years under development, Stallman said that he was &quot;not very optimistic about the GNU Hurd. It makes some progress, but to be really superior it would require solving a lot of deep problems&quot;, but added that &quot;finishing it is not crucial&quot; for the GNU system because a free kernel already existed in [[Linux]], and completing Hurd would not address the main remaining problem for a free operating system: device support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reddit.com/tb/cv7sw RMS AMA] (Interview with Richard Stallman) [[Reddit]], July 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debian]] project, among others, have worked on the Hurd project to produce binary distributions of Hurd-based GNU operating systems for [[IBM PC compatible]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/ |title=Debian GNU/HURD project |publisher=Debian.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Unlike most [[Unix-like]] kernels, the Hurd uses a [[serverâclient architecture]], built on a [[microkernel]] that is responsible for providing the most basic kernel services &amp;ndash; coordinating access to the [[Computer hardware|hardware]]: the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (through [[process management (computing)|process management]] and [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]]), [[Random access memory|RAM]] (via [[memory management]]), and other various [[input/output]] devices (via [[I/O scheduling]]) for sound, graphics, mass storage, etc. In theory the microkernel design would allow for all device drivers to be built as servers working in [[user space]], but today most drivers of this kind are still contained in the [[GNU Mach]] [[kernel space]]&lt;!-- Hurd is not monolithic or so called &quot;hybrid kernel&quot;. The OS servers in kernel space are not part of the GNU Mach microkernel and it is separeted from the servers--&gt;. This is because, initially, user-space drivers would have suffered from performance loss, due to the overhead of the Mach interprocess communication. With the performance of today's machines, it is possible that this overhead would no longer cause a significant performance problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2007-03/msg00089.html |title=Re: Device drivers in Mach? |publisher=Lists.gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hurd developers Neal Walfield and Marcus Brinkmann gave a critique of the Hurd architecture, known as &quot;the critique&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/critique.html A Critique of the GNU Hurd Multi-server Operating System]&lt;/ref&gt; and a proposal for how a future system may be architected, known as &quot;the position paper&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/ng/position_paper.html Improving Usability via Access Decomposition and Policy Refinement]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Choice of microkernel===
From early on, the Hurd was developed to use [[GNU Mach]] as the microkernel. This was a technical decision made by [[Richard Stallman]], who thought it would speed up the work by saving a large part of it. He has admitted that he was wrong about that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/2000101200421OPCYRH
|title= Richard Stallman: In Defense of Red Hat
|quote=I take full responsibility for the technical decision to develop the GNU kernel based on Mach, a decision which seems to have been responsible for the slowness of the development. I thought using Mach would speed the work by saving us a large part of the job, but I was wrong.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Unix-like systems working on the [[Mach kernel|Mach microkernel]] include [[OSF/1]], [[Lites]], and [[MkLinux]]. [[Mac OS X]] and [[NeXTSTEP]] use [[hybrid kernel]]s based on Mach.

From 2004 onward, various efforts were launched to port the Hurd to more modern microkernels. The [[L4 microkernel family|L4 microkernel]] was the original choice in 2004, but progress slowed to a halt. Nevertheless, during 2005, Hurd developer [[Neal Walfield]] finished the initial memory management framework for the L4/Hurd port, and [[Marcus Brinkmann]] ported essential parts of [[glibc]]; namely, getting the process startup code working, allowing programs to run, thus allowing the first user programs (trivial ones such as the [[hello world program]] in C) to run. Since 2005, most of the developers' time has gone into thinking about [[Coyotos]] ([[Extremely Reliable Operating System|EROS]] successor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/l4-hurd/2005-10/msg00755.html |title=Re: A comment about changing kernels |publisher=Lists.gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/l4-hurd/2006-07/msg00004.html |title=Re: seL4, L4.sec and coyotos mess |publisher=Lists.gnu.org |date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Marcus Brinkmann and associates met with Jonathan Shapiro (a primary architect of the Coyotos Operating System) to aid in and discuss the use of the Coyotos kernel for GNU/Hurd. These discussions continued into 2007, but progress was slow.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}  In 2008, Neal Walfield began working on the Viengoos microkernel as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://walfield.org |title=walfield.org |publisher=walfield.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/microkernel/viengoos.html |title=GNU Hurd/ microkernel/viengoos |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, Shapiro announced that work on the Coyotos project had ceased.

As of 2011, development on Viengoos is paused due to Walfield lacking time to work on it.  In the meantime, others have continued working on the Mach variant of Hurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/faq/which_microkernel.html |title=What happened to the L4/Coyotos/viengoos micro-kernels? |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unix extensions===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2007}}
A number of traditional Unix concepts are replaced or extended in the Hurd.

Under Unix, every running program has an associated [[user id]], which normally corresponds to the user that started the [[process (computing)|process]]. This id largely dictates the actions permitted to the program. No outside process can change the user id of a running program. A Hurd process, on the other hand, runs under a ''set'' of user ids, which can contain multiple ids, one, or none. A sufficiently privileged process can add and remove ids to another process. For example there is a password server that will hand out ids in return for a correct login password.

Regarding the [[file system]], a suitable program can be designated as a ''translator'' for a single file or a whole directory hierarchy. Every access to the translated file, or files below a hierarchy in the second case, is in fact handled by the program. For example a file translator may simply redirect read and write operations to another file, not unlike a Unix [[symbolic link]]. The effect of Unix ''[[mount (computing)|mounting]]'' is achieved by setting up a filesystem translator (using the &quot;settrans&quot; command). Translators can also be used to provide services to the user. For example, the [[ftpfs]] translator allows a user to encapsulate remote FTP sites within a directory. Then, standard tools such as [[ls]], [[cp (Unix)|cp]], and [[rm (Unix)|rm]] can be used to manipulate files on the remote system. Even more powerful translators are ones such as [[UnionFS]], which allows a user to unify multiple directories into one; thus listing the unified directory reveals the contents of all the directories (a feature that is missing in many Unixes, although available in modern [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSDs]]).

The Hurd requires a [[Multiboot Specification|multiboot]]-compliant [[booting|boot loader]], such as [[GNU GRUB|GRUB]].

===Architecture of the servers===
According to the Debian documentation there are 24 servers (18 core servers and 6 file system servers) named as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-server |title=Preliminary GNU/Hurd User Interface Description |publisher=Debian.org |date=1996-10-10 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Core servers====
* '''auth''' ([[authentication server]]) : Receives requests and passwords from programs and gives them an ID, which changes the privileges of the program.
* '''crash''' ([[Crash (computing)|crash]] server):
* '''exec''' (execution server): Translates an executable image (currently [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] and [[a.out]] are supported) to a runnable image in memory.
* '''fifo''' ([[FIFO]] translator):
* '''new-fifo''' (new FIFO server)
* '''firmlink''' (the firmlink translator):
* '''fwd''' (forward server)
* '''hostmux''' (host multiplexer server);
* '''ifsock''' (server for sockets interface):
* '''init''' ([[init]] server)
* '''magic''' (magic server)
* '''null''' (null server): implements [[/dev/null]] and /dev/zero
* '''pfinet''' (pfinet server)
* '''pflocal''' (pflocal server)
* '''proc''' (process server)
* '''symlink''' ([[symbolic link]] translator)
* '''term''' (terminal server)
* '''usermux''' (user multiplexer server)
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

====Filesystem servers====
;The ext2fs server &quot;ext2fs&quot;
:The [[ext2]] filesystem translator. It receives disk blocks from the microkernel and gives files and directories to the applications.
;The iso filesystem server &quot;isofs&quot;
:The translator for the [[ISO 9660]] filesystem. Translates blocks of a CD or DVD to files and directories for the applications.
;The nfs server &quot;nfs&quot;
:See [[Network File System (protocol)|Network File System]].
;The ufs server &quot;ufs&quot;
:Translator for the BSD filesystem of the same name, [[Unix File System|UFS]].
;The ftp filesystem translator &quot;ftpfs&quot;
:See [[File transfer protocol]]
;&quot;storeio&quot;
:The storage translator

The servers collectively implement the [[POSIX]] [[Applications programming interface|API]], with each server implementing a part of the interface. For instance, the various filesystem servers each implement the filesystem calls. The storage server will work as a wrapping layer, similar to the block layer of Linux. The equivalent of [[Virtual file system|VFS]] of [[Linux]] is achieved by libdiskfs and libpager libraries.

==GNU distributions running Hurd==
Hurd-based [[GNU]] distributions include:
* [[Arch Hurd]]
* Bee GNU/Hurd
* [[Debian GNU/Hurd]]
* [[Gentoo/Alt#Gentoo GNU Hurd|Gentoo GNU Hurd]] (abandoned)
* [http://www.superunprivileged.org/hurd/live-cd/ GNU/Hurd Live CD]

==Error messages==
A &quot;computer [[Euphemism#Death and murder|bought the farm]]&quot; message is an [[error message]] displayed on GNU Hurd when one of the servers that provide kernel-like functions reaches a &quot;hopeless&quot; situation (after which it is usually terminated). This is a rough equivalent of a [[kernel panic]] in monolithic [[Unix-like]] kernels. Its corresponding [[error code]] is the Hurd-specific &lt;tt&gt;'''EIEIO'''&lt;/tt&gt;, a reference to the folk song &quot;[[Old McDonald Had a Farm]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/faq/old_faq.html|title=Old Hurd FAQ: What does &quot;computer bought the farm&quot; mean ?|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
