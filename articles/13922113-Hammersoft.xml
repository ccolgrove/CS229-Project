The '''[[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] educational system''' is the second-largest [[Christian school]] system in the world, after the Roman Catholic system (see [[Catholic school]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

It has a total of 7,598 educational institutions operating in over 100 countries around the world with over 1.5 million students world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.gc.adventist.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The denominationally-based school system began in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Education&quot;&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/mission_and_service/education.html.en Education] on the church's official website&lt;/ref&gt; The church supports [[holistic education]]:
:&quot;Mental, physical, social, and spiritual health, intellectual growth, and service to humanity form a core of values that are essential aspects of the Adventist education philosophy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Education&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Journal of Adventist Education]]'' (JAE) is published.
