The Keydets played every sport independently until 1918, when they joined the short-lived [[South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] in 1918 for all sports. With the demise of the conference in 1921, VMI stayed an independent until joining the [[Southern Conference]] in 1924, and a massive one at the time.

The next change to be made would not come until 59 years later when VMI formed a lacrosse program that would play in the [[United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmikeydets.com//pdf8/737294.pdf VMI Lacrosse Record Book]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, after 79 years in the SoCon, VMI departed for a then fledgling [[Big South Conference]] (where they currently are now) in all sports but lacrosse and wrestling. Wrestling stayed in the SoCon, while the lacrosse program moved to the [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference|MAAC]]. When water polo became the newest sport at the Institute in 2009, they accepted their invitation also to the MAAC in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmikeydets.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=589413&amp;SPID=72435&amp;DB_OEM_ID=9800&amp;ATCLID=205159184 Water Polo Accepts Invitation into Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==

[[Image:2008-0831-VMI-AlumniMemorialField.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Alumni Memorial Field]]
VMI football history dates back to 1891 with the formation of a team under [[Walter Taylor (American football)|Walter Taylor]]. It actually dates back farther, with a one game season in 1873, though is not really considered an official season (there were also no player or coaching records). Today, the Keydets play at 10,000-seat [[Alumni Memorial Field]], as they have since 1962. [[Sparky Woods]] is the current head coach. He was named VMI's 30th all-time coach on February 13, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080214180232/http://vmikeydets.com/article.asp?articleid=90260 Sparky Woods Named New VMI Head Football Coach]&lt;/ref&gt; Woods replaced [[Jim Reid (American football)|Jim Reid]] who left to coach outside linebackers for the Miami Dolphins. The Keydets are still looking for their first winning season since 1981.
==Basketball==
{{Main|VMI Keydets basketball}}
Arguably the most famous years for the Keydets were in 1976 and 77. The first year, VMI made their way to the Elite 8 led by future Laker [[Ron Carter (basketball)|Ron Carter]]. The Keydets prevailed over Tennessee and DePaul, before bowing to Rutgers 91-75. However, they wouldn't have to wait long for another chance. The next season, VMI edged Duquesne by 7 to get to the Sweet Sixteen. The Keydets second tournament run came to a halt with a 93-78 loss to Kentucky. Since then, VMI has not won a conference championship or made an NCAA tournament appearance. VMI is coached by [[Duggar Baucom]], who will be entering his 7th year in 2011-12. [[Cameron Hall]] has been the home of VMI basketball since 1981.
==Baseball==
Baseball is in fact the oldest sport at VMI, when the team was formed in 1866. Recorded schedules only go back as far as 1951, when the team was under the command of Frank Summers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmikeydets.com/pdf8/766257.pdf VMI Baseball Record Book]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, the Keydets have been coached by Marlin Ikenberry. VMI has been SoCon finalists on numerous occasions, but never won a SoCon championship and currently have not won a Big South championship. 
==Wrestling==
{{Main|VMI Keydets wrestling}}
For 25 years, VMI has been coached by John Trudgeon, a William and Mary graduate, and is assisted by Chris Skrtetkowicz and Jon Kemmerer. Two All-Americans have wrestled for the Institute. In the 1994 [[NCAA Wrestling Team Championship|NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships]], Charlie Branch finished 4th at 142 lbs. Ghanaian wrestler Leslie Apedoe placed sixth in the heavyweight in the 1999 tournament. VMI has played in 1,200-seat Cocke Hall since 1926.
==Club sports==
VMI fields eleven different club sports, only one of which are women's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vmi.edu/content.aspx?tid=25935&amp;id=25943&amp;ekmensel=8f9c37c3_231_4294967315_btnlink Club Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;
