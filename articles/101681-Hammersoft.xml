'''Georgetown University''' is a [[private university|private]], [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], [[research university]] whose main campus is in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Founded in 1789, it is the oldest [[Roman Catholic universities and colleges in the United States|Catholic university]] in the United States. Georgetown administers 180 academic programs in four [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and three [[Graduate school|graduate]] and professional schools, and the programs in international affairs and law are particularly selective and well regarded. In addition to its main campus, renowned for the neo-Romanesque [[Healy Hall]], Georgetown operates a [[Georgetown University Law Center|law center]] on [[Capitol Hill]], as well as auxiliary campuses in [[Villa Le Balze|Italy]], [[McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies|Turkey]], and [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar|Qatar]].

Georgetown's founding by [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] realized efforts dating from 1634 to establish a Roman Catholic college in the [[province of Maryland]]. Georgetown expanded into a branched university after the [[American Civil War]] during the presidency of [[Patrick Francis Healy]], who was born a slave by law. Georgetown celebrates its religious heritage, which includes Jesuit involvement since 1805, but the university has always been governed independently of church authorities and of the Society of Jesus.

The university has around 7,000 [[undergraduate]] and over 8,000 [[post-graduate]] students from a wide variety of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds. Georgetown's main campus is home to dozens of student groups, including the [[Mask and Bauble Dramatic Society|oldest student theater group]] and the [[Students of Georgetown, Inc.|largest student-run business]] in the United States. Georgetown's most [[List of Georgetown University alumni|notable alumni]] have served in leadership positions in government in the United States and abroad; among them are former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], and the heads of state or government of more than a [[List of Georgetown University alumni#Heads of State and/or Government|dozen countries]]. Georgetown's athletic teams are called the [[Georgetown Hoyas|Hoyas]]. The [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|men's basketball team]] has won a record-tying seven [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East championships]], has played in five [[Final Four]]s, and won a national championship in 1984.

=== Founding ===
[[File:Proposal to establish George-Town Academy (Georgetown University) - 1787.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] published his proposals for a school at Georgetown in 1787, after the [[American Revolution]] allowed for the free practice of religion.]]
[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] settlers from England founded the [[Province of Maryland]] in 1634.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite journal |title= Miniatures of Georgetown, 1634 to 1934 |first= Edward A. |last= Fitzpatrick |journal= The Journal of Higher Education |volume= 7 |issue= 1 |month= January |year= 1936 |pages= 56â57 |accessdate= November 14, 2007 |doi= 10.2307/1974310 |last2= Nevils |first2= William Coleman |jstor= 1974310 |publisher= Ohio State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1646 defeat of the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] in the [[English Civil War]] led to stringent laws against Roman Catholic education and the extradition of known Jesuits from the colony, including [[Andrew White (missionary)|Andrew White]], and the destruction of their school at Calverton Manor.&lt;ref name=Nevils&gt;{{harvnb|Nevils|1934|pp=1â25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During most of the remainder of Maryland's colonial period, Jesuits conducted Catholic schools clandestinely. It was not until after the end of the [[American Revolution]] that plans to establish a permanent Catholic institution for education in the United States were realized.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06458a.htm |title= Georgetown University |encyclopedia= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |year= 1909 |publisher= Robert Appleton Company |first= E.I. |last= Devitt |accessdate= July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s recommendation, [[Pope Pius VI]] appointed former Jesuit [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] as the first [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|head of the Roman Catholic Church in America]], even though the papal [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|suppression of the Jesuit order]] was still in effect. Carroll began meetings of local clergy in 1783 near [[Annapolis, Maryland]], where they orchestrated the development of a new university. On January 23, 1789, Carroll finalized the purchase of the property on which Dahlgren Quadrangle was later built.&lt;ref name=loyola/&gt; Future Congressman [[William Gaston]] was enrolled as the school's first student on November 22, 1791, and instruction began on January 2, 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curran|1993|pp=33â34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early years, Georgetown College suffered from considerable financial strain, relying on private sources of funding and the limited profits from local lands owned by ex-Jesuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maryland Society of Jesus began its restoration in 1805, and Jesuit affiliation, in the form of teachers and administrators, bolstered confidence in the college.&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/guhistory.html |title=Georgetown: A Brief History |first= Robert Emmett |last= Curran |work= [http://www12.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/index.html Undergraduate Bulletin] |publisher= Georgetown University |date= July 7, 2007 |accessdate= August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Congress]] issued Georgetown the first federal [[university charter]] in 1815, which allowed it to confer degrees, and the first Bachelor degrees were awarded two years later.&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web |url= http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide5.html |title= The Federal Charter |work= [http://www.georgetown.edu/home/about.html About Georgetown] |accessdate= March 6, 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080103020623/http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide5.html |archivedate= January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, the school received a [[corporation|corporate]] charter, under the name &quot;The President and Directors of Georgetown College&quot;, affording the growing school additional legal rights. In response to the demand for a local option for Roman Catholic students, the [[Georgetown University School of Medicine|Medical School]] was founded in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://som.georgetown.edu/docs/History.pdf |format= PDF |work= [[Georgetown University School of Medicine]] |title= History |date= March 23, 2008 |accessdate= March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil War ===
[[File:Georgetown 1861.jpg|thumb|Union soldiers across the Potomac River from Georgetown University|alt=Black-and-white photo of several military men idling on a river bank. Across the river are several large buildings.]]
The [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]] greatly affected Georgetown as 1,141&amp;nbsp;students and alumni enlisted and the [[Union Army]] commandeered university buildings.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt; By the time of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s May 1861 visit to campus, 1,400&amp;nbsp;troops were stationed in temporary quarters there. Due to the number of lives lost, enrollment levels remained low until well after the war was over. Only seven students graduated in 1869, down from over 300 in the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|pp=36â39}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its founding in 1876, the Georgetown College Boat Club, the school's [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] team, adopted blue, used for [[Uniform of the Union Army|Union uniforms]], and gray, used for [[Uniforms of the Confederate States military forces|Confederate uniforms]], as its colors to signify the peaceful unity among students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hoyasaxa.com/sports/colors.htm |title= Georgetown Traditions: The Blue &amp; Gray |work= [http://www.hoyasaxa.com/ HoyaSaxa.com] |accessdate= April 26, 2007 |date= August 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the school adopted these as its official colors.

Enrollment did not recover from the war until the presidency of [[Patrick Francis Healy]] from 1873 to 1881. Born a slave by law, Healy was the first acknowledged head of a predominantly white American university with [[African American|African heritage]].{{Ref label|healy|b|b}} He is credited with reforming the undergraduate [[curriculum]], lengthening the medical and law programs, and creating the [[Alumni association|Alumni Association]]. One of his largest undertakings was the construction of a major new building, subsequently named [[Healy Hall]] in his honor. For his work, Healy is known as the school's &quot;second founder.&quot;&lt;ref name=pfh&gt;{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul31.html |title= Patrick Francis Healy Inaugurated |work= [[Library of Congress]] [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html American Memory] |date= July 31, 2006 |accessdate= July 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion ===
After the founding of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=bulletin/&gt; The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate [[School of Nursing and Health Studies|School of Nursing]] in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://explore.georgetown.edu/news/?ID=2938 |title= Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies Appoints New Director of Development |date= July 30, 2003 |accessdate= April 26, 2007 |first= Lindsey |last= Spindle |publisher= Georgetown University |work= [http://gumc.georgetown.edu/communications/ Office of Communications]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgetown Preparatory School]] relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the University in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://contentdm.lndlibrary.org/u?/gtown,13 |title= Third Grammar Class, Second Section, on the steps of Healy Hall at Georgetown University |work= [http://www.lndlibrary.org/ Loyola Notre Dame Library] |accessdate= September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service|School of Foreign Service]] (SFS) was founded in 1919 by [[Edmund A. Walsh]], to prepare students for leadership in foreign commerce and diplomacy.&lt;ref name= bulletin/&gt; The School of Business was created out of the SFS in 1957, and in 1998 was renamed the [[McDonough School of Business]] in honor of alumnus Robert E. McDonough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/gsb-takes-new-name-1.1887082 |title= GSB Takes New Name |work= [[The Hoya]] |first= Emily |last= Lyons |date= October 9, 1998 |accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides expansion of the University, Georgetown also aimed to expand their resources and their student body. The School of Nursing has admitted female students since its founding, and most of the university was made available on a limited basis by 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide17.html |work= [http://www.georgetown.edu/home/about.html About Georgetown] |title= Georgetown University history: Co-Ed |accessdate= July 17, 2007 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080103023223/http://guide.georgetown.edu/slideshows/slides/show11_slide17.html |archivedate= January 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the College of Arts and Sciences welcoming its first female students in the 1969â1970 [[academic year]], Georgetown became fully [[coeducation]]al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/areen-outlines-women-s-role-1.1887300|title= Areen Outlines Women's Role |date= April 1, 2003 |accessdate= May 1, 2011 |work= [[The Hoya]] |first= Nick |last= Timiraos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgetown ended its bicentennial year of 1989 by electing [[Leo J. O'Donovan]] as president. He subsequently launched the Third Century Campaign to build the school's endowment.&lt;ref name=degioia&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehoya.com/degioia-named-next-gu-president-1.1886283|title= DeGioia Named Next GU President |first= Tim |last= Sullivan |work= [[The Hoya]] |date= February 16, 2001 |accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, Georgetown completed the campaign after raising over $1&amp;nbsp;billion for financial aid, academic chair endowment, and new capital projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/capital-campaign-close-to-1-billion-1.1886694|title= Capital Campaign Close to $1 Billion |first= Nick |last= Timiraos |work= [[The Hoya]] |date= September 12, 2003 |accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John J. DeGioia]], Georgetown's first lay president, has led the school since 2001, and has continued its financial modernization and sought to &quot;expand opportunities for intercultural and interreligious dialogue&quot;, such as by opening a [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar|campus in Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://president.georgetown.edu/sections/biography/ |title= Biography |work= [http://president.georgetown.edu/ Office of the President] |month= February | year= 2005 |publisher= Georgetown University |accessdate= August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jesuit tradition ===
[[File:Georgetown Jesuit Residence.jpg|thumb|Students studying outside Wolfington Hall Jesuit Residence|alt=Three young adults lie on grass reading books in front of a brick building with many windows.]]

Georgetown University was founded by former Jesuits in the tradition of [[Ignatius of Loyola]] and is a member of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]].&lt;ref name=loyola&gt;{{cite web |url= http://explore.georgetown.edu/documents/?DocumentID=736 |title= Georgetown's Catholic and Jesuit Identity |date= February 15, 2008 |publisher= Georgetown University |accessdate= March 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://explore.georgetown.edu/documents/?DocumentID=29138 |title= Jesuit Ideals Drive Daily Life at Georgetown |work= Blue &amp; Gray |date= November 5, 2007 |accessdate= November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgetown is not a [[pontifical university]], though three Jesuits serve on the forty member Board of Directors, the school's highest governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://president.georgetown.edu/sections/governance/board/ |title= Board of Directors |date= July 2, 2009 |work= [http://president.georgetown.edu/ Office of the President] |publisher= Georgetown University |accessdate= July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty-nine members of the [[Society of Jesus]] live on campus, and are mostly employed by Georgetown as professors or administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jesuits.georgetown.edu/JCListing.cfm |title= Jesuit Community Members |work= [http://jesuits.georgetown.edu/index.html Jesuit Community] |publisher= Georgetown University |year= 2007 |accessdate= August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesuit Heritage Week has been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/gu-celebrates-jesuit-heritage-week-1.1895993|title= GU Celebrates Jesuit Heritage Week |first= Oluseyi |last= Fasoranti |work= [[The Hoya]] |date= February 2, 2010 |accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role that Georgetown's Catholic heritage has played in its policies has been controversial at times, even as its influence is relatively limited.&lt;ref name=wildes&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/shades-of-gray-define-catholic-complexities-1.1891761|title= Shades of Gray Define Catholic Complexities |author= Wildes, Kevin |date= February 13, 2004 |work= [[The Hoya]] |accessdate= August 15, 2011 |authorlink= Kevin Wildes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stores in University-owned buildings are not allowed to sell or distribute [[birth control]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Chains-Effective-for-Georgetown-Protestors-89366827.html |title= Chains Effective for Georgetown Protesters |date= March 29, 2010 |work= [[WRC-TV|NBC Washington]] |accessdate= June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgetown University Medical Center]] and [[Georgetown University Hospital]], operated by [[MedStar Health]], are prohibited from performing abortions.&lt;ref name=medstar&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/university-medstar-agree-to-hospital-sale-1.1887199 |title= University, MedStar Agree to Hospital Sale |first= Tim |last= Haggerty |work= [[The Hoya]] |date= February 25, 2000 |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital does, however, perform research using [[embryonic stem cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A61643-2004Jan29 |title= GU to Continue Controversial Research |author= Argetsinger, Amy and Avram Goldstein |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date= January 30, 2004 |accessdate= August 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgetown has drawn criticism from religious groups, including the [[Cardinal Newman Society]], for hosting prominent [[pro-choice]] politicians as speakers, such as [[John Kerry]] and [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehoya.com/catholic-group-criticizes-gu-profs-1.1881660 |title= Catholic Group Criticizes GU Profs |first= Vidhya |last= Murugesan |date= September 9, 2005 |accessdate= 2011-03-20 |work= [[The Hoya]] |accessdate= 2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehoya.com/protests-come-to-campus-alongside-obama-1.1894829 |title= Protests Come to Campus Alongside Obama |first= Marie |last= Sahrmann |date= April 14, 2009 |accessdate= May 1, 2011 |work= [[The Hoya]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's baseball team, then called the Stonewalls, began in 1870, and football in 1874, and the chant likely refers to one of these teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|Williams|2003|pp=54, 62â63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 [[Georgetown Hoyas football|the football team]] replaced [[Sergeant Stubby]] as mascot with a [[Bull Terrier]] they nicknamed &quot;Hoya&quot; because of the cheer, and by 1928, campus sports writers began to refer to teams as &quot;Hoyas&quot; rather than &quot;Hilltoppers&quot;.&lt;ref name=hoia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hoyasaxa.com/sports/hoia.htm |title= What's A Hoya? |work= [http://www.hoyasaxa.com/ HoyaSaxa.com] |date= August 17, 2005 |accessdate= April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://library.georgetown.edu/dept/speccoll/dogs.htm |title= The Dogs of Georgetown |work= Georgetown Magazine |date= SeptemberâOctober 1983 |first= Jon K. |last= Reynolds |publisher= Georgetown University Library |accessdate= June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was picked up in the local publications, and became official shortly after.
