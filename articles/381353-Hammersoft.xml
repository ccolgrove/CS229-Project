He assumed his current assignment on October 1, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;CJCS&quot;&gt;By law, [http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000152----000-.html 10 USC 152], Dempsey assumed office on October 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Biography ==
Dempsey attended [[John S. Burke Catholic High School]] in [[Goshen (village), New York|Goshen]], New York and received a commission as an [[Armor Branch|Armor]] officer upon graduation from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1974. As a [[company-grade officer]], he served in 1st Squadron, [[2d Armored Cavalry Regiment]] as the S-1 OIC. He went on to be the Executive Officer of the 3rd Brigade 3rd Armored Division during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. He then commanded the 4th Battalion of the 67th Armored Regiment &quot;Bandits&quot; from 1992â1995 in the 1st Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany (Hessen).

In June 2003, then [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] Dempsey assumed command of [[US 1st Armored Division|1st Armored Division]]. He succeeded Lieutenant General [[Ricardo S. Sanchez]] who was promoted to command [[United States V Corps|V Corps]]. Dempsey's command of the 1st Armored Division lasted until July 2005 and included 13 months in Iraq, from June 2003 to July 2004.  While in Iraq, 1st Armored Division, in addition to its own brigades, had operational command over the [[2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment]] and a brigade of the [[82nd Airborne Division]]; the command, called &quot;Task Force Iron&quot; in recognition of the Division's nickname, &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, was the largest division-level command in the history of the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iron Soldiers: Mission complete|url=http://www.nationalcenter.org/LeavingIraq7-8-04.pdf|work=1st Armored Division Public Affairs|publisher=1st Armored Division Public Affairs|accessdate=July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that the U.S. intervention in Iraq changed dramatically as [[Fallujah]] fell to Sunni extremists and supporters of Muqtada Sadr built their strength and rose up against American forces.  Then Major General Dempsey and his command assumed responsibility for the Area of Operations in Baghdad as the insurgency incubated, grew, and exploded.  General Dempsey has been described by Thomas Ricks in his book &quot;Fiasco&quot;: &quot;In the capital itself, the 1st Armored Division, after Sanchez assumed control of V Corps, was led by Gen. Martin Dempsey, was generally seen as handling a difficult (and inherited) job well, under the global spotlight of Baghdad.&quot; 

On March 27, 2007, Dempsey was promoted from commander of Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq, to be reappointed as a lieutenant general and assigned as deputy commander of U.S. [[Central Command]], MacDill Air Force Base, Fla.

On February 5, 2008, Dempsey was nominated to head the [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh United States Army/U.S. Army, Europe]] and was nominated for promotion to four-star general upon Senate approval.   

On March 11, 2008, Dempsey's commander, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William J. Fallon]], retired from active service. Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] accepted this as effective on March 31. Dempsey took over command as acting commander CENTCOM.

On March 13, 2008, Dempsey was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] as Commander, [[Seventh United States Army|Seventh United States Army/U.S. Army, Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/legislative/one_item_and_teasers/noms_confn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the resignation of Admiral Fallon, he never assumed command over Seventh Army and became Acting Commander, [[U.S. Central Command]]. Instead, General [[Carter Ham|Carter F. Ham]] assumed command of the Seventh Army on August 28, 2008.

On December 8, 2008, Dempsey took command of [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Tice |title=Dempsey takes command of TRADOC |curly=y |work=[[Army Times]] |date=December 8, 2008 |accessdate=December 9, 2008 |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2008/12/army_command_change_120808w/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2011, Defense Secretary [[Robert Gates]] announced that he would nominate General Dempsey to succeed [[General Casey|General George Casey]] as the Army Chief of Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lance |last=Bacon |title=TRADOC head is pick to become chief of staff |curly=y |work=[[Army Times]] |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=January 6, 2011 |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/01/army-general-martin-dempsey-is-chief-of-staff-pick-010611w/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2011, Gates announced that President [[Barack Obama]] nominated Dempsey to be the 37th [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Officer Announcements|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14255|publisher=Department of Defense|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2011, Dempsey testified before the [[Senate Armed Services Committee|United States Senate Committee on Armed Services]] for reappointment to the grade of general and to be the 37th [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hearing Schedule|url=http://armed-services.senate.gov/e_witnesslist.cfm?id=5014|publisher=U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee|accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2011, the [[Senate Armed Services Committee|U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services]] affirmatively reported Dempsey's nomination to serve as the 37th [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] to the floor of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brannen|first=Kate|title=Sen. committee confirms Dempsey as Army chief|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/03/defense-dempsey-confirmed-as -next-army-chief-031511/|work=Sen. committee confirms Dempsey as Army chief|publisher=Army Times|accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2011, the Senate confirmed Dempsey's nomination by unanimous consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/B?r112:@FIELD%28FLD003+s%29+@FIELD%28DDATE+20110316%29 Senate Congressional Record for March 16, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 11, 2011, Dempsey was officially sworn in as 37th [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] at a ceremony at [[Fort Myer]].

With Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] set to retire as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in September 2011, President Obama needed to select his replacement. The Vice-Chairman, Marine General [[James Cartwright]], who was initially believed to be the front runner for the job, had fallen out of favor among senior officials in the Defense Department. Obama administration officials revealed on May 26, 2011, that the President would nominate Dempsey to the post of Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Starr|first = Barbara|title=Obama to choose Army head as next Joint Chiefs chairman, officials say|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/05/26/joint.chiefs.chairman/index.html?hpt=T2|publisher=CNN|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2011 General Dempsey was confirmed by unanimous consent to succeed Admiral Mike Mullen as the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

He was officially sworn in as 18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on October 1, 2011, succeeding Admiral [[Michael Mullen]].
