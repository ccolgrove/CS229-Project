If that werenât enough, Colin played a lead role, as Jackson Patch in The Dog Days of Summer, along with veteran actor Will Patton. Capping off a busy year, Colin was back in Vancouver playing Zeph, the son of Jason Statham and Claire Forlani in the epic adventure, In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Story, in theaters January 2008. He stars in a new fim called &quot;We Bought a Zoo.&quot; which premeres December, 2011.
