The '''Umma Islamic Party''' is a political party in [[Saudi Arabia]] that was formed on February 10, 2011 in response to the [[2010-2011 Middle East and North Africa protests]]. Formed by a collective of opposition members including [[Islamists]] and [[intellectuals]], the party is pro-reform and demands representation and an end to [[absolute monarchy]] in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;threuters_umma_created&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Ulf | last=Laessing| pages= | language =| title=Pro-reform Saudi activists launch political party | date=2011-02-10 | publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/10/us-saudi-opposition-idUSTRE71942L20110210?sp=true |accessdate=2011-02-11 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQOpuC8A |archivedate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party is run by a ten member coordination committee and requested official recognition from the government as an official party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moderate Saudi scholars form kingdom's first party|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=34394|accessdate=21 February 2011|newspaper=The Jordan Times|date=11 February 2011|agency=Associated Pres}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 18, the leaders of the party were arrested by Saudi authorities.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi authorites detain founders of new party|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021802641.html|accessdate=21 February 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 February 2011|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrested leaders were told they would be released only if they signed a pledge to stop advocating for political reform. All refused to sign.&lt;ref name=&quot;post&quot;/&gt;

==Creation in 2011==
Five founding members of the Umma Islamic Party, Dr. Ahmad bin Sa'd al-Ghamidi, Professor Sa'ud al-Dughaithir, Shaikh Abd al-`Aziz al-Wuhaibi, Shaikh Muhammad bin Husain al-Qahtani, Professor Muhammad bin Nasir al-Ghamidi, Walid al-Majid and Professor Abd al-Karim al-Khadhar, were detained on 17 February 2011. [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that the five &quot;appear to have been detained solely for trying to create a party whose professed aims included greater democracy and protection for human rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW_Mabahith_Umma&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=post /&gt; Prior to his own arrest, al-Khadhar stated that his colleagues were apparently held in the [[Mabahith]]'s [[`Ulaysha Prison]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW_Mabahith_Umma&quot; /&gt;
