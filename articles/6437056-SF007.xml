=== Dreamlinux 3.0 (2008) ===

Dreamlinux Desktop Edition 3.0 features a complete redesign. It supports a totally independent architecture named Flexiboost, based on overlaid modules. The feature allows the co-existence of two (or more) separate window managers{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} (currently Gnome and Xfce), sharing the same customized appearance. Both working environments share all the applications available.

In addition to the 700MB iso file (CD image), a 130MB Multimedia Module is also available, including DVD support.  This is primarily intended for use when running from USB flash drive, rather than from live-CD mode.

== Dreamlinux 3.5 (2009) ==

Dreamlinux 3.5 is an update to the original Dreamlinux 3.0 desktop. This release features the XFCE desktop with the Gnome Desktop as an additional option in the form of a module. This release uses the Debian Lenny desktop. It features the Linux kernel version 2.6.28.5 as well as new icons and a new GTK+ theme.

There is also the option to install directly to a USB Memory Stick in two modes.

; Live Dream

This runs the same as a Live CD, and does not save changes.

; Persistent Dream

This runs as though Dream is installed onto the hard drive, and saves any changes to configuration that are made. It is only recommended for use on USB drives that are 2 GB.

==Live USB==
A [[Live USB]] version of Dreamlinux can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=UNetbootin - Universal Netboot Installer|url=http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/|publisher=''[[Sourceforge]]''|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
