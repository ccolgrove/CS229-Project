In [[computing]], '''nouveau''' is a software project aiming to develop [[free software]] [[Device driver|drivers]] for [[Nvidia]] [[Video card|graphics cards]], by [[reverse engineering]] Nvidia's current [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] drivers for [[Linux]]. This project by [[X.Org Foundation]] and [[freedesktop.org]] was initially based on the [[Obfuscated code|obfuscated]] 2D-only [[free software|free]] and [[Open-source software|open-source]] &quot;nv&quot; driver. The name of the project refers to the fact that &quot;nouveau&quot; means &quot;new&quot; in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name was suggested by the original author's IRC client's French autoreplace feature which suggested the word &quot;nouveau&quot; when he typed &quot;nv&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most other 3D graphics drivers for [[X.Org]], nouveau is implemented as a [[Modular programming|module]] and is licensed under the [[MIT License|MIT license]]. It originally used the [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]] (DRI) of [[Mesa 3D (OpenGL)|Mesa 3D]] for rendering [[3D computer graphics]], which allows to accelerate 3D drawing using the [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) directly from the 3D application; but in February 2008 the work on DRI support ceased and moved on to the new [[Gallium3D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Adoption==
The nouveau driver has been used as the default open-source driver for Nvidia cards in the [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] 11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[openSUSE]] 11.3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url        = http://en.opensuse.org/Product_highlights#Base_System
 | title      = Product highlights for openSUSE 11.3 version

}}&lt;/ref&gt; distributions of [[Linux]]. It is included in the repository of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 9.04&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url       = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=NjkxNg

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made default in Ubuntu 10.04.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-nv/+bug/454821/comments/2
 | title = Bug #454821 : Bugs : âxserver-xorg-video-nvâ package : Ubuntu
 | accessdate = 2010-02-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also included in [[Debian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url    = http://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=nouveau&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=stable&amp;section=all
 | title  = Nouveau nVidia drivers now available in Debian experimental
 | author = [[Debian]]
 | date   = 2011-02-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drivers included in these operating systems, however, do not allow hardware acceleration of 3D operations.  

On 10 December 2009 nouveau was accepted in the 2.6.33 version of [[Linux kernel]] as a staging driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Nzc5NQ

 | date = 2009-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fedora 13 (May 2010) allows installing the mesa-dri-drivers-experimental package, which activates experimental hardware acceleration for 3d graphics, which was not activated without this package.

3D acceleration is included in the Ubuntu 10.10 archives in the libgl1-mesa-dri-experimental package.  It is being considered for default installation in Ubuntu 11.04 for improved [[Unity (desktop environment)|Unity]] support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | date      = 2010-12-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compiz]] recommends nouveau over the Nvidia proprietary driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | date   = 2010-05-21
 | quote  = Our recommendation: Use nouveau.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
The project uses several custom-made programs for its reverse engineering, such as MmioTrace (Memory Mapped I/O Trace)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/MmioTrace
 | title = MmioTrace (Memory Mapped I/O Trace)
 | publisher = nouveau Wiki
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and REnouveau.

===REnouveau===
REnouveau ('''R'''everse '''E'''ngineering for '''nouveau''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/REnouveau
 | title = REnouveau (Reverse Engineering for nouveau)
 | publisher = nouveau Wiki
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a program licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GNU GPL]] (using [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]]) that collects data for most of nouveau's reverse engineering work. Users with the proprietary NVIDIA drivers can help the development of nouveau by providing information about the hardware of their NVIDIA cards through REnouveau. REnouveau works by copying the current graphics card [[Memory-mapped I/O|MMIO]] register space, drawing some graphics and taking another copy of the MMIO, and outputting the difference to a text file. It runs about six [[dozen]] different tests which the user of the computer then makes a [[tar (file format)|tar]].[[bzip2|bz2]] archive of and submits by [[e-mail]], after which it is automatically transferred to the project's FTP servers for the developers to analyze.
