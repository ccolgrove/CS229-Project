MV ''Senopati Nusantara'' was on scheduled time to bring passengers and vehicles crossing the [[Java Sea]] from [[Borneo]] to [[Java]] islands. On December 30, 2006, the ship sunk about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} off [[Mandalika]] island. According to the manifest, the ship was carrying 628 people including 57 crew,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[ANTARA]]| url=http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/?id=25334| accessdate=2007-01-11| title=More saved, hundreds missing after Indonesia ferry sinks| date=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later press releases from government officials gave an inconsistent number of total passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;hatta&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[ANTARA]]| url=http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/?id=25305| title=Ill-fated KM Senopati was still sea-worthy: minister| date=31 December 2006| accessdate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormy weather was the initial suggestion as the main cause of the disaster. Local officials of the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency (BMG), however, did not ban the vessel from sailing; and the official at the Kumai port issued a sailing permit based on the weather report.&lt;ref name=&quot;hatta&quot;/&gt; From one survivor account, the ship rolled over and part of the body was sticking out the water before it submerged into the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;survBBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6230063.stm| accessdate=2007-01-11| title=Eyewitness: Java ferry survivor| date=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong winds and sea currents hampered rescue efforts that the [[search and rescue| search and rescue team]] had to widen the search radius, expanding up to hundreds of kilometers away. In the first two days, the search team in helicopters faced difficulties in distinguishing survivors from the sea foam created by high waves. Even survivors on the life rafts found it difficult to stay alive. &quot;There were three very big waves. They dragged us down, and when we re-surfaced I saw the child was dead. I took his body and tied him to the raft using my trousers,&quot; told a survivor after he was rescued by a fishing boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;survBBC&quot;/&gt;

Immediate rescue efforts were made by local fishermen and rescue workes. At least 177 survivors were found; 151 of them were saved ashore, 15 were picked up by a Vietnamese ship heading towards Surabaya and 11 were rescued by a fishing boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;antara3112&quot;/&gt; Although the Indonesian Navy had sent six warships, one CASA plane, one Bell helicopter, two speedboats, one Nomad plane, one C-130 Hercules, one CN-235 airplane and two Bolco helicopters to find survivors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[ANTARA]]| title=TNI send more warships and planes to help evacuate sinking ship victims| url=http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/?id=25318| date=31 December 2006| accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; only a few more survivors were found in the following days, some of which were located by chance.

On January 3, 2007 (5 days after the event), twelve survivors (11 men and a six-year-old boy) were found on an unmanned [[Oil platform|oil rig]] {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; another six were found on Java island.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc3Jan&quot;/&gt; They had floated in life rafts waiting to be rescued for days without food; some did not survive and their bodies had to be thrown into the water. They were taken immediately to a hospital in [[Surabaya]]. Other survivors witnessed dozens of bodies floating in the sea.

On January 5, 2007, fifteen victims were found stranded on [[Kangean Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;antara5Jan&quot;/&gt; On January 8, 2007, a group of fifteen survivors were picked up by a passing cargo ship from a life raft near [[Bali]], {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; one of them died soon after the group was rescued.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc8Jan&quot;/&gt; The fourteen survivors, who survived by drinking rainwater and eating food supplies stored in the life raft for 10 days, were then taken to [[Makassar]], [[South Sulawesi]].
