}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, Disney announced that the Jetix channel in certain countries (namely the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]] and [[Bulgaria]]) will be renamed to [[Disney Channel]], marking that channel's first introduction in these countries. The channel was replaced on September 19, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney Channel&quot;&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=18685 Jetix to become Disney] - ''Broadband TV News'', by Chris Dziadul, published and retrieved: 2009-05-26&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2011, Disney Channel Czech Republic started using the same and updated on-air logo as in the United States, along with several other Disney Channels across Europe, completing its transitional rebrand to the new look. The new logo has debuted on the Czech feed prior to appearing on the UK, German, French, Dutch and Spanish feeds first.

The [[Playhouse Disney]] programming block was rebranded to [[Disney Junior]] in the Czech Republic and Slovakia on June 1st, 2011.
