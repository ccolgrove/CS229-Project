The '''Sardinian people''' or '''Sardinians''' are the people from or with origins in the island of [[Sardinia]] (now an [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]] of [[Italy]]), in the [[Mediterranean sea]], which forms part of [[southern Europe]]. 

==Origin and influences==
{{See also|History of Sardinia}}
The Sardinian people are originally from the island of Sardinia, which was populated in waves of emigration from the [[Paleolithic]] period until recent times. Sardinia was first colonized in a stable manner during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] by people from the [[Iberian peninsula]] or the [[Italian peninsula]]. During the [[Neolithic]] period, people from Italy , Spain and the Aegean area settled in Sardinia. In the [[Eneolithic]]-Early [[Bronze age]] the &quot;[[Beaker folk]]&quot; from the Franco-Iberian area and from [[Central Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;Manlio Brigaglia -  Storia della Sardegna , pg. 48-49-50&lt;/ref&gt; settled on the island, bringing new metallurgical techniques and ceramic styles and probably some kind of [[Indoeuropean languages|indoeuropean]] speech.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Ugas - L'alba dei Nuraghi , pg.22-23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuragic civilization]] arose during the Middle Bronze Age. At that time the island was divided into three or more major ethnic groups , the most important being the ''Iliensi'', the ''Balari'' and the ''Corsi''.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Ugas - L'alba dei Nuraghi, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Nuragic Sardinians have been connected by some scholars to the [[Shardana]], a tribe of the [[Sea Peoples]], which appear several times in ancient Egyptian records,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sardiniapoint.it/5085.html SardiniaPoint.it - Interview with Giovanni Ugas, archaeologist and professor of the University of Cagliari {{it}}]&lt;/ref&gt; but this hypothesis has been discredited by most historians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The language (or the languages) spoken in Sardinia during the bronze age is unknown . According with some reconstructions the &quot;''[[Paleo-Sardinian language|Proto-Sardinian language]]''&quot; was a derivate of the [[Basque language]] with similarities with the [[Iberian language|ancient Iberian]] . Other scholars believe that there were various linguistic areas (two or more) , possibly pre-indoeuropeans and indoeuropeans.  

In the 10th century BC, the [[Phoenicians]] founded cities and ports along the coast, such as [[Cagliari|''Caralis'']], [[Chia, Italy|''Bithia'']], [[Sulci|''Sulki'']] and ''[[Tharros]]''.

The south of the island was partially conquered by the [[Carthaginians]] in the 6th century BC and was conquered by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] in the 3rd century BC. Sardinia, with the exception of the central mountainous area, was heavily &quot;[[Latinization (historical)|Latinized]]&quot; during the Roman period, and the modern [[Sardinian language]] is considered the most conservative [[Romance language]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Sardinia was ruled in rapid succession by the [[Vandals]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the [[Ostrogoths]]&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Cesare Casula - La Storia di Sardegna, pg.141&lt;/ref&gt; and again by the Byzantines.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the island was divided into four &quot;[[Giudicati]]&quot; (Kingdoms) who came under the influences of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and the [[Republic of Pisa|Pisans]]. Genoa founded the cities of [[Alghero]] and Castelgenovese ([[Castelsardo]]) while the Pisans founded ''Castel di Castro'' ([[Cagliari]]) and ''Villa di Chiesa'' ([[Iglesias]]), who become with [[Sassari]] a [[Medieval commune|commune]]. From 12th century in the northwestern Sardinia, mainly in [[Nurra]] and [[Anglona]], trades and immigration from Tuscany, Corsica and Liguria led to the birth of [[Sassarese language]], still spoken in many centers.

From [[1324]] to [[1420]] Sardinia came under the rule of [[Kingdom of Aragon]] who repopulated the cities of Castel di Castro and Alghero with colonists, mainly [[Catalans]].&lt;ref&gt;Manlio Brigaglia - Storia della Sardegna , pg.158&lt;/ref&gt; Catalan is still spoken today in the city of Alghero. 

The Spanish era ended in 1720 when the whole island came under the control of the [[Dukes of Savoy]], who assumed the title of &quot;''Kings of Sardinia''&quot;. During the period, Savoy ruled [[Liguria]]n and Piedmontese families settled on the island of [[San Pietro Island|San Pietro]] and in [[Sant'Antioco]], in the south-west area of Sardinia, bringing with them a Ligurian dialect called &quot;Tabarchino&quot;, spoken today in that area. The Kingdom of Sardinia annexed the whole peninsula and [[Sicily]] in 1861 after the [[Risorgimento]], becoming the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861â1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. There was extensive emigration from the mainland during the Fascist government when people from [[Veneto]] but also from [[Marche]], [[Abruzzo]] and [[Sicily]] came to Sardinia to populate the new mining town of [[Carbonia, Sardinia|Carbonia]] and the villages of Mussolinia (now [[Arborea]]) and [[Fertilia]]. [[Venetian language|Venetian]] and [[Friulan language|Friulan]] are still spoken today in Arborea by the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.regione.veneto.it/videoinf/periodic/precedenti/99/1/celebrazioni.htm Veneti nel Mondo (Venetians in the World) - Anno III - numero 1 - Gennaio 1999 {{it}}]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Istriot language|Istriot]] and [[Venetian Language|Venetian]] are spoken in [[Fertilia]].

==Geographical distribution==
Most Sardinians are native to the island but a sizable percentage have settled outside Sardinia, mostly in mainland [[Italy]]; for example, between 1955 to 1971, over 70,000 Sardinians emigrated to [[Piedmont]]. There are also sizable Sardinian communities in [[Liguria]], [[Lombardy]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Lazio]]. It had been estimated that always between [[1955]] and [[1971]] 308,000 Sardinians have emigrated in other Italian regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asei.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=42:lemigrazione-della-sardegna&amp;catid=65:articoli&amp;Itemid=250 Giuseppe Sanna - L'emigrazione della Sardegna (Emigration of Sardinia) {{it}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Sardinians and their descendants are also numerous in [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Argentina]]. Small communities with Sardinians ancestors, about 5000 people, are also found in [[Brazil]] (mostly in the cities of [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[SÃ£o Paulo]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regione.sardegna.it/messaggero/2005_aprile_17.pdf Il messagero sardo - Una piccola ma attiva colonia di sardi vive nello stato di Bahia {{it}}]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[UK]] and [[Australia]].

==Languages==
The languages spoken by Sardinians are:
* [[Italian language]] (''italiano''), includes its regional variety;
* [[Sardinian language]] (''sardu''), divided into the standardised varieties of [[Campidanese language|campidanese]] (''campidanesu'') and [[Logudorese language|logudorese]] (''logudoresu'');
* [[Sassarese language]] (''sassaresu''), language born as a [[lingua franca]] of [[Tuscan language|tuscan]]-[[Corsican language|corsican]] origin, with minor [[Ligurian language (Romance)|ligurian]], [[Catalan language|catalan]] and [[Spanish language|spanish]] influences and major [[Logudorese language|logudorese sardinian]] influence;

==Genetic peculiarities of the population==
Sardinians are one of the most genetically isolated population in Europe and , according with some studies , together the [[Basques]] represents an example of pre-indoeuropean population survived in Europe from the  [[Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2010/10/continuity-between-neolithic-bronze-age.html &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Ish7688voT0/TMsh0ddYFdI/AAAAAAAACys/PT47z5W_1xw/s1600/ADMIXTURE10.png&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Haplogroup I.png|thumb|190px|Haplogroup I Distribution in Europe]]
Though Sardinians do not constitute a homogeneous population from a genetic point of view, in comparison to other European and Mediterranean populations, Sardinians are distinguished by genetic characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ata.org.tn/fichier_PDF/Article2.pdf |title=Sardinian Population (Italy): a Genetic Review|publisher= International Journal of Modern Anthropology|year= 2008|page= 55|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Y-DNA===
About 42% of the Sardinians belong to [[haplogroup I (Y-DNA)|Y-chromosome haplogroup I]], which is otherwise frequently encountered only in [[Scandinavia]], Northern [[Germany]] and the [[Croatia]]-[[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]-[[Montenegro]]-[[Serbia]] area.

Furthermore, the I haplogroup of the [[indigenous (people)|indigenous]] Sardinians is of the I2a1 subtype (I-M26) , which is almost unique to the island, though it takes origin in the [[Pyrenees]] region. The I2a1 haplogroup also has a low distribution around the [[Pyrenees]] , the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], the department of [[BÃ©arn]] and [[Brittany]] in France, [[England]], [[Sweden]] and [[Corsica]]. The second most common Y-chromosome haplogroup among Sardinian male population is the [[haplogroup R1b]] (22% of the total population) mainly present in the northern part of the island . Sardinia also has a relatively high distribution of [[haplogroup G (Y-DNA)|Y-chromosome haplogroup G]] (15%), which is also found in the [[Caucasus]] , the [[Pyrenees]] and the Switzerland [[Alps]] . Other haplogroups show lower frequencies.

===MtDNA===
The most common mtDNA haplogroups in Sardinia are [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]] (H1 and H3) and [[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]] who are also particularly common in the [[iberian peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;Paolo Francalacci-IL POPOLAMENTO UMANO DELLA SARDEGNA VISTO DALLA PROSPETTIVA DEI SISTEMI GENETICI UNIPARENTALI [http://dbs.unica.it/congressoaai/html/SessioneSardegna.html]{{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some subclades typical of Sardinia and rare in the rest of Europe are:

The subclade U5b3a1 of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)]]  came from [[Provence]] to Sardinia by [[obsidian]] merchants, as it is estimated that 80% of obsidian found in France comes from [[Monte Arci]] in Sardinia reflecting the close relations that existed at one time for these two regions. Still about 4% of the female population in Sardinia belongs to this haplotype.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moebiusonline.eu/fuorionda/doc/art_postglac2009.pdf] American Journal of Human Genetics : Mitochondrial Haplogroup U5b3:
A Distant Echo of the Epipaleolithic in Italy and the Legacy of the Early Sardinians&lt;/ref&gt;
One other interesting anomaly is the  presence of H13a of [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)]] is present in the island at around 9.2%. As this is an extremely rare subclade normally present in the Caucasus, its worthy of further investigation.
