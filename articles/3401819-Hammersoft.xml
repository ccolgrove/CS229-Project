==History==
===The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company (DC)===
The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company was founded in June 1883. C&amp;P Telephone Co. provided telephone service to Washington, D.C.

In July 1969, [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon's]] telephone call to astronauts on the moon originated from C&amp;P Telephone Co. equipment.

===The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland===

The C&amp;P Telephone Company of Maryland was founded in [[1884]] as '''The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Baltimore City'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www22.verizon.com/about/community/md/counties/baltimore/baltimore_city.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. It changed its name to '''The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland''' on [[January 3]], [[1956]], and the corporate name at this point changed to C&amp;P Telephone of Maryland&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdatcert3.resiusa.org/UCC-Charter/DisplayEntity_b.aspx?EntityID=D00511931&amp;EntityName=VERIZON+MARYLAND+INC.&amp;TabNum=2 Maryland Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt;.

C&amp;P relaxed its rule against the hiring of African-Americans for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] jobs in January 1943 due to labor shortages during World War II, but [[telephone operator]] positions remained [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] until the hiring of Hermie Graham for a position at a C&amp;P office in [[Mid-Govans, Baltimore|Govans]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia===
[[Image:C&amp;PVA.jpg|thumb|right|C&amp;P Tel. Co. of Virginia logo, 1964-1969]]
The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia was founded in 1903.

In [[2010]], operations in [[Alleghany County, Virginia|Alleghany County]] that served customers in [[Crows, Virginia|Crows]] and [[Hematite, Virginia|Hematite]] were split from Verizon Virginia and transferred to [[Frontier Communications of Virginia]], a subsidiary of [[Frontier Communications]].

==Changes==
After AT&amp;T's 1969 [[corporate identity]] overhaul, which included the famous [[Saul Bass]] Bell logo, all four companies' names were shortened to '''C&amp;P Telephone''' on marketing materials, bills, vehicles, etc.  

[[Image:Cptelephone.png|thumb|C&amp;P Telephone logo, 1989-1994]] 
In 1984, when the Bell System was divided into the [[Regional Bell operating company|Regional Bell Operating Companies]], or &quot;Baby Bells&quot;, the C&amp;P Telephone companies became part of [[Bell Atlantic]].

In 1994, Bell Atlantic renamed all of its operating companies. C&amp;P Telephone was renamed:
*Bell Atlantic â Maryland, Inc.
*Bell Atlantic â Virginia, Inc.
*Bell Atlantic â Washington, D.C., Inc.
*Bell Atlantic â West Virginia, Inc.

After Bell Atlantic's merger with GTE in 2000, the system was renamed [[Verizon]], and so were its [[Bell Operating Companies]]. C&amp;P Telephone was renamed:
*Verizon Maryland, Inc.
*Verizon Virginia, Inc.
*Verizon Washington, DC, Inc.
*Verizon West Virginia, Inc.

In 2010, Verizon left the West Virginia wireline market entirely, selling Verizon West Virginia to [[Frontier Communications]] as part of a major sale of assets. The company was renamed '''Frontier West Virginia, Inc.'''
