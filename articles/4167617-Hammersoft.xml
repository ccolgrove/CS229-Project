'''Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; Robertson''' (born September 25, 1937 in [[Brackenridge, Pennsylvania]]; died February 4, 2000 in [[Fountain Valley, California]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[Figure skating|figure skater]] who was best known for his [[figure skating spins|spinning]] ability. He won the silver medal at the [[1956 Winter Olympics]] and twice won the silver at the [[World Figure Skating Championships]]. He retired from skating after the 1956 U.S. Championships, where he was nearly disqualified after he was accused by the German Figure Skating Federation for excessive expenses on a European tour. His father, Albert Robertson, a naval architect, accused [[Hayes Alan Jenkins|Hayes Jenkins]] for trying to disqualify his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19560317&amp;id=zQMkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kSUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2985,4179269 The Milwaukee Journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After a huge fight with the U.S. Figure Skating Federation, Robertson was not disqualified after he lost to Jenkins and retired from competitive figure skating and signed a two-year contract with the [[Ice Capades]] for $100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richard Goldstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/17/sports/ronnie-robertson-62-a-skater-who-entertained-with-his-spins.html?pagewanted=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Ronnie Robertson, 62, a Skater Who Entertained With His Spins | first=Richard | last=Goldstein | date=February 17, 2000 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
