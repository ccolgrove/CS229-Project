'''Memtest86''' and '''Memtest86+''' are [[Open source software|open source]] [[memory test software]] programs designed to test and [[stress testing (software)|stress test]] an [[x86 architecture]] computer's [[random access memory]] (RAM) for errors. Each tries to verify that the RAM will accept and correctly retain arbitrary patterns of data written to it, and that there are no errors where different bits of memory interact, and there are no conflicts between memory addresses.

== Description ==
There are two versions (or development streams) of Memtest86. The original is simply known as Memtest86&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memtest86.com Memtest86.com - Memory Diagnostic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.  The other, known as Memtest86+&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memtest.org Memtest86+ - Advanced Memory Diagnostic Tool&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, is a development fork  of the original Memtest86 (see history). They both have almost identical screen appearance.

These programs work with old obsolete 80386 and 80486 computers and also the latest, but now obsolete, P4 and beyond chipsets. They are updated from time to time to support newer chipsets.&lt;ref name=86chg&gt;http://www.memtest86.com/change.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=86pchg&gt;http://www.memtest.org/#change&lt;/ref&gt;

Memtest86 is designed to run as a stand-alone, self-contained program from a [[Booting|bootable]] [[floppy disk]], [[CD-ROM]], [[USB flash drive|USB Drive]], or from a suitable bootloader without an [[operating system]] present.  This is because the program must directly control the hardware being tested and leave as much of the RAM space as possible for examination.  It is also a quick and convenient way to start the program, and avoids running a complex operating system/application which could be endangered by hardware with memory problems.  (For example, a hard disk file system can be corrupted by writing erroneous data from damaged RAM.)

Memtest86's testing is very comprehensive&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memtest86.com/tech.html#algo Memtest86 - Memory Diagnostic Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; so it can find otherwise hidden problems on machines that appear to work normally. With many [[chipset]]s, Memtest86 allows counting of failures even in error-correcting [[Error-correcting code|ECC]] [[Dynamic RAM|DRAM]] (without special handling, error correcting memory circuits can mask problems with the underlying memory chips).

Running one complete pass of the program (executing all the selected tests one time) can take from a few minutes up to a few hours, depending on the amount and speed of memory installed, and the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. Some errors are so subtle that they don't occur on each pass; errors are more likely to be revealed after running many passes over an extended period.  This is because some tests use slightly different data each pass,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memtest86.com/tech.html#descri Memtest86 - Memory Diagnostic Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and errors may appear after heat builds up from extended operation.  Thus the program will run continuously until the user reboots.

== Distribution ==
Traditionally, the programs were made available on the Internet as small downloadable diskette image files, and included a small Windows program to make the floppy disk. Under Linux, the standard [[dd (Unix)|dd]] utility command is used to make the floppy disk.&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.canardpc.com/showthread.php?t=28864 Memtest86+ FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In computing, dd is a common Unix program whose primary purpose is the low-level copying and conversion of raw data. According to the manual page for Version 7 Unix, it will &quot;convert and copy a file&quot;. It is used to copy a specified number of bytes or blocks, performing on-the-fly byte order conversions, as well as more esoteric EBCDIC to ASCII conversions. It can also be used to copy regions of raw device files, for example backing up the boot sector of a hard disk, or to read fixed amounts of data from special files like /dev/zero or /dev/random.&lt;/ref&gt;  The floppy can then be booted directly on the test computer.

This mode has become obsolete as floppy disks have become obsolete, so distribution now includes a USB image and a [[bootable CD]] [[iso image]] which the user must burn to CDROM before using.   The easiest way for a beginner to access the programs may be as part of a bootable [[LiveCD]].  Popular Linux distributions such as [[Knoppix]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] offer an option when the CD starts to run Memtest immediately (instead of booting Linux).  Memtest86 and Memtest86+ are included in rescue sets of utilities, such as the [[Ultimate Boot CD]] which contains both.

Additionally, some high-end computer [[motherboards]] come with MemTest86 integrated into the [[BIOS]]. The user would simply have to press a certain key during boot-up and MemTest86 would run without a boot disk. (One example of this is the [[Biostar]] TPOWER i55 motherboard.)

== History ==
Memtest86 was developed by Chris Brady. After Memtest86 remained at v3.0 (2002 release) for two years, the Memtest86+ fork was created by Samuel Demeulemeester to add support for newer CPUs and chipsets. As of 2009, both are being actively maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memtest86.com/support.html Memtest86 - Memory Diagnostic Support Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.memtest.org/#history&lt;/ref&gt;

Memtest86 is written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Assembly language|x86 assembly]]. The source code is released under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).  The bootloading code was originally derived from [[Linux kernel|Linux 1.2.1]].  Both versions now support current [[Multi-core|dual]]- and quad-core-[[CPU]]s and the corresponding chipsets. The latest release of Memtest86+ supports [[AppleâIntel architecture|Intel-based]] [[Macintosh]] computers.

Starting from Memtest86 2.3&lt;ref name=86chg/&gt; and Memtest86+ 1.60,&lt;ref name=86pchg/&gt; the program can output a list of bad RAM regions in the format expected by the BadRAM&lt;ref&gt;[http://rick.vanrein.org/linux/badram/ BadRAM: Linux kernel support for broken RAM modules&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; patch for the [[Linux kernel]]; using this information, a Linux system can reliably use a RAM module even if it has a few bad bits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rick.vanrein.org/linux/badram/download.html BadRAM: Download area&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Grub2 is able to supply this same information to an unpatched kernel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub.html#badram GNU GRUB Manual 1.99&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; negating the need for the BadRAM patch.

== How it works ==
[[File:Memtest86+ 2-errors-found.jpg|thumb|This is what faulty memory looks like: 2 erroneous bits detected. We see not only which bits failed, but also which patterns made them fail.]]
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory address, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memtest86.com/tech.html Memtest86 - Memory Diagnostic Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data.  A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu.  It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because of refresh problems).  This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.

Memory cache (such as cache on board the CPU chip) is not disabled.  However, access patterns are designed to keep most cache organizations flushed so that memory accesses are actually seen to the RAM.

Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD ([[Serial Presence Detect]]) or EPP ([[Enhanced Performance Profiles]]), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance is error-free with these faster settings.

Some hardware is able to report the &quot;PAT status&quot; (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel [[Performance acceleration technology]]; there may be [[BIOS]] settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.

This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.

== Known problems ==
*Memtest86 3.5 is known to fail usually on computers with {{nowrap|4 GB}} of installed memory.  (The failure manifests as a spontaneous system reboot soon after the program starts running.){{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
*The multi-core version of Memtest86 3.5 has been observed to not function on systems using [[AMD Phenom|AMD]]&lt;!--correct cpu?--&gt; or [[Intel Core 2#Kentsfield|Intel Quad-core]]&lt;!--correct cpu?--&gt; CPUs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
*Version 3.5a corrects a bug in 3.5 that prevented testing more than {{nowrap|4 GB}} of memory. Version 3.5a now works with up to {{nowrap|64 GB}} of memory.
