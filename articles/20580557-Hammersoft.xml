'''Spencer State Forest''', located in [[Spencer, Massachusetts]], is a 965&amp;nbsp;acre (391&amp;nbsp;ha) forest and recreation reserve managed by the [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]]. The 92&amp;nbsp;mile (148&amp;nbsp;km) [[Midstate Trail (Massachusetts)|Midstate Trail]] passes through the state forest. The [[Massachusetts|Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] also conducts logging in some parts of the property. 

==Geography==
Spencer State Forest is divided among three non-contiguous parcels. The most notable of these, located in south Spencer, is the Howe Pond parcel, an estate formerly belonging to [[Elias Howe]], the inventor of the [[sewing machine]]. The Howe Pond parcel (sometimes referred to as Howe Park) includes a mill pond and dam constructed by the inventor. Swimming is permitted in the pond; lifeguards are present in season. The Howe Pond parcel also includes picnic tables and outdoor grills. It is located off [[Massachusetts Route 31]] via Howe Pond Road. 

The Midstate Trail passes through a parcel of Spencer State Forest located in north Spencer, in the area of Turkey Hill Brook. A primitive [[lean-to]] for overnight campers is located on the property atop the 1,014 foot (309&amp;nbsp;m) [[drumlin]] Buck Hill. A parking lot is located off McCormick Road in Spencer.

The overall geography includes hilly terrain, creeks, wetlands, and transitional [[Oak-hickory forest|oak-hickory]] to [[Northern hardwood forest|northern hardwood]] forest types.
