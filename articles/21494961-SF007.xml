The '''Turnkey Linux Virtual Appliance Library''' is an [[open source]] project developing a free [[virtual appliance]] library of pre-packaged servers based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] that can be deployed on [[virtual machines]], in [[Cloud computing|cloud computing infrastructures]] or installed in physical computers.

== Features ==

Each [[virtual appliance]] is a ready-to-use solution that's optimized for ease of use in server-type usage scenarios.&lt;ref name=&quot;TurnKeySoftwareAppliances&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Software Appliance | work = TurnKey Linux | url = http://www.turnkeylinux.org/ | accessdate = March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each appliance is designed to &quot;just work&quot; with little to no configuration required.

The project currently maintains 40 virtual appliances, which are packaged in multiple build formats:

# '''[[Amazon Machine Image]]''': provisioned on-demand via the [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud]].
# '''[[Virtual appliance]]''': a ready-to-run [[VMDK]] [[disk image]] with [[Open Virtualization Format|OVF]] support. Does not require installation.
# '''[[Live CD|Installable Live CD]]''': an [[ISO image]] which installs on both bare metal (I.e., a non-virtualized physical machine) and [[virtual machines]], including [[VMware]], [[Xen]], [[VirtualBox]], and [[Kernel-based Virtual Machine|KVM]]. This image can also run [[Live CD|live]] in non-persistent ''demo mode''.

Pre-integrated server applications include [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]], [[Joomla]], [[Drupal]], [[WordPress]], [[MySQL]], [[MediaWiki]], [[Domain controller]], [[File server]], [[Ruby on Rails]], [[phpBB]], and many others.

== History ==

Founded by engineers of an Israeli startup,&lt;ref name=&quot;Scannell2009-03-10&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Scannell | first = Ed | date = March 10, 2009 | title = TurnKey Linux Delivers Open Source Appliances | work = [[InformationWeek]] | url = http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/linux/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215801604&amp;subSection=Integration | accessdate = March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the project was conceived in mid-2008 as a community-oriented open source project that would focus on helping users piece together turnkey solutions from open source components in the largest Linux distributions. According to one of TurnKey Linux's co-founders, the project was in part inspired by a desire to provide open source alternatives to proprietary virtual appliance vendors that would be aligned with user interests and could engage the community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Panettieri2009-03-12&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Panettieri | first = Joe | date = March 12, 2009 | title = 12 Ubuntu Server Appliances Meet the Cloud | work = WorksWithU | url = http://www.workswithu.com/2009/03/12/12-ubuntu-server-appliances-meet-the-cloud/ | accessdate = March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project launched in September 2008 with three prototype appliances for Drupal, Joomla and LAMP, based on the Ubuntu 8.04.1 build.&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter108&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2008 | title = TurnKey Linux: new project builds Ubuntu based Live CD appliances | journal = Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter | issue = 108 | url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue108#TurnKey%20Linux:%20new%20project%20builds%20Ubuntu%20based%20Live%20CD%20appliances | accessdate = March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months usability was improved and a dozen additional appliances were released including Ruby on Rails, MediaWiki and Django.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fransen2009-02-25&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Fransen | first = Matto | date = February 25, 2009 | title = Kant-en-klare open source bedrijfsapplicaties | work = Infoworld | url = http://www.infoworld.nl/web/Artikel/Kant-en-klare-open-source-bedrijfsapplicaties.htm | accessdate = March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2009, the project released 40 appliances based on Ubuntu 8.04.3 including 25 new additions to the virtual appliance library. The release included support for [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud]], and a new Virtual Machine image format with [[Open Virtualization Format|OVF]] support.

TurnKey Linux was listed as a winner of the 2009 &quot;Bossies&quot; by [[InfoWorld]] as one of the &quot;Top 40 open source products&quot; of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;DineleyBorckMobley2009-08-31&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Dineley | first1 = Doug | last2 = Borck | first2 = James R. | last3 = Mobley | first3 = High | date = August 31, 2009 | title = Best of Open Source Software Awards 2009 | work = [[InfoWorld]] | url = http://infoworld.com/d/open-source/best-open-source-software-awards-2009-628?page=0,2 | accessdate = 24 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoworld.com/d/open-source/best-open-source-platforms-and-middleware-758&amp;current=7&amp;last=1#slideshowTop 2009 BOSSie for Open Source Platforms and Middleware, see Slide 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

TurnKey's virtual appliances are a series of &quot;stripped down&quot; versions of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fransen2009-02-25&quot; /&gt; To this they add the TurnKey Core, which includes all the common features for the project's virtual appliances,&lt;ref name=&quot;TurnKeyCore&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = TurnKey Linux Core - Common Base Appliance | work = TurnKey Linux | url = http://www.turnkeylinux.org/core | accessdate = March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* di-live: a live installer, derived from [[debian-installer]].
* A configuration console: developed in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] for the project to allow users to perform basic configuration tasks (for example, networking configuration, reboots)
* An automatic mechanism that installs security patches on a daily basis.
* Web administration interface based on [[Webmin]] which includes a selection of generic add-on control and configuration modules.

The TurnKey Core has a footprint of approximately 110 MB, and is available as a separate download. Application software is installed on top of the Core, which typically increases the size of a virtual appliance up to approximately 160 MB.&lt;ref name=&quot;LinuxDevices2009-03-09&quot;&gt;{{cite news | date = March 9, 2009 | title = Open source server appliances ship | work = LinuxDevices.com | url = http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9199443802.html | accessdate = March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By downloading and installing the appliance package to the hard drive, it is intended by the developers that administrators would gain an easy method of setting up a dedicated server.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fransen2009-02-25&quot; /&gt;

TurnKey's virtual appliances can be customized and extended using TKLPatch,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turnkeylinux.org/docs/tklpatch TKLPatch - a simple appliance customization mechanism]&lt;/ref&gt; a simple appliance modification mechanism. New virtual appliances can be built as high-level patches to the closest starting point in the library.

TurnKey Linux is designed to run as a [[virtual machine]] with [[VirtualBox]] and [[VMWare]], although the former has been described as having been provided with more documentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Proffitt2010-02-15&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Proffitt | first = Brian | date = February 15, 2010 | title = Virtual Appliances Offer Fast Sandboxes, Production Environments | work = ITWorld | url = http://www.itworld.com/open-source/96666/virtual-appliances-offer-fast-sandboxes-production-environments | accessdate = 24 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
