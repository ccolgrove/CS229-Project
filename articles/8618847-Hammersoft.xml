'''I Wayne''' (born '''Cliffroy Taylor''', August 1980, [[Portmore]], [[Jamaica]]), is a [[roots reggae]] [[singing|singer]]. He is known for his [[hit single]]s &quot;[[Living In Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Can't Satisfy Her]]&quot; from his debut [[album]], ''[[Lava Ground]]''.

==Biography==
I Wayne was raised by his aunt and her husband [[Ansell Collins]], a renowned [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] player.&lt;ref name=meschino/&gt; This young artist has been refining his craft since age seven. Coming from a musical family, I Wayne had first made his venture into performance as a student at Greater Portmore High School, joining a local group Vibes Machine.&lt;ref name=reggaetimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reggaetimes.com/articles/publish/article_214.shtml |title=I-Wayne |accessdate=2008-05-30 |work=ReggaeTimes |author=Gray,Avery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, consisting of singers and [[Disc jockey|DJs]], used to perform at afterwork parties at popular [[nightclub|clubs]] such as Cactus and Asylum.&lt;ref name=reggaetimes/&gt; One night, the artiste was forced to perform alone due to the fact that his bandmates were running late. The response was tremendous, and I Wayne was motivated to perfect his solo act.&lt;ref name=jstar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20050728/ent/ent3.html |title=I-Wayne's Biography |accessdate=2008-05-09 |work=The Jamaica Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2004, Wayne released ''Can't Satisfy Her'', in the new wave of [[reggae]].  The track was reportedly the first roots reggae song to be added to the influential [[WQHT|Hot 97]] playlist.&lt;ref name=meschino&gt;{{cite news | last =  Meschino | first = Patricia | title = Lava Man | work = [[Miami New Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = 2005-05-26 | url = http://www.miaminewtimes.com/Issues/2005-05-26/music/music.html | accessdate = 2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, I Wayne signed a [[recording contract]] with [[VP Records]] to release his debut album, ''[[Lava Ground]]''.&lt;ref name=jstar/&gt; ''Lava Ground'' was praised for returning to reggae's &quot;essential roots&quot; in contrast to popular reggae artists who induce listeners to &quot;dance and groove to their carefree music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lelinwalla | first = Mark | title = Sound Bites: Music Reviews | work = Associated Press Worldstream |  publisher = Associated Press | date = 2005-08-25 | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9054509/ | accessdate = 2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I Wayneâs first week sales from his second album ''[[Book of Life (album)|Book of Life]]'' (6 November 2007) took him straight to the top of the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[record chart|chart]] at the #4 spot in the reggae category.&lt;ref name=vprecords1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vprecords.com/index.php?page=artist_news&amp;a_id=51&amp;n_id=40750 |title=I-WAYNE'S BRAND NEW ALBUM &quot;BOOK OF LIFE&quot; COASTS TO THE TOP OF THE REGGAE BILLBOARD CHARTS |accessdate=2008-06-01 |work=VP Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;
