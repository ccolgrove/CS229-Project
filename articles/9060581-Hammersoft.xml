'''WHIC''' is a [[Catholic]] radio station broadcasting from [[Rochester, New York]]. WHIC is located at 1460 on the AM dial. Referred to as ''[[The Station of the Cross]]'', WHIC is owned and operated by [[Holy Family Communications]]. The station began broadcasting Catholic programming on July 1, 2003. Broadcasting at 5000 watts in the daytime and 5400 watts at night, WHIC's calls represent The Holy and Immaculate Conception, to whom this station is dedicated.

==History==
WHIC enjoys a legacy in Rochester's broadcast history. The station became Rochester's second radio operation in 1925 when the Hickson Electric Company launched the station as '''WHEC'''. It was the city's CBS Radio Network affiliate from the moment the network began operation in the late 1920s, and was acquired by the [[Gannett Company]], publishers of the ''[[Democrat and Chronicle]]'', in 1936. Until 1941 the station used a number of broadcast frequencies, but had settled on 1430&amp;nbsp;kHz by 1928 operating first with 500 and later with 1000 watts from a transmitter on Mt. Read Boulevard in the northwest portion of the city of Rochester. Following the [[North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement]] (NARBA) in 1941, WHEC was reassigned to 1460&amp;nbsp;kHz, and after the war boosted power to 5,000 watts from new transmitting facilities south of the city in [[Brighton, New York]]. In the 1950s and 1960s WHEC broadcast popular music along with local and CBS news, sharing staff and some news content with sister television station [[WHEC-TV]]. Gannett placed the station up for sale in the summer of 1971, and found a purchaser in Sande Broadcasting Company, a partnership of local investors and broadcast managers.

After the sale was finalized in 1972, the new owners rebranded the station '''WAXC''' (&quot;Waxy&quot;), and changed format to compete with the top station in the market [[WBBF]] by playing Top 40 hits. Through much of the decade of the 1970s WAXC was relatively successful both financially and in popularity (as measured by Arbitron ratings). But after 7 years of competition, toward the end of which FM stations started to cut into the audiences and revenues of both WAXC and WBBF, the callsign WAXC was retired and the station sold to American General Media, beginning the era of '''WWWG''' (&quot;3WG&quot;). At first the station operated with a full-service adult contemporary format reminiscent of the final years of Gannett ownership, competing directly with big-signal [[WHAM]]. But the station's more limited AM signal proved to be a greater liability at a time when suburbanization was spreading out the market's population geographically beyond the station's reliable nighttime pattern, and FM competition was growing. So the days of secular contemporary-format programming came to an end early in the 1980s. 

American General Media repositioned the station as a religious outlet and announced that the callsign WWWG (originally chosen simply as an easily remembered brand name) would stand for &quot;Where We Worship God&quot;. While most Rochester commercial stations had broadcast various church and synagogue services and other religious programming at some point in their history, and Pat Robertson's CBN network had owned a chain of rural FM stations whose signals could be heard in portions of the market, WWWG's policy of religious programming around the clock earned it the distinction of being the city of Rochester's first fulltime religious radio station. WWWG offered a mix of evangelical religious programming among other [[Brokered programming|brokered shows]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonradio.org/stations/6641 Boston Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2003 WWWG was purchased by Buffalo based [[Holy Family Communications]] to become the network's fourth Catholic radio venture. Holy Family created [[The Station of the Cross]] as a network name and rebranded 1460 as '''WHIC''', for the &quot;Holy and Immaculate Conception&quot;.  The similarity of the new name to the original WHEC (whose calls carry on by the local television station, [[WHEC-TV]]), may certainly also be a nod to the historic roots of the station. WHIC began carrying Catholic programming 24 hours a day, with much of the content provided by the [[EWTN]] Catholic Radio Network.
