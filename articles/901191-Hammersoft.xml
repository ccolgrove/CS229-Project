'''Peter LÃ¶wenbrÃ¤u Griffin''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[animated comedy]] series ''[[Family Guy]]'' and the [[patriarch]] of the [[Griffin family]]. He is voiced by cartoonist [[Seth MacFarlane]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of the family in the 15-minute short on December 20, 1998. Peter was created and designed by MacFarlane himself. MacFarlane was asked to pitch a pilot to the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] based on ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|Larry and Steve]]'', a short made by MacFarlane which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve. After the pilot was given the green light, The Griffin family appeared on the episode &quot;[[Death Has a Shadow]]&quot;.  

Peter is married to [[Lois Griffin|Lois Pewterschmidt]] and is the father of [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]; he also has a dog named [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. He has worked at a toy factory and at Quahog's Brewery. Despite the [[suburb]]an [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences.

Peter's voice was inspired by a janitor that MacFarlane heard at his school. His appearance was a redesign of the protagonist Larry from MacFarlane's previous animated short films, [[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|''The Life of Larry'' and ''Larry &amp; Steve'']]. The Peter Griffin character has received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics. He has appeared in several pieces of ''Family Guy'' merchandise, including toys, t-shirts and a video game, and has made [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] appearances in other shows, including ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad]]'' and the ''Family Guy'' spin-off ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.

''Family Guy'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters do not age much, so the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. However, several of the characters, such as [[Meg Griffin]], have aged two to three years since the show's [[Death Has a Shadow|pilot episode]], while others, such as [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], have remained the same age.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;  In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. In a [[running gag]], storylines are randomly interrupted by extremely long, unexpected fights between Peter and [[Ernie the Giant Chicken]], an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] chicken who serves as a rival to Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/danny-smith/credits/209563|title=Danny Smith:Credits|publisher=TV Guide |accessdate=October&amp;nbsp;27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These battles parody the [[action film]] genre, with explosions, high-speed chases and immense devastation to the town of Quahog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/05/21/family-guy-meet-the-quagmires/|title=Family Guy: Meet The Quagmires|publisher=TV Squad|last=Love |first=Brett|date=2007-05-21|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation===
When he was still in college, ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]] created a cartoon short called ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve#The Life of Larry (1995)|The Life of Larry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2006-11-05|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/05.11/03-classday.html |title=''Family Guy'' Seth MacFarlane to speak at Class Day|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate= 2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short centered around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatReporter&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/|title = Seth MacFarlane&amp;nbsp;â heâs the &quot;Family Guy&quot;|accessdate = 2009-10-18|last = Bartlett|first = James|date =  2007-03-12|work = The Great Reporter|publisher = Presswire Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a sequel called ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry %26 Steve#Larry .26 Steve .281997.29|Larry &amp; Steve]]'', which [[Cartoon Network]] broadcast in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoonist MacFarlane funny guy of Fox's 'Family' Subversive voice of series is his|date=1999-01-29|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Graham, Jefferson|page=7E}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, MacFarlane was working for [[Hanna-Barbara Studios]], writing for shows such as ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', and ''[[Cow and Chicken]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yahoovid&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=MacFarlane, Seth|year=2006|url=http://au.video.yahoo.com/watch/1929627/2891929 |title=Inside Media at MTR (2006): ''Family Guy'' 2 |work=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

In three months, MacFarlane created the Griffin family and developed a pilot for the show he called ''Family Guy''.&lt;ref name=&quot;FastCompany&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|author=Dean, Josh|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/130/family-values.html?page=0%2C3|title=Seth MacFarlaneâs $2 Billion Family Guy Empire|date=2008-10-13|accessdate= 2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian's character was largely based on Steve from the ''Larry and Steve'' cartoon, with Larry serving as the primary basis of the Peter character.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/news/events/cartoon-network-pilots-screened-asifa-east-nycs-school-visual-arts|title=Cartoon Network Pilots Screened by ASIFA East at NYC's School of Visual Arts|author=Strike, Joe|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=2007-02-13|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The character's personality was also partially inspired by a friend of his father who rudely fell asleep while watching the 1993 film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinraub&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Young Guy of 'Family Guy'|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/07/arts/television/07SETH.html?th=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times]]|author=Weinraub, Bernard|date=2004-07-07|accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network executives were impressed with the pilot and ordered thirteen episodes, giving MacFarlane a 2 million dollar per-season contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;FastCompany&quot;/&gt;

In &quot;[[Peter's Two Dads]]&quot;, it is revealed that Peter's biological father is an Irishman named Mickey, which is based on the heritage of MacFarlane's biological father.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatReporter&quot;/&gt; MacFarlane said, &quot;When I was growing up, my father had lots of friends: big, vocal, opinionated New England, Irish Catholics. They were all bursting at the seams with personality, and Family Guy came out of a lot of those archetypes that I spent years observing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatReporter&quot;/&gt;

===Voice===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=&quot;Part of it was the fact that there was no money, initially. Part of it is that it's just the way I like to work. I like the freedom of being able to just get in there and do it myself. To look at a storyboard and be involved with what the visual acting looks like, as well as the voice acting, is nice. It frees me up to do jokes that are maybe unconventional that need to be done an exact, specific way, that can only be done by involvement with both parts of the process.&quot;|source=Seth MacFarlane, on voicing the characters, Interview with ''[[The Onion]]''.&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt;}}
The voice of Peter is provided by the shows creator MacFarlane who provides the voice for Brian, Stewie and Quagmire, MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time only characters, most prominently those of news anchor [[Tom Tucker (Family Guy)|Tom Tucker]], Lois' father [[Carter Pewterschmidt]], and Dr. Hartman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoonist MacFarlane funny guy of Fox's 'Family' Subversive voice of series is his|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Graham, Jefferson|date=January 29, 1999|page=E7}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane has been part of the main voice cast from the beginning of the series including the pilot, as well he has been voicing Peter from the start.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGuide cast&quot;/&gt; MacFarlane chose to voice Peter and the rest of characters voices himself, believing it would be easier to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarlaneTIME&quot;/&gt; MacFarlaneÂ´s speaking voice is not very close to PeterÂ´s as his normal voice is used to voice Brian.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarlaneTIME&quot;/&gt; MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while he was attending the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.projo.com/tv/content/projo_20050430_macfarlan.1d6c9b8.html|work=Prohaving the vidence Journal TV|author=Smith, Andy|title=A Real Family Reunion|date=April 30, 2005|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macfarlane also voices many of PeterÂ´s ancestors which share the same type of voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;TVGuide cast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/family-guy/cast/100148 |title=Family Guy Cast and Details |work=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted in an interview that the reason that he voices Peter and the rest of the characters is partly because they initially had a small budget, but also that he prefers to have the freedom of to do it himself.&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23365 |title=Seth MacFarlane |accessdate=2007-09-26 |last=Rabin |first=Nathan |date=2006-01-26 |work=The A.V.
