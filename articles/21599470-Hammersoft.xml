Georgia Tech traveled to Land Shark Stadium in Miami Gardens, Fla. to compete against the University of Miami. Offensive Coordinator Mark Whipple and Miami Quarterback Jacory Harris prepared a game plan against Dave Wommack and the Georgia Tech Defense. Miami threw the ball for 300 yards. Tech managed to run for only 180 yards, and it earned merely 250 yards of total offense. Josh Nesbitt and Demaryius Thomas hooked up for a touchdown late in the game. On just Tech's third possession of the game, a 40 yard Roddy Jones touchdown was nullified on a block in the back call by walk-on Kevin Cone. The crucial call nullified a 14â10 score midway through the second quarter.

Georgia Tech ran for 401 yards en route to defeating Florida State 49â44 at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida. Tech had never defeated the Seminoles in Tallahassee previously. Jonathan Dwyer ran for a couple scores, one of which was a 69 yard memorable dart downfield on the first play of Tech's third possession.

Tech had four possessions in the first half, scoring on each of them. It finished with 49 points. Nesbitt added two more touchdowns, the final coming late in 4th quarter. On the game winning drive, Roddy Jones dropped a Josh Nesbitt pitch, and FSU picked it up, maintaining possession. However, Nesbitt used both of his hands to take the football back before the FSU player was down, regaining possession for Tech. Nesbitt later scored on a 25 yard scamper that same drive, sealing victory for the White and Gold. The epic scamper increased the Tech lead to 11 at 49-38. While the Tech Offense posted a career day, the Tech defense struggled. It gave up 550 yards of total offense, 408 coming in the first half. Christian Ponder had a career day, throwing for five touchdowns. FSU punted once all game, Tech never punted.

'''GT vs. [[2009 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest Demon Deacons]]'''

The Yellow Jackets, ranked in the Top 10 for the first time since 1999, hosted the Demon Deacons in Atlanta. The game got off to a quick start as Tech jumped out to a quick 10â0 lead helped by Preston Lyons first career TD. But the Deacons controlled the rest of the first half scoring 17 unanswered points. The Yellow Jackets kept committing penalties, contributing to all of Wake Forest's points. The offense also had its share of mistakes, getting called three times for chop blocks as the officials seemed to pay close attention to the interior line after opponents complained of dirty blocking tactics. After trailing 17â10 at the half, Tech's Jonathan Dwyer broke off a 59-yard TD run on Georgia Tech's first offensive snap of the second half, tying the game at 17. Wake Forest managed only one first down on its four possessions after halftime, and Georgia Tech went ahead 24â17 when Josh Nesbitt scored on a 12-yard run with 8:19 left in regulation. Wake Forest QB Riley Skinner drove the Deacons down late in the 4th quarter and threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Devon Brown with 4:27 remaining.  After Georgia Tech was stopped again on fourth down, Wake Forest appeared to be driving into range for a winning field-goal attempt. But Skinner was sacked by Derrick Morgan on third-and-7 from the Georgia Tech 35, and Wake Forest decided to punt it away and settle for OT. In the first period of OT, the Yellow Jacket defense was able to hold Wake Forest to a field goal helped by a Derrick Morgan sack on Riley Skinner on a 3rd and seven. On the Jacket's OT possession, Georgia Tech drove to the 5 where it faced fourth-and-less-than-a-yard. The Yellow Jackets initially tried to draw Wake offsides, but was forced to burn a timeout when that didn't work. Deciding to go for the first instead of kicking a field goal, Josh Nesbitt got the first down on a QB sneak. On the very next play, the Jackets were able to get into the endzone thanks to another Josh Nesbitt sneak and was able to seal the victory. The victory lifted Tech to a 9â1 record and dropped the Deacons to 4â6. The Yellow Jacket offense, also known as the Nesbone, rumbled up and down Grant Field for 412 yards, Coach Johnson's sixth 400 plus rushing yard performance in two seasons.&lt;ref name='GT Wake'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/110709aaa.html |title=Jackets Outlast Wake Forest 30â27 In Overtime Thriller Josh Nesbitt scores game-ending touchdown. |accessdate=2009-12-29 |date=Nov. 7, 2009 |publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Wake GT'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wakeforestsports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/110709aab.html |title=No. 10 Georgia Tech Hands Wake Forest 30-27 Defeat in Overtime Deacons come up just short in bid for first defeat of top 10 team since 1946 |accessdate=2009-12-29 |date=Nov. 7, 2009 |publisher=Wake Forest University Athletic Site }}&lt;/ref&gt;
