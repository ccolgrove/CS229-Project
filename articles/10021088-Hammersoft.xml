'''Weyprecht Mountains''' is a small group of [[mountain]]s about 10 miles (16 km) west of the [[Payer Mountains]], forming the western half of the [[Hoel Mountains]] in [[Queen Maud Land]]. They were discovered by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938â1939), led by Capt. [[Alfred Ritscher]], and named for [[Karl Weyprecht]], Austrian polar explorer who in company with [[Julius Payer]] discovered [[Franz Josef Land]] in 1873, and who initiated the first [[International Polar Year]] expedition in 1882-83.
