'''Linux package formats''' are the different file formats used to [[Software package (installation)|package software]] for various [[Linux distribution]]s. These are the principal kinds of package:
* [[Binary code|Binary]] packages
* [[Source code|Source]] packages

==Examples==
* [[deb (file format)|deb]] â '''Deb'''ian package, originally from [[Debian]]. Used by Debian and derivatives such as [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].
* [[ebuild]] â the file containing information on how to retrieve, compile, and install a package in [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]'s [[Portage (software)|Portage]] system using the command [[emerge]]. Typically these are source-primary installs, though binary packages can be installed in this fashion as well. Gentoo-based distributions also use the ebuild system from the same Portage tree.
* [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] â '''R'''PM '''P'''ackage '''M'''anager, originally from [[Red Hat]], is now used by many other distributors as well, like [[openSUSE]] and [[Mandriva Linux]].
* [[Tar (file format)#Compression and naming|pkg.tar.xz]] - used by [[Arch Linux]]'s [[Pacman (package manager)|Pacman]]  package manager
* [[Pardus (operating system)#PiSi package management|PISI]] is used by [[Pardus (operating system)|Pardus]].
* [[tar (file format)|tgz]] or [[Tar (file format)#Compression and naming|tar.gz]] â standard [[tar (file format)|'''t'''ar]] + [[gzip|'''gz'''ip]], possibly with some extra control files â used by [[Slackware]] and others, or sometimes when distributing very simple handmade packages.
* [[Super OS#RUNZ Framework|SuperDeb]] â an installer containing a program plus all the dependencies needed, used in [[Super OS]].
* [[LZM]] â Used by [[Slax]]. Opens with Slax Module Manager, and then gets installed to the [[KDE]] menu as a Desktop Config file. May be placed into the Slax CD's Modules folder to get installed at boot.
* [[Puppy Linux#Package and distribution management|PUP and PET]] - used by [[Puppy Linux]] - click and install package type. OS can be installed to a flash drive for portability and will bring apps with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;PupFAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://puppylinux.com/faq.htm|title = Pup FAQ|accessdate = 2008-10-27|last = Kauler|first = Barry|authorlink = |year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
