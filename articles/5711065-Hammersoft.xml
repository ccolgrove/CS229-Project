'''Route 27''' is a south&amp;ndash;north highway in eastern [[Massachusetts]].

==Route description==
[[Image:IsaacDavisMonument.jpg|left|240px|thumb|The Isaac Davis Monument in Acton, located along Route 27]]
Route 27 runs in a sweeping arc from [[Kingston, Massachusetts|Kingston]] to [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]].  For most of its route, it acts as an intermediate route between [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] and [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]].  

Route 27 begins in Kingston at [[Massachusetts Route 106|Route 106]], approximately 1-1/4 miles west of [[Massachusetts Route 3|Route 3]].  It heads northwest towards [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], passing through [[Pembroke, Massachusetts|Pembroke]], [[Hanson, Massachusetts|Hanson]], [[East Bridgewater, Massachusetts|East Bridgewater]] and [[Whitman, Massachusetts|Whitman]].  In Brockton the road shares a triple concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]] and [[Massachusetts Route 123|Route 123]] Eastbound (Route 123 Westbound only intersects with the route).  From the center of town, Route 27 heads northwest, past the [[Westgate Mall (Brockton)|Westgate Mall]], over [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] at Exits 18A-B, and past Caritas Good Samaritan Hospital before passing into [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]] via [[Stoughton, Massachusetts|Stoughton]].  

In Stoughton, the road has a brief concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 138|Route 138]] in the center of town.  It passes just south of the town of [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] before making a large loop through the town of [[Sharon, Massachusetts|Sharon]].  It crosses over [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] without access, between Exits 9 and 10, both of which are accessible via [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|US Route 1]] nearby.  It then crosses through [[Walpole, Massachusetts|Walpole]] and [[Medfield, Massachusetts|Medfield]] before crossing the [[Charles River]] into [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] and the town of [[Sherborn, Massachusetts|Sherborn]].

In Sherborn, the road begins a more northerly direction, with a short concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]] in the center of town.  The road heads through the center of [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]], passing the town green and crossing [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]], which carries the [[Boston Marathon]] at that point.  Route 27 crosses over [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]] with a four-way exit ramp system, just east of [[Lake Cochituate]], the [[Natick Collection]] and the [[Golden Triangle (Massachusetts)|Golden Triangle]] retail area.  Route 27 passes into [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]] and under the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], which it access via [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]], just north of the Pike.  

In Wayland, Route 27 has a 1.2 mile concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 126|Route 126]], passing through the center of town and intersecting [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|US Route 20]]. The road then crosses the [[Sudbury River]] into [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]].  It passes into Maynard, having a short, 0.1-mile concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]] over the [[Assabet River]], before heading north into [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]].  It crosses [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] at Exit 42 before crossing through the town center, past the [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]] Monument.  It heads into [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]], passing through the southeast corner of town before heading into [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]].  The road ends at the center of town, at the intersection of Routes [[Massachusetts Route 4|4]], [[Massachusetts Route 110|110]] and [[Massachusetts Route 129|129]], just south of [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]].

== History ==
** Route 27's original form was identical to the modern route south of [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]], but north of there it followed current [[Route 126 (Massachusetts)|Route 126]] into [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]].  It came into its current form by 1939.

** The above is in question as US Dept. of The Interior Topo Maps from 1943 show Route 27 concurrent with [[U.S. Route 20 (Massachusetts)|US 20]] from [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]] Center to Concord Road in [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]], then following Concord Road to [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]] Center, where it resumed it's current alignment on Hudson Road. Further research is needed.
