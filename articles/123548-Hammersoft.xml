'''Missoula''' {{IPAc-en|audio=Missoula.ogg|m|É¨|Ë|z|uË|l|É}}  is a city in the U.S. state of [[Montana]] and is the [[county seat]] of [[Missoula County, Montana|Missoula County]].  It is located along the Clark Fork and Bitterroot rivers in Western Montana and at the convergence of five mountain ranges, thus is often described as being the &quot;Hub of Five Valleys&quot;.  The [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]] put the population of Missoula at 66,788 and the Missoula Metropolitan Area at 109,299.  Since 2000, Missoula has been the second largest city in Montana.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010.census.gov&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn85.html|work=Census 2010 News |title= U.S. Census Bureau Delivers Montana's 2010 Census Population Totals, Including First Look at Race and Hispanic Origin Data for Legislative Redistricting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Missoula was founded in 1860 and named Hellgate Trading Post while still part of Washington Territory.  By 1866, the settlement had moved five miles upstream and renamed Missoula Mills before being shortened to Missoula.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicmissoula.org&quot;/&gt;  The desire for a more convenient water supply to power a lumber and flour mill led to the movement of the settlement to its modern location in 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicmissoula1&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.historicmissoula.org/History/FromtheBeginning/HellGateVillageEra18601865/tabid/193/Default.aspx|title=Hell Gate Village Era (1860-65)|work=Historic Missoula}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mills provided supplies to western settlers traveling along the Mullan Road with Fort Missoula, set up in 1877 to protect the settlers, further stabilizing the economy.  The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883 was coupled with rapid growth and the maturation of the local lumber industry.  An element of prestige could be claimed ten years later when what was already called the City of Missoula was chosen by the Montana Legislature as the site for the new stateâs first university.  Along with the U.S. Forest Service headquarters founded in 1908, lumber and the university would remain staples of the local economy for the next hundred years.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicmissoula2&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.historicmissoula.org/History/FromtheBeginning/TheArrivaloftheRailroad18831893/tabid/195/Default.aspx |title= Arrival of the Railroad (1883-1893)|work=Historic Missoula}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maedc.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, Missoulaâs lumber industry had gradually disappeared, and today the cityâs largest employers are the University of Montana and Missoulaâs two hospitals. The city is governed by a mayor-council government with twelve city council members, two from each of the six wards. In and around Missoula are {{convert|400|acre|ha}} of parkland, {{convert|22|mi|km}} of trails, and nearly {{convert|5000|acre|ha}} of open-space conservation land with adjacent Mount Jumbo home to grazing elk and mule deer during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.missoula.mt.us/index.aspx?NID=157 |title=Missoula, MT - Official Website - Parks &amp; Recreation |publisher=Ci.missoula.mt.us |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is also home to both Montanaâs largest and its oldest active breweries as well as the [[Montana Grizzlies]], one of the strongest [[college football]] programs in the [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I Football Championship Subdivision]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).  Notable residents include the first women in Congress, [[Jeanette Rankin]] and the United Statesâ longest-serving [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] [[Mike Mansfield]].

[[File:Jumbo teepees.jpg|thumb|left|Teepees set up in modern-day Missoula south of the [[Clark Fork River]], facing east]]
Archaeological artifacts date the Missoula Valley's earliest inhabitants to the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago with settlements as early as 3,500 BCE.  From the 1700s until European settlements began a hundred years later, the land was primarily used by populations of the [[Bitterroot Salish tribe|Salish]], [[Ktunaxa|Kootenai]], [[Pend d'Oreilles tribe|Pend d'Oreille]], [[Blackfeet]], and [[Shoshone]] tribes.  Located at the confluence of five mountain valleys, the Missoula Valley was heavily traversed by local and distant native tribes that periodically went to the Eastern Montana plains in search of [[American bison|bison]], leading to inevitable conflict.  The narrow valley at Missoula's eastern entrance was so strewn with human bones from repeated ambushes that French fur trappers would later refer to this area as &quot;Porte d' Enfer,&quot; translated as &quot;Hell's Gate&quot;.  Hell Gate would remain the name of the area until it was renamed &quot;Missoula&quot; in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicmissoula.org&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.historicmissoula.org/History/FromtheBeginning/EarlyEarlyMissoula/tabid/192/Default.aspx|title=Early, Early Missoula|work=Historic Missoula}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western exploration to the area began with the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]], which stopped twice just south of Missoula at [[Traveler's Rest (Lolo, Montana)|Traveler's Rest]] (first from September 9â11, 1805, and again from June 30-July 3, 1806) before splitting up on the return journey, with Clark taking the southern route along the [[Bitterroot River]] and Lewis travelling north through Hellgate Canyon on July 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lewisandclarktrail.com/section3/montanacities/missoula/travelerrest.htm|title=Traveler's Rest in Montana on the Lewis and Clark Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tworivershistory.net/meriwether-lewis.html Meriwether Lewis], tworivershistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hell Gate, Montana|Hell Gate Village]] was established just west of Missoula in 1860 by Christopher P. Higgins as a trading post to serve the recently completed [[Mullan Road]], the first wagon road to cross the Rocky Mountains to the [[Inland Northwest (United States)|inland of the Pacific Northwest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historicmissoula.org&quot;/&gt;  The desire for a more convenient water supply to power a lumber and flour mill led to the movement of the settlement to its modern location in 1864.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicmissoula1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Missoula from mt sentinel.jpg|thumb|right|Looking west toward the [[Bitterroot Mountains]] over Missoula from [[Mount Sentinel]]]]
The Missoula Mills replaced Hell Gate Village as the economic power of the valley and replaced it as the county seat in 1866.  The name &quot;Missoula&quot; comes from the [[Salishan languages|Salish]] name for the [[Clark Fork River]], âânmesuletkÊ·ââ, which roughly translates to &quot;place of frozen water&quot; and possibly refers to the ancient [[Glacial Lake Missoula]] once located in the valley.  [[Fort Missoula]] was established in 1877 to help protect further arriving settlers.  Growth accelerated with the arrival of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] in 1883, and the Town of Missoula was chartered the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationmissoula.org/history |title=Missoula History |publisher=Destination Missoula |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten years later, Missoula was chosen as the location of the state's first university, the [[University of Montana]].  The need for lumber for the railway and its bridges spurred the opening of multiple saw mills in the area and, in turn, the beginning of Missoula's lumber industry that would remain the mainstay of the area's economy for the next hundred years.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicmissoula2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maedc.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued economic windfall from railroad construction and lumber mills led to a further boom in Missoula's population.  [[A.B. Hammond]] and [[Copper Kings]] [[Marcus Daly]] and [[William A. Clark]] competed fiercely in the region over lumber share and Missoula investments, and in 1908 Missoula became the district, and later a regional, headquarters for the [[United States Forest Service]], which also began training [[smokejumper]]s in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moffatt&quot; /&gt; 

Logging remained a mainstay of industry in Missoula with the groundbreaking of the Hoerner-Waldorf pulp mill in 1956, which led to subsequent protests over the resultant air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/article_54f565a7-465b-5211-ad82-b048b0340e2a.html Missoula anti-pollution group celebrates its victories], helenair.com&lt;/ref&gt;  By the early 1990s, however, the disappearance of many of the region's log yards, along with legislation, had helped clean the skies dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deq.mt.gov/airmonitoring/citguide/understanding.mcpx Missoula Carbon Monoxide SIP Case History], deq.mt.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of the lumber industry, healthcare, education, and tourism became a more visible part of Missoula's economy.  [[St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center]], founded in 1873, is the region's only [[Level II trauma center]] and has undergone three major expansions since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpatrick.org/index.aspx/About_St_Patrick_Hospital |title=St. Patrick Hospital, Missoula, Montana |publisher=Saintpatrick.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, the University of Montana grew 50% and built or renovated 20 buildings from 1990-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umt.edu/president/people/pastpresidents/dennison/default.aspx |title=George M. Dennison |publisher=Umt.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, the City of Missoula approved its first Open Space Bond, which assures the city will maintain the undeveloped hillsides surrounding the valley.

== Geography ==
[[File:Missoula NASA photo labeled.JPG|thumb|Missoula Valley]]
Missoula is located at {{Coord|46|51|45|N|114|0|42|W|city}} (46.872146, -113.9939982),{{GR|1}} at an altitude of 3,209&amp;nbsp;feet (978&amp;nbsp;m) with nearby [[Mount Sentinel]] and [[Mount Jumbo]] steeply rising to 5,158 ft (1,572 m) and 4,768 ft (1,453 m) respectively.  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|23.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (0.46%) is water.&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|787504}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Approximately 13,000 years ago the entire valley was at the bottom of [[Glacial Lake Missoula]] and as could be expected for a former lake bottom, the layout of Missoula is relatively flat and surrounded by steep hills. Evidence of the city of Missoula's lake bottom past can be seen in the form of ancient wave-cut shorelines that can now be seen as horizontal lines on nearby mountains [[Mount Sentinel]] and [[Mount Jumbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/iceagefloods/d.htm |title=Section D: Background |publisher=Nps.gov |date=1993-02-17 |accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the location of present-day [[University of Montana]], the lake once had a depth of {{convert|950|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/geology/publications/inf/72-2/sec3.htm Glacial Lake Missoula], nps.gov&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork River]] enters the Missoula Valley from the east through Hellgate Canyon after joining the nearby [[Blackfoot River (Montana)|Blackfoot River]] at the site of the former [[Milltown Reservoir Superfund Site|Milltown Dam]].  The [[Bitterroot River]] and multiple smaller tributaries join the Clark Fork on the western edge of Missoula.  The city also sits at the convergence of five mountain ranges: the [[Bitterroot Mountains]], [[Sapphire Mountains|Sapphire Range]], [[Garnet Range]], [[Rattlesnake Mountains]], and the Reservation Divide, thus is often described as being the &quot;Hub of Five Valleys&quot;.
[[File:Missoula Glacial Missoula shorelines on Mount Sentinel.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient wave-cut shorelines can still be seen on the edge of [[Mount Sentinel]].]]
=== Flora and fauna ===
Missoula's location in the Northern Rockies has endowed the region with a typical [[Ecology of the Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountain ecology]]. Local wildlife includes populations of [[white-tailed deer]], [[American Black Bear|black bears]], [[osprey]], and [[Bald Eagle|bald eagles]].  During the winter months, [[Mount Jumbo]] is home to grazing [[elk]] and [[mule deer]], preferred for because of its rapid snow melt due to its steep slope.  The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for [[Sand Martin|bank swallows]], [[Northern Rough-winged Swallow|northern rough-winged swallows]] and [[Belted Kingfisher|belted kingfishers]].  [[Killdeer]] and [[Spotted Sandpiper|spotted sandpipers]] can be seen foraging insects along the gravel bars.  Other species include [[Song Sparrow|song sparrows]], [[catbird]]s, several species of [[warbler]]s, and the [[Pileated Woodpecker|pileated woodpecker]].  The rivers also provide cold, high quality water for native fish such as [[westslope cutthroat trout]] and [[bull trout]].  The meandering streams also attract [[beaver]] and [[Wood Duck|wood ducks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[http://www.ci.missoula.mt.us/DocumentView.aspx?DID=4174 Missoula Conservation Land Management Plan], (2010 June 01).&lt;/ref&gt;

Native riparian plant life includes sandbar [[willow]]s and [[Populus sect. Aegiros|cottonwood]]s with Montana's state tree, the [[Pinus ponderosa|Ponderosa Pine]], also being prevalent.  Other native plants include wetland species such as [[Typha|cattails]] and [[Rhynchospora|beaked-sedge]] as well as shrubs and berry plants such as [[Crataegus|Douglas hawthorn]], [[Prunus virginiana|chokecherry]], and [[Symphoricarpos|western snowberries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  Missoula is also unfortunately home to several [[noxious weed]]s which multiple programs have set out to eliminate.  Notable ones include [[Linaria vulgaris|dalmatian toadflax]], [[Centaurea maculosa|spotted knapweed]], [[Euphorbia esula|leafy spurge]], [[St John's wort|St. John's wort]], and [[Potentilla recta|sulfur cinquefoil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umt.edu/sentinel/ UM Natural Areas: Integrated Plant Management Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
Missoula has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''BSk''), with cold and moderately snowy winters, hot and dry summers, and spring and autumn are short and crisp in between. Winter conditions are usually far milder than much of the rest of the state due to its western position within the state. However the mildness is also induced by the dampness, as unlike much of the rest of the state, precipitation is not at a strong minimum during winter. Winter snowfall averages {{convert|43|in|cm|0}}, with most years seeing very little of it from April to October. Summers see very sunny conditions, with highs peaking at {{convert|84|F|1}} in July. However, temperature differences between day and night are large during this time and from April to October, due to the relative aridity.

== Economy ==
Missoula began in the 1860s as a trading post on the [[Mullan Road|Mullan Military Road]] to take advantage of the road's purpose of being the first route across the [[Bitterroot Mountains]] to the plains of Eastern Washington.  The arrival of [[Fort Missoula]] (1877), the Northern Pacific Railroad (1883), and U.S. Forest Service offices (1877) solidified Missoula's economy with a steady stream of employment.  

Timber demand for the railroad lead to the setting up of numerous saw mills, which were gradually consolidated, and the lumber industry remained important to the Missoula economy for much of the 20th century.

Today, Missoula's economy has diversified with Education, health care, retail, government, and professional services all playing an important part in the economy at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billingsgazette.com/special-section/montana-economy/article_fa31b26e-0acb-11e0-bf37-001cc4c03286.html Missoula economy stands on many legs], billingsgazette.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the [[University of Montana]] is the region's largest employer, while [[St. Patrick Hospital]] and the [[Community Medical Center (Montana)|Community Medical Center]] follow making Missoula the regional medical center.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourfactsyourfuture.org/admin/uploadedPublications/3368_CF09_Missoula.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Missoula is also a regional economic center; as of 2006 one survey showed Missoula as having a primary trade area of 100,086 and a secondary trade area of 93,272.&lt;!-- There has been dispute over these figures before changing, please visit talk page.--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.missouladowntown.com/wp-content/uploads/Missoula-Employment-Analysis-FINAL_Review-Draft12-10-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MAEDC&gt;{{cite web|title=Missoula Area Fall 2006 Statistics|url=http://www.maedc.org/uploads/editor/Fall%202006.pdf|publisher=Missoula Area Economic Development Corporation|accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Montana Department of Labor, the fastest growing occupations for the state as a whole are Forensic Science Technicians, Medical Assistants, Industrial Engineers, Food Prep and Service, and Physical Therapist Assistants.  The fastest growing industries are Administrative &amp; Support Services, Administrative &amp; Waste Services, Arts Entertainment &amp; Recreation, Professional &amp; Business Services, Professional &amp; Technical Services, and Health Care &amp; Social Assistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourfactsyourfuture.org/cgi/databrowsing/localAreaProfileQSResults.asp?selectedarea=MISSOULA+COUNTY&amp;selectedindex=33&amp;menuChoice=localAreaPro&amp;state=true&amp;geogArea=3004000063&amp;countyName=&amp;submit1=View+Local+Area+Profile Montana Workforce Informer, Labor Market Info], ourfactsyourfuture.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Downtown Missoula pic.jpg|thumb|left|Caras Park]]
A system of public parks was developed in Missoula in 1902 with the donation of 42 acres along the the Rattlesnake Creek for Greenough Park.  Today the city boasts over 400 acres of parkland, 22 miles of trails, and nearly 5000 acres of open-space conservation land that make activities such as skiing, hiking, biking, and golf available throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;Abdelrahman Magdi&lt;/ref&gt;  Located at the confluence of three rivers (the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork]], [[Bitterroot River|Bitterroot]], and [[Blackfoot River (Montana)|Blackfoot]]), the area is also popular for [[Rafting|white water rafting]] and, thanks largely to the [[A River Runs Through It (novel)|novel]] and subsequent [[A River Runs Through It (film)|film]] ''A River Runs Through It'' by Missoula-native [[Norman Maclean]], is well-known for it's [[fly fishing]].  Additionally, Missoula has two aquatic parks, multiple golf courses, is home to the [[Adventure Cycling Association]], and hosts what [[Runner's World]] called the &quot;best overall&quot; marathon in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton |first=Michelle |url=http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-239-582--13416-5-1X2X3X4X5-6,00.html |title=Marathons to run in 2010 from Runner's World |publisher=Runnersworld.com |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runwildmissoula.org/ |title=Run Wild Missoula |publisher=Run Wild Missoula |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Caras Park, located just south of the historic [[Wilma Theatre]] downtown, was created as a result of a land reclamation project, and with its centralized, waterfront location has become the hub of Missoula's festivities including ''Out to Lunch, the International Wildlife Film Festival, First Night Missoula, Garden City BrewFest'' and offered intimate concert settings for artists such as [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel ]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Santana]], [[Ziggy Marley]], and [[B.B. King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.missouladowntown.com/about/caras-park/ |title=Caras Park |publisher=missouladowntown.com |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Located next to Caras Park is [[A Carousel for Missoula]], a wooden, hand-carved and volunteer-built carousel.

Missoula is governed via the [[mayor-council]] system. There are twelve members of the [[city council]] who are elected from one of six wards. Each ward elects two council members. The mayor is elected in a citywide vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.missoula.mt.us/DocumentView.aspx?DID=461 |title=City of Missoula Charter |publisher=ci.missoula.met.us |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its state legislative delegation is the second largest in the [[Montana Legislature]] and is represented by districts 91-100 in the [[Montana House of Representatives]] and districts 46-50 in the [[Montana Senate]].  Having 14 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and one [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in its state legislative delegation, Missoula is known as a more [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] area than the rest of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcps.k12.mt.us/portal/Default.aspx?tabid=771 |title=Missoula area legislators |publisher=Missoula County Public Schools |date= 2011|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Missoula County was one of only six Montana counties to vote for John Kerry.  That same year Missoula voted in favor of the state's [[Medical cannabis in the United States#Montana|medical marijuana law]] by the largest margin (73%-23%) and the [[Same-sex marriage law in the United States by state#Montana|ban on same-sex marriage]] (which passed in every county) by the lowest margin (51%-49%).  Missoula's Mayor has been John Engen since 2006 and is currently the 50th mayor of Missoula, Montana.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Engen]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidential Election Voting Trends ===
However, though Missoula is the largest liberal-leaning county, it is not the most liberal county in Montana.  That title belongs to [[Deer Lodge County, Montana|Deer Lodge County]] which has not voted for a Republican Presidential candidate since 1924 when [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert LaFollette]] chose Democratic Montana Senator [[Burton K. Wheeler]] as his running mate on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive Party]] ticket and split the Democratic vote.  [[Silver Bow County, Montana|Silver Bow County]], with a similar voting record (with the exception of a a 146 Eisenhower victory in 1956) is a close second.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.americanpast.org/voting/interactive/&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Missoula's  more liberal tendencies are relatively recent development with the county voting at least 6% more for the Democratic candidate than the rest of the state since 1980 (this excludes 2000 where Ralph Nader received 15% of the county's vote).  In fact, only since 1988 (excluding 2000) has the Democratic candidate received more votes than the Republican candidate.  (It should be noted, however, that over 30% of Missoula County's population lives outside the city of Missoula).  Before this, Missoula voted very closely with the rest of Montana or, actually, heavier Republican.

Missoula's left-leaning political culture often leads to the city to be one of the first in the state to enact progressive legislation.  Notable legislation includes...
* 2006 - ''Marijuana'' - Voters in Missoula County passed Initiative 2, which made marijuana possession the lowest priority for law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.co.missoula.mt.us/initiative2/ |title=Missoula County Initiative No. MCSO2006-02 Community Oversight Committee |publisher=co.missoula.mt.us |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coincidentally, Missoula also has an eponymous marijuana strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weedstrain.com/missoula/ |title=Missoula â Marijuana Strain Information and Pictures |publisher=Weedstrain.com |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2007 - ''Urban Chickens'' - Missoula City Council approved an ordinance allowing more chickens in city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.missoula.mt.us/DocumentView.aspx?DID=1028#Chapter_6_12 |title=6 |publisher=Ci.missoula.mt.us |date=1989-09-01 |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2007 -''Withdraw from Iraq'' - Voters passed a referendum asking Congress to have the United States enforce an orderly withdrawal from the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/missoula-approves-withdrawal-referendum/article_22f985d5-3bf9-5c4f-9b05-e047b6473d89.html Missoula approves withdrawal referendum]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* 2010 - ''Non-discrimination Ordinance'' - Missoula City Council approved a non-discrimination ordinance, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression in employment, housing, and public accommodations, thus making Missoula the first city in Montana to pass such an ordinance.
* 2011 - ''Corporations are not People'' - Voters passed a resolution calling on the U.S. Congress and state leaders to amend the U.S. Constitution to say that &quot;corporations are not human beings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/article_7b7a1db4-0b04-11e1-bb3c-001cc4c03286.html Missoula voters say corporations are not people, ask for constitutional amendment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Missoula's first school was opened in 1869 with 16 students from around the region and Emma C. Slack as their teacher who had come via a two-month trip by horseback, railroad, and boat at the invitation of her brother.  Upon marriage to W.H.H. Dickinson she was required to quit teaching as married women were not allowed to teach, and was replaced by Elizabeth Countryman would later marry (1871)  Judge Frank H. Woody who would become Missoula's first mayor in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortmissoulamuseum.org/minutes.php |title=The Historical Museum at Fort Missoula Â» Missoula History Minutes |publisher=Fortmissoulamuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first public high school was opened in 1904, but was quickly overran with students and was converted back to a grade school when the Missoula County High School, designed by A.J. Gibson, was opened in 1908.  Expansions were made, but in 1951 it was decided that another campus was needed, and a new school was opened in 1957.  Initially the two campuses separated between upper and lower classmen, but in 1965 they became two separate schools.  By student vote, the original Missoula County High School became [[Hellgate High School]] and the new campus became [[Sentinel High School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/article_3ad379a0-abb0-53d4-be2a-f4edefdacfc8.html Hallowed halls: Missoula high school celebrates 100 years and two names], missoulian.com&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, Missoula became the first city in Montana to have four secondary schools when it Big Sky High School was established.  Missoula's forth secondary school is  [[Loyola Sacred Heart High School]], a private Catholic school created from a merger in 1974 of the all-girls Sacred Heart Academy (est. 1873) and the all-boys Loyola High School (est. 1911).&lt;ref&gt;http://test.missoulacatholicschools.org/library/Forms%20and%20Documents/Fall%20Newsletter%202010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher Education===
Higher education in Missoula is dominated by the main campus of [[University of Montana â Missoula|University of Montana]].  The university, established in 1893 is the first and largest (15,642 students in 2010) university in Montana. The campus houses 6 colleges (Arts &amp; Sciences, [[University of Montana Phyllis J. Washington College of Education and Human Sciences|Education]], [[University of Montana College of Forestry and Conservation|Forestry]], Health Professions &amp; Biomedical Sciences, and Visual &amp; Performing Arts) and 3 schools ([[University of Montana School of Business Administration|Business]], [[University of Montana School of Journalism|Journalism]], and [[University of Montana School of Law|Montana's only Law School]]). Also located in Missoula is the [[University of Montana College of Technology]] which was established in 1956 and known as the Missoula Vocational Technical Center until it became affiliated with the University of Montana in the Fall of 1994.

Missoula is also home to several vocational schools not affiliated with a university education.  These include The Rocky Mountain School of Photography, Connole-Morton Insurance School, The Dickinson Lifelong Learning Center, [[Osher Lifelong Learning Institutes|The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at UM (MOLLI) (non-credit)]], Modern Beauty School, Montana Academy of Skin Care, Montana School of Massage, and Sage Truck Driving School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makeitmissoula.com/community/education/specialty-schools/ Missoula Specialty Schools], makeitmissoula.com&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Media ==
{{Main|Media in Missoula, Montana}}
Broadcast:  Missoula's television media market has been the largest in the state of Montana since 2002 and ranked #166 nationally (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvjobs.com/cgi-bin/markets/market2.cgi |title=Nielsen Media 2010-2011 Local Market Estimates |publisher=Tvjobs.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Missoula itself is second in population to [[Billings, Montana]], Missoula's media market includes all of [[Missoula County, Montana|Missoula]], [[Ravalli County, Montana|Ravalli]], [[Granite County, Montana|Granite]], [[Mineral County, Montana|Mineral]], [[Lake County, Montana|Lake]], [[Flathead County, Montana|Flathead]], and [[Sanders County, Montana|Sanders]] Counties in the more densely populated western region of Montana and serves over 113,000 television homes (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dishuser.org/TVMarkets/Maps/montana.gif |title=MT television market map |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/public%20factsheets/tv/2010-2011%20DMA%20Ranks.pdf |title=Nielsen TV Market Estimates |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missoula is home to three local affiliate channels: [[KPAX-TV]] (CBS/MTN, The CW; founded 1970; channel 8), [[KECI-TV]] (NBC; founded 1954 as KGVO-TV; channel 13, and [[KTMF]] (ABC, FOX; founded 1991).  Also based in Missoula at the [[University of Montana]] is [[Montana PBS]] (founded 1984; channel 11).   There are also 4 AM and 17 FM radio stations licensed in the city ([[Media in Missoula, Montana#List of broadcast stations in Missoula|List of Stations]]).

Print:  Missoula has four main sources of print media: the ''[[Missoulian]]'' (primary daily), ''[[Missoula Independent]]'' (alternative weekly), ''[[Montana Kaimin]]'' (college), and ''New West'' (digital, progressive).  The ''Missoulian'' was founded as a weekly publication in 1870 as the ''Missoula &amp; Cedar Creek Pioneer''.  It was converted to a weekly and changed to the current ''Missoulian'' in 1891 by the founder of the Missoula Mercantile Co., [[A. B. Hammond]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Honor L. &quot;Missoula, Montana&quot; The Coast. Seattle. The Coast Publishing Company. 08- 1909. Vol. 12, No. 6. (Dec. 1906).&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, the ''Missoulian'' remains Missoula's most popular newspaper with a circulation of over 26,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondonewspapers.com/usa/circulation/montana.html |title=Montana Newspaper Circulation Data |publisher=Mondonewspapers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the third most read newspaper in Montana behind the ''[[Billings Gazette]]'' and the ''[[Great Falls Tribune]]''.  The ''Missoula Independent'' (founded 1991) is the largest weekly newspaper in Montana and the states only member of the [[Association of Alternative Newsweeklies]].  With over 21,000 readers it has twice the circulation of second place ''Billings Outpost''. The newspaper is distributed free to more than 600 locations across Western Montana from [[Hamilton, Montana|Hamilton]] in the south to [[Whitefish, Montana|Whitefish]] in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/AboutUs/Page |title=Missoula Independent &amp;#124; About Us |publisher=Missoulanews.bigskypress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Montana Kaimin'' (founded 1891) is likewise distributee free throughout parts of Missoula with heavy student traffic from the [[University of Montana]] where the newspaper is printed M-F during the school year.  ''New West'' was founded in 2005 as a left-leaning &quot;next-generation media company&quot; that focused on culture, environment, economy, and politics in the Rocky Mountain West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newwest.net |title=New West in Transition |publisher=Newwest.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== City layout and development ===
{{See also|Buildings and structures in Missoula, Montana}}
[[File:Higgins Block - Missoula.jpg|thumb|left|Higgins Block in Downtown Missoula]]
In the mid-1860s C.P. Higgins and Francis Worden began plotting what would become the town of Missoula along the [[Mullan Road|Mullan military road]] which followed the northern bank of the Clark Fork River.  This road, known today in downtown Missoula as Front Street, intersected by Higgins Avenue which in 1873 added a bridge to cross to the southern side of river.  This intersection became the default center of the city, and today is still the numerical center regarding street addresses.  The arrival of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] in 1883 led to a housing boom along the tracks, particularly on the northern side where many of the railway workers would reside.  When the Higgins Avenue Bridge was replaced in 1893 there was debate of whether the bridge should continue angled toward the Bitterroot Valley as it had earlier or straight across so as to be oriented north and south.  Attorneys W.M. Bickford and W.J. Stephens had already laid out plots of land five years earlier for what they hoped would be a new town of &quot;South Missoula&quot; that were perpendicular to the Bitterroot Wagon Road while Judge Hiram Knowles who owned the land just south of the river preferred the north-south plan and did not want to become part of South Missoula anyway.  The result was a 7x14 block area along the west side of Higgins Avenue commonly referred to as the ''Slant Streets'' centered along what is now Stephens Avenue.  Stephens Avenue and Brooks Street are the only arterials to traverse the city diagnolly along with the Bitterroot Branch of [[Montana Rail Link]].  The rest of the city with the exception of Downtown, where streets follow the angle of the river, and newer expansions into the hills strictly follow the [[grid plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortmissoulamuseum.org/minutes.php |title=The Historical Museum at Fort Missoula Â» Missoula History Minutes |publisher=Fortmissoulamuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the establishment of the [[University of Montana]] in 1893 and the announcement that the now-defunct [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]] would be located south of the river houses began to spread quickly throughout the university and south side districts.  The area near the university was promoted as high-end and soon luxurious homes appeared on Millionaires Row on Hammond (now Gerald) Avenue.  &lt;ref&gt;Mathews, Allan James. Montana Mainstreets: A Guide to Historic Missoula. vol 6 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of Interstate 90 in the mid-1960s forced the removal of 60 homes, including the Greenough Mansion.  The north side of Missoula became isolated between the Interstate and the tracks while the Greenough Mansion was moved to a South Hills golf course and converted to a restaurant.  This dichotomy has prevailed with the North Side feeling neglected by the city and the South Hills becoming the city's new upscale region.  With the release of the latest Missoula Downtown Master Plan in 2009 increased emphasis was directed toward redeveloping the North Side's former rail yard and the area just south of the tracks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.missouladowntown.com/wp-content/uploads/MissoulaDowntownMasterPlanFINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Missoula's oldest commercial district, ''Downtown'' is also home to over 30 buildings listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] beginning in 1976 with the [[A.J. Gibson]] designed [[Missoula County Courthouse|County Courthouse]] constructed in 1908 being added.  The [[United States Post Office (Missoula, Montana)|Post Office]], Wilma Theatre and Higgin's Block were all added a couple years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montanahistorywiki.pbworks.com/w/page/21639764/National%20Register%20-%20Missoula |title=National Register of Historic Places: Missoula County |publisher=Montanahistorywiki.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicmissoula.org/History/Architecture/tabid/208/Default.aspx  Architecture], Historic Missoula&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1970s businesses fled Downtown for cheaper land in Southwest Missoula.  This created a second commercial district focused around the ''Southgate Mall'', built in 1978.  A subsequent deterioration of Downtown ironically saved its future.  With old buildings too expensive to replace and no big businesses moving in rents began to fall.  This led to the myriad of small start-up shops in historic buildings that Downtown is known for today.  The area went from bankrupt to the center of Missoula's arts and culture in matter of 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://missoulian.com/uncategorized/downtown-turnarounds/article_9c0f7bf2-285c-5e7e-a9db-0e0f8ac3e35e.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://missoulian.com/news/a-city-revitalized/article_c683daef-bae6-5ffe-bb53-0aaf6ed6d401.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1990s North Reserve Street became the new center for large retail stores.  Located at the cross streets of Highway-93 and the old Mullan Road with easy access to Interstate 90, the area has become a major shopping destination for both local and regional customers.

Overall, the city is officially divided into eighteen neighborhood councils of which all Missoula residents are a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.missoula.mt.us/index.aspx?NID=269 |title=Missoula Neighborhood Councils |publisher=Ci.missoula.mt.us |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city further contains ten historical districts: [[Downtown Missoula]], East Pine Street, [[Fort Missoula]], Lower Rattlesnake, McCormick, Missoula County Fairgrounds, Northside, Southside, University Area and, the [[University of Montana#Campus|University of Montana Campus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicmissoula.org/Tours/HistoricDistricts/tabid/274/Default.aspx Historic Districts], Historic Missoula&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, as the primary city of the Missoula Metropolitan Statistical Area, all other communities within [[Missoula County, Montana|Missoula County]] also being part of said area.

[[St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center]] was founded in 1873 under the sponsorship of the [[Sisters of Providence]] and is the only [[Level II trauma center]] in the region and has undergone three major expansions since the 1980s.  The name was changed from &quot;St. Patrick Hospital&quot; to &quot;St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center&quot; to reflect an increasing involvement with national medical research and education.  The hospital has 195 acute-care beds, and in 2003 admitted over 9,700 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saintpatrick.org/index.aspx/About_St_Patrick_Hospital |title=About St. Patrick Hospital |publisher=saintpatrick.org |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Community Medical Center (Montana)]] and its adjacent medical facilities are situated on a grassy plain near historic [[Fort Missoula]] and is part of a modern complex that includes a nursing home, the Missoula Crippled Children's Center and private offices. It was founded in 1922 as Thorton Hospital by Dr. Will Thornton and Dr. Charles Thornton.  It has been at its current location since 1972 and is the only facility providing obstetrical and newborn care in Missoula County in addition to being the only hospital in western Montana that has a separate Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitymed.org/History |title=N |publisher=communitymed.org }}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Transportation ===
==== Air Travel ====
The [[Missoula International Airport]] (Johnson-Bell Field) is a public airport run by the Missoula County Airport Authority and is the largest airport in western Montana, serving 575,584 passengers in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Betsy Cohen of the Missoulian |url=http://missoulian.com/news/local/article_e36f321a-241e-11e0-b9bf-001cc4c03286.html |title=Missoula airport saw record number of passengers in 2010 |publisher=Missoulian.com |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current building contain three boarding gates ((3 jet bridges, 3 ground-level), offers year-round direct flights to 7 destinations ([[Denver International Airport|Denver]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis]], [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport|Phoenix]], [[Salt Lake City International Airport|Salt Lake City]], and [[SeattleâTacoma International Airport|Seattle]]) and seasonal flights to 3 others ([[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]], [[Portland International Airport|Portland]], and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]]).  Four airlines operate out of Missoula ([[Allegiant Air]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Horizon Air|Horizon/Alaska Airlines]], and [[United Airlines]]) in addition to the Air Cargo Carriers of [[FedEx Express|FedEx]], and [[UPS Airlines|UPS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flymissoula.com/About_Us/Facts_and_Figures |title=Facts and Figures |publisher=Flymissoula.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airport is also home to Homestead Helicopters and [[Fixed-Base Operator]]s Minuteman Jet Center (an Exxon Mobil Avitat fuel provider), and Northstar Jet (a Phillips 66 fuel provider). 
 
History:  
Missoula's first landing strip was laid out in 1923 south of the university.  An additional strip near the Western Montana Fair Grounds on what is now [[Sentinel High School]] was sold to the county in 1927 at the request of the Missoula chapter of the National Aeronautic Association and would become Missoula's first true airport.  The current airfield is named after that chapter's first president, Harry O. Bell along with mountain flying pioneer Bob Johnson of Johnson Flying Service (now Minuteman Aviation).  The original Garden City Airport was renamed Hale Field in 1935 and would operate as such until closing forever in 1954.  The airport was gradually replaced by the Missoula County Airport opened in 1941 with [[Works Progress Administration|WPA funds]] and the cooperation of the [[United States Forest Service|US Forest Service]] who needed access to an airport.  The new airport was renamed Johnson-Bell Field in 1968 and today serves nearly 600,000 passengers a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flymissoula.com/About_Us/Airport_History |title=Airport History |publisher=Flymissoula.com |date=2008-08-27 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bus system ====
Missoula is served by [[Mountain Line (Montana)|Mountain Line]], a public transit agency created by public vote in 1976 as part of the Missoula Urban Transportation District (MUTD) that began operation in December 1977. Mountain Line operates twelve bus routes  within a {{convert|36|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} area, serving Missoula, East Missoula, Bonner, Target Range, Rattlesnake, Mullan Road, and the airport. Additionally the line has offered paratransit services since 1991 to assist the disabled, senior van since 2008, and has four park-n-ride lots throughout Missoula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainline.com |title=Mountain Line |publisher=Mountain Line |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special bus service is offered to the University of Montana through three of city's park-n-ride lots in addition to late-night UDASH shuttle that offers service to [[Downtown Missoula|Downtown]].  Bus fair for university students is prepaid as part of the university's transportation fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.umt.edu/asum/asum_agencies/Transportation/bus/default.php |title=Buses - The University of Montana |publisher=Life.umt.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missoula is also served by [[Greyhound Lines]], and [[Trailways Transportation System|Rimrock Trailways]] that provide intercity bus transportation to and from Missoula.

Interstate 90 runs east to west along the northern edge of Missoula at the base of the North Hills.  All but a small portion of the city (the Upper and Lower Rattlesnake neighborhoods) is located south of the highway.  Completed in 1965 at the expense of 60 homes, the Garden City Brewery and the Greenough Mansion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmcdc.org/history.html |title=History of Missoula's Northside and Westside neighborhoods |publisher=NMCDC |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Missoula portion of [[Interstate 90 in Montana#Missoula, Granite and Powell Counties|Interstate 90]] has five exits: Exit 96 - connection to U.S. 93 North and MT 200, Exit 99 (Airway Boulevard) - access to [[Missoula International Airport]], Exit 101 (Reserve Street) - connection to U.S. 93 South, access to west Missoula, and I-90 Business Loop, Exit 104 (Orange Street) - access to [[Downtown Missoula]], and Exit 105 (Van Buren Street) - access to the [[University of Montana â Missoula|University of Montana]], connection to U.S. 12 South, and I-90 Business Loop.

[[File:US 12.svg|30px|link=U.S. Route 12]] -- [[U.S. Route 12]] -- 
US 12 enters Montana at [[Lolo Pass (Idaho-Montana)|Lolo Pass]], {{convert|7|mi}}  southwest of [[Lolo Hot Springs, Montana|Lolo Hot Springs]] in the [[Lolo National Forest]] before meeting with [[U.S. Route 93|US 93]] at [[Lolo, Montana|Lolo]] and continuing as a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] northeast for {{convert|7.5|mi}} to Missoula.  Here U.S. 12 breaks off U.S. 93 and continues Northeast to [[Downtown Missoula]] along Brooks Street before cutting through the University District and across the Madison Street Bridge.  U.S. 12 joins [[Interstate 90 in Montana|Interstate 90]] East at Exit 105 (Van Buren Street) and overlaps I-90 for {{convert|69|mi}} , until reaching [[Garrison, Montana|Garrison]].

The original U.S. 12 was approved by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHO)]] in 1939 to extend into Wyoming and Montana.  The route, would not include Missoula, however, until U.S. 12 was rerouted along State Route 6 in October 1959.  In 1962, the route was extended from Missoula southeast toward Idaho along U.S. 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us12.cfm |title=U.S. 12 Michigan to Washington - Highway History - FHWA |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:US 93.svg|30px|link=U.S. Route 93]] -- [[U.S. Route 93]] -- 
U.S. 93 enters Montana from Idaho at Lost Trail Pass and travels north descending through the [[Bitterroot National Forest]]. The highway continues along the Lewis and Clark trail into the  [[Bitterroot Valley]] until it joins [[U.S. Route 12|U.S. 12]] at [[Lolo, Montana|Lolo]] as a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] northeast for {{convert|7.5|mi}} to Missoula.  The highway runs along Reserve Street on the western edge of Missoula before meeting Interstate 90 at Exit 101 and following it before breaking off north at Exit 96.  The highway was approved by [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHO]] in 1927 beginning at the Canadian International Boundary through Missoula and exiting Montana near Gibbonsville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us93.cfm |title=U.S. 93 Reaching For The Border - Highway History - FHWA |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rail ====
Missoula has not has passenger rail service since 1979 when [[Amtrak]] discontinued its [[North Coast Hiawatha (Amtrak)|North Coast Hiawatha]] route which ran through southern Montana along present-day Interstates 90 and 94. The North Coast Hiawatha was operated by Amtrak from 1971â1979 and had replaced the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] that had serviced Missoula since 1883. In 2008 a bill was passed in Congress that would require Amtrak to study the North Coast Hiawatha route and consider returning service to the area, prompting some to believe that there is a great chance of service restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Tester gets OK for Amtrak route study | url=http://www.helenair.com/articles/2008/02/24/top/55st_080224_amtrak.txt | publisher=''[[Independent Record]]'' | date=24 February 2008 | accessdate=2009-02-03 | first=Noelle | last=Straub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trail System ====
There is a network of bicycle and pedestrian trails throughout the community extending over {{convert|22|mi|km}}.  Primary trails used for commuting in addition to recreation are those following the path of the former [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Railroad]] east-west along the [[Clark Fork (river)|Clark Fork River]] and southeast along the Bitterroot Branch Railroad.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.ci.missoula.mt.us/Maps%20and%20Graphics/Parks%20and%20Rec/Trails/mapside11-9-final_s2_web-small.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;
