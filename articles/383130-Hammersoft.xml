'''California State University, Long Beach''' (also known as '''Cal State Long Beach''', '''Long Beach State''', '''CSULB''', '''LBSU''', or '''The Beach''') is the second largest [[campus]] of the [[California State University]] (CSU) system and the third largest [[university]] in the state of [[California]] by enrollment.&lt;ref name=csuenrollment&gt;[http://www.calstate.edu/as/stat_reports/2009-2010/f09_01.htm CSU | AS | Term Enrollment Summary]&lt;/ref&gt; The University is located at the southeastern coastal tip of [[Los Angeles County]], less than one mile from the border with [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=W+Campus+Dr+%26+E+State+University+Dr,+Long+Beach,+CA+90840&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1 Map]&lt;/ref&gt;

CSULB has been recognized repeatedly as one of &quot;America's Best Value Colleges&quot; by the ''[[Princeton Review]]''. More than 30 factors are considered to rate the colleges in four categories: academics, tuition GPA (the sticker price minus average amount students receive in gift aid scholarships and grants), financial aid (how well colleges meet students' financial need) and student borrowing.  The university attained its highest ranking in the 2007 edition: the No. 3 best value public college in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bestvalue07&quot;&gt;The Beach Review, Spring 2006: [http://www.csulb.edu/misc/beachreview/archives/2006/spring/noteworthy.htm Princeton Review Ranks Cal State Long Beach No. 3 Best Value Public College in the United States].

==History==
[[Image:Los Angeles-Orange County State College.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The original location of Los Angeles-Orange County State College.]]
  
The College was established in 1949 by California Governor [[Earl Warren]], to serve the rapidly expanding post-[[World War II]] population of [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and Southern [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] counties. Since then, CSULB has grown to become one of the state's largest and most well respected universities.

The institution was first known as ''Los Angeles-Orange County State College''. It offered 25 courses, taught by 13 faculty members, in two apartment buildings at 5381 Anaheim Road in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]. In June 1950, the citizens of Long Beach voted overwhelmingly to purchase {{convert|320|acre|ha}} as a permanent campus for the college, then known as ''Long Beach State College''. The purchase price was nearly $1,000,000. Student enrollment grew rapidly in this new, permanent location.

By 1960, the student body exceeded 10,000 students, and by 1966, 20,000. In 1964, LBSC changed its name to ''California State College at Long Beach'' to conform to the state system and enhance its prestige (it was renamed ''California State College, Long Beach'' in 1968).

In 1965, CSCLB hosted the first [[International Sculpture Symposium]] to be held in the [[United States]] and the first such symposium to be held at a college or university. Six sculptors from abroad and two from the United States created many of the monumental sculptures present on the campus. The event received national media attention from newspapers around the country, including the ''[[New York Times]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]] Magazine'', ''[[Art in America]]'' and a six-page color spread in ''[[Fortune Magazine]]''.

The school acquired [[university]] status in 1972, along with 12 other state college campuses. The promotion was decided by the Board of Trustees of the [[California State University]] system, according to total enrollment, size of graduate programs, complexity and diversity of majors and number of doctorates held by faculty at each college. CSCLB thus became ''CSULB''.

Also in 1972, the campus became the home of the largest library facility in the then 19-campus [[California State University|CSU]] system: a modern six-story building with a [[seating capacity]] of nearly 4,000 students.

In 1995, President [[Robert Maxson]] initiated the privately-funded President's Scholars Program, providing selected qualified California high school [[valedictorian]]s and [[National Merit]] finalists and semi-finalists with a full four-year scholarship package, including tuition, a book stipend, and housing. {{As of|2010|May}}, over 1000 students have accepted the scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;http://karl.papubs.csulb.edu/news-events/story.cfm?hackid=1014&lt;/ref&gt; For applicants for Fall 2010, National Achievement Program Semifinalists/Finalists and National Hispanic Recognition scholars were also considered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csulb.edu/divisions/students/presidents_scholars/application_process/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008|September|alt=As of Fall 2008}}, CSULB had 37,890 students in attendance, making it the most populous campus of the CSU system.

==Campus==
The campus spans {{convert|323|acre|ha}} across 84 buildings, and is located {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It has its own U.S. Postal [[Zip code]]: 90840. CSULB is located at 1250 Bellflower Boulevard. It is bounded by East 7th Street to the south, East Atherton Street to the north, Bellflower Boulevard to the west, and Palo Verde Avenue to the east.

===Architecture===
The architecture of the campus is mostly of the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] (designed primarily by noted architect [[Edward Killingsworth]]) and is very minimalist, placing emphasis instead on the landscaping that surrounds it. This naturalistic, park-like layout has earned the campus numerous design awards, as well as other awards from gardening societies. Recent construction maintains the characteristic glass-and-brick style. The integration of landscaping and architecture is apparent at the school's theater complex, where a dense grove of [[ficus]] trees is planted in such a way that it forms a continuation of the pillar-supported canopy at the theater's entrance. The University's registration offices are located in the open courtyard of Brotman Hall, which is &quot;roofed&quot; by a similar jungle-like canopy. The Psychology building is also notable for its soaring, airy courtyard planted with tall [[Eucalyptus]] trees.

===Campus landmarks===
[[Image:Walter Pyramid.jpg|right|thumb|275px|The [[Walter Pyramid]], the University's most prominent sporting complex and most recognizable landmark.]]

The '''University Student Union''' (USU) building is located at the center of campus. The three-story glass building occupies roughly {{convert|180000|sqft|m2}}, housing numerous offices, and offering more casual attractions, including a study lounge, a ballroom, a food court, a bowling alley, an arcade, and a movie theater.

49er basketball and volleyball games are currently played in the iconic, eighteen-story '''[[Walter Pyramid]]''' (formerly known as the Long Beach Pyramid) located on north campus. The Pyramid is a state-of-the-art sporting complex that can accommodate over 5,000 fans, including temporary seating and standing room. Two sections of interior stands are fitted with large [[hydraulic]] lifts which can lift the seating elements forty-five degrees into the air, creating room for five volleyball courts or three basketball courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;pyramid&quot;&gt;[http://www.longbeachstate.com/local/facilities/pyramid.html The Walter Pyramid]. ''Long Beach State Athletics.'' Retrieved August 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Pyramid is home to the [[Southern California Summer Pro League]], a noted showcase for current and prospective NBA basketball players.

The '''University Art Museum''' (UAM) ranks in the top 10% of the nation's over 6,000 museums. Its permanent collection contains primarily abstract expressionist paintings, works on paper, and an outdoor sculpture garden that began in 1966. The UAM was the first accredited museum in the [[California State University|CSU system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Melrod| first = George | title = University Galleries: Los Angeles Region | journal = art ltd. | page = 45 | publisher = Lifescapes Publishing, Inc. | date = January/February 2010 | issn = 1941-8558|url=http://www.artltdmag.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1262633830&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=28&amp;|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the museum's Gordon F.

The campus is also home to the '''[[Carpenter Performing Arts Center]]''', a 1,074-seat theater named after CSULB alumni [[The Carpenters|Richard and Karen Carpenter]].

The '''[[Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden]]''' is an artistic retreat of solitude and beauty. Among its many picturesque attractions, The Garden features a large pond populated with [[koi]].

One of the newest areas that has become integral to student life in the Parkside dormitories is The Circle. The Circle was formed as part of the central landscaping of the Parkside Commons outdoor common area when a group of students moved the 4 'S' shaped stone benches residing there into a circle formation in the Fall of 2008. Since then, The Circle (also known as the Late Night Circle, due to its high concentration of nighttime denizens) has become the defining marker of the Parkside experience, and it continues to provide a fun hangout for the residents of Parkside Commons.

===Puvunga===
The campus is believed to be the location of an ancient [[Tongva people|Tongva]] village and burial site known as [[Puvunga]], and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. CSULB has challenged this designation, claiming they were not consulted when the application was filed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} From 1992 to 1995, when the university attempted to build a [[strip mall]] and student housing on the last undeveloped portion of the campus, the Tongva people filed a lawsuit and initiated a protest, which involved physically occupying the land day and night to stave off [[bulldozer]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;puvunga&quot;&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~eruyle/puvudoc_0000_about.html Background on Puvunga and the Sacred Site Struggle]. ''About Puvungna.'' Retrieved August 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future development===
In the Spring of 2007, the student body voted to approve the construction of a student recreation and wellness center on campus. Slated for completion by Fall 2010, the Rec and Wellness Center was planned to be an extensive all-purpose athletic center covering about {{convert|125000|sqft|m2}} on North Campus. Plans included facilities for fitness programs and aerobics classes, courts for volleyball, basketball and badminton, rock climbing walls, an indoor track, a student lounge, and much more.  This program is funded and managed by CSULB's Associated Students, Incorporated. This project has been completed and had its first opening the week before the fall semester of 2010.&lt;ref name=readysetrec&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asirecreation.org |title=ASI Recreation |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Fall 2010 semester, CSULB received 79,715 applications for admission, by far the highest total in school history and continuing the increasing trend of recent years. The total also was the highest in the [[California State University|CSU]] system, as well as one of the highest among all universities in the nation. The campus also had the highest number of first time freshman and transfer applicants in the CSU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cf.papubs.csulb.edu/news-events/story.cfm?hackid=1276 CSULB Receives Record Number of Undergraduate Applications] ''CSULB News and Events'' Retrieved 9/9/09&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing number of applications, the lack of state funding due to California's continuing budget crisis meant that CSULB could only offer admission to 25,142 (31.5%) of the applicants; that again marked the lowest percentage in school history. In turn 8,920 (35.5%) of those offered admission did in fact enroll, meaning the total application yield rate for the Fall 2010 semester was 11.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;apps2&quot;/&gt;

For the Fall 2011 semester, Initial reports indicate that CSULB received 70,536 applications, once again topping all other campuses in the CSU system. While the total number of applications dropped by over 9,000 from the previous year, the number of first-time freshman applicants grew by over 2,000 to 49,764. And even though the number of transfer applicants dropped to 20,039, it was still only the second time in school history that the number topped 20,000. In light of further anticipated state budget cuts, school officials declined to speculate on how many offers of admission would be made.

===Campus publications===
[[Image:Csulb-sign.jpg|left|thumb|300px]]

The university has two student publications: the ''Daily 49er''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daily49er.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Union Weekly''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lbunion.com/&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly ''The Long Beach Union Newspaper''). The first issue of the ''Daily 49er'', the campus newspaper, was published on November 11, 1949. It publishes Monday through Thursday during the fall and spring semesters, and once weekly during the summer sessions. It was one of the first college newspapers in the country to have an Internet edition, starting in August 1994.

The ''Union Weekly'', which is partially student-funded, and affiliated with ASI, publishes every Monday during fall and spring semesters. It began on April 22, 1977, when it was formed in response to the ''Daily 49er''. The ''Union Weekly'' focuses on being an alternative voice on campus and features a satirical section called &quot;The Grunion&quot; (not to be confused with the Long Beach paper the Grunion Gazette). At one time in the early 1980s, the ''Union'' was a daily newspaper, giving heavy competition to the ''Daily 49er''.

===KKJZ 88.1 FM===
The California State University Long Beach Foundation owns the [[KKJZ]] non-commercial broadcast license of 88.1 FM, a [[jazz]] and [[blues]] radio station. Global Jazz, Inc., an affiliate of [[Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters, Inc.]], programs and manages the radio station. [http://www.jazzandblues.org/index.aspx KJAZZ Official Website]

Former student [[Steve Martin]], whose philosophy classes at the university inspired him to become a professional comedian,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;He majored in philosophy at California State University, Long Beach (which Steven Spielberg would attend a few years later). ... 'I was romanticized by philosophy. I thought it was the highest thing you could study. At one point I wanted to teach it.' And then along came Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Austrian philosopher whose Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus redefined and reduced the scope of the discipline. Says Martin: 'As I studied the history of philosophy, the quest for ultimate truth became less important to me, and by the time I got to Wittgenstein it seemed pointless. Then I realized that in the arts you don't have to discover meaning, you create it. There are no rules, no true and false, no right and wrong. Anyway, these were the musings of a 21-year-old kid.'&quot;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,965275,00.html|publisher=[[Time magazine]]|title=Sensational Steve Martin|date=1987-08-24|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Emmy Award]] winner and a [[Disney Legend]].
