}}
'''Eibhlin O'Donnell''' was an elegant, warm-hearted Irish woman. She had met and dated [[Eddie Royle]] in the early 80s, when her job for the [[Ireland|Irish]] tourist board in [[Dublin]] took her to a [[London]] office for a six month stint. Eddie liked her intelligence and sense of fun, and they always had good times together whenever Eibhlin was in London. However, Eddie was temporarily attached to the police PR department, and Eibhlin was committed to her close-knit [[catholic]] family (especially her widowed father and her marijuana-smoking sister Maureen) and so, when Eibhlin's work placement ended, she returned to Dublin and their relationship ended. 

She was first seen in [[Walford]] in January 1991, when Eddie's father, [[John Royle|John]], brought her over to London to visit. Eddie was overjoyed to see her, but the timing of her arrival couldn't have come at a worse time, as upon seeing them together, Eddie's current girlfriend, [[Kathy Beale]], decided to call off their relationship. Eibhlin was now in her mid thirties, and was thinking about settling down. She hoped to rekindle something with Eddie, but he opted to try and win Kathy back instead and so, she returned to Ireland.

When Eddie was badly beaten up by [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] in April that year, Eibhlin returned to Walford to visit him in hospital. It seemed that Eddie's brush with death had made him think twice about settling down, and he decided to ask her to marry him. Eibhlin accepted and in August 1991 she managed to transfer her job to a London office. She moved in with Eddie at [[The Queen Vic]], and the pair began to plan a future together in Walford. A part of Eibhlin was never quite convinced that their marriage would work and they didn't get a chance to put it to the test, as Eddie was murdered in September that year - stabbed to death by [[Nick Cotton]]. A devastated and heartbroken Eibhlin then returned to Ireland and has not been seen since.

Mark discovered that he was HIV positive as well and returned to [[Walford]].

The following year, Gill was diagnosed as having [[AIDS]] and visited Mark to ask if he had been tested for HIV. At first Mark denied that he had the virus but later admitted to her that he was HIV positive. They were never certain which of them had contracted the virus first.

They soon rekindled their relationship and Gill married Mark on 23 June 1992, but she died in a hospice the following day.

Susanna Dawson who played Gill found the experience of playing a person living with and dying from AIDS so intense that she co-produced an educational video based on the subject for use in schools and wrote a book, ''The Gill and Mark Story'', to accompany it.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 1999, ''[[All About Soap]]'' magazine placed Mark and Gill's wedding at number six on their twenty greatest soap weddings list.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatest&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 1999|title=The 20 greatest soap weddings...ever!|journal=[[All About Soap]]|publisher=Attic Futura UK Ltd|issue=1|page=43|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine said &quot;Knowing Gill was so close to dying from AIDS, Mark decided his final act of commitment would be to marry her. Sadly, she died in his arms later that afternoon in what remains one of soap's most tear-jerking weddings of all time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatest&quot;/&gt;

|mother=[[Jackie Wallace (EastEnders)|Jackie Wallace]]
}}
'''Joe Wallace''' was a young, [[homosexuality|gay]] chef who was [[HIV-positive]]. He arrived in [[Walford]] in 1991 and got a job at [[Ian Beale]]'s restaurant, The Meal Machine. He encouraged [[Mark Fowler]] to tell his parents that he was HIV-positive. When Ian discovered that Joe had HIV, he sacked him and disinfected his whole kitchen. Joe then left Walford to live with his parents and was the last person to see [[Eddie Royle]] alive before Eddie was murdered by [[Nick Cotton]]

At the trial of Eddie's murder in 1993 Joe briefly returned as a witness. Joe saved [[Clyde Tavernier]] from being convicted of the crime, by testifying that he saw [[Nick Cotton]] climb down his drainpipe the night Eddie was murdered. This implicated him as a suspect and provided enough reasonable doubt to secure Clyde's release from custody.

His mother wrote to Mark telling him he was dying in a hospice in 1994. Joe's death of HIV shocked Mark, but it was visiting the hospice that led him to meet his future wife, [[Ruth Fowler|Ruth Aitken]].

|daughters=[[Mandy Salter]]
}}
'''Lorraine Salter''' was first seen on-screen in November 1991. [[Pat Evans|Pat]] and [[Frank Butcher]] were going through a bad patch in their marriage and Pat started hanging around seedy pick up joints, where she bumped into Lorraine, who she'd known from her days as a [[prostitute]]. Lorraine managed to cause some problems between Pat and Frank, but seeing Lorraine's sorry existence was enough to make Pat realise that she'd left her promiscuous lifestyle well behind her.  

In March 1992 Lorraine contacted Pat from hospital. She'd been severely beaten by her boyfriend and needed Pat to take care of her 15 year old daughter [[Mandy Salter|Mandy]]. Mandy had been taken into care by the social services in the past, and Lorraine wanted to prevent this from happening again. Pat was initially unwilling to help Lorraine due to her past trouble making, but she eventually relented and Mandy came to stay at the Butchers' B&amp;B. Lorraine was released from hospital the following week, and she abandoned her troublesome daughter in Pat's care. Mandy ended up homeless and sleeping on the streets.

Lorraine never appeared on-screen again, although on [[Christmas Eve]] 1992 she contacted Mandy and told her she was coming to visit. She didn't arrive, so Mandy travelled to her flat on [[Christmas Day]] to reunite. Lorraine wasn't there and Mandy was instead greeted by Lorraine's abusive boyfriend Gary. After getting into a fight with Gary, Mandy fled from her mother's [[tower block]] with [[Mark Fowler]] and had no further contact with Lorraine.
