Torpig circumvents anti-virus applications through the use of [[rootkit]] technology and scans the infected system for credentials, accounts and passwords as well as potentially allowing attackers full access to the computer. It is also purportedly capable of modifying data on the computer.

As of November 2008 it has been responsible for stealing the details of about 500,000 online bank accounts and credit and debit cards and is described as &quot;one of the most advanced pieces of crimeware ever created&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7701227.stm BBC News: Trojan virus steals bank info]&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, a team of security researchers from [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] took control of the botnet for ten days. During that time, they extracted an unprecedented amount (over 70 [[Gigabyte|GB]]) of stolen data and redirected 1.2 million IPs on to their private command and control server. The report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~seclab/projects/torpig/index.html UCSB Torpig report]&lt;/ref&gt; goes into great detail about how the botnet operates.
