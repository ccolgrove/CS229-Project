'''Robert Powell''' (born 1 June 1944) is an English television and film actor, probably most famous for his title role in ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' (1977) and as the fictional [[secret agent]] [[Richard Hannay]]. His distinctive voice has become well known in advertisements and documentaries.

He is also known for his role as Mark Williams in [[BBC One]] medical drama, ''[[Holby City]]'', and in the sitcom ''[[The Detectives]]'' alongside [[Jasper Carrott]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Powell was born in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], the son of Kathleen (nÃ©e Davis) and John Wilson Powell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmreference.com/film/97/Robert-Powell.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Powell was educated at [[Manchester Grammar School]], an [[independent school]] for boys in the city of [[Manchester]] in [[North West England]], and later at the [[University of Salford]]. One of his classmates was [[Sir Ben Kingsley]], another famous actor.

===Career===
Powell took up acting while an undergraduate. He had a small role in the original version of ''[[The Italian Job]]'' playing one of the gang, but had to wait a few years for his first success, playing scientist Toby Wren in the [[BBC]]'s [[science fiction]] series, ''[[Doomwatch]]'' in 1970. Having been at his request killed off in the last episode of the original series, Powell became a pin-up and a household name, following up with starring roles in several BBC serials, including television adaptations of the novels ''[[Sentimental Education]]'' and ''[[Jude the Obscure]]''. He also appeared in the 1975 series ''Looking for Clancy'', based on the [[Frederic Mullally]] novel ''Clancy''.

For several years Powell continued as a television regular, with occasional forays into film, notably as ''[[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]]'' in 1974. He also notably played Captain Walker in the 1975 [[Ken Russell]] film version of ''[[Tommy (film)|Tommy]]''. His role had no lines at all and apart from a few early scenes during the overture with [[Ann-Margret]], he is primarily seen through the mind of his son as played by Barry Winch (Young Tommy) and [[Roger Daltrey]]. In one of those scenes Captain Walker is shown in a [[crucifixion]] pose.

He then played [[Jesus Christ]] in the series ''[[Jesus of Nazareth (miniseries)|Jesus of Nazareth]]'' following a successful second audition with [[Franco Zeffirelli]]. The series had an all star cast, including [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Rod Steiger]] and [[James Mason]]. For this role, Powell was nominated for a [[BAFTA]] award, and collected the ''[[TVTimes]]'' Best Actor award for the same performance. Archive footage of his performance would later be used in [[Michael Moore]]'s documentary, ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]'', although Powell's voice was dubbed off with alternate lines parodying the possibility of Jesus being a capitalist.

In 1975, Powell married his girlfriend, the [[Pan's People]] dancer Babs Lord, quickly and quietly, partly because he was about to start filming for ''Jesus of Nazareth'', and partly to overcome problems if she flew out to see him on location in [[Morocco]]. Both felt it would be easier if they were married.

On 23 November 1977, they had their son, Barney, followed in 1979 by a daughter, Kate.

In 1978, Powell took the leading role of [[Richard Hannay]] in the third film version of ''[[The Thirty Nine Steps (1978 film)|The Thirty Nine Steps]]''. It met with modest success, and critics compared Powell's portrayal of [[John Buchan]]'s character favourably with his predecessors. His characterisation did indeed prove to be enduring, as almost ten years later a television series entitled simply ''[[Hannay (TV series)|Hannay]]'' appeared with Powell back in the role, (although the Buchan short stories on which the series was based were set in an earlier period than ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]''). ''Hannay'' ran for two seasons.

In 1980 Powell appeared in the film ''[[Harlequin (film)|Harlequin]]'' playing the Harlequin of the title who seems to have the power to cure the son of a powerful politician. For this performance, he won the Best Actor Award at the [[Paris]] Film Festival. In 1982, he won Best Actor at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for his role in ''Imperativ''.

Powell then agreed to a request from his old friend and golf partner, comedian [[Jasper Carrott]], taking the part of an incompetent detective in a succession of sketches that formed part of Carrott's television series. ''[[The Detectives]]'' was so popular that it was turned into a [[sitcom]], Powell's first and only venture into this genre.

In 1984, Powell made his [[U.S.]] film debut in ''[[What Waits Below]]'' (as known as ''Secrets of the Phantom Caverns'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Man who played 'Jesus' to make U.S. film debut |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/686431342.html?dids=686431342:686431342&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+27%2C+1983&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=MAN+WHO+PLAYED+'JESUS'+TO+MAKE+U.S.+FILM+DEBUT&amp;pqatl=google |date=October 27, 1983 |accessdate=September 12, 2009 |page=E1 |quote=Six years after making his initial impact on American audiences as the star of Franco Zeffirelli's 1977 television film &quot;Jesus of Nazareth,&quot; British actor Robert Powell has just finished his first American-made film. | first=Roderick | last=Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Powell narrated and co-starred in William C. Faure's popular miniseries ''[[Shaka Zulu]]''...with soccer legend [[Henry Cele]] in the title role. In 1992, he starred in the [[New Zealand]] [[World War I]] film ''[[Chunuk Bair (film)|Chunuk Bair]]'', as Sgt Maj Frank Smith. In 1993-1995, he was the voice actor of Dr. Livesey in ''[[The Legends of Treasure Island]]''.

Nowadays Powell appears in person less often, but his distinctive voice is frequently heard on [[voice-overs]], advertisements, and as a narrator of television programmes such as ''[[Great Crimes and Trials]]'' and ''[[The Century of Warfare]]''. He has also narrated many audio books including ''The Thirty Nine Steps'', abridged versions of many of [[Alan Garner]]'s books, and several abridged novels for 'The Talking Classics Collection'. Powell has also lent his voice to musical works, such as [[David Bedford]]'s album ''The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He also made use of his narrating skills on two rock albums by [[Rick Wakeman]] called ''[[Cost of Living (Rick Wakeman album)|Cost of Living]]'' and The Gospels (1987).

On 29 October 2001 a state-of-the-art theatre named after him was opened at the [[University of Salford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
