Laws is currently serving her fourth term on the Greater Valley Glen Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ValleyGlen.net Official Political Website - Charlotte Laws of Valley Glen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in Valley Glen, California. She is the first [[politician]]&lt;ref&gt;Greater Valley Glen Council members are considered politicians in that they campaign for office, are elected, are part of the city government and make binding decisions regarding taxpayer funds that are entrusted to them. They also fit the official definition of a politician. However, some people would not call them politicians because their decisions are advisory with respect to policy-making, and they receive no compensation for their local political work.&lt;/ref&gt; to run on the platform that she represents all beings in her district, not just the humans whom she maintains are the elite. She publicly promotes moving from a democracy to what she calls an ''[[omniocracy]]'', a government with representation for all living beings.&lt;ref name=Laws1&gt;Laws, Charlotte.[http://www.opinioneditorials.com/guestcontributors/claws_20050315.html &quot;From Democracy to Omniocracy&quot;], Opinion Editorials, March 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
