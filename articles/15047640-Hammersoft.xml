===Favre retirement, reinstatement and trade ===

On March 6, 2008, Favre formally announced his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Glazer |first=Jay |title=Favre has decided to call it a career |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/7870944/Favre-has-decided-to-call-it-a-career |publisher=[[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] |date=2008-03-04 |accessdate=2008-03-04   |postscript=}}{{dead link|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Walker |first=Don |title=Favre retiring, Fox Sports reports |url=http://blogs.jsonline.com/packers/ |publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] |date=2008-03-04 |accessdate=2008-03-04 |postscript= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216044939/http://blogs.jsonline.com/packers/  |archivedate = 2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJ4dh7TkvXFMpdKZU9rITbou7jtwD8V6MH9G0|title=Brett Favre Set to Retire After 17 Years|publisher=Google|agency=Associated Press|date=2008-03-04|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080309130129/http%3A//ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iJ4dh7TkvXFMpdKZU9rITbou7jtwD8V6MH9G0 |archivedate = March 9, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2008/03/04/1/slim/|title=Statement From Packers General Manager Ted Thompson|date=2008-03-04|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110606184135/http://www.packers.com/news/releases/2008/03/04/1/slim/ |archivedate = June 06, 2011|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Favre's [[sports agent|agent]], [[James &quot;Bus&quot; Cook]], stated &quot;Nobody pushed Brett Favre out the door but then nobody encouraged him not to go out that door either. I don't think he had a lot of encouragement to stay, but nobody told him to leave either.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todaystmj4.com/news/local/16214242.html|title=Favre's Agent: &quot;We Found Out Last Night&quot;|publisher=Journal Communications Inc.|accessdate=2008-03-04|date=2008-03-04|agency=Associated Press|author=DeLong, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook also believed that Favre had not gotten the impression from the Packers that they wanted him back. Although Favre stated that he had been willing to play another year, he felt that another season would only be successful if he led his team to another [[Super Bowl]] victory. At his press conference, Favre openly wept about leaving the NFL. He stated that his decision, regardless of what was being said in the media, had nothing to do with what the Packers did or didn't do.  He said, seemingly contradictory to Cook's statements, that his decision to retire was based on the fact that he didn't want to play anymore.  He said during the conference, &quot;I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. And that's really what it comes down to.&quot;  But since he had to make his decision right there and then he felt that he needed to retire. He will be eligible for the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 2013. The Packers plan to retire Favre's No. 4 jersey during their regular season opener against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] on September 8.

Favre has stated that if the Packers asked him to return in an emergency situation, that &quot;it would be hard to pass up.&quot; He stressed, however, that he would only return if he was in shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last= |first= |title=Favre Would Help Packers if Needed |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=4624327 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2008-04-24 |postscript= }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 2, 2008, it was reported that Favre was in contact with the Packers about a possible return to the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mortensen |first=Chris |title=Favre has 'itch' to ditch retirement, report to camp |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3471189 |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2008-07-02 |accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 11, 2008, Favre sent a letter to the Packers asking for his unconditional release to allow him to play for another NFL team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3483521| title=Favre seeks unconditional release from Packers, sources say| date=2008-07-11| accessdate=2008-07-11| publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Packers general manager [[Ted Thompson]] announced he would not grant Favre an unconditional release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3484473|title=Packers GM, coach say team won't release Favre despite request|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-07-16|date=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaffirmed the organization's commitment to [[Aaron Rodgers]] as its new quarterback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/15/AR2008071502113.html|title=Favre Says He's Tempted to Show Up at Packers Camp|author=Chris Jenkins|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2008-07-16|date=July 15, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating matters is Favre's unique contract giving him the leverage to void any potential trade by not reporting to the camp of the team he might be traded to if the Packers elect to go that route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d8094bd7a&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true| title=Favre now owns a unique no-trade clause| date=2008-07-15| accessdate=2008-07-22| publisher=NFL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Favre spoke publicly for the first time about his potential comeback in a July 14, 2008 interview with [[Greta Van Susteren]] on the [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[On the Record with Greta Van Susteren]]''.  In the interview, Favre said he was &quot;guilty of retiring early,&quot; that he was &quot;never fully committed&quot; to retirement, and that he was pressured by the Packers to make a decision before the [[NFL Draft]] and the start of the [[Free agent#NFL usage|free agent signing period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3486775| title=Favre to Fox News: Packers should let me play elsewhere| date=2008-07-14| accessdate=2008-07-14| publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Favre disputed the notion that he doesn't want to play for Green Bay and said that while he understands the organization has decided to move on, they should now allow him to do the same.   He made clear that he would not return to the Packers as a backup and reiterated his desire to be released rather than traded, which would allow him the freedom to play for a competitive team.  Favre also accused the Packers of being dishonest, wishing the team would have been straightforward with him and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/football/nfl/07/14/favre.foxnews.ap/index.html| title=Favre shares his side of the story in Fox News interview| date=2008-07-14| accessdate=2008-07-14| publisher=CNNSI.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080717050026/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/football/nfl/07/14/favre.foxnews.ap/index.html  |archivedate = 2008-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second part of the interview, which aired on July 15, Favre expressed his frustration with Packer management, spoke of his sympathy for successor [[Aaron Rodgers]]' predicament, and affirmed he is 100 percent committed to playing football in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;greta&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,383881,00.html|title=Exclusive: Brett Favre on His Packer Replacement and Playing Again|author=|publisher=FoxNews.com|accessdate=2008-07-16|date=July 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of July 16, 2008, Favre's agent, [[James &quot;Bus&quot; Cook]], has stated Favre has &quot;no definite plans to seek reinstatement&quot; and that &quot;It's [the Packers] move.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nodef&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3491920|title=Favre has no definite plans to apply for reinstatement|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-07-16|date=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook reasoned that applying for reinstatement at this time would give Green Bay the opportunity to activate Favre, relegate him to a backup role he is unwilling to accept, and fine him $15,000 a day for failing to report to training camp.&lt;ref name=nodef/&gt;

[[Fox Sports (USA)|FOXSports]].com's [[Jay Glazer]] reported on July 16, 2008, that the Packers filed tampering charges against the [[Minnesota Vikings]] with the league office, alleging improper communication between Vikings offensive coordinator [[Darrell Bevell]] and Favre,&lt;ref name=&quot;glazer&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8351554/Source:-Packers-say-Vikings-tampered-with-Favre|title=Source: Packers say Vikings tampered with Favre|author=Jay Glazer|publisher=FOXSports.com|accessdate=2008-07-16|date=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; although one source suggested that Favre may have been in contact with Vikings head coach [[Brad Childress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tampering&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3493559|title=Vikings refuse to address Packers' claims of Favre tampering|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-07-17|date=July 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After an investigation, Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] ruled there had been no violation of tampering rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;notampering&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-vikings-favre&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns|title=Goodell says Vikings didn't tamper on Favre|author=Jon Krawczynski|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|accessdate=2008-08-06|date=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Favre formally filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29, 2008, and his petition was granted by Commissioner Goodell, effective August 4, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3517219|title=NFL grants Favre reinstatement; sources say QB job is open|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-08-03|date=August 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Favre then flew to Green Bay to report to Packers training camp.  After a lengthy meeting with head coach [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]] and general manager Ted Thompson, however, both sides agreed it was time for Favre and the organization to part ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;partways&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3520925|title=Sources: Favre has spoken to Bucs and Jets as potential trade suitors|author=|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-08-06|date=August 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McCarthy sensed Favre wasn't in &quot;the right mind-set&quot; to resume playing for the Packers, while Favre felt that his relationship with Packer management had deteriorated to the point that a return to the team would be untenable.&lt;ref name=partways/&gt;

After the Packers entered into trade discussions with both the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[New York Jets]], Favre was traded to the Jets on August 6, 2008 for a conditional draft pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8381934/Packers-trade-Favre-to-Jets |title=Packers trade Favre to Jets |accessdate=2008-08-06 |author=Jay Glazer |last= |first= |authorlink=Jay Glazer |date=2008-08-06 |work=Fox Sports on MSN |quote=The month-long saga has finally come to an end, with the Packers agreeing to trade their future Hall-of-Fame quarterback to the New York Jets, FOXSports.com has learned. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp08/news/story?id=3522971 Jets set for Brett: Packers legend headed to New York - NFL - ESPN]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training camp===

The Packers held their training camp sessions at [[Clarke Hinkle Field]] across the street from [[Lambeau Field]]. Practices were moved inside the [[Don Hutson Center]] during inclement weather. [[St. Norbert College]] served as the team base for all living arrangements for the 51st consecutive season. Players were expected to report on July 27, and practices commenced the following day and continued through August 27. Throughout the thirty one day span, seventeen included public practices. For the third straight year, night practiceswere again a part of the training camp schedule under Head Coach Mike McCarthy. Seven night practices, all beginning at 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., were scheduled.

During the first day of practice, [[Brett Favre]] did not file his reinstatement papers and did not appear at camp. Favre told GM [[Ted Thompson]] he would give him a couple of days to work out a trade before he reported. The only player on the active roster absent was RB [[Ryan Grant]] who is currently going through a contract dispute. All of the 2008 draft class was signed by the start of camp and participated.

After the first day McCarthy stated that he thought the evening practice was sloppy, as the morning practice was. There again were many penalties before the snap. That's no surprise on Day 1, though. &quot;As a whole, I thought the pad level was high on both sides of the ball. I thought the footwork was sloppy. It looked like we were in mud at times. So, we'll look at the film.&quot; The pace of the practice was excellentâ14&amp;nbsp;minutes ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;TC1D&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/ic/blogs/insider/2008/07/evening-practice-is-under-way.html|title=Evening practice is sloppy, toolimit|publisher=greenbaypressgazette.com|accessdate=2008-07-28|date=2008-07-29|author=greenbaypressgazette.com Beat Writers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the evening practice on July 29, the Packers got word that [[Brett Favre]] had submitted him papers for reinstatement.

On Wednesday July 29 [[ESPN]]'s [[NFL Live]] was broadcasting from Packers camp. Much of the broadcast circled around Brett Favre's return to football with minor focus on [[Aaron Rodgers]] performance as well as [[Ryan Grant]] and his current contract holdout situation.

Thursday the Packers did not have a formal practice but the team was addressed in the afternoon by former White House press secretary [[Ari Fleischer]]. During the late afternoon, it was reported by ESPN that [[Brett Favre]] had chartered a flight to Green Bay and would arrive later in the day in time to attend camp on Friday. After a series of delays, the flight was canceled and Favre did not fly to Green Bay.

On Saturday August 2 it was announced that [[Ryan Grant]] came to terms with a four-year deal that could be worth as much as $30 million dollars. [[Ryan Grant]] was in attendance for the 2008 Family Night scrimmage on Sunday August 3 but did not participate. A few hours before the scrimmage had taken place, quarterback [[Brett Favre]] was officially reinstated by [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Roger Goodell]] and landed in [[Wisconsin]].

On Monday August 4 [[Brett Favre]] was officially added to the Packers active roster and it was announced that he would now compete against [[Aaron Rodgers]] for the Packers starting quarterback job. After a long conversation with [[Mike McCarthy (American football)|Mike McCarthy]] over the next couple of days, McCarthy felt that Favre wasn't committed to the team and they began working out a trade.

After Brett Favre was traded to the [[New York Jets]], new starting quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] became the target of heckling by a few disgruntled fans at training camp for the next couple of days.

After the Packers pre season game on August 11, it was apparent that second string rookie quarterback [[Brian Brohm]] was in danger of being passed on the depth chart by another rookie quarterback, [[Matt Flynn]] due to Brian's lack of success in the pre season contest.

Another camp battle that had emerged is one between rookie offensive guard [[Josh Sitton]], [[Daryn Colledge]] and [[Allen Barbre]] for the starting left guard spot. Josh Sitton replaced right guard [[Jason Spitz]] in training camp due to Spitz being moved over to center in place of the injured [[Scott Wells]]. Sitton played so well in camp and in the first pre season game that he is now still taking reps with the first string offense at left guard even after the return of center Scott Wells.

====Family night scrimmage====

On August 3 Lambeau Field held a full pads inter-team scrimmage that was delayed by rain and lightning. The scrimmage finally started around 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. CST in front of 56,600 in attendance.

Head Coach Mike McCarthy has talked about the defense being the starting point and common thread that will run through the team in 2008, and on Sunday night, several members of the secondary made an impact. &quot;As a whole, I thought their production was outstanding,&quot; McCarthy said of the defense. &quot;I really thought they flew to the ball. It looked to me, from not studying it, it looked like they did a good job with the bump at the line of scrimmage, disrupting the routes. I thought the defense had a very good night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;famnight&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2008/08/03/2/|title=Family Night Notebook: Secondary Looks Sharp  | publisher=Packers.com |accessdate=2008-08-04|date=2008-08-03|author=Fanning, Tom|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080902064514/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2008/08/03/2/ |archivedate = September 02, 2008|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Rookie cornerback [[Pat Lee (American football)|Pat Lee]] led the team with four passes defensed, Cornerback [[Tramon Williams]], who missed a good part of practice this week with a hip flexor injury, was back on the field and posted two pass breakups, both on third-down plays. Safety [[Charlie Peprah]] made his presence felt with three tackles and a pass breakup, as well as one of the bigger hits of the night. Safety [[Aaron Rouse]] posted the lone takeaway of the night when he intercepted a desperation heave by Rodgers to the back of the end zone intended for Jennings as time ticked away in the two-minute drill.&lt;ref name=&quot;famnight&quot;/&gt;

One area that impressed on Sunday night was the punt return game for the Packers. Rookie wide receiver Brett Swain was credited with two returns for 80&amp;nbsp;yards, including a 66-yarder. He wasn't the only player to post a big play during the special teams work, with cornerback Will Blackmon recording a 56-yard return. Also, Punter [[Jon Ryan]] averaged 54.8&amp;nbsp;yards on his four punts.&lt;ref name=&quot;famnight&quot;/&gt;

Most of the team participated with exception to recently{{When|date=February 2011}} re-signed running back [[Ryan Grant]], corner back [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] and corner back [[Charles Woodson]]. All three were healthy but did not participate. [[Brett Favre]] also was not in attendance due to the fact that he was just reinstated back into the NFL earlier in the day.

Six other players did not participate due to injury. This list included defensive tackles [[Justin Harrell]] (knee) and [[Ryan Pickett]] (back), running back [[DeShawn Wynn]] (concussion), corner back [[Condrew Allen]] (knee), center [[Scott Wells]] (trunk) and defensive end [[Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila]] (knee).&lt;ref name=&quot;famnight&quot;/&gt;

On the retry, [[Mason Crosby]] kicked the ball out of bounds again but this time it was much farther down field. The ball was then placed at the Colts 45&amp;nbsp;yard line but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved the ball back to the Colts 30&amp;nbsp;yard line. On the Colts first drive, they seemed to be able to move the ball very well with runs by the injured starter  [[Joseph Addai]]'s replacement [[Dominic Rhodes]] paired with a 9-yard pass to TE [[Dallas Clark]]. After a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on CB [[Tramon Williams]] on 3rd and 1 at the Colts 39, QB [[Peyton Manning]] connected with WR [[Reggie Wayne]] for a 15-yard gain on the next 3rd down to the GB 16&amp;nbsp;yard line. RB [[Dominic Rhodes]] rushed the ball four consecutive times and capped the drive with a 3-yard rush for the touchdown. The Colts took the 7-3 lead with 4:06 left in the 1st.

The Packers second drive of the game started with a [[Aaron Rodgers]] pass left to [[Greg Jennings]] for 14&amp;nbsp;yards under soft coverage. Ryan Grant continued rushing the ball better with a nice 7-yard gain on the next play to the Green Bay 41&amp;nbsp;yard line. Rodgers failed to connect on a pass deep to [[Greg Jennings]] on the next play but CB [[Tim Jennings]] was flagged for pass interference resulting in a 25-yard penalty down to the Colts 34&amp;nbsp;yard line. After a couple of short runs by [[Ryan Grant]], Rodgers completed a 7-yard pass to [[Greg Jennings]] on 3rd and 6 for the first down. After a Colts neutral zone infraction penalty and a couple more short rush attempts by [[Ryan Grant]], The Packers first touchdown of the game was scored on a 12-yard pass to TE Donald Lee. With a little more than 14&amp;nbsp;minutes left in the 2nd quarter, the Packers took the 10-7 lead.

The Colts continued to attempt to move the ball on their next drive with runs and short passes to the running backs and tight ends but their drive stalled near midfield when [[Peyton Manning]] completed a pass to WR [[Marvin Harrison]] a-yard short of the first down. It appeared that the Colts were going to keep their offense on the field and go for it on fourth down and 1 but Colts coach [[Tony Dungy]] thought otherwise and [[Peyton Manning]] left the field with a look of disagreement with his coaches decision.

After the punt the Packers offense started their third drive of the day at the Green Bay 11. The Packers quickly got out of the shadows of the goal post with a 24-yard pass to WR [[Donald Driver]] to the 35&amp;nbsp;yard line. After a short 3-yard gain by [[Ryan Grant]] and two 3-yard receptions by [[Donald Driver]], the Packers were faced with a 4 and 1 at their own 44&amp;nbsp;yard line much like the Colts on their previous drive. Instead of punting like the Colts did, the Packers kept their offense on the field a managed to get the first down on a nice 7-yard rush by [[Ryan Grant]]. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 33&amp;nbsp;yard line with a few short runs by [[Ryan Grant]] mixed with a short pass to RB [[Brandon Jackson (running back)|Brandon Jackson]] for 9&amp;nbsp;yards. On 2nd a 7 Rodgers dropped back to pass and looked to throw to WR [[Greg Jennings]] but decided to dump the ball off the [[Brandon Jackson (running back)|Brandon Jackson]] for the second time on the drive but he was tackled for a 1-yard loss. During the play a flag was thrown for illegal use of the hands on CB [[Tim Jennings]] who was coving [[Greg Jennings]] on the play. After a rush for no gain on 1st down at the Colts 28, Rodgers connected with WR [[Ruvell Martin]] for 17&amp;nbsp;yards to the Colts 11&amp;nbsp;yard line. The Packers scored their second touchdown of the day on the next play with an 11-yard rush by [[Ryan Grant]]. The Packers now held a 17-7 lead with 2:53 left in the half.

Now in a ten point hole, The Colts offense took the field again but could not manage to get a first down. DT [[Ryan Pickett]] batted down the pass intended for [[Marvin Harrison]] on 3rd down and forced the Colts to punt.

With 1:54 remaining in the half the Packers started their final drive of the half on their own 33&amp;nbsp;yard line. The drive featured many short passes to RB [[Brandon Jackson (running back)|Brandon Jackson]] for decent gains along with a Rodgers scramble down the middle of the field for a 9-yard gain. The Packers moved the ball down to the Colts 18&amp;nbsp;yard line and took a time out with 9&amp;nbsp;seconds left. [[Mason Crosby]] attempted a 36-yard field goal but the kick was pushed wide left. The half ended with [[Peyton Manning]] taking a knee and the Packers went in the half with a 17-7 lead.

The Colts started the second half with possession and managed to move the ball to the Packers 48&amp;nbsp;yard line, but a pass to [[Reggie Wayne]] on 3rd and 6 went through his hands and popped up into the air. FS [[Nick Collins]] who was a couple yards behind Wayne was in perfect position to intercept the ball and returned it 62&amp;nbsp;yards for the touchdown to take the commanding 24-7 lead early in the 3rd.

After the interception return the Colts offense took the field and managed to move the ball down to the Packers 28&amp;nbsp;yard line with a 29-yard pass to TE [[Dallas Clark]]. After a 1-yard rush and two incomplete passes the Colt's [[Adam Vinatieri]] attempted a 45-yard field goal but it was blocked by DT [[Johnny Jolly]].

The Packers took over possession but failed to move the ball and was forced to punt. During the punt, Colts [[Tim Jennings]] was flagged for defensive delay of game and the Packers were awarded 5&amp;nbsp;yards and a 1st down. The Packers then managed to move the ball down to the Colts 11 with some short gains on the ground by [[Ryan Grant]]. The highlight of the drive took place when FB [[Korey Hall]] received a pass from [[Aaron Rodgers]] and hurdled over the on coming defender. The drive ended when [[Ryan Grant]] couldn't get past the 1st down marker on 3rd down and they had to settle for a successful 29-yard field goal by [[Mason Crosby]] to extend the lead to 27-7.

The Colts managed to get a first down off an illegal contact penalty on 3rd down, but the drive ended with three incomplete passes by [[Peyton Manning]]. The Colts punted and the Packers ended the 3rd quarter with 2 rushes by [[Ryan Grant]]. The first play of the 4th was an incomplete pass to TE [[Tory Humphrey]] and the Packers were forced to punt for the first time of the contest.

The Colts again couldn't move the ball on their next possession and were forced to punt, The Packers took over and gain one first down on a pass to [[Brandon Jackson (running back)|Brandon Jackson]], but they failed to break into Colts territory and punted for the second time of the contest.

With time not on the Colts side, the Colts drove down all the way to the Packers 5&amp;nbsp;yard line and were looking to score. Manning forced a throw into triple coverage in the end zone to [[Dallas Clark]] earlier in the drive and it was almost intercepted by [[Charles Woodson]] but S [[Aaron Rouse]] batted the ball down before Woodson could secure the pick. Rouse made up for it though 3 plays later when he stepped in front of WR [[Anthony Gonzalez]] at the 1&amp;nbsp;yard line and intercepted the pass. Rouse returned the ball 99&amp;nbsp;yards for the Packers second interception for a touchdown in the game and 5th of the season. With the score the Packers increased their lead to 34-7 with about 4:30 remaining in the game.

In a prevent style defense, the Packers allowed the Colts offense to move down the field to the Green Bay 15. Peyton Manning threw the ball to [[Anthony Gonzalez]] at the goal line and he looked to be in for the score. The booth reviewed the catch and the call on the field was reversed. On the next play, Manning completed another pass to [[Dallas Clark]] and he dove for the pylon for the score. The booth reviewed the touchdown and again the touchdown wasn't awarded but the ball was placed at the 1&amp;nbsp;yard line. RB [[Dominic Rhodes]] rushed 1-yard for the touchdown to decrease the Packers lead to 34-14.

The Colts lined up in an onside kick formation but kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]] instead kicked the ball shallow and it was easily caught by [[Charles Woodson]]. [[Ryan Grant]] rushed for 9&amp;nbsp;yards on 1st down to put him over the 100-yard mark for the first time this season and two [[Aaron Rodgers]] kneel downs sealed the dominating victory.

With the win, the [[Green Bay Packers]] improved their record to 4-3 going into the bye week.
