'''''Big Brother Brasil 10''''' was the tenth season of '''''Big Brother Brasil''''' which premiered January 12, 2010 with the season finale airing March 30, 2010 on the [[Rede Globo]] [[television network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.dihitt.com.br/noticia/big-brother-brasil-10-estreia-no-dia-12-de-janeiro|title =Big Brother Brasil 10 estreia no dia 12 de Janeiro|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The show was produced by [[Endemol|Endemol Globo]] and presented by news reporter [[Pedro Bial]]. The season was officially confirmed since 2008 as part of a millionaire contract between international Endemol and Rede Globo. The prize award was R$1,500,000 without tax allowances.

The winner was 37 year-old  physical education teacher [[Marcelo Dourado]] from [[Porto Alegre]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], who won with 60% of 154.878.460 votes cast, a worldwide record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://contigo.abril.com.br/noticias/dourado-grande-vencedor-bbb-10-544917.shtml|title =Dourado Ã© o grande vencedor do BBB 10|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; He previously appeared on ''[[Big Brother Brasil 4]]'', when he finished in seventh place.

==General==
There were seventeen housemates competing for the grand prize (making this the first season to have an odd number of original housemates), a decrease over the previous season. The season lasted 78 days, a decrease of one week over the previous season.

===The House===
Housemates were accommodated into two houses. The rich house has two rooms, the &quot;Tattoo&quot; and the Head of Household ones, which are no longer mounted on a separate structure of the house. The poor house was built in the area that was once occupied by the Head of Household room. It is actually a big loft, living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. 

The exterior has another corner with a futton, the jacuzzi is closer to the swimming pool; there is a front porch and new furniture, a pool table, plus an option for feedlot distraction. The gym now is in a closed environment with air conditioning. Another novelty is a garage where the famous and dreaded &quot;White Room&quot; - which is just a normal room - that is painted black and white is.

===During the Show===
Big Brother divided the housemates into five cliques of three: Sarados (the Fit), Belos (the Beautiful), CabeÃ§as (the Nerds), Ligados (the Tunned) and Coloridos (the Colorful/Gays). 
The housemates play as individuals except when a housemate from a clique wins Head of Household, then all members of that clique are immune from eviction. This concept was first implemented on the [[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|eleventh season]] of [[Big Brother (U.S.)]]

Five past housemates returned to support one of the cliques in the House: Joseane Oliveira of [[Big Brother Brasil 3|Big Brother 3]] supported the Belos, Marcelo Dourado of [[Big Brother Brasil 4|Big Brother 4]] supported the Sarados, Rafael Valente of [[Big Brother Brasil 6|Big Brother 6]] supported the CabeÃ§as, Fani Pacheco of [[Big Brother Brasil 7|Big Brother 7]] supported the Coloridos and Natalia Casassola of [[Big Brother Brasil 8|Big Brother 8]] supported the Ligados. 

Fernanda won the first HoH competition for the &quot;Belos&quot; allowing Joseane to return to the House as a full housemate and the first Head of Household. Joseane also could choose one of the two male ex-housemates (either Dourado or Rafael) to enter as a full Housemate. She chose Dourado.

===Reunion Show===

The reunion was hosted by Ana Maria Braga and aired on April 5, 2010 on the [[Breakfast television|morning news and talk show]] &quot;Mais VocÃª&quot;. It was first reunion since [[Big Brother Brasil 5|Season 5]] and all the former housemates attended. Actresses [[Deborah Secco]] and [[Betty Lago]], singer [[Preta Gil]], [[Big Brother Brasil 7|Season 7]] winner Diego Gasques and [[Big Brother Brasil 9|Season 9]] runner-up Priscila Pires were special guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://televisao.uol.com.br/ultimas-noticias/2010/03/31/ana-maria-braga-recebe-os-brothers.jhtm|title =Ana Maria Braga recebe os brothers|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Anamara===
A request for exemption was made on January 29, 2010 from housemate Anamara Barreira to the State Military Police &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u686818.shtml|title =Procuradora entra com pedido de exoneraÃ§Ã£o de Anamara da PM|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; was accepted and the decision was published on February 23, 2010 in the Official Gazette of [[Bahia]]. 

Anamara should have returned from her vacation earlier this month. Without the exemption, she would be considered a deserter and could be imprisoned for up to two years. The application was lodged by the procurator of Anamara, Amanda Miller. According to Amanda, Anamara left an attorney before entering the house to the application for exemption from the corporation could be done. With the letter of resignation Anamara could not be considered a defector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u686818.shtml|title =Anamara Ã© exonerada da PolÃ­cia Militar|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dourado===
Dourado caused disagreements and controversies by displaying manjis in a tattoo on his left arm, which were taken to be swastikas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babado.ig.com.br/bbb10/noticias/2010/01/18/bbb10+exibicao+de+simbolo+ligado+a+nazismo+irrita+comunidade+judaica+9355089.html|title=BBB10: ExibiÃ§Ã£o de sÃ­mbolo ligado a nazismo irrita comunidade judaica|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also accused of homophobic behavior by some LGBT organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diversao.terra.com.br/tv/bbb10/noticias/0,,OI4312368-EI14549,00-ABGLT+comunica+Endemol+sobre+caso+de+homofobia+no+BBB.html|title=ABGLT comunica Endemol sobre caso de homofobia no &quot;BBB 10|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dourado's adviser, Aline Antonoff, issued a press release, in which she stated that the tattoo differs from the Nazi swastika, because it is reversed, and has no connection with it, since the symbol belongs to several cultures. She also denied that the fighter is homophobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ofuxico.terra.com.br/materia/bbb/noticia/10/2010/02/26/bbb10-assessoria-de-dourado-se-irrita-com-acusacoes-contra-o-lutador-137863.htm|title=Assessoria de Dourado se irrita com acusaÃ§Ãµes contra o lutador|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-04-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elenita===
After recording a post-elimination interview with Elenita for a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off show]] broadcast by [[Cable television|cable channel]] [[Multishow]], [[Big Brother Brasil 7|Season 7]] winner and main host Diego Gasques criticized the former housemate on his [[Twitter|Twitter account]], commenting that the two had a fight and she was a disgusting and low level woman. Later, he deleted the post, but kept posting sarcastic comments about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u696068.shtml|title =Diego AlemÃ£o diz que Elenita Ã© nojenta e de quinta categoria|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A week after the incident, [[Big Brother Brasil 9|Season 9]] runner-up Priscila Pires took over hosting duties from him to interview the last evicted housemate at the time, AngÃ©lica Marques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u698696.shtml|title =ApÃ³s xingar Elenita, Diego AlemÃ£o deixa de apresentar programa|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housemates==
&lt;!---Nicknames only be placed if the credits for that season billed the contestant by that name. For example, Carlos &quot;Cadu&quot; Parga and Eliane &quot;Lia&quot; Kheireddine should be acceptable, but not Anamara &quot;Maroca&quot; Barreira or Ana Marcela &quot;Massa&quot; Alves. ---&gt;

The cast list was unveiled on January 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://producao.bbb.globo.com/diariodaproducao/2010/01/05/conheca-os-selecionados/|title =Big Brother Brasil 10: ConheÃ§a os participantes selicionados|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2010-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting History==
The voting table below records whom each housemate voted to nominate on the diary room during his or her time in the House. The Head of Household vote (casted in front of the other housemates) automatically nominate one housemate from eviction. Then, the other housemates voting and if the vote is tied, the HOH breaks the tie (this type of vote counts towards the total number of nominations received). 

Big Brother divided the housemates into five cliques: '''&lt;font color=&quot;#E32636&quot;&gt;Sarados&lt;/font&gt;''' &lt;font color=&quot;#E32636&quot;&gt;(Fit)&lt;/font&gt;, '''&lt;font color=&quot;#1C39BB&quot;&gt;Belos&lt;/font&gt;''' &lt;font color=&quot;#1C39BB&quot;&gt;(Beautiful)&lt;/font&gt;, '''&lt;font color=&quot;#03C03C&quot;&gt;CabeÃ§as&lt;/font&gt;''' &lt;font color=&quot;#03C03C&quot;&gt;(Brains)&lt;/font&gt;, '''&lt;font color=&quot;#FFD700&quot;&gt;Ligados&lt;/font&gt;''' &lt;font color=&quot;#FFD700&quot;&gt;(Tuned)&lt;/font&gt;, and '''&lt;font color=&quot;#663333&quot;&gt;Coloridos&lt;/font&gt;''' &lt;font color=&quot;#663333&quot;&gt;(Colorful/Gays)&lt;/font&gt;. When a housemate from a clique wins Head of Household, the other members of the clique are immune from eviction along with the Head of Household. At the end of the week three, the cliques dissolved, leaving all housemates to play on their own.

* [[#fn1|Note 1:]] {{colorbox|#FBF373}} During the first three weeks when a housemate of a clique wins Head of Household, the other housemate of the same clique will also be immune from eviction along with the Head of Household.
 
* [[#fn2|Note 2:]] For winning the first Head of Household competition for Joseane, Big Brother gave an extra immunity to Fernanda.

* [[#fn3|Note 3:]] For winning the Monday's Night Game, Big Brother gave an extra immunity to Lia.

* [[#fn4|Note 4:]] Ana M. answered the Big Phone and was informed that she should choose two housemates (Angelica and Tessalia) to wear red collars until the vote. On Sunday, one of the two would be automatically nominated for eviction. However, she could not receive the vote of either, or she herself would be nominated in their place. Tessalia voted Ana M., then she replaced Tessalia on the nomination.

* [[#fn5|Note 5:]] Anamara answered the Big Phone and was automatically nominated for eviction.

* [[#fn6|Note 6:]] Audience voted Dourado to win the &quot;Higher Power&quot;, he can overthrow the HoH or the house votes or the Big Fone and replace the nominations. This power can only be used once and within the next two evictions. The twist was based on &quot;Coup d'Ãtat&quot; from the [[Big Brother (U.S.)|American Big Brother]].

* [[#fn7|Note 7:]] In the first round of nominations in the fourth week, the two housemates who received the most votes would be nominated alongside with the HoH vote.
 
* [[#fn8|Note 8:]] {{colorbox|#C3B091}} Dourado played his &quot;Higher Power&quot; and overthrow the house votes, so the four votes against him did not count. He had the casting vote and chose EliÃ©ser (who had received his vote above) to replace him on the nomination.

* [[#fn9|Note 9:]] In the second round of nominations in the fourth week, housemates just could vote in a person who lived (that week) in the opposite house. First, the HoH Michel (Poor House) automatically nominated Lia (Rich House), then the other housemates voting (in public, without diary room). The Rich House nominated Uilliam by a 6-1 vote, while the Poor House, nominated Dourado by a 5-0 vote.

* [[#fn10|Note 10:]] Anamara answered the Big Phone and was informed that she should choose two housemates (Dourado and Fernanda) to wear red collars until the vote. On Sunday, the house would give immunity to one of the two choices, and also nominate who did not receive that immunity. Anamara should have keep this as a secret, however, she said some tips about the meaning of the red collars, then Big Brother decided to nominate her as a punishment.

* [[#fn11|Note 11:]] Angelica answered the Big Phone and was informed that she should choose two housemates (Claudia and Sergio) to stay in the White Room together with her. Audience voted for a person who was in the White Room to win immunity, Sergio received the most votes to win the immunity. On Sunday, the house had to choose between send one or two people from the White Room be automatically nominated for eviction. The house chose to send only one person (Angelica).

* [[#fn12|Note 12:]] For winning the Monday's Night Game, Big Brother gave an extra immunity to Dicesar.

* [[#fn13|Note 13:]] Dourado answered the Big Phone and was informed that he should be choose one housemate to be automatically nominated for eviction on Sunday and keep this as a secret. He nominated Claudia and, therefore, he was banned from nominating with the other housemates.

* [[#fn14|Note 14:]] Dicesar answered the Big Phone and was informed that he should choose two housemates (Anamara and Dourado) to stay handcuffed until the vote. On Sunday, one of the two would be automatically nominated for eviction. He nominated Dourado and, therefore, he was banned from nominating with the other housemates.

* [[#fn15|Note 15:]] Lia won the eighth Power of Immunity competition. However, there was a twist (not known by the housemates) in which the winner, rather than immunize another housemate, would be immunized.

* [[#fn16|Note 16:]] Dicesar answered the last Big Phone and received an extra immunity from Big Brother. However, he should keep this as a secret until the vote, or he would lose that immunity.
