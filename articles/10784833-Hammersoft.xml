'''Jeremy Transue''' is an [[United States|American]] [[alpine skier]].  Born June 1, 1983, Jeremy was introduced to skiing at 18 months.  He began racing at age 6 at [[Hunter Mountain (ski area)|Hunter Mountain]], New York, where his father Bruce was Operations Manager.  For high school, he attended the [[Green Valley Mountain School]] in Vermont where he honed his racing abilities.  Later on, he joined the [[United States Ski Team|US Ski Team]] (USST) as a C-Squad member.  However, since the C-Squad is age-capped at 24, Jeremy came under pressure to achieve and move up to B-Squad.  After winning three late-season [[International Ski Federation|FIS]] races in 2007, including the absolute last of the season by a one second margin, &quot;Worm,&quot; as he is known, came through.  A member of the 2007-2008 USST B-Squad, he is currently ranked in the top 100 worldwide in the [[Super-G]] and [[Downhill]] disciplines.  Jeremy is sponsored by the [[Skis Rossignol|Rossignol]] ski company.
