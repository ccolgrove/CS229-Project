'''Active Channel''' is a [[website]] type which was introduced by [[Internet Explorer 4|Internet Explorer 4.0]] in 1997. It allows synchronizing website content and viewing it offline. It makes use of the [[Channel Definition Format]], which is a way of defining a website's content and structure.

Most Active Channels were provided by bigger entertainment companies like [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Warner Bros.|WB]] or [[AOL]] and also made heavy use of [[Dynamic HTML|DHTML (Dynamic HTML)]].

Each country had different channels, so picking a country during the installation of [[Internet Explorer]] 4 (and therefore [[Windows 98]]) was important. Channels could be displayed in a Channel Bar.

Active Channel support has been removed from [[Internet Explorer]] as of version 7 as it had been superseded by the more popular and standards-based [[RSS]] format.
