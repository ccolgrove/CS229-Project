'''Saint Mary's University''' (SMU) is located in [[Halifax (former city), Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] Canada. The school is best known{{by whom|date=May 2011}} for having nationally lead programs in Business, Astronomy and International Development Studies{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} as well, one of the best [[Canadian football|football]] and Men's hockey programs in Canada {{citation needed|date=May 2011}}.

The campus is situated in Halifax's South End and covers approximately {{convert|40|acre|ha|0}}.

== History ==

Founded in 1802 by Reverend Edmund Burke, Saint Mary's is the second oldest English-speaking and first Roman Catholic initiated university in Canada. With meagre resources Burke initiated instruction for young men at Glebe House, located on the corner of Halifaxâs Spring Garden Road and Barrington Street.

The [[Roman Catholic]] church founded St. Mary's University at [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/tlctd10.txt The Project Gutenberg] EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17, 1881&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1841 the Nova Scotia Legislature bestowed the degree granting charter to Saint Maryâs and eleven years later granted the University formal legal status. After a great deal of uncertainty, in 1913 the Christian Brothers of Ireland were asked by the Archdiocese of Halifax to direct the college and academic programs. With this change of leadership the University's reputation thrived as a Liberal Arts Institution and expanded its undergraduate programs, with the most notable being the Faculty of Commerce in 1934 (now known as the Sobey School of Business), which was the first of its kind in Canada. In 1940 the Upper Province of the Society of Jesus (the [[Jesuits]]) was invited to succeed the Christian Brothers as both administrators and faculty.

The next 30 years would see the University flourish under the Jesuit supervision, with such advancements as the formal recognition of the &quot;college&quot; as a University in 1952 and purchasing the first computer in Atlantic Canada (a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]]) in 1959. In 1970 the Jesuits formally incorporated the University under the &quot;Acts of Incorporation&quot; which gave all administrative and academic duties to the Board of Governors and [[Saint Mary's University Academic Senate|Academic Senate]]. Saint Mary's University was established by the Saint Mary's University Act, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smu.ca/ug/documents/UniversityActDec2007.pdf Saint Mary's University Act]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Saint Marys HFX.jpg|thumb|left|Main entrance]]Since then the University has continued expansion of its academic programs with the most notable being the offerings of doctoral level studies in Astronomy and Business and the accreditation of the business school with the AACSB ([[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]]). At the same time the University has expanded its campus facilities with noted additions of the Burke-Gaffney Observatory in the 1970s and the Sobey Building in 1998.

In 1992, the Faculty of Commerce was renamed the [[Sobey School of Business]], after [[Frank H. Sobey]], founder of [[Sobeys]].

In 2001, SMU's Huskies were the first Atlantic Canadian university team to advance to the world finals in the [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] World Finals.

In March 2005, Saint Maryâs started the âScience Building Renewal Projectâ which was estimated to cost $25.5 million. This project is part of the larger project the âUniversityâs Strategic Directions and Academic Planâ which was developed by meeting with Students, Faculty and local Citizens in order to meet both the needs of the University and local community over the next decade. The first stage of the project focused on:
* Modernization and expansion of the Science Facility's resources
* Renew the architectural, mechanical and electrical infrastructures of the Science building and its surroundings
* Provide additional office and research space to every faculty member
* Improve lab layout for hands-on teaching purposes
* Integrate flawlessly with future projects in both function and appearance

The University completed construction of the Atrium and Global Commons project in late 2009. The three-storey $17.5 million dollar complex links the Science Centre, the Burke Building and the Patrick Power Library. The space features a common area, theater style classrooms, offices and study spaces. The project also features advanced green environmental technologies, has fully integrated hard and Wi-Fi systems, a food outlet and a three storey &quot;living wall&quot;.

The 62-year old McNally Building is undergoing a $27 million dollar renewal thanks in large part to the Canadian governments Infrastructure Renewal Programme. Estimated to be completed by March 2011, most of the interior of the 4 floor, 4 wing complex is being rebuilt.

Construction of the new Homburg Centre for Health and Wellness began in October 2010. This complex will house new space for community health and wellness activities and become the new home for the Centre for the Study of Sport and Health. The $8 million project was funded by a donation from real estate developer and manager Richard Homburg and the University's capital campaign.
