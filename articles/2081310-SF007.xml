'''chkrootkit''' ('''Check Rootkit''') is a common [[Unix]]-based program intended to help [[system administrators]] check their system for known [[rootkit]]s.  It is a [[shell script]] using common UNIX/Linux tools like the ''[[strings (Unix)|strings]]'' and ''[[grep]]'' commands to search core system programs for signatures and for comparing a [[Tree_traversal|traversal]] of the '''''[[/proc]]''''' filesystem with the output of the ''[[Ps (Unix)|ps]]'' (process status) command to look for discrepancies.

It can be used from a &quot;[[rescue disc]]&quot; (typically a [[Live CD]]) or it can optionally use an alternative directory from which to run all of its own commands.  These techniques allow chkrootkit to trust the commands upon which it depends a bit more.

There are inherent limitations to the reliability of any program that attempts to detect compromises (such as [[rootkit]]s and [[computer virus]]es).  Newer rootkits may specifically attempt to detect and compromise copies of the chkrootkit programs or take other measures to evade detection by them.
