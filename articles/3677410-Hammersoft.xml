The team set numerous school and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] records, including their 652&amp;nbsp;points which set an NCAA record for points scored in a season.

In the [[2004 Texas Longhorn football team|2004 season]] [[Vince Young]] led the team to the [[2005 Rose Bowl]], the school's first [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) game, and a top 5 finish in the major polls. It should also be noted that Vince Young predicted that the Longhorns would return to the Rose Bowl next season in a post game interview where he proclaimed, &quot;We'll be back!&quot; Young returned for the 2005â2006 season, as did most of the other key players from 2004â2005, with the exception of [[Cedric Benson]], [[Derrick Johnson]], and [[Bo Scaife]]. Texas was given a pre-season No. 2 ranking (behind the defending National Champions, the University of Southern California) by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine, the [[Associated Press Poll]] and the ''[[USA Today]]'' [[Coaches Poll]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Preseason consensus&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://preseason.stassen.com/consensus/2005.html#national | title=2005 Preseason Consensus | work=Stassen.com | publisher=Stassen | accessdate=2006-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 2005, a period free of official team practices, Young and his receivers spent extra practice time working on their timing and team-work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sweed redemption&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=40&amp;url_article_id=2568&amp;url_subchannel_id=&amp;change_well_id=2 | title=Sweed redemption | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher= University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | date=November 1, 2006 | accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[autumn|fall]] Orange and White intra-team [[Exhibition game|scrimmage]] was held on August 21, 2005, as an event open to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orange and White&quot;&gt;UT's colors are [[burnt orange]] and white.

Senior [[Richmond McGee]] made two 33-yard [[field goal (football)|field goals]] and emerged as the top candidate to handle field goals, kickoffs and [[punt (football)|punts]].

Since 1912 the teams have played the game at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] stadium in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]], amid the atmosphere of the adjacent [[Texas State Fair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;news_record&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newsrecord.org/media/storage/paper693/news/2003/11/19/Sports/Column.Rivalries.Spark.College.Football-693841.shtml?norewrite200606152025&amp;sourcedomain=www.newsrecord.org | title=Column: Rivalries spark college football |work=The News Record | publisher=University of Cincinnati | accessdate=2006-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is unusual because most college football games alternate between the opponents home stadiums. Dallas was chosen as the neutral site because it is approximately halfway between the two schools.

The game frequently has implications for the conference and national championship races. Since 1945, at least one of the teams was ranked among the top 25&amp;nbsp;teams in the nation coming into 60 out of 65&amp;nbsp;games. Prior to the 2005&amp;nbsp;game, Texas held an advantage in the all-time series 55â39â5, which included a 43â35â4 edge in Dallas, but Oklahoma had won the 5&amp;nbsp;previous games, including the two worst losses ever for a Texas team in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sooner-stats&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://soonerstats.com/football/series/details.cfm?OppID=7 | title=OU-Texas Football Series | work=SoonerStats.com| publisher=University of Oklahoma | accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those losses had helped build a reputation that Mack Brown was not capable of winning in &quot;Big Games&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;road to Rose clear&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2005/10/13/Sports/Longhorns.Road.To.The.Rose.Bowl.Is.Clear-1432097.shtml?sourcedomain=www.michigandaily.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com | title=Longhorns' road to the Rose Bowl is clear | authors=Geise, John and Kia Hamadanch | work=The Michigan Daily | publisher=University of Michigan | date=October 13, 2005 | accessdate=2007-01-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930201135/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2005/10/13/Sports/Longhorns.Road.To.The.Rose.Bowl.Is.Clear-1432097.shtml?sourcedomain=www.michigandaily.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USA-OSU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MB-OSU&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;coaching debate&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.coversexperts.com/includes/article_ce.aspx?ce=20087&amp;ur=6367 | title=The Great Coaching Debate | author=Sevransky, Ted | work=Covers Experts | publisher=SportsDirect Inc | accessdate=2007-01-17|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071007022015/http://www.coversexperts.com/includes/article_ce.aspx?ce=20087&amp;ur=6367 |archivedate = October 7, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TOTK&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sportsbytes.net/article.asp?articleid=75234 | title=Coach Catharsis | author=Flint, Ross | work=TOTK.com | date=January 5, 2006 | accessdate=2007-01-17| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927045310/http://sportsbytes.net/article.asp?articleid=75234| archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four times during those five years, Texas' loss to Oklahoma prevented them from playing in the Big 12 Conference Championship Game.&lt;ref name=&quot;full plate&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/columnist/weekendforecast/2005-10-05-column_x.htm | title=Full plate of Big 12, SEC showdowns worth feasting on | work=USA Today | publisher=Gannett Company | author=Smith, Erick | date=October 5, 2005 |accessdate=2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these two teams appeared in four of the nine BCS national championship games from 1999 to 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/timeline | title=BCS, Alliance &amp; Coalition Games Year-by-Year | work=BCSfootball.org | publisher=The National Football Foundation &amp; College Hall of Fame, Inc | accessdate=2007-08-29| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070815235347/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/timeline| archivedate = August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of all the teams on Texas regular season schedule, [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] had the best historical record against Texas up to the start of the season.

Texas scored touchdowns on all five of their first&amp;nbsp;half possessions; these included three&amp;nbsp;rushing touchdowns by Vince Young, one&amp;nbsp;rushing touchdown by Selvin Young, and one&amp;nbsp;touchdown pass from Vince Young to Limas Sweed.

The [[Texas Tech Red Raiders]] came into the game undefeated and ranked number 10 in the nation with hopes of beating Texas, winning out the season, and playing for a national championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://texastech.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101705aaa.html | title=Red Raiders Face Texas In Top-10 Showdown | work=CSTV.com | publisher=CSTV Networks, Inc. | date=October 17, 2005 | accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Longhorns scored a field goal on their first&amp;nbsp;possession and Texas Tech answered with a touchdown pass by [[Cody Hodges]]. Texas regained the lead when Henry Melton rushed for a touchdown. In the second&amp;nbsp;quarter, the Red Raiders tied up the game with a field goal before Texas regained the lead with two&amp;nbsp;touchdown runs by Selvin Young and a touchdown pass to Billy Pittman. In the third&amp;nbsp;quarter, the Longhorns extended their lead with two&amp;nbsp;touchdowns to one by Texas Tech. Texas' seventh&amp;nbsp;touchdown came with 6:30 left in the game and it was the last points scored in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tech-box&quot;/&gt;

The BCS formula took into account [[Bowl Championship Series#2004-05 formula|strength of schedule]] so that teams received more credit for beating stronger opponents. This allowed Texas to advance in the rankings since they beat an unbeaten team while [[University of Southern California]], who previously held the number&amp;nbsp;one spot, beat Washington, a 1â6 team.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCS Standings&quot;/&gt;

The week following the Texas Tech game Vince Young said he still planned to return for his senior season in 2006.

Texas place at the top of the BCS rankings lasted only one week. On October 29, 2005, Texas initially trailed but rallied to beat an [[Oklahoma State Cowboys]] team that had held a losing record through the season so far.&lt;ref name=&quot;OkSU-box&quot;/&gt; Texas retained the top spot in the computer rankings, but not by enough to stay ahead of USC in the overall BCS standings.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCS Standings&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=2005 Bowl Championship Series Standings | url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/files/bcs-2005.pdf | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060819231914/http://www.bcsfootball.org/files/bcs-2005.pdf | archivedate=2006-08-19 | work=BCSFootball.org | publisher=The National Football Foundation &amp; College Hall of Fame, Inc | accessdate=2006-07-20 | format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oklahoma State scored first, with a surprising 49&amp;nbsp;yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 as if trying a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21â9 at the end of the first&amp;nbsp;quarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the second&amp;nbsp;quarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28â12 at halftime. The second&amp;nbsp;half was dominated by Texas as they scored five&amp;nbsp;unanswered touchdowns to win the game. The scores consisted of two&amp;nbsp;rushing touchdowns by Vince Young, two&amp;nbsp;rushing touchdowns by Ramonce Taylor, and a 21&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown pass to Neale Tweedie.&lt;ref name=&quot;OkSU-box&quot;/&gt;

Despite Oklahoma State's 0â4&amp;nbsp;start to conference play, they led Texas the entire first half, including a lead of as much as nineteen&amp;nbsp;points. It was the third&amp;nbsp;straight year that Texas trailed Oklahoma State at halftime and came from behind to win by a sizable margin (47â28). Vince Young set a school record for total yards in one game with 506&amp;nbsp;yards (239&amp;nbsp;passing, 267&amp;nbsp;rushing).&lt;ref name=&quot;OkSU-box&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/000_stats/05/ut8.htm | title=Texas vs Oklahoma State | date=October 29, 2005 | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young also became one of only seven&amp;nbsp;players in NCAA history to have accumulated over 200&amp;nbsp;yards rushing and 200&amp;nbsp;yards passing in a single&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCAA record book&quot;/&gt; Over the past three&amp;nbsp;meetings between the two&amp;nbsp;schools (2003â2005), the Longhorns outscored the Cowboys by a combined second-half score of 118â0.&lt;ref name=&quot;all-time results&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=36&amp;url_subchannel_id=&amp;url_article_id=1349&amp;change_well_id=2 | title=All-Time Results | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | date=December 30, 2006 | accessdate=2007-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Longhorns first played the [[Baylor Bears]] in 1901 and have faced them annually since both were members of the [[Southwest Conference]]. In the 95&amp;nbsp;meetings through 2005, Texas' record was 69&amp;nbsp;wins, 22&amp;nbsp;losses, and 4&amp;nbsp;ties.

Texas was stopped on their first drive due to an unsuccessful [[fourth down conversion]]. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's [[Michael Huff]] intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6â0 lead. Texas extended the lead in the second&amp;nbsp;quarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the third&amp;nbsp;quarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourth&amp;nbsp;touchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced right back up into his hands.

In order to win the 2004&amp;nbsp;game against the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas Jayhawks]], Texas had to convert a 4th-and-18&amp;nbsp;situation and complete a touchdown pass with only eleven&amp;nbsp;seconds remaining on the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;2004 Kansas&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://kuathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/111304aaa.html | title=Texas Escapes with a 27â23 Win Over Kansas | work=CSTV.com | publisher=CSTV Networks, Inc. | date=November 13, 2004 | accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2005&amp;nbsp;game provided much less on-field drama, as Texas led 52â0 by halftime and defeated Kansas 66â14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kansas box&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/000_stats/05/ut10.htm | title=Kansas vs Texas (Nov 12, 2005) | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | accessdate=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first&amp;nbsp;quarter, Texas scored touchdowns on a pass to Limas Sweed, a run by Jamaal Charles, a pass to Quan Cosby, and a [[Pancake block|punt return]] by Aaron Ross. In the second&amp;nbsp;quarter, the Longhorns had a touchdown run by Ramonce Taylor and touchdown catches from David Thomas and Peter Ullman. David Pino also kicked a field goal for the Horns. In the third&amp;nbsp;quarter, Kansas opened the scoring with a 59-yard touchdown by [[Jon Cornish]]. Taylor scored another touchdown. UT had the only score of the fourth&amp;nbsp;quarter, a touchdown by Selvin Young.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kansas box&quot;/&gt;

UT fans were unhappy with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s television coverage of the event. The network elected to stick with the Oklahoma vs. Texas A&amp;M game instead of switching to the Kansas vs. Texas game. ABC stayed with the Oklahoma vs. A&amp;M game through the final down and then ran three&amp;nbsp;full minutes of commercials while the Texas vs. Kansas game continued. By the time they switched over Texas was already leading 14â0. The ABC announcers started their coverage saying &quot;And now, we'll join the game you've been waiting for all week, which has pretty much already been decided.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/longhorns/entries/2005/11/12/abc_leaves_ut_fans_watching_ou_and_am.html | title=ABC leaves UT fans watching OU and A&amp;M | work=Austin American-Statesman | publisher=Cox Enterprises | author=Corcoran, Michael | date=November 14, 2005 | accessdate=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC then broke away from their coverage at halftime to broadcast other events. This left thousands of UT fans who assembled to watch the game in Darrell K. Royal â Texas Memorial Stadium stranded without coverage for much of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/longhorns/entries/2005/11/14/kvue_says_abc_made_call_on_joining_longhorn_game_in_progress.html | title=KVUE says ABC made call on joining Longhorn game in progress | work=Austin American-Statesman | publisher=Cox Enterprises | author=Corcoran, Michael | date=November 14, 2005 | accessdate=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lopsided victory allowed Texas to play several less-experienced players. Back-up quarterback Matt Nordgren entered the game in the third&amp;nbsp;quarter, replacing Vince Young. Third-string quarterback Matt McCoy replaced Nordgren just past the mid-point of the fourth&amp;nbsp;quarter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kansas-box&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/000_stats/05/ut10.htm | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | title=Kansas vs Texas | date=November 12, 2005 | accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Colt McCoy]] was listed third on the UT depth chart, television broadcasters referred to Matt McCoy (no relation) as Colt McCoy, a mistake they repeated over the season.

Vince Young, Limas Sweed, David Thomas, and Jamaal Charles scored touchdowns in the second&amp;nbsp;quarter to give the Horns a 42â3 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Selvin Young, Charles and Melton each scored rushing touchdowns. Brandon Foster scored a touchdown on defense due to [[Michael Griffin (football player)|Michael Griffin]] blocking a Colorado punt. Halfway through the third quarter, Texas already had 70 points, but went on cruise control from that point on and did not score again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Big 12 box&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/000_stats/05/ut12.htm | title=Texas vs Colorado (Dec 03, 2005) | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | date=December 3, 2005 |accessdate=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005&amp;nbsp;season marks only the eighth&amp;nbsp;time in 50&amp;nbsp;years that exactly two&amp;nbsp;teams have gone into the bowl season undefeated. This has been a major criticism of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top two&amp;nbsp;teams can generate controversy. If more than two&amp;nbsp;undefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.&lt;ref name=&quot;deeply flawed&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.whatifsports.com/insider/default.asp?article=20061205 | title=BCS Inequities and Solutions | author=Swartz, Elliot | work=WhatIfSports.com | publisher=What if Sports | accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bceaglesfootball.com/bcnotes2005.htm | title=Boston College Football Notes | work=BCEaglesFootball.com | publisher=Boston College | date=January 6, 2006 | accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website of UT football posted a special logo (pictured) proclaiming the Longhorns as the national champions.&lt;ref name=&quot;weblogo&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | title=National Champions | accessdate=2006-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo featured the script &quot;National Champions&quot; centered prominently in the center, with &quot;MACKBROWN-TEXASFOOTBALL.COM&quot; in the lower left and &quot;THE OFFICIAL SITE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS LONGHORNS&quot; in the lower right. In the background was an image of a rose, with a small Longhorn symbol appearing in front of the rose and between the two sections of the smaller print. In the upper right-hand side, the years &quot;1963, 1969, 1970, 2005&quot; appear, with the &quot;2005&quot; given special emphasis. These years correspond to the four consensus national championships won by the UT football team. The special logo was removed from the website's home page after a few months, but as of 2007 it is still found on certain portions of the site related to the 2005 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;web logo&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=40&amp;url_subchannel_id=&amp;url_article_id=1959&amp;change_well_id=2 | title=2005 Schedule/Results | work=MackBrown-TexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
