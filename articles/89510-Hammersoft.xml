The '''University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill''' (also known as '''UNC''', '''UNC-Chapel Hill''', '''Chapel Hill''', '''North Carolina''', or simply '''Carolina''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/content/unc-leaders-want-abbreviation-change|title=UNC Leaders Want Abbreviation Change|last=Wootson|first=Cleve R., Jr|date=2002-01-08|location=Chapel Hill, NC|publisher=''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]''|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[public university|public]] research university located in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]], United States. First enrolling students in 1795, it is one of the multiple schools to claim the title of the [[Oldest public university in the United States|oldest public university in the United States]]. 

All [[undergraduate]]s receive a [[liberal arts]] education and have the option to pursue a major within the professional schools of the university or within the College of Arts and Sciences from the time they obtain junior status. In both teaching and research, UNC has been highly ranked by publications such as ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' and ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. The university forms one of the corners of the [[Research Triangle]] in addition to [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] and [[North Carolina State University]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]].

UNC has a strong history in athletics, most notably in [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|men's basketball]], [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's soccer|women's soccer]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's lacrosse|men's lacrosse]]. The [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] share rivalries with other [[Tobacco Road]] schools and have provided many [[List of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Olympians|olympians]] to [[United States at the Olympics|United States teams]]. The student newspaper ''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]'' has won national awards for collegiate media, while the [[Campus radio|student radio]] station [[WXYC]] provided the world's first internet radio broadcast.

==History==
{{main|History of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill}}
[[Charter]]ed by the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] on December 11, 1789, the university's cornerstone was laid on October 12, 1793, near the ruins of a chapel, chosen because of its central location within the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Snider|first=William D.|title=Light on the Hill: A History of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aKRPWDroJSwC|publisher=UNC Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|year=1992|pages=13, 16, 20|isbn=0807820237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning instruction of undergraduates in 1795, UNC is one of the [[Oldest public university in the United States|oldest public universities in the United States]] and the only such institution to confer degrees in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 29, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=C. Dixon Spangler Jr. named Overseers president for 2003â04|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/05.29/01-spangler.html|publisher=''Harvard University Gazette''|location=Cambridge, MA|date=2003-05-29|accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Governor of North Carolina|North Carolina Governor]] [[David Lowry Swain]] persuaded [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] to exempt some students from the draft, so the university was one of the few in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] that managed to stay open.&lt;ref&gt;Snider, William D. (1992), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] suffered the loss of more of its population during the war than any village in the South, and when student numbers did not recover, the university was forced to close during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] from December 1, 1870 until September 6, 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Battle|first=Kemp P.|title=History of the University of North Carolina: From 1868â1912|url=http://books.google.com/?id=AdshAAAAMAAJ|publisher=Edwards &amp; Broughton Printing Company|location=Raleigh, NC|year=1912|pages=39, 41, 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Old Well.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Old Well]], a symbol of the University, stands at the heart of campus.]]
Despite initial skepticism from university President [[Frank Porter Graham]], on March 27, 1931, legislation was passed to group UNC with the [[North Carolina State University|State College of Agriculture and Engineering]] and the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro|Women's College]] to form the Consolidated University of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 212â213.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the consolidated university was made fully [[coeducational]], although most women still attended [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro|UNCG]] for their first two years, transferring to Chapel Hill as a junior, since freshmen were required to live on campus and there was only one women's dorm. As a result, the Women's College was renamed the &quot;[[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]&quot;, and the University of North Carolina became the &quot;University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNC Trustees in broad changes of all branches|date=1963-01-25|location=Burlington, NC|publisher=''The Daily Times-News''|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=Susan H.|coauthors=Hearn, James C.; Marine, Ginger M.|year=1997|title=State Policy and the Public Research University: A Case Study of Manifest and Latent Tensions|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|publisher=The Ohio State University Press|location=Columbus, OH|volume=68|issue=4|pages=363â397|doi=10.2307/2960008|jstor=2960008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/campus_links/inside_uncg/inside_history.html|title=The History of UNCG|year=2005|publisher=The University of North Carolina at Greensboro|accessdate=2008-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/about-nc-state/history/index.php|title=History|year=2008|work=About NC State|publisher=North Carolina State University|accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, UNC officially desegregated its undergraduate divisions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/unc/uncdesegregation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], UNC at Chapel Hill was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;unorthcarolina-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studentorgs.unc.edu/nrotc/index.php/history |title=The Beginning of NROTC at UNC Chapel Hill |publisher=[[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill |last= |first= |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, the campus was the location of significant political protest. Prior to the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], protests about local [[racial segregation]] which began quietly in [[Franklin Street (Chapel Hill)|Franklin Street]] restaurants led to mass demonstrations and disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Snider, William D. (1992), p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The climate of civil unrest prompted the 1963 [[North Carolina Speaker Ban|Speaker Ban Law]] prohibiting speeches by [[Communism|communists]] on state campuses in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Snider, William D. (1992), p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  The law was immediately criticized by university Chancellor [[William Brantley Aycock]] and university President [[William Friday]], but was not reviewed by the North Carolina General Assembly until 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 272â273.&lt;/ref&gt;  Small amendments to allow &quot;infrequent&quot; visits failed to placate the student body, especially when the university's board of trustees overruled new Chancellor Paul Frederick Sharp's decision to allow speaking invitations to [[Marxist]] speaker [[Herbert Aptheker]] and civil liberties activist [[Frank Wilkinson]]; however, the two speakers came to Chapel Hill anyway. Wilkinson spoke off campus, while more than 1,500 students viewed Aptheker's speech across a low campus wall at the edge of campus, christened &quot;Dan Moore's Wall&quot; by ''[[The Daily Tar Heel]]'' for Governor [[Dan K. Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 274â275.&lt;/ref&gt; A group of UNC students, led by Student Body President Paul Dickson, filed a lawsuit in [[United States federal courts|U.S. federal court]], and on February 20, 1968, the Speaker Ban Law was struck down.&lt;ref&gt;Snider, William D. (1992), pp. 267â268.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1990s onward, UNC expanded rapidly with a 15% increase in total student population to more than 28,000 by 2007. This was accompanied by the construction of new facilities, funded in part by the &quot;Carolina First&quot; fundraising campaign and an [[financial endowment|endowment]] that increased fourfold to over $2&amp;nbsp;billion in just ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://giving.unc.edu/development/endow.htm|title=University Endowment|accessdate=2008-04-05|year=2007|publisher=UNC Office of University Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oira.unc.edu/historical-trends-1978-2000.html|title=Historical Trends, 1978â2007|accessdate=2008-05-20|year=2007|publisher=UNC Office of Institutional Research and Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Oliver Smithies]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 2007 for his work in [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2007/10/09/University/Unc-Professor.Wins.Nobel.Prize-3020317.shtml|title=UNC professor wins Nobel Prize|last=Sullivan|first=Kate|date=2007-10-09|location=Chapel Hill, NC|publisher=''The Daily Tar Heel''|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable [[Leaders of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|leaders of the university]] include the 26th Governor of North Carolina, [[David Lowry Swain]] (president 1835â1868); and [[Edwin Alderman|Edwin Anderson Alderman]] (1896â1900), who was also president of [[Tulane University]] and the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous Presidents and Chancellors|publisher=UNC Office of the Chancellor|year=2008|url=http://www.unc.edu/chan/past.php|accessdate=2008-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current chancellor is [[Holden Thorp]], who earned a bachelor of science degree from UNC in 1986, a Ph.D. in chemistry from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1989, and was a postdoctoral associate at [[Yale University]] from 1989 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu/chan/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

UNC's {{convert|729|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} campus is dominated by two central [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quads]]: Polk Place and McCorkle Place.&lt;ref name=&quot;beautiful&quot;/&gt; Polk Place is named after North Carolina native and university alumnus President [[James K. Polk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/jp11.html|title=Biography of James Polk|accessdate=2008-04-05|year=2001|work=Past Presidents|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; and McCorkle Place is named in honor of Samuel Eusebius McCorkle, the original author of the [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] requesting the university's [[charter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=William S.|title=Dictionary of North Carolina Biography|publisher=UNC Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|year=1991|volume=4|chapter=Samuel Eusebius McCorkle|isbn=9780807819180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adjacent to Polk Place is a sunken brick courtyard known as the Pit where students will gather, often engaging in lively debate with speakers such as the [[Gary Birdsong|Pit Preacher]]. The MoreheadâPatterson Bell Tower, located in the heart of campus, tolls the quarter-hour. In 1999, UNC was one of sixteen recipients of the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] Medallion Awards and was identified as one of 50 college or university &quot;works of art&quot; by T.A. Gaines in his book ''The Campus as a Work of Art''.&lt;ref name=&quot;beautiful&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellertson|first=Shari L.|year=2001|title=Expenditures on O&amp;M at America's Most Beautiful Campuses|journal= Facilities Manager Magazine|volume=17|issue=5|publisher=APPA|location=Alexandria, VA|url=http://www.appa.org/FacilitiesManager/article.cfm?ItemNumber=394&amp;parentid=203|accessdate=2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaines|first=Thomas A.|title=The Campus as a Work of Art|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, CT|year=1991|pages=155|isbn=0275939677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's campus is informally divided into three regions, usually referred to as &quot;north campus,&quot; &quot;middle campus,&quot; and &quot;south campus.&quot; North campus includes the two quads along with the Pit, Frank Porter Graham Student Union, and the Davis, House, and Wilson libraries. Almost all classrooms are located in north campus along with several undergraduate residence halls.&lt;ref name=&quot;campusmap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maps.unc.edu/CampusMaps/PdfMaps/CampusMapIndexed2005_11x17.pdf|title=Campus Map|format=PDF|year=2007|publisher=UNC Engineering Information Services|accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle campus includes [[Fetzer Field]] and [[Woollen Gymnasium]] along with the Student Recreation Center, [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]], Irwin Belk outdoor track, [[Eddie Smith Field House]], [[Boshamer Stadium]], [[Carmichael Auditorium]], Sonja Haynes Stone Center for Black Culture and History, School of Government, [[University of North Carolina School of Law|School of Law]], George Watts Hill Alumni Center, Ram's Head complex (with a dining hall, parking garage, grocery store, and gymnasium), and various residence halls.&lt;ref name=&quot;campusmap&quot;/&gt; South campus includes the [[Dean Smith Center]] for men's basketball, [[University of North Carolina School of Medicine|School of Medicine]], [[UNC Health Care|UNC Hospitals]], [[KenanâFlagler Business School]], and the newest student residence halls.&lt;ref name=&quot;campusmap&quot;/&gt;

A new [[satellite campus]], Carolina North, to be built on the site of [[Horace Williams Airport]] was approved in 2007. This is planned to be primarily a [[science park|research park]] with expanded science facilities, but will also add classrooms and residence halls to cope with future increases in student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/724199.html|title=A primer for Carolina North|date=2007-10-03|location=Raleigh, NC|publisher=''The News &amp; Observer''|accessdate=2008-06-20}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
The principles of sustainability have been integrated throughout much of UNC-Chapel Hill.  In the area of green building, the university requires that all new projects meet the requirements for [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver certification and is in the process of building the first building in North Carolina to receive LEED Platinum status.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNC Sustainability: Buildings&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
UNCâs award-winning co-generation facility produces one-fourth of the electricity and all of the steam used on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNC Sustainability: Energy at UNC&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006, the university and the [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Town of Chapel Hill]] jointly agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 60% by 2050, becoming the first town-gown partnership in the country to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNC Sustainability: Institutionalizing Sustainability&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Through these efforts, the university achieved a âAââ grade on the Sustainable Endowment Instituteâs College Sustainability Report Card 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web
  | title =College Sustainability Report Card 2009

Only 14 out of 300 universities received a higher score than this.

===Old Well and McCorkle Place===
The most enduring symbol of the university is the [[Old Well]], a small neoclassical [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] based on the Temple of Love in the [[Gardens of Versailles]], in the same location as the original well that provided water for the school.&lt;ref name= &quot;landmarks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.unc.edu/exhibits/architecture/the-temple-of-love-versailles-1775-left-and-the-ol/|title=Architectural Highlights of Carolina's Historic Campus|accessdate=2010-09-11|publisher =The Carolina Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; The well stands at the south end of McCorkle Place, the northern quad, between two of the campus's oldest buildings, [[Old East]], and Old West. Also located in McCorkle Place is the [[Davie Poplar]] tree under which the university's founder, [[William Richardson Davie]], supposedly selected the location for the university. The legend of the Davie Poplar says that if the tree falls, so will UNC.&lt;ref name=&quot;poplar&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Loewer|first=H. Peter|title=Jefferson's Garden|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Mechanicsburg, PA|year=2004|pages=228|isbn=0811700763}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the tree's questionable health from damage caused by severe weather such as [[Hurricane Fran]] in 1996, the university has planted two genetic clones nearby called Davie Poplar Jr. and Davie Poplar III.&lt;ref name=&quot;poplar&quot;/&gt; The second clone, Davie Poplar III, was planted in conjunction with the university's [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] celebration in 1993 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/tour/LEVEL_2/davie.htm|title=Davie Poplar|accessdate=2008-04-05|year=2001|work=A Self-Guided Tour of Campus|publisher=UNC Visitors' Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reflections&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2004/10/12/Features/Reflections.Of.A.Storied.Past-1360832.shtml|title=Reflections of a storied past|last=Valle|first=Kirsten|date=2004-10-12|location=Chapel Hill, NC|publisher=''The Daily Tar Heel''|accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another university landmark is the Confederate monument, known to students as [[Silent Sam]], erected to commemorate UNC students who died fighting for the [[Confederate States Army|Confederacy]]. The statue has at times been dogged by controversy, some critics claiming that the monument invokes memories of racism and slavery, while others counter that &quot;Silent Sam&quot; is simply historical and a part of the rich heritage of the [[Southern United States|South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/692/story/414858.html|title=Ceremony salutes flag and its cause|last=Nesbitt|first=Jim|date=2006-03-05|location=Raleigh, NC|publisher=''The News &amp; Observer''|accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070911022704/http://www.newsobserver.com/692/story/414858.html |archivedate = September 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statue depicts a soldier armed with a rifle, but lacking a cartridge box.  Thus, Silent Sam does not carry any ammunition and is a &quot;benign&quot; soldier.  The statue was erected in 1913 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to honor the school's Confederate heroes.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Weiss Urban Livability Program&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradschool.unc.edu/programs/weiss/interesting_place/landmarks/sam.html|title=Silent Sam|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student members of the university's [[Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies]] are not allowed to walk on the grass of McCorkle Place out of respect for the unknown resting place of [[Joseph Caldwell]], the university's first president.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu/di_phi/join.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;The MoreheadâPatterson bell tower was commissioned by [[John Motley Morehead III]], the benefactor of the prestigious [[Morehead Scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unc.edu/about/landmarks.html UNC.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The hedge and surrounding landscape was designed by [[William Chambers Coker|William C. Coker]], botany professor and creator of the [[Coker Arboretum|campus arboretum]]. Traditionally, seniors have the opportunity to climb the tower a few days prior to May commencement.&lt;ref name=&quot;unc.edu&quot;/&gt;

The historic [[Playmakers Theatre]] is located on Cameron Avenue between McCorkle Place and Polk Place. It was designed by [[Alexander Jackson Davis]], the same architect who renovated the northern faÃ§ade of [[Old East]] in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu/tour/LEVEL_2/playmakers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The east-facing building was completed in 1851 and initially served as a library and as a ballroom. It was originally named Smith Hall after North Carolina Governor [[Benjamin Smith (North Carolina)|General Benjamin Smith]], who was a special aide to [[George Washington]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was an early benefactor to the university.&lt;ref&gt;http://museum.unc.edu/exhibits/early_benefactors/benjamin-smith-1756-1826-1/&lt;/ref&gt; When the library moved to Hill Hall in 1907, the School of Law occupied Smith Hall until 1923. In 1925, the structure was renovated and used as a stage by the university theater group, the Carolina Playmakers.  It has remained a theater to the present day. [[Louis Round Wilson]] wrote in 1957 that Playmakers Theatre is the &quot;architectural gem of the campus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planroom.unc.edu/Bldg/Detail.asp?id=042&amp;view=aliases&lt;/ref&gt; Playmakers Theatre was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;www.nps.gov/nhl/designations/Lists/NC01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the building is a venue for student drama productions, concerts, and events sponsored by academic departments. In 2006, the university began a renovation of Playmakers Theatre, which has included an exterior paint job and interior remodeling.  The renovation is expected to be complete by the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2010/07/playmakers_theatre_to_reopen&lt;/ref&gt;

At the undergraduate level, all students must fulfill a number of general education requirements as part of the Making Connections curriculum, which was introduced in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advising.unc.edu|title=Academic Advising Program|publisher=UNC Academic Advising Program|accessdate= December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  English, social science, history, foreign language, mathematics, and natural science courses are required of all students, ensuring that they receive a broad [[liberal arts]] education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advising.unc.edu/guidelines|title=Academic Policies|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=2009-04-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822022809/http://advising.unc.edu/guidelines |archivedate = August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university also offers a wide range of first year seminars for incoming freshmen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu/fys/aboutfys.html&lt;/ref&gt; After their [[sophomore]] year, students move on to the College of Arts and Sciences, or choose an undergraduate professional school program within the schools of medicine, nursing, business, education, pharmacy, information and library science, public health, or journalism and mass communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admissions.unc.edu/faq/studying.htm#choose|title=When do I choose my major?|year=2005|work=Studying FAQs|publisher=UNC Office of Undergraduate Admissions|accessdate=2008-06-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080610021658/http://www.admissions.unc.edu/faq/studying.htm#choose |archivedate = June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates are held to an eight-semester limit of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://advising.unc.edu/FAQ/ParentsCouncilFAQs#is-a-student-required|title=Frequently Asked Questions|year=2010|work=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=UNC Academic Advising program|accessdate=2010-12-12 |archiveurl = http://advising.unc.edu/FAQ/ParentsCouncilFAQs#is-a-student-required|archivedate = December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honor Code===
The university has a longstanding [[Honor Code]] known as the &quot;Instrument of Student Judicial Governance,&quot; supplemented by an entirely student-run Honor System to resolve issues with students accused of academic and conduct offenses against the university community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://honor.unc.edu/|title=The Honor Code|publisher=Honor Court of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Honor System is divided into three branches: the Student Attorney General Staff, the Honor Court, and the Honor System Outreach.  The Student Attorney General is appointed by the Student Body President to investigate all reports of Honor Code violations and determine whether or not to bring charges against the student as detailed in the &quot;Instrument.&quot;  The Attorney General is supported by a select staff of around 40 students.  The Honor Court is led by the Chair, who is appointed by the Student Body President, and supported by Vice Chairs who adjudicate all students' hearings.  The Honor Court as a whole is made up of some 80 selected students.  The Honor System Outreach is a branch of the System solely devoted to promoting honor and integrity in the University community.  UNC is the only public university, with the exception of the military academies, that has a '''completely''' student-run system from the beginning to the end of the process.

For decades UNC has offered an undergraduate merit scholarship known as the Morehead-Cain Scholarship. Recipients receive tuition, room and board, books, and funds for summer study for four years. Since the inception of the Morehead scholarship program, 29 alumni of the program have been named [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moreheadcain.org/about/news/paul_laurence_rhodes_scholars/|title=Paul Shorkey '11 and Laurence Deschamps-Laporte '11 Named Rhodes Scholars|accessdate=2010-11-23|year=2010|publisher=MoreheadâCain Foundation

In 2003, Chancellor [[James Moeser]] announced the Carolina Covenant, which provides a debt free education to low-income students who are academically qualified to attend the university. The program was the second in the nation (following [[Princeton University|Princeton]]) and the first of its kind at a public university. Around 80 other universities have since followed suit.

===Rivalries===
{{main|Carolina-Duke rivalry|Carolina-NC State rivalry|South's Oldest Rivalry|l1=Duke Rivalry|l2=North Carolina State Rivalry|13=South's Oldest Rivalry}}
The [[South's Oldest Rivalry (UNC-Virginia)|South's Oldest Rivalry]] between North Carolina and its first opponent, the [[University of Virginia]], was prominent throughout much of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1122productions.com/rivalries/most-played.html|title=Most-Played Rivalries|accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; September 2008 saw the 117th meeting in [[college football|football]] between the two teams. Carolina has also been a rival with [[North Carolina State University]]. Comments made by the football coaches of each college led to a revival in the rivalry, particularly in football, in late 2011. Traditionally, the students from each school exchange pranks before football games, such as painting North Carolina State's [[Free Expression Tunnel]] blue in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.technicianonline.com/media/storage/paper848/news/2006/11/16/News/Ram-Roast.Deters.Tar.Heel.Blue.Tunnel-2463417.shtml|title=Ram Roast deters Tar Heel blue tunnel|last=Blakely|first=Kyle|date=2006-11-16|location=Raleigh, NC|publisher=''Technician''|accessdate=2008-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In retaliation, NC State students travel to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] to paint campus landmarks red and a play the NC State fight song and alma mater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://media.www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2008/02/21/University/Campus.Awakes.To.A.Red.Old.Well-3224421.shtml|title= Campus awakes to a red Old Well|last= Tovar|first= Sergio|date= 2008-02-21|location=Chapel Hill, NC|publisher=''The Daily Tar Heel''|accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== UNC-Duke Rivalry ====
The most important rivalry on campus is with Durham's [[Duke University]]. Located only eight miles from each other, the schools regularly compete in both athletics and academics. The [[Carolina-Duke rivalry]] is most intense, however, in  [[college basketball|basketball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hbo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/richard_deitsch/06/22/media.623/index.html|title=HBO probes Carolina-Duke rivalry|last=Deitsch|first=Richard|work=Media Circus|publisher=SI.com|accessdate=2008-06-24|date=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a combined nine national championships in men's basketball, both teams have been frequent contenders for the national championship for decades. The rivalry has been the focus of several books, including Will Blythe's ''To Hate Like This Is to Be Happy Forever'' and was the focus of the HBO documentary ''Battle for Tobacco Road: Duke vs Carolina''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HBO.com|url=http://www.hbo.com/sports/battle-for-tobacco-road-duke-vs-carolina/index.html|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After important basketball victories, most notably after Duke games and NCAA championships, students traditionally rush downtown to [[Franklin Street (Chapel Hill)|Franklin Street]], which the police close to traffic. People converge at and around Franklin and Columbia Streets near campus and light bonfires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/264/story/549933.html|title=Bonfires mark Tar Heels' win|last=Rocha|first=Jessica|date=2007-03-05|location=Raleigh, NC|publisher=''The News &amp; Observer''|accessdate=2008-05-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2009 National Championship, 45,000 people rushed Franklin Street to celebrate the victory.

===School colors===

Since the beginning of intercollegiate athletics at UNC in the late nineteenth century, the school's colors have been [[Carolina blue]] also known as &quot;baby blue&quot; and white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sumner|first=Jim L.|title=A History of Sports in North Carolina|publisher=Division of Archives and History, NC Department of Cultural Resources|location=Raleigh, NC|year=1990|pages=35|isbn=0865262411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors were chosen years before by the [[Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies|Dialectic (blue) and Philanthropic (white) Societies]], the oldest student organization at the university. The school had required participation in one of the clubs, and traditionally the &quot;Di&quot;s were from the western part of North Carolina while the &quot;Phi&quot;s were from the eastern part of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carolina Review, vol.
