The term '''''open source''''' describes practices in production and development that promote access to the end product's source materials. Some consider open source a philosophy, others consider it a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic methodology]]. Before the term ''open source'' became widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of phrases to describe the concept; ''open source'' gained hold with the rise of the [[Internet]], and the attendant need for massive retooling of the computing [[source code]]. Opening the source code enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models, communication paths, and interactive communities.&lt;ref&gt;The complexity of such communication relates to [[Brooks' law]], and it is also described by [[Eric S. Raymond]], &quot;Brooks predicts that as your number of programmers N rises, work performed scales as N but complexity and vulnerability to bugs rises as N-squared. N-squared tracks the number of communications paths (and potential code interfaces) between developers' code bases.&quot; â[http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-revenge.html &quot;The Revenge of the Hackers&quot;]. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the new phrase &quot;[[open-source software]]&quot; was born to describe the environment that the new [[copyright]], [[licensing]], [[Domain name|domain]], and consumer issues created.

The open-source model includes the concept of concurrent yet different agendas and differing approaches in production, in contrast with more centralized models of [[Software developer|development]] such as those typically used in commercial software companies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric S. Raymond|Raymond, Eric S.]] ''[[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]]''. ed 3.0. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A main principle and practice of open-source software development is [[peer production]] by bartering and collaboration, with the end-product, source-material, &quot;[[blueprints]],&quot; and documentation available at no cost to the public. This is increasingly being applied in other fields of endeavor, such as [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/sreelatha-menon-researchers-sans-borders/00/19/350429/ &quot;Science 2.0 is here as CSIR resorts to open-source drug research for TB&quot; Business Standard, 1 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of free and open source software}}
The concept of open source and the free sharing of technological information existed long before computers. For example, cooking recipes have been shared since the beginning of human culture. Open source can pertain to businesses and to computers, software and technology.

In the early years of automobile development, a group of capital [[monopoly|monopolists]] owned the rights to a [[2 cycle|2-cycle]] gasoline engine patent originally filed by [[George B. Selden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;carculture&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=James J. Flink |title=The Car Culture |publisher=MIT Press |year=1977 |isbn=0-262-56015-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By controlling this patent, they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands, or risk a lawsuit. In 1911, independent automaker [[Henry Ford]] won a challenge to the Selden patent. The result was that the Selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association (which would eventually become the [[Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association]]) was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;carculture&quot; /&gt; The new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US auto manufacturers: although each company would develop technology and file patents, these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money between all the manufacturers.&lt;ref name=&quot;carculture&quot; /&gt; By the time the US entered World War 2, 92 Ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared between these manufacturers, without any exchange of money (or lawsuits).&lt;ref name=&quot;carculture&quot; /&gt;

Very similar to [[open standards]], researchers with access to [[Advanced Research Projects Agency Network]] (ARPANET) used a process called [[Request for Comments]] to develop telecommunication network protocols. This collaborative process of the 1960s led to the birth of the [[Internet]] in 1969.

Early instances of open source and [[free software]] include [[IBM]]'s source releases of its [[operating system]]s and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s, and the [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fisher|first=Franklin M. |coauthors=James W. McKie, Richard B. Mancke |title= IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History|publisher= Praeger|year =1983 |isbn =0-03-063059-2 |pages=172â9}}  IBM unbundled (began charging for) software June 23, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/ibm7090.html Dave Pitts' IBM 7090 support] â An example of distributed source: Page contains a link to [[IBM 7090/94 IBSYS]] source, including [[COBOL]] and [[FORTRAN]] compilers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a foreshadowing of the Internet, software with source code included became available on [[BBS]] networks in the 1980s. This was sometimes a necessity; software written in [[BASIC]] and other [[interpreted language]]s could only be distributed as source code, and much of it was freeware. When people began gathering such source code, and setting up boards specifically to discuss its modification, this was a de-facto open source system. 

One of the most obvious examples of this is one of the most-used BBS systems and networks, [[WWIV]], developed initially in BASIC by [[Wayne Bell]]. A culture of &quot;modding&quot; his software and distributing the mods, grew up so extensively that when the software was ported to first [[Pascal]], then [[C++]], its source code continued to be distributed to registered users, who would share mods and compile their own versions of the software. This may have contributed to its being a dominant system and network, despite being outside the [[Fidonet]] umbrella that was shared by so many other BBS makers.

Open source on the Internet began when the Internet was relatively primitive, with software distributed via [[UUCP]], [[Usenet]], and [[irc]], and [[gopher (protocol)|gopher]]. Linux, for example, was first widely distributed by posts to comp.os.linux on the Usenet, which is also where its development was discussed. Linux became the archetype for organized open source development, in general.

As the Internet grew, open source-style software progressed to more advanced presentation and sharing forms through the [[World Wide Web]] (of which gopher was a precursor). There are now many Web sites, organizations and businesses that promote the open-source sharing of everything from computer code to mechanics of improving a product, technique, or medical advancement.

The label âopen sourceâ was adopted by some people in the [[free software]] movement at a strategy session&lt;ref name=osihistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI |date=September 19, 2006 |first=Michael |last=Tiemann |authorlink=Michael Tiemann |publisher=[[Open Source Initiative]] |accessdate=August 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; held at [[Palo Alto, California]], in reaction to [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]]'s January 1998 announcement of a source code release for [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]]. The group of individuals at the session included [[Christine Peterson]] who suggested âopen sourceâ, Todd Anderson, [[Larry Augustin]], [[Jon Hall (programmer)|Jon Hall]], Sam Ockman, [[Michael Tiemann]] and [[Eric S. Raymond]]. Over the next week, Raymond and others worked on spreading the word. [[Linus Torvalds]] gave an all-important sanction the following day. Phil Hughes offered a pulpit in ''[[Linux Journal]]''. [[Richard Stallman]], pioneer of the free software movement, flirted with adopting the term, but changed his mind.&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt; Those people who adopted the term used the opportunity before the release of Navigator's source code to free themselves of the ideological and confrontational connotations of the term &quot;free software&quot;. Netscape released its source code under the [[Netscape Public License]] and later under the [[Mozilla Public License]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Muffatto000&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Open Source: A Multidisciplinary Approach | first = Moreno | last = Muffatto | publisher = Imperial College Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 1860946658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was given a big boost at an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]]. Originally titled the âFreeware Summitâ and later known as the âOpen Source Summitâ,&lt;ref name=opensourcesummit&gt;[http://linuxgazette.net/issue28/rossum.html Open Source Summit] Linux Gazette. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The event brought together the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including Linus Torvalds, [[Larry Wall]], [[Brian Behlendorf]], [[Eric Allman]], [[Guido van Rossum]], [[Michael Tiemann]], [[Paul Vixie]], [[Jamie Zawinski]] of Netscape, and Eric Raymond. At that meeting, the confusion caused by the name free software was brought up. Tiemann argued for âsourcewareâ as a new term, while Raymond argued for âopen source.â The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference that evening. Five days later, Raymond made the first public call to the free software community to adopt the new term.&lt;ref name=&quot;raymondCall&quot;&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html Goodbye, &quot;free software&quot;; hello, &quot;open source&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Open Source Initiative]] was formed shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=osihistory/&gt;

Starting in the early 2000s, a number of companies began to publish a portion of their source code to claim they were open source, while keeping key parts closed. This led to the development of the now widely used terms ''[[free open source software|free open-source software]]'' and ''[[commercial open source software|commercial open-source software]]'' to distinguish between truly open and hybrid forms of open source.{{Or|date=January 2010}}

==Economic analysis==

Most economists agree that open-source candidates have an [[information good]]&lt;ref&gt;Grandstand, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; (also termed 'knowledge good') aspect. In general, this suggests that the original work involves a great deal of time, money, and effort. However, the cost of reproducing the work is very low, so that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost â this is referred to as the marginal cost of a product. At this point, it is necessary to consider a [[copyright]]. The idea of copyright for works of authorship is to protect the incentive of making these original works. Copyright restriction then creates access costs on consumers who value the original more than making an additional copy but value the original less than the initial production cost. Thus, they will pay an access cost of this difference. Access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create something based on another work but are not willing to pay the copyright holder for the rights to the copyrighted work. The second type of cost incurred with a copyright system is the cost of administration and enforcement of the copyright.

Being organized effectively as a [[consumers' cooperative]], the idea of open source is then to eliminate the access costs of the consumer and the creator by reducing the restrictions of copyright. This will lead to creation of additional works, which build upon previous work and add to greater social benefit. Additionally some proponents argue that open source also relieves society of the administration and enforcement costs of copyright. Organizations such as [[Creative Commons]] have websites where individuals can file for alternative âlicensesâ, or levels of restriction, for their works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/ About the Creative Commons Licenses]&lt;/ref&gt; These self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement. Thus, on several fronts, there is an efficiency argument to be made on behalf of open-sourced goods.

Others argue that society loses through open-sourced goods. Because there is a loss in monetary incentive to the creation of new goods some argue that new products will not be created. This argument seems to apply particularly well to the business model where extensive research and development is done, e.g. pharmaceuticals. However, this argument ignores the fact that cost reduction for all concerned is perhaps an even better monetary incentive than is a price increase. In addition, others argue that visual art and other works of authorship should be free. These proponents of extensive open-source ideals argue that monetary incentive for artists would perhaps better be derived from performances or exhibitions, in a similar fashion to the funding of provision of other types of services.

===Case study===
An investigation of open-source [[industrial symbiosis]] was performed by Doyle and Pearce using [[Google Earth]]. Their paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mse.mtu.edu/~pearce/papers/2009%20OES%20Doyle%20Open%20source%20IS.pdf &quot;Utilization of Virtual Globes for Open Source Industrial Symbiosis&quot;] from Pearce Research Group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; found that virtual globes coupled with open-source waste information can be used to:

# Reduce [[embodied energy]] of transport by reducing distances to recycling facilities
# Choose end-of-life at recycling facilities rather than landfills
# Establish industrial symbiosis and Eco-industrial parks on known by-product synergies

Ultimately, the open-source sharing of information in [[virtual globes]] provide a means to identify economically and environmentally beneficial opportunities for waste management if the data have been made available.

==Applications==

Many fields of study and social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source. Advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields. For example, [[Linus Torvalds]] said, &quot;the future is open source everything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencelive.org/component/option,com_mediadb/task,view/idstr,S-517352/Itemid,26&lt;/ref&gt;  But [[Eric Raymond]] and other founders of the open-source movement have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software, saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story is less compelling. The broader impacts of the open-source movement, and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures, remain to be seen.

The open-source movement has inspired increased [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and liberty in other fields, including the release of [[biotechnology]] research by [[CAMBIA]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/470.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wikipedia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/40486&lt;/ref&gt; and other projects. The open-source concept has also been applied to media other than computer programs, e.g., by [[Creative Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;http://creativecommons.org/software&lt;/ref&gt; It also constitutes an example of user innovation (see for example the book ''[[Democratizing Innovation]]'').&lt;ref&gt;http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10446&lt;/ref&gt; Often, open source is an expression where it simply means that a system is available to all who wish to work on it. The difference between [[crowdsourcing]] and open source is that open-source production is a cooperative activity initiated and voluntarily undertaken by members of the public

* There are few examples of business information (methodologies, advice, guidance, practices) using the open-source model, although this is another case where the potential is enormous. [[ITIL]] is close to open source. It uses the Cathedral model (no mechanism exists for user contribution) and the content must be bought for a fee that is small by business consulting standards (hundreds of British pounds).

Open-source culture is the creative practice of appropriation and free sharing of found and created content. Examples include [[collage]], [[found footage]] film, music, and [[appropriation art]]. Open-source culture is one in which [[fixation]]s, works entitled to copyright protection, are made generally available. Participants in the culture can modify those products and redistribute them back into the community or other organizations.

The rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve appropriation, and therefore require access to content that is often [[copyright]]ed, and increasingly restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content. The two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright (particularly in the [[United States]]) and penalties, such as those articulated in the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although artistic appropriation is often permitted under [[fair use|fair-use]] doctrines, the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners. Also, the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a &quot;[[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]]&quot; among cultural practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chillingeffects.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, cultural practitioners began to adopt the intellectual property licensing techniques of free software and open-source software to make their work more freely available to others, including the [[Creative Commons]].

The idea of an &quot;open-source&quot; culture runs parallel to &quot;[[Free Culture movement|Free Culture]],&quot; but is substantively different. ''Free culture'' is a term derived from the [[free software movement]], and in contrast to that vision of culture, proponents of open-source culture (OSC) maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers. Yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought. Instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes, an argument for OSC takes into account diverse goods (as in &quot;the Good life&quot;) and ends.

One way of achieving the goal of making the fixations of cultural work generally available is to maximally utilize technology and [[digital media]]. In keeping with [[Moore's law]]'s prediction about processors, the cost of digital media and storage plummeted in the late 20th Century. Consequently, the [[marginal cost]] of digitally duplicating anything capable of being transmitted via digital media dropped to near zero. Combined with an explosive growth in [[personal computer]] and technology ownership, the result is an increase in general population's access to digital media. This phenomenon facilitated growth in open-source culture because it allowed for rapid and inexpensive duplication and distribution of culture. Where the access to the majority of culture produced prior to the advent of digital media was limited by other constraints of proprietary and potentially &quot;open&quot; mediums, digital media is the latest technology with the potential to increase access to cultural products. Artists and users who choose to distribute their work digitally face none of the physical limitations that traditional cultural producers have been typically faced with. Accordingly, the audience of an open-source culture faces little physical cost in acquiring digital media.

Open-source culture precedes [[Richard Stallman]]'s codification of free software with the creation of the [[Free Software Foundation]]. As the public began to communicate through [[Bulletin Board Systems]] (BBS) like [[FidoNet]], places like Sourcery Systems BBS were dedicated to providing source code to [[Public Domain]], [[Shareware]] and [[Freeware]] programs.

Essentially born out of a desire for increased general access to digital media, [[Internet|the Internet]] is open-source culture's most valuable asset. It is questionable whether the goals of an open-source culture could be achieved without the Internet. The global network not only fosters an environment where culture can be generally accessible, but also allows for easy and inexpensive redistribution of culture back into various communities. Some reasons for this are as follows.

First, the Internet allows even greater access to inexpensive digital media and storage. Instead of users being limited to their own facilities and resources, they are granted access to a vast network of facilities and resources, some free. Sites such as [[Archive.org]] offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a [[Creative Commons]] license. The resulting cultural product is then available to download free (generally accessible) to anyone with an Internet connection.

Second, users are granted unprecedented access to each other. Older analog technologies such as the [[telephone]] or [[television]] have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have. In the case of television there is little, if any interaction between users participating on the network. And in the case of the telephone, users rarely interact with any more than a couple of their known peers. On the Internet, however, users have the potential to access and meet millions of their peers. This aspect of the Internet facilitates the modification of culture as users are able to collaborate and communicate with each other across international and cultural boundaries. The speed in which digital media travels on the Internet in turn facilitates the redistribution of culture.

Through various technologies such as [[peer-to-peer]] networks and [[blogs]], cultural producers can take advantage of vast [[social networks]] to distribute their products. As opposed to traditional media distribution, redistributing digital media on the Internet can be virtually costless. Technologies such as [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] and [[Gnutella]] take advantage of various characteristics of the Internet protocol ([[TCP/IP]]) in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution.

===Government===
* [[Open politics]] (sometimes known as ''Open-source politics'') is a term used to describe a political process that uses Internet technologies such as blogs, email and polling to provide for a rapid feedback mechanism between political organizations and their supporters. There is also an alternative conception of the term ''Open-source politics'' which relates to the development of public policy under a set of rules and processes similar to the open-source software movement.
* [[Open source governance|open-source governance]] is similar to open-source politics, but it applies more to the democratic process and promotes the freedom of information.

===Ethics===
Open-source ethics is split into two strands:
* Open-source ethics as an ethical school â Charles Ess and David Berry are researching whether ethics can learn anything from an open-source approach. Ess famously even defined the AoIR Research Guidelines as an example of open-source ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensource.mit.edu/papers/berry2.pdf Berry (2004) Internet Ethics: Privacy, Ethics and Alienation â An Open Source Approach.] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Open-source ethics as a professional body of rules â This is based principally on the computer ethics school, studying the questions of ethics and professionalism in the computer industry in general and software development in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=El-Emam, K |title=Ethics and Open Source |journal=Empirical Software Engineering  |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=2001 |url=http://springerlink.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=hf0bld3qlk0unn8f8x2m&amp;referrer=parent&amp;backto=issue,2,12;journal,14,33;linkingpublicationresults,1:100262,1#ContactOfAuthor1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
[[Open source journalism|Open-source journalism]], referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking, and reflected a similar term that was in use from 1992 in military intelligence circles, [[open-source intelligence]]. It is now commonly used to describe forms of innovative publishing of [[online journalism]], rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist. In the December 25, 2006 issue of TIME magazine this is referred to as [[user generated content|user created content]] and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as [[OpenSolaris]] and [[Linux]].

[[Blog|Weblogs]], or blogs, are another significant platform for open-source culture. Blogs consist of periodic, reverse chronologically ordered posts, using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design, code, or [[file transfer]] required. While corporations, political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information, many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression, political organizing, and socializing. Some, such as [[LiveJournal]] or [[WordPress]], utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes. Whether the code is open or not, this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture; whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate, the mutability of blogs makes &quot;open sourcing&quot; even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere.

[[Messageboards]] are another platform for open-source culture. Messageboards (also known as discussion boards or forums), are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to. Messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are [[spamming|spammers]]. Other common board features are private messages (where users can send messages to one another) as well as chat (a way to have a real time conversation online) and image uploading. Some messageboards use [[phpBB]], which is a free open-source package. Where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors, messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly. Messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life â for instance, instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising, one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product, movie or CD. By removing the cultural middlemen, messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas.

[[OpenDocument]] is an [[open format|open]] [[document file format]] for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), [[spreadsheet]]s, charts, and presentations. Organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as OpenDocument avoid being [[Vendor lock-in|locked into]] a single software vendor, leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business, raises their prices, changes their software, or changes their [[software license|licensing]] terms to something less favorable.

[[Open source movie production|Open-source movie production]] is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production, a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production. The 2006 movie [[Elephants Dream]] is said to be the &quot;world's first open movie&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elephantsdream.org/ Elephantsdream.org]&lt;/ref&gt; created entirely using [[open source technology|open-source technology]].

An open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material, [[footage]], and other filmic elements, both in unedited and edited form. By doing so, on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film, helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary, as well as its thematic development. The first open-source documentary film is the non-profit &quot;[[The American Revolution]],&quot; which went into production in 2005, and will examine the role media played in the cultural, social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station WBCN-FM in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Web Power to the People,&quot; The Boston Herald, September 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Glory Days of the Rock of Boston,&quot; Boston Globe, Op-Ed, July 18, 2009.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;'BCN Documentary Looks for Archival Contributors,&quot; Boston Herald, August 11, 2009 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;WBCN and The American Revolution,&quot; The Huffington Post, August 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The film is being produced by Lichtenstein Creative Media and the non-profit Filmmakers Collaborative.  [http://www.opensourcecinema.org Open Source Cinema] is a website to create Basement Tapes, a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age, co-produced by the [http://www.nfb.ca National Film Board of Canada].
[[Open source film|Open-source film-making]] refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software, but in this case the 'source' for a film-maker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code. It can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is 'open' i.e. a disparate group of contributors, at different times contribute to the final piece.

[[Open-IPTV]] is [[IPTV]] that is not limited to one recording studio, production studio, or cast. Open-IPTV uses the Internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show.

===Education===
Within the academic community, there is discussion about expanding what could be called the &quot;intellectual commons&quot; (analogous to the [[Creative Commons]]). Proponents of this view have hailed the [[Connexions]] Project at [[Rice University]], [[MIT OpenCourseWare|OpenCourseWare]] project at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Eugene Thacker]]'s article on &quot;[[Open source DNA|open-source DNA]]&quot;, the &quot;Open Source Cultural Database&quot;, [[Salman_Khan_(educator)|Salman Khan]]'s Khan Academy and [[Wikipedia]] as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software.

[[Open source curriculum|Open-source curricula]] are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used, distributed and modified.

Another strand to the academic community is in the area of research. Many funded research projects produce software as part of their work. There is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license. In the UK the [[Jisc|Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)]] has developed a policy on open source software. JISC also funds a development service called [[OSS Watch]] which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use, contribute to and develop open source software.

===Innovation communities===
The principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement; for example, the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century. Open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community. The sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] described the four basic elements of the community â universalism (an international perspective), communalism (sharing information), disinterestedness (removing one's personal views from the scientific inquiry) and organized skepticism (requirements of proof and review) that accurately describe the scientific community today. These principles are, in part, complemented by US law's focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves. There is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary. One of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] â the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public. There are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online, however most journals do charge a fee (either to users or libraries for access). The Budapest Open Access Initiative is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the Internet. The [[National Institutes of Health]] has recently proposed a policy on &quot;Enhanced Public Access to NIH Research Information.&quot; This policy would provide a free, searchable resource of NIH-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication. The NIH's move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research. Many of the questions have yet to be answered â the balancing of profit vs. public access, and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access.

Farmavita.Net is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;Open Source Pharmaceuticals http://www.farmavita.net/content/view/336/84/&lt;/ref&gt; The project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines. It is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs. It will be limited to generic (off-patent) medicines with established use. By the definition, medicinal product have a âwell-established useâ if is used for at least 15 years, with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In that event, the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature.

[[Benjamin Franklin]] was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the [[Franklin stove]], [[bifocals]], and the [[lightning rod]] to the public domain.

New NGO communities are starting to use the open-source technology as a tool. One example is the Open Source Youth Network started in 2007 in Lisboa by ISCA members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isca-web.org/english/youth/yource/thenetwork ISCA â International Sport and Culture Association â Youth â Youth corner â Racism in football&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Open innovation]] is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting R&amp;D in a common pool. The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] platform is openly presenting itself as an Open innovation network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/membersminutes/20070920MembersMeeting/07.09.12-Eclipse-Open-Innovation.pdf Eclipse.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and recreation===
Copyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities. Some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yogaunity.org Open Source Yoga Unity â Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
