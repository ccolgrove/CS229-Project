The '''Secretary of State for the Colonies''' or '''Colonial Secretary''' was the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]] [[government minister|minister]] in charge of managing the [[United Kingdom]]'s various [[British Empire|colonial dependencies]].

The position was first created in 1768 to deal with the increasingly troublesome [[Thirteen colonies|North American]] colonies. Previously those responsibilities had fallen to the [[Secretary of State for the Southern Department]], who was responsible for Southern England, [[Wales]], [[Ireland]], the American colonies, and relations with the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] states of [[Europe]].

In 1782, following the loss of the American colonies, the office was abolished, and its duties given to the [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]], then [[Thomas Townshend, 1st Viscount Sydney|Lord Sydney]]. In 1794 a new office was created for [[Henry Dundas]] â the [[Secretary of State for War]], which now took responsibility for the Colonies, and was renamed the [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] in 1801. In 1854, military reforms led to the Colonial and Military responsibilities of this secretary of state being split into two separate offices, with [[Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Grey]] becoming the first Secretary of State for the Colonies under the new arrangement.

In the latter part of the nineteenth century the United Kingdom also gained control over a number of territories with the status of &quot;[[protectorate]]&quot;.  The ministerial responsibility for these territories was initially held by the [[Foreign Secretary]].  However, by the early years of the twentieth century the responsibility for each of these territories had been transferred to the Colonial Secretary as well.  The [[League of Nations mandate|League of Nations mandated territories]] acquired as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles (1919)]] became a further responsibility of the Colonial Office in the aftermath of the [[First World War]].

In 1925 part of the [[Colonial Office]] was separated out as the [[Dominions Office]], with its own [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs|Secretary of State]]. The new office was responsible for dealing with the [[Dominion]]s together with a small number of other territories (most notably [[Southern Rhodesia]]).

In the twenty years following the end of the [[Second World War]], much of the British Empire was dismantled as its various territories gained independence.  In consequence, the Colonial Office was merged in 1966 with the [[Commonwealth Relations Office]] (which until 1947 had been the Dominions Office) to form the [[Commonwealth Office]], while  ministerial responsibility was transferred to the [[Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs]] (previously known as the [[Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations]]).  In 1968 the Commonwealth Office was subsumed into the Foreign Office, which was renamed the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] (FCO).

The Colonial Secretary never had responsibility for the [[British India|provinces]] and [[princely state]]s of [[British Raj|India]], which had [[Secretary of State for India|its own Secretary of State]].

From 1768 until 1966 the Secretary of State was supported by an [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]] (at times an [[Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]]), and latterly by a [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies|Minister of State]].
