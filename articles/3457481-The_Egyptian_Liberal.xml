'''Imam Mohammad Ahmad Eissa''' or [[Sheikh]] Imam ({{lang-ar|Ø¥ÙØ§Ù ÙØ­ÙØ¯ Ø£Ø­ÙØ¯ Ø¹ÙØ³Ù}}) (July 2, 1918 &amp;ndash; June 7, 1995) was a famous [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[composer]] and [[singer]]. For most of his life, he formed a duo with the famous Egyptian [[colloquial]] poet [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]]. Together, they were known for their political songs in favor of the poor and the [[working classes]].

==Life and career==
Imam was born to a poor family in the [[Egypt]]ian village of Abul Numrus in [[Giza]]. He lost his sight when he was a child. At the age of five he joined a recitation class, where he memorized the [[Qurâan]]. He later moved to [[Cairo]] to study where he led a [[dervish]] life. In Cairo, Imam met Sheikh Darwish el-Hareery, a prominent musical figure at that time, who taught him the basics of music and [[muwashshah]] singing. He then worked with the Egyptian composer [[Zakariyya Ahmad]]. At that time, he expressed interest in Egyptian [[folk song]]s especially those by [[Sayed Darwish]] and Abdou el-Hamouly. He also performed at weddings and birthdays.

In 1962 he met the [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] poet [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]]. For many years, they formed a duo composing and singing political songs, mostly in favor of the poor oppressed classes and indicting the ruling classes. Though their songs were banned on [[Egyptian television|Egyptian Radio and Television stations]], they were popular among ordinary people in the 1960s and 1970s. Their revolutionary songs criticizing the government after the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] led them to imprisonment and detention several times. In the mid 80s Imam performed several concerts in [[France]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]]. Later Imam and Negm broke up after several disagreements. Imam died at the age of 78 after a long illness.
