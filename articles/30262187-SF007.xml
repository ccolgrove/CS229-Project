== Rationale ==

CLAs can be used to enable vendors to easily pursue legal resolution in the case of copyright disputes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apache.org/licenses/ licensing page&lt;/ref&gt; or to relicense products from which contributions have been received from third parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/ContributingFAQ Contributing FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;

== Users ==

Companies/projects that use CLAs include:

* [[Apache Software Foundation]]
* [[Canonical Ltd]], the company behind [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.canonical.com/contributors&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Zend]] for [[Zend Framework]] (1.x series only)
* [[Django (web framework)|Django]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/cla/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Node.js]] &lt;ref&gt;http://nodejs.org/cla.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Diaspora (software)|Diaspora]]&lt;ref&gt;http://github.com/diaspora/diaspora&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Joomla]]&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.joomla.org/contributor-agreements.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canonical ===

The '''Canonical contributor agreement''' was a [[Contributor License Agreement]] required by [[Canonical Ltd]] for all contributions to many projects established by Canonical.

In it, the contributor assigned copyright to Canonical and at the same time Canonical gave the contributor &quot;a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual right to use, copy, modify, communicate and make available to the public (including without limitation via the Internet) and distribute, in each case in an original or modified form, the Assigned Contributions as (they) wish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;main&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canonical.com/contributors | accessdate = 2010-12-31 | title = Canonical's contributor agreement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agreement&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.canonical.com/system/files/Canonical%20Contributor%20Agreement%2C%20ver%202.5.pdf|title = Contributor Agreement V2.5 |accessdate = 31 December 2010|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canonical started Project Harmony &quot;...to assist organisations which use contribution agreements by providing standardised variable templates with clear and concise explanations...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://opensource.com/law/10/6/project-harmony-looks-improve-contribution-agreements-0 | title = Project Harmony looks to improve contribution agreements | date = 2010-06-24 | author = Amanda Brock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2011, Canonical is requesting contributions be licenced under a Harmony Contribution Licence Agreement, rather than the copyright being assigned to Canonical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.canonical.com/contributors | title = Canonical's contributor agreement | date = 2011-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Projects requiring contributors to sign this agreement include:&lt;ref name=&quot;main&quot; /&gt;
* [[Unity (desktop environment)|Unity]]
* [[XSplash]]
* [[Launchpad (website)|Launchpad]]
* [[Uncomplicated Firewall|Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)]]
* [[Update Manager]]
* [[Ubiquity (software)|Ubiquity]]
* [[Ubuntu One]]
* [[Upstart]]

=== KDE ===
[[KDE]] uses [[Free Software Foundation Europe]]'s Fiduciary Licence Agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ev.kde.org/announcements/2008-08-22-fsfe-welcomes-fla.php | date = 2008-08-22 | title = FSFE welcomes KDE's adoption of the Fiduciary Licence Agreement (FLA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states in section 3.3:
{{quotation|
FSFE shall only exercise the granted rights and licences in accordance with the principles of Free Software as defined by the Free Software Foundations. FSFE guarantees to use the rights and licences transferred in strict accordance with the regulations imposed by Free Software licences, including, but not limited to, the GNU General Public Licence (GPL) or the GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL) respectively. In the event FSFE violates the principles of Free Software, all granted rights and licences shall automatically return to the Beneficiary and the licences granted hereunder shall be terminated and expire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fsfe.org/projects/ftf/FLA.en.pdf | accessdate = 2010-12-31 | title = Fiduciary Licence Agreement (Version 1.2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
However, it is optional and every contributor is allowed not to assign his copyright to KDE e.V.
