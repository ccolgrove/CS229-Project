In 2001, Clarke auditioned for the role of [[Counter Terrorist Unit|CTU]] agent [[Nina Myers]] on ''24''. She won the role on the day that filming began. The wardrobe department didn't have time to fit her, so she had to wear her own outfit for the entire season of filming. In her three seasons with the show, Clarke was featured in a total of 36 episodes. Clarke won a [[Golden Satellite Award]] for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Drama Series for this role.&lt;ref name=&quot;tv.com&quot;/&gt; Clarke also lent her voice to ''[[24: The Game]]'', as her ''24'' character, Nina Myers.

She played RenÃ©e Dwyer, Bella Swan's mother, in [[Twilight (2008 film)|''Twilight'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywood.com&quot;/&gt; She accepted a leading role on new TNT series entitled ''[[Trust Me (TV series)|Trust Me]]'', opposite [[Eric McCormack]] and [[Thomas Cavanagh]]. The series premiered on January 26, 2009 to positive reviews, though it was cancelled after one season due to declining ratings. In 2010, Clarke reprised her role as RenÃ©e Dwyer in ''[[Eclipse (2010 film)|Eclipse]]'', the third movie in the ''Twilight series''.

==Personal life==
Clarke met her husband, [[Xander Berkeley]], while on the set of ''24'' (he played her supervisor, [[George Mason (24 character)|George Mason]]) and they were married in September 2002, a year after meeting. They have two daughters: Olwyn Harper (born on September 23, 2006) and Rowan (born c. March 2010).
