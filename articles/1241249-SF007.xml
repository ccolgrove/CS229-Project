'''Dogmatix''' is a [[fictional character]], a tiny white dog who belongs to [[Obelix]] in the [[Asterix]] comics. Dogmatix is a pun on the words [[dog]] and [[dogma]]tic. In the original French his name is '''IdÃ©fix''', itself a pun on the French expression ''[[IdÃ©e fixe (psychology)|idÃ©e fixe]]'' (fixed idea) meaning an obsession. This pun is unusual for a translation in that it is remarkably close to the original meaning and adds to it (by inclusion of the ''dog-'' syllable).

Dogmatix is the only main character  in the [[List of Asterix volumes|series]] that is an animal. His role is minor in most of the stories, significant mainly as a 'bone' of contention between [[Asterix (character)|Asterix]] and Obelix as to whether he should be allowed to accompany them on their adventures. However, he is often doing something interesting in the background and occasionally fulfils an important part of the plot.

In the words of the authors, Dogmatix is the only known &quot;canine ecologist&quot; who loves trees and howls in distress whenever one is damaged. Despite his small size, he is quite fearless. He has drunk the magic potion on a number of occasions, but his favourite treat is to 'chew a bone'.

Dogmatix makes his first appearance in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]''. He is first seen sitting in front of a butcher's shop in [[Lutetia]], watching Asterix and Obelix go in. He then follows Asterix and Obelix all around Gaul, appearing in nearly every panel of the story until the end. The fact that he ran after them throughout the story was meant to be a literal [[running gag]]. He went unnoticed by the two men until the very end when he attracted Obelix' attention at the closing banquet and was given a pat on the head and a bone. He was meant to be a one-off character (hence his leaving the village in the final picture) but he was so effective that it was decided to bring him back.

Thus his next appearance is in the next adventure, ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' in which he played a more active role and was given a name. He caused Asterix and Obelix to argue about whether or not he should accompany them to Egypt, but proved his worth when he followed the [[Gauls]] into a [[pyramid]] in which they were lost and guided them out safely (with the promise of lots of bones).

Like many dogs, Dogmatix is very protective and jealous of his master, especially when he falls for, or is shown affection by, beautiful young women. In ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'' he makes very clear his loathing for Panacea with whom Obelix had fallen in love. He shows the same attitude to Influenza in ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'' and Melodrama in ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide]]''. However, despite his loyalty to his master, Dogmatix has been shown to side with Asterix in arguments on various occasions, such as in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'' and ''[[Obelix and Co.]]''

His friendship with [[Recurring characters in Asterix#Others|Pepe]] in ''[[Asterix in Spain]] '' and ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'' causes Obelix to become very jealous. Likewise, Dogmatix is unimpressed by Obelix's attraction towards Panacea in the earlier stages of '''[[Asterix the Legionary]]''' and is hostile and growls when his master asks her to look after him while he is away. However, Panacea kisses him straightaway, putting him into a lovestruck daze.

In ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'', he finds a mate and returns with a litter of puppies.

==Dogmatix books==
Dogmatix's great popularity gave rise to a line of children's books in 1973 featuring his &quot;adventures&quot;.  These were in the form of text with illustrations and were not consistent with the Asterix stories.

# IdÃ©fix fait du sport. (Dogmatix the Athlete)
# IdÃ©fix et la petite fille. (Dogmatix and the Little Girl)
# IdÃ©fix au cirque. (Dogmatix at the Circus)
# Une folle poursuite. (The Crazy Chase)
# IdÃ©fix se fait un ami. (Dogmatix Makes a Friend)
# La chasse au sanglier. (Dogmatix and the Boar Hunt)
# L'orage. (Dogmatix and the Storm)
# Un gouter bien meritÃ©. (The Well-Deserved Tea Party)
# Idefix et le bÃ©bÃ©. (Dogmatix and the Baby)
# IdÃ©fix et le poisson clown. (Dogmatix and the Lost Fish)
# L'anniversaire d'IdÃ©fix. (Dogmatix' Birthday)
# IdÃ©fix Ã  la neige. (Dogmatix in the Snow)
# IdÃ©fix magicien. (Dogmatix the Wizard)
# IdÃ©fix et le perroquet. (Dogmatix and the Parrot)

Although, they carry the Goscinny/Uderzo byline, these are licenced works aimed at the children's market. They lack the style and sophistication of the main Asterix creative team, and have little or no editing for continuity. Although widely translated ('''not''' by the regular English translators of the Asterix comics), these comics did not become very popular, and are mostly forgotten.

In 1983, an attempt was made to revive the series with two new stories. These were translated by [[Derek Hockridge]] and [[Anthea Bell]], who were the regular English language translators of the Asterix albums.

# Idefix et le vilain petit aiglon. (Dogmatix and the Ugly Little Eagle)
# Idefix et la grande fringale. (Dogmatix and the Magic Potions)
