'''Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Ministerstwo Rolnictwa i Rozwoju Wsi}}) was formed on October 1999, from transformation of ''Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy of Poland''; the ministry can trace its history to 1944.

The Ministry's 1999 incarnation was because development of rural regions was Poland's greatest political, economic, and social challenge that was uncontested by both coalition and opposition politicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ce-review.org/99/11/best11_hermann.html Hermann, Rudolf &quot;Ready for the Chop&quot; Central Europe Review, Vol 1, No 11, 6 September 1999], retrieved on 17 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry is concerned with various aspects of Polish [[agriculture]] and improving its [[rural]] areas.

Current minister is [[Marek Sawicki]].
