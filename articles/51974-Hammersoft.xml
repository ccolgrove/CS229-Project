'''Mountain Dew''' (currently stylized as '''MTN Dew''') is a citrus-flavored carbonated [[soft drink]] brand produced and owned by [[PepsiCo]]. The original formula was invented in the 1940s by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman and was first marketed in [[Marion, VA]], Knoxville and [[Johnson City, Tennessee]]. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth in 1958. The Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired by the Pepsi-Cola company in 1964, at which point its distribution expanded more widely across the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=pep1964&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Coca-Cola, in Direct Attack on Pepsi, to Introduce Challenger to Mountain Dew|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/16/business/coca-cola-in-direct-attack-on-pepsi-to-introduce-challenger-to-mountain-dew.html|accessdate=12 January 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=16 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1940s and 1980s, Mountain Dew consisted of a single [[citrus]]-flavored version. Diet Mountain Dew was introduced in 1988,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2006&quot; /&gt; followed by Mountain Dew Red which was introduced - and discontinued - in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;dewhistbook&quot; /&gt; While Mountain Dew Red was short-lived, it represented the beginning of a long-term trend of Mountain Dew being produced in different flavor variations. This product line extension trend has continued in the 2000s, with expansion into specialty, limited time production, and retailer-specific ([[Taco Bell]], [[7-Eleven]]) variations of Mountain Dew.

Production was first extended to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1996, though this initial debut was short-lived as it was phased out in 1998. The product returned to the UK under the name &quot;Mountain Dew Energy&quot; in 2010 and returned to the [[Republic of Ireland]] in Spring 2011.&lt;ref name=ukdewlaunch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kimberley|first=Sara|title=Mountain Dew returns (to UK) with social media push|journal=Brand Republic (U.K.)|date=18 May 2010|url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/1003874/Mountain-Dew-returns-social-media-push|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, Mountain Dew represented a 6.7 percent share of the overall carbonated soft drinks market in the U.S.&lt;ref name=bevdigest2009top&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sicher|first=John|title=Top-10 Carbonated Soft Drink Brands for 2009|journal=Beverage Digest|date=24 March 2010|url=http://www.beverage-digest.com/pdf/top-10_2010.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its competition includes [[Vault (soft drink)|Vault]], [[Mello Yello]], and [[Sun Drop]]; Mountain Dew accounts for eighty percent of [[citrus]] soft drinks sold within the U.S.&lt;ref name=80mktcitrus&gt;{{cite news|title=Branded Entertainment Could Boost PepsiCo|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/211464-branded-entertainment-could-boost-pepsico|accessdate=21 January 2011|newspaper=Seeking Alpha|date=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Packaging==
The name âMountain Dewâ was first trademarked by Ally and Barney Hartman in the 1940s, who coined the name from a [[colloquial]] term for [[moonshine]] whiskey. Early bottles and signage carried the reference forward by showing a [[cartoon]]-stylized mountaineer. The first sketches of the original Mountain Dew bottle labels were devised in 1948 by John Brichetto, and the representation on product packaging has changed at multiple points in the history of the beverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;dewhistbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridgforth|first=Dick|title=Mountain Dew: The History|url=http://books.google.com/?id=78HnGAAACAAJ&amp;dq=mountain+dew+book|accessdate=30 January 2011|edition=4|year=2007|publisher=BookSurge Publishing|isbn=1-4196-6087-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logo===
[[File:Mountain Dew sign Tonto Arizona.jpg|thumb|right|1950's Mountain Dew advertisement sign in Tonto, Arizona]]
[[PepsiCo]] (known then as The Pepsi-Cola Company) acquired the Mountain Dew brand in 1964, and shortly thereafter in 1973 the [[logo]] was modified as the company sought to shift its focus to a âyounger, outdoorsyâ generation. This direction continued as the logo remained the same through the 1970s, 80s and into the late 1990s. Later updates to the logo were made in 1999 and again in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;dewhistbook&quot; /&gt; On October 15, 2008, the Mountain Dew logo was redesigned to ''&quot;Mtn Dew&quot;'' within the U.S. market, as a result of a PepsiCo rebranding of its core carbonated soft-drink products.&lt;ref name=&quot;logo2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.ca.msn.com/investing/gallery.aspx?cp-documentid=27219769&amp;page=2|title=The Best and Worst Logo Redesigns|date=16 January 2011|work=MSN Money|page=2|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the variant flavors continued to use the previous design until May 2011, when it was revealed that the &quot;Code Red&quot;, &quot;LiveWire&quot;, &quot;Voltage&quot;, and &quot;Baja Blast&quot; flavor variants would be given redesigned packaging, including new logos to correspond with the &quot;Mtn Dew&quot; style. The returning flavors &quot;Pitch Black&quot; &quot;Supernova&quot; &quot;Typhoon&quot; and &quot;Game Fuel&quot; were given redesigned packaging and logos for their re-release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevnet.com/news/2008/10-13-2008-pepsi_redesign.asp |title=Pepsi to redesign core products icon |publisher=BevNET.com |date=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/855193/Pepsi-rolls-700m-global-brand-makeover|title=News: PepsiCo's &quot;Sidekick&quot; Bottle for Mountain Dew|publisher=BevReview|accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sidekick Bottles===
Beginning in summer 2010, a secondary type of Mountain Dew bottles began appearing on select U.S. shelves. The bottles featured a sleeker design, smaller packaging labels, and a built-in grip. This design was dubbed &quot;Sidekick bottles&quot; and was said to be in testing in [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] markets. Currently, the bottles are being found more and more in the south-east region, and could potentially replace the standard bottle design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bevreview.com/2011/08/18/pepsicos-sidekick-bottle-for-mountain-dew/|title=News: PepsiCo's &quot;Sidekick&quot; Bottle for Mountain Dew|last=Tanner|first=Steve|date=18 August 2010|work=BevReview|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ingredients==
In its primary market of the United States, the ingredient composition of Mountain Dew is listed as: â[[carbonated water]], [[High-fructose corn syrup]] (in much of the U.S.), concentrated [[orange juice]], [[citric acid]], natural flavors, [[sodium benzoate]], [[caffeine]], [[Trisodium citrate|sodium citrate]], [[erythorbic acid]], [[gum arabic]], [[calcium disodium EDTA]], [[brominated vegetable oil]], and [[Tartrazine|yellow 5]].â&lt;ref name=dewingredientlist&gt;{{cite web|title=Pepsi Product Facts - Mountain Dew Ingredient List|url=http://pepsiproductfacts.com/infobyproduct.php?prod_size=20&amp;brand_fam_id=1049&amp;brand_id=1000&amp;product=Mountain+Dew&amp;prod_type=1026|publisher=PepsiCo, Inc.|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ingredient makeup of Mountain Dew varies based on the country of production. For example, in [[Canada]], the sweetener listed is &quot;fructose/sucrose&quot; and it is caffeine-free by default.&lt;ref name=dewcanadaingred&gt;{{cite news|last=Tanner|first=Steve|title=Mountain Dew Throwback (December 2009 Rerelease)|url=http://www.bevreview.com/2010/01/07/mountain-dew-throwback-december-2009-rerelease/|accessdate=28 January 2011|newspaper=BevReview|date=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to consumer insistence on a more natural product, PepsiCo in 2009 released a limited run production of Mountain Dew Throwback, a variation consisting of [[sugar]] in place of high fructose corn syrup.&lt;ref name=hfcs&gt;{{cite news|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=The decline and fall of high-fructose corn syrup|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2216796/|accessdate=27 January 2011|newspaper=Slate|date=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mountain Dew Throwback has since been re-released for brief periods (generally 8â12 weeks at a time), including a 2nd wave from December 2009 - February 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;throwback2nd&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bevreview.com/2010/01/07/mountain-dew-throwback-december-2009-rerelease/|title=Mountain Dew Throwback Â» December 2009 Rerelease|last=Tanner|first=Steve|date=7 January 2010|work=BevReview|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 3rd wave in Summer/Fall 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;throwback3rd&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bevreview.com/2010/06/16/throwback-thirds-pepsi-dew-throwback-to-return-for-3rd-run-in-august-for-5-weeks/|title=Pepsi, Dew Throwback to return for 3rd run in August for 5 weeks|last=Tanner|first=Steve|date=16 June 2010|work=BevReview|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 4th limited production run began in March 2011, lasting for a total of eight weeks before becoming a permanent addition to the Mountain Dew flavor line-up.&lt;ref name=limitedreleasestatus&gt;{{cite news|last=Tanner|first=Steve|title=Pepsi, Dew Throwback return in 2011 for 4th limited run, perhaps extended beyond 8 weeks|url=http://www.bevreview.com/2011/01/07/pepsi-dew-throwback-return-in-2011-for-4th-limited-run-perhaps-extended-beyond-8-weeks/|accessdate=27 January 2011|newspaper=BevReview|date=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two unfounded urban legends about Mountain Dew ingredients exist. One is that it causes shrunken testicles and/or penis size. The other is that it lowers sperm count.&lt;ref name=dewsp&gt;{{cite news|last=Mayer|first=Heather|title=Fact or Myth: Mountain Dew lowers sperm count|url=http://www.dailyorange.com/2.8656/fact-or-myth-mountain-dew-lowers-sperm-count-1.1234394|accessdate=27 January 2011|newspaper=The Daily Orange (Syracuse, NY)|date=6 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both myths are typically attributed to the dye Yellow #5 ([[tartrazine]]). Yellow #5 has never been scientifically linked to any of the alleged effects in the legends; nor has any other component of the drink. Thus, there is no evidence that Mountain Dew is any more hazardous (or beneficial) to health than other caffeinated, sugar-sweetened soft drinks, provided one is not allergic to Yellow #5.&lt;ref name=dewyellow5&gt;{{cite news|last=Pelisek|first=Christine|title=Offbeat: Mr. Happy Does the Dew|accessdate=27 January 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Weekly News|date=19 April 2000|url=http://laweekly.com/news/offbeat/mr-happy-does-the-dew/11480/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016184218/http://laweekly.com/news/offbeat/mr-happy-does-the-dew/11480/ |archivedate = 16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical Meanings==
[[File:Oldmtdewbottle.jpg|thumb|180px|An old 10 ounce Mountain Dew bottle (date unknown): &quot;It'll tickle yore innards!&quot; This design has been used for Mountain Dew Throwback since 2010.]]

'''Mountain Dew''' was originally Southern and/or Irish slang for [[moonshine]] (homemade whiskey), or [[poitÃ­n]] as it is called in [[Ireland]].
An [[1882]] song from Ireland &quot;[[The Rare Old Mountain Dew]]&quot; (Words by Edward Harrigan. Music by Dave Braham) begins:

:Let grasses grow and waters flow
:In a free and easy way,
:But give me enough of the rare ould stuff,
:That's made near Galway Bay,
:Come gougers all from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim too,
:And we'll give them the slip and we'll take a sip,
:Of the rare ould Mountain Dew.

A [[1947]] version by [[Grandpa Jones]] ([[1913]]-[[1998]]) may be better-known to Americans:

:There's a big holler tree down the road here from me
:where you lay down a doller er two.
:When you come round the bend and when you come back again
:there's a jug full of good old Mountain Dew
:Oh they call it that old mountain dew and them that refuse it are few.
:I'll shut up my mug if you fill up my jug with some good old Mountain Dew.

==Promotions==
===AMP Energy===
[[AMP Energy]] is an energy drink distributed by PepsiCo under the Mountain Dew brand. Launched in 2001, AMP was originally known as &quot;Mountain Dew AMP&quot;. From 2007â2008, several additional flavors of AMP were introduced.

===Taco Bell's Mountain Dew Baja Blast===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
Since 2004, Mountain Dew has offered Taco Bell stores the exclusive right to sell Mountain Dew Baja Blast, a tropical-lime-flavored variety of the popular soft drink. Since then, rumors have appeared on the internet saying that Baja Blast was going to be bottled and sold in stores. This has been confirmed as a hoax, as a contract existed between PepsiCo (owner of Mountain Dew) and Yum! brands (owner of Taco Bell) prohibiting its distribution anywhere outside of Taco Bell stores, giving Taco Bell the privilege of being the only provider of Baja Blast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bevreview.com/2004/07/30/review-mountain-dew-baja-blast/|title=Review: Mountain Dew Baja Blast|last=Tanner|first=Steve|date=30 July 2004|work=BevReview|accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, however, videos began appearing on the Dew Labs website of members finding Baja Blast in fountains at small markets outside of Taco Bell, meaning the contract is no longer valid. While this is still unconfirmed, it is a possible step towards Baja Blast joining the other flavors on shelves.

Online voters selected from three choices: Supernova (a strawberry-melon flavor), Revolution (a berry flavor), and Voltage (a raspberry-citrus flavor). Each included [[ginseng]]. On August 17, 2008, Voltage was announced as the winning flavor.

At the same time, 50 âDew fanaticsâ were chosen based on their video submissions to the video website 12seconds.tv, and were shipped boxes of the seven prototype flavors.&lt;ref name=12sec /&gt; From the initial seven flavors, taste testers were asked to elect three final flavors for later release at [[retail store]]s. The three new candidate flavors were Mountain Dew Typhoon (red-orange), a tropical [[strawberry]]-[[pineapple]] flavor, Mountain Dew White Out (white), described as a smooth [[citrus]] flavor, and Mountain Dew Distortion (green), a [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] flavor. The three new candidate flavors were released on April 19, 2010 and voting continued until June 14. The following day, White Out was announced as the winner. Mountain Dew White Out was officially released for sale on October 4, 2010. A limited production White Out [[Slurpee]] (Mtn Dew White Out Freeze) was made available at [[7-Eleven]] beginning in January 2011.&lt;ref name=dewslurpee2011&gt;{{cite news|first=Marvo|title=New Mountain Dew White Out Slurpee Might Be Less Xtreme Than An Actual Mountain Dew White Out|url=http://www.theimpulsivebuy.com/wordpress/2011/01/04/news-new-mountain-dew-white-out-slurpee-might-be-less-xtreme-than-an-actual-mountain-dew-white-out/|accessdate=27 January 2011|newspaper=The Impulsive Buy|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future====
Mountain Dew Marketing Director Brett O'Brien said in an interview that since the first two dewmocracy increased many sales, a third one may occur during the summer of 2012. This is of yet unconfirmed.

===Game Fuel===
====2007 Halo 3 edition====
In 2007, after using the term &quot;Game Fuel&quot; to direct their sodas to the video-gaming subculture, Mountain Dew officially announced a new flavor variant with the title. Coinciding with the release of the [[Xbox 360]] game [[Halo 3]], Mountain Dew Game Fuel sported a label that was almost entirely image-based, showing promotional artwork for the game and featuring the game series' main character [[Master Chief]] prominently. This variant remained on shelves for 12 weeks, and was discontinued afterwards.

====2009 World of Warcraft editions====
Two years later, the website for the popular [[MMORPG]] [[World of Warcraft]] was updated to reveal two Mountain Dew Game Fuel flavors would be coming to shelves in June 2009 and would promote the online video game. Shortly afterwards, official bottle art was released, and showed that one of the Game Fuel flavors would promote a certain player class in the game, while the other would promote a different class. It was also revealed that one of the two World of Warcraft Game Fuel flavors was exactly the same drink from the original Halo 3 promotion, with updated packaging. Both drinks were given World of Warcraft-based packaging, and sported the newly-updated &quot;MTN Dew&quot; logo. Like their precursor, these two flavors lasted for 12 weeks and were discontinued.

====2011 Modern Warfare 3 editions====
In early August 2011, an [[eBay]] auction was set up by a Pepsi employee for two unreleased flavors of Mountain Dew Game Fuel. Images of these two flavors showed that they were to promote the upcoming game [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]], that one of them would once again be the original Halo 3 flavor with updated packaging while the other would be a new, tropical-flavored drink (indicating it may be the Mystery flavor tested by Dew Labs members), and that they would be in stores in the near future. The auction ended on August 17, with the winning bid at $49.00 (plus $5.65 shipping charges). The status of these two flavors remained unconfirmed until August 24, when Mountain Dew officially announced the two flavors on their Facebook page, stating that they will return in October 2011 and will feature codes that grant players double experience points in-game. Both flavors were mailed out to Dew Labs members in early September 2011, a month before the planned release date. Later that same month, it was revealed through the Facebook page that Game Fuel would be arriving to the public in mid-October, though it would vary by market. Just as promised, Game Fuel began appearing as early as the first week of October, and was officially released as of October 10th.

====History====
Beginning in 2007, Mountain Dew put a small line of limited edition [[aluminum bottle]]s into limited-release production, featuring artwork from a range of [[tattoo artist]]s and other artists. This initial series marked the first use of the term''Green Label Art'' to describe the use of artistic works on Mountain Dew [[Packaging and labeling|product packaging]].&lt;ref name=arten&gt;{{cite news|title=Mountain Dew Limited Edition: Green Label Art|url=http://www.energyfiend.com/2007/05/mountain-dew-limited-edition-green-label-art|accessdate=19 January 2011|newspaper=Energy Fiend|date=18 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, a contest entitled âGreen Label Art: Shop Seriesâ was announced,&lt;ref name=heralddewtour&gt;{{cite news|last=Hammecker|first=Mike|title=Dew Tour: Green Label Shop Series|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/entertainment/art_scene/index.php/2010/06/24/dew-tour-green-label-shop-series/|accessdate=27 January 2011|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving 35 independent [[skateboard]] retail store owners who partnered with artists local to their areas in order to design and submit future can artwork designs.&lt;ref name=artdub&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Label Art, Volume 3, Presented by Mountain Dew|url=http://www.dubdaily.com/?p=14649|accessdate=27 January 2011|newspaper=DUB Daily|date=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one million votes were submitted by the conclusion of this contest in October of the same year, with Street Science Skate Shop â a store in [[Tracy, California|Tracy]], [[California]] â being named the winner of a cash prize.

Two variant flavors were current flavors that were introduced in diet form, four variant options were previously released flavors that were brought back in diet form, and two entirely new flavors and names were introduced: Diet Mountain Dew Flare (a berry citrus flavor) and Diet Mountain Dew Crave (a sweet and sour [[apple]] flavor). The two current flavors were Dewmocracy winners being introduced in diet form, Diet Mountain Dew White Out (a smooth citrus flavor) and Voltage (a raspberry-citrus flavor with a shot of ginseng for flavor enhancement), and the four returning flavors were Diet Mountain Dew Supernova (a strawberry-melon flavor), Distortion (a lime-citrus flavor), Typhoon (a strawberry-pineapple flavor), and Ultraviolet (a mixed berry flavor). Except for Ultraviolet (a former limited release flavor), the 3 other returning flavors were all previous Dewmocracy flavors that did not win. After many votes were cast, the finalists were diet versions of two of the three diet flavors that were newly introduced in the first DEWmocracy-Diet Voltage and Diet Supernova. The voting for these top two began March 6, 2011, when they were released in U.S. stores, pit stops, gas stations, and pharmacies for a limited duration of eight weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;dewsupernovavoltagemarch11&quot; /&gt; Diet Mountain Dew Supernova was the eventual winner and thus, it became a permanent Diet Mountain Dew flavor. This new flavor of Diet Mountain Dew will be returning to stores full-time pending a further announcement that shall be outlining exact dates.

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
====Pre-release====
On January 7, 2011, Mountain Dew posted on their Facebook that Pitch Black would return to the shelves on May 2011. It stated that this may be the start of many re-releases of old favorites. The Company promoted Pitch Black's return heavily with giveaways and contests. About a month before the planned release date, a photo was released on a Mountain Dew Company worker's Pongr, which showed Pitch Black and 2008's Supernova. Two weeks before the release, Dew Labs announced the return of 2010's Typhoon in 2-Liter bottles exclusively at Walmart Supercenters.

====Release====
The 3 flavors were officially rereleased to stores on the second of May in 2011 and continued until July. At the same time, Mtn Dew announced the Throwback Shack, which contained Mtn Dew Revolution, a flavor long gone. It was widely spectated by DEW fans that Revolution would return next year. The spectation ended in July 25th, when the Back by Popular Dewmand promotion ended.

====End====
It was officially stated by the official &quot;Back By Popular DEWmand&quot; Facebook page on July 25 that the promotion had ended. The promotional advertisements were then taken down from the official Mountain Dew website. On a later date, Mountain Dew then confirmed via tweet that there would not be any more flavors returning 'by Popular DEWmand' for now, as it was only intended to be a summer program. They also stated that there were currently no plans to re-release Revolution, but they also had the quote &quot;we never say never&quot;.

==Flavors and varieties==
Following the success of Code Red in 2001, over 30 subsequent flavors bearing the &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; name have been introduced, such as LiveWire, an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]]-flavored variation, Pitch Black, a [[grape]]-flavored variation that was produced seasonally prior to [[Halloween]], and Typhoon, a strawberry-pineapple flavored variation that came in second in DEWmocracy 2: Collective Intelligence. This is a table covering them all.

Produced in a lemon and lime flavor, it has a higher caffeine content as Mountain Dew sold in the [[U.S.]], at 18&amp;nbsp;mg per 100ml,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=267482964 Tesco - Mountain Dew Energy&lt;/ref&gt; versus 91&amp;nbsp;mg per 20 fl oz in the U.S. version&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pepsicobeveragefacts.com/infobyproduct.php?prod_type=1026&amp;prod_size=20&amp;brand_fam_id=1049&amp;brand_id=1000&amp;product=Mountain+Dew PepsiCo beverage facts - Mtn Dew&lt;/ref&gt; (which is ~15.385&amp;nbsp;mg per 100ml). The UK version is produced with real sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, as with most other soft drinks in the UK. Mountain Dew did initially launch in the UK and the Republic of Ireland in 1996; however it was discontinued in 1998 due to low sales volumes at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ukdewlaunch&quot; /&gt;  Mountain Dew Energy has been designed specifically for periods of mental and physical exertion, just like the original Mountain Dew distributed in the US.  The high (compared to regular soft drinks) level of caffeine and sugar gives much the same &quot;boost&quot; as other caffeine-heavy energy drinks, making the drink particularly popular with 16-24 year olds. The drink is produced by [[Britvic]] in the UK. The original Mountain Dew is only available either from eBay, Amazon, Selfridges or other specialist importers such as [http://www.americansweets.co.uk Stateside Candy].

! scope=&quot;row&quot; | Adrenaline Mountain Dew
|2010 â present
|In August 2010, this new flavor was released to [[Poland]] and possibly other polish-speaking countries. Much like previous attempts, Adrenaline is marketed as a Mountain Dew energy drink, and contains things such as [[caffeine]], [[taurine]], [[guarana]] extract, [[ginseng]], and vitamins B2 and B12. The drink is available in 250 ml cans, and also in an undetermined size of black-tinted bottles (similar to Mountain Dew Energy's green-tinted bottles). Because the drink is fairly recent and not available in English-speaking countries, not much is known of it as of yet.
