The '''University of Central Oklahoma''', often referred to as '''UCO''', is a [[coeducational]] [[public university]] located in [[Edmond, Oklahoma]]. The [[university]] is the third largest in Oklahoma, with almost 18,000 students and approximately 434 full-time and 400 adjunct faculty. Founded in 1890,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uco.edu/about/history.asp&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Central Oklahoma was one of the first institutions of higher learning to be established in what would become the state of [[Oklahoma]], making it one of the oldest [[universities]] in the southwest region of the [[United States of America]].
It is home to the Academy of Contemporary Music staffed by members of the rock band The Flaming Lips. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111865566&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognized the University of Central Oklahoma as the 2009-2010 Individual Conference Champion for using more [[green power]] than any other school in the [[Lone Star Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/bf3d4f51857c10d08525770a004f998d?OpenDocument |title=04/19/2010: University of Central Oklahoma Receives Green Power Partnership Individual Conference Champion Award |publisher=Yosemite.epa.gov |date=2010-04-19 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edmondsun.com/ulife/x563635563/UCO-wins-award-from-EPA |title=UCO wins award from EPA Â» University Life |publisher=The Edmond Sun |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The University of Central Oklahoma was founded on December 24, 1890, when the Territorial Legislature voted to establish the Territorial Normal School,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucok.edu/about_uco.htm&lt;/ref&gt; making UCO the oldest public institution of higher education in Oklahoma. Classes were first held in November 1891, whereas Oklahoma A&amp;M College held its first classes in December 1891 and the University of Oklahoma began in fall 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v008/v008p094.html |title=Chronicles of Oklahoma |publisher=Digital.library.okstate.edu |date=1930-03-01 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/U/UN009.html |title=University Of Central Oklahoma |publisher=Digital.library.okstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= National register of historic places | url=http://www.visitedmondok.com/historicalplaces.htm | publisher=Edmond CVB | accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Territorial Legislature located the new school in Edmond, provided certain conditions were met. First, [[Oklahoma County]] had to donate $5,000 in bonds, and Edmond had to donate {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of land within one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) of the town; the land was eventually donated by Anton Classen. Ten of those acres had to be set aside for the new school. The remaining land had to be divided into lots which would be sold to raise money for the new school. On Oct. 1, 1891 Richard Thatcher was elected the 1st President of Territorial Normal School of Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UCO Archives - University Time Line| url=http://library.uco.edu/archives/page-files/university-time-line.asp | publisher=University of Central Oklahoma | accessdate=2008-05-11 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions all were met, with the city of Edmond donating an additional $2,000 in bonds. The first class, a group of 23 students, met for the first time Nov. 1, 1891, in the Epworth League Room, located in the unfurnished First Methodist Church. A marker of Oklahoma granite was placed in 1915 near the original site by the Central Oklahoma Normal School Historical Society. It can be seen at Boulevard and Second Street.

Old North Tower was the first building constructed in the summer of 1892 on the campus of what was then Territorial Normal School.  Occupancy began Jan. 3, 1893. The school first operated as a [[normal school]] with two years of college work and a complete preparatory school. In 1897, the first graduating class&amp;mdash;two men and three women&amp;mdash;received their Normal School [[diplomas]].

[[File:Oldnorth4.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Old North in 2008]]

In 1904, Territorial Normal became Central State Normal School. Statehood was still three years away. On Dec. 29, 1919, the State Board of Education passed a resolution making Central a four-year teachersâ college conferring bachelor's degrees. From 1901 until 1961, UCO housed a laboratory school in which local elementary schoolchildren were schooled by UCO faculty and soon-to-be teaching graduates.

Two years later, the Class of 1921 had nine members, the first graduates to receive the four-year degrees. Two decades later, Central State Teacher's College became Central State College. In 1939, the [[Oklahoma Legislature]] authorized the institution to grant both [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees.

On March 11, 1941, Central State became part of a coordinated state system of post-secondary education overseen by the Oklahoma Regents for Higher Education, and joined institutions with similar missions as a regional institution.
 
In 1954, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education gave Central permission to offer the Master of Teaching Degree, which became the [[Master of Education]] in 1969. In 1971, the college was authorized to grant the [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] in English and the [[Master of Business Administration]] degrees.

On April 13, 1971, the state legislature officially changed the institution's name to Central State University. Old North Tower was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.
On May 18, 1990, during the university's Centennial Year, legislation was passed changing the name to the University of Central Oklahoma, though many of the students still refer to the University as &quot;Central&quot; or &quot;Central State.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=UCO Archives - History | url=http://library.uco.edu/archives/page-files/university-time-line.asp | publisher=University of Central Oklahoma | accessdate=2008-05-11 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
