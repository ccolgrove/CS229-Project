The '''[[Kraken]]''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[sea monster]] in the [[Pirates of the Caribbean films|''Pirates of the Caribbean'' film series]]. The monster made its first appearance in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' as an [[antagonist]] portrayed through [[Computer-generated imagery]]. Although a creation of [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' and designed by the film's producers, the Kraken is heavily based on the [[mythology|mythological]] creature featured in [[Scandinavians|Scandinavian]] nautical lore [[Kraken|by the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', second disc, &quot;Creating the Kraken&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Disney Pictures]] also became the first studio to produce this mythological creature using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]. The Kraken makes a final small, though symbolic, appearance in the third film in the series, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'', Ch.10&lt;/ref&gt;

In the films, the Kraken is a sea creature of monstrous proportions that is controlled by [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]], supernatural ruler of the ocean realms. When commanded, it destroys anything Davy Jones desires. The Kraken is used often by Jones to destroy ships that threaten him. One of the Kraken's most powerful weapons is fear, which can be used to keep a foe at bay, eliminating the threat altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caribbean page 72&quot;&gt;''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide'', page 72, &quot;The Kraken&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__
==Film production==
There are different pronunciations of Kraken. [[Kevin McNally]] ([[Mr. Gibbs]]) pronounced it {{pron-en|ËkrÃ¦kÉn}} {{respell|KRAK|Én}}, so that pronunciation was adopted on set.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Kraken was difficult to animate as it had no real-life reference, until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' which had a real octopus crawling over miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rebecca Murray | title = Behind the Scenes of the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; Movies | publisher = [[About.com]] | date = 2006-11-03 | url = http://movies.about.com/od/piratesofthecaribbean2/a/pirates113006.htm | accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of the attacks, [[Keira Knightley]] ([[Elizabeth Swann]]) divulged that &quot;the Kraken, at the moment, is just Gore [Verbinski] running around, going, 'I'm a tentacle. I'm a tentacle. Be afraid.'&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} [[Gore Verbinski]] worked with [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] to create the scenes for the film involving the Kraken. When filming the attack on the ''Edinburgh Trader'', they used the ship as a set in shallow waters. Many more [[sailors]] were digitally added on board the ship, and others were digitally replaced for complex shots. When the time came to film the ''Edinburgh Trader'' being broken in half, two massive pipes were filled with 30,000 pounds of [[cement]] for a total of 60,000 pounds and crushed down onto the set. To prepare for this event, most metal and the masts were removed, because the metal would prevent the ship from satisfyingly breaking in half while the masts would prevent better camera close-ups. Furthermore, the interior middle of the ship was lined with cables of explosives to blast the wood apart in the air. After the shot, other men were filmed on another blue tilting set and digitally added on deck. [[John Knoll]], Visual Effects Supervisor, confessed that it was extremely complex to add the Kraken's tentacles between all the environmental effects of water and wood debris.&lt;ref name=&quot;CreatingTheKraken&quot;&gt;{{cite video | title = Creating the Kraken | format = DVD | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] |date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the time came to film [[Jack Sparrow]] in front of the Kraken's maw, [[Johnny Depp]]'s stand-in, Scott Sener, was used to experiment with what worked best with the slime at their disposal (which would represent the [[phlegm]] of the Kraken). The slime was spattered about him with jets of air. For the actual filming, [[Johnny Depp|Depp]] was spattered with the slime and acted his part without any representation for the Kraken. It was afterward digitally added along with sound, tentacles, and other [[visual effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CreatingTheKraken&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
Nothing is revealed in the films about the Kraken's origins. What is known is that after [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] cut out his heart,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' Ch.11&lt;/ref&gt; and became the feared and mutated sea ruler, he presumably found the Kraken and came to command it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Ch.19&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the Kraken was used by Jones to destroy ships that blocked his path or those that carried potential crew members for his supernatural ship, the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]''. In ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', it is summoned by the men of the [[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]] turning a [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]] that drops a large, wooden mechanism into the water creating something similar to a [[depth charge]], reverberating across the water supposedly for miles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Ch.12&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also known that this Kraken was the last of its kind.

==Appearances==
===''Dead Man's Chest''===
{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest}}
The Kraken first appears in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', brought to life using the most advanced [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) from [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]. [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]], who seeks [[Jack Sparrow]]'s soul to recoup a debt, dispatches [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]] to deliver Sparrow the ''[[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|Black Spot]]'' and announce that Jones' &quot;terrible [[leviathan]]&quot; is stalking him.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Ch.4&lt;/ref&gt; When a Turkish sailor retrieves Sparrow's lost hat from the sea, he unwittingly calls the Kraken.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; A large green mass silently rushes toward the fishing boat; moments later, the monster violently yanks it underwater in mere seconds. Then the Kraken attacks another ship and [[Will Turner]] boards the wreckage that's left, after [[Jack Sparrow]] deceives him into believing it is the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]''; the surviving crew members have been left psychologically traumatized by the Kraken's attack.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

[[Image:Pirates04 Pirates2-kb365-23.jpg|thumb|300px|The Kraken destroys the ''Edinburgh Trader'']]
[[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] later summons the Kraken to destroy the ''[[Edinburgh Trader]]'', a merchant ship that rescues [[Will Turner]]. The Kraken smashes the vessel in half with two of its massive tentacles, killing nearly all the crew. While he is momentarily submerged underwater, Will briefly glimpses the gargantuan monster.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

When the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' falls behind the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' during a chase, Jones calls upon the Kraken to finish it off. The Kraken glides its tentacles up the ''Pearl's'' hull. Based upon his previous experience aboard the ''Edinburgh Trader'', Will quickly devises a strategic defense and orders the crew to fire the deck guns into the monster's tentacles, severely wounding them and forcing the Kraken to momentarily retreat,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Ch.25&lt;/ref&gt; but returns and smashes the cannons before attacking the rest of the ship.  [[Will Turner|Will]] then has kegs of gun powder, rum, and other combustibles loaded into a cargo net and hoisted aloft. When the Kraken returns, [[Jack Sparrow|Sparrow]] shoots the barrels, blasting the monster's tentacles in the resulting explosion: the wounded Kraken again withdraws.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Sparrow, knowing the Kraken, now angrier than ever, will attack again, then orders the crew to abandon ship.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Ch.26&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that the Kraken is only hunting Sparrow, Elizabeth uses trickery to chain him to the mast, then escapes with the crew.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Kraken makes its final assault just after Sparrow frees himself, with Sparrow's sword pointing at it after his hat is vomited from it's mouth; he says, &quot;Hello, Beastie,&quot; after which the Kraken drags Sparrow and the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' to [[Davy Jones' Locker]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===''At World's End''===
{{Main|Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End}}

The Kraken is briefly seen in the film, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]''; but it has been killed by Davy Jones under Lord Beckett's command. Beckett feared that Jones, being a [[loose cannon]], might command the Kraken to attack the [[East India Trading Company]] armada. Jones, threatened with having his heart shot by the soldiers, did as commanded. The action profoundly affected him, however, as seen in his facial expression when Beckett reminds him about the killing. Jones even plays a sad tune on his [[pipe organ]] for his dead [[pet]], and also for his lost love, Calypso.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'', Ch.15&lt;/ref&gt; It is never revealed how Jones killed the Kraken, although the finding of a dead pirate with a black-spot on his hand, would suggest that the Kraken was lured onto the beach of an island, and, bereft of water, drowned in air.
After [[Jack Sparrow]] is rescued from Davy Jones' Locker, he proclaims his desire to become &quot;Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; When Sparrow and [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]] go ashore for fresh water, they find the Kraken's carcass washed up on the island's beach, a notable [[sadness]] in its dead eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Observing Jack's reaction as he surveys the dead monster, Barbossa tells him that being the last of anything means that eventually there will be none left at all. Jack finally realizes the enormity of [[Cutler Beckett|Lord Beckett]]'s threat to exterminate all pirates, and he agrees to attend the Brethren Court on Shipwreck Island with Barbossa.

==Attributes==
===Physical characteristics===


The Kraken was designed by the producers of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', and then was brought to life by technicians at [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]. Its body resembles a massive, [[cuttlefish]]-like [[cephalopod]]. In the [[book]], ''Pirates of the Caribbean: A Visual Guide'',  a profile view of the Kraken is seen, with a ship for scale. The second edition, ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide'', states the Kraken to be as long as ten of that ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caribbean page 72&quot;/&gt; The book also depicts the Kraken as a [[cephalopod]]-like beast, with a ring of tentacles at the base of its [[head]] and a long, sharp [[tail]] similar to a squid (this could be used to keep it at level with the ship underwater).&lt;ref name=&quot;Caribbean page 72&quot;/&gt; The fictional monster has also large round eyes with orange irises and black pupils.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Interestingly, the eyes seem to show pain, most likely from when Jones had to kill it, although it could also be the Kraken's default expression. The Kraken in this shot does not look as big as the given photo from the visual guide.

Its massive, sucker-lined tentacles are said by Mr. Gibbs to, &quot;suction your [[face]] clean off&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; The suction disks are powerful enough to pull down a ship from its underside and have contorted a human's face to the point of leaving it smothered by its own skin in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; The Kraken also uses these powerful suckers to silently pull itself along the rocks lying on the oceans' bottom, much as does an [[octopus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Caribbean page 72&quot;/&gt; After the Kraken's [[tentacle]]s were severely damaged by [[cannon]] [[fire]] and an explosion during the assaults on ''[[Black Pearl]]'', it resurfaced with its wounds appearing healed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It is unclear if the Kraken has the ability to instantly regenerate itself or if it was using different tentacles. It is also notable that the Kraken has two forearms significantly larger than the others, like the hunting tentacles possessed by squids and cuttlefish. The beast employs these to crush ships.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The weight of the two tentacles can split a ship along its width.

When it revealed its mouth to character [[Jack Sparrow]], it resembled a [[Sarlacc]]; the interior is lined with over six sets of spiked teeth and its [[breath]] emits a reeking odor of &quot;a thousand rotting corpses&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Jack, however, is not at all daunted by the foul breath claiming it is &quot;Not so bad,&quot; and deliberately leaps into the Kraken's jaws, trying to kill it.

====Summoning the Kraken====

[[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]], ruler of the seas, summons the Kraken to destroy vessels. On-board his ghostly ship, the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' is a massive capstan with a carved Kraken on the top, the so-called ''Kraken's Hammer''. To call the Kraken, the crew rotate the [[capstan (nautical)|capstan]] clockwise, lifting it to its highest point. It then slams down, blasting [[shock wave|shockwaves]] through the ocean, thus summoning the Kraken. One shockwave usually does the job unless the Kraken is farther away. The Kraken Hammer is seen again in ''At Worlds End'', still aboard the ''Dutchman''; though broken and unusable, it is still able to rotate, as shown during Sparrow and Jones' duel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; The lines chanted by Davy Jones as the Kraken is summoned (&quot;...And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake...The Kraken!&quot;) are similar to the lines from the [[Book of Job]]: &quot;Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therin. Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.&quot;

The Kraken attacks anyone marked with the Black Spot,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; which is delivered to its victims by ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'' crewmen and can only be removed by its captain, [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Ch.13&lt;/ref&gt; According to the writers' commentary on the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' DVD, those marked with the Black Spot are taken by the Kraken to [[Davy Jones' Locker (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones' Locker]], where they must experience their worst fears for eternity.

===Methods of attack===
The Kraken attacks by stealthily approaching a ship, slithering its tentacles up the hull's sides, and gripping tightly, yanking it underwater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caribbean page 72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; If the crew can fight back, the Kraken smashes the hull and masts with its tentacles, probing the decks and holds with its sensitive suckers seeking out its prey.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The destruction is catastrophic, and its two forearms are so powerful it can easily rip a ship apart in mere seconds.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Davy Jones uses some, but not all, these attacks to acquire new crewmen for the ''[[Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; As he surveys one wrecked ship's survivors, he offers them an opportunity to delay their final judgment by joining his crew for 100 years. Those who refuse are killed and thrown over-board.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; A somewhat notable aspect is that the Kraken displays a degree of intelligence. When it was hurt by the Black Pearl's cannons, it was sure to get rid of them when it attacked them again.

Kraken attacks often leave the survivors, if any, psychologically damaged, traumatized or deranged.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', Ch.12. Pg 393&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a survivor is left without a face, it having been contorted by the suckers. Also, the Kraken appeared to have eaten at least six of the crew-members of the ''Edinburgh Trader''.
