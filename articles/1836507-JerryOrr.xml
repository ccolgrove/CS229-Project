The '''Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization''' or '''PATCO''' was a [[United States]] [[trade union]] that operated from 1968 until its [[decertification]] in 1981 following a strike that was broken by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]]. The 1981 strike and defeat of PATCO has been called &quot;one of the most important events in late twentieth century U.S. labor history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCartin&quot;&gt;{{cite |last=McCartin |first=Joseph A. |editor=Eric Arnesen |title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-class History |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zEWsZ81Bd3YC|chapter=Professional Air Traffic Controllers Strike (1981) |year=2006 |publisher=CRC Press |pages=1123â1126 |isbn=0415968267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PATCO was founded in 1968 with the assistance of attorney and pilot [[F. Lee Bailey]]. On July 3, 1968, PATCO flexed its muscles by announcing &quot;Operation Air Safety&quot; in which all members were ordered to adhere strictly to the established (though impractical){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} separation standards for aircraft. The resultant large delay of air traffic was the first of many official and unofficial &quot;slowdowns&quot; that PATCO would initiate.

In 1969 the U.S. Civil Service Commission ruled that PATCO was no longer a professional association but in fact a trade union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nolan&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Nolan |first=Michael S. |title=Fundamentals of air traffic control |edition=3rd |publisher=Brooks/Cole |location=Pacific Grove, California |date=1999 |isbn=9780534567958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 25, 1970, the newly designated union orchestrated a controller &quot;[[sickout]]&quot; to protest many of the FAA actions that they felt were unfair; over 2,000 controllers around the country did not report to work as scheduled and informed management that they were ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,943943,00.html |title=One Man's Slow-Motion Aerial Act |work=[[Time (magazine)]] |date=1970-04-06 |accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controllers called in sick to circumvent the federal law against strikes by government unions. Management personnel attempted to assume many of the duties of the missing controllers but major traffic delays around the country occurred. After a few days, the federal courts intervened and most controllers went back to work by order of the court, but the government was forced to the bargaining table. The sickout led officials to recognize that the ATC system was operating nearly at capacity. To alleviate some of this, Congress accelerated the installation of automated systems, reopened the air traffic controller training academy in Oklahoma City, began hiring air traffic controllers at an increasing rate, and raised salaries to help attract and retain controllers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nolan&quot; /&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], PATCO (along with the [[Teamsters]] and the [[Air Line Pilots Association]]) refused to back President [[Jimmy Carter]], instead [[political endorsement|endorsing]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Ronald Reagan]]. PATCO's refusal to endorse the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] stemmed in large part from poor labor relations with the FAA (the employer of PATCO members) under the Carter administration and Ronald Reagan's endorsement of the union and its struggle for better conditions during the 1980 election campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beik&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Beik |first=Mildred A. |title=Labor Relations |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group | location=Westport, Connecticut |date=2005 |pages=249â257 |isbn=0313318646 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ji9Ro-oHjjkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fantasia&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Fantasia |first=Rick |coauthors=Kim Voss |title=Hard Work: Remaking the American Labor Movement |publisher=University of California Press |date=2004 |location=Berkeley |page=67 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Wc0tGBsQRNkC |isbn=0520240901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Reagan speaks on air traffic controllers strike 1981.jpg|thumb|200px|right|On August 3, 1981, during a press conference regarding the PATCO strike, President Reagan stated: &quot;They are in violation of the law and if they do not report for work within 48 hours they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated.&quot;]]
On August 3, 1981, the union [[strike action|declared]] a strike, seeking better working conditions, better pay and a 32-hour workweek. In addition, PATCO no longer wanted to be included within the [[civil service]] clauses that had haunted it for decades. In doing so, the union violated a law &amp;mdash; 5 U.S.C. (Supp. III 1956) 118p. &amp;mdash; that banned strikes by government unions. Ronald Reagan declared the PATCO strike a &quot;peril to national safety&quot; and ordered them back to work under the terms of the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947. Only 1,300 of the nearly 13,000 controllers returned to work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beik&quot; /&gt; Subsequently, Reagan demanded those remaining on strike return to work within 48 hours, otherwise their jobs would be forfeited. At the same time, Transportation Secretary [[Drew Lewis]] organized for replacements and started contingency plans. By prioritizing and cutting flights severely, and even adopting methods of air traffic management that PATCO had previously lobbied for, the government was initially able to have 50% of flights available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beik&quot; /&gt;

On August 5, following the PATCO workers' refusal to return to work, Reagan fired the 11,345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored the order,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/07/31/an_old_lesson_still_holds_for_unions/ |title=An old lesson still holds for unions |last=Early |first=Steve |date=2006-07-31 |publisher=The Boston Globe |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,962487,00.html |title=Unhappy Again |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=1986-10-06 |accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and banned them from federal service for life. (This ban was later rescinded by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1993.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Van Horn&quot;&gt;{{cite |last=Van Horn |first=Carl E. |last2=Schaffner |first2=Herbert A. |title=Work in America: an encyclopedia of history, policy, and society, Volume 2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vsCeCHxH7jQC |chapter=Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization Strike |year=2003| publisher=ABC-CLIO |pages=444â446 |isbn=1576076768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the strike and mass firings the FAA was faced with the task of hiring and training enough controllers to replace those that had been fired, a hard problem to fix as at the time it took three years in normal conditions to train a new controller.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nolan&quot; /&gt; They were replaced initially with nonparticipating controllers, supervisors, staff personnel, some nonrated personnel, and in some cases by controllers transferred temporarily from other facilities. Some military controllers were also used until replacements could be trained. The FAA had initially claimed that staffing levels would be restored within two years; however, it would take closer to ten years before the overall staffing levels returned to normal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nolan&quot; /&gt; PATCO was [[decertification|decertified]] from its right to represent workers by the [[Federal Labor Relations Authority]] on October 22, 1981. The decision was appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Patco Decertification Vote Is Switched From 2-1 to 3-0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1981-11-05 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE5DF1E39F936A35752C1A967948260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fA%2fAir%20Traffic%20Control |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some former striking controllers were allowed to reapply after 1986 and were rehired; they and their replacements are now represented by the [[National Air Traffic Controllers Association]], which was organized in 1987 and had no connection with PATCO.

==Legacy==
In 2003, [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Alan Greenspan]], speaking on the legacy of Ronald Reagan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/200304092/default.htm The Reagan Legacy: Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan] Ronald Reagan Library, Simi Valley, California, April 9, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; noted: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Perhaps the most important, and then highly controversial, domestic initiative was the firing of the air traffic controllers in August 1981. The President invoked the law that striking government employees forfeit their jobs, an action that unsettled those who cynically believed no President would ever uphold that law. President Reagan prevailed, as you know, but far more importantly his action gave weight to the legal right of private employers, previously not fully exercised, to use their own discretion to both hire and discharge workers.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Trade unions representing air traffic controllers==
In addition to the [[National Air Traffic Controllers Association]], two organizations now claim the name and part or all of the jurisdiction of the original PATCO: [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (AFSCME)]] and [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (2003)]].
