'''Mathematica''' is a computational software program used in scientific, engineering, and mathematical fields and other areas of technical computing. It was conceived by [[Stephen Wolfram]] and is developed by [[Wolfram Research]] of [[Champaign, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_40/b3953024.htm Stephen Wolfram: Simple Solutions; The iconoclastic physicist's Mathematica software nails complex puzzles], BusinessWeek, October 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfram.com/company/contact.cgi Wolfram Research Contact Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the program &quot;Mathematica&quot; was suggested to Stephen Wolfram by Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs-a-few-memories/#more-15338&lt;/ref&gt; although Stephen Wolfram had thought about it earlier.

== Interface ==
Mathematica is split into two parts, the [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and the [[Front and back ends|front end]]. The kernel interprets expressions (Mathematica code) and returns result expressions.

The front end, designed by [[Theodore Gray]], provides a [[GUI]], which allows the creation and editing of Notebook documents containing program code with [[prettyprint]]ing, formatted text together with results including [[Formula editor|typeset mathematics]], graphics, GUI components, tables, and sounds. All contents and formatting can be generated algorithmically or interactively edited. Most standard word processing capabilities are supported, but there is only one level of &quot;undo.&quot;

Documents can be structured using a hierarchy of cells, which allow for outlining and sectioning of a document and support automatic numbering index creation. Documents can be presented in a slideshow environment for presentations. Notebooks and their contents are represented as Mathematica expressions that can be created, modified or analysed by Mathematica programs. This allows conversion to other formats such as [[TeX]] or [[XML]].

The front end includes development tools such as a debugger, input completion and automatic syntax coloring.  

The standard front end is used by default, but alternative front ends are available.  They include the Wolfram Workbench, an [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] based [[Integrated development environment|IDE]], introduced in 2006. It provides project-based code development tools for Mathematica, including revision management, debugging, profiling, and testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/06/21/workbench/index.php MacWorld review of Wolfram Workbench]&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematica also includes a command line front end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/UsingATextBasedInterface.html Using a Text-Based Interface] documentation at wolfram.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== High-performance computing ==
In recent years, the capabilities for [[high-performance computing]] have been extended with the introduction of [[packed array]]s (version 4, 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/premium/0199/0199-1526706.html Math software packs new power; new programs automate such tedious processes as solving nonlinear differential equations and converting units] by Agnes Shanley, ''Chemical Engineering'', March 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sparse matrices]] (version 5, 2003),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9587712_ITM Mathematica 5.1: additional features make software well-suited for operations research professionals] by ManMohan S. Sodhi, ''OR/MS Today'', December 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and by adopting the [[GNU Multi-Precision Library]] to evaluate high-precision arithmetic.

Version 5.2 (2005) added automatic [[Thread (computer science)|multi-threading]] when computations are performed on [[multi-core]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-12336000_ITM The 21st annual Editors' Choice Awards], Macworld, February 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This release included CPU specific optimized libraries. In addition Mathematica is supported by third party specialist acceleration hardware such as [[ClearSpeed]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/ClearSpeed+Advance(TM)+Accelerator+Boards+Certified+by+Wolfram...-a0147498410 ClearSpeed Advance(TM) Accelerator Boards Certified by Wolfram Research; Math Coprocessors Enable Mathematica Users to Quadruple Performance.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[gridMathematica]] was introduced to allow user level [[Parallel computing|parallel programming]] on heterogeneous clusters and multiprocessor systems &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/news/2002/11/20/mathematica/index.php gridMathematica offers parallel computing solution] by Dennis Sellers, MacWorld, November 20, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 parallel computing technology was included in all Mathematica licenses including support for grid technology such as [[Windows HPC Server 2008]], [[Windows Server 2003|Microsoft Compute Cluster Server]] and [[Sun Grid]].

Support for [[CUDA]] and [[OpenCL]] [[GPU]] hardware was added in 2010. Also, version 8 can generate [[C (programming language)|C]] code, which is automatically compiled by a system C compiler, such as [[Intel C++ Compiler]] or compiler of [[Visual Studio 2010]].

== Development ==
Several solutions are available for deploying applications written in Mathematica:
*Mathematica Player Pro is a runtime version of Mathematica that will run any Mathematica application but does not allow editing or creation of the code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/mathematica-player-pro-new-application-delivery-system-for-mathematica/9096/ Mathematica Player Pro - new Application Delivery System for Mathematica] www.gizmag.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
*A [[gratis versus libre|free-of-charge]] version, ''Wolfram [[CDF Player]]'', is provided for running Mathematica programs that have been saved in the [[Computable Document Format]] (CDF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolfram.com/cdf Computable Document Format for Interactive Content]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also view standard Mathematica files, but not run them. It includes plugins for common web browsers.
*webMathematica allows a web browser to act as a front end to a remote Mathematica server. It is designed to allow a user written application to be remotely accessed via a browser on any platform. It may not be used to give full access to Mathematica.
*Mathematica code can be converted to C code or to an automatically generated DLL.

== Connections with other applications ==
Communication with other applications occurs through a protocol called [http://www.wolfram.com/solutions/mathlink/mathlink.html MathLink]. It allows communication between the Mathematica kernel and front-end, and also provides a general interface between the kernel and other applications.

Although Mathematica has a large array of functionality, a number of interfaces to other software have been developed, for use where other programs have functionality that Mathematica does not provide, to enhance those applications, or to access legacy code.

Wolfram Research freely distributes a developer kit for linking applications written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] to the Mathematica kernel through ''MathLink''.&lt;ref name=&quot;accessmylibrary.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9256461_ITM New Mathematica: faster, leaner, linkable and QuickTime-compatible: MathLink kit allows ties to other apps. (Wolfram Research Inc. ships Mathematica 2.1, new QuickTime-compatible version of Mathematica software)] by Daniel Todd, MacWeek, June 15, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using ''.NET/Link''.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfram.com/solutions/mathlink/netlink/ .NET/Link]: .NET/Link is a toolkit that integrates Mathematica and the Microsoft .NET Framework.&lt;/ref&gt; a .NET program can ask Mathematica to perform computations; likewise, a Mathematica program can load .NET [[class (computer science)|classes]], manipulate .NET objects and perform method calls. This makes it possible to build .NET [[graphical user interface]]s from within Mathematica. Similar functionality is achieved with ''J/Link''.,&lt;ref name=&quot;macworld.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/2002/11/reviews/mathematica/ Mathematica 4.2] by Charles Seiter, ''Macworld'', November 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; but with Java programs instead of .NET programs.

Communication with [[SQL]] databases is achieved through built-in support for [[JDBC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.databasejournal.com/news/article.php/3453911 Mathematica 5.1 Available ], Database Journal, Jan 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematica can also install [[web services]] from a [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] description.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/Math/Documents/Notes/services.xml Mathematical Web Services: W3C Note 1 August 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/WebServices/tutorial/Introduction.html Introduction to Web Services], Mathematica Web Services Tutorial&lt;/ref&gt;

Other languages that connect to Mathematica include [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mathlink Haskell packages]&lt;/ref&gt; [[AppleScript]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unisoftwareplus.com/products/mathlinkosax/ Unisoftware plus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racket_(programming_language)|Racket]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utah.edu/~czhu/SchemeLink/mrmma.html MrMathematica website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Visual Basic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/TechNotes/4710/ Mathematica for ActivX]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Python (programming language)|Python]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dkbza.org/pythonika.html Pythonika MathLink module for Python]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/585/   PYML (Python Mathematica interface)]&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Clojure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://clojuratica.weebly.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Links are available to many specialized mathematical software packages including [[OpenOffice.org Calc]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauschkeconsulting.com/calclink.html CalcLink] Lauschke Consulting&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Excel]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfram.com/products/applications/excel_link/] Mathematica Link for Excel&lt;/ref&gt; [[MATLAB]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/6044-mathematica-symbolic-toolbox-for-matlab-version-2-0 Mathematica Toolbox for Matlab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/618/ Mathsource item #618 for calling MATLAB from Mathematica] Roger Germundsson from [[Wolfram Research]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[R_Statistics|R]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceops.com/Rlink2.asp R-Link]  Calling [[R_Statistics|R]] from within Mathematica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/Conferences/6510/ Using [[R_Statistics|R]]'s functionality with Mathematica] Wolfram Technology Conference in 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sage_(mathematics_software)|Sage]],&lt;ref&gt;http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/Mathematica/Sage/ Calling Sage from Mathematica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/Mathematica/Sage/UsingSage.nb A Mathematica notebook to call [[Sage_(mathematics_software)|Sage]] from Mathematica.&lt;/ref&gt; [[SINGULAR]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/people/mkauers/publications/kauers06m.pdf] Manuel Kauers and Viktor Levandovskyy of the [[Johannes_Kepler_University_Linz|Johannes Kepler University in Austria]] &lt;/ref&gt; [[MathModelica]] and [[Origin_(software)|Origin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronicdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/1323/1323.html * Interface Links Origin And Mathematica Software] Electronic Design&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical equations can be exchanged with other computational or typesetting software via [[MathML]].

Mathematica can capture real-time data via a link to [[LabView]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bettervi.com/mlink/index.html Mathematica Link to Labview] BetterView Consulting&lt;/ref&gt; from financial feeds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lauschkeconsulting.com/ddfplus.html DDFLink] Lauschke Consulting&lt;/ref&gt; and directly from hardware devices via GPIB (IEEE 488),&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitm/ GITM] SourceForge&lt;/ref&gt; [[USB]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolfram.com/news/btoptools.html BTopTools] A commercial interface to USB devices&lt;/ref&gt; and serial interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/6380/ Interfacing Hardware with Mathematica]&lt;/ref&gt; It automatically detects and reads from [[Human_interface_device|HID]] devices.

Alternative interfaces are available such as JMath,&lt;ref&gt;[http://robotics.caltech.edu/~radford/jmath/ JMath website]&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[GNU readline]] and MASH&lt;ref&gt;[http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/dreeves/mash/ MASH website]&lt;/ref&gt; which runs self contained Mathematica programs (with arguments) from the UNIX command line.

== Computable data ==
[[Image:MathematicaWind.png|thumb|325px|A stream plot of live weather data]]
Mathematica includes collections of curated data in a consistent framework for immediate computation. Data can be accessed programmatically to inform or test models and is updated automatically from a data server at Wolfram Research.&lt;ref&gt;http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/ScientificAndTechnicalData.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some data such as share prices and weather are delivered in real-time. Data sets currently include:
