'''Morelos''' ({{IPA-es|moËÉ¾elos}}) officially ''Estado Libre y Soberano de Morelos'' ({{lang-en|Free and Sovereign State of Morelos}}) is one of the 31 states which, with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided in [[Municipalities of Morelos|33 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Cuernavaca]]. 

It is located in [[South-Central Mexico]]. It is bordered by the states of [[State of Mexico|MÃ©xico]] to the north-east and north-west, [[Puebla]] to the east, [[Guerrero]] to the southwest and to the north with [[Mexico City]]. 

Morelos is the second-smallest state of the country just after [[Tlaxcala]]. It was part of the very large province then State of Mexico until 1869, when [[Benito JuÃ¡rez]] decree that its territory would be separated and named in honor of [[JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos y PavÃ³n]], who defended the city of [[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]] from royalist forces during the [[Mexican War of Independence]].  Most of the state is dominated by a warm climate year-round, which is good for the raising of [[sugar cane]] and other crops. It also has attracted visitors from the [[Valley of Mexico]] since [[Aztec]] times. Today, many people from Mexico City spend weekends in the state and own second homes, especially in the [[Cuernavaca]] area.

The state is also known for the [[Chinelos]], a type of costumed dancer, which appear at festivals, especially [[Carnival]], which is celebrated in a number of communities in the state. It is also home to [[TepoztlÃ¡n]], a âNew Ageâ town and a World Heritage Site, the [[Monasteries on the slopes of PopocatÃ©petl]].

==History==
===Pre-Hispanic period===
[[File:Xochicalcotempleofinscriptions.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Temple of the Feather Serpent Xochicalco]]
Evidence of the first human inhabitants in what is now Morelos dates back to 6000 BCE and shows these people as nomadic hunters and gatherers in the areas of [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]] and [[Chimalacatan]].&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The first agriculturally based settlements appear around 1500 BCE in [[TamoachÃ¡n]].&lt;ref name=&quot;morelos37&quot;&gt;Secretaria, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-morelos.gob.mx/index2.php?action=view&amp;art_id=475 |title=Nuestra Historia |publisher=Government of Morelos |location=Morelos |language=Spanish |trans_title=Our History |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early finds includes clay jars and figures in the Gaulupita neighborhood of Cuernavaca and three mounds in [[Santa MarÃ­a AhuacactitlÃ¡n]], which are probably the remains of houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;morelos37&quot;/&gt; 

The earliest identified culture is the [[Olmec]], which was dominant from 200 BCE to about 500 CE. Evidence of this culture is found in reliefs such as those found in the Cantera Mountain in [[Chalcatzingo]] and clay figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt; 

After the Olmec period, the area was invaded by several waves of migration from the Valley of Mexico in the north. The settlement of [[Mazatepec, Morelos|Mazatepec]] is founded in 603 by the [[Toltecs]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title= Historia |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de USA Estado de Morelos |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal  |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=History |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave Toltecs established the city state of [[Xochicalco]] (city of flowers). [[Teotihuacan]] influence is most evident at the temple of [[Quetzalcoatl]] but there are also signs of [[Maya peoples|Mayan]], [[Mixtec]] and [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt; The last wave of Toltecs arrived in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;  There are two groups from this wave. The first to arrive were the Xochimilcas, who settled in places such  as [[Tetela del VolcÃ¡n|Tetela]], [[Hueyapan]], TepoztlÃ¡n and [[Xumiltepec]]. Shortly afterwards the [[Matlatzinca|Tlahuicas]] arrived and has settled in an around CuauhnÃ¡huac or Cuernavaca by 1250.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt; There is evidence that indicates the Tlauhuicas probably would have been expelled from Morelos by the Xochimilcas if they had not been protected by [[Xolotl (Chichimec ruler)|XÃ³lotl]], lord of [[Acolhua]], who granted territory to Tochintecutli, the first lord of CuauhnÃ¡huac.&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The Tlahuicas are believed to be an offshoot of the Toltec-Chichimec group of [[Nahuatl]] speaking peoples who have occupied the area since the seventh century.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/morelos.html |author= John P. Schmal |title=Morelos:The Land of Zapata |work=History of Mexico |publisher=Houston Institute for Culture |location=Houston |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tlahuica eventually became the dominant ethnicity. They were organized into about fifty small city-states each with a hereditary ruler ([[tlatoani]]). Each Tlahuica city-state consisted of a 
central town, with its temple, plaza and palace and the surrounding countryside and villages. The largest where Cuernavaca and Huaxtepec (now spelled [[Oaxtepec]])  .&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1500-the-state-of-morelos-an-overview |title= The State Of Morelos â An Overview  |author=Julia Taylor |date= January 1, 2008  |publisher=MexConnect |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These people had advanced knowledge of astronomy and a highly developed agricultural system. 
They were especially known for growing cotton, which was planted wherever the land could be irrigated, with Tlahuica women spinning and weaving cloth. This cloth became a main means of exchange and of paying tribute.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;

The [[Mexica]] or Aztec began to arrive in the area as early as 1398, but efforts to dominate this area began in the 1420s.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;  In the 1420s and 1430s, Cuernavaca and [[Jiutepec]] were conquered by [[Itzcoatl]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; In the middle of the century, other city states in Morelos made war on Aztec held Cuernavaca and the Aztecs used this as an excuse to conquer areas such as Yautepec, [[Tetlama]] and other locations, eventually dominating the entire state. The inclusion of the area into the [[Aztec Empire]] was sealed with marriage of Aztec emperor [[Huitzilihuitl]] to Miahuaxochitl, daughter of the lord of Cuernavaca. This union produced a son who would become Aztec emperor [[Moctezuma Ilhuicamina]].  These conquered areas were allowed to keep their local political structures as long as tribute was regularly paid. This tribute mostly consisted of cotton items.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 48â49&lt;/ref&gt; The territory was divided into two tributary provinces, one centered on Cuernavaca and the other centered on Oaxtepec.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt; 

Moctezuma Ilhuicamina succeeded IzcÃ³atl, and tradition has it that he established a botanical garden in Oaxtepec, as well as vacationing in the warm springs located at the foothills of the Ajusco, located in what is now a resort run by the [[Mexican Social Security Institute|Social Security Administration (IMSS)]]. Another possible location for Moctezumaâs favorite swimming area is a nearby pond called âPoza Azulâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;morelos51&quot;&gt;Secretaria de EducaciÃ³n Publica. ''Chipmunks: MonografÃ­a estatal: 1982'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexica built a number of fortifications in the area, notably in the hills called El Sobrerito and Tlatoani near [[Tlayacapan]]; the pyramid of [[Tepozteco]] (TepoztlÃ¡n) may have also been designed as a fort and look-out post. The Tlauhuica built the double-pyramid known as [[Teopanzolco]] in Cuernavaca at this time also.&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 51â52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest and colonial period===
[[File:CapillaAbiertaCatCV.JPG|thumb|Open chapel of the current Cathedral of Cuernavaca]]
Population estimates for the beginning of the 16th century are: CuauhnÃ¡huac, 50,000; Oaxtepec, 50,000; Yautepec, 30,000; TepoztlÃ¡n, 20,000; [[Totolapan]], 20,000; and 12,000 each for Tlayacapan, Tetela, [[Yecapitxtla]], and [[Ocuituco]].&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish under [[HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s]] arrived into central Mexico. After CortÃ©s defeat in [[Tenochtitlan]] in 1520 ([[La Noche Triste]]) and retreat into [[Tlaxacala]], he sent expeditions to Morelos. One of the first Mexicas to accept Spanish authority was in Ocuituco. After the fall of Tenochtitlan, the Spanish returned to Morelos to subdue the Tlahuicas in Cuernavaca in 1521, led by [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]]. However, the first attempt failed. The next attempt first took Yautepec, Oaxtepec and Jiutepec and after a fierce fight, finally took the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; He constructed the [[Palace of Cortes, Cuernavaca|Palace of CortÃ©s]] in this city five years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

In 1529, CortÃ©s was named the Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca, which gave him control over 4,000&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² of territory in Morelos with Cuernavaca as the seat of authority over about eighty communities, eight haciendas and two sugar cane plantations. These lands stayed in the CortÃ©s family until 1809, when the government confiscated all of the lands of the Marquis.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;

Historian Ward Barrett considers that the Morelos region had a physical unity during the colonial period that was sufficient to define and set it apart in contrast to many other parts of Mexico. Much of this definition comes from its geography, which is a basin into which abundant water flows. The arrival of the Spanish shifted agricultural practices from cotton to sugar cane and the refining of such into sugar in nearby mills. Since this sugar competed with that grown in the [[Caribbean]] by slaves, the [[hacienda]] system was extremely powerful, reducing workers to serf status. This system would remain more or less intact until the [[Mexican Revolution]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;

===Independence to end of 19th century===
[[File:StatueMorelosParkCV.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Statue Morelos]]
The conditions on the sugar plantations of Morelos made [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Father Miguel Hidalgo]]âs call to take up arms well received by the indigenous and mestizo populations of the state. The first rebellions broke out in 1811, with some early successes.  An early insurgent leader in the state was Francisco Ayala. Insurgents from the state managed to push as far as [[Chalco de DÃ­az Covarrubias|Chalco]] in what is now Mexico State when royalist forces pushed them back in 1812.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt; After Hidalgo is executed, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos y Pavon takes over the insurgent effort, and [[Mariano Matamoros]] of [[Jantetelco]] joined this army in 1811.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

By 1812, insurgents had control of the city Cuautla and royalist forces began to put it under siege. Morelos and his men held out for 58 days when reinforcement arrived, breaking the siege. This was one of the early vital wins for the insurgent movement. Morelos would eventually be captured by royalist and executed in 1815, but the memory of this battle would lead to the future state being named after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;

After winning Independence, what is now the state of Morelos was the district of Cuernavaca as part of the very large State of Mexico, created in 1824. The entity would change status between state and department depending on whether liberal or conservative factions were in charge. In 1857, the State of Mexico and all other state would keep their federal status permanently under the constitution adopted that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;

Cuernavaca gained the title of city in 1834.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; During the Mexican-American War, this city was taken by the Americans under [[George Cadwalader|General Cadwalader]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;

The next conflict to play out in the state was the uprising against President [[Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna]] under the [[Plan of Ayutla]] in 1854. Armed rebellion broke out in Cuautla and Santa Anna responded by burning entire villages.  However, the rebellion dislodged Santa Anna, naming [[Juan Ãlvarez]] as the president. Alvarez moved the Mexican capital to Cuernavaca, with many foreign diplomatic missions moving to the city as well. A new constitution convention was called and when the [[1857 Constitution]] was proclaimed Alvarez retired and the capital moved back to Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 132â133&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution did not stop fighting among Conservative and Liberal factions in Mexico, which escalated again into the [[Reform War]] from 1858 to 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 133â136&lt;/ref&gt; Cuernavaca was a stronghold of the conservatives, while Cuautla was a liberal bastion. More than anything else, anarchy ruled, as bandits roamed the region, burned and destroyed the haciendas of PantitlÃ¡n and Xochimancas, and terrorized villagers. The war ended on January 11, 1861 when [[Benito JuÃ¡rez]] took control of Mexico City. [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]] wrote a novel, set in Yautepec, about the war and the bandits, called ''El Zarco: Episodios de la Vida Mexicana en 1861â63''.&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 136â138&lt;/ref&gt;

The division between the Liberal and Conservative parts of the state remain through the [[French Intervention in Mexico]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt; When the French army invaded Mexico, Francisco Leyva raised an army in Morelos to fight in the [[Battle of Puebla]] of May 5, 1862. Despite the heroic efforts on that day, the French eventually managed to gain control of the country and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor in 1864. Maximilian chose the Jardin Borda in Cuernavaca as his summer residence,&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 138â139&lt;/ref&gt; and he built âLa Casa del Olindoâ in Cuernavaca supposedly for Margarita Leguizmo Sedano, his mistress known as âLa India Bonitaâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;guia45&quot;&gt;Morelos GuÃ­a TurÃ­stica, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The French emperor improved the road from Mexico City to Cuernavaca and telegraphy service between the two began in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; However, resistance to French rule was well underway.  On January 1, 1867, republican troops under the leadership of Francisco Leyva, Ignacio Figueroa, and Ignacio Manuel Altamirano began an eight-day siege of Cuernavaca. Soon after that the French under [[Napoleon III]] withdrew its troops, and by July Maximilian was dethroned and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 139â140&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French were expelled by forces under Benito JuÃ¡rez, there were efforts to divide the State of Mexico. This resulted in the creation of the state of Morelos on 21 September 1868 by the federal Congress of Mexico. The territory of the state was the Third Military District of the State of Mexico as defined by the Juarez government. The name of Morelos and the capital Cuernavaca were selected by the stateâs first legislature. The first state constitution was finalized in 1870. There were boundary disputes between the new state with Mexico State and the Federal District, but these were resolved by the 1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;

A telegraph line from Mexico City-Cuernavaca had been laid between 1867 and 1869; in 1870 it was extended to [[Iguala]], [[Chilpancingo]], and [[Tixla]]. Another line, between Cuernavaca and Cuautla, was laid in 1875. Attempts were made to improve education, but limited funds made that virtually impossible.&lt;ref name=&quot;EducaciÃ³n Publica pp. 141-144&quot;&gt;Secretaria, pp. 141â144&lt;/ref&gt; Other infrastructure projects in the late 19th century included the [[Toluca]]-Cuernavaca highway, and a rail line between Mexico City and Cuautla. Rail lines would continue to be built through the late 19th century and into the 20th connecting the state further with Mexico City and to the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt; On May 11, 1874 the capital was moved to Cuautla; it was returned to Cuernavaca on January 1, 1876.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EducaciÃ³n Publica pp. 141-144&quot;/&gt;

The diocese of Cuernavaca was established in 1894 with Fortino HipÃ³lito Vera as the first bishop.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;

After Independence, the sugar industry continued and made Morelos one of the richest parts of Mexico. This was the main reason for the infrastructure projects during the latter 19th century as much of this sugar was being exported, mostly to Europe. However, the riches of the plantations were enjoyed only by often-absentee landowners, with workers in debt and poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt; During the presidency of [[Porfirio DÃ­az]] in the late 19th and very early 20th centuries, the larger plantations modernized used steam-driven mills and centrifugal extractors. This meant that those with the resources were able to demand more water and other resources and crowd out smaller competitors. It also resulted in an even wider gap between workers and owners. The prosperous landowners had much political clout under the Diaz regime as production increased fivefold. This allowed them to apply political pressure to obtain lands that had previously been held in communially among mestizos and indigenous groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt; Between 1884 and 1905, eighteen towns in Morelos disappeared as lands were taken by the haciendas.&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 152â158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican Revolution to present===
[[File:Emiliano Zapata5.jpg|thumb|Emiliano Zapata]]
Morelosâ sugar production, investment in infrastructure and laws favorable to business and foreign investment allowed it to participate in the world economy at the beginning of the 20th century and develop economically very rapidly. Some of the haciendas even evolved into company towns, employing between 250 and 3,000 workers with their own stores, powerhouses, schools and police.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;

However, the development of the haciendas came at the expense of the general populace which lost lands, water rights and even forced them to live on hacienda lands. The growth of the large haciendas, eventually concentrated the economy into 28 haciendas which occupied 77% of the stateâs territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;

This situation would make the state ripe for the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the base for one of the best known revolutionaries from this period: [[Emiliano Zapata]], who was born in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt; Some of the first outbreaks of violence took place in Cuernavaca under [[Genovevo de la O]] in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 168â170&lt;/ref&gt;  The state fell into the hands of Zapataâs [[Liberation Army of the South]] only one year after hostilities broke out in 1910. Government forces attacked towns and cities in the state, trying to take it back. It would remain solidly in Zapataâs hands unitil his death in 1919, despite challenges late in the war to forces loyal to fellow revolutionary [[Venustiano Carranza]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt; The Zapatistas imposed a heavy tax on haciendas; when the owners refused to pay, the rebels burned the cane fields such as those of Chinameca, Tenango, Treinta, Atilhuayan, Santa IÃ±es, and San Gabriel.&lt;ref&gt;Secretaria, pp. 179â180&lt;/ref&gt; Zapataâs remains are currently in Cuautla at the foot of a statue erected in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobhistoria&quot;/&gt;

Since the Revolution, the stateâs history has centered on development and crime. There were problems with highway and train bandits in the 1920s and 1930s, and the Buenavista-TepoztlÃ¡n highway was built in 1936. Highway construction eventually led to the closing of a number of rail lines including the Mexico City-Cuernavaca-Iguala line in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

As it has been since Aztec times, the state has been a favorite retreat for those in Mexico City, especially Cuernavaca, due to its warm year-round climate. This has been especially true since the latter 20th century and has spurred a major housing boom which continues to this day. Most of this boom is centered on the city of Cuernavaca but there it also affects Cuautla and some other places as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reprueban&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Reprueban crecimiento de Morelos |author=Raquel Fierro |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=May 2, 2006 |page=14 |language=Spanish  |trans_title= They reject growth in Morelos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the major crime problem was kidnapping for ransom. The kidnapping crime wave caused investment in the state to drop from a high of US $245million in 1999 to $102 million in 2002, with the state lagging the country in job creation. The state broke the kidnapping rings in the early 2000s, mostly by arresting corrupt lawyers, police and judges who were protecting kidnapping rings, includes one rund by Daniel âMocha Orejasâ Arizmendi, who received his nickname by cutting off his victimsâ ears and sending them to family members. The busts brought the kidnapping rate to below national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosestate&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Moody |year=October |month=2003 |title= Saving the rose state |journal=Business Mexico |volume=13 |issue=10 |page=26 |location=Mexico City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kidnapping problems, however, have been replaced with violence related to the drug trade, despite the fact that Morelos is far from the U.S. border. The 2009 slaying of kingpin [[Arturo BeltrÃ¡n Leyva]] set of a turf war for his successor. It has increased the number of gun battles and gangland-style executions. Anonymous email threats succeed in keeping people away from Cuernavaca at night, with bars and nightclubs closing when such communications threaten drug war violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ensnares&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Drug war ensnares Morelos |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/apr/20/world/la-fg-mexico-morelos-20100420 |newspaper=LA Times |location=Los Angeles |date= April 20, 2010  |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Governor Sergio Estrada ordered the mass firing of all of the state police officers after top police commanders were arrested on charges that they were working with drug traffickers.&lt;ref name=&quot;firesentire&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Governor of Morelos state fires entire police division |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location= Miami |date=April 14, 2004 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a major political battle for the governor, who then himself accused of cooperating with drug rings, with attempts to take him out of office.&lt;ref name=&quot;facescharges&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Governor of Morelos faces charges related to misuse of power and drug traffic |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location= Miami |date=October 25, 2004 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area around [[Lagunas de Zempoala National Park]], on Morelosâ border with Mexico City is one of Mexicoâs 16 most dangerous regions, in part due to the narcotics trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;restorepark&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Scientists want to restore national park in Mexico to avoid water loss |author=Claudia Ortega |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location= Miami |date=August 30, 2004 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state is considered to be one of the most dangerous, despite its small size and population. Most crime is centered in Cuernavaca. Its crime rate surpasses that of Mexico City in terms of crimes per 1000 people. It is over 50% higher than the national average. Although the city has only 21% of the population, it suffers 45% of the crime committed in the state. There are a number of possible causes. Some blame the judicial system for being inept and there are strong links to the drugtrafficking trade, bringing in merchandise to Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciudadcrimen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= La Ciudad y el Crimen / El Estado de Morelos |author=Rafael Ruiz Harrell |newspaper=Reforma |location= Mexico City |date=July 18, 2005 |page=8 |language=Spanish  |trans_title= The City in Crime/The state of Morelos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography, climate and nature==
[[File:Laguna de Zempoala.jpg|thumb|left|Laguna de Zempoala Park]]
The state is located in the center of the country and has a territory of 4,893&amp;nbsp;kmÂ², accounting for 0.25% of Mexicoâs total territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inegientidad&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.gob.mx/monografias/informacion/mor/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=17 |title= Informacion por entidad |publisher= [[INEGI]]  |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Information by entity |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second smallest state after Tlaxcala.&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;/&gt; It borders with the Federal District of Mexico City, the State of Mexico, Guerrero and Puebla.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title= Medio FÃ¬sico   |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico
Estado de Morelos |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal  |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Environment|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stateâs capital is Cuernavaca. It was the largest city of the Tlahuicas and originally called Cuauhnahuac, but the Spanish could not pronounce this and modified it to the current name. This city is only 90&amp;nbsp;km south of Mexico City and due to its gentle climate is referred to as âThe City of the Eternal Spring.â&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;/&gt;

Morelos, most of which is between 1,000 and 3,300 meters (2,900 â 9,800 feet) above sea level, has a very diverse topography: 42% mountainous, 16% hilly land, and 42% flat terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt; The highest altitudes are found near the stateâs border with Mexico City, and the lowest are found in the [[Huaxtla]] region.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; The state straddles two main geographic formations, the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] in the north and east and the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], which stretches south and west from Cuernavaca and Jiutepec.&lt;ref name=&quot;secturclima&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.morelostravel.com/sobremorelos.php |title= El Clima en Morelos  |publisher= Secretaria del Turismo de Morelos |location=Morelos |language=Spanish |trans_title=The weather in Morelos |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majestic mountain peaks of the [[Ajusco|Sierra Ajusco]] in the north of the state divide Morelos from the neighboring Valley of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;  

The state is in the highest part fo the [[Balsas River]] basin, which ends in the north in the areas bounded by the Sierra Ajusco-Chichinautzin and the [[PopocatÃ©petl]] volcano. From this point south, the state gradually slopes downward, interrupted by the Tlaltizapan and Yautepec mountains in the center of the state and the Huautla mountains in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;secturclima&quot;/&gt; There are no major rivers here but a large number of small rivers and streams which all eventually feed into the Balsas River.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The climate and vegetation varies from alpine meadows in the highest elevations near Popocatepetl to lowland rainforest in the south. Roughly 70% of the state has a humid and relatively warm climate, especially in the highly populated areas of Cuernavaca, TepotzlÃ¡n, Oaxtepec and Yautepec. Average temperature is approximately 25Â°C (77Â°F) year round, with a rainy season from May until September.&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;secturclima&quot;/&gt;

The climates can be further subdivided into hot and semihumid, semi hot and semi humid, temperate and semi humid, semi cold and semi humid and cold. The hot and semi humid climate covers about 78% of the stateâs territory, with an average temperature of 22C, with rains in the summer. This area presents mostly subtropical rainforest type vegetation.The semi hot and semi humid climate can be found in a strip in the north of the state and accounts for 13% of the territory. Average temperature varies between 18 and 22C with rains in the summer and a dry season in the winter. A temperate and semi humid climate covers about 10% of the territory and found in the north of the state around the municipalities of [[Huitzilac, Morelos|Huitzilac]], [[Tlanepantla, Morelos|Tlanepantla]], [[Totolapan]], [[Tetela del VolcÃ¡n]] and parts of Cuernavaca, Tepoztlan, Ocuituco, Tlayacapan and [[MiacatlÃ¡n]]. This area has an average temperature of between 10 and 15C, with mixed forests of pine and [[holm oak]]. A semi cold and semi humid climate accounts for only 2% of the territory and found along the borders of the Federal District, Mexico State and Puebla. This area has pine forests and some [[alpine meadow]]s. The coldest climate is found in the upper parts of Popocatepetl that belong to the state. Average temperature here is less than 5C with frequent freezes. Most of the vegetation is alpine meadow or moss.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The natural resources of the state have been taken advantage of for centuries and have suffered changes as a consequence, especially in landscapes, water sources, flora and fauna. This change accelerates as the population grows.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; The state has one major national park called the [[Lagunas de Zempoala National Park|Lagunas de Zempoala]]. It is one of Mexicoâs largest national parks, located on the southern flank of the Sierra Madre mountains. The park had five mountain-fed lakes and abundant wildlife when the park was established in 1937.This park is being stressed due to illegal logging with subsequent soil erosion and water from its last dark blue lake to drainage. Much of this drainage is to provide water to Cuernavaca, whose population uses 785 liters of water per day per person, twice that of Mexico City. The parkâs area has shrunk from {{convert|55000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} to 12,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;restorepark&quot;/&gt;

Much of the stateâs ecological woes stem from the housing explosion, which is mostly centered in the capital of Cuernavaca, but it is a problem in places such as Cuautla as well.Groups such as the Frente de Pueblos en Defensa de la Tierra y el Agua and Guardianes de los Ãrboles have criticized the government for allowing city areas to grow with insufficient planning and control. They also claim that it is hurting much of the stateâs ecosystem and water supply.&lt;ref name=&quot;reprueban&quot;/&gt;

==Demographics==
Morelos is the second smallest state and ranks 24 out of 31 states in population, with 1.6% of Mexicoâs total population. However, it is ranked third in population density after Mexico City and the State of Mexico. 86% of the population lives in urban areas with only 14% in rural areas. Nationally, the figures are 76% and 24%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ineginumero&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.gob.mx/monografias/informacion/mor/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=17 |title= Numero de habitantes  |publisher= [[INEGI]]  |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Number of inhabitants |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;  Just under 60% of the stateâs population lives in seven municipalities, which are Cuernavaca, Jiutepec, Temixco, Cuautla, Yautepec, Jojutla and Ayala. The most heavily populated area of the state is the city of Cuernavaca and its metropolitan area with 21.95% of the total. It is followed by the urban area of Cuautla-Yautepec-Ayala with just under 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

The state has had a higher than average population increase since the mid 1990s at about 4%. In some areas, population growth has been very high at points, such ais in Jiutepec at over 21% and Emiliano Zapata with over 15%. Much of this growth has been in the main cities of Cuernavaca, Cuautla, Ayala and Yautepec. This growth has meant the loss of Morelosâ ability to feed itself, with less than 40% of grains consumed grown inside the state. Population growth has also put strain on infrastructure such as water, sewer, potable water, electricity, roads and schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

The Catholic religion dominates but there are significant minorities of evangelical Protestants and those of the Jewish faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

The indigenous population of the state is estimated at 8%, just under the national average of 10%.(perfilsoc) However, only 2% of the population is counted as speaking an indigenous language compared to seven nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;inegientidad&quot;/&gt; The total counted in 2005 by INEGI was 24,757.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;
Historically, various [[Nahua peoples]] have dominated the state. This population severely diminished during the colonial period and again during the Porfiriato (late 19th and early 20th century), when many indigenous peasants were sent to other parts of the country to work. Those considered to be ethnically indigenous are located in 33 municipalities with most concentrated in 15 of these. Many identify as Mixtec, [[Tlapaneco]] and Zapotec who have immigrated from Puebla, Guerrero and Oaxaca. Most of those who identify as Nahua are native to the state. Many of the immigrant indigenous are migrant workers, traveling among fields of sugar cane, corn, tomatoes and onions. Some return to their home states in the off-season and some remain permanently in Morelos.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

While indigenous languages have almost completely disappeared since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], many old customs and traditions continue to live on as part of many peopleâs identity. Many ethnic Nahuas conserve much of their ancient knowledge, such as dances, music agricultural practices and rituals although most a mixed with Catholic and moderns beliefs and practices. Since Mexicoâs census only counts those who speak an indigenous language and not by ethnicity, it is not possible to be sure the precise number of Morelosâ Nahua population. Between 32 and 35 communities in the state have been identified as being âindigenousâ based on prevailing customs and tradition. However, this does not take into account migrant workers or who have immigrated to the state from other parts of Mexico. In 2000, 30,896 people were counted as speaking an indigenous language, with the municipalities of Cuautla, Cuernavaca, Ayala, Puente de Ixtla, Temixco and Tetela del VolcÃ n having the highest number of speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

Of the eleven municipalities which are classified as highly marginalized economically, only three have a significant indigenous population, which are Temoac, MiacatlÃ¡n and Tetela del VolcÃ¡n. However, in larger municipalities such as Cuernavaca and Jiutepec, indigenous communities here tend to be highly marginalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

==Government==
[[File:PalGobiernoCV.JPG|thumb|State Government Palace in Cuernavaca]]
The state is governed by an elected governor, who has a cabinet with four departments called âPolicy, Security and Justice,â âHuman and Social Development,â âSustainable Economic Developmentâ and âDevelopment and Modernization of the Administration.â .&lt;ref name=&quot;ejecutivo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.morelos.gob.mx/index2.php?action=view&amp;art_id=483 |title= Poder Ejecutivo |publisher=Government of Morelos |location=Morelos |language=Spanish |trans_title=Exectutive power |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state Congress in is charge of passing laws and revising those already in existence. It is unicameral with thirty âdeputiesâ (diputados) representing various portions of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;congreso&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.congresomorelos.gob.mx/congreso.php?section=ElCongreso |title= Que es el Congreso?  |publisher=Congress of Morelos |location=Morelos |language=Spanish |trans_title=What is the Congress? |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morelos is subdivided into [[Municipalities of Morelos|33 ''municipios'']] ([[Municipality|municipalities]]).

Aside from the state capital of [[Cuernavaca]], nicknamed ''La Ciudad de la Eterna Primavera'' (The City of Eternal Spring), other major communities include:
*[[Cuautla, Morelos|Cuautla]]
*[[Emiliano Zapata, Morelos|Emiliano Zapata]]
*[[Jiutepec]]
*[[Temixco]]
*[[Yautepec de Zaragoza]]
* [[Jojutla]]

==Economy and tourism==
[[File:Sembradios de tlatenchi.jpg|thumb|Field in Jojutla]]
Morelosâ economy is based on agriculture, tourism and urbanization. Since the 1960s, the economy has been shifting from agriculture to industry and commerce although few of these are on a large scale. However, there are still a number of municipalities which are still almost completely reliant on agriculture.While the state provides just 1.6% of the countryâs GDP, its economy is strong enough to attract workers, especially farm workers from other areas of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title= Perfil SociodemogrÃ¡fico   |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico

Estado de Morelos |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal  |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Economic Activity |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a large percentage of the stateâs population works six days a week, receiving wages of only 500 to 700 Mexican pesos ($46â$65USD), despite the fact that Morelos is one of the more expensive states to live in.&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;/&gt;

Economically, the state divides into seven districts. The Cuernavaca Region includes the municipalities of Cuernavaca, [[Temixco, Morelos|Temixco]], [[Emiliano Zapata, Morelos|Emiliano Zapata]], [[Jiutepec]] and [[Xochitepec]]. The Norte Region includes the municipalities of Huitzilac, TepoztlÃ¡n, Tlalnepantla and Totolapan. The Cuautla Region includes the municipalities of [[Atlatlahucan]], [[Ayala, Morelos|Ayala]], Cuautla, Tlayacapan, Yautepec and Yecapixtla. The Noreste Region includes Ocuituco, [[Temoac]], Tetela del VolcÃ¡n and [[Zacualpan de Amilpas]]. The Sureste Region includes [[Axochiapan]], [[Jantetelco]], [[Jonacatepec]] and [[Tepalcingo]]. The Sur Region includes [[Amacuzac, Morelos|Amacuzac]], [[Jojutla]], [[Puente de Ixtla]], [[TlaltizapÃ¡n]], [[Tlaquiltenango]] and [[Zacatepec de Hidalgo]] and the Poniente Region includes [[CoatlÃ¡n del RÃ­o]], [[Mazatepec, Morelos|Mazatepec]], [[MiacatlÃ¡n]] and [[Tetecala, Morelos|Tetecala]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;regionalizacion&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title= RegionalizaciÃ³n       |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico

In 2003, it was one of the first states to take advantage of a new law allowing states to sell bonds.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosestate&quot;/&gt; In 2002, the state sold $24 million USD worth of bonds on the Mexican stock market, to finance highways, schools, waterworks and other infrastructure projects. The bond sales also allow the state to have access to lower-interest long-term financing.&lt;ref name=&quot;fiscaltools&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= New Fiscal Tools Help Mexico Gain Economic Sophistication |author=Brendan M. Case |newspaper=Knight Ridder Tribune Business News |location= Washington |date=April 11, 2002 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its location near Mexico City, the state has one of the lower rates of economic marginalization, ranking 20th of 33 units in economic marginialzation, based on housing and education. The most urbanized areas of the state are the economically best off, with the least urbanized being the poorest. Two of the factors in the development of the stateâs economy since the 1960s is the opening of the Mexico City-[[Acapulco]] highway through the state in 1952 and the creation of the CIVAC (Ciudad Industrial Valle de Cuernavaca) industrial complex in 1965. This concentrated the population growth into the northern part of the state. Only eleven of the states 33 municicpalities are considered to have any serious degree of marginalization: Tlalnepantla, Totolapan, Tlayacapan, Tetela del VolcÃ¡n, Ocuituco, Zaculapan, Temoac, Tepalcingo, Amacuzac, CoatlÃ¡n del RÃ­o, MiacatlÃ¡n and some parts of Puente de Ixtla.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:CucumberFieldTlaya.JPG|thumb|left|Cucumber field in Tlayacapan]]
Since the 1980s, the agricultural sector of the economy has been steadily shrinking but it remains an important part of the stateâs economy, as there are still a significant number of communities that rely on it.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; Just under 20% of the working population of the state is involved in farming, ranching, fish farming or forestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; Land available for human exploitation outside of populated areas is divided between agriculture/grazing (45%) and forestry (55%).&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Agricultural and forestry lands are further subdivided by climate and the type of forest (conifer vs. rainforest). Roughly 70% of the state has a subtropical climate, providing ideal conditions for agriculture, in particular sugar cane, and most farming is done in the warmer areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; Sugar cane has been an important crop since colonial times and still is important today, although the percentage of land dedicated to it has decreased since the 1960s. Another important crop is rice, which is also diminishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; The production of rice in the state has fallen drastically, from a height of 100,000 tons annually to only 21,000 tons due to the reduction in cultivation areas and the high costs of production. The state still ranks sixth in its production. However, despite Price and market protections, foreign rice is competing with Mexican grown rice including rice produced in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;arrozcae&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Produccion de arroz cae a 21 mil toneladas anuales en zona de Morelos |author=Carlos Velasco |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location= Miami |date=December 20, 2004 |page=1 |language=Spanish  |trans_title= Rice production falls to 21,000 tones annually in the Morelos area}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorghum has replaced lost yields of sugar cane and rice to a certain extent, which has been encouraged by the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; One way the state tries to sell its more expensive products such as rice has been the registration of a trademark called âTradicion Agricola de Morelosâ (Morelos Agricultural Tradition) to identify products produced in the state on store shelves.&lt;ref name=&quot;arrozcae&quot;/&gt;

Another important cash and export crop is fresh flowers and ornamental plants. In 2003, this sector accounted for 27 million dollars of income to the state, up from 20 million in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arrozcae&quot;/&gt;  Morelos is Mexicoâs major producers of roses, producing 54,552 dozens in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosestate&quot;/&gt; Morelos claims to be the native location of the [[poinsettia]], called ânoche buenaâ in Spanish. It is native to Mexico, but there has been a âdiplomatic patentâ on the plant since the early 19th century when the first US ambassador to Mexico, Joel Roberts Poinsett, registered it. The stateâs historical society has ased the Secretary of the Interior to review treaties and work to have this patent annulled. As it stands now, Mexican poinsettia growers must pay royalty fees to the U.S. and even import cuttings from authorized growers in the U.S. to grow the plant commercially. Another effort to combat the patent is to develop a new variety of the flower that would not be covered.&lt;ref name=&quot;jmiranda&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican authorities looking to produce variant of flower native to Morelos state; [Source: El Universal] |author=Justino Miranda  |newspaper=NoticiasFinancieras |location= Miami |date=December 20, 2004 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetables and fruits, along with corn and beans grown for subsistence are widely grown. These include bananas, [[cherimoya]]s, [[mamey]]s, melons, cucumbers, [[tomatillo]]s, [[jicama]], squash, [[alfalfa]], cotton, peanuts, onions and tomatoes.&lt;ref name=&quot;schmal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; Many crops are grown for auto consumption, especially in indigenous areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; The state is working to help shift agriculture production from the traditional corn and beans, which can be imported cheaper, to other products such as apricots, which have been shown to make money.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosestate&quot;/&gt; Livestock mostly consists of cattle, pigs, horses and domestic fowl. There is some fish farming in the state, mostly of [[mojarra]] and [[tilapia]] in Rodeo and Zacatepec.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt;

Industry, mining and construction accounts for 29% of the stateâs GDP and employs 27% of the working population.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; One important industry is food processing, especially sugar came, rice, [[sorghum]], grains, flowers and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; 

Goods produced include autos and auto parts, textiles, pharmaceuticals, metal products, agro-industry, ceramics and handcrafted items. Most exports go to the United States, Canada, Japan and the [[European Union]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; In the early 2000s, the state attracted a number of foreign enterprises to build industrial facilities here, includes car parts such as windshields.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosestate&quot;/&gt;

The Desarrollo Industrial Emiliano Zapata is the newest park, located just outside of Cuernavaca in the municipality of Emiliano Zapata. It has an extension of 23.5 hectares. One of its principal occupants if the NUSTART clothing manufacturer. Another is the Emiliano Zapata Central de Abastos (wholesale food market) .&lt;ref name=&quot;portalmorelos&quot;/&gt;

Commerce, transportation, services and tourism accounts for 59% of the stateâs GDP and employs just over 50% of the working population.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt; The growth of the commerce sector is due to urbanization and the growth of tourism.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; The biggest selling point of the state touristically is its location, just south of Mexico City, which has the largest and wealthiest population in the country. Most of these come to the state for its water parks, spas, or to spend weekend in Cuernavacaâs nightclubs, and away from Mexico Cityâs traffic and pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;rosestate&quot;/&gt; Many of these visitors have bought second homes here, which has driven property prices up.&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;/&gt; Those from Mexico City and other cities are also attracted to the states water parks and spas, such as Las Palmas in Tehuixtla, El Rollo in  and the Parque Acuatico Oaxtepec.&lt;ref name=&quot;actecon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;informorelos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.infomorelos.com/turismo/balnearios.html |title= Balnearios en el Estado de Morelos, Parques AcuÃ¡ticos |publisher=Info Morelos |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Spas and Water parks in the State of Morelos |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state, especially around the capital of Cuernavaca, has experienced a housing boom since the late 1990s. More than 10,000 houses were built from 2000 to 2008 and another 50,000 are planned through 2013. The stateâs office of urban development states that this is far above what is needed to house the stateâs population. Instead, it reflects demand from Mexico City for weekend and getaway homes. The housing boom has put strain on infrastructure and on property prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;crecimiento&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Sufren en Morelos crecimiento caÃ³tico |author=RaÃºl GonzÃ¡lez |newspaper=El Norte |location= Monterrey, Mexico |date=June 23, 2008 |page=17 |language=Spanish  |trans_title= Morelos suffers chaotic growth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agua Hedionda.jpg|thumb|View of Agua Hedionda]]
Cuautla is the second largest city in the state and was the site of one of the early major battle of the Mexican War of Independence. The center of the town is home to the Municipal Palace and the Santo Domingo Church. One major attraction is the Morelos House, where JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos y Pavon lived. Near the city are various spas and waters parks such as the Agua Hedionda, famous for its foul-smelling sulfur laden waters.&lt;ref&gt;Romo, pp. 61â62&lt;/ref&gt; The original town of is now located under Lake Tequesquitengo, which was created when the area was flooded by damming the local river.

The state has a number of archeological sites, the largest and most important of which is Xochicalco. It was founded by Mayan traders known as the Olmeca-Xicallanca, later inhabited by the Tlahuica and has been designated as a World Heritage Site.&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inah&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/ZonasArqueologicas/xochicalco/indice.htm |title= Zona ArqueolÃ³gica de Xochicalco |publisher=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Xochicalco Archeological Zone |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its best known structure is the Temple of [[Quetzalcoatl]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;inah&quot;/&gt; The site of [[Teopanzolco]] is located within the city of Cuernavaca.

[[File:Tlayacapan i01.jpg|thumb|left|Monastery of San Juan Bautista in Tlayacapan]]
The [[Monasteries on the slopes of PopocatÃ©petl]] is a World Heritage Site that consists of fourteen monasteries that are located south and east of [[Mexico City]], most in the state of Morelos with three in the state of Puebla.  The monasteries in Morelos are located in the municipalities of [[Atlatlahucan]], [[Cuernavaca]], [[Tetela del VolcÃ¡n]], [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]], [[Ocuituco]], [[TepoztlÃ¡n]], [[Tlayacapan]], [[Totolapan]], [[Yecapixtla]] and [[Zacualpan de Amilpas]]. The three in Puebla are located in [[Calpan (municipality)|Calpan]], [[Huejotzingo (municipality)|Huejotzingo]] and [[Tochimilco (municipality)|Tochimilco]] .

==Culture==
Culturally, the state divides into four sections called Zona Norte, Zona Oriente, Zona Sur Oeste and Zona Centro. Zona Norte is linked to the Valley of Mexico and includes the municipalities of Cuernavaca, TepoztlÃ¡n, Tlalnepantla, Totolapan, Atlatlahucan, Yecapixtla, Ocuituco and Tetela del VolcÃ¡n. Zona Oriente is linked to Puebla and includes the municipalities of Zacualpan de Amilpas, Jantetelco, Jonacatepec and Axochiapan. Zona Sur Oeste includes the municipalities of Tlaquiltenango, Jojutla, Zacatepec, Puente de Ixtla, Amacuzac, CoatlÃ¡n del RÃ­o, Tetecala, Mazatepec and MiacatlÃ¡n. Zona Centro includes the municipalities of Temixco, Yautepec, Jiutepec, Emiliano Zapata, [[Ciudad Ayala, Morelos|Ayala]], Tlaltizapan and Axochiapan.&lt;ref name=&quot;regionalizacion&quot;/&gt;

===Music===
Most of the state's traditional music is associated with [[corridos]] and a band named Banda Tlayacapan. The corrido is sung and played in many parts of Mexico. Those performed in Morelos belong to the &quot;suriano&quot; (southern) type, which can be complicated but unlike the northern version, in not meant to be danced to. The lyrics of this type of corrido generally has eight syllables per line forming stanzas of five verses each. This type of corrido dates back as far as before the Mexican Revolution, but the tradition has waned. One band noted for saving traditional melodies and songs is the Banda Tlayacapan, based in [[Tlayacapan]] in the north of the state. This band was formed in 1870 and is the state's oldest band organization. Originally it was begun by Vidal SantamarÃ­a and at first consisted of family members playing simple wind instruments. Over time, the organization grew, surviving the Mexican Revolution and the siege of the area by the [[Liberation Army of the South]]. Today, the band is still led by the SantamarÃ­a family and has performed in the United States and Europe. It is noted not only for its longevity but also for its ability to rescue and preserve a large number of traditional music from Morelos and central Mexico. In popular music, the best known composer from the state is [[Arturo MÃ¡rquez]], who was born in [[Ãlamos, Sonora]], but has lived in Cueravaca for a long time. He is known for his [[danzÃ³n|danzones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1920&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 19â20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music, dance and Carnival===
[[File:Chinelos de Morelos.JPG|thumb|Chinelos]]
One tradition that is identified with the state of Morelos is the Dance of the [[Chinelos]].The dance is popular on many occasions but especially during Carnival in which it originated.&lt;ref name=&quot;brinco&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-brinco-del-chinelo-morelos.html  |title= El brinco del chinelo (Morelos)  |month=February |year=2000 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans_title=The Chinelo Dance (Morelos) |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the dance or tradition is not known.  One story dates the origin to 1870, when a group of youths decided to dress in old clothes, covering their faces in cloth to shout and jump around in the streets. Other stories put the origin much farther in the past during the colonial past, either as a syncretism between Spanish and indigenous dances, or as a protest or mockery of the indigenousâ Spanish overlords. However, it has clearly been identified as originating in Tlayacapan and since then has spread to various parts of Morelos state, parts of Puebla and the Federal District of Mexico City.&lt;ref name=&quot;pormorelos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brinco&quot;/&gt;

Today, the Chinelo is considered to be a symbol of the identity of the state. Although Chinelos are most frequently found in TepoztlÃ¡n, Chinelos groups exist many communities such as Yautepec, Oacalco, Cualtlixco, AtlahuahuacÃ n, Oaxtepec, Jojutla and Totolapan. They can also be found in certain parts of Puebla. The Chinelos dance in groups near each other. Each dancer has his/her own style, which s/he has been developing since childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;pormorelos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brinco&quot;/&gt; 

Although not as well known as the Carnival of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], a number of communities in the state hold Carnival celebrations in the days leading up to [[Ash Wednesday]]. These include Jiutepec, TlaltizapÃ¡n, Emiliano Zapata, TepoztlÃ¡n, Tlayacapan, Yautepec, and Xochitepec. What distinguishes carnivals in Morelos from others in Mexico is the participation of the Chinelos and bands with wind instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnavales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.morelosturistico.com/espanol/pagina/z_362_Calendario_de_Carnavales_en_Morelos.php |title= Calendario de Carnavales en Morelos. |publisher=Secretary of Tourism of Morelos |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Calendar of Carnivals in Morelos |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tepotzlan on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday, the traditional [[tianguis]] market is cleared away from the main square and hundreds of multicolored stands move onto the streets in order to a make way for Carnival. The street stands mostly specialized in items needed to enjoy the event. Chinelo dancers dominate the event, many in costumes which have been very expensive to assemble. Other events during Carnival here are processions, including one very large and principle one in which there are representatives of all the communities of the municipality. The events last from Sunday to midnight Tuesday, signaling the beginning Ash Wednesday and [[Lent]] and each day the Chinelos dance more energetically than the last.&lt;ref name=&quot;brinco&quot;/&gt;

===Art, literature and architecture===
Most of the state's art scene dates from the 20th century. After the Mexican Revolution, and partly because of state's role in it, a number of muralists came to the state and painted works with social themes in places such as the Palacio de CortÃ©s and the Museo de la Tallera Siqueiros. Because of the state's mild climate and Cuernavaca's cultural tradition, many Mexican and foreign artists and writers have made the state home. Joy Laville is from Wright, England and resides in Cuernavaca. She is known for her landscapes which often include nude humans. Some of her works include Mujer viendo una casa, Mujer en perfil adn Mujer con flores. Jorge CÃ¡zares Campos is a native of the state who is a self-taught painter, mostly of Mexican landscapes. Rafael Cauduro was born in Mexico City and his artwork has brought him fame not only in Morelos but internationally as well. Magali Lara is also originally from Mexico City and has had shows in various countries. Morelos native Carlos Campos Campus is known for his sculpture with pre-Hispanic influence. Writers include Malcom Lowry, an Englishman who wrote &quot;Bajo del VolcÃ¡n&quot; in the first half of the 20th century. It is set in Cuernavaca and made the city internationally famous. Elena Garro is an important Mexican writer originally from Puebla, but who lived most of her life in Cuernavaca. She is known for works such as Los recuerdos del porvenir, El Ãrbol and Andarse por las ramas. Another Mexican transplant to Cuernavaca is Franciso Hinojosa, one of the best known author of childrenÂ´s literature in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1417&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 14â17&lt;/ref&gt;

Major architectural works in the state date from the pre-Hispanic period to the 19th century. The most important pre-Hispanic structure are found at the [[Xochicalo]] and [[Teopanzolco]] archeological sites. The first is a city that was built on top of a large hill, with the Temple of [[Queztalcoatl]] as its center. This temple is really a pyramid with significant [[Toltec]] influence with four columns in the center. Teopanzolco has a pyramid with twin temples, as it was built by the [[Aztec]]s after they conquered the area. After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], major constructions here were Christian instead of the native pagan. In the first half of the 16th century, a series of fortress-like church and monastery complexes were built around the slopes of the [[PopocatÃ©pel]] volcano from Cuernavaca to [[Tetela del VolcÃ¡n]], and on into Puebla state, all related to early evangelization efforts. Today, these monasteries are no longer used as such although most of the church associated with them remain active, and are now a [[Monasteries on the slopes of PopocatÃ©petl|World Heritage Site]]. Non-ecclesiastical building from the colonial and Independence periods were mostly confined to the capital of Cuernavaca and include the Palacio de CortÃ©s, the Borda Gardens and the Morelos and Ocampo Theaters. Much of the rest of the state was divided into large haciendas, many dedicated to sugar productions, with large senorial mansions for their owners. Some of these include Hacienda de Chiconcuac, Hacienda de San Gaspar and Hacienda de Ixtoluca. One notable 20th century structure was the Japananese style house built by Woolworths heiress Barbara Hutton just outside of the city of Cuernavaca.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1213&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 12â13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:PestalozziSchoolCV.JPG|thumb|Pestalozzi School in Cuernavaca]]
The state, especially in the Cuernavaca area, is known as a center of education, second to Mexico City. The state has a high percentaged of education and well-traveled people, who speak second languages such as English, French and German.&lt;ref name=&quot;jtaylor&quot;/&gt;

Modern education in the state began during the [[Reform War|Reform period]], with the Mexican government taking over educational responsibilities from the church. The governmentâs role in education expanded after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In Morelos, the government founded âCasas del Puebloâ (Peopleâs Houses) staffed with a teacher for the community to become a central figure. In 1936, the Escuela Regional Campesina (Farm Workersâ Regional School) was established in Yautepec and a short time after that President [[LÃ¡zaro CÃ¡rdenas]] founded the Escuela Normal Feminina de Palmira (Palmira Teachers College for Women) and the Instituto Federal de Capacitacion del Magisterio for those to earn or complete their teaching credentials.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

Until 1991, education was rigidly centralized and bureaucratic, causing difficulties in providing adequate education to many areas. In 1992, the Instituto de la EducaciÃ³n BÃ¡sica (Basic Education Institute) was created to change this. This divided basic education into pre-school, special education, primary and secondary and provided guarantees for a minimum.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt;

Today over 360,000 students are taught by over 13,000 teachers in 823 schools up to the eighth grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;perfilsoc&quot;/&gt; All municipalities are required by state law to provide preschool, and grade school education to their populations up to the eighth grade, as well as professional development for teachers. All are required to attend school up to the eighth grade.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/morelos/ |title= Infraestructura     |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico
Estado de Morelos |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal  |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Infrastructure |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most schoolchildren begin with at least one year of preschool or kindergarten and secondary school (middle school) is provided either through face-to-face classes or through âtelesecundariasâ with televised classes in the more rural areas. Secondary schools are also divided into general and technical schools.

The origins of the [[Universidad AutÃ³noma del Estado de Morelos]] or UAEM date back to the 19th century when governor Francisco Leyva founded the Instituto Literario y Cientifico de Morelos in 1871. It was mostly suspended shortly thereafter by President Porfirio Diaz, a political opponent of Leyva, leaving only the School of Agriculture and Veterinary Studies in Acapantzingo. It was revived under the name of Instituto de Estudios Superiores del Estado de Morelos by Governor Elpidio Perdomo and President LÃ¡zaro CÃ¡rdenas. It was reorganized under its current name in 1953, after the additions of more fields of study.&lt;ref name=&quot;UAEMhis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uaem.mx/historia/|title= Historia de la UAEM  |publisher= Universidad AutÃ³noma del Estado de Morelos |location=Morelos |language=Spanish |trans_title=History of UAEM |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the school  offers forty bachelorâs degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;licenciaturas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uaem.edu.mx/licenciaturas/ |title= Licenciaturas      |publisher= Universidad AutÃ³noma del Estado de Morelos |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Bachelorâs degrees |accessdate=September 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
