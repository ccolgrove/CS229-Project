'''Walter Krueger''' (26 January 1881 &amp;ndash; 20 August 1967) was an American soldier of German descent and [[General officer|General]] in the first half of the 20th century. He is best known for his command of the [[Sixth United States Army]] in the [[South West Pacific Area]] during [[World War II]].  He was the first soldier to rise from the rank of Private to General in the United States Army.

==Education and early life==
Walter Krueger was born in [[ZÅotÃ³w|Flatow]], [[Province of West Prussia|West Prussia]] ([[German Empire]]) (since 1945 ZÅotÃ³w, Poland), the son of Julius KrÃ¼ger, a [[Prussia]]n landowner who had served as an officer in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and his wife, Anna, formerly Hasse.  Following Julius's death, Anna and her three children emigrated to the United States to be near her uncle in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Walter was then eight years old. After Anna remarried, the family settled in [[Madison, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Holzimmer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Holzimmer |first = Kevin C. |title = General Walter Krueger: Unsung Hero of the Pacific War |publisher = [[University Press of Kansas]] |year = 2007 |location = [[Lawrence, Kansas]] |pages = 10 |isbn= 978-0-7006-1500-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early military service==
On 17 June 1898, Krueger, along with many of his fellow high-school students, enlisted for service in the [[Spanish-American War]] with the 2nd Volunteer Infantry. He reached [[Santiago de Cuba]] a few weeks after the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]]. Mustered out of the volunteers in February 1899, he returned home to [[Ohio]] planning to be a civil engineer.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title = Old Soldier |newspaper = TIME |date = 29 January 1945 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,933961,00.html |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of his comrades were re-enlisting for service in the [[Philippine-American War]] and in June 1899 Krueger re-enlisted as a private in M Company of the [[12th Infantry Regiment (United States)|12th Infantry]]. Soon he was on his way to fight [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]'s ''Insurrectos'' as part of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]]'s 2nd Infantry Division. He took part in the advance from [[Angeles City]] to [[Tarlac City]], Aguinaldo's capital. But Aguinaldo had fled, and the 12th Infantry pursued him vainly all the way through Luzon's central plain to [[Dagupan City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME&quot;/&gt; 

While serving in an infantry unit in the [[Philippines]], he was promoted to sergeant. On July 1, 1901, he was commissioned a [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] and posted to the [[30th Infantry Regiment (United States)|30th Infantry]] on [[Marinduque]].&lt;ref&gt;Holzimmer, ''Krueger'', pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; 

Krueger returned to the United States with the 30th Infantry in December 1903. In September 1904, he married Grace Aileen Norvell, whom he had met in the Philippines. They had three children: James Norvell (July 29, 1905-December, 1964), Walter Jr (April 25, 1910-February 15, 1997) and Dorothy Jane, born on January 24, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Holzimmer, ''Krueger'', pp. 16, 18, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Both James and Walter Jr attended the [[United States Military Academy]], James graduating with the class of 1926 and Walter Jr. with the class of 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME&quot;/&gt; Dorothy married an Army officer, Aubrey D. Smith.

In 1904, Krueger attended and graduated from the Infantry-Cavalry School at [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas]], followed by the [[Command and General Staff College|General Staff College]] in 1907. After a second tour in the Philippines, he was assigned to Department of Languages at Fort Leavenworth as an instructor in Spanish and German, which he could speak fluently, along with French and English. Not only was Krueger an expert on discipline and training, he was also a noted military historian and scholar of military affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Holzimmer, ''Krueger'', pp. 18-22&lt;/ref&gt; He published translations of several German military texts, most notably William Balck's ''Tactics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Balck  |first = William |title = Tactics |publisher = Greenwood |year = 1977 |isbn = 0837195128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great War==
With the outbreak of the [[Great War]] in 1914, Krueger was offered a post as an observer with the [[German Army]] but was forced to turn it down due to familial commitments. Instead, he was posted to the [[110th Infantry Regiment (United States)|10th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[Pennsylvania Army National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;Holzimmer, ''Krueger'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; The regiment was mobilized on 23 June 1916 and served along the Mexican border for five months as part of the [[Pancho Villa Expedition|Mexican Punitive Expedition]] under General [[John J. Pershing]], although no Guard units fought Mexican troops. The unit was mustered out in October 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmva.state.pa.us/paarng/cwp/view.asp?A=3&amp;QUESTION_ID=442676 Brief History of the 110th Infantry]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States commenced hostilities in [[World War I]], Krueger became Assistant Chief of Staff G-3 (Operations) of the 
[[U.S. 84th Infantry Division]] at [[Camp Zachary Taylor]]. He became its chief of staff, with the rank of [[Major (rank)|Major]] as of 5 August 1917. In February 1918, he was sent to [[Langres]] to attend the [[American Expeditionary Force]] General Staff School. In May 1918, all officers whose division was not under orders for France were ordered to return home but Krueger stayed on as G-3 of the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Infantry Division]]. Apparently the [[French Army]] requested that Krueger be sent home due to his German origin and Krueger was re-posted to the 84th Division, but he soon returned, as it embarked for France in August 1918. In October 1918, he became Chief of Staff of the Tank Corps. Following the end of the war, Krueger was assistant chief of staff of [[U.S. VI Corps|VI]] and [[U.S. IV Corps|IV Corps]] on occupation duty, advancing to the rank of temporary [[colonel]]. For his service in France, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United States)|Distinguished Service Medal]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Holzimmer, ''Krueger'', pp. 26-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar years==
With the end of the war, Krueger reverted to his permanent rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]] on 30 June 1920 but was promoted to the permanent rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] the next day. After periods at the [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], [[Fort Benning, Georgia]], and in command of the 55th Infantry Regiment at [[Camp Funston, Kansas]], Krueger attended the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]], graduating in 1921, and remaining for a year as an instructor. From  1922 to 1925, he served in the War Plans Division of the U.S. Army [[General Staff]]. In 1927 he tried to transfer to the [[United States Army Air Corps]] but his flight instructor, [[Lieutenant]] [[Claire Lee Chennault]] flunked him. Krueger graduated from the [[Naval War College]] in 1926, and from 1928 to 1932 he was an instructor there.&lt;ref&gt;Holzimmer, ''Krueger'', pp. 31-47&lt;/ref&gt;  

Krueger commanded the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th Infantry]] at [[Jefferson Barracks]] from 1932 to 1934, then returned to the War Plans Division, becoming chief of the division in May 1936. He was promoted to temporary [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] in October 1936. In June 1938, Krueger went to [[Fort George G. Meade]] as commander of the 16th Infantry Brigade. He was promoted to temporary [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] in February 1939, commanded the [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]] at [[Fort Sam Houston]] rising in October 1939 to the command of [[U.S. VIII Corps|VIII Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;Holzimmer, ''Krueger'', pp. 49-76&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
[[File:Kruger, MacArthur and Marshall.jpg|thumb|left|Generals Krueger, MacArthur and Marshall]]
In May 1941, Krueger was promoted to temporary [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]], in command of the [[U.S. Third Army]] and the [[Southern Defense Command]], a post he held for more than a year after the U.S entered [[World War II]].
[[File:Gen Walter Krueger.jpg|thumb|General Krueger]]
A month after the activation of the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]], in January 1943, Krueger took command of the army, based in [[Australia]]. He remained in command of the Sixth Army &amp;mdash; which included in various combinations at different times [[I Corps (United States)|I]], [[X Corps (United States)|X]], [[XIV Corps (United States)|XIV]] and [[XXIV Corps (United States)|XXIV Corps]] &amp;mdash; throughout its combat duties. These included the assaults on [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] positions on [[Kiriwina]] and [[Woodlark Island]]s (July 1943) as part of [[Operation Coronet]]; [[New Britain]] (December 1943-February 1944); [[Admiralty Islands]] (FebruaryâMay 1944); mainland [[New Guinea]] (JulyâAugust 1944); [[Morotai]] ([[Netherlands East Indies]], SeptemberâOctober 1944); [[Leyte]] and [[Mindoro]] (the  Philippines, OctoberâDecember 1944); and [[Luzon]] (JanuaryâFebruary 1945).

In November 1943, Krueger formed a top secret ad hoc unit called the [[Alamo Scouts]]. Named for his beloved association with San Antonio, Texas, and the Alamo, Krueger envisioned that the Alamo Scouts, consisting of small teams of highly trained volunteers, would operate deep behind enemy lines to provide intelligence-gathering and tactical reconnaissance in advance of Sixth U.S. Army landing operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alamoscouts.org/special_forces/history.htm|title=History of the Alamo Scouts |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work= |publisher=Alamo Scouts Association |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krueger was promoted to temporary [[General (United States)|General]] (four-star) in March 1945. In September 1945, the Sixth Army took up occupation duty in [[Japan]]. In January 1946 it was deactivated and Krueger reverted to lieutenant general. However, he retired as a full general in July 1946.

==Later life==
Krueger retired to [[San Antonio, Texas]], where he bought a house for the first time. In retirement, he wrote ''From Down Under to Nippon: the Story of the 6th Army In World War II'', which was published in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holzimmer, Krueger, pp. 242-245&quot;&gt;Holzimmer, ''Krueger'', pp. 242-245&lt;/ref&gt;

His retirement was marred by family tragedies. His son James was dismissed from the Army in 1947 for [[Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman|conduct unbecoming an officer]]. Grace's health deteriorated and she died on 13 May 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holzimmer, Krueger, pp. 242-245&quot;/&gt; In 1952,  Dorothy fatally stabbed her husband, Colonel Aubrey Dewitt Smith, with a hunting knife while he slept in their Army quarters in occupied Japan. By six votes to three, a U.S. Army court-martial found her guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced her &quot;to be confined at hard labor for the rest of her natural life&quot; (a unanimous verdict of guilty would have made the death sentence mandatory).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = Neurotic Explosion |newspaper = TIME |date = 19 January 1953 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820912,00.html |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the [[US Supreme Court]] ruled that military trials of civilians were unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/350/11/case.html ''Toth v. Quarles'' (1955)]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dorothy was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title = We Want Them Accountable |newspaper = TIME |date = 5 December 1955 |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893199,00.html |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court considered the issue of the jurisdiction of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] to civilian dependents of service personnel stationed overseas and initially affirmed the conviction of Dorothy Krueger Smith in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/351/470/case.html ''Kinsella v. Krueger'' (1956)]&lt;/ref&gt; but reversed itself in 1957, overturning her conviction.

In 1962, [[Krueger Middle School]] was established in [[San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teacher.neisd.net/edtech/ComRel/campusdetail.cfm?cOrg=043 |title=Walter Krueger Middle School |accessdate=2008-06-30 |work= |publisher=North East Independent School District |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krueger died at [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania]] in 1967 and was buried in Section 30 of [[Arlington National Cemetery]], among a number of family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wkrueger.htm|title=Walter Krueger|accessdate=2008-06-30 |work=Arlington National Cemetery Website |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krueger was portrayed by actor [[Dale Dye]] in the 2005 war film ''[[The Great Raid]]'', a little-known true story of the rescue of American POWs from the notorious Cabanatuan Japanese POW camp on Luzon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0326905/fullcredits|title=Full Cast and Crew for ''The Great Raid''(2005)|accessdate=2008-06-30 |work=Internet Movie Database |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
