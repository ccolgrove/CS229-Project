'''Ali Hussein Rehema Al-Ka'abi''' ({{lang-ar|'''Ø¹ÙÙ Ø­Ø³ÙÙ Ø±Ø­ÙÙØ© Ø§ÙÙØ¹Ø¨Ù'''}}) (born on August 8, 1985 in [[Iraq]]) is an Iraqi [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who is a [[Defender (football)|Defender]] for [[Al-Wakra Sports Club|Al-Wakra]] in [[Qatar]]. He has represented the [[Iraq national football team]].

== Info ==

Since playing every minute of Iraq's title-winning campaign at the 2007 AFC Asian Cup, Ali Rehema has established his status as one the team's defensive stalwarts. He held on to his regular place during Iraq's failed 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa qualifying bid, starting seven of the team's eight games. 
While recent years have seen a number of players come and go with the national side, Rehema remains a key man at the back due to his consistent performances. His well-earned reputation as a dependable defender also ensures that he holds the respect and admiration of his peers at club level. After plying his trade with Al Talaba, Al Quwa Al Jawiya and Arbil FC, Rehema earned his first international move when he was signed by Libyan giants Al-Ahly in 2007. After spending a season with the Tripoli-based club, he was attracted to Qatari outfits Al Wakra, where he continues to play to this day. 

Aside from shoring up the Iraqi defence, Rehema can also play the role as the defensive midfielder in their 4-5-1 formation, protecting the back four while launching counter-attacks from deep.
