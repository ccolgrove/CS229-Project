'''Law Enforcement in Egypt''' is the responsibility of the [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Ministry of Interior]] of [[Egypt]].

==National organization==

The [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Ministry of Interior]] divides the functions of the police and public security among four deputy ministers of interior while the Minister of Interior himself retained responsibility for [[state security]] (El [[Mukhabarat]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rough Guide to Egypt|date=August, 2007 |page=58|publisher=Rough Guides|location=New York |isbn=9781843537823}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigations and overall organization.

There are four Deputy Ministers:
* [[Public Security]] responsible for [[public safety]] (inc [[Municipal Police]]), travel, [[emigration]], [[passport]]s, [[port security]], and [[criminal investigation]].
* [[Special Police]] responsible for prison administration, the [[Central Security Forces]], [[civil defense]], police transport, police communications, [[traffic police]], and Tourism and Antiquities Police.
* Personnel Affairs was responsible for police-training institutions, personnel matters for police and civilian employees, and the Policemen's Sports Association.
* Administrative and Financial Affairs responsible for general administration, budgets, supplies, and legal matters.

==Regional organization==
In each the [[Governorates of Egypt]] (sing. ''muhafazah''; pl., ''muhafazat''), the presidentially appointed [[governor]] and a director of police command all police and maintain public order. Both the governor and the director of police report to the Ministry of Interior on all security matters. The governor reports directly to the minister or to a deputy while the director of police reports through regular police channels. In the governorate's [[Subdivisions_of_Egypt#District|subdivisions]] there are district police commandants with the authority and functions that were similar to the director at the governorate level.

The urban police have more modern facilities and equipment, such as computers and communications equipment, while the smaller more remote village police have less sophisticated facilities and equipment. The police became increasingly motorised and it is now rare to see an officer on foot patrol except in city or town centres, and then rarely alone. An increasing number of urban centres police [[bicycle]] units are used to provide a quick response in congested areas, pedestrianised areas and parkland, as well as carrying out [[patrol]]s.

==Training==
Almost all commissioned officers were graduates of the Police College at Cairo where police had to complete a three-month course at the college. The Police College is a modern institution equipped with laboratory and physical-training facilities. The police force also sent some officers abroad for schooling.

The Police College offers a two-year program which includes: security administration, [[criminal investigation]], [[military drill]]s, civil defense, [[fire fighting]], [[forensic medicine]], communications, [[cryptology]], [[first aid]], [[sociology]], [[anatomy]], and foreign languages ([[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]]). Also included are: political orientation, [[public relations]], and military subjects (such as infantry and cavalry training), [[marksmanship]], leadership, and field exercises. Graduates receive a [[bachelor]] of police studies degree and are commissioned [[first lieutenant]]s.

Advanced officer training was given at the college's Institute for Advanced Police Studies, completion of which was required for advancement beyond the rank of [[lieutenant colonel]]. The college's three-month course for enlisted personnel is conducted in a military atmosphere but emphasizes police methods and techniques.

==Uniforms and equipment==
===Ranks===
Police rank insignia were the same as those used by the army. Commissioned police ranks resembled those of the [[Egyptian army]]. The highest-ranking police officer was a [[major general]] and ranks descended only to first lieutenant. Enlisted police ranks are [[master sergeant]], [[sergeant]], [[corporal]], and [[private (rank)|private]].

===Police uniforms===
Police uniforms are similar to army uniforms with the service uniform for the ground forces was [[khaki drill]] cotton. However, enlisted police personnel wear a black wool [[bush jacket]] and pants in the winter and a white cotton bush jacket and pants in the summer. Certain police personnel also wear a blue or black [[beret]].

===Equipment===
Egyptian law enforcement police officers generally carry M&amp;P357, [[CZ 75|CZ 75B]] or [[Glock pistol]] when on regular duty, however, heavy arms are always available at police stations. These include [[submachine gun]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, [[shotguns]] and [[carbines]], while special units may also have additional weapons like [[Flash bang grenade|Flash bang]] and stinger tear gas grenades, [[H&amp;K USP]] series and [[SIG Sauer]] series [[pistols]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch MP5]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch UMP]] and [[FN P90]] submachine guns, [[M14 rifle]], the [[Remington 700P]] and some [[.50 caliber]] sniper rifles.

Tourism and Antiquities Police covering every single spot tourists could go to like sites, museums, hotels, etc. such as the [[Great Pyramid of Giza|Great Pyramid]] of [[Giza]], [[Memphis]] [[Giza]], [[Egyptian Museum]], etc. in [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]] - [[Qaitbay]] Citadel and the [[Serapium]] Temple and [[Pompeys Pillar]], etc., going through all cities in Egypt carrying same weapons as law enforcement police.

===Transport===
Unlike in many other countries, the Egyptian police extensively use [[SUV]]s. The Egyptian produced [[Jeep]] vehicle used to be the most common police car in Egypt but in recent years, other similar vehicles have also come into police use. SUVs are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. Depending upon the location, the police vehicles may have individual revolving lights ([[strobe lights]]) or [[light bar]]s, [[siren]]s etc. An extensive modernisation drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Traffic Police vehicles generally also have equipment like speed [[radar]]s, breath analysers and emergency [[first aid kit]]s. Color schemes of police vehicles vary according to their location and which directorate they belong to.

For traffic regulation and patrolling in cities, [[motorcycle]]s are also used. This is because of increasing congestion in cities where the heavier bikes would prove to be unwieldy when compared to the nimbler handling the newer bikes were capable of. The bikes are provided with two-way radios, strobes and sirens and are generally painted white. Some cities make use of [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] as patrol vehicles or high speed 'interceptors' on highways. Of late, the various police forces are on a modernisation drive, upgrading and revamping their fleet with new vehicles.

==Relations with public==

The police in Egypt have lost some prestige since the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|2011 Revolution]].  According to one source (csmonitor.org), the Egyptian police, &quot;once feared by civilians, are now seen as leftover elements of Mubarakâs regime and treated with little respect. Pulled off the streets after violently cracking down on protests in January, they are now trying to reshape their role in the post-Mubarak Egypt.&quot;&lt;ref name=csm&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0629/Cairo-clashes-highlight-tensions-between-Egyptian-police-public?cmpid=ema:nws:World%20Daily%2006292011&amp;cmpid=ema:nws:NzI5NjYzNTI3NwS2 Cairo clashes highlight tensions between Egyptian police, public]| by Sarah Lynch| June 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Police brutality]] is credited with being one of the causes of the revolution,&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP-egyptbraces&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110125-egypt-braces-nationwide-protests|title=Egypt braces for nationwide protests|author=AFP|publisher=France24|date=25 January 2011|accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of June 2011 several police officers are being tried for the killing of &quot;hundreds of demonstrators&quot; during the revolution. According to government statistics, 90 police stations have been burnt since the start of the revolution.&lt;ref name=csm/&gt; The government has taken steps to address public concerns and police demoralization.&lt;ref name=csm/&gt;
In response to a planned July 8 rally protesting the release on bail of police accused of murdering protesters during the revolution, interim interior minister [[Mansour al-Essawy]] promised to purge up to 700 corrupt senior police officers. However protesters complained that five months after the revolution where almost 1000 people were killed, only one officer has been convicted of wrongdoing and he has not yet been incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/07/muslim-brotherhood-joins-tahrir-square-protest Muslim Brotherhood to join Tahrir Square demonstration], Jack Shenker| guardian.co.uk| 7 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
