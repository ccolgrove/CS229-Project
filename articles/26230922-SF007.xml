The '''''Nobel Peace Prize''''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''{{lang|da|{{lang|sv|{{lang|no|Nobels fredspris}}}}}}'') is one of the five [[Nobel Prize]]s bequeathed by the Swedish industrialist and inventor [[Alfred Nobel]].

==Background==
[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Alfred Nobel]]]]
According to Nobel's will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who

{{cquote|...shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/short_testamente.html | accessdate = 2008-03-31 | title = Excerpt from the Will of Alfred Nobel | publisher = [[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alfred Nobel's will further specified that the prize be awarded by a committee of five people chosen by the Norwegian Parliament. 

Nobel died in 1896 and he did not leave an explanation for choosing [[peace]] as a prize category. As he was a trained chemical engineer,  the categories for [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] were obvious choices. The reasoning behind the peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, his friendship with [[Bertha von Suttner]], a peace activist and later winner of the prize, profoundly influenced his decision to include peace as a category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why Norway?&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Nobel scholars suggest it was Nobel's way to compensate for developing destructive forces. His inventions included [[dynamite]] and [[ballistite]], both of which were used violently during his lifetime. Ballistite was used in war &lt;ref&gt;Altman, L. (2006). [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/health/26docs.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=919b88628e82140e&amp;ex=1160884800 Alfred Nobel and the prize that almost didn't happen]. ''New York Times''. Retrieved 14 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], an Irish nationalist organization, carried out dynamite attacks in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/profiles/po17.shtml BBC History - 1916 Easter Rising - Profiles - The Irish Republican Brotherhood] ''BBC''&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel was also instrumental in turning [[Bofors]] from an iron and steel company to an armaments company.

It is unclear why Nobel wished the Peace Prize to be administered in Norway, which was [[personal union|ruled]] in [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]] at the time of Nobel's death. The Norwegian Nobel Committee speculates that Nobel may have considered Norway better suited to awarding the prize, as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as Sweden.  It also notes that at the end of the nineteenth century, the [[Norwegian parliament]] had become closely involved in the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]'s efforts to resolve conflicts through mediation and arbitration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why Norway?&quot;/&gt;

Nominations must usually be submitted to the Committee by the beginning of February in the award year.  Nominations by committee members can be submitted up to the date of the first Committee meeting after this deadline.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomination&quot;/&gt;

In 2009, a record 205 nominations were received,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/eu_nobel_peace |title=&quot;President Barack Obama wins Nobel Peace Prize&quot;|publisher=Associated Press on yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the record was broken again in 2010 with 237 nominations; in 2011, the record was broken once again with 241 nominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_committee/nomination-2011/|title=Nominations for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|accessdate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statutes of the Nobel Foundation do not allow information about nominations, considerations or investigations relating to awarding the prize to be made public for at least 50 years after a prize has been awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelpeaceprize.org/en_GB/nomination_committee/nomination-2009/|title=Nominations for the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize|publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Committee|date= |accessdate=2009-10-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time many individuals have become known as &quot;Nobel Peace Prize Nominees&quot;, but this designation has no official standing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/nominators.html Who may submit nominations - Nobels fredspris ]&lt;/ref&gt; Nominations from 1901 to 1956, however, have been released in a database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/database.html |title=Nomination Database&amp;nbsp;â The Nobel Peace Prize, 1901-1956 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Selection===
Nominations are considered by the Nobel Committee at a meeting where a short list of candidates for further review is created.  This short list is then considered by permanent advisers to the Nobel institute, which consists of the Institute's Director and the Research Director and a small number of Norwegian academics with expertise in subject areas relating to the prize.  Advisers usually have some months to complete reports, which are then considered by the Committee to select the laureate.  The Committee seeks to achieve a unanimous decision, but this is not always possible. The Nobel Committee typically comes to a conclusion in mid-September, but occasionally the final decision has not been made until the last meeting before the official announcement at the beginning of October.&lt;ref name=&quot;selection&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Awarding the prize==

The [[Norwegian Nobel Committee|Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee]] presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the [[Monarchy of Norway|King of Norway]] on 10 December each year (the anniversary of Nobel's death). The Peace Prize is the only Nobel Prize not presented in [[Stockholm]]. The Nobel laureate receives a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/award_ceremonies/prize.html What the Nobel Laureates Receive]. nobelprize.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2009, the prize was worth 10 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]] (about US$1.4 million). Since 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony is held at the [[Oslo City Hall]].

From 1947 to 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held in the [[University of Oslo]] atrium, a few hundred metres from the Oslo City Hall. Between 1905 and 1946, the ceremony took place at the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]]. From 1901 to 1904, the ceremony took place in the [[Storting]] (Parliament).&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelpeaceprize.org/nb_NO/about_peaceprize/award_ceremony/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==

Unlike the scientific and literary Nobel Prizes, usually issued in [[retrospective|retrospect]] often two or three decades after the awarded achievement, the Peace Prize has been awarded for more recent or immediate achievements, or with the intention of encouraging future achievements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Some commentators&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Murphy |first=Clare|title=The Nobel: Dynamite or damp squib?|newspaper=BBC online|publisher=BBC News|date=10 August 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3724734.stm|accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that to award a peace prize on the basis of unquantifiable contemporary opinion is unjust or possibly erroneous, especially as many of the judges cannot themselves be said to be impartial observers.

In 2011 a [[feature story]] in the Norwegian newspaper [[Aftenposten]] contended that major criticisms of the award were that &quot;[[Nobel Committee]]'' ought to recruit members with [more of a] professional and international background... that can do just as good a job as retired [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s of Norway&quot;; that &quot;there is too little openness about the criteria that the committee uses when they choose a recipient of the prize&quot;; and that &quot;the adherence to Nobel's will should be more strict&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Arild AspÃ¸y{{!}}AspÃ¸y, Arild]]|title=Fredsprisens grÃ¥soner|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=2011-10-04|page=4|quote=Nobelkomiteen bÃ¸r ta inn medlemmer med faglig og internasjonal bakgrunn... som gjÃ¸re en like god jobb som pensjonerte stortingsrepresentanter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Norwegian historian [[Ãivind Stenersen]], Norway has been able to use the prize as an instrument for nation building and furthering Norway's foreign policy and economic interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=[[Arild AspÃ¸y{{!}}AspÃ¸y, Arild]]|title=Fredsprisens grÃ¥soner|newspaper=Aftenposten|date=2011-10-04|page=4|quote=Aldri tidligere hadde fredsprisen vÃ¦rt et bedre instrument for nasjonsbygging og en mer verdifull stÃ¸tte for norsk utenrikspolitikk og Ã¸konomiske interesser}}&lt;/ref&gt;
