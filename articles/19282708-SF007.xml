[[Patrick Baudry]], an earlier astronaut, was also born in Africa; however, Baudry's native Cameroon was a French [[colony]] at the time of his birth, he is considered a French citizen. Shuttleworth also had British citizenship at the time of his flight.&lt;/ref&gt; Shuttleworth founded [[Canonical Ltd.]] and as of 2010, provides leadership for the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;rich-list-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://extras.timesonline.co.uk/richlist2009/giving.pdf|title=Rich List 2009: Mark Shuttleworth|work=Sunday Times|location=London|date=2009-04-26|quote=Results for 2009, Ranking: 362, Worth: Â£150m|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives on the [[Isle of Man]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markshuttleworth.com/biography|title=Mark Shuttleworth - Biography|publisher=Mark Shuttleworth|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and holds [[multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] of [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/science/article6719149.ece|title=It's blast-off Britain as ban on space flight ends|work=The Sunday Times|location=London|date=2009-07-19|accessdate=2011-09-11|first1=Jonathan|last1=Leake|first2=Steven|last2=Swinford|quote=Mark Shuttleworth, a South African entrepreneur with dual British nationality, took a different route, paying Â£12m for Russia â¦}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Shuttleworth was born in [[Welkom]], [[Free State]], [[South Africa]] as a son of a surgeon and a nursery school teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-vance&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Ashlee | last = Vance | authorlink = Ashlee Vance | title = A Software Populist Who Doesn't Do Windows | curly = y | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/business/11ubuntu.html?pagewanted=all | date = 2009-01-10 | accessdate = 2009-01-12 | work = New York Times | quote=charismatic 35-year-old billionaire from South Africa ... son of a surgeon and a kindergarten teacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attending school at [[Rondebosch Boys' High School]] and then [[Western Province Preparatory School]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2009|reason=Diocesan lists him as an alumnus, but Rondebosch has no such prominent reference. Did he attend Rondebosch?  ...Apparently only for one term}} and [[Diocesan College]], Shuttleworth obtained a [[Business Science]] degree in [[Finance]] and [[Management information systems|Information Systems]] at the [[University of Cape Town]]. He lived in [[Smuts Hall]], where he was involved in the installation of the first residential Internet connections at the university.

== Work ==
Shuttleworth founded [[Thawte]] in 1995, which specialised in [[digital certificate]]s and [[Internet security]] and then sold it to [[VeriSign]] in December 1999, earning [[South African rand|R]]&amp;nbsp;3.5&amp;nbsp;billion (about [[United States dollar|US$]]&amp;nbsp;575&amp;nbsp;million at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/266911/VeriSign-Buys-South-Africas-Thawte-for-575-Million.htm | title=VeriSign Buys South Africa's Thawte for $575 Million | date=1999-12-23 |work=InternetNews.com |accessdate=2010-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2000, Shuttleworth formed [[HBD Venture Capital]], a [[business incubator]] and [[venture capital]] provider. In March 2004 he formed [[Canonical Ltd.]], for the promotion and commercial support of [[free software]] projects. In December 2009, Shuttleworth stepped down as the C.E.O. of Canonical,&amp;nbsp;Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/295 |title=My new focus at Canonical |author=Mark Shuttleworth |date=2009-12-17 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in Linux and FOSS==
In the 1990s, Shuttleworth participated as one of the developers of the [[Debian]] [[operating system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://db.debian.org/ | title = debian.org Developers LDAP Search | publisher = The [[Debian]] Project | quote = User Mark Shuttleworth (login &quot;marks&quot;, PGP/GPG key id 0xD54F0847) | accessdate = 2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he formed the [[Shuttleworth Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to social innovation which also funds educational, [[free software|free]], and [[open source software]] projects in South Africa, such as the [[Freedom Toaster]].

In 2004 he returned to the [[free software]] world by funding the development of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], a [[Linux distribution]] based on Debian, through his company [[Canonical Ltd.]]

[[File:Mark-Shuttleworth-Ubuntu-fr-Karmic.jpg|thumb|Mark Shuttleworth delivering a talk during the Ubuntu Party in Paris in Nov. 2009]]

In 2005 he founded the [[Ubuntu Foundation]] and made an initial investment of 10 million dollars. In the Ubuntu project, Shuttleworth is often referred to with the tongue-in-cheek title ''Self-Appointed [[Benevolent Dictator for Life]]'', abbreviated ''SABDFL''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ubuntu carves niche in Linux landscape |url=http://news.com.com/Ubuntu+carves+niche+in+Linux+landscape/2100-7344_3-5886194.html |publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To come up with a list of names of people to hire for the project, Shuttleworth took six months of Debian [[mailing list]] archives with him while travelling to [[Antarctica]] aboard the [[icebreaker]] [[Kapitan Khlebnikov (icebreaker)|Kapitan Khlebnikov]] in early 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linux Format]], [http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/waugh.html Jeff Waugh (LXF 87)].&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, he purchased a 65% stake of [[Impi Linux]].&lt;ref name=&quot;impi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mybroadband.co.za/nephp/?m=show&amp;id=828|title=Shuttleworth bets on ImpiLinux|date=29 September 2005|publisher=MyADSL|accessdate=2006-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2006 it was announced that Mark Shuttleworth became the first patron of [[KDE]], the highest level of [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] available.&lt;ref name=&quot;kdepatron&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dot.kde.org/2006/10/15/mark-shuttleworth-becomes-first-patron-kde|title=Mark Shuttleworth Becomes the First Patron of KDE|date=15 October 2006|publisher=KDE|accessdate=2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2009 Mark announced that, effective March 2010, he would step down as CEO of Canonical to focus energy on product design, partnership and customers. [[Jane Silber]], COO at Canonical since 2004, took on the job of CEO at Canonical.&lt;ref name=&quot;ceo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/295|title=Mark Shuttleworth steps down as CEO of Canonical|date=17 December 2009|publisher=Mark Shuttleworth|accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, he received an honorary degree from the [[Open University]] for this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.open.ac.uk/students/ceremonies/files/ceremonies/file/graduate-directory-2010.pdf|work=Conferment of Honorary Degrees and Presentation of Graduates|publisher=The [[Open University]]|date=2010-02-25|accessdate=2010-09-21|title=Honorary Awards 2010|quote=Mr Mark Shuttleworth, DUniv, Versailles, 11 September|pages=8, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spaceflight==
[[Image:Mark Shuttleworth NASA.jpg|thumb|Shuttleworth on board the International Space Station]]Shuttleworth gained worldwide fame on 25 April 2002 as the second self-funded [[Space tourism|space tourist]] and the first ever [[Africa]]n in space. Flying through [[Space Adventures]], he launched aboard the [[Russia]]n [[Soyuz TM-34]] mission as a [[spaceflight participant]], paying approximately [[United States dollar|US$]] 20 million for the voyage. Two days later, the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] arrived at the [[International Space Station]], where he spent eight days participating in experiments related to [[AIDS]] and [[genome]] research. On 5 May 2002, he returned to Earth on [[Soyuz TM-33]]. In order to participate in the flight, Shuttleworth had to undergo one year of training and preparation, including seven months spent in [[Star City, Russia]].

While in space he had a radio conversation with [[Nelson Mandela]] and a 14 year old South African girl, Michelle Foster, who asked him to marry her. He politely dodged the question, stating that he was &quot;very honoured at the question&quot; before changing the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Space.com, [http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/mandela_shuttleworth_020502.html Nelson Mandela Chats with Shuttleworth], 2002-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt; The terminally ill Miss Foster was provided the opportunity to have a conversation with Mark Shuttleworth and Nelson Mandela by the [[Reach for a Dream]] foundation.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2012307.stm Afronaut mourns his 'bride'], 2002-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dispatch online, [http://www.dispatch.co.za/2002/05/28/southafrica/CANCER.HTM Mark's biggest fan dies of cancer], 2002-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport ==
He has a private jet, a [[Bombardier Global Express]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Airliners.net]]: [http://www.airliners.net/open.file/0805262 Bombardier BD-700-1A10 Global Express]&lt;/ref&gt; which is often referred to as ''Canonical One''&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/Issue16#head-54c204893e3c82b8629568b7372811780fcc50a4 Ubuntu News #16: ''Akademy 2006'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ask [[Slashdot]]: ''Mark Shuttleworth [http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/04/1859255 &quot;Canonical One doesn't *actually* belong to Canonical&quot;]''&lt;/ref&gt; but is in fact owned through his ''HBD Venture Capital'' company. The dragon depicted on the side of the plane is &quot;Norman&quot;, the [[HBD Venture Capital]] mascot.
