'''Goose Lake''' is a large [[alkali]]ne [[glacial lake]] located in the [[Goose Lake Valley]] on the [[Oregon]]-[[California]] border.  The north end of the lake is in [[Lake County, Oregon]] and the south end is in [[Modoc County, California]].  The mountains at the north end of the lake are part of the [[Fremont National Forest]] and the south end of the lake is adjacent to [[Modoc National Forest]] lands.  Most of the valley property around the lake is privately owned agricultural land, though [[Goose Lake State Recreation Area]] is on the Oregon side of the lake.

Goose Lake is the center of is a semi-closed [[drainage basin]]. Its watershed is normally [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]], but sometimes flows into the [[Pit River]], part of the [[Sacramento River]] watershed. During the 1970s and 1980s the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] defined Goose Lake as part of the Sacramento's watershed,&lt;ref name=huc&gt;{{cite web |title= Boundary Descriptions and Names of Regions, Subregions, Accounting Units and Cataloging Units |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] |url= http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/huc_name.html |accessdate= 16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has redefined Goose Lake's watershed as a closed basin.&lt;ref name=WBD&gt;{{cite web|title=Watershed Boundary Dataset|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]], National Cartography and Geospatial Center|url=http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/watershed/|accessdate=September 4, 2010}} [[ArcExplorer]] [[Geographic information system|GIS]] data viewer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Goose Lake is part of a [[Trough (geology)|geological trough]] which runs from Oregon southward past [[Death Valley]], the [[Walker Lane]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Goose Lake attracts wildlife watchers, campers, and boaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregonstateparks.org/park_1.php |title=Goose Lake State Recreation Area |publisher=OREGON.gov |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is habitat to many flora and fauna including [[Western Grebe]], [[Long-billed Curlew]], and a large herd of [[mule deer]] which spend much of the time in the 48-site campground.

The park provides hot showers, grassy areas suitable for tents, paved sites, shade trees, fireplaces, electrical hookups, telephone, and a dump station.  The campground is open mid-April to mid-October.

Recreational activities on or around the lake include kayaking, canoeing, and hunting, but not fishing.  When the lake is full, it has a maximum depth of {{convert|24|ft|m}}.

The lake is located near the historic [[Fandango Pass]] route used to enter California by 19th century settlers. In the mid-19th century, particularly during the [[California Gold Rush]], the ''Applegate-Lassen Cut-Off'' of the [[California Trail]] left the main route of that Trail near present-day [[Rye Patch Reservoir]], and crossed the [[Black Rock Desert]], on the way to Goose Lake and the California gold fields.  The ''Lassen Cut-Off'' continued down the [[Pit River]] into California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]], while the [[Applegate Cut-Off]] went into southern Oregon along the [[Lost River (California)|Lost River]].

The lake completely dried up in the years 1851, 1852, 1926, 1929â1934, and 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Goose Lake - Fish, Wildlife and Rare Plants | url=http://www.pitriveralliance.net/resource/gooselke/goosfish.html | publisher=Pit River Watershed Alliance | date=10 October 2007 | accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, Goose Lake was the regular source of the Pit River, which flows into California's [[Sacramento River]], but water diversion has caused the lake level to drop below its outlet. The Pit River's source is now south of Goose Lake and the lake's salinity is increasing, threatening fish populations. During rare high water levels, Goose Lake still spills into the Pit River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Welcome to the Pit River Watershed Alliance | url=http://www.pitriveralliance.net/ | publisher=Pit River Watershed Alliance | date=10 October 2007 | accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
