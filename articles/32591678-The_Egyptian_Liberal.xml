==Background==
{{main|1964 Hama riot|April 1981 Hama massacre|Hama massacre}}
Hama has been the epicenter of [[Syrian uprising]]s since the very event of the [[1963 Syrian coup d'Ã©tat|1963 Ba'athist coup]]. As early as 1964, a widescale [[1964 Hama riot|riot]], often described as [[1964 Hama riot|uprising]], broke out in the city, and was violently suppressed by the military, resulting in more than 70 citizens killed. Violence occurred once again during the 1976â1982 [[Islamic uprising in Syria]], when hundreds of Hama citizens were executed in the [[April 1981 Hama massacre|April 1981 crackdown]], whereas in February 1982, a much larger scale [[Hama massacre|massacre]] took place in Hama, following an armed and organized [[Hama massacre|uprising of Islamic groups]], centered in the city. The 1982 [[Hama massacre]] claimed the lives of some 10,000 - 25,000 Hama citizens and Islamic militants and as many as 1,000 Syrian Army personnel.

==History==
===Prelude===
Disturbances in Hama began on 3 June 2011, primarily in the city center, and on occasion in the suburbs. The Syrian security forces shot dead up to 25 people when they dispersed a demonstration by tens of locals in the city of Hama on Friday 3 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=8216at-least-25-dead8217-in-hama-syria-rallies-reach-capital-2011-06-03 |title=âAt least 25 deadâ in Hama, Syria rallies reach capital |publisher=Hurriyet Daily News |date= |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2011, with more than 400,000 protestors, Hama witnessed the largest demonstration against [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Soon after, Assad sacked Hama's governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans |first=Dominic |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/02/us-syria-protests-idUSTRE7601NA20110702 |title=Syria's Assad sacks Hama governor after protests |publisher=Reuters |date= 2 July 2011|accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days after, Syrian tanks deployed at Hama,&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; in an operation that led to more than 20 civilians killed by the Syrian security forces and two rape cases were witnessed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

===The siege===

{{Wikinews|More than 100 reported dead after Syrian troops move against protesters}}
As the city of Hama became one of the main opposition centers of the [[2011 Syrian uprising|popular uprising]], taking place in Syria, Hama turned into a focal point of growing violence. An armed blockade was imposed on the city on 3 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

On 6 July, a surprising step was taken by the US ambassador, [[Robert Stephen Ford|Robert Ford]], when he visited Hama and declared that he will stay there till Friday. Syria reacted with anger with this visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin Chulov |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jul/08/syria-condemns-us-ambassador-visit-hama |title=Syria condemns US ambassador's 'provocative' visit to Hama |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date= 8 July 2011|accessdate=3 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 July, more than 500,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/07/2011780473138345.html |title='Half a million' protest on streets of Hama - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syrians flooded through the city of Hama, according to activists, in what they claim was the single biggest protest yet against the embattled government of President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Demonstrators in Hama have received the US ambassadors with flowers to express their gratitude of the visit and to reach their voices to the world.

JJ Harder, the press attachÃ© of the US embassy in [[Damascus]], later told [[Al Jazeera]]: &quot;Our ambassador Robert Ford was in Hama earlier this month, and he saw with his own eyes the violence that they are talking about. There was none. He maybe saw one teenager with a stick at a checkpoint, and the government is going on with these absolute fabrications about armed gangs running the streets of Hama and elsewhere. Hama has shown itself to be a model of peaceful protest. That was why our ambassador chose to go there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera2&quot;/&gt;

The French ambassador joined the US one on that day to show the French support to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110709-hama-protests-bolstered-visits-usa-france-ambassadors-ford-chevallier-syria-assad |title=French and US ambassador visits bolster Hama protests - SYRIA |publisher=FRANCE 24 |date=9 July 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

7 July had seen both the French and American ambassadors to [[Syria]] toured some of the nationâs hotspots. The American ambassador Robert Ford, had travelled, with the French ambassador [[Ãric Chevallier]] to the city of Hama in what Robert Ford said was a gesture of solidarity with local protesters there.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Malas |first=Nour |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303406104576445864072772194.html |title=Syria Revolt Fueled by Roof Fires and Tweets - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=15 July 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsday.com/news/us-ambassador-visits-under-siege-syrian-city-1.3010637 ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/death-squads-besiege-syrian-city-of-homs.html#ixzz1Ti3PwSxx |title=&quot;Death Squads&quot; Besiege Syrian City of Homs (VIDEO) &amp;#124; Care2 Causes |publisher=Care2.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/causes/death-squads-besiege-syrian-city-of-homs.html |title=&quot;Death Squads&quot; Besiege Syrian City of Homs (VIDEO) &amp;#124; Care2 Causes |publisher=Care2.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;channel1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/syrian-tank-assault-on-hama-kills-45 |title=Syrian tank assault on Hama 'kills 95' |publisher=Channel4.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July, more tanks were deployed around the outskirts of Hama, as part of a strengthening blockade, following protests involving an estimated 500,000 people the previous weekend.&lt;ref name=&quot;channel1&quot;/&gt; It has been estimated that up to 350,000 of the city's 700,000 population have taken part in many of the protests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8673547/Syria-dozens-dead-as-Assad-troops-launch-major-tank-offensive.html |title=Syria: dozens dead as Assad troops launch major tank offensive |publisher=Telegraph |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2011 |location=London |first=Adrian |last=Blomfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramadan events===
====29â30 July====
Over 500,000 citizens had rallied in the city on 29 July, following Muslim prayers in which a pro-rebel cleric told the congregation &quot;the regime must go&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/08/20118153040657423.html |title=Deadly Syrian crackdown continues - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Local support for the Assad regime had imploded by 30 July in both [[Homs]], [[Deir ez-Zor]] and [[Hama]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph1&quot;/&gt; President Assad sent his &quot;Terror Buses&quot; packed with private [[Alawite]] militia and party loyalists into Hama on 30 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Meld je aan of registreer je om een reactie te plaatsen! |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQfasMhwbLk&amp;NR=1 |title=âªSyria - Assad Terror Buses invade Hama - Alawite Militia and Tanks assault City 7-31-11â¬â |publisher=YouTube |date=8 June 2011 |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====31 July====
[[File:Ramadan Massacre.gif|thumb|Ramadan Massacre by [[Carlos Latuff]].]]
On the eve of [[Ramadan]], Syria witnessed the bloodiest day in its 139-day uprising against the single-party regime, in which the [[Alawi]]-run government has allegedly targeted [[Sunni]], [[Druze]] and [[Christian]] groups from across the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/syria/ramadan-eve-massacre-in-syria-1.845638 |title=Ramadan eve massacre in Syria |publisher=gulfnews |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdel Rahman of the Britain-based [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] said on 31 July that Syrian security forces launched an offensive at 5:00 am (0200 GMT) on [[Muadhamiya]], to the north, then encircled Hama shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HULIQ |url=http://www.huliq.com/1/syria-army-950-oppositionists-international-community-stays-silent |title=Syria: Army kills 95 oppositionists as international community stays silent |publisher=Huliq.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate incident on the same day, political prisoners attempted to mutiny in Hama's central prison, to which security forces responded with live ammunition. The death toll in the prison is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/08/02/160464.html |title=Hama residents defy siege, shelling to pray in the open |publisher=English.alarabiya.net |date= |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state news agency reported that eight policemen were killed in clashes in Hama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yacoub |first=Khaled |url=http://www.thestarphoenix.com/story_print.html?id=5187856&amp;sponsor= |title=Syrian tanks bombard residential areas of Hama |publisher=Thestarphoenix.com |date= |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has blamed much of the violence on terrorists and militants, who it says have killed hundreds of security personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/UN-Mulls-Syrian-Violence-as-Government-Crackdown-Continues-126582458.html |title=UN Debates Resolution Condemning Syria As Unrest Continues|publisher=Voanews.com |date=20 August 2009 |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 136 people have died, over 100 in Hama alone, and 19 in [[Deir ez-Zor]].

One Hama resident, a doctor who did not want to be identified for fear of arrest, told [[Reuters]] that tanks were attacking Hama from four different directions and &quot;firing randomly&quot;. Another resident said snipers had climbed onto the roofs of the state-owned electricity company and the main prison, and that electricity had been cut in eastern neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/07/201173143432348733.html |title='Scores dead' as Syrian tanks storm Hama city - Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Syrian government tanks also fired on [[mosques]] where the loudspeakers broadcast, &quot;Allah Akbar&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ben |first=Tzvi |url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/146245 |title=New Videos: Syria Tank Fire|publisher=Israel National News |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution condemning Syria was proposed by [[Russia]] and the Security Council met on the night of 31 July to debate the situation in Syria.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8675593/Syria-Bashar-al-Assads-tanks-renew-assault-on-Hama.html |title=Syria: Bashar al-Assad's tanks renew assault on Hama |publisher=Telegraph |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=2 August 2011 |location=London |first=Adrian |last=Blomfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syrian dissidents claimed that the tank assault on Hama on 31 July, in which 84 people had died, was an attempt to pacify and regain control of the city ahead of Ramadan and to avert protests during the holy month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters (7 hours ago) Today |url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/08/02/syrias-assad-embarks-on-path-of-no-return.html |title=Syriaâs Assad embarks on path of no return |publisher=Dawn.Com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1 August====
Syrian security forces continued to bombard Hama on 1 August. Many of Hama's residents braved the obvious danger to head to mosques for dawn prayers. As they emerged onto the streets, the shelling resumed. Three worshipers were struck down and killed, while a fourth was shot dead by a sniper as he got into his car, opposition activists said. Tank shells struck residential buildings in the suburbs of al-Qousour and Al-Hamidiya. &quot;The tanks are firing at random,&quot; one resident said. &quot;They don't care who they hit. The aim seems to be to kill and terrify as many people as possible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph1&quot;/&gt; &quot;The number of those wounded is huge and hospitals cannot cope, particularly because we lack the adequate equipment,&quot; said Hama hospital worker, Dr Abdel Rahman.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera1&quot;/&gt; &quot;It seems strange that the international community seems to care less about the people of Hama than the people of Benghazi,&quot; said Omar, a rebel activist in Damascus.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;/&gt; The death toll in Hama and Homs was reportedly âslightly enlargedâ according to the local governorate's sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilsherline.net.uk/news/arabworld/Srya/ hama -and -Homs âdead- reportedly â enlarged -188592.html#ixzz1637JT0E8]&lt;/ref&gt; Government tanks also moved in on the eastern town of Albu Kamal. In the nearby city of Deir al-Zour, had witnessed upwards to 29 over that weekend.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gulfnews1&quot;/&gt;

Activists and witnesses said at least 24 civilians were killed in attacks on several cities, including Hama, on 1 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews1&quot;/&gt; Later that day, The European Union imposed travel bans on five more military and government officials and extended sanctions against Assad's government, including Syrian [[Defence Minister]] [[Ali Habib Mahmud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews1&quot;/&gt;

====2 August====
The [[UN]]âs security council met to discuss the situation in Syria on 2 August. The [[United States|US]], [[UK]] and [[France]] wanted to formally condemn [[Syria]], but [[Russia]] and [[PRC|China]] were afraid that &quot;it could be used as a pretext for military intervention in Syria&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lizzy Davies, Nour Ali and agencies |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/02/syria-deaths-un-condemnation |title=Syria deaths continue as UN considers condemnation |publisher=Guardian |date= 2 August 2011|accessdate=2 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Derhally |first=Massoud A. |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-02/europe-submits-new-draft-un-resolution-condemning-syria-s-assad.html |title=Syria Targets Hama as EU Seeks Condemnation |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====3â4 August====
By the morning 3 August 2011, the city was under nearly continuous gunfire since the early hours of the morning and by midday Syrian army tanks stormed through rebelâs barricades in city of Hama, occupying a central square. A post on the [[Syrian Revolution Facebook page]] read &quot;The army is now stationed in [[Assi Square]],&quot; and &quot;The heroic youths of [[Hama]] are confronting them and banning them from entering neighborhoods.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/world/middleeast/04syria.html |title=Syria Sends In Tanks to Storm Center of Rebellious City |first=Nada |last=Bakri |first2=Rick |last2=Gladstone |newspaper=New York Times |date=3 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The water, electricity and all communications in [[Hama]] and its surrounding villages and towns had been cut off, according to nearby online posts on social networking sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;
The accounts could not be independently confirmed because the Syrian government banned foreign journalists from entering the country to report.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt; Shaam, an online video channel that is aligned to the protest movement, posted a video dated 3 August that showed at least one tank attacking a neighbourhood that the narrator said was Hayy al-Hader in Hama; heavy plumes of smoke could be seen rising in the sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;

On 3 August, following the attacks, workers in Hama declared three days of general strike in memory of those killed by security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jta59ZDMxfvBhPdfZUYR-SygjsnA?docId=CNG.2758b2fb780648c8d34ac969510e4d6a.b1 |title=AFP: Syria's Hama on strike after deadly unrest |publisher=Google.com |date=5 June 2011 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
