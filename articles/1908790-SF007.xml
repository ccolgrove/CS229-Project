'''Symphony OS''', '''SymphonyOne''' or '''Symphony Linux''', is a [[Live CD]] [[Linux]]-based [[operating system]], developed by [[Ryan Quinn]], [[Jason Spisak]], and [[Alexander Drummond]]. The distribution was dormant until 29 June 2011, when a new build was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://symphonyos.blogspot.com/2011/06/symphony-reborn.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, Symphony OS was based on [[Knoppix]]. Since its May 2006 release it is no longer based on Knoppix, but rather on [[Debian]] unstable, and features a functional hard drive installer. Symphony OS 2007 Preview, was based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 7.04.&lt;ref&gt;[http://symphonyos.com/cms/?p=15 Symphony OS 2007 Preview]&lt;/ref&gt;SymphonyOne was released on April 1, 2008. The release of version 2008.1 is based on Ubuntu 7.10.

The primary difference between Symphony OS and other distributions is the addition of the [[Mezzo (desktop environment)|Mezzo]] [[desktop environment]]. This environment, like other aspects of Symphony, was designed with an eye towards extreme simplicity and usability. An example is that [[WLAN]]-Networks can work automatically with no user action. Symphony also includes its own [[Mozilla Application Suite|Mozilla]]-driven application environment, called [[Symphony OS#Orchestra|Orchestra]].

Symphony OS uses a custom packaging system utilizing the &lt;tt&gt;*.sym&lt;/tt&gt; package format; through a simple GUI a user may install any application in the Symphony library without dealing with [[Dependency hell|&quot;dependency hell&quot;]]. Because Symphony is [[Debian]]-based, it also supports the [[Deb (file format)|Debian package format]].

==Orchestra==
'''Orchestra''' is an incomplete [[rapid application development]] environment which is being written for Symphony OS. It allows programs composed of [[HTML]] and [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]-style [[Perl]] to run as local [[GUI]] applications.

Orchestra is made up of two main parts: a lightweight [[localhost]]-only [[HTTP server]] written in [[Perl]], and a slimmed down [[Mozilla]] [[layout engine|renderer]]. Because Mozilla is used as the base for rendering Orchestra, applications can utilize the following technologies:
*Plain HTML
*[[JavaScript]]
*Perl and CGI
*[[Java applet]]s (using a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]])
*[[Macromedia Flash]] applications (using a plugin)
*Embedded media players (using a plugin)
*[[XUL]] interfaces

==Mezzo==
{{main|Mezzo (desktop environment)}}
'''Mezzo''' is the [[desktop environment]] created by Ryan Quinn based on designs by Jason Spisak. Added to Symphony OS, it aims to pose a new way of presenting data to the user. Mezzo disposes of standard concepts like ''&quot;The desktop is a folder&quot;'' and nested menu systems and instead presents all needed information directly to the user via the main desktop and four desk targets for tasks and files related to System, Programs, Files, and Trash. The developers claim that this makes the desktop easier to use. A new desktop environment called Conductor is under development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://symphonyos.com/viewtopic.php?id=13 Call it Conductor]&lt;/ref&gt;
