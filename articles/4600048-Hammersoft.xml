'''Castor Bay''' is a [[bay]] and [[suburb]] of [[Auckland]] in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. Located between [[Milford, New Zealand|Milford]] and [[Campbells Bay]] it forms part of [[Auckland]]'s [[East Coast Bays]]. To the east lies the islands of [[Rangitoto Island|Rangitoto]] and [[Motutapu Island|Motutapu]] which are easily visible from land. The suburb is in the North Shore ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of Auckland City.

The population was 2,877 in the [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|2006 Census]], an increase of 93 from 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{NZ Quickstats|3507710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bay itself is quite small and is well sheltered by an artificial [[Breakwater (structure)]] that extends from the northern edge of the bay, running towards the south. A small bark and grass area with several large [[PÅhutukawa]] trees offering shelter compliments the beachfront and an extended coastline stretches out to the north towards Campbells Bay. 

Nearby [[John F. Kennedy]] Park contains old [[World War II]] [[bunker]]s that were used to survey the [[Hauraki Gulf]] and is accessible from Castor Bay by road (Beach Road) or by walkway (from the extended coastline to the north). 
The northern headland of Castor Bay is the site of an old [[MÄori people|Maori]] Pa, Rahopara, that is believed to have been last inhabited and then abandoned in the 18th century, prior to European colonisation. Very little is known about the people who lived there but the tribe's ancient earth excavations are still visible.

[[Sam Hunt (poet)|Sam Hunt]], one of New Zealand's most well known poets was born in Castor Bay.

The local [[primary school]] is [[Campbells Bay Primary School]] located on Aberdeen Road, nearby the Pupuke Golf Course. It has a [[Socio-Economic Decile|decile rating]] of 10 and a roll of 662.&lt;ref&gt;{{TKI|1242|Campbells Bay School}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school opened in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Education Gazette New Zealand|title=Jubilees &amp; reunions - Campbells Bay School|volume=78|issue=11|date=5 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
