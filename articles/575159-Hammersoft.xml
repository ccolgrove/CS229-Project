'''Austin College''' is a [[private university|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] affiliated by covenant relationship with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] and located in [[Sherman, Texas]], about 60 miles (about 100&amp;nbsp;km) North of [[Dallas]].

The undergraduate student body of Austin College is limited to about 1,350. Most students are required to live on campus for the first three years in an attempt to create a close-knit community.  Austin College actively promotes various [[study abroad]] programs; 70% of students study abroad during their four years at the college. The college states that it attempts to foster close interaction between students and professors via a 13:1 student to faculty ratio and an average class size of fewer than 25 students. The college has no teaching assistants, so regular faculty teach all levels of coursework.

Chartered in November 1849, it is the oldest college in Texas under original charter and name as recognized by the [[Texas Historical Commission|State Historical Survey Committee]].

==History==
The college was founded on October 13, 1849 in [[Huntsville, Texas]] by [[Princeton University|Princeton]]-educated missionary Dr. Daniel Baker.

The college moved to Sherman in 1876 and became co-educational in 1918, merging in 1930 with the all female [[Texas Presbyterian College]].

Baker named the school after Texas historical figure [[Stephen F. Austin]].  Another important figure in Texas history, [[Sam Houston]], served on the original board of trustees for the school, and the former site in Huntsville later became today's [[Sam Houston State University]].

On September 20, 1973, musician [[Jim Croce]] died in a [[plane crash]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]] on his way to perform the next night at Austin College. Six people perished in the crash.

==Administration==
Dr. Marjorie Hass became the 15th president of Austin College on July 1, 2009. She previously served as provost of [[Muhlenberg College]]. Dr. Hass succeeded Dr. Oscar Page.

==Rankings==
Listed in the ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' &quot;Guide to the 331 Most Interesting Colleges&quot;. Austin College is also ninth on the ''U.S. News'' 2006 list of &quot;most students studying abroad.&quot; It is a member of the International 50, a group of the top colleges in the nation for international focus.

==Academics==
Austin College offers about 35 majors and pre-professional programs for study, and students can also create a specialized major to match their academic interests. The college is known for its nationally recognized five-year Master of Arts in Teaching program, its pre-medical, international studies, and pre-law programs, which draw many students to the campus. The school also has a [http://www.austincollegemusic.com music program], and is home to the Austin College A Cappella Choir and the [http://www.shermansymphony.com Sherman Symphony Orchestra] made up of students and local musicians, and assorted smaller musical ensembles. It also sponsors the [[Austin College#Posey Leadership Institute|Posey Center of Excellence in Leadership]], the Center for Environmental Studies[http://www.austincollege.edu/Category.asp?1450], and the Center for Southwestern and Mexican Studies [http://www.austincollege.edu/Category.asp?1968], three specialized programs that give students numerous research and internship opportunities. The school also has active programs in over 40 academic disciplines. The school's student newspaper, the Austin College ''Observer'', is a bi-weekly publication.

===Communication/Inquiry===
Communication/Inquiry is a seminar course taken by freshmen during the fall of their entry year. The professor becomes a mentor for the students in the class over the next four years. C/I serves as the initial course in the undergraduate core curriculum, meant to emphasize the enhancement of core academic skills. Course topics are generally aligned with specialty of the instructors. C/I professors and topics rotate every year.[http://www.austincollege.edu/Info.asp?2332]

===Heritage of Western Culture===
Heritage of Western Culture, a 3 semester program, was the Austin College core curriculum. Starting in the Fall of 2007, &quot;Heritage&quot; ceased to exist.  The purpose of the Heritage classes was to tie together various liberal arts disciplines into an overview of the development of western culture.

===January Term===
January Term is a three-week course taught every January. Students are required to take three Jan-terms during their time at AC, and many use the semester to either take a class in a different area than their regular studies, intensify their study in their designated field, or travel abroad on one of the many travel Jan-terms. Off-campus Jan-terms are an opportunity for those who cannot study abroad during the normal school year to do so. International destinations rotate from year to year. There are also a number of domestic travel locations, such as [[Ghost Ranch]] in [[New Mexico]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], and [[New York City]].

Courses are taught on-campus as well. A longstanding policy requires freshmen to spend their first Jan-term on-campus, although some instructors allow exceptions.

===Jordan Family Language House===
Completed in 1998, the Jordan Family Language House is both a residence hall and a place of study for German, Spanish, French, Chinese and Japanese language and culture. The hall is divided into four sections, one for each language. Each section functions independently, with the number of students varying from Spanish (the largest) to Japanese (the smallest, with a capacity for eight). Students are encouraged to speak in their language of study when in the house.

A native speaker, always coming from abroad, resides in each section to assist students in their study of the language. The native speaker also holds intermediate and advanced conversation classes for the students. The Jordan House contains a multimedia language laboratory.

Students who live in the house are enrolled in a half-credit course, in addition to another course in the language or literature.  Course requirements include meeting several times a week for language table, weekly house meetings with skits, games, and other presentations in the target language, and a variety of other culturally appropriate activities.

The purpose of the program is to gain skills in leadership, verbal and written communication, teamwork, decision-making, and research. At the National Model U.N. Conference in [[New York City]], the AC program has earned more than 20 top rankings for Outstanding Delegation.

Austin College athletes do not receive athletic scholarships and take pride for being true scholar athletes.  The football team became known as the &quot;Kangaroos&quot; sometime during the 1914 to 1915 seasons.   According to campus legend, the mascot name was derived from a kangaroo court of organized students that would paddle violators of school rules.
