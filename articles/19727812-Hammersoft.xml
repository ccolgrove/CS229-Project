&quot;'''Lady What's Tomorrow'''&quot; is a song by [[Elton John]] with lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]]. It is the fifth and opening track of side two off his first album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''.

It is one of the songwriting duo's earliest, with demos surfacing from as early as [[1967 in music|1967]].

==Musical structure==
Following rather alternative songs, this is a simple pop/rock-song typical of the later John. A sole piano opens the song, which keeps a steady 4/4 beat. This is also John's first collaboration with drummer [[Nigel Olsson]], who takes over Roger Pope's chores on this track. An acoustic guitar with a [[Country music|country]]-esque feel is also featured. Nigel would join Elton's band as drummer on and off to this day.

It is the shortest song on the album.

==Lyrical meaning==
The song laments the destruction of rural England to make way for construction (hence &quot;sorry, but it's over - now there's no concrete and no clover...we would run into the woods, but we never will again). The song was written in 1967, in the heyday of the [[Overspill estate|London overspill]], and [[New Towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] such as [[Stevenage]] and [[Milton Keynes]] were being constructed almost from scratch to cope with this.

==Performances==
It was never performed live in concert. It was however performed in John's first solo radio appearance on November 27, 1968. Since then it hasn't been performed in any format.

==Personnel==
*Elton John - [[piano]], [[Organ (music)|organ]], vocals
*[[Caleb Quaye]] - [[Acoustic guitar|guitar]]
*Tony Murray - [[Bass guitar|bass]]
*[[Nigel Olsson]] - [[Drum kit|drums]] (incorrectly credited as &quot;Nigel Olsen&quot;)
