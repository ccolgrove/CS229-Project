'''Pu Songling''' ({{zh|t=è²æ¾é½¡|s=è²æ¾é¾|p=PÃº SÅnglÃ­ng|w='''P'u Sung-ling'''}}, June 5, 1640âFebruary 25, 1715) was a [[Qing Dynasty]] [[Chinese people|Chinese]] writer, best known as the author of ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]''.

==Biography==
Pu was born into a poor landlord-merchant family from [[Zichuan District|Zichuan]] (æ·å·, now [[Zibo|Zibo, Shandong]]). At the age of nineteen, he received the gongsheng degree in the [[Chinese examination system|civil service examination]], but it was not until he was seventy-one that he received the xiucai degree. 

He spent most of his life working as a private tutor, and collecting the stories that were later published in ''[[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]]''. Some critics attribute the [[Vernacular Chinese]] novel ''[[Xingshi Yinyuan Zhuan]]'' to him.
