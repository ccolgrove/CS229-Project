The '''troland''' (symbol '''Td'''), named after [[Leonard T. Troland]], is a unit of ''conventional retinal illuminance''.  It is meant as a method for correcting [[photometry (optics)|photometric]] measurements of [[luminance]] values impinging on the [[human eye]] by scaling them by the effective [[pupil]] size.

The troland typically refers to the ordinary or [[photopic]] troland, which is defined in terms of the photopic luminance:
:''T'' = ''L''&amp;middot;''p''
where ''L'' is the photopic luminance in [[candela|cd]]/[[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] and ''p'' is pupil area in mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

A [[scotopic]] troland is also sometimes defined:
:''T&amp;prime;'' = ''L&amp;prime;''&amp;middot;''p''
