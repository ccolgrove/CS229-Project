'''BackTrack''' is an [[operating system]] based on the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Linux distribution|GNU/Linux distribution]] aimed at [[digital forensics]] and [[penetration test]]ing use.&lt;ref&gt;Remote-Exploit Homepage http://www.remote-exploit.org/backtrack.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after [[backtracking]], a search algorithm.  The current version is BackTrack 5, code name &quot;Revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/backtrack/backtrack-5-release/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The BackTrack distribution originated from the merger of two formerly competing distributions which focused on [[penetration test]]ing:

* ''WHAX'': a [[Slax]] based Linux distribution developed by Mati Aharoni, a security consultant. Earlier versions of WHAX were called ''Whoppix''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remote-exploit.org/?page_id=160&lt;/ref&gt; and were based on [[Knoppix]].
* ''Auditor Security Collection'': a [[Live CD]] based on [[Knoppix]] developed by Max Moser which included over 300 tools organized in a user-friendly hierarchy.

The overlap with Auditor and WHAX in purpose and tools collection partly led to the merger.

== Tools ==
BackTrack provides users with easy access to a comprehensive and large collection of security-related tools ranging from port scanners to password crackers. Support for [[Live CD]] and [[Live USB]] functionality allows users to boot BackTrack directly from portable media without requiring installation, though permanent installation to hard disk is also an option.

BackTrack includes many well known security tools including:

* [[Metasploit Project|Metasploit]] integration (Non-Working &lt;ref&gt;http://xylos.wikidot.com/howto-linux-bt4guide&lt;/ref&gt; and Officially Unsupported &lt;ref&gt;http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/beginners-forum/38681-metasploit-lorcon2.html&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Monitor mode|RFMON]] Injection capable wireless drivers
* [[Aircrack-NG]]
* [[Kismet (software)|Kismet]]
* [[Nmap]]
* [[Ophcrack]]
* [[Ettercap (computing)|Ettercap]]
* [[Wireshark]] (formerly known as Ethereal)
* [[BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)]]
* [[Hydra (software)|Hydra]]
* [[OWASP Mantra Security Framework]] collection of hacking tools, add-ons and scripts based on Firefox
* Cisco OCS Mass Scanner A very reliable and fast scanner for Cisco routers with telnet/enable default password.
* [[Quypt (Terminal Emulator)]] (which is private software by Crimson Hacking group, which has leaked to the Mainstream) Blackhat
* A large collection of [[Exploit (computer security)|exploits]] as well as more commonplace software such as [[Web browser|browsers]].

BackTrack arranges tools into 12 categories:

*Information Gathering
*Vulnerability Assessment
*Exploitation Tools
*Privilege Escalation
*Maintaining Access
*Reverse Engineering
*RFID Tools
*Stress testing
*Forensics
*Reporting Tools
*Services
*Miscellaneous
