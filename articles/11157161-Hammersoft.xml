==Regular season==
===Eric Dickerson===
In his second season, Dickerson continued his onslaught of the NFL record book. As a rookie, Dickerson established rookie records for most rushing attempts (390), most rushing yards gained (1,808) and most touchdowns rushing (18), including another two receiving touchdowns.&lt;ref name=&quot;ericdickerson29.com&quot;&gt;Eric's Days as a Ram, http://www.ericdickerson29.com/rams.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts earned him All-Pro, [[Pro Bowl]], Player of the Year and [[NFL Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] honors.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Dickerson: Pro Football  Hall of Fame, http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/member.jsp?PLAYER_ID=55&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven times during the 1984 season, he gained more than 100 yards rushing, breaking the record of 100-yard games in a season held by [[O.J. Simpson]]. His 2,105 total yards rushing in the 1984 NFL season beat Simpsonâs 1973 NFL season record of 2,003 yards rushing in a single season. To date, no one has rushed for more yards in a single [[NFL]] season. However, Simpson's career high rushing total came in a 14 game season, whereas Dickerson's mark was set during a 16-game season.&lt;ref name=&quot;ericdickerson29.com&quot;/&gt; Dickerson broke OJ's record with a 215-yard performance in a 27-16 Rams win over the [[Houston Oilers]], Week 15 of the season.
