'''Alcohol 120%''' is an [[Optical disc authoring software|optical disc authoring program]] and [[disk image emulator]] created by [http://www.alcohol-soft.com Alcohol Soft]. 

Alcohol 120% can also mount disc images, with support for their proprietary Media Descriptor Image ([[.mds]]/.mdf) disc image format. It is capable of converting image files to the [[ISO image|ISO format]]. Alcohol Soft has cited it will not be developing an image editor for Alcohol 120%.

The latest versions of Alcohol 120% contain the A.C.I.D. wizard. A.C.I.D., or &quot;Alcohol Cloaking Initiative for DRM&quot; (based originally on the [[Yet Another Securom Utility|Y.A.S.U.]] application), operates as an &quot;SCSI-drive protector&quot; which hides emulated drives from [[SecuROM]] 7 and [[SafeDisc]] 4.

==Supported File Types==
The file formats supported by Alcohol 120%'s image mounting feature are listed in the table on the right.

Alcohol 120%'s image making tool supports the following formats:
*[[.mds]]/.mdf (default)
*[[.iso]]
*[[.ccd]]/[[.img]]/[[CloneCD|.sub]]
*[[.cue]]/[[.bin]]
**Note: When making disk images of DVDs, Alcohol 120% only supports the .mdf/.mds or .iso format.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Copy protection==
Alcohol 120%'s image recording feature is capable of bypassing certain [[copy protection]] schemes, such as [[SafeDisc]], [[SecuROM]], and [[Data Position Measurement]] (DPM). Although, certain copy protection schemes require burner hardware that is capable of passing along the copy protection. It can also create images of [[PlayStation]] and [[PlayStation 2]] file systems. It lacks the ability to back up DVD titles encrypted with the [[Content Scramble System]]. Due to legal restrictions, Alcohol Soft has opted not to include this feature.

Some software manufacturers employ [[software blacklist]] methods to prevent Alcohol 120% from copying the software. There are [[Third-party software component|third party]] tools available that attempt to counteract the blacklist methods, such as Anti-blaxx and CureROM. These two programs have been replaced by A.C.I.D.

==Alcohol 52%==
'''Alcohol 52%''' is a version of Alcohol 120% without the burning engine. It can still create image files, and mount those images on up to 31 virtual drives. There are two versions of Alcohol 52%, free and 30-day trial. The free version contains an optional [[adware]] toolbar bundled and is limited to 6 virtual drives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.free-downloads.net/programs/Alcohol_52__Free_Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
