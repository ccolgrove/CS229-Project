She appeared in villain roles in the remakes of ''[[Kung Aagawin Mo Ang Lahat Sa Akin]]'' and ''[[Stairway to Heaven (TV series)|Stairway to Heaven]]'', and on the musical series ''[[Diva (Philippine TV series)|Diva]]'' before finally achieving leading lady status in the fantasy series ''[[Grazilda]]'' in 2010. In addition to her television appearances, she has also acted in a number of mainstream and independent films, including ''[[Sukob]]'', ''Batanes'', and ''Still Life''.

As a singer, de Castro has so far released two albums: ''Magbalik Ka'', released in 2001, and the self-titled ''Glaiza'', released in 2006.

==Acting career==
===Early career: minor roles on television and in movies (2002-2006)===
de Castro began her career with [[GMA-7]] playing a minor role in the soap opera ''[[Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin]]''. However, after only a few months with the company, she transferred to rival network [[ABS-CBN]] and became a contracted artist of [[Star Magic]], the company's training ground for young talent. During her time in ABS-CBN, she continued to play both supporting and minor roles, two of the most prominent being the role of Halley in the teen-oriented show, ''[[Berks (TV series)|Berks]]'' and the role of Pinky in the teen-horror series, ''[[Spirits (TV series)|Spirits]]''.

Between 2002 and 2005, she would only appear in films sporadically, playing [[bit part]]s in movies such as ''Singsing ni Lola'' (2002) and ''Miss Pinoy'' (2005). By 2006, she began to appear in films more frequently, with minor parts in the horror films ''[[Sukob]]'' and ''[[White Lady (film)|White Lady]]'', as well as the [[Manny Pacquiao]] [[biopic]], ''[[Pacquiao: The Movie]]''. Her most prominent film role during this point in her career was as a minor antagonist in the film adaptation of [[Carlo Vergara]]'s [[graphic novel]], ''[[Zsazsa Zaturnnah]]''; the film was an entry to the 2006 [[Metro Manila Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PEP.ph&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pep.ph/news/11763/Glaiza-de-Castro-sees-Asian-Treasures-as-her-chance-to-be-known-not-as-Angel-Locsin|title=

===Return to GMA and breakout roles (2006-2008)===
After four years with ABS-CBN, de Castro returned to its rival [[GMA Network]] in 2006. One of her first roles back was as Honey on the [[Fantaserye and telefantasya|fantasy-adventure]] series, ''[[Fantastikids]]'', where she starred alongside Marky Cielo, [[Jackie Rice]] and [[Ryza Cenon]], as well as former child star [[Paolo Contis]] and former [[beauty queen]] [[Melanie Marquez]]. The reception to the show was mostly warm; journalist Paul Daza of ''[[The Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' compared it favorably to its counterpart on ABS-CBN (fantasy-drama [[anthology series|anthology]] ''[[Komiks (TV series)|Komiks]]''), and commented that, based on ratings, &quot;it would seem like the new [GMA-7] stars are outshining the more established [ABS-CBN] performers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=2370|title=

2007 also saw her featured prominently in the [[independent film]] ''Still Life'', a film written and directed by Katski Flores, about an artist stricken with a [[terminal illness]] who has traveled to an isolated island to paint his last work. In the film, de Castro plays Emma, a woman who relates her past to the main character. Her portrayal of Emma was noted by film critic Tito Valiente of ''Business Mirror'' as &quot;one reason the short life on that island becomes very real.&quot; Valiente went on to note that de Castro's character was &quot;vulnerable but not whiny. Even in tears she conjures an image of a woman whose only way out of life is finding life in anything.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Business Mirror.&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/10162007/life03.html |title=

===2009-present===
After another supporting role in the television adaptation of comic-book writer [[Carlo J. Caparas]]' graphic novel ''[[Gagambino]]'', de Castro once again landed a lead role on another television adaptation of a Filipino film, ''[[Kung Aagawin Mo Ang Lahat Sa Akin]]'' opposite [[Patrick Garcia]], [[Maxene Magalona]], [[Jackie Rice]] and [[JC Tiuseco]]. In the series she played the primary antagonist, Gladys Andrada (a role originated by co-star [[Jackie Lou Blanco]]), the jealous, only biological child of Gilbert (played by [[Nonie Buencamino]]) and Clara Andrada (played by Blanco). Her portrayal was well-received; columnist Jason John Lim commented that while she knew she was breaking out of her comfort zone, &quot;What she didn't know that she would also begin breaking the expectations of everybody.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GMA News.tv&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www8.gmanews.tv/story/170657/igma-glaiza-de-castro-gets-reborn-on-stairway-to-heaven |title=

Right after ''[[Kung Aagawin Mo Ang Lahat Sa Akin]]'', she played another supporting role on an episode of the drama anthology [[SRO Cinemaserye]], which chronicled the life story of singer [[Eva Castillo]] (portrayed in this episode by [[Manilyn Reynes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/213362/the-eva-castillo-story-continues-tonight|title='The Eva Castillo Story' continues tonight|author=Crispina Martinez Belen|publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=July 29, 2009|accessdate=December 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, she landed another role as the primary antagonist in the Philippine remake of the widely-popular [[Korean wave|Korean]] television drama, ''[[Stairway to Heaven (TV series)|Stairway to Heaven]]'', alongside [[Dingdong Dantes]], [[Rhian Ramos]] and [[TJ Trinidad]]. She portrayed Eunice Manansala (serving as the counterpart for Han Yoori, played by actress [[Kim Tae-hee]]), the envious stepsister of Jodi Reyes (played by Rhian Ramos). To prepare for the role, de Castro watched the original series in order to attempt to get an idea of who her character was as a person.&lt;ref name=&quot;GMA News.tv&quot;/&gt; de Castro also commented on the relative complexity of her character in this series compared to her character in ''Kung Aagawin Mo Ang Lahat Sa Akin'': &quot;Unlike my previous role, you donât know what is going on inside the mind of Eunice. What's going inside her head is really devious. She is subtle in her approach and very scheming... Despite being evil, she still has a heart and there's a reason she became a bad person. If she is stepping down on people, she is also being stepped on by other people. She also has to fulfill her needs and wants and she will do everything for the person she loves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MB.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/221714/glaiza-de-ca|title=

In light of the show's success, de Castro's manager, Manny Valera, has decided to turn down any further villain roles on behalf of his talent in order to build her up as a lead star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manny&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journal.com.ph/index.php/showbiz-tsismis/19537-richard-denies-leaks-in-survivor.html|title=Richard denies leaks in &quot;Survivor&quot;|author=Mario E. Bautista|publisher=Journal Online|date=October 3, 2010|accessdate=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30, it was announced that de Castro would no longer be cast in the remake of the film ''Temptation Island'' and would instead be launched as a lead star in the 2011 remake of the 1992 film ''Aswang'', produced by [[Regal Films]] with film director [[Topel Lee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=625543&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=96|title=Aktor kailangang dalas-dalasan ang labas ng bahay!|author=Nitz Miralles|publisher=Pilipino Star Ngayon|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
De Castro has so far released two albums. The first one, titled ''Magbalik Ka'', was released under XAX Music Entertainment, in 2001, when she was thirteen. Five years later, she released a second album, the self-entitled ''Glaiza'', this time released under Dyna Records. The latter album, described by de Castro herself as &quot;more defined&quot; compared to her first album, comprises [[Pop music|pop]] and [[R&amp;B]] songs, and contains mostly original content except for two songs: a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] version of [[Joey Albert]]'s song &quot;How Can I Make You See&quot; (titled &quot;Paano&quot; in the album), and an [[English language|English]] version of [[Dingdong Avanzado]]'s &quot;Basta't Kasama Kita&quot;. When asked why it took her half a decade to release a second album, de Castro explained that after the first album was completed, she did not renew her contract with the record company and instead focused on her television career.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mas defined ngayon.&quot; ... &quot;After the first, hindi na kami nag-renew [ng contract]. Hindi na rin ako nagwo-work. Nagka-manager na din ako. Nagconcentrate sa TV shows. Puro TV ginagawa ko.&quot; {{cite web |url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/214/Glaiza-de-Castro-releases-self-titled-album |title=

==Personal life==

She also maintained a close friendship with consistent on-screen partner Marky Cielo for a significant part of the latter's career until his death in 2008. In the wake of her friend's death, de Castro recounted an exchange she had the day before Cielo died: she told Cielo about a dream she had about him and Rich Asuncion; according to her, Cielo had had other people tell him they had dreams about him, which he took to be an omen of death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philippine Entertainment Portal&quot;&gt;&quot;Ang panaginip ko, silang dalawa ni Rich [Asuncion, StarStruck 4 First Princess] parang tinutukso-tukso ko, magkasama sila sa kotse.&quot; ... &quot;Tapos, ang text back sa akin ni Marky, marami raw siyang naririnig na napapaginipan din siya. Ang sabi niya, 'Bakit kaya maraming nagsasabing napaginipan nila ako, mamamatay na kaya ako?' Na talagang ngayon ko lang naalala yung sinabi niyang yun, kaya kinilabutan ako!&quot; {{tl icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.pep.ph/news/20162/Glaiza-de-Castro-had-a-dream-about-Marky-Cielo-before-he-passed-away |title=

Despite gaining wider recognition for her roles as a villain in ''Kung Aagawin Mo Ang Lahat Sa Akin'' and ''Stairway to Heaven'', de Castro has reportedly had qualms about portraying a villain again in future projects. Of this, she commented, &quot;I don't want to be [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as an antagonist forever because it's difficult to get rid of that sort of image.&quot; However, she has expressed preference for antagonist roles over &quot;sexy&quot; roles.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ayokong ma-typecast na kontrabida forever kasi mahirap makakawala sa ganoong image.&quot;{{cite web |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/220026/i-ll-say-no-next-villainess-role-glaiza-de-castro|title=

Although she had, in the past, considered posing for magazines such as [[FHM]] &quot;for instant fame and fortune&quot;, she eventually decided against it and opted to hone her craft as a serious actress, saying, &quot;I just want to start on the right foot by focusing more on acting than diverting my attention to other interests. I want to become an actress and to show what I can do.&quot; She has also expressed interest in playing &quot;out-of-the-box and extreme roles&quot;, in the vein of [[Natalie Portman]] in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and [[Charlize Theron]] in ''[[Monster (2003 film)|Monster]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philstar.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=30748 |title=
Glaiza off to a good start |author=Jerry Donato|accessdate=November 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, she spoke of her preference for independent film, commenting in Taglish, &quot;As for me, I feel fulfilled in indie films. I'm given roles in indie projects that are heavier compared to the [[mainstream]]. And I'm rarely offered roles in mainstream [films] anyway.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ang sa akin lang, fulfilled ako sa indie films. Nabibigyan ako ng roles sa indie projects na mabigat kung ikukumpara sa mainstream. At saka madalang naman akong mabigyan ng offer sa mainstream.&quot;{{cite web |url=http://cerphin.net/balita/Glaiza-de-Castro-feels-fulfilled-in-doing-indie-films/source/14530/|title=
