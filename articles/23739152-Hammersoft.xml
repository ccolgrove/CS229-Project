The '''Goonyella railway system''' is located in Central Queensland, and services the coal mining area of the [[Bowen Basin]]. It carries coal to the [[Hay Point]] Coal Terminal, and Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal, as well as products to other destinations by way of connections to the [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|North Coast Line]] at Yukan and the Central Line via Gregory to Burngrove.

The Goonyella system is [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] 1,067&amp;nbsp;mm (3&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in) and electrified using [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV 50Hz]].

The Goonyella Coal Chain services 24 mines, carrying coal from BHP Billiton Mitsubishi Alliance, Anglo Coal, Macarthur Coal, Peabody Energy Australia, Xstrata and ANCI. The system currently operates under a demand-pull model, with rail haulages being designated by the ports, and the shipping stem.
