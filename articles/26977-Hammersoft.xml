The '''Leland Stanford Junior University''', commonly referred to as '''Stanford University''' or '''Stanford''', is a [[Private university|private research university]] on an {{convert|8180|acre|ha|sing=on}} campus located near [[Palo Alto, California]]. It is situated in the northwestern [[Santa Clara Valley]] on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} northwest of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] and {{convert|37|mi|km|0|sp=us}} southeast of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford_tours&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admission.stanford.edu/place/tours.html |title=Virtual Tours : Stanford University |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford is widely considered one of the most prestigious and selective universities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/9109/harvard-number-one-university-eyes-public.aspx Best Universities In The Eyes of the Public]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leland Stanford]], a Californian railroad tycoon and politician, founded the university in 1891 in honor of his son, [[Leland Stanford, Jr.|Leland Stanford,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], who died of [[typhoid]] two months before his 16th birthday. The university was established as a coeducational and nondenominational institution, but struggled financially after the senior Stanford's 1893 death and after much of the campus was damaged by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]. Following [[World War II]], Provost [[Frederick Terman]] supported faculty and graduates' entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would become known as [[Silicon Valley]]. By 1970, Stanford was home to a [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|linear accelerator]], was one of the original four [[ARPANET]] nodes, and had transformed itself into a major research university in [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[natural sciences]], and [[social sciences]]. More than 50 Stanford faculty, staff, and alumni have won the [[Nobel Prize]] and Stanford has the largest number of [[Turing award]] winners for a single institution. Stanford faculty and alumni have founded many prominent technology companies including [[Cisco Systems]], [[Google]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Netscape Communications]], [[Rambus]], [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Varian Associates]], and [[Yahoo!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What MIT Learned from Stanford |author=Eric W.

The university is organized into seven schools including academic schools of [[Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences|Humanities and Sciences]] and [[Stanford University School of Earth Sciences|Earth Sciences]] as well as professional schools of [[Stanford University School of Business|Business]], [[Stanford University School of Education|Education]], [[Stanford University School of Engineering|Engineering]], [[Stanford Law School|Law]], and [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Medicine]]. Stanford has a student body of approximately 6,900 undergraduate&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford_facts_2010&quot; /&gt; and 8,400 graduate students.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford_facts_2010&quot; /&gt; Stanford is a founding member of the [[Association of American Universities]] and in 2010 managed US$1.15 billion in research funding and $13.8 billion in endowment support, with $21.4 billion in consolidated net assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/about/facts/research.html |title=AboutâResearch |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford competes in 34 varsity sports and is one of two private universities in the [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] [[Pacific-12 Conference]]. Stanford's athletic program has won the [[NACDA Directors' Cup]] every year since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-06-22-stanford-directors-cup_N.htm|title=Stanford locks up Directors' Cup award for 16th consecutive season|work=[[USA Today]]|author=Eddie Timanus|date=June 22, 2010|authorlink=Eddie Timanus}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], Stanford athletes won 25 medals, including eight gold medals, more than any other university in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/uga/student/athletics/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
Stanford was founded by [[Leland Stanford]], a [[railroad]] magnate, [[United States Senator]], and former [[Governor of California|California Governor]], and his wife, [[Jane Stanford]]. It is named in honor of their only child, [[Leland Stanford, Jr.]], who died in 1884 just before his 16th birthday. His parents decided to dedicate a university to their only son, and Leland Stanford told his wife, &quot;The children of California shall be our children.&quot;

[[File:Leland Stanford p1070023.jpg|thumb|right|Leland Stanford, the university's founder, as painted by [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier]] in 1881 and now on display at the [[Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts|Cantor Center]]]]
The Stanfords visited Harvard's president, [[Charles William Eliot|Charles Eliot]], and asked how much it would cost to duplicate Harvard in [[California]]. Eliot replied that he supposed $15 million {{Clarify| reason=Cost in 1884 dollars or modern| date=November 2011}} would be enough. [[David Starr Jordan]], the president of [[Indiana University]], was their eventual choice to direct Stanford, after several leaders of the Ivy League turned them down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=Americans and the California Dream|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1973|pages=314â315|chapter=Life Among the Best and Truest: David Starr Jordan and the Founding of Stanford University |isbn=0-19-501644-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Locals and members of the university community are known to refer to the school as '''The Farm''', a nod to the fact that the university is located on the former site of Leland Stanford's horse farm.

The motto of Stanford University, selected by President Jordan, is &quot;''Die Luft der Freiheit weht.''&quot; Translated from the German, this quotation from [[Ulrich von Hutten]] means, &quot;The wind of freedom blows.&quot;  The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The university's founding Grant of Endowment from the Stanfords came in November 1885.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wasc.stanford.edu/files/FoundingGrant.pdf The Founding Grant] The Founding Grant with
Amendments, Legislation,
and Court Decrees&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/lelandstanfordju00stanrich The Leland Stanford, Junior, University.] The Act of the Legislature of California. The Grant of Endowment.  Address of Leland Stanford to the Trustees.  Minutes of the First Meeting of Board of Trustees.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides defining the operational structure of the university, it made several specific stipulations:
&quot;The Trustees ... shall have the power and it shall be their duty:
*To establish and maintain at such University an educational system, which will, if followed, fit the graduate for some useful pursuit, and to this end to cause the pupils, as easily as may be, to declare the particular calling, which, in life, they may desire to pursue;  ...
*To prohibit sectarian instruction, but to have taught in the University the immortality of the soul, the existence of an all-wise and benevolent Creator, and that obedience to His laws is the highest duty of man.
*To have taught in the University the right and advantages of association and co-operation.
*To afford equal facilities and give equal advantages in the University to both sexes.
*To maintain on the Palo Alto estate a farm for instruction in agriculture in all its branches.&quot;

The original &quot;inner quad&quot; buildings (1887â91) were designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], [[Francis A. Walker]], [[Charles Allerton Coolidge]], and Leland Stanford himself.  After six years of planning and building, the university officially opened on October 1, 1891, to 559 students and 15 faculty members, seven of them from Cornell.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;[http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1097125200 Cornell/Stanford Connection]&lt;/ref&gt; Tuition was free until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/home/stanford/history/leader.html |title=History : Stanford University |publisher=Stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herbert Hoover]] and his future wife Lou Hoover were in the first class; the Hoovers maintained close lifetime ties to the school.

====Coeducation====
The school was established as a [[coeducation]]al institution. However, Jane Stanford soon put a policy in place limiting female enrollment to 500 students because of the large number of women students enrolling. She did not want the school to become &quot;the [[Vassar College|Vassar]] of the West&quot; because she felt that would not be an appropriate memorial for her son. In 1933 the policy was modified to specify an undergraduate male:female ratio of 3:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godeke.org/News/SigmaRho_Chapter.htm The Stanford Daily, November 12, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Stanford ratio&quot; of 3:1 remained in place until the early 1960s. By the late 1960s the &quot;ratio&quot; was about 2:1 for undergraduates, but much more skewed at the graduate level, except in the humanities. As of 2005, undergraduate enrollment is split nearly evenly between the sexes, but males outnumber females about 2:1 at the graduate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Undergraduate Program: Stanford University|url=http://stanford.edu/about/facts/undergraduate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Program: Stanford University|url = http://stanford.edu/about/facts/graduate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early finances====
When Senator Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy. A $15 million government lawsuit against Senator Stanford's estate, combined with the [[Panic of 1893]], made it extremely difficult to meet expenses. Most of the Board of Trustees advised a temporary closing until finances could be sorted out. However, Jane Stanford insisted that the university remain in operation. Faced with the possibility of financial ruin for the University she took charge of financial, administrative, and development matters at the university 1893-1905; from her experience as a mother and housewife, she ran the institution as a household. For the next several years, she paid salaries out of her personal resources, even pawning her jewelry to keep the university going. When the lawsuit was finally dropped in 1895, a university holiday was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Stanford: The Story of a University | author=Mirrielees, Edith R. | year=1959 | publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons | lccn=59-13788 | pages=82â91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nilan | first1 = Roxanne | year = 1979 | title = Jane Lathrop Stanford and the Domestication of Stanford University, 1893-1905 | url = | journal = San Jose Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 7â30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford alumnus [[George E. Crothers]] became a close adviser to Jane Stanford following his graduation from Stanford's law school in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Osborne | first=George E. | url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stflr10&amp;div=12&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals | title=Judge George Edward Crothers, 1870â1957 | journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] | volume=10 | issue=1 | year=December 1957 | pages=1â3 | accessdate=July 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Working with his brother Thomas (also a Stanford graduate and a lawyer), Crothers identified and corrected numerous major legal defects in the terms of the university's founding grant and successfully [[Lobbying|lobbied]] for an amendment to the [[California Constitution|California state constitution]] granting Stanford an exemption from taxation on its educational propertyâa change which allowed Jane Stanford to donate her [[stock]] holdings to the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Stanford's Judge Crothers: The Life Story of George E. Crothers | author=Clausen, Henry C. | publisher=The George E. Crothers Trust | year=1967 | lccn=67-17964 | pages=41â56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Alsworth Ross]] gained fame as a founding father of American sociology; in 1900 Jane Stanford fired him for radicalism and racism, unleashing a major academic freedom case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mohr | first1 = James C. | year = 1970 | title = Academic Turmoil and Public Opinion: the Ross Case at Stanford | url = | journal = Pacific Historical Review | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 39â61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jane Stanford's actions were sometimes eccentric. In 1897, she directed the board of trustees &quot;that the students be taught that everyone born on earth has a soul germ, and that on its development depends much in life here and everything in Life Eternal&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=Americans and the California Dream|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1973|page=329|chapter=Life Among the Best and Truest: David Starr Jordan and the Founding of Stanford University |isbn=0-19-501644-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She forbade students from sketching nude models in life-drawing class, banned automobiles from campus, and did not allow a hospital to be constructed so that people would not form an impression that Stanford was unhealthy. Between 1899 and 1905, she spent $3 million on a grand construction scheme building lavish memorials to the Stanford family, while university faculty and self-supporting students were living in poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr1&quot; /&gt;

===20th century===
[[Image:StanfordLibrary-1906.jpg|thumb|left|The ruins of Stanford Library after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]]]
The [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] destroyed parts of the Main Quad (including the original iteration of [[Stanford Memorial Church|Memorial Church]]) as well as the gate that first marked the entrance of the school; rebuilding on a somewhat less grandiose scale began immediately.

====Football====
From 1906 to 1919, in response to the crisis caused by numerous injuries, intercollegiate football was in jeopardy. While some colleges dropped football entirely, a few, such as the University of California and Stanford University, replaced it with English rugby. From 1906 to 1914, the two schools played rugby as their major sport, but they soon found that the objectionable practices they saw in football were introduced into rugby. Finally, when the football rules were changed, a move developed to return to football, reviving intercollegiate sports and enabling students and alumni to identify with football, an American sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parkm | first1 = Roberta J. | year = 1984 | title = From Football to Rugbyâand Back, 1906-1919: the University of California-Stanford University Response to the 'Football Crisis of 1905' | url = | journal = Journal of Sport History | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 5â40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hoover Institution====
The [[Hoover Institution]] (full name: the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace) at Stanford was set up by [[Herbert C. Hoover]], one of Stanford's first graduates. He had been in charge of American relief efforts in Europe after World War I before his election as president of the United States in 1928. Hoover's express purpose was to collect the records of contemporary history as it was happening. Hoover's helpers frequently risked their lives to rescue documentary and rare printed material, especially from countries under Nazi or Communist rule. Their many successes included the papers of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], the Goebbels diaries, and the records of the Russian secret police in Paris. Research institutes were also set up under Hoover's influence, though inevitably there were to be clashes between the moving force, Hoover, and the host university. In 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. Despite student unrest in the 1960s, the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanford. In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably. The Institute increasingly became a conservative think tank, with ties to Washington, especially since 1980.  It continues as an integral component of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duignan | first1 = Peter | year = 2001 | title = The Library of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace.

Part 2: the Campbell Years | url = | journal = Library History | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 107â118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post 1945===
====Biology====
The biological sciences department evolved rapidly from 1946 to 1972 as its research focus changed, due to the Cold War and other historically significant conditions external to academia. Stanford science went through three phases of experimental direction during that time. In the early 1950s the department remained fixed in the classical independent and self-directed research mode, shunning interdisciplinary collaboration and excessive government funding. Between the 1950s and mid-1960s biological research shifted focus to the molecular level. Then, from the late 1960s onward, Stanford's goal became applying research and findings toward humanistic ends. Each phase was preempted by larger social issues, such as the escalation of the Cold War, the launch of Sputnik, and public concern over [[medical abuses]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric J.; Vettel,  &quot;The Protean Nature of Stanford University's Biological Sciences, 1946-1972&quot;, ''Historical Studies in the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences; 2004 35(1): 95-113&lt;/ref&gt;

====High tech====
A powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valley. From the 1890s, the university's leaders saw its mission as service to the West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient indigenous local industry. Thus, regionalism helped align Stanford's interests with those of the area's high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley's development. The distinctive regional ethos of the West during the first half of the 20th century is an ingredient of Silicon Valley's already prepared environment, an ingredient that would-be replicators ignore at their peril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1093/es/khg025 | last1 = Adams | first1 = Stephen B. | year = 2003 | title = Regionalism in Stanford's Contribution to the Rise of Silicon Valley | url = | journal = Enterprise &amp; Society | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 521â543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s and 1950s, [[Frederick Terman]], as dean of engineering and provost,  encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies. He is credited with nurturing [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Varian Associates]], and other high-tech firms, until what would become [[Silicon Valley]] grew up around the Stanford campus. Terman is often called &quot;the father of Silicon Valley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CAROLYN E. TAJNAI,   FRED TERMAN, THE FATHER OF SILICON VALLEY; 1985 [http://www.netvalley.com/archives/mirrors/terman.html netvalley.com background]&lt;/ref&gt;  Terman encouraged [[William B. Shockley]],  co-inventor  of  the  transistor,  to return  to  his  hometown  of  Palo  Alto.  In 1956 he established the Shockley Transistor Laboratory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carolyn&quot;&gt;[http://forum.stanford.edu/carolyn/valley_of_hearts From the Valley of Heart's Delight to the Silicon Valley: A Study of Stanford University's Role in the Transformation] By Â©Carolyn E.Tajnai.

====Physics====
In 1962-70 negotiations took place between the Cambridge Electron Accelerator Laboratory (shared by [[Harvard]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]), the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]], and the [[US Atomic Energy Commission]] over the proposed 1970 construction of the Stanford Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring (SPEAR). It would be the first US electron-positron colliding beam storage ring. Paris (2001) explores the competition and cooperation between the two university laboratories and presents diagrams of the proposed facilities, charts detailing location factors, and the parameters of different project proposals between 1967 and 1970. Several rings were built in Europe during the five years that it took to obtain funding for the project, but the extensive project revisions resulted in a superior design that was quickly constructed and paved the way for Nobel Prizes in 1976 for [[Burton Richter]] and in 1995 for [[Martin Perl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.355 | last1 = Paris | first1 = Elizabeth | year = 2001 | title = Lords of the Ring: the Fight to Build the First U.S. Electron-positron Collider | url = | journal = Historical Studies in the Physical &amp; Biological Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 355â380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
During 1955-85, solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations, mainly Bell Telephone Laboratories, Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Xerox PARC. In 1969 the [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]] operated one of the four original nodes that comprised [[ARPANET]], predecessor to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LÃ©cuyer | first1 = Christophe | year = 2005 | title = What Do Universities Really Owe Industry?

==Campus==
[[File:Stanford University May 7 2011 003.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Main entrance to Stanford University]]
Stanford University is located on an {{convert|8180|acre|ha|sing=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford_tours&quot;/&gt; campus on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]], in the northwest part of the [[Santa Clara Valley]] ([[Silicon Valley]]) approximately {{convert|37|mi|km|0|sp=us}} southeast of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] and approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} northwest of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. The main campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]], Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Boulevard, and [[Sand Hill Road]]. The university also operates the several remote locations ([[Stanford University#Non-main_campus|see below]]).

Stanford's main campus is actually its own [[Stanford, California|census-designated place]] within [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]], although some of the university land (including the [[Stanford Shopping Center]] and the [[Stanford Research Park]]) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated [[San Mateo County, California|San Mateo County]] (including the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] and the [[Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve]]), as well as in the city limits of  [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]] (Stanford Hills neighborhood), [[Woodside, California|Woodside]], and [[Portola Valley, California|Portola Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/about/facts/lands.html |title=The Stanford Lands|accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Postal Service]] has assigned Stanford two [[ZIP codes]]: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for [[Post Office box|P.O. box]] mail. It lies within [[area code 650]].

===History of campus development===
[[Image:Stanford Campus Aerial Photo.JPG|300px|thumb|right|An [[aerial photography|aerial photograph]] of the Stanford University campus]]
In the summer of 1886, when the campus was first being planned, Stanford brought the president of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Francis Amasa Walker]], and prominent [[Boston]] landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] westward for consultations. Olmsted worked out the general concept for the campus and its buildings, rejecting a hillside site in favor of the more practical flatlands. [[Charles Allerton Coolidge]] then developed this concept in the style of his late mentor, [[Henry Hobson Richardson]], in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style, characterized by rectangular stone buildings linked by arcades of half-circle arches. The original campus was also designed in the Spanish-colonial style common to California known as [[Mission Revival]]. The red tile roofs and solid [[sandstone]] masonry are distinctly Californian in appearance and famously complementary to the bright blue skies common to the region, and most of the subsequently erected buildings have maintained consistent exteriors.

Much of this first construction was destroyed by the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], but the university retains the Quad, the old Chemistry Building (which is not in use and has been boarded up since the 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://quake06.stanford.edu/centennial/tour/stop2.html Stanford centennial tour]&lt;/ref&gt; and Encina Hall (the residence of [[Herbert Hoover]], [[John Steinbeck]], and [[Anthony Kennedy]] during their times at Stanford). After the 1989 earthquake inflicted further damage, the university implemented a billion-dollar capital improvement plan to retrofit and renovate older buildings for new, up-to-date uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rivalry History&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Rick |last=DelVecchio |title=Stanford pranks pique Cal |curly=y |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2005/11/18/BAGS4FQHIS1.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |page=B-1 |date=November 18, 2005 |accessdate=17 November 2008 |quote=The Cal-Stanford football rivalry, which began in 1892, has produced some memorable mischievous student tricks.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Faculty residences===
One of the benefits of being a Stanford faculty member is the &quot;Faculty Ghetto&quot;, where faculty members can live within walking or biking distance of campus. The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned entirely by Stanford. Similar to a [[condominium]], the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the &quot;Ghetto&quot; appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall [[Silicon Valley]] values. However, it remains an expensive area in which to own property, and the average price of single-family homes on campus is actually higher than in Palo Alto. Stanford itself enjoys the rapid capital gains of Silicon Valley landowners, although by the terms of its founding the university cannot sell the land.

===Non-main campus===
Stanford currently operates or intends to operate in various locations outside of its main campus.

On the founding grant but away from the main campus:
*[[Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve]] is a {{convert|1200|acre|ha|adj=on}} nature reserve owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research, located south of the main campus.
*[[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] is a facility located south of main campus and originally owned by Stanford but now operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest [[linear particle accelerator]] in the world, {{convert|2|mi|km}} on {{convert|426|acre|ha}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.slac.stanford.edu/AboutSLAC.aspx | title=About SLAC|accessdate= 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Off the founding grant:
*[[Hopkins Marine Station]], located in [[Pacific Grove, California]], is a [[marine biology]] research center owned by the university since 1892.
*Study abroad locations: unlike typical [[Student exchange program|study abroad]] programs, Stanford itself operates in locations around the globe; thus, each location, which ranges from [[Beijing]] to [[Cape Town]], has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a &quot;mini Stanford.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bosp.stanford.edu/faculty/index.html | title = Bing Overseas Study Program | accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locations in development:
*Redwood City: in 2005, the university purchased a small, {{convert|35|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices, although it remains undeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2010/07/29/redwood-city-campus-remains-undeveloped/ |title=Redwood City campus remains undeveloped |publisher=The Stanford Daily |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*China: the university is currently building a small campus for researchers and students in collaboration with [[Peking University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2011/04/01/faculty-senate-addresses-peking-cente-earthquakes-and-curriculum/ | title=Faculty Senate addresses Peking Center, earthquakes and curriculum | date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*New York: the university has submitted a &quot;formal expression of interest&quot; in response to the city of New York's call for proposals to build an engineering campus as a partnership between the city and a &quot;world-class institution.&quot; If selected, Stanford would build a satellite campus on [[Roosevelt Island]] for engineering, with a focus on information technology, and would also draw on Stanford's Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, the Graduate School of Business and the Technology Ventures Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2011/03/28/stanford-submits-formal-%E2%80%98expression-of-interest%E2%80%99-for-nyc-campus/ | title=Stanford submits formal âexpression of interestâ for NYC campus | publisher=The Stanford Daily |date= 28 March 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university also has its own golf course and a seasonal lake ([[Lake Lagunita]], actually an irrigation reservoir), both home to the vulnerable [[California Tiger Salamander]]. [[Lake Lagunita]] is often dry now, but the university has no plans to artificially fill it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2005/4/4/noPlansToFillLakeLagunita |title=No plans to fill Lake Lagunita |accessdate=12 January 2009 |date=4 April 2005 |author=Bea Sanford |publisher=[[The Stanford Daily]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{wide image|Lakelag.jpg|800px|&lt;center&gt;''Lake Lagunita in early spring; the Dish is visible in the foothills behind the lake.''&lt;/center&gt;}}

===Sustainability ===
'''Sustainable Stanford''' is a university-wide effort to reduce environmental impact, preserve resources and show sustainability in action. Administrators, faculty, staff, and students throughout the university are working to research and implement sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainable.stanford.edu/ Sustainable Stanford]&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this effort is the Environment Initiative on the Environment and Sustainability, a campaign launched to support interdisciplinary research and teaching in all seven of Stanfordâs schools and key institutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/layout/tsc/Environment Initiative on the Environment and Sustainability]&lt;/ref&gt; Through the initiative, the Stanford community is working to ensure future generations can live well on the planet.

The Department of Sustainability and Energy Management (SEM) leads initiatives in campus infrastructure and programs in the areas of energy and climate, water, transportation, green buildings, and sustainable information technology, as well as various special initiatives. The Office of Sustainability connects campus organizations and entities and works collaboratively with them to steer sustainability initiatives to fulfill President Hennessyâs vision that sustainability will, &quot;become a core value in everything we do.&quot; The office works on long-range sustainability analysis and planning, evaluations and reporting, communication and outreach, academic integration, conservation behavior and training, and sustainability governance strategy.
For the third consecutive year, Stanford received designation of an Overall Campus Sustainability Leader from the Sustainable Endowments Instituteâs College Sustainability Report Card. Stanford earned straight âAâ grades in the following topic areas: administration, climate change &amp; energy, food &amp; recycling, green building, student involvement, transportation, investment priorities, and shareholder engagement. The ''2009â2010 Year in Review'' provides an overview of the most recent sustainability efforts on campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainable.stanford.edu/sites/sem.stanford.edu/files/documents/SSYearReview2009-10.pdf 2009â2010 Year in Review]&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sustainable Stanford program continues to improve sustainable practices on campus:
* In 2009, Stanford announced a Climate and Energy Plan that exceeds California's AB 32 Global Warming Solutions Act.
* Since 1993, energy retrofits of older buildings have resulted in an estimated savings of more than 240 million kilowattâhours of electricityâabout 15 months of the universityâs current use.
* More than a million square feet of new construction has come online with high energy and water efficiency.
* Achieved a 21% reduction in domestic water use on campus in 2010 compared with 2000, despite more than 1 million additional GSF added to the building portfolio.
* The recycling program diverts 65 percent of waste from landfills.
* About 40 percent of produce purchased is organic and/or regionally grown, and Stanford helps support about 30 small farms that grow organic produce.
* Designated a Gold-Level âBicycle Friendly Community,â Stanford boasts 13,000 bikes on campus daily and {{convert|11.7|mi|km}} of bike lanes.
* Employee drive-alone rate has been reduced from 72 percent in 2002 to 48 percent in 2010âcompared to the national rate of 77 percentâand transit ridership has increased from 8 to 26 percent.
The award-winning transportation program includes the free 41-bus, 15-route Marguerite system running on biodiesel with two diesel-electric hybrid buses; the 7,500-member Commute Club; free transit on Caltrain, VTA, Dumbarton Express and AC Transitâs Line U; Zipcar car sharing; commute planning; charter services; and a bicycle program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transportation.stanford.edu/ transportation program]&lt;/ref&gt;
Ridership on Marguerite buses climbed to 1,416,508 in 2009. Shuttle ridership at the Caltrain commuter rail stations increased an estimated 30 percent between 2004 and 2009. In 2010, 52 percent of employees used alternative transportation to commute, compared with 24 percent in Santa Clara County

==Administration and organization==
Stanford University is a tax-exempt [[corporate trust]] owned and governed by a privately appointed 35-member [[Board of Trustees]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FG facts&quot;/&gt; Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin/4807.htm |title=Stanford BulletinâBoard of Trustees |publisher=Stanford University Registrar's Office |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stanford trustees also oversee the [[Stanford Research Park]], the [[Stanford Shopping Center]], the [[Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts|Cantor Center for Visual Arts]], [[Stanford University Medical Center]], and many associated medical facilities (including the [[Lucile Packard Children's Hospital]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;FG facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/about/facts/finances.html |title=Stanford University FactsâFinances and Governance |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board appoints a President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, manage financial and business affairs, and appoint nine vice presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin/4808.htm |title=Stanford BulletinâThe President |publisher=Stanford University Registrar's Office |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John L. Hennessy]] was appointed the 10th President of the University in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/president/biography/ |title=Office of the PresidentâBiography |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Provost&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin/4810.htm |title=Stanford BulletinâThe Provost |publisher=Stanford University Registrar's Office |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Etchemendy]] was named the 12th Provost in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/provost/biography/ |title=Office of the ProvostâBiography |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is organized into seven schools: [[Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences|School of Humanities and Sciences]], [[Stanford University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]], [[Stanford University School of Earth Sciences|School of Earth Sciences]], [[Stanford University School of Education|School of Education]], [[Stanford Graduate School of Business|Graduate School of Business]], [[Stanford Law School]] and the [[Stanford University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Provost&quot;/&gt; The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators, but most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 55 elected representatives of the faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin/4811.htm |title=Stanford BulletinâThe Academic Council |publisher=Stanford University Registrar's Office |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Students of Stanford University]] (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford University and all registered students are members.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASSU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/registrar/bulletin/4813.htm |title=Stanford BulletinâAssociated Students of Stanford University |publisher=Stanford University Registrar's Office |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] by the entire student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASSU&quot;/&gt;

Stanford enrolled 6,887 undergraduate&lt;ref name=&quot;TUP&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stanford.edu/about/facts/undergraduate.html|title=The Undergraduate Program: Stanford University Facts|accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 8,779 graduate students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stanford.edu/about/facts/graduate.html|title=Graduate Program: Stanford University Facts|accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2010-2011 year. Women comprised 48% of undergraduates and 37% of professional and graduate students.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt; The freshman retention rate for 2010 was 98%, the four-year graduation rate is 78.4%, and the six-year rate is 95%.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt; The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or &quot;coterm&quot;) program, which allows students to earn a Master's degree as an extension of their undergraduate program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college/highest-grad-rate |title=Best CollegesâEducationâUS News and World Report |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford awarded 1,671 undergraduate degrees, 2,068 Master's degrees, 708 doctoral degrees, and 270 professional degrees in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt; The most popular Bachelor's degrees were in the social sciences, interdisciplinary studies, and engineering.

For the class of 2014, Stanford received 32,022 applications and accepted 2300 or 7.2%, the lowest in the university's history and among the lowest in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2010/pr-freshman-admit-letters-032910.html|title=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2010/pr-freshman-admit-letters-032910.html|accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the class of 2015, Stanford received 5,929 single-choice early action applications and accepted 754 of them, for an early admission rate of 12.7%.

From a 2010 poll done by ''[[The Princeton Review]]'', Stanford is the most commonly named &quot;dream college,&quot; both for students and for parents, a title it has held in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10709802/princeton-reviews-2010-college-hopes-worries-survey.html |title=Princeton Review's 2010 College Hopes &amp; Worry Survey |publisher=PR Newswire |date=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2011 Times Higher Education World Reputation ranking (based on a survey of 13,388 academics over 131 countries, the largest evaluation of academic reputation to date&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/10/world-top-100-universities-reputation-rankings-reputation-times-higher-education | title=World's top 100 universities 2011: their reputations ranked by Times Higher Education | publisher= Guardian | accessdate=2011-03-26 | location=UK | first=Ami | last=Sedghi | date=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Stanford is 4th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/reputation-rankings.html|title=Top Universities by Reputation 2011|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=2011-03-26|location=UK|date=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 [[Gallup]] poll, which asked about the best colleges in the U.S., found that Stanford is the second-most prestigious university (behind [[Harvard]]) in the eyes of the general American public and roughly equal in prestige to Harvard among college-education people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/9109/harvard-number-one-university-eyes-public.aspx | title=Harvard Number One in Eyes of Public | accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts===
[[Image:Les-bourgeois-de-Calais.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze statues by [[Auguste Rodin]] are scattered through the campus, including these ''[[The Burghers of Calais|Burghers of Calais]]''.]]
Stanford University is home to the [[Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts|Cantor Center for Visual Arts]] museum with 24 galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. Notably, the Center possesses the largest collection of Rodin works outside of Paris, France. There are also a large number of outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features handmade wood carvings and &quot;totem poles.&quot;

Stanford has a thriving artistic and musical community. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society and the Stanford Shakespeare Society, award-winning [[a cappella]] music groups such as the [[Stanford Mendicants|Mendicants]], Counterpoint, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers, [[Stanford Harmonics|Harmonics]], Mixed Company, Testimony, [[Talisman A Cappella|Talisman]], Everyday People, Raagapella, and a group dedicated to performing the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], the Stanford Savoyards. Beyond these, the music department sponsors many ensembles including five choirs, the [[Stanford Symphony Orchestra]], [[Stanford Taiko]], and the Stanford Wind Ensemble.

Stanford's dance community is one of the most vibrant in the country, with an active dance division in the Drama Department and over 30 different dance-related student groups, including the [[Stanford Band]]'s [[Stanford Band#The Dollies|Dollie]] dance troupe.

Perhaps most distinctive of all is its [[social dance|social]] and [[vintage dance]] community, cultivated by dance historian [[Richard Powers (dance historian)|Richard Powers]] and enjoyed by hundreds of students and thousands of alumni. Stanford hosts monthly informal dances (called Jammix) and large quarterly dance events, including Ragtime Ball (fall), the Stanford Viennese Ball (winter), and Big Dance (spring). Stanford also boasts a student-run swing performance troupe called [[Swingtime Dance Troupe|Swingtime]] and several alumni performance groups, including Decadance and the Academy of Danse Libre.

The [[creative writing]] program brings young writers to campus via the [[Stegner Fellowship]]s and other graduate scholarship programs. ''[[This Boy's Life]]'' author [[Tobias Wolff]] teaches writing to undergraduates and graduate students. Knight Journalism Fellows are invited to spend a year at the campus taking seminars and courses of their choice. There is also an extracurricular writing and performance group called the Stanford Spoken Word Collective, which also serves as the school's poetry slam team.

Stanford also hosts various publishing courses for professionals. Stanford Professional Publishing Course, which has been offered on campus since the late 1970s, brings together international publishing professionals to discuss changing business models in magazine and book publishing.

==Endowment and fundraising==

The university's [[financial endowment|endowment]], managed by the [[Stanford Management Company]], was valued at $17.2 billion in 2008 and had achieved an annualized rate of return of 15.1% since 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;FG facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanfordmanage.org/smc_endowment.html |title=Endowment Asset Allocation |publisher=Stanford Management Company |accessdate=2008-11-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the economic downturn of January 2009, however, the endowment has dropped 20 to 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_11540137 |title=Stanford suspends $1.3 billion in construction projects as endowment plunges|accessdate=2009-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', &quot;Stanford's endowment has lost approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, or 20 to 30 percent of its value&quot; since 2008. As a result, all campus units cut their budgets by about 15 percent in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/25/SPOR1653KJ.DTL|title=Stanford athletics cuts 21 posts|last=FitzGerald|first=Tom|date=2009-02-26|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|pages=Dâ5|accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanford has been the top fundraising university in the United States for several years, sometimes doubling the fundraising amounts of its top competitors. It raised $911 million in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aDSe5LFAV18s|title=Stanford Tops Harvard, Yale With $911 Million in Private Gifts|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; $832 million in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/02/20/gifts| title=Donations Are Up, But Not From Alumni|publisher=Insider Higher Ed|accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; $785 million in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Top Fund-Raising Institutions, 2007-8 | work = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]| page = A16| date = March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; $640 million in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2010/10/29/stanford-giving-drops-in-2009-still-tops-list-of-universities/ |title=Stanford giving drops in 2009, still tops list of universities | publisher=The Stanford Daily|date = October 29, 2010|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $599 million in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stanford.edu/about/facts/finances.html|title=Finances: Stanford University Facts|accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, President Hennessy launched the Stanford Challenge, a $4.3 billion fundraising campaign focusing on three components: multidisciplinary research initiatives, initiatives to improve education, and core support.&lt;ref name=StanfordChallenge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/2006/pr-challenge-101106.html |title=The Stanford Challenge: University sets out to address global problems, educate leaders, foster excellence |publisher=Stanford |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Stanford surpassed that goal two years ahead of time, despite the economic downturn, making it the most successful collegiate fundraising effort in history;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2009/09/28/fundraising-effort-passes-key-milestone/ |title=Fundraising effort passes key milestone|publisher=The Stanford Daily|year=2009|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Stanford has continued with the campaign for its final two years in order to meet all its initial goals fully.

==Student life==
[[Image:Stanford-bikes.jpg|thumb|Many students use bicycles to get around the large campus.]]

===Dormitories and student housing===
Eighty-nine percent of undergraduate students live in on-campus university housing, partially because first-year students are required to live on campus, and because students are guaranteed housing for all four years of their undergraduate careers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDS&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/rde/shs/ugrad/eligibility_09.htm |title=Stanford UniversityâStudent HousingâApply for Housing 2009-10 |publisher=Stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Stanford Housing Assignments Office, undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, [[Stanford Row House Program|row houses]], [[Stanford University#Greek life|fraternities and sororities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ugradres&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/resed/Residences/ |title=Stanford HousingâUndergraduate Residences |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Manzanita Park, 118 [[mobile home]]s were installed as &quot;temporary&quot; housing from 1969 to 1991, but it is now the site of modern dorms Castano, Kimball, and Lantana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/91/910724Arc1246.html |title=Manzanita trailers to house Webb Ranch workers |publisher=News.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most student residences are located just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are for freshmen only; others give priority to sophomores, others to both freshmen and sophomores; some are for upperclass students only, and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male [[fraternity|fraternities]], three are all-female [[sorority|sororities]], and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors), including all Wilbur dorms except for Arroyo and Okada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/rde/shs/ugrad/wilbur.htm#junipero |title=Stanford UniversityâStudent HousingâTour Undergraduate Housing |publisher=Stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2009â10, the University's housing plan anticipates that all freshmen desiring to live in all-freshman dorms will be accommodated. In the 2009â10 year, almost two-thirds of freshmen will be housed in Stern and Wilbur Halls. The one-third who requested four-class housing will be located in other dormitories throughout campus, including Florence Moore (FloMo).&lt;ref name=&quot;froshhousing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parents.stanford.edu/newsletter/09fall/golder.html |title=Parents' Newsletter, Fall 2009âGolder looks to improve life and learning in the residences |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, Stanford unveiled a new pilot plan to test out gender-neutral housing in five campus residences, allowing males and females to live in the same room. This was after concerted student pressure, as well as the institution of similar policies at peer institutions such as [[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]], [[Oberlin College|Oberlin]], [[Clark University|Clark]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[Brown University|Brown]], and [[University of Pennsylvania|UPenn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;genderblind&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2008/4/8/genderneutralHousingPlanUnveiled |title=Gender-neutral housing plan unveiled |publisher=Stanford Daily |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-27 |last=Xu |first=Joanna |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080621003855/http://daily.stanford.edu/article/2008/4/8/genderneutralHousingPlanUnveiled &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language and Culture Houses include EAST (East Asian Studies Theme), HammarskjÃ¶ld (International Theme), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Theme), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison FranÃ§aise (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Theme House), Storey (Human Biology Theme House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture).Cross-Cultural Theme Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Theme), Okada (Asian-American Theme in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Theme in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Freshman Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts &amp; Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:Q1Xvw_n8I54J:www.stanford.edu/dept/resed/Residences/+housing+stanford+slav&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;gl=us&amp;strip=1 |title=Stanford Undergraduate Residences |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2009-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous style of housing at Stanford is the [[housing cooperative|co-ops]]. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. The co-ops on campus are Chi Theta Chi, Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), HammarskjÃ¶ld (which is also the International Theme House), Kairos, Terra, and Synergy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/resed/Staff/StaffResources/StudentMgmt/CoOps.html |title=Residential EducationâCooperative Houses |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At any time, around 50 percent of the graduate population lives on campus. Now that construction has concluded on the new Munger graduate residence, this percentage has probably increased. First-year graduate students are guaranteed housing.

Each girl is given a single rose and is then brought to the dorm lounge where all of the guys serenade the girls with a love song. {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}
*Assassins: Participating students are assigned a target to &quot;kill&quot; with a water gun.  A &quot;kill&quot; is only valid if no other person witnesses the &quot;kill&quot; and the target is &quot;killed&quot; outside of his/her dorm room and bathroom.  Over a period of weeks, targets are eliminated until only one assassin victoriously remains. {{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on [[Lake Lagunita]] (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which is now inactive because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.

===Greek life===

Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891, when the University first opened. In 1944, University President [[Donald Tresidder]] banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chapters.kappakappagamma.org/betaeta/pages/our-chapter.php |title=Kappa Kappa Gamma |publisher=Chapters.kappakappagamma.org |date=1944-04-26 |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following [[Title IX]], the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;http://cgi.stanford.edu/group/chiomega/cgi-bin/history.php&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford is now home to 29 Greek organizations, including 13 sororities and 16 fraternities, representing 13% of undergraduates. In contrast to many universities, nine of the ten housed Greek organizations live in University-owned houses, the exception being [[Sigma Chi]], which owns its own house (but not the land) on The Row. Six chapters are members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, 11 chapters are members of the Interfraternity Council, 6 chapters belong to the Intersorority Council, and 6 chapters belong to the Multicultural Greek Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osa.stanford.edu/greek/learn/whatis.htm |title=What is Greek Life @ Stanford? |publisher=Osa.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Stanford is home to three unhoused historically NPHC ([[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] or &quot;Divine Nine&quot;) three sororities ([[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], and [[Sigma Gamma Rho]]) and three unhoused NPHC fraternities ([[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], and [[Phi Beta Sigma]]). These fraternities and sororities operate under the AAFSA (African American Fraternal Sororal Association) at Stanford.

*Seven historically NPC ([[National Panhellenic Conference]]) sororities, four of which are unhoused ([[Alpha Phi]], [[Alpha Epsilon Phi]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]]) and three of which are housed ([[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Pi Beta Phi]]) call Stanford home. These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).

*Eleven historically NIC ([[National Interfraternity Conference]]) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including four unhoused fraternities ([[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], and [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]]), and seven housed fraternities ([[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], and [[Theta Delta Chi]]). These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).

*There are also four unhoused MGC (Multicultural Greek Council) sororities on campus ([[Alpha Kappa Delta Phi]], [[Lambda Theta Nu]], [[Sigma Psi Zeta]], and [[Sigma Theta Psi]]), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities ([[Gamma Zeta Alpha]] and [[Lambda Phi Epsilon]]). Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdaphiepsilon.com/about.php |title=Lambda Phi Epsilon National Fraternity |publisher=Lambdaphiepsilon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student groups===
Stanford offers its students the opportunity to engage in over 650 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/uga/student/organizations/index.html |title=Student Organizations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the University via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include &quot;special fees&quot;, which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span from Athletic/Recreational, Careers/Pre-professional, Community Service, Ethnic/Cultural, Fraternities/Sororities, Health/Counseling, Media/Publications, Music/Dance/Creative Arts, Political/Social Awareness to Religious/Philosophical.

*The Stanford Fleet Street Singers is an all-male [[A cappella|Acappella]] group specializing in comedic original compositions, [[jazz]], and Stanford fight songs. Because Fleet Street maintains Stanford songs as a regular part of its performing repertoire, Stanford University used the group as ambassadors during the University's centennial celebration and commissioned an album, entitled Up Toward Mountains Higher (1999), of Stanford songs which were sent to alumni around the world.
* The Stanford Martial Arts Program (SMAP) is an umbrella organization for 11 different martial arts groups on campus: Aikido, Capoeira, Eskrima, Judo, Jujitsu, Kenpo Karate, Muay Thai, Wing Chun, JKA Shotokan, Taekwondo, and Wushu.

==Athletics==
{{Main|Stanford Cardinal}}

Stanford participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I-A and is a member of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]]. Stanford has constantly won the NACDA Directors' Cup, The University of North Carolina won the award for best Division I collegiate athletics program in its inaugural year. Since then, Stanford University has won it seventeen straight years, winning seventeen out of the eighteen years it has been offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://champions.stanford.edu/history/by-the-numbers/ |title=Stanford Athletics âBy the Numbersâ |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also participates in the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] for indoor [[track and field|track]] (men and women), fencing (men and women), [[water polo]] (men and women), women's [[gymnastics]], women's [[lacrosse]], men's [[gymnastics]], and men's [[volleyball]]. The women's [[field hockey]] team is part of the [[NorPac Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norpacfieldhockey.com/ |title=NorPac |publisher=i2i Interactive |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford's traditional sports rival is the [[University of California, Berkeley]], its neighbor to the north in the East Bay.

Stanford offers 34 varsity sports (18 female, 15 male, one coed), 19 club sports and 37 intramural sportsâabout 800 students participate in intercollegiate sports. The university offers about 300 athletic scholarships.
[[Image:Stanstadium view.jpg|thumb|right|The new [[Stanford Stadium]], site of home football games.]]

The winner of the annual &quot;[[Big Game (football)|Big Game]]&quot; between the Cal and Stanford football teams gains custody of [[the Stanford Axe]]. The first &quot;Big Game&quot;, played at Haight Street Park in San Francisco on March 19, 1892, established football on the west coast. Stanford won 14 to 10 in front of 8 thousand spectators. Stanford's football team played in the first [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] in 1902. However, the violence of the sport at the time, coupled with the post-game rioting of drunken spectators, led San Francisco to bar further &quot;Big Games&quot; in the city in 1905. In 1906, David Starr Jordan banned football from Stanford. The 1906â1914 &quot;Big Game&quot; contests featured rugby instead of football. Stanford football was resumed in 1919.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starr3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=Americans and the California Dream|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1973|pages=336â338|chapter=Life Among the Best and Truest: David Starr Jordan and the Founding of Stanford University |isbn=0-19-501644-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford won back-to-back Rose Bowls in 1971 and 1972. Stanford has played in 12 Rose Bowls, most recently in 2000. Stanford's [[Jim Plunkett]] won the [[Heisman Trophy]] in 1970.

Club sports, while not officially a part of Stanford athletics, are numerous at Stanford. Sports include [[archery]], [[badminton]], [[cheerleading]], [[cricket]], [[cycling]], [[Equestrianism|equestrian]], [[hurling]], [[ice hockey]], [[judo]], [[kayaking]], [[Lacrosse|men's lacrosse]], [[polo]], [[racquetball]], [[rugby union]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[skiing]], [[taekwondo]], [[tennis]], [[triathlon]] and [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]]. The men's Ultimate team won national championships in 1984 and 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;UPA College Open Champions&quot;&gt;[http://upa.org/hallofchampions/college/openchampions College Open Champions Ultimate Players Association]&lt;/ref&gt; the women's Ultimate team in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;UPA College Women's Champions&quot;&gt;[http://upa.org/hallofchampions/college/womenschampions College Women's Champions Ultimate Players Association]&lt;/ref&gt; the women's rugby team in 1999, 2005, 2006 and 2008. The cycling team won the 2007 Division I USA Cycling Collegiate Road National Championships.

Until 1930, Stanford did not have a &quot;mascot&quot; name for its athletic teams. In that year, the athletic department adopted the name &quot;Indians.&quot; In 1972, &quot;Indians&quot; was dropped after a complaint of racial insensitivity was lodged by Native American students.
[[Image:11-04-06-LSJUMB-003.jpg|thumb|The [[Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band]] rallies football fans with arrangements of &quot;All Right Now&quot; and other contemporary music.]]

The Stanford sports teams are now officially referred to as the Stanford [[cardinal (color)|Cardinal]], referring to the deep red color, not the [[cardinal (bird)|cardinal bird]]. Cardinal, and later cardinal and white has been the university's official color since the 19th century. The Band's mascot, [[Stanford Tree|&quot;The Tree&quot;]], has become associated with the school in general. Part of the [[Stanford Band|Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB)]], the tree symbol derives from the [[El Palo Alto]] redwood tree on the Stanford and City of Palo Alto seals.

Stanford hosts an annual [[U.S. Open Series]] tennis tournament, the [[Bank of the West Classic]], at [[Taube Stadium]]. [[Cobb Track]], [[Angell Field]], and [[Avery Stadium Pool]] are considered world-class athletic facilities. [[Stanford Stadium]] hosted [[Super Bowl XIX]] on January 20, 1985, in which the [[San Francisco 49ers]] defeated the [[Miami Dolphins]] by a score of 38â16 and several group stage matches in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]].

Stanford has won the award for the top ranked collegiate athletic programâthe [[NACDA Director's Cup]], formerly known as the ''Sears Cup''âevery year for the past seventeen years. Stanford has had at least one NCAA team champion every year since the 1976-77 school year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-06-22-stanford-directors-cup_N.htm USA Today, June 22, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NCAA achievements:''' Stanford has earned 102 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] national team titles&lt;ref&gt;[http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/summaries/combined.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; since its establishment, second most behind the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and 467 individual National championships, the most by any university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://champions.stanford.edu/history/individual-national-champions/]&lt;/ref&gt; The 102nd championship was won by the 2011-2012 Stanford Women's Soccer team.
