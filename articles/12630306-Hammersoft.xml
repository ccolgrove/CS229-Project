The '''Operation Liberation''' or '''Vadamarachchi Operation''', the military offensive carried out by the [[Military of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan military]] during May to June 1987, to re-gain the territory of [[Vadamarachi|Vadamarachchi]] in [[Jaffna peninsula]] from the [[LTTE]] control. This military offensive marked in [[Sri Lanka]]n military history as first ever engaged in [[conventional warfare]] in Sri Lankan soil after the British colonial rule.

==The battle==
[[Brigadier]] [[Denzil Kobbekaduwa]] and [[Colonel]] [[Vijaya Wimalaratne]] are the two key military personnel who committed themselves to gain the victory for the government troops. Former [[President of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan President]] [[Junius Richard Jayewardene]] and minister of National Security [[Lalith Athulathmudali]] given the political leadership for the operation until the government of [[India]] violated the Sri Lankan air space using air force to [[Air Drop|drop]] food over Jaffna ([[Operation Poomalai]]) on June 4, 1987, which forced to accept [[Indo-Sri Lankan Accord]].

The offensive started on May 26, 1987, under the leadership of the two commanders with 8,000 troops from several battalions from [[Gemunu Watch]] (Under the Command of Lt. Colonel Vipul Botheju and Lt. Colonel Wasantha Perera), [[Gajaba Regiment]] (under the Command of Lt. Colonel Sathis Jayasundara and Major Gotabaya Rajapakse) and [[Sri Lanka Light Infantry]] (Under Lt. Colonel Naradha Wickramarathne), supported by the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]]. The difficulty for the troops to out from Thondamanaru area because LTTE forces blew up the Thondamanaru bridge to delay the troops reaching [[Valvettithurai]], the native place of LTTE leader [[V. Prabhakaran]]. Eastern side of Thondamanaru was heavliy mined by the LTTE and clearing of the mines and booby traps were left to a field engineer Squadron of the [[Sri Lanka Engineers]] commanded by Major Lucky Rajasinghe. First day of the battle belong to the heroics of field engineer squadron which suffered 42 deaths in a span of 4 hours and its squadren commander Lucky Rajasinghe, yet broke through the mine field under the intensive fire from the LTTE bunkers, with the support of the troops from the 1 Gajaba Regiment Commanded by Major Gotabaya Rajapakse. On May 28 troops managed to capture Udupiddy and Valvettithurai and also another military column (Commandos, under the command of Major Sarath Handapangoda) captured Nelliady and advanced towards [[Point Pedro]] without giving any possibility to re-grouping of the LTTE units. On first week of June troops managed gain control over entire zone and captured large amount of arms left by LTTE. The military intelligence disclosed the LTTE leader Prabakaran along with [[Sea Tiger]] leader [[Colonel Soosai]] narrowly escaped from advancing troops.

Though the second stage of this operation was launched on June 3, 1987, to capture the city of [[Jaffna]], the military abandoned it. Indian Aircraft escorted by fighter aircraft infiltrated Sri Lankan air space and dropped humanitarian relief supplies in the Jaffna area on June 4 as people of Jaffna mostly ethnic Tamils were without food and other provisions. No weapons were dropped and there is no record of dropping food or other provisions to Tamil Tigers as opposed to people. Operation Poomalai &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Poomalai&lt;/ref&gt; as it was known was only a relief operation. It had no bearing in stopping the war. After six weeks later Indian Forces landed in Sri Lanka on July 29 with the signing of Indo-Lanka Accord&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Sri-Lankan_accord&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Trivia==

* The current [[Permanent Secretary]] to the Ministry of Defence, Lt. Col. (Ret) [[Gotabaya Rajapaksa]], brother of the President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]], participated the military offensive, then as a [[Major]].
