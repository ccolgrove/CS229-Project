The company's name and logo originated from bankruptcy liquidation of the [[Napster]] [[peer-to-peer]] file trading service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Porno company offers to buy Napster | date=September 12, 2002 | publisher=CNET News.com | url=http://news.com.com/2100-1023-957784.html?tag=fd_top}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was shut down after a series of legal actions taken by the [[RIAA]]. The brand name was later purchased by [[Roxio]], to capitalize on the popularity of the former service. Napster was later acquired by [[Best Buy]].

===As a Roxio subsidiary===
Roxio bought the assets of the original [[Napster]] company at its [[bankruptcy]] [[auction]] in [[2002]] and the online music service called [[pressplay]] in [[2003]], with the intention of using these assets as the basis of a new legal online music service which would let users access music through a subscription or on a fee-per-song basis. Roxio spent years revamping the company as a non-free online music service. This involved a great deal of management re-organization and the start of a new business model. Roxio spent years developing a network of business partners and relationships to ensure success for their new enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{note|penn}}[http://live.psu.edu/story/4586 Penn State and Napster team up to make legal tunes available to students]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Security}}[http://www.engadget.com/2006/08/25/fairuse4wm-strips-windows-media-drm/ FairUse4WM strips Windows Media DRM!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{note|Security2}}[http://www.connectedhomemag.com/Articles/Print.cfm?ArticleID=45489&amp;Path=HomeOffice /How To Steal Music.....

In May 2006, Napster launched Free Napster (via the URL http://Free.Napster.com/) but this service was discontinued in March 2010. It was a free, advertising-supported Web experience which enabled music fans in the USA to stream full-length versions of all the songs in Napster's catalog of over 8 million tracks three times each, without downloading any software or making any service commitment. Visitors could also purchase DRM-free MP3 downloads.

===As a Best Buy company===

Napster was formerly headed by [[Chris Gorog]] who served as Chairman and CEO, Bradford D. Duea who served as President and Christopher Allen who served as Chief Operating Officer.  On January 6, 2010, Gorog and Duea stepped down from their positions.  In an interview, Gorog stated that &quot;After we understood the approach Best Buy was taking with Napster, it became clear the company didn't need a CEO, a president and a COO going forward&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ieea0d35bc59ea6b955f8b74ce7b0cfbe Q&amp;A: Napster ex-CEO Chris Gorog] by Antony Bruno, January 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Allen assumed the position of &quot;General Manager,&quot; reporting to Chris Homeister, Best Buy's senior vice president of merchandising entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20100106/former-napster-ceo%E2%80%99s-dream-more-of-a-nightmare-when-you-really-think-about-it/ Former Napster CEOâs âDreamâ More of a Nightmare When You Really Think About It] by John Paczkowski, January 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{note|acquisition3}} {{cite news | first=Larry | last=Dignan | date=September 15, 2008 | title=Best Buy acquires Napster; Eyes digital music distribution | url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=10026}}&lt;/ref&gt;
