I wish to apologize to Ian, to the club and its patrons and to anyone who was hurt or offended by my remark.|Andy Dick}}

On February 2, 2007, Dick was forcibly removed during an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'', after repeatedly touching guest [[Ivanka Trump]]. [[Jimmy Kimmel|Kimmel]] called in his security guards [[Frank Potenza|Uncle Frank]] and [[Veatrice Rice]], who assisted as Kimmel dragged Dick off-set by his legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/02/05/andy_dick_bothers_ivanka_trump_aamp_is_f |title=Andy Dick Bothers Ivanka Trump &amp; Is Forcibly Removed From Jimmy Kimmel Live Show |publisher=Starpulse.com |date=February 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 17, 2007, at the [[Laugh Factory]] comedy club in Los Angeles, Dick was in an altercation with his former ''NewsRadio'' co-star [[Jon Lovitz]], who claimed that, a year earlier, Dick had approached Lovitz at a restaurant and said, &quot;I put the [[Phil Hartman]] [[curse|hex]] on you; you're the next one to die,&quot; and demanded an apology from Dick. Lovitz has accused Dick of re-introducing Hartman's wife to [[cocaine]], who had a relapse, [[Phil Hartman#Death|killed Hartman while he slept]] in his [[Encino, California]] home, and then shot herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Posted: 5:00 AM, July 17, 2007 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/07172007/gossip/pagesix/pagesix.htm |title=Comic Clobbers Comic In L.A |publisher=Nypost.com |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lovitz joined the cast of ''NewsRadio'' as Hartman's replacement in its [[NewsRadio (season 5)|fifth and final season]], he told Dick: &quot;I wouldn't be here now if you hadn't given Brynn that cocaine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2009, Dick appeared on ''[[Sober House]]'', a ''[[Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew]]'' spin-off focusing on a [[sober living environment]]. Dick approached [[Dr. Drew Pinsky]] to ask for help with his addictions and agreed to enter the Sober Living house. In the penultimate episode, Dick explained that his drinking led to many of the public incidents for which he has become notorious, and had ruined many of his relationships. In that episode, he visited a number of the people whose lives he had so affected, such as comedian [[Mo Collins]], to apologize for disclosing information to her husband which led to her divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/celebrity_rehab/2008_Dec_19_sober_house_cast |title=Sober House Will Follow Celebrity Rehab Cast, Andy Dick in Sober Living |publisher=Realityblurred.com |date=December 19, 2008 |accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Dick was a guest on [[Greg Fitzsimmons]] radio show on Sirius XM Satellite Radio and gave an [[antisemitic]] rant directed towards [[Howard Stern]]. He labeled Stern a &quot;money grubbing Jew&quot; as well as repeatedly calling him a &quot;hook-nosed Jew&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Posted: August 18, 2011 |url=http://nation.foxnews.com/howard-stern/2011/08/18/andy-dick-goes-anti-semitic-tirade-against-howard-stern |title=Andy Dick Goes on Anti-Semitic Tirade Against Howard Stern |publisher=Nation.foxnews.com|date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
