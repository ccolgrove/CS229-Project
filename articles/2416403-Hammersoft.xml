'''''Ballet Master''''' (also ''Balletmaster'', ''Ballet Mistress'', ''Premier MaÃ®tre de ballet'' or ''Premier MaÃ®tre de ballet en Chef'') is the term used for an employee of a [[ballet company]] who is responsible for the level of competence of the dancers in their company. In modern times, ballet masters (or ballet mistress for a female) are generally charged with teaching the daily company ballet class and rehearsing the [[dancers]] for both new and established [[ballets]] in the company's repertoire. The artistic director of a ballet company may also be called its ballet master.

==History of the position==
Especially during the early centuries of ballet troupes and ballet companies from the 18th century until the early 20th century, the position of ''First'' Ballet master, referred to traditionally as the ''Premier MaÃ®tre de ballet en Chef'' or more simply as the ''MaÃ®tre de ballet'', was the undisputed head of the company who acted as chief choreographer and ''[[Artistic Director]]''. His duties included creating ballets, dances in operas, commissioning music, and presiding over the teaching of the dancers and style desired. It was this head ballet master who had the responsibility of the artistic directorship of a particular group of dancers or of a theatre.

After the early 20th century, primarily after the disbandment of the original [[Ballet Russe]], the title has been used more to describe the master teachers/assistant directors of a ballet company, (previously known as ''Second'' Ballet master), with the head of a company being referred to as the ''Artistic Director''.
