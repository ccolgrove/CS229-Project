'''Filesystem in Userspace''' ('''FUSE''') is a [[loadable kernel module]] for [[Unix-like]] [[computer]] [[operating system]]s that lets non-privileged users create their own [[file system]]s without editing [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] code. This is achieved by running [[file system]] code in [[user space]] while the FUSE module provides only a &quot;bridge&quot; to the actual [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] interfaces.

Released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] and the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], FUSE is [[free software]]. The FUSE system was originally part of [http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf A Virtual Filesystem] (AVFS), but has since split off into its own project on [[SourceForge.net]].

FUSE is available for [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] (as [[PUFFS (NetBSD)|puffs]]), [[OpenSolaris]], and [[Mac OS X]]. It was officially merged into the mainstream [[Linux kernel]] tree in [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] version 2.6.14.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/47839 {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Virtual file system==
FUSE is particularly useful for writing [[virtual file system]]s. Unlike traditional file systems that essentially save data to and retrieve data from disk, virtual filesystems do not actually store data themselves. They act as a view or translation of an existing file system or storage device.

In principle, any resource available to a FUSE implementation can be exported as a file system.

== Examples ==
*[[Wuala]]: A multi-platform, Java-based fully OS integrated distributed file system. Using FUSE, MacFUSE and [http://www.eldos.com/cbfs/ Callback File System] respectively for file system integration, in addition to a Java-based app accessible from any Java-enabled web browser.

*[[Sun Microsystems]]'s [[Lustre (file system)|Lustre]] cluster filesystem will use FUSE to allow it to run in userspace, so that a FreeBSD port is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lustre.sev.net.ua/| title = Lustre FreeBSD | accessdate = 2008-03-02
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[ZFS]]-Linux port of Lustre will be running ZFS's DMU (Data Management Unit) in userspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://arch.lustre.org/index.php?title=Architecture_ZFS_for_Lustre | title = Architecture ZFS for Lustre | accessdate = 2008-03-02 | publisher = Sun Microsystems}}&lt;/ref&gt;
