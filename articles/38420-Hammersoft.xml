==History==
===The philanthropist and the founding===
{{See also|Johns_Hopkins#Death_and_Philanthropy|l1=Johns Hopkins' Philanthropy and Legacy}}
[[File:Hopkinsp.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johns Hopkins]]]]

On his death in 1873, [[Johns Hopkins]], a [[Quaker]] [[entrepreneur]] and childless bachelor, bequeathed $7 million to fund a hospital and university in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jhu.edu/%7Egazette/1999/jan0499/obit.html] Obituary, Baltimore Sun, December 25, 1873 in Johns Hopkins Gazette, Jan. 4, 1999,v. 28,no. 16&lt;/ref&gt; At that time this fortune, generated primarily from the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who Was Johns Hopkins?|url=http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/about_jhu/who_was_johns_hopkins/}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts at a Glance|url=http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/about_jhu/facts_at_a_glance/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first name of philanthropist Johns Hopkins is the surname of his great-grandmother, Margaret Johns, who married Gerard Hopkins. They named their son Johns Hopkins, who named his own son Samuel Hopkins. Samuel named one of his sons after his father and that son would be the university's benefactor.

In his 2001 undergraduate commencement address, university president [[William R. Brody]] said about the name: &quot;In 1888, just 12 years after the university was founded, [[Mark Twain]] wrote about this university in a letter to a friend. He said: 'A few months ago I was told that the Johns Hopkins University had given me a degree. I naturally supposed this constituted me a Member of the Faculty and so I started in to help as I could there. I told them I believed they were perfectly competent to run a college as far as the higher branches of education are concerned, but what they needed was a little help here and there from a practical commercial man. I said the public is sensitive to little things and they wouldn't have full confidence in a college that didn't know how to spell the name ''John''.' More than a century later, we continue to bestow diplomas upon individuals of outstanding capabilities and great talent. And we continue to spell ''Johns'' with an ''s''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commencement 2001|author=Headlines@Hopkins|accessdate=2007-02-14|url= http://www.jhu.edu/news/commence01/wrb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Eisenhower]], once the university' president, once spoke to a convention in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. Making a common mistake, the [[Master of Ceremonies]] introduced him as &quot;President of ''John''&lt;!--[sic]---&gt; Hopkins.&quot; Eisenhower retorted that he was &quot;glad to be here in ''Pitt''burgh.&lt;!--[sic]---&gt;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-md.vozzella15dec15,0,7196427.column?coll=bal-home-columnists|title=Cheesecake on the Tart Side|author=Laura Vozzella|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date=2006-12-15|accessdate=2007-01-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070320152617/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-md.vozzella15dec15,0,7196427.column?coll=bal-home-columnists |archivedate = March 20, 2007}}: &quot;University spokesman Dennis O'Shea checked with Ross Jones, who was Eisenhower's assistant. And Jones confirmed it... Ross told O'Shea: 'I remember him telling me about it first thing after he got back. He was tickled with himself for picking up on it so quickly with that response. And then it became a legend! He would love the fact that it still has legs.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years and Daniel Coit Gilman===
The original board opted for an entirely novel university model dedicated to the discovery of knowledge at an advanced level, extending that of contemporary Germany. Johns Hopkins thereby became the model of the modern research university in the United States. Its success eventually shifted higher education in the United States from a focus on teaching revealed and/or applied knowledge to the scientific discovery of new knowledge. The university was intended to be national in scope to strengthen ties across a divided country in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War]]. Therefore, the university's official inauguration took on great significance: 1876 was the nation's centennial year and February 22 was [[George Washington]]'s birthday.{{Wikisource1911Enc|Johns Hopkins University|the Early History}}

The University's viability depended on its first president, [[Daniel Coit Gilman]], recruited from the presidency of the [[University of California]]. Gilman launched what many at the time considered to be an audacious and unprecedented academic experiment to merge teaching and research. He dismissed the idea that the two were mutually exclusive: &quot;The best teachers are usually those who are free, competent and willing to make original researches in the library and the laboratory,&quot; he stated. To implement his plan, Gilman recruited internationally known luminaries such as the biologist [[H. Newell Martin]]; the physicist [[Henry Augustus Rowland|Henry A. Rowland]] (the first president of the [[American Physical Society]]), the [[classical scholars]] [[Basil Gildersleeve]] and Charles D. Morris;&lt;ref&gt;The Johns Hopkins University Circular 1886, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; the economist [[Richard T. Ely]]; and the chemist [[Ira Remsen]], who became the second president of the university in 1901.
[[File:Daniel Coit Gilman.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Daniel Coit Gilman]]]]

Gilman focused on the expansion of knowledge, graduate education and support of faculty research. To Gilman, Johns Hopkins existed not for the sake of God, the state, the community, the board, the parents, or even the students, but for knowledge. Faculty who added to such knowledge were rewarded. A complementary focus on [[graduate education]] fused advanced scholarship with such professional schools as medicine and engineering. Hopkins became the national trendsetter in [[PhD|doctoral]] programs and the host for numerous [[scholarly journal]]s and associations with the founding of the first [[university press]] in 1878.

With the completion of [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in 1889 and the [[medical school]] in 1893, the university's researchâfocused mode of instruction soon began attracting world-renowned faculty members who would become major figures in the emerging field of academic medicine, including [[William Osler]], [[William Halsted]], [[Howard Kelly]], and [[William H. Welch|William Welch]]. During this period Hopkins made more history by becoming the first medical school to admit women on an equal basis with men and to require a [[Bachelors degree]], based on the efforts of [[Mary Garrett|Mary E. Garrett]], who had endowed the school at Gilman's request.

In his will and in his instructions to the trustees of the university and the hospital, Hopkins requested that both institutions be built upon the vast grounds of his Baltimore estate, Clifton. When Gilman assumed the presidency, he decided that it would be best to use the university's endowment for recruiting faculty and students, deciding to &quot;build men, not buildings.&quot; In his will Hopkins stipulated that none of his endowment should be used for construction; only interest on the principal could be used for this purpose. Unfortunately, stocks in The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] from which most of the interest would have been generated became virtually worthless soon after Hopkins's death. The university's first home was thus in Downtown [[Baltimore]] delaying plans to site the university in Clifton. This decision became the only major criticism of Gilman's presidency. In the early 1900s the university outgrew its buildings and the trustees began to search for a new home. Developing Clifton for the university was too costly, and so the estate became a public park. In the end, the {{convert|140|acre}} estate in north Baltimore known as [[Homewood campus|Homewood]] was purchased as the university's new campus with assistance from prominent Baltimore citizens.

Since the 1910s, Johns Hopkins University has famously been a &quot;fertile cradle&quot; to [[Arthur Lovejoy]]'s [[history of ideas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Paulson1970&quot;&gt;[[Ronald Paulson]] [http://www.jstor.org/pss/468272 ''English Literary History at the Johns Hopkins University''] in ''New Literary History'', Vol. 1, No. 3, History and Fiction (Spring, 1970), pp. 559-564&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], founded in 1878, is the oldest American [[university press]] in continuous operation. Along with the hospital, Hopkins established one of the nation's oldest [[Johns Hopkins School of Nursing|schools of nursing]] in 1889. The [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|school of medicine]] was the nation's first coeducational, graduate-level medical school and the prototype for academic medicine which emphasized bedside learning, research projects, and laboratory training. In 1909, the university was among the first to start adult [[continuing education]] programs and in 1916 it founded the US' first [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|school of public health]]. Programs in international studies and the performing arts were established in 1950 and 1977 when the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]] in Washington D.C and the [[Peabody Institute]] in Baltimore became divisions of the university.

===Civil rights===
====African-Americans====
Hopkins was a prominent [[abolitionist]] who supported [[Abraham Lincoln]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After his death his conviction was reported to be a decisive factor in enrolling Hopkins' first [[African-American]] student, [[Kelly Miller (scientist)|Kelly Miller]], a graduate student in physics, astronomy and mathematics, and in admitting Harvard-trained physician Whitfield Winsey and two other African-American physicians to Maryland's Medical and Chirurgical Society [[MedChi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdhistoryonline.net/mdmedicine/cfm/dsp_detail.cfm?id=1895 MDhistoryonline.net], Medicine in Maryland 1752â1920&lt;/ref&gt; These physicians could attend meetings only because they were held on campus. As the memory of Hopkins faded and trustees like King died, Hopkins became like other Baltimore institutions, particularly in terms of race. The Johns Hopkins University chronology stated that on March 15, 1892, an administrator hired by Gilman recommended that the hospital should have a &quot;separate ward for colored patients&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;webapps.jhu.edu&quot;&gt;[http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/about_jhu/chronology/index.cfmChronology JHU.edu]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johns Hopkins Hospital subsequently became a segregated facility. Johns Hopkins' &quot;separate but equal&quot; stance was evident when it came to these segregated wards: &quot;Special care will be taken to see that the heating and ventilation apparatus is as perfect as possible. A sun balcony will be erected on each floor on the east side, for convalescents, while a sun bay-window will be constructed at the south end of the south wing. On each floor there will be a dining room, kitchen, lavatory and bath-rooms...The building will be [[fireproof]] throughout.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;webapps.jhu.edu&quot;/&gt;

As segregation grew within Johns Hopkins institutions, it affected pay, hiring and promotions. Staff in segregated wards and those employed in the lower rungs of the service industries had the longest history within the Johns Hopkins Institutions. Johns Hopkins' students, physicians, administrators and staff of African descent had a much shorter history within these institutions.
The first black undergraduate was [[Frederick Scott]] who entered the school in 1945. In 1967 the first black students earned graduate degrees. Dr. James Nabwangu a British-trained [[Kenya]]n, was the first black graduate of the medical school. A second was earned by Robert Gamble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hmn/w98/sea.html |title=In a Sea of White Faces |publisher=Hopkinsmedicine.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first African-American instructor was laboratory supervisor [[Vivien Thomas]], who also invented and developed research instruments, served as an assistant in surgery to surgeon [[Alfred Blalock]] and worked closely with Blalock and [[Helen Taussig]] in developing and conducting the first successful [[blue baby syndrome|blue baby operation]]. Black students and professionals were rare at Johns Hopkins Institutions and Maryland's state medical societies until after the 1940s. Diversity increased only in the 1960s and 1970s. African-Americans and women were labeled &quot;The Uninvited&quot; in the second major history of the university.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

====Women====
Hopkins' most wellâknown battle for women's rights was the one led by daughters of trustees of the university; [[Mary Garrett|Mary E. Garrett]], [[M. Carey Thomas]], Mamie Gwinn, Elizabeth King, and Julia Rogers.&lt;ref name=women&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/1107web/women2.html |title=&quot;A Timeline of Women at Hopkins&quot; |publisher=Jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They donated and raised the funds needed to open the medical school, and required Hopkins' officials to agree to their stipulation that women would be admitted. Unfortunately, this stipulation applied only to the medical school. Other graduate schools were opened to women by president [[Ira Remsen]] only in 1907. [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]] was the first woman to earn a [[PhD]] at Hopkins, in mathematics in 1882. The trustees denied her the degree and refused to change the policy about admitting women; she finally received her degree 44 years later. In 1893 Florence Bascomb became the university's first female PhD.&lt;ref name=women/&gt;

The [[nursing school]] opened in 1889 and accepted women and men as students.

The decision to admit women at undergraduate level was not considered until the late 1960s and was eventually adopted in October 1969; in the fall of 1970, 90 females, five of them African-American, became undergraduates. In the academic year 1970â1971, 4.7% of students in the Arts and Sciences programs were women. In the year 1985â1986 the proportion of female students in the Arts and Sciences programs had increased to around 38%. As of 2009â2010, the undergraduate population was 47% female and 53% male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.ucan-network.org/jhu |publisher=Ucan-network.org]|title= Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The President is JHU's chief executive officer, and the university is organized into nine academic divisions.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;

==Campus environmental initiatives==

Johns Hopkins University has implemented a number of [[sustainability]] initiatives.&lt;ref name='2008 JHU Sustainability Initiatives'&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 JHU Sustainability Initiatives|url=http://www.sustainability.jhu.edu/index.html|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the ''Sustainable Endowments Institute'' gave Johns Hopkins a  College Sustainability Report Card grade of &quot;C+.&quot; In particular the Institute criticized JHU for failing to disclose its endowment's holdings and proxy voting record on environmental issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sustainable Endowments Institute Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =College Sustainability Report Card 2011 | publisher =Sustainable Endowments Institute | url =http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/johns-hopkins-university|accessdate = 2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
In 2007 carbon emissions were inventoried and electric vehicles were used for some campus transportation needs.

===Food===
As of 2007 dining services managers sought locallyâsourced produce and seafood, and integrated organic food into menus.&lt;ref name='2007-sustainability-report' /&gt; In addition, the smaller cafÃ©s around campus sell exclusively organic, shadeâgrown coffees. A small pilot composting program operated on the undergraduate campus.&lt;ref name='2007-sustainability-report' /&gt;

===Buildings===
In 2007 the university was pursuing [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification for several buildings.&lt;ref name='2007-sustainability-report' /&gt; Energy retrofits in certain buildings have resulted in over 50% less energy consumption.&lt;ref name='2007-sustainability-report'&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 National Sustainability Report|url=http://www.endowmentinstitute.org/sustainability/CollegeSustainabilityReportCard.pdf|publisher=Endowments Institute of America |year=2007|accessdate=2007-01-24|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retrofits included a green roof, experimentation with waterless [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s and low-flow shower heads, and upgraded [[fluorescent]] lighting that reduced electricity for lighting on one campus by over 40 percent. Similar lighting retrofits were underway at all campuses.

===Water===
In 2004, one campus completed a water conservation retrofit that annually saved over {{convert|8000000|usgal|l}} of water.&lt;ref name='2007-sustainability-report' /&gt;

===Student support===
As of 2010 students contributed significantly to environmental initiatives, setting up the JHU recycling program, hosting a national &quot;Greening&quot; conference, launching a transportation shuttle service between campuses and making the campus more bike-friendly.&lt;ref name='2008 JHU Sustainability Initiatives'&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 JHU Sustainability Initiatives|url=http://www.sustainability.jhu.edu/student_groups.html|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|year=2008|accessdate=2008-05-25}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, students conduct the &quot;S.E.X.:I.T.&quot; competition to see which dormitory can save the most electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainability.jhu.edu/student%20programs/dorm_competitions.html|title=Dorm Competitions|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Johns Hopkins entity is structured as two corporations, the university and The Johns Hopkins Health System, formed in 1986. The latter has grown to be the bigger entity, with fiscal year 2005 consolidated net revenue of $3.3 billion, employing 27,700 people, including some 4,700 fullâtime physicians.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trustees.jhu.edu/overview.php|title=JHU Board of Trustees Overview|accessdate=2010â11â19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JHU's bylaws specify a Board of Trustees of between 18 and 65 voting members. Trustees serve sixâyear terms subject to a twoâterm limit. The alumni select 12 trustees. Four recent alumni serve 4-year terms, one per year, typically from the graduating class. The bylaws prohibit students, faculty or administrative staff from serving on the Board, except the President as an exâofficio trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trustees.jhu.edu/bylaws.php|title=Bylaws|accessdate=2010â11â19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Johns Hopkins Health System has a separate Board of Trustees, many of whom are doctors or health care executives. Some JHU Trustees also serve on the Johns Hopkins Health System Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/johns_hopkins_medicine_adds_four_to_board_of_trustees|title=Johns Hopkins Medicine Adds Four to Board|accessdate=2010â11â19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the selectivity of Johns Hopkins University has also increased.  [[Early Decision]] is an option at Johns Hopkins University for students who wish to demonstrate that the university is their first choice.  These students, if admitted, are required to enroll.  This application is due November 1.  Most students do, however, apply Regular Decision which is a traditional non-binding round.  These applications are due January 1 and students are notified April 1.

Mason Library and Bologna Center Library), the R.E. Gibson Library at the Applied Physics Laboratory Library and other minor satellite locations, as well as the archives.
[[File:JHU Eisenhower Library.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Milton S. Eisenhower Library]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
The [[Milton S. Eisenhower Library]], located on the [[Homewood campus]], is the main library. It was built in the 1960s. It houses over 2.6 million volumes and over 20,000 journal subscriptions. The Eisenhower Library is a member of the university's Sheridan Libraries encompassing collections at the Albert D. Hutzler Reading Room (called &quot;The Hut&quot; by students) in Gilman Hall, the John Work Garrett Library at Evergreen House, and the George Peabody Library at Mount Vernon Place. Together these collections provide the major research library resources for the university, serving Johns Hopkins academic programs worldwide. The library was named for [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], former president of the university and brother of former U.S. president [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. JHU's library was originally housed in Gilman Hall, and the library stacks in that building continue to house certain collections.&lt;ref name=gil&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.jhu.edu/jhumag/0206web/halls.html|title=If These Halls Could Talk|work=Johns Hopkins Magazine|first=Maria |last=Blackburn |date=February 2006|accessdate=2010-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two of the Eisenhower library's six stories are above ground, though architects designed the building so that every level has windows and natural light. The design accords with a bit of traditional campus lore which says no structure can be taller than Gilman Hall, the oldest academic building, although no written rule limits building height. In December 2008, an addition directly to the south of the library was announced. The six-and-a-half-story expansion will be named the Brody Learning Commons in honor of University President [[William R. Brody]] and will function as a &quot;collaborative learning space&quot;. It is scheduled to be completed by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins Gazette|url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/2008/08dec08/08blc.html| publisher = Johns Hopkins University|year=2008|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The opportunity to participate in important research is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Hopkins' undergraduate education. About 80 percent of undergraduates perform independent research, often alongside top researchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins News Release â JHU|url=http://jhuniverse.jhu.edu/news_info/news/home01/apr01/wood.html|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|year= 2001|accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2009, Johns Hopkins received $1.856 billion in federal research grantsâmore than any other US university.&lt;ref name=nsf09/&gt; Thirty-three (33) [[Nobel Prize]] winners have been affiliated with the university as alumni or faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webapps.jhu.edu/JHUniverse/information_about_hopkins/facts_and_statistics/nobel_prize_winners/index.cfm |title=The Johns Hopkins University: Nobel Prize Winners |publisher=Webapps.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; JHU views its academic strengths as being in art history, biological, physical and other natural sciences, biomedical engineering, creative writing, English, history, economics, international studies, medicine, music, neuroscience, nursing, political theory, public health, public policy, and the [[Romance languages]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Between 1999 and 2009, Johns Hopkins was among the most cited institutions in the world. It attracted nearly 1,222,166 citations and produced 54,022 papers under its name, ranking &lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;3 globally behind [[Harvard University]] and [[Max Planck Society]] with the highest total citations published in Thomson Reuters-indexed journals over 22 fields in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScienceWatch.com&quot;/&gt;

In FY 2000, Johns Hopkins received $95.4 million in research grants from the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), making it the leading recipient of NASA [[research and development]] funding.&lt;ref name=JHU_NASA_R&amp;D_2000&gt;{{cite news|title=JHU #1 recipient of [[NASA]] research grants: &quot;Dollars From Heaven: NASA-funded research small but vital&quot;|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/localnews/20030217research0217p2.asp|work=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2009-06-25 | first1=Byron | last1=Spice | date=2003-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2002, Hopkins became the first university to cross the $1 billion threshold on either list, recording $1.14 billion in total research and $1.023 billion in federally sponsored research. In FY 2008, Johns Hopkins University performed $1.68 billion in science, medical and engineering research, making it the leading U.S. academic institution in total R&amp;D spending for the 30th year in a row, according to a  [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) ranking.&lt;ref name=ascribe_oct09_r&amp;d&gt;{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins First in R&amp;D Expenditures for 30th Year|url=http://newswire.ascribe.org/cgi-bin/behold.pl?ascribeid=20091006.062525&amp;time=07%2056%20PDT&amp;year=2009&amp;public=0|work=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; These totals include grants and expenditures of JHU's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.&lt;ref name=nsf09/&gt;

==Johns Hopkins University Press==
{{Main|Johns Hopkins University Press}}

The Johns Hopkins University Press is the publishing division of the Johns Hopkins University. It was founded in 1878 and holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously running [[university press]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Press |url=http://www.press.jhu.edu/about/index.html |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |accessdate={{Date|2006-01-14|mdy}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date the Press has published more than 6,000 titles and currently publishes 65 scholarly periodicals and over 200 new books each year. Since 1993, the Johns Hopkins University Press has run [[Project MUSE]], an online collection of over 250 fullâtext, peerâreviewed journals in the humanities and social sciences. The Press also houses the Hopkins Fulfilment Services (HFS), which handles distribution for a number of university presses and publishers. Taken together, the three divisions of the PressâBooks, Journals (including MUSE) and HFSâmake it one of the largest of America's university presses.

==Student life==
[[File:JHUQuad.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Students gather under the holidays lights at the yearly Lighting of the Quad, a Hopkins tradition&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Johns Hopkins Student Government Association represents undergraduates in campus issues and projects. It is elected annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhusga.com/aboutus|title=About Us|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2010â11â24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blueprints for a new programming board called The Hopkins Organization for Programming (&quot;The HOP&quot;) were drawn up during the summer and fall of 2006.

In addition [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Charles Village]], the region of North Baltimore surrounding the university, has undergone several restoration projects, and the university has gradually bought the property around the school for additional student housing and dormitories. ''The Charles Village Project'', scheduled for completion in 2008, brought new commercial spaces to the neighborhood. The project included Charles Commons, a new, modern residence hall that includes popular retail franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Commons|accessdate=2006â08â07|url=http://www.jhu.edu/hds/campushousing/charlescommons.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060910004805/http://www.jhu.edu/hds/campushousing/charlescommons.htm |archivedate = September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einsteinbros.com/index.cfm Einsteinbros.com]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins invested in improving campus life with an arts complex in 2001, the Mattin Center, and a threeâstory sports facility, the O'Connor Recreation Center. The large onâcampus dining facilities at Homewood were renovated in the summer of 2006.

Quality of life is enriched by the proximity of neighboring academic institutions, including [[Loyola College in Maryland|Loyola College]], [[Maryland Institute College of Art|Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA)]], [[UMBC]], [[Goucher College]], and [[Towson University]], as well as nearby [[Inner Harbor]].

Annually, the Johns Hopkins Spring Fair is held on the Homewood campus over a three day weekend in mid to late April. Food, arts and crafts, and nonâprofit vendors, along with a popular musical act and various other activities attract nearly 25,000 people from the greater BaltimoreâWashington area. The Spring Fair is the largest entirely studentârun fair in the country.

===Housing===

[[File:JHU Campus Map.JPG|300px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Johns Hopkins University Campus, Schematic&lt;/center&gt;]]
Living on campus is required for first- and second-year students, except for commuter students who live with a parent or legal guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johns Hopkins Freshman Room Selection Brochure|url=http://home_at_hopkins.jhu.edu/flipbook/FreshmenBrochure/FRSPBrochure2011/index.html|work=Johns Hopkins University Housing and Dining Department|publisher=Johns Hopkins|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Housing is not guaranteed for juniors or seniors at Johns Hopkins.

Freshmen housing is centered around Freshman Quad which consists of three major residence hall complexes: The Alumni Memorial Residences (AMR I and AMR II), Building A and Building B.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshman Residence Halls&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhu.edu/hds/incoming_frosh/explore_residence_halls.html|title=Our Residence Halls|work=Johns Hopkins University Housing and Dining Department|publisher=Johns Hopkins|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMR I was built in 1923 and includes Royce, Sylvester, Vincent, Willard, Wilson and Wood houses; AMR II in 1954, holding Adams, Baker, Clark, Gildersleeve, Griffin, Hollander, Jennings, Lazear houses.{{cn|date=October 2011}} The houses were named for Hopkins Alumni who died in World Wars I and II. While each house has its own outside entrance, there are no dividers indoors that distinguish them. In 1983, Buildings A and B were added to Freshmen Quad.{{cn|date=October 2011}} They have not yet been dedicated. Freshmen are also housed in Wolman Hall and the terrace floor of McCoy Hall, located on the other side of North Charles Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshman Residence Halls&quot;/&gt;

Freshman enter a housing lottery in their spring semester to determine where they will live during their sophomore year. Juniors and seniors may choose between entering the campus housing lottery or moving into nearby apartments or row houses. They occupy one of four buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshman Room Selection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home_at_hopkins.jhu.edu/flipbook/FreshmenBrochure/FRSPBrochure2011/index.html|title=Freshman Room Selection Brochure|work=Johns Hopkins University Housing and Dining Department|publisher=Johns Hopkins|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, McCoy Hall, is located next to Wolman Hall on North Charles Street. McCoy Hall is predominantly composed of sophomores and transfer students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oncampus: Buildings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhu.edu/hds/oncampus/buildings.html|title=Oncampus: Buildings|work=Johns Hopkins University Housing and Dining Department|publisher=Johns Hopkins|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apartment-style housing is offered in the Bradford Apartments, one block east of campus on St. Paul Street, and in the Homewood Apartments, two blocks south on North Charles Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freshman Room Selection&quot;/&gt; The last is Charles Commons, the newest and largest universityâowned dormitory, located at the corner of North Charles and East 33rd. It was completed in 2006 to house 618 students and represented a major step by the university towards offering onâcampus housing to students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oncampus: Buildings&quot;/&gt; Charles Commons consists of two 11âstory towers connected by a bridge, residential suites and features a ballroom, fitness center and several conference rooms. Nolan's on 33rd, a dining hall specializing in dinner services, is also located in the building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oncampus: Buildings&quot;/&gt;

JHU rents several buildings on North Charles Street to house students when necessary. At full capacity, dormitory buildings can house approximately 60% of undergraduates.{{cn|date=October 2011}} Privatelyâowned apartment buildings around Homewood are usually filled with Hopkins upperclassmen, so despite the lack of universityâowned dormitories, housing is available.

===Fraternities and Sororities===
The University Office of Greek Life recognizes thirteen fraternities and eight sororities, which include approximately 25% of the student body. Greek life has been a part of the university culture since 1877, when [[Beta Theta Pi]] fraternity became the first to form a chapter on campus. Sororities arrived at Hopkins in 1982. As with all Hopkins programs, Greek discrimination on the basis of &quot;marital status, pregnancy, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status&quot; is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.jhu.edu/administration/jhuoie/compliance.html|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|title=Equity Compliance and Education|accessdate=2010â11â27}}&lt;/ref&gt; JHU also has an antiâhazing policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.jhu.edu/studentlife/greek_life/hazingpolicy.html|title=Hazing Information|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2010â11â27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prohibits alcohol at recruitment activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.jhu.edu/studentlife/greek_life/InterfraternityCouncil/ifcrushrules07.html|title=IFC Recruitment Rules|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2010â11â27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins does not permit &quot;cityâwide&quot; chapters, and requires all members of a JHU recognized fraternity or sorority to be a JHU student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.jhu.edu/studentlife/greek_life/greeklifepolicies.html|title=Office of Greek Life Policies|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|accessdate=2010â11â27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of Spring 2011, 1,208 students were members of one of Hopkins' fraternities or sororities. The AllâGreek Average [[GPA]] was 3.31, above the undergraduate average GPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turning|first=Robert|title=Greek Grade Information, Spring 2011|publisher=Office of Student Development and Programming, Johns Hopkins University|year=2011|accessdate=2011â10â09|url= http://web.jhu.edu/studentlife/greek_life/GradeInformation/greekgradesspring11.html}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spring 2010 the university was considering construction of a &quot;fraternity row&quot; of houses to consolidate the groups on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2010/11/18/NewsFeatures/Hopkins.Greek.Life.Considers.Fraternity.Rowâ3961579.shtml|title=Hopkins Greek Life considers fraternity row|first=Megan|last=Cants|work=The Johns Hopkins NewsâLetter|date=November 18. 2010|accessdate=2010â11â24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Johns Hopkins fraternities and sororities belong to one of four Councils: the '''InterâFraternity Council''', the '''[[National Panhellenic Conference]]''', the '''[[National Pan-Hellenic Council]]''' and the '''Multicultural Council'''.

The InterâFraternity Council includes eleven fraternities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.jhu.edu/studentlife/greek_life/InterfraternityCouncil/inter_fraternity.html|title=

[[Delta Phi]] Fraternity, also known as St. Elmo's, maintains a chapter exclusive to students at Johns Hopkins, though it is not recognized by the Office of Greek Life.

Unrecognized [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] and [[Delta Sigma Theta]] AfricanâAmerican interest sororities often recruit Johns Hopkins undergraduates, in their cityâwide chapters. [[Delta Sigma Theta]] was the first '''National PanâHellenic Council''' member to charter on the campus in 1976, as well as the first sorority of any kind on the JHU campus.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Kappa Alpha Theta]], a [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) sorority, was disbanded by its national headquarters on April 14, 2009 after twelve years on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Patnaik|first=Payal|title=Theta to be disbanded indefinitely|publisher=Johns Hopkins NewsâLetter|date=2009â04â16|accessdate=2009â05â21|url=http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2009/04/16/NewsFeatures/Theta.To.Be.Disbanded.Indefinitelyâ3713697.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal was due to repeated risk management violations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Recruitment for InterâFraternity Council and Panhellenic Conference fraternities and sororities takes place during the spring semester for freshmen, though some groups recruit upperclassmen during the fall semester.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} All participants must have completed one semester and must be in good academic standing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Many of the fraternities maintain houses off campus, but no sororities do.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  Baltimore City allows housing to be zoned specifically for use as a fraternity or sorority house, but in practice this zoning code has not been awarded for at least 50 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Only Sigma Phi Epsilon's building has this zoning code due to its consistent ownership since the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baltimore Zoning Laws&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transformbaltimore.net/portal/zoningâaprâdraft?pointId=1273165766647 |title=Baltimore Zoning Law |publisher=Baltimore City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student publications===
[[File:GilmanHall.JPG|right|upright|thumb||200px|&lt;center&gt;Gilman Hall, Center for the Humanities&lt;/center&gt;]]
Hopkins has many student publications.
*''[[The Johns Hopkins News-Letter]]'', founded in 1896, is one of the oldest continuously published weekly college newspapers in the nation with a press run of 5,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jhunewsletter.com/home/generalinformation/ |title=The Johns Hopkins NewsâLetter |publisher=Jhunewsletter.com |date= |accessdate=2010â11â24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The News-Letter won a Associated Collegiate Press Newspaper Pacemaker award for fourâyear, nonâdaily college newspapers in 2007.
