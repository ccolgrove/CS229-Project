'''Info-ZIP''' is a set of [[open-source software]] to handle [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP archives]].  It has been in circulation since 1989.  It consists of 4 separately-installable packages: the '''Zip''' and '''UnZip''' command-line utilities; and '''WiZ''' and '''MacZip''', which are [[graphical user interface]]s for archiving programs in [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[MacOS Classic|classic MacOS]], respectively.

Info-ZIP's Zip and UnZip have been [[ported]] to dozens of [[computing platform]]s.  The UnZip web page describes UnZip as &quot;The Third Most Portable Program in the World&quot;, surpassed by [[Hello World]], [[C-Kermit]], and possibly the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html | title = Info-ZIP's UnZip | first = Greg | last = Roelofs | date = 2009-09-10 | accessdate = 2010-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;zip&quot; and &quot;unzip&quot; programs included with most Linux and Unix distributions are Info-ZIP's Zip and UnZip.

In addition to the Info-ZIP releases themselves, parts of Info-ZIP, including [[zlib]], have been used in numerous other [[file archiver]]s and other programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;iz-home&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.info-zip.org/ | title = Info-ZIP Home Page | first = Greg | last = Roelofs | date = 2008-07-08 | accessdate = 2010-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Info-ZIP programmers have also been involved in other projects closely related to the [[DEFLATE]] compression algorithm, such as the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] image format and the [[zlib]] software library.&lt;ref name=&quot;iz-more&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.info-zip.org/Info-ZIP2.html | title = Info-ZIP: More Stuff | first = Greg | last = Roelofs | date = 2008-10-04 | accessdate = 2010-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The UnZip package also includes three additional utilities:
* '''fUnZip''' extracts a file in a ZIP or [[gzip]] file directly to output from archives or other [[pipe (computing)|piped]] input.
* '''UnZipSFX''' is software to make a ZIP file into an executable [[self-extracting archive]].
* '''ZipInfo''' outputs, in a variety of formats, information about ZIP files and their contents.

The Zip package includes three additional utilities:
* '''ZipCloak''' adds or removes password encryption from file in a ZIP archive.
* '''ZipNote''' allows the modification of comment fields in ZIP archives.
* '''ZipSplit''' splits a ZIP archive into sections for separate disks or downloads.

==History==
The first version of UnZip was released by Samuel M. Smith in March 1989, with [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[C (programming language)|C]] versions.  Pascal was abandoned soon after.  Smith's UnZip 2.0, in September, included support for the &quot;unimploding&quot; (method 6) as in [[PKZIP]] 1.01.  Carl Mascott and John Cowan released UnZip 2.0a in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;iz-more&quot;/&gt;

In Spring 1990, Info-ZIP was formed as a [[mailing list]] on [[SIMTEL20]], and released UnZip 3.0.  In December, UnZip 4.0, with ZIP file &quot;central directory&quot; support, was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;iz-more&quot;/&gt;

UnZip 5.0 and Zip 1.9 were released in August 1992; these are the first Info-ZIP programs to support the new [[DEFLATE]] (method 8) compression method used in [[PKZIP]] 1.93a.&lt;ref name=&quot;iz-more&quot;/&gt;  Method 8 has become the de facto base standard for ZIP archives.

In 1994 and 1995 Info-ZIP turned a corner, and effectively became the ''de facto'' ZIP program on non-[[MS-DOS]] systems. A huge number of ports were released that year, including numerous [[minicomputer]]s, [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] and practically every [[microcomputer]] ever developed.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

WiZ 4.0 was released in November 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;iz-more&quot;/&gt;

The first times Info-ZIP released versions under the new [[BSD-like license|BSD-like]] Info-ZIP License were Zip 2.3 in December 1999 and UnZip 5.41 and WiZ 5.01 in April 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;iz-more&quot;/&gt;

The first MacZip (1.05) was released in July 2000; the last version was 1.06, released in February 2001.  It was written by Dick Hasse.&lt;ref name=&quot;iz-more&quot;/&gt;

General [[Deflate64]] (method 9) decompression was introduced with UnZip 5.50, whose main release was in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title = UnZip, version 5.5, 17 February 2002 | first = Christian | last = Spieler | date = 2002-02-17 | work = UNZPHIST.ZIP | publisher = Info-ZIP | accessdate = 2010-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UnZip 6.0 includes &quot;Zip64&quot; large file support and bzip2-method (method 12) decompression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title = README | work = Zip | version = 6.10a | date = 2010-08-13 | publisher = Info-ZIP }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Support for bzip2-style compression was also in Zip from 3.0f beta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title = WHATSNEW | work = Zip | version = 3.1c | date = 2010-06-20 | publisher = Info-ZIP }}&lt;/ref&gt;
