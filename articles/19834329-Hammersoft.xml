This is an almost complete list of the '''main characters of ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'' season 2'''. The series went through significant cast changes after every season it was on the air. This list contains only those characters that were given credit in the main titles of the second season (therefore, does not contain characters such as [[List_of_recurring_characters_on_seaQuest_DSV#William_Noyce|Admiral Noyce]] (which is located at [[List of recurring characters on seaQuest DSV]]) or characters who first appeared in the first season such as [[Main characters of seaQuest DSV season 1#Commander Jonathan Ford|Commander Jonathan Ford]] (which is located at [[Main characters of seaQuest DSV season 1]]).

Wendy came aboard the ''[[seaQuest DSV 4600|seaQuest DSV 4600 II]]'' in 2021 after the first ''seaQuest'' had been destroyed by [[Nathan Bridger|Captain Nathan Bridger]] the previous year in an attempt to seal a lava pool that threatened to melt the world's [[polar caps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;higherpower&quot;&gt;[[Higher Power (seaQuest DSV episode)|seaQuest episode 124: Higher Power]]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Kristin Westphalen|Dr. Kristin Westphalen]] elected not to sign aboard the new ''seaQuest'', Dr. Smith won the most coveted medical position in the [[UEO]] that of the chief medical officer of the flagship.

A doctor of all trades, Wendy only took her residency in [[psychiatry]]; with a [[Ph.D]] in [[biophysics]]; although her passion was [[parapsychology]]. Discovering that she had a high psi-factor as a child, Wendy found that she could sense the thoughts and emotions of the people around her. Calling it her &quot;[[telepathy|sixth sense]]&quot;, she sometimes wished she didn't have the talent, but usually used it to her advantage, although, she swore that she never probed anyone's thoughts without their permission.&lt;ref name=&quot;daggers&quot;&gt;[[Daggers (seaQuest DSV episode)|seaQuest episode 201: Daggers]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wendy came from a navy family with both her mother and grandmother serving. Captain Bridger had, not only served under her mother, Lexington Fisher-Smith (aka &quot;Sexy-Lexy Smith&quot;), but also pursued a brief romantic involvement with her before ultimately ending the relationship. However, Bridger's prior interest in her mother didn't stop the captain from developing feelings for Wendy. At first, Wendy resisted the relationship and considered transferring off of ''seaQuest'' due to the scandal a relationship with the ship's captain would no doubt present, but, after convincing from both Bridger and [[Lucas Wolenczak]], Wendy decided to remain aboard the ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;vapors&quot;&gt;[[Vapors (seaQuest DSV episode)|seaQuest episode 205: Vapors]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to her relationship with Bridger, Wendy had engaged in a relationship with Clay Marshall, director of a parapsychology facility, who helped her develop her telepathic sense, however, the relationship eventually ended. When [[Tony Piccolo (seaQuest DSV)|Tony Piccolo]] and [[Dagwood (seaQuest DSV)|Dagwood]] mysteriously shared a nightmare, Wendy took them to be examined by Marshall. However, Clay had been cybernetically augmented in the years following their relationship and required sentium available in the ''seaQuest'''s missiles as blood. Desperate to get the material, Marshall used his previous relationship with Smith to help gain access to the ''seaQuest'', however, he was ultimately foiled
On May 14, 2022, Wendy, along with the rest of the ''seaQuest'' crew were transported to the far distant planet Hyperion, tricked into becoming participants in the Hyperion civil war. Wendy was part of the away team sent from ''seaQuest'' to destroy the KrayTak mothership and was able to cofirm that Tobias LeConte, who had been captured by the KrayTaks, was the genuine article, not a Stormer clone. With the ''seaQuest'' hulled by a barrier mine and their shuttle destroyed, the team looked to be doomed. With no other choice, Captain Bridger activated explosive charges and destroyed the mothership, taking the away team with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;splashdown&quot;&gt;[[Splashdown (seaQuest DSV episode)|seaQuest episode 221: Splashdown]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Hyperion rebels were somehow able to save the majority of the ''seaQuest'' crew, as well as repair the critical damage to the ship and return them all to Earth, it's assumed that Smith was not able to be saved and ultimately perished on Hyperion though her character is never referred to by name.&lt;ref name=&quot;bravenewworld&quot;&gt;[[Brave New World (seaQuest 2032 episode)|seaQuest episode 301: Brave New World]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Background====
Dr. Smith was portrayed by actress [[Rosalind Allen]] and was [[Stephanie Beacham]]'s replacement after she opted not to return for the second season of the show. Allen's character has been a point of criticism from many fans of the show as her character's psychic and telepathic abilities helped to push ''seaQuest DSV'' away from reality based fiction to heavy science-fiction.

The character of Dr. Smith was originally two different characters; Diane Page, a 35 year old [[African American]] [[Ph.D]] and Wendy Woo, a 25 year old [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]. The producers of the show originally wanted [[Tamara Tunie]] and [[Kelly Hu]] respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;seaQuest: Year II writers guide&quot;&gt;seaQuest: Year II writers guide&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kathy Evison]] originally auditioned for the role of Dr. Smith. Although she didn't get the role of Dr. Smith, the producers liked her and created a new character, Lonnie Henderson, for her to play.

The episode &quot;[[Alone (seaQuest DSV episode)|Alone]]&quot;, which focused extensively on Dr. Smith's powers, infuriated actor [[Edward Kerr]] (Brody) to the point that he stormed off the set and did not appear in the episode.

Allen's character was eventually written out of the series at the end of the second season as the series began to progress back towards more reality based episodes in the third season.

When Brody was six years old, his mother was involved in a murder cover-up at the (accidental) hands of [[List_of_recurring_characters_on_seaQuest_DSV#Franklin Main Characters of seaQuest DSV season 2Frank.22_Gideon_Thomas|Franklin Thomas]]. Contracting the P-Core A virus, Brody's mother was place in cryogenic suspension and he was sent to live with his grandparents, who &quot;let (him) get away with murder.&lt;ref name=&quot;whenwedeadawaken&quot;&gt;seaQuest episode 209: When We Dead Awaken&lt;/ref&gt; After joining the navy, Brody led a stealth invasion during the North Korean Crisis in 2010, which [[Nathan Bridger|Captain Bridger]] considered to be a &quot;nifty piece of work.&quot;

Assigned to the G.E.L.F. colony prison island, Brody began to sense subtle changes in the behavior of the G.E.L.F.s, finally culminating in their uprising and seizure of the colony. Brody, however, was able to escape and was picked up by the ''[[seaQuest DSV 4600|seaQuest]]'', after which the crisis had ended, he joined the crew as tactical officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;daggers&quot;/&gt; As tactical officer, Brody led most away missions into hostile environments and manned the weapons console when [[Commander Jonathan Ford|Commander Ford]] was in command.

When Brody's mother awoke from her cryogenic suspension, she sought out her son, who took her aboard the ''seaQuest'' to shield her away from assassins plotting to kill her, hired by General Thomas, to protect his career. Ultimately, Brody was able to apprehend Thomas, allowing his mother to return to cryo-stasis, secure in the knowledge that when she awoke again, she would have nothing to fear. He also promised his mother that he would be with her again when she was revived.&lt;ref name=&quot;whenwedeadawaken&quot;/&gt;

When the ''seaQuest'' was abducted to the planet Hyperion in 2022, Brody was wounded while part of an away team sent into the Hyperion mothership intent on destroying it. Brody, along with the rest of the away team, were apparently destroyed along with the ship after Captain Bridger detonated an explosive attached to the ship's plasma core, but was able to be rescued by the Hyperion rebels and returned to Earth with the majority of the crew by the year 2032.&lt;ref name=&quot;splashdown&quot;/&gt; 

Brody butted heads with the ''seaQuest'''s new captain, Oliver Hudson, played by [[Michael Ironside]], who apparently favored his personal student, [[Characters of seaQuest 2032#Lieutenant J.J. Fredericks|Lieutenant Fredericks]], over Brody. However, when [[Characters of seaQuest 2032#Alexander_Bourne|President Alexander Bourne]] and [[Characters of seaQuest 2032#Larry_Deon|Larry Deon]] conspired to gain control of Fredericks' psyche-implant, Brody was able to learn the truth and inform Captain Hudson, saving both Fredericks and [[List_of_recurring_characters_on_seaQuest_DSV#Secretary General Arthur McGath|Secretary General McGath]], whom she was being manipulated to assassinate.&lt;ref name=&quot;brainlock&quot;&gt;seaQuest episode 311: Brainlock&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point in his life, Brody sired a child with a woman. However, being a career-military and a private man, Brody never told any of the ''seaQuest'' crew of that aspect of his life. He himself only found out about the then 10 year old child after the ship returned from Hyperion and the mother of the child decided to contact him after one of her parents had recently died.&lt;ref name=&quot;spindrift&quot;&gt;seaQuest episode 306: SpinDrift&lt;/ref&gt;

Brody ultimately died later that year in a rescue mission to save Lieutenant Henderson from a Macronesian death sentence. His last words were'' &quot;With your shield or on it.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;spindrift&quot;/&gt;

====Background====
Brody was played by [[Edward Kerr]] and was named after Police Chief Martin Brody (played by [[Roy Scheider]]) in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]].'' Brody was Chief Crocker's replacement, both on the show and on the ship (after [[Royce D. Applegate]] was released from the show and Chief Crocker retired from the navy). Kerr was not fond with the content of the episode &quot;[[Alone (seaQuest DSV episode)|Alone]]&quot; and refused to appear in it. Frustrated with the direction of the show and afraid that the series would hurt his career, Kerr requested to exit the show along with Scheider. NBC granted him his release as well, under the provision that he continue to play Brody for a few episodes into the third season so his character could be killed off for dramatic impact.

The two actors originally considered for the role of Brody were [[Dan Gauthier]] and [[Paul Gross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;seaQuest: Year II writers guide&quot;/&gt;

Anthony Piccolo first boarded the seaQuest as a [[Seaman]] in the episode [[Daggers (seaQuest DSV episode)|Daggers]], the first seaQuest DSV episode of the Second Season.
He was an experimental ex con, let out from prison on an early release program where they conducted science experiments on volunteers. Piccolo was offered and then received a pair of genetically altered [[gills]], allowing him to breathe underwater like a fish. He was put on seaQuest because that's where the parole board thought he would be most useful. 

At first he was rebellious, and attempted escape shortly after boarding, but soon was bunked with [[Lucas Wolenczak]], and though they first irritated one another, they soon became friends. Piccolo was originally from [[New York]] and his wise crack Italian humor often relieved tense situations and gained him popularity, though he was often teased light heartedly among the crew. He enjoyed showing off his talents in gambling and playing the piano, and was a big Elvis fan. 

He also was [[dyslexic]] which caused him to struggle when he decided to apply for the [[Officer Candidate School]], in the third season of seaQuest. Lt Lonnie Henderson, who had already passed the program, tutored him. Although he didn't pass the test Capt. Hudson was impressed with the effort he put into it and promoted him to the rank of [[Warrant Officer]], which let him continue to qualify for Sub Fighter training under Lt. Fredericks.

====Background====
Tony Piccolo was played by [[Michael DeLuise]]. In the first season Lucas had a little brother relationship with Krieg, for this season Lucas became the mentor to Piccolo, and empathized on his family problems since he too came from a broken family. One of Picollos most important aspects, according to Producer [[Carleton Eastlake]], is &quot;heÂ´s also the most human of the whole crew, because heÂ´s really very unsophisticated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seaquestdsv.tv-series.com/default.asp?ModuleID=2&amp;PageID=12&amp;ArticleID=50795 Altered Voyages]&lt;/ref&gt; DeLuise was on the original short list for the part of Piccolo, along with [[Max Perlich]].

Lieutenant Lenore &quot;Lonnie&quot; Ellen Henderson signed aboard the ''seaQuest DSV-II'' as a helmsman in 2021. As a first generation naval officer, she was a bit rough around the edges in terms of proper protocol. She successfully was able to smuggle her stuffed bear Addison aboard ''seaQuest'', much to the consternation of Commander Ford.

Henderson initially showed an interest in Lieutenant O'Neill and the two spent some shore leave together. However, O'Neill was uncomfortable dating someone he served with and the two remained just friends. She also offered herself to [[Lucas Wolenczak]] when it was believed that he was going to die in a subterranean cavern. Lonnie was mistaken for [[Minerva]] by [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune, the God of the Sea]]. She was also captured and possessed by an alien Stormer when it hatched itself aboard the ''seaQuest''. The Stormer attempted to use Henderson's form to get close to Professor Tobias LeConte, but, Tobias was able to see through the alien's ruse and Henderson was set free.

When ''seaQuest'' returned to Earth in 2032, she began a romantic relationship with Commander Ford, while simultaneously trying to help Tony Piccolo overcome his dyslexia. This led to jealously between Ford and Piccolo, but, Henderson ultimately chose Ford. In an attempt to save two Spindrift children from Macronesia, Henderson was captured and held prisoner by Macronesia. President Alexander Bourne wanted to use her to humiliate the UEO and allowed her to be put up for execution. She was rescued by a ''seaQuest'' team, but, it cost the life of Lieutenant James Brody.

While on a mission to the Tartarus Federation, Henderson became aware that her first lover, Jason Pardee, appeared to be imprisoned there wrongfully. She attempted to help him, but, in the process, accidentally incited a prison revolt that allowed Mason Freeman and Pardee to take a group of researchers at Osiris Base as well as Ensign Wolenczak and her hostage. In the ensuing escape, Henderson was forced to kill her former lover. The incident shook her faith in love and ended her relationship with Commander Ford.

====Background====
Henderson was portrayed by actress [[Kathy Evison]], who had originally auditioned for the role of Dr. Wendy Smith. While not scoring the role of Dr. Smith, the producers created the role of Henderson for Evison. As a result, her character was not in the first few scripts of season 2 and had to be hastily inserted wherever possible.

Dagwood was the prototype G.E.L.F. He originally did not have a name, but, adopted the name &quot;Dagwood&quot; a joke, since G.E.L.F.s were also known as &quot;Daggers.&quot; Dagwood was the imperfect prototype [[Daggers (seaQuest DSV episode)|Dagger]], intended as [[supersoldier]]s, but, he was reassigned to custodial duties, eventually being placed aboard the new ''seaQuest DSV'' in 2021. He proved his worth to the ''seaQuest'' crew almost immediately when he saved Lieutenant O'Neill's life when a large turbine collapsed on top of him, lifting the immense vent off of him. He was also able to convince Mariah, leader of the G.E.L.F. uprising that the G.E.L.F. baby was in fact a human.

Dagwood was convicted of the murder of his creator and sentenced to life imprisonment. As it turned out, the murder had in fact been perpetrated by another of the G.E.L.F. prototypes that looked identical to him. Dagwood was to destroy his doppelganger and clear his name.

When Captain Hudson assumed command of the ''seaQuest'' in 2032, Dagwood had to again prove his worth to the new captain, as Hudson had decreed that there would be no civilians aboard ''seaQuest.'' He was able to temporarily stop Ben Krieg's attack on the ''seaQuest'' shore party by braving the weapons fire and approaching Krieg personally. Hudson rewarded him with a naval commission and a ''seaQuest'' uniform.

Dagwood was part of the infiltration team led by Captain Bridger to the Macronesian outpost on Banaba Island where a UEO scientist had performed crimes against humanity by experimenting and torturing live G.E.L.F.s. Dagwood was outraged as he had always disbelieved the G.E.L.F. opinion that Humans had tortured his people and ultimately destroyed the remaining research.

====Background====
Dagwood was portrayed by [[Peter DeLuise]]. He had previously portrayed the character &quot;Whiggins&quot; in the first season episode &quot;Whale Song.&quot;
