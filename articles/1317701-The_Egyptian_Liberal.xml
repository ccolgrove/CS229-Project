'''Rachel Anne Maddow''' ({{IPA-en|ËmÃ¦doÊ|pron}}; born April 1, 1973) is an American television host and [[Pundit (expert)|political commentator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;npr081023&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfg090811&quot; /&gt; Maddow hosts a nightly television show, ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', on [[MSNBC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bay070823&quot; /&gt; Her syndicated [[talk radio]] program, ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (radio)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', aired on [[Air America Media|Air America Radio]]. Maddow is the first [[Coming_out|openly gay]] anchor to host a prime-time news program in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;les0809&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lgbtqnews&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;frisky&quot; /&gt;

Asked about her political views by the ''[[Valley Advocate]]'', Maddow replied, &quot;I'm undoubtedly a liberal, which means that I'm in almost total agreement with the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]-era [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] platform.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sturm&quot; /&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Maddow was born in [[Castro Valley, California]]. Her father, Robert B. &quot;Bob&quot; Maddow, is a former [[United States Air Force]] [[Captain (United States)|captain]] who resigned his [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] the year before her birth and found civilian work as a [[attorney at law|lawyer]] for the [[East Bay Municipal Utility District]]. Her mother, Elaine Maddow (nÃ©e Gosse), is a school program administrator from [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;cr081105&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gdiv3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ref09&quot; /&gt; She has one older brother, David. Her father is of [[Russian people|Russian]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent and her mother is of [[English people|English]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref09&quot;/&gt; Maddow's mother was raised a strict [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], and Maddow herself grew up in a community that her mother has described as &quot;very conservative.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xan&quot; /&gt; Maddow was a competitive athlete and played three sports in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-09-11/news/17156737_1_pat-buchanan-buchanan-s-republican-national-convention-radio-network | title=Bay Area's Maddow is cable talk's newest star | last=Garofoli | first=Joe | date=September 11, 2008 | publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referencing [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] films, she describes herself in high school as &quot;a cross between the jock and the antisocial girl.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;xan&quot; /&gt;

A graduate of [[Castro Valley High School]] in Castro Valley, California, Maddow earned a degree in [[Public policy doctrine (conflict of laws)|public policy]] from [[Stanford University]] in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;stan9&quot; /&gt; At graduation she was awarded the John Gardner Fellowship. She was also the recipient of a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and began her postgraduate study in 1995 at [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. In 2001, she earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (DPhil)&lt;!-- please do not change to &quot;PhD&quot; because the institution granting the degree calls it &quot;DPhil&quot; --&gt; in [[politics]] from Oxford University.&lt;ref name=&quot;chief&quot; /&gt; Her thesis is titled ''HIV/AIDS and Health Care Reform in British and American Prisons'' (supervisor: [[Lucia Zedner|Dr Lucia Zedner]]). She was the first [[openly gay]] American to win a Rhodes scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;afterellen&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tg080928&quot; /&gt;

== Radio career ==
Maddow's first radio hosting job was at [[WRNX]] (100.9 FM) in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], after she entered and won a contest the station held to find a new on-air personality.&lt;ref name=&quot;adv040831&quot; /&gt; She was hired to co-host WRNX's morning show, ''The Dave in the Morning Show''. She went on to host ''Big Breakfast'' on [[WRSI]], in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], for two years. She left the show in March 2004 to join the new [[Air America Media|Air America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chief&quot; /&gt; There she hosted ''[[Unfiltered]]'' along with [[Chuck D]] (of the [[hip hop]] group [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]) and [[Lizz Winstead]] (co-creator of ''[[The Daily Show]]''), until its cancellation in March 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;sovo0501&quot; /&gt; Two weeks after the cancellation of ''[[Unfiltered]]'' in April 2005, Maddow's weekday two-hour radio program, ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (radio)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'', began airing; in March 2008 it gained an hour, broadcasting from 6 to 9 p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time|EST]] with [[David Bender]] filling in the third hour for the call-in section, when Maddow was on TV assignment. In September 2008, the show's length returned to two hours when Maddow began a nightly MSNBC television program. In February 2009, after renewing her contract with Air America, Maddow returned to the 5 am hourlong slot.&lt;ref name=&quot;aapr1&quot; /&gt; Her last Air America show was on January 21, 2010, two weeks before its owners filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=&quot;aabank&quot; /&gt;

== Television career ==
In June 2005, Maddow became a regular panelist on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Tucker (television program)|Tucker]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;parn&quot; /&gt; During and after the [[United States elections, 2006|November 2006 election]], she was a frequent guest on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Paula Zahn Now]].'' In January 2008, Maddow was given the position of MSNBC political analyst and was a regular panelist on MSNBC's ''[[1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (TV series)|Race for the White House]]'' with [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] and MSNBC's election coverage,&lt;ref name=bio2008 /&gt; as well as a frequent contributor on ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;chief&quot; /&gt;

In April 2008, Maddow was the substitute host for ''Countdown with Keith Olbermann'', her first time hosting a program on MSNBC. Maddow described herself on air as &quot;nervous.&quot; [[Keith Olbermann]] complimented her work and she was brought back to host &quot;Countdown&quot; in May 2008. The day she hosted was the highest rated news program among people 25 to 54 years of age, a demographic key to ratings.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvn080516&quot; /&gt; For her success, the next Monday Olbermann ranked Maddow third in his show's segment &quot;World's Best Persons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;kobest&quot; /&gt; Maddow filled in again on ''Countdown'' for eight and a half broadcasts while Olbermann was on vacation in July 2008 and the second half of the show on July 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes072008&quot; /&gt; Maddow also filled in for David Gregory as host of ''[[Race for the White House]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;chief&quot; /&gt;

=== ''The Rachel Maddow Show'' ===
{{Main|The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)}}
MSNBC announced in August 2008 ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' would replace ''[[Verdict with Dan Abrams]]'' in the channel's 9 p.m. slot the next month.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap080820a&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt080819b&quot; /&gt; Since its debut, the show has topped ''Countdown'' as the highest rated show on [[MSNBC]] on several occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;hp080918&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt080925d&quot; /&gt; After being on air for more than a month, Maddow's program doubled the audience that hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;ntf&quot; /&gt;

Early reviews for her show were mostly positive. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Matea Gold stated Maddow &quot;finds the right formula on MSNBC,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gold&quot; /&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]'' writes Maddow has become the &quot;star of America's cable news.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tg080928&quot; /&gt; ''[[Associated Press]]'' columnist David Bauder said she's &quot;[Keith] Olbermann's political soul mate&quot; and the Olbermann-Maddow shows are a &quot;liberal two-hour block.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap081026&quot; /&gt;

Distinguishing herself from others on the left, Maddow said she's a &quot;national security liberal&quot; and in a different interview that she's not &quot;a partisan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;steinberg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kurtz&quot; /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called her a &quot;defense policy wonk&quot; who is writing a book on the role of the military in postwar American politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;steinberg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gold&quot; /&gt; During the 2008 presidential election, Maddow did not formally support any candidate. Concerning [[Barack Obama]]'s candidacy, Maddow said during the primaries, &quot;I have never and still don't think of myself as an Obama supporter, either professionally or actually.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nat080818&quot; /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Maddow lives in [[Manhattan]] and western [[Massachusetts]] with her partner, artist Susan Mikula.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bantering&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aabio&quot; /&gt; The couple met in 1999, when Mikula hired Maddow to do yard work at her home. Maddow was working on her doctoral dissertation at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bantering&quot; /&gt; Their first date was at a [[National Rifle Association]] &quot;Ladies' Day on the Range&quot; event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/18/maddow-meghan-mccain-nra_n_810445.html Rachel Maddow Accepts Meghan McCain's Invitation To NRA Convention (VIDEO)], ''[[Huffington Post]]'' (January 18, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Massachusetts and New York recognize same-sex marriage, as of 2009 Maddow and Mikula had no plans to marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;xan&quot; /&gt;

== 2012 Massachusetts Senate race ==
In March 2010, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Scott Brown]], the junior [[United States Senator]] from Massachusetts, speculated that Maddow was going to run against him for his seat in 2012. He used this premise for a fundraising email that read &quot;...The Massachusetts political machine is looking for someone to run against me. And you're not going to believe who they are supposedly trying to recruit&amp;nbsp;â liberal MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow.&quot; Maddow said Brown's speculation was false. On her March 23, 2010, TV program, Maddow said, &quot;I have the best job in the world. I am not running for office. Scott Brown didn't ask me if I was running or planning to run for office, before he wrote a fundraising letter with my name. No, it's completely made up by him.&quot; Despite her comments, the next day Brown continued along the same line, telling a [[Boston]] radio station, &quot;Bring her on.&quot; To help put an end to the matter, Maddow ran a full-page advertisement in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' confirming she was not running, and separately demanded Brown's apology. She added that despite repeated invitations over the months, Brown had refused to appear on her TV program.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brown2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brown3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brown4&quot; /&gt;
