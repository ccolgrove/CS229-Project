The '''Communist Party of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|ÐÐ¾Ð¼Ð¼ÑÐ½Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸ÑÐµÑÐºÐ°Ñ Ð¿Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¡Ð¾Ð²ÐµÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¡Ð¾ÑÐ·Ð°}}, ''Kommunisticheskaya partiya Sovetskogo Soyuza''; short: ÐÐÐ¡Ð¡, ''KPSS'') was the only legal, ruling [[political party]] in the [[Soviet Union]] and one of the largest [[Communist Party|communist organizations]] in the world. It lost its dominance in the wake of the failed [[1991 Soviet coup d'Ã©tat attempt|August 1991 coup d'Ã©tat attempt]] led by [[authoritarian]] hardliners.

It emerged from the [[Bolshevik]] faction of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The party led the 1917 [[October Revolution]] that overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] and established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first]] [[socialist state]]. Given the central role under the [[Constitution of the Soviet Union]], the party controlled all tiers of government in the Soviet Union and tolerated no opposition. Its organization was subdivided into communist parties of the constituent [[Soviet republic]]s as well as the mass youth organization, [[Komsomol]]. The party was also the driving force of the Third International [[Communist International|(Comintern)]].

The party ceased to exist after the coup d'Ã©tat attempt in 1991 and was succeeded by the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] in [[Russian Federation|Russia]] and the communist parties of the now-independent former Soviet republics.

==Names==
* The [[Bolshevik]] [[Political faction|faction]] emerged within the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] as a ''[[de facto]]'' [[Voting bloc|political bloc]] separate from the [[Menshevik]]s in 1903.
* The RSDLP was formally split in 1912, Henceforth, the Bolshevik faction was known as '''Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks)''', '''RSDLP(b)''' ({{lang-ru|Ð Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸ÌÐ¹ÑÐºÐ°Ñ Ð¡Ð¾ÑÐ¸Ð°Ð»-Ð´ÐµÐ¼Ð¾ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ¸ÌÑÐµÑÐºÐ°Ñ Ð Ð°Ð±Ð¾ÌÑÐ°Ñ ÐÐ°ÌÑÑÐ¸Ñ (Ð±Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐµÐ²Ð¸ÐºÐ¾ÌÐ²}}), Ð Ð¡ÐÐ Ð(Ð±)).

With Ukrainian independence coming about with the secession of [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] the Ukrainian element became the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine]] ({{lang-uk|ÐÐ¾Ð¼ÑÐ½ÑÑÑÐ¸ÑÐ½Ð° ÐÐ°ÑÑÑÑ (Ð±ÑÐ»ÑÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸ÐºÑÐ²) Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½Ð¸}} ''Komunistychna Partiya (bilshovykiv) Ukrayiny''). In 1920 the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine]] rejoined the RCP.
* In 1925 the party was renamed the '''All-Union Communist Party''' ({{lang-ru|ÐÑÐµÑÐ¾ÑÌÐ·Ð½Ð°Ñ ÐÐ¾Ð¼Ð¼ÑÐ½Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸ÌÑÐµÑÐºÐ°Ñ ÐÐ°ÌÑÑÐ¸Ñ}}), ÐÐÐ).

[[File:Ð¡ÑÐµÐ·Ð´ ÐÐÐ¡Ð¡ 1986.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Congress Of The Communist Party [[USSR]],(1986)]]
{{Soviet Union sidebar}}
{{Main|Organization of the Communist Party of the USSR}}
The governing body of the CPSU was the [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party Congress]] which was held once in 1â5 years, depending on the historical period, with an exception of a long break from 1939 to 1952. Party Congresses would elect a [[Central Committee]] which, in turn, would elect a [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Under Stalin the most powerful position in the party became the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] who was elected by the Politburo.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott, Stalin: Revolutionary In An Era of War (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006) 41-43.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the title of ''General Secretary'' became ''First Secretary'' and the ''Politburo'' became the ''Presidium'' before reverting to their former names under [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1966.

In theory, supreme power in the party was invested in the Party Congress. However, in practice, all executive power was in the hands of the General Secretary.

At lower levels, the organizational hierarchy was managed by Party Committees, or ''partkoms'' (Ð¿Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼). A partkom was headed by the elected &quot;partkom bureau secretary&quot; (&quot;partkom secretary&quot;, ÑÐµÐºÑÐµÑÐ°ÑÑ Ð¿Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼Ð°). At enterprises, institutions, ''[[kolkhoz]]es'', etc., they were called as such, i.e., &quot;partkoms&quot;. At higher levels the Committees were abbreviated accordingly: ''raikoms'' (ÑÐ°Ð¹ÐºÐ¾Ð¼) at [[raion]] level, ''obkoms'' (Ð¾Ð±ÐºÐ¾Ð¼) at [[oblast]] levels (known earlier as ''gubkoms'' (Ð³ÑÐ±ÐºÐ¾Ð¼) for [[guberniya]]s), ''gorkom'' (Ð³Ð¾ÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼) at city level, etc.

The bottom level of the Party was the &quot;primary party organization&quot; (Ð¿ÐµÑÐ²Ð¸ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð¿Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹Ð½Ð°Ñ Ð¾ÑÐ³Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ð·Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñ) or &quot;party cell&quot; (Ð¿Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹Ð½Ð°Ñ ÑÑÐµÐ¹ÐºÐ°). It was created within any organizational entity of any kind where there were at least three communists. The management of a cell was called &quot;party bureau&quot; (Ð¿Ð°ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹Ð½Ð¾Ðµ Ð±ÑÑÐ¾, Ð¿Ð°ÑÑÐ±ÑÑÐ¾). A partbureau was headed by the elected &quot;bureau secretary&quot; (ÑÐµÐºÑÐµÑÐ°ÑÑ Ð¿Ð°ÑÑÐ±ÑÑÐ¾).

At smaller party cells, secretaries were regular employees of the corresponding factory/hospital/school/etc. Sufficiently large party organizations were usually headed by an &quot;[[exempt secretary]]&quot; (Ð¾ÑÐ²Ð¾Ð±Ð¾Ð¶Ð´ÐµÐ½Ð½ÑÐ¹ ÑÐµÐºÑÐµÑÐ°ÑÑ), who drew his salary from the Party money.
During the 1970s the relative number of communists in Republics of the Soviet Union was as follows:
*Russian SFSR: 7.2%
*Ukraine: 5.35% (1976)
*Moldavia: 3.43% (1975)
*Tajikistan: less than 3%
*The mean value for the Soviet Union was: 5.935% (1974)

===Membership===
[[File:ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹Ð½ÑÐ¹ Ð±Ð¸Ð»ÐµÑ ÐÐÐ¡Ð¡.1989.jpg|thumb|left|CPSU [[membership card]] (1989)]]
Membership in the party ultimately became a privilege, with a small subset of the general population of Party becoming an elite class or [[nomenklatura]] in Soviet society. Nomenklatura enjoyed many perquisites denied to the average Soviet citizen. Among those perks were shopping at well-stocked stores, access to foreign merchandise, preference in obtaining housing, access to [[dacha]]s and holiday resorts, being allowed to travel abroad, sending their children to prestigious universities, and obtaining prestigious jobs (as well as party membership itself) for their children. It became virtually impossible to join the Soviet ruling and managing elite without being a member of the Communist Party.

Membership had its risks, however, especially in the 1930s when the party was subjected to purges under [[Joseph Stalin]]. Membership in the party was not open. To become a party member one had to be approved by various committees and one's past was closely scrutinised. As generations grew up never having known anything but the USSR, party membership became something one generally achieved after passing a series of stages. Children would join the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] and then, at the age of 14, might graduate to the [[Komsomol]] (Young Communist League) and ultimately, as an adult, if one had shown the proper adherence to [[party discipline]] or had the right connections one would become a member of the Communist Party itself. However, membership also had its obligations. [[Komsomol]] and CPSU members were expected not only to pay dues but also to carry out appropriate assignments and &quot;social tasks&quot; (Ð¾Ð±ÑÐµÑÑÐ²ÐµÐ½Ð½Ð°Ñ ÑÐ°Ð±Ð¾ÑÐ°).

In 1918 it had a membership of approximately 200,000. In the late 1920s under Stalin, the party engaged in a heavy recruitment campaign (the &quot;Lenin Levy&quot;) of new members from both the working class and rural areas. This was both an attempt to &quot;proletarianize&quot; the party and an attempt by Stalin to strengthen his base by outnumbering the [[Old Bolsheviks]] and reducing their influence in the party.

In 1925 there were 1,025,000 communist party members in a population of 147 million.&lt;ref&gt;Chetyrnadtsatyi s&quot;ezd Vseoyuznoi Kommunisticheskoi Partii (b), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, after an intensive recruitment campaign, membership rose to 1,200,000&lt;ref&gt;Organisational report of the Central Commmitte: Pyatnadtsatyi s&quot;ezd Vesoyuznoi Kommunisticheski Partii-(b), pp. 100-3. This number includes probationary members.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1933, the party had approximately 3.5 million members but as a result of the [[Great Purge]] party membership was cut down to 1.9 million by 1939. {{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} In 1986, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had over 19 million members or approximately 10% of the USSR's adult population. Over 44% of party members were classified as industrial workers, 12% were collective farmers. The CPSU had party organizations in fourteen of the USSR's 15 republics. In the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] itself there was no separate Communist Party until 1990 as affairs were controlled directly by the CPSU.

== History ==
{{Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}
{{Main|History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union}}

===End of Communist rule===

In [[1989]] Gorbachev allowed other political associations ([[de facto]] [[political parties]]) to coexist with the Communist Party and in 1990 obtained the repeal of Article Six of the USSR constitution which gave the party supremacy over all institutions in society, thus ending its [[vanguard party|vanguard]] status. The Communist Party's power over the state formally ended that same year with the newly-created [[Soviet Presidency]], whose first and only President was Party General Secretary Gorbachev.

The growing likelihood of the dissolution of the USSR itself led hardline elements in the CPSU to launch the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August Coup]] in 1991 which temporarily removed Gorbachev from power. On August 19, 1991, a day before the ''[[New Union Treaty]]'' was to be signed devolving power to the republics, a group calling itself the &quot;State Emergency Committee&quot; seized power in Moscow declaring that Gorbachev was ill and therefore relieved of his position as president. Soviet vice-president [[Gennadiy Yanayev]] was named acting president. The committee's eight members included [[KGB]] chairman [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], Internal Affairs Minister [[Boris Pugo]], Defense Minister [[Dmitriy Yazov]], and Prime Minister [[Valentin Pavlov]]. The coup dissolved because of large public demonstrations and the efforts of [[Boris Yeltsin]] who became the real power in Russia as a result. Gorbachev returned to Moscow as president but resigned as General Secretary and vowed to purge the party of hardliners. Yeltsin had the CPSU formally banned within the [[Russian SFSR]] on August 26. The [[KGB]] was disbanded as were other CPSU-related agencies and organisations. Yeltsin's action was later declared unconstitutional but by this time the USSR had ceased to exist.

The Communist Party in between Gorbachev's resignation and its suspension was politically impotent. By the time of the [[28th Congress of the CPSU]] in July 1990, the party was largely regarded as being unable to lead the country and had, in fifteen republics, split into opposing factions favouring either independent republics or the continuation of the Soviet Union. Stripped of its leading role in society the party lost its authority to lead the nation or the cohesion that kept the party united. Its last General Secretary was [[Vladimir Ivashko]], chosen on August 24, 1991. Actual political power lay in the positions of [[President of the Soviet Union]] (held by Gorbachev) and [[President of the Russian SFSR]] (held by Yeltsin). Ivashko remained for five days as acting General Secretary until August 29 when the party's activity was suspended by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].

Archives of the Party are now preserved in a number of Russian state archives ([[Archive of the President of the Russian Federation]], [[Russian State Archive of Contemporary History]], [[Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History]], [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]]), many of them remain classified.

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Russian adherents to the CPSU tradition, particularly as it existed before Gorbachev, reorganised themselves as the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. Today there are many parties in Russia claiming to be the successors of CPSU. Several of them used the name CPSU. However, CPRF is generally seen (because of its large size) as the inheritor of the CPSU in Russia.

In other republics, communists established the [[Armenian Communist Party]], [[Azerbaijan Communist Party (1993)|Communist Party of Azerbaijan]], [[Party of Communists of Kyrgyzstan]], [[Communist Party of Ukraine]], [[Party of Communists of Belarus]], [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova]], [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]] and the [[Communist Party of Tajikistan]]. Along with the CPRF, these parties formed the [[Union of Communist Parties|Union of Communist Parties - Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

* In [[Turkmenistan]], the local party apparatus led by [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] was renamed the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]] and abandoned communist ideology.
* In [[Uzbekistan]], [[Islam Karimov]] changed the CPSU branch into the [[People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan|People's Democratic Party]].
* In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the Socialist Labour Party was founded in 1992. This party would later evolve into the [[Communist Party of Georgia]] (SKP). Another communist faction in Georgia, which is larger than SKP, is the [[United Communist Party of Georgia]] (SEKP).
* In [[Estonia]], the CPSU branch was in the hands of reformers, who converted it into the [[Estonian Democratic Labour Party]] (EDTP). A minority regrouped into the [[Communist Party of Estonia (1990)|Communist Party of Estonia]].
* In [[Lithuania]], the CPSU was banned in 1991. A branch of &quot;progressive&quot; communists led by [[Algirdas Brazauskas]] established the [[Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania]] in 1992.
* In [[Latvia]], communist organizations were officially banned and a major part of the party there had broken away in 1990 and formed the [[Latvian Social Democratic Party]]. The remnants of CPSU became the [[Union of Communists of Latvia]], which went underground. Later, communists regrouped into the [[Socialist Party of Latvia]].
