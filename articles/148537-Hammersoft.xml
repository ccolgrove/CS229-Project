{{Military ranks}}
A '''general officer''' is an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] of high [[military rank]], usually in the army, and in some nations, the air force.&lt;ref&gt;In the [[United States]], general officers authorized to display a flag showing their rank are called &quot;[[flag officer]]s&quot;. Refer: {{cite journal|title=Flag officer - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster ...|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/netdict/flag+officer}}. In other nations the term &quot;flag officer&quot; usually applies to admirals.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is widely used by many nations of the world, and when a country uses a different term, there is an equivalent title given.

The term &quot;general&quot; is used in two ways: as the generic title for all grades of general officer; and as a specific rank. Since the late twentieth century, the rank of general is usually the highest active rank of a military not at war.

==All general officer ranks==
The various grades of general officer are at the top of the rank structure. Lower-ranking officers are known as [[field officer]]s or field-grade officers, and below them are company-grade officers.  All officers who commanded more than a single [[regiment]] came to be known as &quot;general officers&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The word &quot;general&quot; is used in its ordinary sense in English (and other languages) as relating to larger, general, military units, rather than smaller units in particular.

===Common systems===
There are two common systems of general ranks.

Variations of one form, the old European system, were once used throughout Europe. It is used in the [[United Kingdom]] (although it did not originate there), from which it eventually spread to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the [[United States|United States of America]]. The general officer ranks are named by prefixing &quot;general&quot;, as an adjective, with field officer ranks, although in some countries the highest general officers are titled [[field marshal]] or [[marshal]].

The other is derived from the [[French Revolution]], where generals' ranks are named according to the unit they (theoretically) command.

'''Old European system'''
{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''[[Field marshal]]''' or '''[[general Field Marshal|general field marshal]]'''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''''[[Colonel general]]'''''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''General''' or '''[[captain general]]'''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''[[Lieutenant general]]'''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''[[Sergeant major general]]''' or '''[[major general]]'''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''''[[Brigadier]] or [[brigadier general]]'''''
|}

The system used '''either''' a ''brigadier general'' rank, or a ''colonel general'' rank (i.e. exclude one of the italicised ranks.)

The rank of [[field marshal]] was used by some countries as the highest rank, while in other countries it was used as a divisional or brigade rank. Many countries (notably pre-revolutionary France and eventually much of Latin America) actually used two brigade command ranks, which is why some countries now use two stars as their [[brigade general]] insignia. (Mexico and Argentina still use two brigade command ranks.)

In some nations (particularly in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]), the equivalent to brigadier general is [[brigadier]], which is not always considered by these armies to be a general officer rank, although it is always treated as equivalent to the rank of brigadier general for comparative purposes. Unlike other general officers, the brigadier general rank is not derived from a ''field'' rank of brigadier.

The rank of major general is a shorter form of sergeant major general, and is lower than lieutenant general as a lieutenant outranks a sergeant major, although outranked by a major.

'''French (Revolutionary) system'''
{| style=&quot;border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''[[Marshal]]'''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''[[Army general]]'''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''[[Corps general]]'''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''[[Divisional general]]'''
|-
|align=&quot;center&quot;| '''[[Brigade general]]'''
|}

===Other variations===
Other nomenclatures for general officers include the titles and ranks:
* [[Adjutant general]]
* [[Commandant-General|Commandant-general]]
* [[Inspector general]]
* [[Captain general]]
* [[General-in-chief]]
* [[General of the Army]] (which is distinct from the title [[army general]])
* [[General of the Air Force (United States)|General of the Air Force]] (USA only)
* [[General of the Armies|General of the Armies of the United States]] (of America), a title created for General [[John J. Pershing]], and subsequently granted posthumously to [[George Washington]].
* [[General admiral]] (German Navy)
* Air general and aviation general ([[Chilean Air Force]]; roughly equivalent to [[air chief marshal]] and [[air vice-marshal]] respectively)
* Wing general and group general (Mexican Air Force; roughly equivalent to [[air commodore]] and acting [[air commodore]] respectively)
* Lieutenant-colonel general (a Serb rank immediately inferior to colonel general, and roughly equivalent to Commonwealth/US major general)
* Director general (a common administrative term sometimes used as an appointment in military services)
* Director general of national defence (most senior rank in the Mexican Armed Forces)
* [[Director of Intelligence Bureau (India)|Director of Intelligence Bureau]] (senior most [[four-star rank|four-star]] [[Indian Police Service]] post in India)
* ''Controller general'' (general officer rank in the [[French National Police]])
* ''Prefect general'' (the most senior rank of the [[Argentine Naval Prefecture]])
* [[Master-General of the Ordnance|Master-general of the ordnance]]

In addition to militarily educated generals, there are also generals in medicine and engineering. The rank of most senior chaplain, chaplain general, is also considered to be a general officer rank.

==The specific general rank==
In the Old European system, a general, without prefix or suffix (and sometimes referred to informally as a &quot;full general&quot;), is usually the most senior type of general, above [[lieutenant general]] and directly below field marshal. Usually it is the most senior peace-time rank, with more senior ranks (for example, field marshal) being used only in wartime, or as honorary titles.

In some armies, however, the rank of [[captain general]], [[general of the army]], army general or [[colonel general]] occupied or occupies this position.  Depending on circumstances and the army in question, these ranks may be considered to be equivalent to a full general or to a field marshal.

The rank of general came about as a &quot;captain-general&quot;, the captain of an army in general (i.e., the whole army). The rank of captain-general began appearing around the time of the organization of professional armies in the 17th century. In most countries &quot;[[captain-general]]&quot; contracted to just &quot;general&quot;.

==Air force and navy equivalents==
Some countries (such as the United States) use the general officer ranks for both the [[army]] and the [[air force]]; others only use the general officer ranks for the army, while in the air force they use [[air officer]]s as the equivalent of general officers.  They use the air force rank of [[air chief marshal]] as the equivalent of the specific army rank of general.  This latter group includes the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force]] and those based on it (e.g., [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nigeria]], etc.).

In most [[navy|navies]], [[flag officer]]s are the equivalent of general officers, and the naval rank of [[admiral]] is equivalent to the specific army rank of general.  A noteworthy historical exception was the [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] naval rank &quot;general at sea&quot;.  In recent years in the American service there is a tendency to use ''flag officer'' and ''flag rank'' to refer to generals and admirals of the services collectively.
