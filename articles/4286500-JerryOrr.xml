It lasted from March 1 to March 4, when most of the workers voluntarily returned to work.  During the strike, Korail's passenger service was decreased by 60%, on both national and [[Seoul Subway]] lines.  Freight service was also greatly reduced.

The principal issue, which was not resolved during the strike, was Korail's replacement of regular long-term positions with short-term contract positions.  The strike was declared illegal by the government after [[emergency arbitration]] was imposed, and at least 411 strikers were imprisoned.

The female [[KTX]] attendants' union, whose members are not employed by Korail but by a subcontractor, continued their walkout.
