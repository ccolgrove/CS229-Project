'''LuÃ­s Carlos Almeida da Cunha''' (born 17 November 1986),  commonly known as '''Nani''', is a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] footballer currently playing as a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] for English club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[Premier League]] and the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]]. Although predominantly right-footed, he has been utilised on the left-wing on many occasions.

Nani was born in [[Cape Verde]] and emigrated to Europe with his family at an early age. He was raised in Portugal and began his football career playing for local side [[Real Sport Clube|Real MassamÃ¡]]. At the age of 16, he began training with [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] and [[S.L. Benfica]] on alternate days, eventually joining Sporting's youth squad after they offered him pre-season training. In 2005, he made his professional debut with the club and won the [[TaÃ§a de Portugal|Portuguese Cup]] during his second season with them. Nani was named the [[SJPF Young Player of the Month]] for May 2007 and his performances with Sporting culminated into a move to English club side [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in July 2007 for a fee of Â£13.5 million. Nani won the [[2007 FA Community Shield|Community Shield]] on his competitive debut at the club and has since added a number of trophies which included the [[2007â08 Premier League|Premier League]] and [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]] during his debut season at the club. He has established himself as first-choice winger at Manchester United and has won a further Premier League title, the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|Football League Cup]], one [[FIFA Club World Cup]], and three [[Community Shield]] titles. Individually, Nani has been included into the [[Professional Footballers' Association]] (PFA) [[PFA Team of the Year|Premier League Team of the Year]] on one occasion and was a nominee for the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in 2011.

Nani is also a [[Portugal national football team|Portugal international]]. Prior to playing at senior level, he played at [[Portugal national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. He made his senior international debut in September 2006 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and scored his first international goal during the 4â2 defeat in [[Copenhagen]]. Since his debut, he has made 51 appearances and scored 12 goals for Portugal.

In United's following league game at the [[Britannia Stadium]], Nani scored his third goal of the season in a 1-1 draw with [[Stoke City]]. He played a neat one-two with [[Darren Fletcher]] before slaloming his way through the defense and firing a low shot inside the left post. Nani started the match against Manchester city where they fell victim to a 1-6 beating at home to their neighbours. On 1 November, Nani was shortlisted for the prestigious [[FIFA Ballon d'Or]] one of just four Premier League players [[Luis Suarez]], [[Sergio Aguero]] and fellow Manchester United player [[ Wayne Rooney]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Style of play==

|quote=&quot;Nani's got the potential to do what he wants. He's one of the sharpest players around, has a great strike with both feet - he's got the potential to be a top, top player.&quot;
|source=â Manchester United team-mate [[Rio Ferdinand]] on Nani&lt;ref name=&quot;NaniESPN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/stats?id=67716&amp;cc=5739 |title=Nani |accessdate=6 November 2010 |publisher=soccernet.espn |work=ESPN Soccernet}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the early stages of his career at Manchester United, Nani often invited comparison in playing style and ability with club and international colleague Cristiano Ronaldo, for whom he often deputised at club level.

In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's style has developed into a more classical winger's style, able to play on both wings though more comfortable on the right, utilising pace, ball control and trickery to create space. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague.He can Also play in the more attacking position of forward or wing forward.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.premierleague.com/page/Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration==
Nani celebrates with a ''mortal'' ({{lang-en|Leap of death}}), similar to that of [[Obafemi Martins]] and [[Lomana LuaLua]]. The celebration derives from Nani's background in [[capoeira]], which he used to practice as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Lawrence |title=Dancing Nani leads Portugal's new generation |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/jun/10/newsstory.sport2 |work=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=10 June 2007 |accessdate=9 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a while, it was reported that United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, had banned Nani's celebration due to fear for his safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=McDonnell |title=Fergie bans Nani's celebration |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/2007/07/27/fergie-bans-nani-celebration-89520-19528747/ |work=Mirror.co.uk |publisher=Trinity Mirror |date=27 July 2007 |accessdate=12 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nani denounced the reports in August 2007, stating that it was &quot;not true&quot; and that &quot;Ferguson has never spoken to me about this subject and I am going to continue to celebrate goals in this way. The conversations he has had with me are normal conversations, like he has with all players.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=Nani feels settled at United |url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Football-News/2007/Aug/Nani-feels-settled-at-United.aspx |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=23 August 2007 |accessdate=25 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
