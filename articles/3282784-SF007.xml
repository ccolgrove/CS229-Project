'''Ornatos Violeta''' were a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[alternative rock]] group whose music included some other influences, such as [[funk]], [[jazz]] and [[ska]]. The band was formed in the city of [[Porto]]. 

With [[Manel Cruz]] (voices), [[Nuno Prata]]  (bass), [[Peixe]]  (guitar), [[KinÃ¶rn]] (drums) and [[ElÃ­sio Donas]] (keyboard) and only two albums, they quickly became a reference in [[Portuguese music]] of the end of the 1990s, though  the most successful part of their career lasted for only three years, after which the group split.

==History==
In 1997, they composed '''''CÃ£o!''''' (Dog!) their first album - which included the song ''Letra S'', a duet with [[Manuela Azevedo]], the voice of [[ClÃ£]] (another successful Portuguese band) - an album where for the first time the group showed they were keen to explore a mixed sound, with Cruz's unique writing style, much to their fans', and most of the national musical reviewers', delight.
In the following year, during the [[Expo 98]], they collaborated on the compilation ''Tejo Beat'' alongside [[Boss AC]], [[Blasted Mechanism]], [[Zen (band)|Zen]] and [[Flood (band)|Flood]] with the song ''Tempo de Nascer''.

Their last album, '''''O Monstro Precisa de Amigos''''' (The Monster Needs Friends), came out in 1999, with a more carefully thought production, and generally speaking, a less active and calmer style. The album contained the singles ''Ouvi Dizer'', a duet with the older Portuguese musician [[Vitor Espadinha]], and ''CapitÃ£o Romance'', with [[Gordon Gano]], vocalist of the well-known [[Violent Femmes]]. It was also during that year that they helped to produce XX Anos XX Bandas, a tribute to the Portuguese band ''Xutos e PontapÃ©s'', with a cover of Xutos' song ''Circo de Feras''.

After some speculation about their future, Ornatos Violeta split in 2002. Fortunately for their fans,  [[Pluto (Portuguese band)|Pluto]] followed, a more traditional rock group, with Manel Cruz (vocals + rhythm guitar) and Peixe (lead guitar).

In 2009 one of the main radio stations in Portugal, Antena 3, celebrated 15 years choosing the best 15 albums of those years. '''''O Monstro Precisa de Amigos''''' came in 1st place.
