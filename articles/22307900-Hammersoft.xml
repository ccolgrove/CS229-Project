'''DM Glen Douglas''' is a [[NATO]] defence munitions depot in [[Argyll and Bute]], [[Scotland]], built between  1962 and 1966.  As of 1989, it served NATO as a pre-positioned wartime ammunitions depot, storing around 40,000 tons of missiles, depth-charges, and conventional shells. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The depot itself is near the glen's head, less than a mile from [[Loch Long]].  [[Arrochar, Argyll and Bute|Arrochar]] is the nearest village.

The depot covers almost {{convert|650|acre|km2}} and contains 56 magazines built into a hillside.&lt;ref name=dlo/&gt;  It is connected to the rail network via a short spur from the [[West Highland Line]].   In the 1970s, a jetty was built at Glen Mallan on Loch Long, linked to the depot via an [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] road through Glen Culanach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
