'''Adam Andretti''' (born March 24, 1979) is an American [[race car]] [[driving|driver]]. He is the younger brother of veteran [[NASCAR]] racer [[John Andretti]], nephew of [[Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Mario Andretti]] and first cousin to [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] champion [[Michael Andretti]] and [[Jeff Andretti]].  He is the first [[cousin]] once-removed to [[IndyCar Series|IndyCar]] driver [[Marco Andretti]].  His father, [[Aldo Andretti]], retired from driving a race car after he nearly died in an accident. Andretti is a graduate of the [[Skip Barber Racing School]].

Andretti's racing career started in 1994 at the age of 15 with the help of his brother John, who helped Adam obtain a ride in the new half-scale Mini Cup Stock Car series, driving for Terry Lingner of Lingner Group Productions at the Velodrome in [[Indianapolis]]. He showed promise by winning four races in 1995 and finishing fourth in the series championship. After his stint in the Mini Stocks, Andretti raced [[Kart racing|karts]]. His brother Mark bought him a 125cc shifter kart and they raced for the next two years in the SKUSA series. In 1998, he finished second at the Formula C World Karting Championship held in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. He also ran in the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], an event sponsored by the [[Grand American Road Racing Association]].

In 2000, Andretti drove the #12 car in the short-lived United States [[Formula 3]] Championship for Duesenberg Brothers Racing. He won a race and finished third in the series points championship. Then in 2001 and 2002, he drove in [[NASCAR]]'s [[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Southwest Series|Featherlite Southwest Series]]. In 2003, Andretti drove a [[Corvette]] at [[Sebring Raceway]] in the [[SPEED World Challenge]] Series. He drove in the 2004 Rolex [[24 Hours of Daytona]]. 

Since then, he has served as a racing instructor for ''[[Road &amp; Track]]'' magazine and some driving schools, including the [[Richard Petty]] Driving Experience.

Andretti made his [[Indy Pro Series]] debut at [[Chicagoland Speedway]] on September 9, 2007. His race ended with an altercation with IndyCar veteran [[Jimmy Kite]].  Andretti announced after the race that he would compete in a full Indy Pro Series season in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indycar.com/pro/news/story.php?story_id=9915 Full ride for Andretti], indycar.com, September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 17 he announced that he had signed a deal with the new FuZion Autosport team for the upcoming season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indycar.com/news/story.php?story_id=10317 Andretti signs with new team], indycar.com, December 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the team nor Andretti failed to participate in any league-sponsored test sessions or enter any races.
