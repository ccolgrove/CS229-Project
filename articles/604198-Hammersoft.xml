'''The Catholic University of America''' ('''CUA''') is a [[private university]] located in [[Washington, D.C.]] in the [[United States]]. It is a [[pontifical university]] of the [[Catholic Church]] in the United States and the only institution of [[higher education]] founded by the U.S. Catholic bishops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cua.edu/about-cua/history-of-CUA.cfm CUA History]&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1887 as a graduate and research center following approval by [[Pope Leo XIII]] on Easter Sunday,&lt;ref name=&quot;cua030410&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://publicaffairs.cua.edu/news/03DOCPryzDedicationRemarks.htm| title=Remarks at the Dedication of the Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center| author=The Very Rev. David M. O'Connell, C.M.| accessdate=2008-10-09| date=2003-04-10}} Easter fell on April 10 in 1887.&lt;/ref&gt; the university began offering undergraduate education in 1904.

The university's campus lies within the [[Brookland (Washington, D.C.)|Brookland]] neighborhood, known as &quot;Little Rome&quot;, which contains 60 Catholic institutions, including [[Trinity Washington University]] and the [[Dominican House of Studies]].

CUA's programs emphasize the [[liberal arts]], professional education, and personal development. The school stays closely connected with the Catholic Church and Catholic organizations. The [[American Cardinals Dinner]] is put on by the residential U.S. Cardinals each year to raise scholarship funds for CUA. The university has a long history of working with the [[Knights of Columbus]]; the university's law school and basilica have dedications to the involvement and support of the Knights.

The university has been visited twice by reigning Popes. [[Pope John Paul II]] visited on October 7, 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Videos of his two addresses on campus can be seen [http://papalvisit.cua.edu/1979visit/1979remarks.cfm here].&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 2008, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] came to the campus's Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center and gave an address on Catholic education and academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papalvisit.cua.edu/ Papal visit information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pope&quot;&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/april/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080417_cath-univ-washington_en.html &quot;Pope: Catholic colleges should be in line with church&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1882 Bishop [[John Lancaster Spalding]] went to Rome to obtain [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s support for the University and persuaded family friend Mary Gwendoline Caldwell to pledge $300,000 to establish it.  On March 7, 1889, the Pope issued the encyclical ''Magni Nobis'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_07031889_magni-nobis_en.html Magni Nobis]&lt;/ref&gt;  granting the university its charter and establishing its mission as the instruction of [[Catholicism]] and [[human nature]] together at the graduate level. By developing new leaders and new knowledge, it was believed that the University would strengthen and enrich Catholicism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;The founding, and Spalding's role, are covered in [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=980DE1DE1E3EEF33A25756C1A9609C94649FD7CF A Catholic University; The Zeal of a Few Prelates Rewarded, N.Y. Times, June 15, 1885, at 5]. Spalding was quoted: &quot;Let there be, then, an American Catholic University, where our young men, in the atmosphere of faith and purity, of high thinking and plain living, shall become more intimately conscious of the truth of their religion and of the genius of their country, where they shall learn the repose and dignity which belong to their ancient Catholic descent, and yet not lose the fire which glows in the blood of a new people....&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders wished to emphasize the Churchâs special role in United States. They had a conviction that [[scientific]] and [[humanistic]] research, informed by faith, would strengthen the Church. They hoped to develop a national [[institution]] that would promote the faith in a context of [[religious freedom]], spiritual pluralism, and intellectual rigor.

When the University first opened for classes in the fall of 1888, the curriculum consisted of lectures in mental and [[moral philosophy]], [[English literature]], the [[Sacred Scripture]]s, and the various branches of [[theology]]. At the end of the second term, lectures on [[canon law]] were added and the first students were graduated in 1889. In 1904, an [[undergraduate]] program was added and it quickly established a reputation for excellence.&lt;ref&gt;The president of the first undergraduate class was Frank Kuntz, whose memoir of that period was published by the University press. Frank Kuntz, Undergraduate Days: 1904-1908 (CUA 1958). The University gives an annual award named for Kuntz.[http://universitycenter.cua.edu/leader/slrc.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of CUA attracted other Catholic institutions to the area, including colleges, religious orders, and national service organizations. Between 1900 and 1940, more than 50 international Catholic institutions rented or owned property in neighboring [[Brookland, Washington, D.C.|Brookland]].  During the post World War II years, Catholic University experienced an expansion in enrollment thanks to the [[G.I. Bill]].

Today the campus has over 6,000 students from all 50 states and around the world.

==Campus==
{{See also|List of buildings at The Catholic University of America}}
The CUA campus is in the residential community of [[Brookland, Washington, DC|Brookland]] in [[Northeast, Washington, D.C.|Northeast Washington]]; its main entrance is 620 Michigan Ave., NE. The campus is bound by Michigan Avenue to the south, North Capitol Street to the west, Hawaii Avenue to the north, and John McCormick Road to the east.  It is three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) north of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]].

[[Image:CUA Mall.jpg|left|thumb|The Mall, with the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception|National Shrine]] in the background]]
The tree-lined campus is {{convert|193|acre|km2}}. [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and modern design dominate among the universityâs 55 major buildings. Between McMahon and Gibbons halls and alongside the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] runs The Mall, a large strip of grass that is often the site of kickball games and sunbathers.  [[Silvio O. Conte|Conte]] Circle is in the middle of Centennial Village, a cluster of eight residential houses.

The Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center was opened in the spring of 2003, bringing student dining services, the campus bookstore, student organization offices, an 800-person ballroom, a convenience store, and more student services under one roof. The John K. Mullen Library completed a $6,000,000 renovation in 2004, significantly improving the lighting and aesthetics of the interior and allowing the classical architecture to better shine through.

The [[Columbus School of Law]] is on the main campus and is self-contained in its own building with moot courtrooms, a library, chapel, classrooms, and offices. On the Pryzbyla Center side of the building is the Law School Lawn, where the [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate Frisbee]] team can often be found. Theological College, the United States's national seminary, is located across Michigan Avenue from the main campus and sits between the Dominican House of Studies, a seminary for the [[Order of Preachers]], and offices for the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]]. Trinity Washington University is also near the university and is a quarter mile south along Michigan Avenue.
[[File:McGivney Hall, CUA - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|McGivney Hall]]
In April 2004, the University purchased {{convert|49|acre|m2}} of land from the [[Armed Forces Retirement Home]]. The parcel is the largest plot of open space in the District and makes CUA the largest university in D.C. by land area. There are currently no plans for the parcel other than to secure the property for future growth.

In 2007, the University unveiled plans to expand the campus by adding three new dorms to the north side of campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuatower.com/2007/02/09/campus-gothic-dorm-set-for-spot-near-flather/ 'Campus Gothic' Dorm Set for Spot Near Flather - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuatower.com/2007/03/16/construction-begins-for-opus-hall/ Construction Begins for Opus Hall - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these dorms, the seven-story tall Opus Hall, houses 420 upper-class students, making it the largest dorm on campus. The three new dorms, when built, will replace the two now demolished dorms on the south side of campus, Conaty and Spellman.  Although dorms are coeducational with men and women living in the same buildings, this is being phased out beginning in the fall of 2011 with a return to single-sex dorms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/06/14/qt#262443 |title=Catholic U. Will Return to Single-Sex Dorms |publisher=Inside Higher Ed |date=June 14, 2011 |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campus is served by the [[Brookland-CUA (Washington Metro)|Brookland-CUA]] station on the [[Red Line (Washington Metro)|Red Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]].  [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]], [[Capitol Hill]], and the [[Smithsonian]] museums are only a few minutes' ride away. Near campus are the offices of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] and the [[Mount St. Sepulchre Franciscan Monastery|Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land]].

===Green initiatives and sustainability===
CUA has environmental sustainability programs including participation in Earth Day, [[Casey Trees]] tree planting, and Campus Beautification Day. CUA constructed its most recent building, Opus Hall, as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-compliant, and purchases 30% of its electricity from green sources.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite news |url=http://inside.cua.edu/081031/story1.cfm|title=CUA Makes Strides in Environmental Sustainability|first=Maggie |last=Master|work=Inside CUA|date=May 1, 2009|accessdate=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The university is participating in the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card rating.&lt;ref name=&quot;The College Sustainability Report Card&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The College Sustainability Report Card|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org//|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CUA Sustainability Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Trees|url=http://planttrees.cua.edu//|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=green/&gt;

In 2009, the School of Architecture and Planning introduced a Master of Science in Sustainable Design degree.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;

==Academics==
{{As of|2009|7}}, Catholic University has 11 schools and the Metropolitan College&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cua.edu/academics/schools-colleges.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;:
*School of Architecture and Planning

in addition to 21 research centers and facilities.

The 11 schools offer [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degrees (or appropriate professional degrees) in 66 programs and [[Master's Degree]]s in 103 programs.&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt;  [[Undergraduate]] degrees are awarded in 72 programs by six schools: [[architecture]] and planning, [[arts]] and [[sciences]], [[engineering]], [[music]], [[nursing]] and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt;

Undergraduates combine a liberal arts [[curriculum]] in arts and sciences with courses in a major field of study. The Metropolitan School provides programs for adults who wish to earn [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degrees or participate in continuing education and certificate programs on a part-time basis. 88% of undergraduates and 61% of graduate students are Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;http://publicaffairs.cua.edu/factbook/facts.html Retrieved 2009-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic University is the only U.S. university with an [[ecclesiastical]] faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] and is one of the few U.S. universities with ecclesiastical faculties of [[philosophy]] and [[theology|sacred theology]]. Theological College, the university [[seminary]], prepares men for the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]].  The School of Theology and Religious Studies is a member of the [[Washington Theological Consortium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washtheocon.org/members.html|title=Member Institutions|publisher=[[Washington Theological Consortium]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninety-eight percent of full time faculty have doctoral or terminal degrees and 68% teach undergraduates.&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt; Of the full time faculty, 59% are Catholic.

CUA was one of the fourteen founding members of the [[Association of American Universities]], although it withdrew its membership in 2002, citing a conflict with its mission.&lt;ref name=ChronGT&gt;Paul Fain, [http://chronicle.com/article/As-AAU-Admits-Georgia-Tech-to/65200/ As AAU Admits Georgia Tech to Its Exclusive Club, Other Universities Await the Call], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', April 21, 2010, Accessed May 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research centers and facilities===

Over time, several national Catholic scholarly associations became based at the university, including the Catholic Biblical Association of America, publisher of the [[Catholic Biblical Quarterly]], and (for many years) the American Catholic Philosophical Association. The university is also home to the [[Catholic University of America Press]].

===Academic freedom===
Although the University continues to be under censure by the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) for academic freedom violations and continues to ban certain speakers from campus, CUA has made a general statement of policy that the academic freedom of its faculty and students will be respected.&lt;ref name=freedomPolicy&gt;[http://policies.cua.edu/faculty/faculty%20I/governing%20docs/freedom.cfm Statement on Academic Freedom]&lt;/ref&gt; It considers academic freedom a &quot;fundamental condition for research and dissemination of information.&quot;&lt;ref name=freedomPolicy /&gt; The policy sets forth its respect for the right and responsibility of its faculty and students to (i) conduct research, (ii) publish their findings, and (iii) discuss ideas according to the principles, sources and methods of their academic disciplines.&lt;ref name=&quot;freedomPolicy&quot; /&gt; The University further &quot;sanctions&quot; the investigation of &quot;unexplored phenomena, advancement of knowledge, and critical examination of ideas, old and new&quot; and &quot;accepts the responsibility of protecting both teacher and student from being forced to deny truth that has been discovered or to assert claims that have not been established in the discipline.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;freedomPolicy&quot; /&gt;

However, the University specifically provides that &quot;theologians&quot; in the University are &quot;expected to give assent to the teachings of the magisterium in keeping with the various degrees of assent that are called for by authoritative teaching.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;freedomPolicy&quot; /&gt; It should be noted that the Catholic University of America does not offer general studies in theology. Instead it offers doctorates in historical theology and systematic theology, the latter of which âundertakes the task of a comprehensive and synthetic understanding of the Christian faith as mediated through the Scriptures and the Catholic Tradition and as interpreted by the conciliar and papal magisterium &lt;ref&gt;[http://religiousstudies.cua.edu/graduate/STRS_Systematic_Theology.cfm CUA School of Theology and Religious Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it offers ecclesiastical degrees (i.e., licensees to teach Catholic Theology) in Liturgical Studies and Sacramental Theology, Moral Theology/Ethics, and Historical and Systematic Theology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religiousstudies.cua.edu/academic.cfm CUA School of Theology and Religious Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to teach theology at The Catholic University of America, one must be licensed to teach Catholic Theology by the Vatican.

====American Association of University Professors censure (the Curran case)====
In 1967, tenured professor Reverend [[Charles Curran (theologian)|Charles E. Curran]] was fired for his views on birth control, but was reinstated after a five-day faculty-led strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;An Urge to Retire&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,941559,00.html An Urge to Retire] Time Magazine July 21, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1986, the Vatican declared that Curran could no longer teach theology at Catholic University of America schools, because &quot;clashes with church authorities finally culminated in a decision by the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, headed by then-Cardinal (and now Pope) [[Pope Benedict XVI|Josef Ratzinger]], that Curran was neither suitable nor eligible to be a professor of Catholic theology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.georgetown.edu/detail.html?id=1589010876 Loyal Dissent Memoir of a Catholic Theologian]&lt;/ref&gt;  The areas of dispute included publishing articles that debated theological and ethical views regarding divorce, &quot;artificial contraception&quot;, &quot;masturbation, pre-marital intercourse and homosexual acts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/9CA4679F-7BC7-4AD7-BA37-0C1B00AEBAA1/0/CatholicUUSA.pdf quoting Cardinal Ratzinger. Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in the [[American Association of University Professors]] report, &quot;Had it not been for the intervention of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Professor Curran would undoubtedly still be active in the university's Department of Theology, a popular teacher, honored theologian, and respected colleague.&quot;&lt;ref name=aaup&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/9CA4679F-7BC7-4AD7-BA37-0C1B00AEBAA1/0/CatholicUUSA.pdf|work=Academe|date=Sept-Oct 1989|title=Academic Freedom and Tenure|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curran's attorneys argued that CUA did not follow proper procedures or its own policy statements in handling the case.  In essence, CUA claimed that the Vatican's actions against Curran trumped any campus-based policy or tenure rules.

In 1989, he filed suit against Catholic University, and the court determined that the University had the right to fire him for teaching views in contradiction to the school's religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1177244.html Curran Loses Suit Against Catholic U.; Theology Professor's Dismissal Upheld]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the [[American Association of University Professors]] (AAUP) defended Curran and censured the Catholic University of America due to its failure to adhere to the AAUP's Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure, and that it found that &quot;unsatisfactory conditions of academic freedom and tenure have been found to prevail&quot; at the Catholic University of America. {{As of|2009|7}}, the Catholic University remains on the list of censured institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/about/censuredadmins/default.htm Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The two conditions for having the censure removed are inviting Curran, whose license to teach Catholic Theology had been suspended by the Vatican, back to campus and changing the University's &quot;Statement on Academic Freedom.&quot;&lt;ref name=prez&gt;[http://inside.cua.edu//president.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt; President [[David M. O'Connell]] refused to do either stating, &quot;Every American university has a right to govern itself according to its own identity, mission, standards and procedures.&quot;&lt;ref name=prez /&gt;

However, the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] continues to accredit CUA and renewed the accreditation in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msche.org/institutions_view.asp?idinstitution=86 Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.campuscorner.com/district-of-columbia-colleges/catholic-university-of-america.htm Retrieved 2009-07-30.&lt;/ref&gt; In a controversy not involving CUA in the 1980s, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]]  noted &quot;the right of an institution to pursue its established educational purpose,&quot; supports the &quot;governing board&quot; decisions on upholding &quot;the interests of the founders, the supporting religious group, the supporting governmental agency, or other supporting party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ACADEMIC/CATHACAD.HTM|first= Michael J. |last=Mazza|title=HEART ATTACK: CATHOLIC ACADEME MEETS &quot;EX CORDE ECCLESIAE&quot;|work=&quot;Fidelity&quot; Magazine|date=February 1995|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speaker policy====
[[Image:PopeBenedictatCUA.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Pope Benedict XVI about to address the crowd in the Pryzbyla Center]]
The University as a policy does not allow outside guests to speak on campus to any audience if they have previously expressed an opinion on abortion rights or other serious issues conflicting with the Catholic Church's official position. Applying this policy in 2004, CUA was criticized for rescinding [[Stanley Tucci]]'s invitation for a seminar about Italian cinema, because he had lent past support for [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/694407201.html?dids=694407201:694407201&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;fmac=&amp;date=Sep+17%2C+2004&amp;author=Amy+Argetsinger&amp;desc=Catholic+U.+Bars+Actor-Activist+at+Forum Washington Post, September 17, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the campus that next month, university President [[David O'Connell]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;I consider any pro-choice advocacy â whether deliberate or accidental, whether presented under the guise of academic freedom or right to free speech â as incompatible with that fidelity and not worthy of The Catholic University of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inside.cua.edu/041008/president.cfm InsideCUA Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The next year, in 2005, the school was criticized for initially rejecting an application for recognition of a student chapter of the NAACP; one of the reasons officials cited in its rejection was the national organization's pro-choice stance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.cuatower.com/media/storage/paper225/news/2005/04/22/News/Year-In.Review.Times.Marked.By.Controversy.And.Frustration-936838.shtml ''The Tower'', April 22, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the CUA administration barred a student-run on-campus performance of [[Eve Ensler]]'s ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]''.

The speaker policy gained national attention again in 2008 when the CUA College Republicans, the University's largest student organization, hosted former [[Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Tom Ridge]].{{refneeded|date=November 2011}} Ridge once campaigned on a moderate pro-choice platform despite being a Catholic. In spite of this, school officials still approved Ridge to speak. Members of the [[Cardinal Newman Society]] heavily criticized the organization.{{refneeded|date=November 2011}}

In 2009, the school made its speaker policy more stringent, prohibiting all candidates for political office from speaking on campus. Representatives of both Democratic and Republican clubs on campus have criticized the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/18/politics/uwire/main4028660.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Catholic U.

==Student life==
{{unsourcedsect|date=June 2011}}
[[Image:GibbonsHall 07120029.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Gibbons Hall (built in 1911), a residence hall]]
There are over 100 registered student clubs and organizations at CUA for a wide variety of interests including athletics, academics, social, Greek life, service, political and religious.

Although the Catholic University states that it does not have any Greek life on campus, it in fact has two social Greek organizations and one service Greek organization. [[Catholic University Greek Life]] includes [[Alpha Delta Gamma]] the National Catholic Social FraternityâKappa chapter, [[Kappa Tau Gamma]] the local Christian Social-Service Sorority, and [[Alpha Phi Omega]] the National Service FraternityâZeta Mu chapter which is co-ed.

The CUA Student Association is the university's undergraduate student government. It includes the General Assembly, an advocacy body, and the Student Fee Allocation Board which serves as the steward of the Student Activity and Club Sports Fee.

The graduate student government is a separate entity and was not affected by the changes during the 2006-2007 academic year. Annual events include week-long Homecoming celebrations, the Mr. CUA competition, and a number of dances including the Beaux Arts Ball, the Mistletoe Ball, and the Athletes Ball. In addition to the radio station [[WCUA (FM)|WCUA]], other campus media outlets include ''The Quorum'', the campus political magazine, CUA-TV, the campus television station, ''The Tower'', the campus' independent weekly newspaper, and ''CRUX'', a literary magazine.

The music and drama programs{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}&lt;!---credit classes or volunteers?--&gt; stage productions each semester, performances ranging from Broadway productions to plays.  Catholic University students also participate in is a Symphony orchestra and choral groups, including [[A capella|A Cappella]] groups Take Note and RedLine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redlineacappella.com/redlineacappella/home.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
