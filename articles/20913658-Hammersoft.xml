'''Noah Tate''' (previously '''Christopher Francis Tate, Jr.''') is the son of [[Charity Tate|Charity]] and [[Chris Tate]]. He appeared from 2004 to 2005 and returned in 2009 along with his mother, Charity.

Noah is born in prison while Charity was serving a life sentence for the murder of his father, Chris, who had actually committed suicide. His paternity was doubtful as Charity had slept with her cousins, [[Cain Dingle|Cain]] and [[Marlon Dingle|Marlon]] as well as her husband, but DNA tests confirmed he was Chris's son. Charity, knowing she couldn't keep Noah with her in prison, sells him to his aunt [[Zoe Tate|Zoe]], who calls him Christopher after her brother. In return for this, Zoe tells the court that Chris framed Charity for murder and she is freed. The courts, however, do not allow Zoe to adopt Christopher, due to her current workload, other family commitments and mental illness so Charity takes him back, returning his name to Noah and leaves the village in 2005. 

In October 2009, Noah and Charity return to the village when Charity discovers that her fiance, Michael, has been having an affair with Charity's daughter, Debbie. After the wedding is called off, Noah and Charity move in with Debbie and her daughter, Sarah. Charity sends Noah to the local primary school as he is too old to go to playgroup with Sarah.

PC Swirling often appears in the village whenever the police are called. On 28 December 2006, Swirling appears when a fight breaks out in the street between [[Carl King]] and [[Jamie Hope]]. Jamie presses charges and Swirling arrests Carl for assault. In April 2007, he is called to the Post Office by [[Viv Hope]] when [[Belle Dingle]] steals a packet of sweets and then insults her. Whilst waiting for the police, Viv locks Belle and her mother [[Lisa Dingle|Lisa]] in the shop. When PC Swirling and a colleague arrive, they are both unsympathetic to Viv and Lisa's claims and tell them that both were acting like children. Swirling threatens to charge them with wasting police time, before leaving. Later that month he visits the village again when [[Jo Sugden|Jo Stiles]] calls the police after believing [[Billy Hopwood]] had assaulted [[Andy Sugden]]. Swirling arrests Billy and after taking a statement from Andy, he charges Billy with assault. Andy later changes his statement and Swirling releases Billy. On 3 July 2007, Swirling appears when [[Eli Dingle]] stages a fake robbery at Tug Ghyll. In August 2008, Mike appears when [[Donna Windsor-Dingle]] and [[Ross Kirk]] are nearly killed in a car chase. In July 2009, he appears when [[Rodney Blackstock]]'s car crashes into the Farm shop. He is later called to Mulberry Cottage when [[Laurel Thomas]] accuses [[Sally Spode]] of trying to kill her and kidnapping her son [[Arthur Thomas (Emmerdale)|Arthur]].

Swirling returns on 26 February 2010 when he, Faye and Natasha are called out to the hospital to try and identify a body but it is not Mark's. Swirling appears again on 22 June 2010 at Home Farm after Mark's credit card is used to purchase some flowers which Natasha and her son [[Nathan Wylde|Nathan]] both knew were not from Mark although they did not let on about it. Swirling later appears at Butler's Farm after [[John Barton (Emmerdale)|John Barton]] reports his daughter, [[Holly Barton|Holly]]'s disappearance. Swirling appears in September again at Butler's Farm after it is burgled. Swirling and his colleague give John and his wife [[Moira Barton|Moira]] advice on not leaving windows or doors open. John tells Swirling that he suspects that Holly committed the burglary to fund her drug addiction. Moira later tracks Holly down and takes her to the police station where Swirling arrests her and she confesses to carrying out the burglary. When he asks Moira if she wants Holly to be charged she agrees but Swirling suggests she and John get Holly some counselling. Swirling appears again on 2 December 2010. He is at the police station when Moira is arrested for possession of heroin which she had been going to give to Holly. Swirling recognizes Moira and he interviews her along with the arresting officer. Swirling tells Moira she could go to prison for the offence. He offers to help Moira get a more lenient sentence if she agrees to tell him everything she knows about where the heroin came from and she does so. On 23 February 2011, Swirling visits the offices of Emmerdale haulage to inform Carl that his brother [[Jimmy King (Emmerdale)|Jimmy]]'s van has been discovered in Peterborough with bloodstains inside. On 1 March, he returns to inform Jimmy's wife [[Nicola King|Nicola]] that the blood found in the van has been positively identified as Jimmy's. The following day, Swirling returns to tell Nicola and Carl that a man fitting Jimmy's description has been located in a hospital in Nottingham. On 21 April 2011, Swirling is called to Holdgate Farm after it is burgled by [[Cain Dingle]]. Swirling takes details of the burglary from Cain's ex-girlfriend [[Charity Tate]], her current boyfriend [[Jai Sharma]], whose car Cain had stolen, and Jai's brother [[Nikhil Sharma|Nikhil]], all of whom implicate Cain as the culprit. Swirling later visits Cain at Tug Ghyll and questions him about his whereabouts. Despite [[Cameron Murray]] giving him an alibi, Swirling arrests Cain and takes him to the police station. He later visits Cain's colleague [[Ryan Lamb]], who Cain had tricked into acting as a lookout, at his home. The following morning, Swirling visits Cain in his cell at the police station and informs him that they questioned Ryan and released him and that they believed that Cain had acted alone. Swirling warns Cain that he faces a long prison sentence but Cain is defiant and taunts Swirling, saying that they have no evidence against him and that they should release him. Swirling ignores him and leaves the cell. Later Charity comes to the police station to change her statement and tells Swirling that she is longer certain that it was Cain who carried out the burglary. Swirling tells Charity that if she lets Cain get away with it then she will never be free of him but she ignores him and Swirling has no choice but to release Cain.

He hires aspiring journalist [[Jasmine Thomas]] for her village knowledge.

In November 2008, he covers the new village choir's attempts to enter a competition; and in December Jasmine demands her article about the local criminal family the McFarlane's is changed to a story about the church.

Frank Bernard - normally referred to by both names - arrives in Emmerdale having just been released from prison for [[rape|raping]] one of Pearl's neighbours, having previously been accused by a colleague but the case was dropped due to a lack of evidence. Many villagers do not take kindly to having a rapist living amongst them, and some either shun or harass him. 

When [[Donna Windsor-Dingle|Donna Windsor]] has an accident on her scooter, Frank Bernard goes to see if she is all right. Donna panics when she sees him and runs to her brother [[Scott Windsor|Scott]]. He and [[Syd Woolfe]] then set upon Frank Bernard, thinking he had harmed Donna, and leave him for dead on a roadside. Frank Bernard is later discovered by [[Rodney Blackstock]] and [[Danny Daggert]], who take him to his mother's home. He refuses to give the names of his attackers. He then decides to leave the village for his mother's sake.

The scene where Scott and Syd beat up Frank Bernard attracted 27 complaints. However, [[Ofcom]] ruled that Emmerdale were not in breach of any broadcasting codes as the scenes were edited in a careful manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Luke Dingle''' is the eldest son of [[Lilith Dingle]]. He appeared in 2004, and from 2006 to 2007.

Luke first visits Emmerdale in October 2004 for a Dingle family celebration to mark their 10th anniversary of living in the village. His mother Lilith then leaves Luke and his siblings to live with her cousin [[Marlon Dingle]] for a month. Luke returns in 2006 when Lilith leaves her children with Marlon and his wife [[Donna Windsor-Dingle|Donna]] while she goes away to work. Days later Lilith is arrested for armed robbery. On his first day at Hotten Comprehensive School, Luke gets into a fight with [[Victoria Sugden]] after she makes a remark about his mother being in custody. 

Marlon tells social services that he is having difficulties looking after them, so its agreed that they will go and stay with their uncle, Tony. They are soon informed that the children have gone missing, and are soon found in a nearby woodland. The following day they are taken into foster care. Marlon and Donna desperately try to get the children back but first have to find suitable accommodation. This finally happens when they buy Tall Tree Cottage, and the children move in with them on 5 July. However, the case against their mother collapses and on 13 July 2007 she takes them all to [[Ireland]] with her, much to Donna and Marlon's distress.
