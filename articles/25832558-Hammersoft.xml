[[Admiral (Royal Navy)|Admiral]] '''Sir William George &quot;Bill&quot; Tennant''' [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath|KCB]] [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] [[Member of the Royal Victorian Order|MVO]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (2 January 1890 &amp;ndash; 26 July 1963) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] naval officer. He was lauded for overseeing the successful [[evacuation of Dunkirk]] in 1940. Tennant subsequently served as captain of the battlecruiser [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']],  when it searched for German capital ships in the Atlantic. He remained in this capacity when the ''Repulse'' was [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sunk by the Japanese]] along with [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] in the [[South China Sea]] on 10 December 1941, three days after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]]. He later aided in the setup of the [[Mulberry harbour]]s and the [[Operation Pluto|Pluto pipelines]], a crucial part of the success of [[Operation Overlord]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Upton-upon-Severn]], Tennant joined the Royal Navy at age 15 in 1905,&lt;ref name=lh&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/TENNANT.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; serving onboard [[HMS Britannia (1904)|HMS ''Britannia'']], eventually specializing in navigation in 1913.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He later served in the [[First World War]] during the [[Gallipoli campaign]] and survived the sinking of his ship at the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. After the war, Tennant joined the crew of [[HMS Renown (1916)|HMS ''Renown'']] and his future command, HMS ''Repulse'', during the future [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VIII]]'s royal tours in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; By 1932, Tennant had achieved the rank of Captain.

==World War II==
{{main|Dunkirk evacuation}}

===Dunkirk Evacuation===
On 26 May 1940, Captain Tennant was dispatched onboard the destroyer [[HMS Wolfhound (L56)|HMS ''Wolfhound'']] to [[Dunkirk]] to aid in the evacuation of more than 300,000 British and French troops left stranded when France fell to the Nazis.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; Tennant's task was to organize these dispirited men and get them onto the [[Little ships of Dunkirk|boats waiting to take them]]. Tennant stayed right up until the last boats left on 2 June, patrolling the beaches of Dunkirk with a megaphone searching for British troops.

Tennant was lauded for his efforts at Dunkirk, and was appointed [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] on 7 June 1940. The ordinary sailors under his command took to calling him &quot;Dunkirk Joe&quot;.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

===Captain of the ''Repulse''===
On 28 June Tennant became captain of the battlecruiser ''Repulse'',&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; taking part in battles against the German battleships [[German battleship Scharnhorst|''Scharnhorst'']] and [[German battleship Gneisenau|''Gneisenau'']], and later in the hunt for the battleship [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/4065.html HMS Repulse (34) - Battlecruiser of the Renown class - Allied warships of WWII - uboat.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loss of the ''Repulse''===
{{main|Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse}}
Tennant and ''Repulse'' joined Admiral Sir [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Tom Phillips]]' [[Force Z]], sent to Singapore to counter Japanese aggression in the Pacific, in December 1941. On 8 December, the day after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], Singapore came under attack by Japanese air units, and Force Z departed for Malaya to attack a Japanese convoy, an operation that was cancelled shortly thereafter. Upon returning to Singapore, they received word of Japanese landings on Malaya, and Force Z - without air cover - made for Malaya to counter them.

On 10 December the Japanese attacked Force Z. Tennant ably managed to avoid nineteen torpedoes dropped from Japanese aircraft, but ''Repulse'' eventually succumbed to a pincer attack, taking five torpedoes; she sunk within twenty minutes, taking a great deal of the crew with her. The survivors, including Captain Tennant, were rescued by [[HMAS Vampire (D68)|HMAS ''Vampire'']], one of the destroyers in Force Z.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forcez-survivors.org.uk/sinking2.html The Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normandy===
In June 1944, Tennant - now an admiral - was placed in charge of the naval side of the transport, assembly and setup of the two [[Mulberry harbour]]s that provided port facilities for the coming [[invasion of Normandy]].&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; In August, he supervised the laying of the [[Operation Pluto|Pluto]] pipelines between France and England, which provided much needed fuel supplies for the ongoing conflict. For his efforts in the success of the Normandy invasion, Tennant was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]], and also received the United States [[Legion of Merit]].

==Post-war service==
Tennant was promoted to [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in 1945 for his war service, and made commander of the [[North America and West Indies Station|America and West Indies Station]] after the war ended, and remained there until he retired in 1949&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; as a full admiral. In 1950, he was named [[Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire]], serving until his death at the Worcester Royal Infirmary in 1963.

==In popular culture==
In the TV series [[Dunkirk (TV series)|''Dunkirk'']], Captain Tennant is played by [[Adrian Rawlins]].
