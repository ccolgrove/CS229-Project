==Athletic Songs==
According to a March 2008 edition of the Voyager, UWF will have a fight song once SGA decides through voting.

==Mascot==
UWF's official mascot is the [[Argonaut]], a mythical group of Greek sailors, who accompanied Jason to Colchis in his quest for the Golden Fleece. However, the official logo of the institution is the Chambered Nautilus; because of this, students jokingly refer to themselves as the UWF &quot;Fighting Snails.&quot;

==Possibility of a Football Program, Moving to NCAA Division I==
According to local papers, UWF has recently created an &quot;Athletics Visioning Team&quot; for 2009. The purpose of this team is to find out whether or not the time is now appropriate for UWF to move its athletic programs up to NCAA Division I, and/or possibly add a football program.&lt;ref&gt;Pensacola News Journal - [http://www.pnj.com/article/20090106/SPORTS/901060324/1002 UWF Aims to Boost Athletics]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2010, UWF President Judith Bense announced that she will make a decision regarding adding football by Summer 2011 and that the University had committed to playing in [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] for at least the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goargos.com/article.asp?articleID=3735 UWF President to Make Decision on Football by Summer 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
