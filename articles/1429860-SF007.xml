'''Moneybookers''' is an [[e-commerce]] business that allows payments and money transfers to be made through the [[Internet]]. It serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods such as cheques and [[money order]]s. Moneybookers performs payment processing for websites, online [[auction]] sites, and other [[corporation|corporate]] users. In 2011, Moneybookers announced that they would be rebranding their service as Skrill by the following year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moneybookers.com/app/skrill.pl&lt;/ref&gt;

Moneybookers was bought by [[Investcorp|Investcorp Technology Partners]] for [[Euro|â¬]]105 Million in March 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;Investcorp&quot; /&gt; and as of the 9 March 2009 has been put up for sale by its owners Investcorp for an estimated Â£365m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/4963091/Investcorp-to-sell-Moneybookers.html Telegraph.co.uk], Investcorp to sell Moneybookers&lt;/ref&gt;

Like  many competing online fund transfer services (e.g., [[PayPal]]), Moneybookers requires identity verification before using their service to minimize fraud and prevent [[money laundering]]. Additional verification steps raise the maximum amount transferable to [[Euro|â¬]]50,000 or equivalent within a 90-day period. Moneybookers does not usually get involved in merchandise disputes and the availability of credit card [[chargeback]]s may be limited. 

More than 100,000 [[merchants]] are registered with Moneybookers and its [[payments systems]] are integrated by global online brands such as [[Facebook]], [[Skype]] and [[eBay]]. In February 2010, The [[Sunday Times]] Deloitte Buyout Track 100 League table ranked Moneybookers as the Number #1 fastest growing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/private-equity/0af9990e09996210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm Number 1 fastest growing]&lt;/ref&gt;, private equity-backed firm in the [[UK]] based on profits.

==History==
The moneybookers.com domain was created June 17, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;whois database&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reports.internic.net/cgi/whois?whois_nic=moneybookers.com&amp;type=domain|title=whois record |date=2009-10-12|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was launched on 1 April 2002 according to the Moneybookers press center.&lt;ref name=&quot;press release&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moneybookers.com/app/presscentre.pl?action=show&amp;news_id=1|title=Moneybookers.com |date=2002-01-04|accessdate=2009-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 2 million new users registered with Moneybookers in the initial 1.5 years of operation. On the 2nd September 2008, Moneybookers claimed to operate in all countries and handle over 5.5 million accounts. As of 27 January 2010, Moneybookers claims to have over 14.8 million account holders.

==Business today==
Moneybookers offers fully integrated worldwide banking network, provides more than 100 payment options, with 41 currencies covering 200 countries and territories. Reached 10 million account holders in December 2009. Currently has more than 18.5 million customers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moneybookers-company-profile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxcompared.com/blog/foreign-currency-companies/moneybookers-company-profile/ |title=Moneybookers Company Profile }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Moneybookers' US customers cannot receive money and foreign customers cannot upload funds using cards or accounts located in the US. Moneybookers also offers [[escrow]] payments (for online trading) as well as online [[SMS]] and fax sending services.

As of February 2009, Moneybookers US-based division &quot;Moneybookers USA Inc.&quot; has been integrated on eBay.com as an official [[eBay]] payment provider in response to antitrust concerns.

Moneybookers.com reserves the right to lock any account at any time. Further they also reserve the right to impose a fee on any account at any time when a customer violates the terms and conditions they have agreed with upon registration. This information is stated within their terms and conditions.

==Banking Status==
Moneybookers is registered as a Money Service Business (No. 12115607) with [[HM Revenue and Customs]] in the United Kingdom, and is licensed to operate within the [[European Union|EU]]. Moneybookers is regulated by the [[Financial Services Authority]] of the United Kingdom.

==WikiLeaks Controversy==
Moneybookers collected donations for [[WikiLeaks]], the whistleblower website known for publishing secret documents. In August 2010, Moneybookers blocked funding for WikiLeaks (despite the fact that no court order has been issued), telling the site that their account had been closed &quot;to comply with money laundering or other investigations conducted by government authorities.&quot; Further correspondence from Moneybookers stated: &quot;Following recent publicity and the subsequently addition of the WikiLeaks entity to blacklists in Australia and watchlists in the USA, we have terminated the business relationship.'&quot; WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] stated: &quot;This is likely to cause a huge backlash against Moneybookers. Craven behavior in relation to the US government is unlikely to be seen sympathetically.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/oct/14/wikileaks-says-funding-is-blocked WikiLeaks says funding has been blocked after government blacklisting] ''The Guardian'', 14 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebranding==
By summer in 2012 a new website and improved payment facilities will be launched along with a complete adoption of '''Skrill'''; dropping the Moneybookers brand. For existing merchants, all current functionality will remain available, however, Skrill recommends updating logos on checkout pages. Co-[[CEO]] of Skrill [[Martin Ott]] ''said on Newsblaze &quot;The Real Time News&quot; Skrill is a universal payment brand that works well internationally and has been optimized to standout and ultimately aid conversion at checkout pages of online-shops. It stands for liberating and simplifying the previously complex process of payments, offering a safe and innovative way for consumers to pay for goods online.''{{cn|date=October 2011}}
