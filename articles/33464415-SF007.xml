The '''version history''' of the '''[[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]''' began with the release of Android 1.0 in September 2008. Android is a [[mobile operating system]] developed by [[Google]] and the [[Open Handset Alliance]], and has seen a number of [[patch (computing)|updates]] since its original release. These updates to the base [[operating system]] typically fix [[software bug|bugs]] and add new features.

The pre-release versions of Android were dubbed Astro and Bender, but these names could not ultimately be used for [[trademark]] reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Development Team |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIIni_4fC60 |title=Google Keynote at AnDevCon II |date=09 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
