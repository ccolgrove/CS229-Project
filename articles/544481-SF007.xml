'''''The Seven Crystal Balls''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Les 7 boules de cristal'''}}) is the thirteenth of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', a series of classic comic-strip albums, written and illustrated by Belgian writer and illustrator [[HergÃ©]], featuring young reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] as a hero.

It was first published in the ''[[Le Soir]]'' newspaper from December 1943 to September 1944 but was postponed three-quarters of the way through when, following the liberation of Belgium at the end of [[World War II]], HergÃ© and other members of the ''Le Soir'' were investigated for working for a [[collaborationist]] newspaper. The story was resumed in ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]'' in the newly-launched ''[[Tintin magazine]]'' in 1946.

== Synopsis ==

On board a train, Tintin reads a newspaper article about [[Sanders-Hardiman Expedition Members|seven explorers]] who have returned from a two-year [[ethnography|ethnographic]] expedition in the [[Andes]], where they unearthed the tomb of the [[Inca]], [[Rascar Capac]]. A man says to him, &quot;''Think of all those Egyptologists, dying in mysterious circumstances after they'd opened the tomb of the pharaoh...You wait, the same will happen to those busybodies violating the Inca's burial chamber.''&quot;

Tintin's train arrives at [[Marlinspike Hall]], the new home of his friends [[Captain Haddock]] and [[Professor Calculus]]. The Captain, now a member of the aristocracy, invites Tintin to an evening at the [[music hall]]. There they witness an unsettling performance of a clairvoyant who predicts the illness of one of the members of the expedition. They also view the act of [[Bianca Castafiore]], as well as a knife throwerâwhom Tintin recognizes is [[General Alcazar]] of [[San Theodoros]]. They have a glass of [[aguardiente]] with the general who introduces them to his assistant [[Chiquito (Tintin character)|Chiquito]].

A mysterious illness begins afflicting the members of the expedition; one by one, they fall into a mysterious [[coma]]. The only clue is fragments of a shattered [[crystal ball]] found near each victim. Concerned, Tintin, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus go to stay with Calculus's old friend and only expedition member yet to be affected, the ebullient Professor Tarragon. Tarragon is keeping Rascar Capac's mummy in his house and is being tightly guarded against any attack. A lightning storm strikes the house and sends a [[Ball lightning|ball of fire]] down the chimney and onto the mummyâwhich evaporates. Tarragon, clearly shaken, informs them a prophecy has come true: Rascar Capac has returned to his element and punishment will descend upon the desecrators.

After Tintin, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus are each visited in their nightmares by the mummy, the three awaken to find Professor Tarragon comatose with the telltale shards of crystal by his bed. The attacker bypassed the police watch by coming down the chimney. The police shoot the attacker as he flees, but fail to capture him. Tintin states the crystal balls have done their work and claimed the last of the seven.

Tarragon awakens and screams about mysterious figures attacking him, before slipping back into a coma. The plot thickens even further when Calculus takes a stroll around Professor Tarragon's house, discovers a striking gold bracelet, puts it on (remarking on how nicely it goes with his coat), and then mysteriously disappears. The bracelet had previously been worn by the now-vanished mummy.

While searching the grounds, Tintin and Haddock discover the attacker had eluded them by taking refuge in a tree and deduce that he then jumped Calculus and stole the mummy's jewels. Tintin and the Captain are then fired upon by an unseen gunman who escapes, having kidnapped Calculus, in a black car. The alarm is raised and the police set up road blocks, but the kidnappers switch cars and slip through the net.

Tintin visits a hospital where all seven of the stricken explorers go through the same horrorâthey awaken from their coma, scream about figures attacking them, and slip back into their comaâat a precise time of day.

Back at Marlinspike Hall, Captain Haddock is devastated by the loss of Professor Calculus. But after he receives a telephone call from the police, he disappears into his bedroom, then reappearsâdressed as a sailor again and ready for travel. As he and Tintin drive to Westermouth, he explains the kidnapper's car was seen there; he believes the kidnappers boarded a ship with Calculus and he intends to follow. When they reach the docks, they find the kidnapper's car abandoned and they spot General Alcazar boarding a ship to [[South America]]. The General informs them his music hall career is over since the disappearance of his partner, Chiquito, one of the last descendants of the Incas. Tintin realizes Chiquito disappeared the same night Professor Tarragon was attacked and Calculus kidnapped and deduces he could be one of the kidnappers.

Out of leads, Tintin and Haddock decide to go to a different dock, Bridgeport, to visit Haddock's friend, [[Captain Chester]]. [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]] retrieves an old hat found there, and Tintin recognizes it as belonging to Professor Calculus. Checking with the harbour master, they discover that Calculus must be on board the ''[[Pachacamac]]'', which is bound for [[Peru]]. They board a flight and resolve to meet his ship there.

The story is continued in ''[[Prisoners of the Sun]]''.

==Background==
''The Seven Crystal Balls'' was written during [[World War II]]. With [[Belgium]] under [[Germany|German]] occupation, HergÃ© decided to avoid the overt political content that he had included in previous Tintin stories, such as ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', ''[[The Broken Ear]]'' and ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]''.

As the opening sequence of the book indicates, ''The Seven Crystal Balls'' and its theme of an ancient curse, was inspired by the &quot;[[curse of the pharaohs]]&quot;, the speculation that members of the [[Howard Carter]] expedition, discoverers of the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]], died in tragic and mysterious ways due to a curse.

==Publication history==
For Professor Taragon's residence, HergÃ©'s collaborator [[Edgar P. Jacobs]] suggested a house he knew in [[Boitsfort]]. The two artists went there and made sketches of the house which appeared to be empty. It was only when they were leaving that they realised that the place was actually being used by the local [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and was full of soldiers. However, they were able to slip away without any trouble.&lt;ref name=TintinTheCompleteCompanion /&gt;

The original serial version began regular publication in the Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]'' on 16 December 1943. It was suspended on 3 September 1944, following the liberation of [[Brussels]], when HergÃ© and many of his colleagues had to answer for working for the [[collaborationist]] newspaper.

The strip ended with Tintin walking through the street reading a newspaper when he collides with [[General Alcazar]]. Alcazar tells him that he is now unemployed since the disappearance of his assistant Chiquito and how Chiquito is in fact a descendant of the Incas.&lt;ref name=TintinTheCompleteCompanion&gt;''Tintin The Complete Companion'' by [[Michael Farr]], ISBN 0719555221, ISBN 978-0719555220&lt;/ref&gt; Tintin then describes to him the man who was driving the car in which Calculus is believed to have been transferred to during the kidnapping. Alcazar identifies him as Fernando Ramirez, a major exporter of [[guano]] whom Chiquito knew well. Tintin then rushes him to the police station in order to make a statement.

Publication resumed in the newly-launched ''[[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin Magazine]]'' in 1946, under the title ''Le Temple du Soleil'' (French for &quot;Temple of the Sun&quot; but renamed ''Prisoners of the Sun'' in English). It begins with Tintin on his way to Marlinspike Hall where Haddock is in a state of depression over Calculus' disappearance. This and his sudden leap into action is said to be reflecting HergÃ©'s mood at the time: his uncertain future due to the accusations of collaboration and the subsequent offer to help launch ''Tintin Magazine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TintinTheCompleteCompanion&quot;/&gt; (The scene with Alcazar would be re-located to a city port with the General about to set off to South America himself in order to lead an uprising and denying all knowledge of the driver in the car).

==Connections with other books==
Tintin telephones Professor Paul Cantonneau to warn him about the danger of falling victim to one of the crystal balls. He and Tintin had known each other in the expedition of ''[[The Shooting Star]]'': Cantonneau had been on the receiving end of Tintin's suitcase, thrown down from the crow's nest by [[Philippulus the Prophet]].

The nightmare of a South American native stalking a Westerner in his bedroom had been used before by HergÃ© in the original black-and-white publication of ''[[The Broken Ear]]'' (though it is not included in the present edition most commonly available today).

[[General Alcazar]] of ''[[The Broken Ear]]'' and [[Bianca Castafiore]] of ''[[King Ottokar's Sceptre]]'' also appear in the music-hall scenes. For Castafiore, this seems sharply at odds with all her other appearances in the ''Tintin'' series, where she is depicted as one of the world's leading operatic divas; not a music hall variety act. In a significant continuity error by the translators (which does not occur in the original version), Tintin observes that Castafiore &quot;turns up&quot; in unlikely locations, including &quot;Syldavia, Borduria, and the Red Sea&quot;. At this point in the chronology of the series, Tintin has only met Castafiore once before, in Syldavia during the adventure King Ottokar's Sceptre. The adventures featuring Castafiore in Borduria (''The Calculus Affair'') and the Red Sea (''The Red Sea Sharks'') are in Tintin's future. Plus, Haddock appears to know Castafiore, yet he has never encountered her previously in the published series (however, he might have seen her at a previous evening at the Music Hall).
Alcazar and Castafiore were to guest-star in other adventures, including ''[[Tintin and the Picaros]]''.

The two boys, one blonde, the other dark-haired, who hide a brick in a hat as a prank on Captain Haddock, were quite likely inspired by HergÃ©'s own [[Quick &amp; Flupke]], another pair of young troublemakers.
