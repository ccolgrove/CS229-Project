*Some do not consider this episode to be canon to the show due to SpongeBob having failed his driving test over one million times. This number is ridiculously huge and would require an extremely long amount of time to take and fail each test, more than occupies one's lifetime, despite SpongeBob still being young. In &quot;[[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 4)#Driven to Tears .2F Rule of Dumb|Driven to Tears]]&quot;, SpongeBob has failed his driving test 57 times (meaning he has failed it 19 more times prior to [[Boating School]], a much smaller and more logical number). But, the &quot;million times&quot; saying may also be a figure of speech.
