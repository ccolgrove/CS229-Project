'''Bombay Bicycle Club''' are a British [[indie rock]] and folk band from [[Crouch End]], [[London]]. The band comprises: Jack Steadman (lead vocals, guitar), Jamie MacColl (guitar), Ed Nash (bass) and Suren de Saram (drums).

The band were asked to play the opening performance of 2006's [[V Festival]] after winning [[Channel 4]]'s &quot;Road to V&quot; competition. Following the release of two [[Extended play|EP]]s and their debut single &quot;[[Evening/Morning]]&quot;, the band recorded their debut album, ''[[I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose]]''. The album was released on 6 July 2009.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Steadman, MacColl, Roberts [?] and de Saram were 15 when they started playing under the name ''The Canals'' and switched between various aliases until they picked Bombay Bicycle Club, named after a chain of [[India]]n [[restaurant]]s in London. The line-up changed regularly until summer 2006, when Nash joined the band. They played gigs at school and at small London venues such as The Old Blue Last, Lark in the Park and Jacksons Lane.

The band were entered into [[Virgin Mobile]]'s &quot;Road to V&quot; competition on Channel 4 in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/92786/bombay_bicycle_club|title=Bombay Bicycle Club - Dust On The Ground|accessdate=2009-07-24|date=2009-07-21|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were announced as one of two winners of the competition on 16 August 2006, beating competition from fellow [[London]] band - and favourites to win the competition - [[The Holloways]] in the final round of fourteen bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC MusicOMH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/music/features/bombay-bicycle-club_0307.htm|title=Bombay Bicycle Club - MusicOMH|publisher=musicOMH|accessdate=2008-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous participants include [[Young Knives|The Young Knives]], who were winners of the inaugural competition one year before.
