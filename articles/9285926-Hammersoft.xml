'''Brookby''' is a rural suburb of [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. Brookby is approximately 5 kilometres west of Clevedon and 5 km southeast of [[Whitford, New Zealand|Whitford]]. Originally established as a farming community with few people living in the area, Brookby is now a fast-growing community. It has a well established school and lots of newly built houses within the area. The suburb is in the Franklin ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of Auckland City.


Brookby was originally named Turanga Creek, until early residents realised their mail was being sent to Tauranga instead.{{Fact|date=July 2008}} The original post-office was located near a Brook (Papakura Stream), and so was named by the brook, or Brookby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brookby.school.nz/features/|title=Our History|publisher=Brookby Primary School|accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
