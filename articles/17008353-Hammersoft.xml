The '''Evansville Purple Aces''' represent the [[University of Evansville]] in [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] sports.

==Purple Aces and Ace Purple==
The University of Evansville's nickname, the Aces, was acquired after an opposing coach cracked a joke after losing to the Evansville College Pioneers in the 1920s. Dan Scism, the sportswriter credited with first using the name 'Aces' in headlines, said he did so at the suggestion of basketball coach John Harmon in 1926. &quot;Prior to that the Aces had been called Pioneers,&quot; Scism said, &quot;but Coach Harmon suggested I call them the Aces because he was told by Louisville's coach that he didn't have four aces up his sleeve, he had five!&quot;

Forty years after Aces came into being, mascot 'Ace Purple' was created by ''Evansville Press'' artist Larry Hill. Ace Purple is a turn-of-the century [[riverboat]] [[gambler]], appropriate since Evansville is located on the banks of the [[Ohio River]]. However, the first Ace Purple was a rough, mean-looking character who did not go over well with Aces' fans. Artist Keith Butz softened 'Ace' in 1977 into a smiling, friendly figure who remains popular with young and old alike.

==Intercollegiate teams==
UE athletics &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gopurpleaces.com GoPurpleAces.com]&lt;/ref&gt; now include 14 NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] varsity sports, eight for women and six for men. They include women's [[tennis]], men's and women's [[cross country running|cross country]], men's and women's [[golf]], men's and women's [[basketball]], men's and women's [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] &amp; [[diving]], men's and women's [[soccer]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], and women's [[volleyball]].

===Baseball===
Four players from the Purple Aces baseball team have appeared in [[Major League Baseball]]: [[Andy Benes]], [[Sal Fasano]], [[Jamey Carroll]], and [[Rob Maurer]].

===Men's Basketball===
{{main|Evansville Purple Aces men's basketball}}
{{See also|Evansville basketball plane crash}}
The University of Evansville athletics department was built upon a foundation of success in men's [[basketball]]. In the early years of the men's basketball program the Purple Aces appeared in the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] national tournament. The Purple Aces appeared 4 times in the [[NAIA national men's basketball championship|NAIA Tournament]] ([[1941 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1941]], [[1942 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1942]], [[1951 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1951]], and [[1955 NAIA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1955]]). The Purple Aces had a NAIA tournament record of 3-4. The furthest distance Evansville got in the NAIA tournaments was in third round (NAIA Quarterfinals) in 1951, only to lose to [[Regis University|Regis University (Colo.)]] 70-68 &lt;ref&gt;[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/naia/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/mensd1champhistory.pdf NAIA Championship History]&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Shortly after the 1955 season the Purple Aces would move up to the NCAA College Division, now called NCAA [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]]. The Purple Aces would have much better success in their new division. Winning national championships in [[1959 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1959]], [[1960 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1960]], [[1964 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1964]], [[1965 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1965]] and [[1971 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament|1971]]. The team was led by legendary coach [[Arad McCutchan]] from 1946 to 1977 who led the Purple Aces to a 515-313 record. 

In 1977 UE began playing in NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] athletics. That same year on December 13, a chartered [[DC-3]] carrying the entire UE basketball team [[Evansville basketball plane crash|crashed]] in a field near the [[Evansville Regional Airport]] en route to a game against [[Middle Tennessee State University|Middle Tennessee State]]. Every member of the team and coaching staff on the plane was killed. One player was not able to attend the game and thus was not on the plane; not long after the plane crash, however, the player who was not on the plane was killed in a car accident along with his younger brother. To remember that team, Memorial Plaza stands in the middle of campus between Olmsted Administration Hall and the site of the new University Center, crowned by a fountain with the names engraved. Additionally engraved is the following inscription: &quot;Out of the agony of this hour we will rise.&quot; Middle Tennessee and Evansville eventually had their first meeting on November 24, 2010.

Tremendous community support brought back the basketball program the next year, and in the relatively short time at the Division I level, the Purple Aces have made five trips to the NCAA Men's basketball tournament ([[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1982]], [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]], [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1993]], [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]]) &lt;ref&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_champs_records/2008/d1/champs.pdf NCAA Basketball History]&lt;/ref&gt; and two trips to the NIT ([[1998 National Invitation Tournament|1998]], [[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nit.org/history/nit-postseason.html NIT Postseason History]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Women's Basketball===
The University of Evansville women's basketball team (the Lady Aces) have made two trips to the NCAA basketball tournament ([[1999 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]], [[2009 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/w_basketball_champs_records/2005/2005_w_basketball_champ_record.pdf NCAA Women's Basketball History]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Football===

Evansville currently operates as an NCAA Division I Club sport for football. The Purple Aces were previously a fully funded NCAA Division I program. Talk has existed since 2007 upgrading football again to a fully funded NCAA Division I team.

==School spirit==
In 2000, the University adopted a new athletics logo that did away with the old Ace Purple logo (pictured). However, the University made sure that Ace Purple remained as a big part of home athletic events. To this day, a University of Evansville student is chosen during try-outs in August to don the Ace Purple mascot costume at all major home athletic events.

The athletic teams are supported by the university's dance team, cheer squad, and a pep band, the [[Aces Brass]].
