'''Earl Sidney Weaver''' (born August 14, 1930 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[manager (baseball)|manager]]. He spent his entire 17-year managerial career with the [[Baltimore Orioles]] (1968&amp;ndash;1982; 1985&amp;ndash;1986). Weaver was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[1996 in baseball|1996]].

==Playing career==
After playing for Beaumont High School in St. Louis, the 17-year-old Weaver was signed by his hometown [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 1948 as a [[second baseman]]. A slick fielder but never much of a hitter, he worked his way up to the [[Texas League]] [[Houston Buffaloes]] (two steps below the majors) in 1951, but never made the big club. Weaver was later traded to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] organization, then moved on to the Orioles, where he began his managing career.

His Hall of Fame pitcher [[Jim Palmer]], who battled with Weaver on a regular basis, once noted: &quot;The only thing that Earl knows about a curve ball is he couldn't hit it.&quot;{{Fact|date=June 2011}} After Palmer's skills began to decline and he was no longer a regular starter, Weaver defended his actions by claiming he'd given Palmer &quot;more chances than my ex-wife.&quot;{{Fact|date=June 2011}} He has also directed such a remark at [[Mike Cuellar]], ace of the 1969 staff, and several other players.{{Fact|date=June 2011}}

==Managerial career==
Weaver started his minor league managerial career in 1956 with the unaffiliated Knoxville Smokies in the South Atlantic League. He joined the Orioles in 1957 as skipper of their [[Fitzgerald, Georgia|Fitzgerald]] club in the [[Georgia-Florida League]]. The Orioles moved him to their [[Dublin, Georgia]] franchise in 1958, and to their [[Aberdeen, South Dakota]] club in 1959. 1960 found Weaver in Wisconsin managing the Fox Cities Foxes in the Class B Three-I League. He moved up to with the AA [[Elmira Pioneers]] in 1962 and to the AAA [[Rochester Red Wings]] in 1966.

As a [[minor league baseball|minor league]] pilot, he compiled a record of 841 wins and 697 defeats (.547) with three championships in 11Â½ seasons. He was promoted to the Orioles as their first-base [[coach (baseball)|coach]] in [[1968 in baseball|1968]], and spent a half-season in that role before taking the managerial reins in July.

During his tenure as big-league skipper, the Orioles won six Eastern Division titles, four [[American League]] pennants, and a [[1970 World Series|World Series]] championship. Weaver's managerial record is 1,480&amp;ndash;1,060 (.583), including 100+ win seasons in 1969 (109), 1970 (108), 1971 (101), 1979 (102), and 1980 (100). He only had one losing season in his managerial career, with the 1986 Orioles.

In 1989, Weaver returned to managing, helming the [[Gold Coast Suns (baseball)|Gold Coast Suns]] in new [[Senior Professional Baseball Association]]. The Suns failed to make the playoffs in the 1989-90 season and folded after one season.

===Disciplinary actions===
Weaver was ejected from games at least 91 times during the regular season (98, according to one source&lt;ref name=&quot;caple&quot;&gt;Caple, J (August 21, 2003): Piniella, Weaver amongst kings of confrontation. [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Q7J3sgrj5eoJ:sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story%3Fcolumnist%3Dcaple_jim%26id%3D1599882+earl+weaver+faked+heart+attack&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari&amp;source=www.google.com ESPN archive] Retrieved August 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) and several more times during post-season play. He was ejected from both ends of a doubleheader three times. He was ejected before a game started twice (both times by [[Ron Luciano]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bang&quot;&gt;Luciano, R (February 22, 1982): &quot;Bang! Bang! You're Out. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1125259/index.htm ''Sports Illustrated'' archive] Retrieved August 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;).  Luciano alone ejected him from all four games of a minor-league series and eight games in the majors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ump&quot;&gt;Luciano, Ron (March 1, 1982): The Ump and the Manager. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1125274/1/index.htm ''Sports Illustrated'' archive] Retrieved August 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He also received four multiple-game suspensions.   He was well known for the humor that often accompanied his ejections. During one particular tirade with an umpire, Weaver headed to the dugout screaming, &quot;I'm going to check the rule-book on that&quot; to which the umpire replied, &quot;Here, use mine.&quot; Weaver shot back, &quot;That's no good - I can't read Braille.&quot; {{Fact|date=June 2011}}  He once told an umpire that he could appear on ''[[What's My Line?]]'' wearing his mask, chest protector and ball/strike indicator and still nobody would guess he was an umpire.&lt;ref name=&quot;caple&quot;/&gt;

Weaver had a penchant for kicking dirt on umpires, and for turning his cap backwards whenever he sparred with umpires in order to get as close to them as possible without actually touching them.{{Fact|date=June 2011}} His rivalry with Luciano was legendary, to the point where the AL rearranged umpiring schedules for an entire year so that Luciano would not work Orioles games. In the third inning of Luciano's first game in Baltimore a year later, he ejected Weaverâwho then publicly questioned Luciano's &quot;integrity&quot; and received a three-game suspension.&lt;ref name=&quot;bang&quot;/&gt; Still, Weaver had respect for Luciano, calling him &quot;one of the few umpires that people have paid their way into the park to see.&quot;{{Fact|date=June 2011}}

[[Marty Springstead]] was one of Weaver's least favorite umpires.  On September 15, 1977, in Toronto, Weaver asked umpire Springstead to have a tarpaulin covering the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] bullpen area removed; the tarp was weighed down by bricks and Weaver argued that his left fielder could be injured if he ran into the bricks while chasing a foul ball. When the umpire refused to order the Blue Jays to move the tarp, Weaver pulled the Orioles off the field, forcing the umpire to declare a forfeit: the only forfeit in Orioles history.  On another infamous occasion, in Cleveland, Springstead watched as Weaver tore up the rule book and tossed it into the air.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.masnsports.com/school_of_roch/2010/09/revisiting-sept-15-1977.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

One of Weaver's most infamous tirades came on September 17, 1980 in a game against the [[Detroit Tigers]].  First base umpire [[Bill Haller]], who was wearing a microphone for a documentary on the daily life of an MLB umpire, called a [[balk]] on Oriole pitcher [[Mike Flanagan (baseball)|Mike Flanagan]].  Weaver charged out of the dugout and began screaming at Haller, who was already angry at Weaver for publicly questioning his honesty by suggesting he be prohibited from working Tigers games because his brother was the Tigers' catcher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ump&quot;/&gt;  After Weaver was ejected, he launched into a profanity-filled argument with Haller that was duly recorded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl-4FSRYagc&lt;/ref&gt; Weaver's contempt for umpires was often mutual.  One night in 1973 Weaver threw his cap to the ground and began a vehement argument with Luciano.  Luciano's crew-mate [[Don Denkinger]] walked over to Weaver's cap, stepped on it with the sharp cleats of both shoes, and slowly twisted back and forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ump&quot;/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Weaver's oft-quoted managerial philosophy was &quot;Double-plays and the Three Run Homer.&quot; Weaver eschewed the use of so-called &quot;[[inside baseball]]&quot; tactics such as the [[stolen base]], the [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]], or the [[sacrifice bunt]], preferring a patient approach (&quot;waiting for the home run&quot;), saying &quot;If you play for one run, that's all you'll get&quot; and &quot;On offense, your most precious possessions are your 27 outs&quot;. Weaver claims to have never had a sign for the [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]], citing that the play makes both the baserunner and the hitter vulnerable, as the baserunner is susceptible to being caught [[stealing]] and the hitter is required to swing at any pitch thrown no matter how far outside the strike zone or how unhittable the pitch is.

Weaver strongly believed in finishing as high in the standings as possible, even if a championship was not involved: In 1977, the Orioles entered the final weekend of the season tied for second place in the AL East with the Red Sox, three games behind the division-leading Yankees, to play a scheduled three-game series against the Red Sox in Boston, while the Yankees played three at home against Detroit.  The Red Sox won the first game of the series, 11-10, on September 30, eliminating the Orioles from division title contention; however, after the game Weaver insisted, in an interview with a reporter, that &quot;we're still trying to finish second.&quot;  The following day, the Orioles won, 8-7, eliminating the Red Sox (the Yankees having lost on both days) and leaving the teams tied for second place headed into the series' and the season's final game, which was rained out, resulting in the Red Sox and Orioles finishing in a tie for second place.

Weaver also insisted that his players maintain a professional appearance at all times. He allowed mustaches, but not beards, and, as a rule, players had to wear a suit or jacket and tie on board an airplane for a road trip.{{Fact|date=June 2011}}

===Use of statistics===
Weaver made extensive use of statistics to create matchups that were favorable either for his batter or his pitcher. He had various notebooks with all sorts of splits and head-to-head numbers for his batters and against his pitchers and would assemble his lineups according to the matchups he had. For example, despite the fact that [[Gold Glove]] [[shortstop]] [[Mark Belanger]] was an inept hitter by any objective standard, in 19 [[plate appearances]] he hit .625 with a .684 on-base percentage and .625 slugging percentage against Jim Kern and would be slotted high in the lineup when facing him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/b-pvb.cgi?n1=belanma01#minPA2=19&amp;minPA=19&amp;n1=belanma01&amp;as=batter&amp;year_game=career&amp;orderby=Name Mark Belanger Batting vs. Pitcher] at baseballreference.com&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Boog Powell]], the 1970 American League MVP, hit a meager .178/.211/.278 against [[Mickey Lolich]] over 96 plate appearances and would be substituted, possibly with a hitter like [[Chico Salmon]], who hit a much more acceptable .300/.349/.400 against the same pitcher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/b-pvb.cgi?n1=powelbo01#minPA2=50&amp;minPA=50&amp;n1=powelbo01&amp;as=batter&amp;year_game=career&amp;orderby=Name Boog Powell Batting vs. Pitcher] at baseballreference.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/pi/b-pvb.cgi?n1=salmoch01#minPA2=43&amp;minPA=43&amp;n1=salmoch01&amp;as=batter&amp;year_game=career&amp;orderby=Name Chico Salmon Batting vs Pitcher] at baseballreference.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of the bench===
Weaver made expert use of the bench. In the Oriole teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s, Weaver made frequent use of [[platoon system|platoons]], with the most obvious example being the use of [[Gary Roenicke]] and [[John Lowenstein]] in left field, absent affordable full-time solutions. Weaver also exploited a loophole in the [[designated hitter]] rule by listing the starting pitcher as the DH. This gave him another opportunity to exploit pitcher-batter matchups, in the case that the opposing starting pitcher left the game early because of injury or ineffectiveness before it was the DH's turn in the batting order. A rule was created to stop the use of this tactic, allegedly (by Weaver) because it was distorting pinch-hitting statistics.{{Fact|date=June 2011}}

Weaver pioneered the use of radar guns to track the velocity of pitches during the 1972 spring training season.{{Fact|date=June 2011}}

Between his stints as manager Weaver served as a [[color commentator]] for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television, calling the [[1983 World Series]] (which included the Orioles) along with [[Al Michaels]] and [[Howard Cosell]]. Weaver was the #1 [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] analyst in [[1983 in baseball|1983]], but was also employed by the Baltimore Orioles as a consultant. At the time, ABC had a policy preventing an announcer who was employed by a team from working games involving that team. So whenever the Orioles were on the primary ABC game, Weaver worked the backup game. This policy forced Weaver to resign from the Orioles consulting position in October in order to be able to work the World Series for ABC. Weaver later called the [[1984 National League Championship Series]] for ABC alongside [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Reggie Jackson]].

===''Manager's Corner''===
{{unsourced section|date=June 2011}}
While managing the Orioles, Weaver hosted a radio show called &quot;Manager's Corner&quot;, in which he would give his views on baseball and answer questions from fans. Weaver once recorded a prank version of the program, giving hilarious off-color answers to queries ranging from [[Terry Crowley]], &quot;team speed&quot; and even growing tomatoes (one of Earl's hobbies was gardening). The tape, which was not broadcast at the time, has since become legendary in Baltimore sports circles and has even been aired (in heavily edited fashion) on local sports radio. (A short film by Skizz Cyzyk featuring the full unedited version can be found. Since 2004, its been regularly aired, uncensored, on SiriusXM Satellite Radio's '[[Opie &amp; Anthony]]' Show.

==In media==
In [[1987 in video gaming|1987]], Weaver assisted in the development of the [[artificial intelligence|AI]] for the [[computer game]] ''[[Earl Weaver Baseball]]'', which was published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was one of the precursors of the [[EA Sports]] line.{{Fact|date=June 2011}}

He also wrote three books: ''Weaver on Strategy'' (1984), ''It's What You Learn After You Know It All That Counts'' (1983), and ''Winning'' (1972).{{Fact|date=June 2011}}
