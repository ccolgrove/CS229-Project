Dakota High School is a public high school located in [[Macomb Township, Michigan|Macomb]], Michigan, United States. It opened in 1995 as the second high school in the Chippewa Valley school district. An overflow of freshmen caused the need to build a ninth grade center. However, as that building could not be built in time for the 2007-2008 school year, Dakota had to utilize a finished wing of the new Seneca Middle School building. The Ninth Grade Center has been open and in use since the 2008-2009 school year. This school is full of nasty hos.
