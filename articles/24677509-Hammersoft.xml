== Coaching career ==
Turner Thorne began her coaching career at [[Northern Arizona University]], winning consecutive seasons in 1994-95 and 1995â96, the first time the school had accomplished this. She then transferred to the Arizona State University Sun Devils team for the start of the 1996 season, where she has led the Arizona State women's [[basketball]] team to the [[NCAA]] Tournament seven times. This achievement is four more than in the 15 years prior to her arrival as coach.

In the 2004-05 season, the Sun Devils under Turner Thorne gained a 24-10 overall record and its first NCAA [[Sweet Sixteen (NCAA Basketball Tournament)|Sweet Sixteen]] appearance in 22 years.  The team also gained a record of 25-9, which met the single-season school record for most wins at that time.  ASU shared the [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]] title in 2001 and the inaugural [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]] Tournament title in 2002, the first league championships the school had achieved.

In the 2006-07 season, the Sun Devils achieved 31 wins, including a school record 16 [[Pacific-10 Conference|Pac-10]] wins, which brought them to the [[Elite Eight]] of the NCAA Tournament for the first time.  At the end of the 2006-07 season, the Sun Devils ranked No. 8 in the final USA Today/ESPN coaches poll and No. 10 in the final Associated Press poll, the highest final rankings in each poll the school had achieved.  In the summer of 2007 Turner Thorne served as an assistant coach on USA Basketball's U-21 World Championship Team which won the gold medal at the U-21 [[FIBA World Championship]] in Moscow, Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/asu-w-baskbl-body.html|title=Arizona State University Athletics Official Website|publisher=ASU Athletics|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Sun Devils rejoined the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament for the second time in three seasons under Turner Thorne's leadership.  Having achieved 26 wins in the 2008-09 season, Turner Thorne became one of three Pac-10 coaches alongside [[University of Washington]] head coach [[Chris Gobrecht]] and [[Stanford University]] head coach [[Tara VanDerveer]] to have led their respective schools to five or more consecutive 20-win seasons. 

During the summer of 2009, Turner Thorne served as the head coach of the USA Women's World University Games Team which won the gold medal at the 2009 World University Games in [[Belgrade]], Serbia, having won all seven of their games. It was Turner Thorne's second time working with [[USA Basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usabasketball.com/women_team.php?page=wwug|title=USA Basketball|publisher=USA Basketball|accessdate=2009-10-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/asu-w-baskbl-body.html|title=Arizona State University Athletics Official Website|publisher=ASU Athletics|accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
