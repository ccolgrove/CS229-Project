After the season, Bullitt received recognition from ''[[USA Today]]'', which listed him on its annual [[USA Today All-Joe Team|&quot;All-Joe&quot; team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2009-01-20-all-joe-team_N.htm|title=Annual All-Joe team: Honoring those who won little acclaim | work=USA Today | first=Larry | last=Weisman | date=January 22, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his then-new role as a starter, Bullitt stated: &quot;You always want to be a starter. Thatâs why you come to the NFL. You donât want to come in and be a backup. You have to learn and you have to wait your time. You have to be patient, because anytime, an opportunity may come. Mine came this year, and I just wanted to go out and do the best I can and show people in the league I can play, too.&quot;&lt;ref name=11-24-08TribStar/&gt;

===2009 season===
In January 2009, Bullitt was named the &quot;emerging star&quot; of the [[AFC South]] by an [[ESPN.com]] blogger; seven other players representing each division of the league were named one as well. The players were picked based on their performances in the 2008 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=predictions09/nfl|title=Flacco, Ravens should soar to new heights in 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His teammates elected him as one of the two 2009 special teams captains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.colts.com/sub.cfm?page=article7&amp;news_id=a7a1c255-d0e4-450d-8b3b-7ba59ba4c53f|title= COLTS NAME FOUR CAPTAINS F0R 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He started the season as a starter replacing the injured Bob Sanders. 
He was named the &quot;Unsung Hero of the Week&quot; for Week 3 by ''USA Today'' for his performance against the Arizona Cardinals. Bullitt forced a fumble and also prevented an airborne player from scoring a touchdown at the goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2009-09-28-nfl-replay_N.htm|title=NFL Replay: Declining skills at the root of T.O.'s slow start | work=USA Today | first=Jarrett | last=Bell | date=September 30, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullitt also made a crucial fourth down stop in the 35â34 victory over the New England Patriots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sentinelsource.com/articles/2009/11/16/sports/national/free/id_379416.txt|title=They did what!?: Patriotsâ fourth-down gamble backfires big time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.indystar.com/philb/2009/11/the_bullitt_shot_heard_around.html|title='The Bullitt Shot' heard around the NFL world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the second straight year, Bullitt made [[USA Today]]'s [[USA Today All-Joe Team|&quot;All-Joe&quot; team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2010-01-26-all-joe-team_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Joe Flacco an overachieving headliner on '09 All-Joe Team | first=Nate | last=Davis | date=January 28, 2010 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010â2011 seasons===
In October 2010, Bullitt was placed on injured reserve and missed the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/10/05/colts-safety-melvin-bullitt-will-miss-the-rest-of-the-season/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
He wears the No. 33 in honor of his father, Jerry Bullitt, who wore the number as a linebacker at Texas A&amp;M. When asked about his number, Bullitt stated: &quot;I kind of feel like when I'm wearing (No. 33), a piece of my dad is with me when I'm on the field.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080518/SPORTS03/805180377/1004/SPORTS Rhodes caught in a numbers game, and it might get costly IndyStar.com | The Indianapolis Star]&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow teammate [[Dominic Rhodes]] previously wore the same number for six seasons from 2001â2006 before playing the 2007 season for the [[Oakland Raiders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribstar.com/colts/local_story_211223912.html|title=Dominic Rhodes enjoys reunion with team he helped win Super Bowl XLI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Rhodes returned to the Colts prior to the 2008 season, he tried to get the number back and even offered Bullitt serious money for it, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nfl.fanhouse.com/2008/05/18/back-with-the-colts-dominic-rhodes-might-buy-no-33-from-melvin/|title=Back With the Colts, Dominic Rhodes Might Buy No. 33 From Melvin Bullitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
