'''Temple University''' is a comprehensive [[public university|public research university]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, United States. Originally founded in 1884 by Dr. [[Russell Conwell]], Temple University is among the nation's largest providers of professional education ([[law]], [[medicine]], [[podiatric medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], [[architecture]]) and prepares the largest body of professional practitioners in Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.temple.edu/about/mission.htm|title=Temple Mission|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  offering over 300 academic degree programs at seven campuses and sites in [[Pennsylvania]] and its international campuses in [[Rome]], [[Tokyo]], and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.temple.edu/about/index.htm|title=About Temple|accessdate=2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 26th largest university in the United States with more than 37,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.&lt;ref name=student_profile&gt;http://www.temple.edu/ir/factbook/documents/2010_Fall_Student_Profile-Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple is one of Pennsylvania's state-related universities, meaning that it receives state funds but is independently operated. It shares this status with the [[Pennsylvania State University]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govt.psu.edu/Moving_The_Commonwealth_Foward.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beginnings===
Temple University was founded in 1884 by Dr. Russell Conwell, a [[Yale]]-educated [[Boston]] lawyer, orator, and ordained [[Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], who had served in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Conwell came to Pennsylvania in 1882 to lead the Grace Baptist Church while he began tutoring working class citizens late at night to accommodate their work schedules. These students, later dubbed &quot;night owls,&quot; were taught in the basement of Conwell's Baptist Temple, hence where the university receives its name. The Grace Baptist Church quickly grew popular within the North Philadelphia area. A temporary board of trustees was created to handle the rapidly growing formalities associated with the church's programs. When the board conducted its first meeting they named Russell H. Conwell president of âThe
Temple College.â Within the coming months, Grace Baptist Church appointed a new board of trustees, printed official
admissions files, and issued stock to raise funds for new teaching facilities. Regardless of whether they had the resources to
support the school, Conwellâs desire was âto give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual
channelsâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://www.usca.edu/essays/vol152005/lovik.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Billings granted a charter in 1888 to establish âThe Temple College of Billingsâ, but the city refused
to grant authority to award academic degrees. By 1888, the enrollment of the college was nearly 600. It was in 1907 that Temple College revised its institutional status and incorporated as a university. Legal recognition as a university enhanced Temple in noticeable ways including its reputation, professional and graduate programs, overall enrollment, and financial support.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

Over time, Temple expanded: Samaritan Hospital was founded, a Medical School was added, and Temple merged with the Billings Dental College.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; After the merger, Temple officially reincorporated as Temple University on December 12, 1907.

The [[Temple University Ambler]] (TUA) campus was originally a [[junior college]]. The Temple University Ambler Campus whose name was changed during the summer of 2009 to the School of Environmental Design, due to the campus' degree focus on Community and Regional Planning, Landscape Architecture, and Horticulture, and its specialization in environmental sustainability, now has 325 faculty and 4,600 students, offering bachelor's and master's degree programs on a 187 acre (757,000 mÂ²) [[arboretum]], located {{convert|13|mi|km}} from the main campus.

'''Temple University Harrisburg''' (TUH)&lt;!--text removed due to copyright violation of http://www.temple.edu/harrisburg/--&gt;

The '''Temple University Fort Washington''' (TUFW) campus opened in August 1997 in the Fort Washington Office Park as a graduate and professional education center and satellite location of Temple University Ambler. The campus offers graduate degrees in business, computer engineering, education, pharmacy and liberal arts. Temple University Fort Washington was designed to serve adult professional graduate students and the educational needs of businesses in the area. Templeâs graduate programs in Business (MBA); Educational Administration (EdM); and Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs (QA/RA), formerly housed at Temple University Ambler, were moved to the Fort Washington location. As a result, new and improved classroom space and computer resources became available to students at this new site.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Former campuses===
The [[Tyler School of Art]] campus, located in [[Elkins Park, Pennsylvania]], was donated by Stella Elkins Tyler in the 1930s to dedicate as an art school. That campus was closed and the school relocated to the main campus in the spring semester of 2009.

===Campus safety===
The Temple University Police department currently has 124 campus police officers, including supervisors and detectives.&lt;ref name=&quot;css.ocis.temple.edu&quot;&gt;http://css.ocis.temple.edu/about_us/CampusSafety.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Each officer is a Pennsylvania-certified law enforcement officer, who receive state-mandated police recruit training at an accredited state police academy

===Temple University Japan===

{{Nihongo|[[Temple University Japan]]|ãã³ãã«å¤§å­¦ã¸ã£ãã³ã­ã£ã³ãã¹|}}, is a branch campus located in [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato-ku]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Temple University Japan is the oldest and largest campus of any foreign university in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.com/article/Temple-U-Stands-Tall-in-Japan/66029/&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated 1,286 matriculated students, of which approximately one-half are Japanese, and one-half are either from the United States or more than 60 other countries.{{as of?|date=March 2011}} Of this number, 851 are undergraduates, and 435 are in graduate programs (48 MBA, 154 Law and 233 TESOL).{{as of?|date=March 2011}} ''Non-degree'' enrollment is about 978, and there are approximately 987 enrollments in continuing education programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tuj.ac.jp/about/pdf/factsheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{as of?|date=March 2011}}

The campus offers nine B.A., M.S.Ed., Ed.D., MBA and LL.M programs, as well as semester and year-long study abroad programs for U.S. undergraduates and law students (the latter is the first [[American Bar Association]]-accredited study abroad program in Asia). In addition, Temple University Japan has non-degree English-language, continuing adult education, and corporate education programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.com/article/Temple-U-Stands-Tall-in-Japan/66029/&lt;/ref&gt; 

After extended negotiations involving the U.S. and Japanese governments, Temple University Japan became the first recognized foreign university campus in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://chronicle.com/article/Temple-U-Stands-Tall-in-Japan/66029/&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, its credits and degrees are recognized as being equivalent to those of Japanese universities and can sponsor visas for international students. Students are also given Japanese student identification cards and can obtain student discounts on train passes, mobile phone contracts, and other items. The one remaining issue of contention between Temple University and the Japanese government is that the campus is taxed as a for-profit company, even though the main campus is a non-profit, state university. This puts a significant financial burden on Temple University Japan and its students.{{or|date=March 2011}}

[[Image:TempleOwlsAlternate.png|200px|right|thumb|The Temple Owl]]
{{Main|Temple Owls}}
Temple University's sports teams are the [[Owl]]s: a name born from Temple's early days when it was a night school. The sports teams all participate in the [[NCAA]]'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] and are primary members of the [[Atlantic Ten Conference]] (A-10), with the notable exception of football, which transitioned into the [[Mid-American Conference]] from being a I-A Independent. The Owls are also part of the [[Philadelphia Big 5]], the Philadelphia-area basketball rivalry. Temple University was among the first institutions in the United States to sponsor extracurricular athletic activities for its students when both the football and basketball programs were inaugurated in 1894 under the direction of Coach Charles M. Williams.

===Men's basketball===
{{Main|Temple Owls men's basketball}}
The Temple Men's basketball program is ranked 6th in All-Time NCAA wins with 1711, starting the 2009/2010 season.  Only Kentucky, North Carolina, Kansas, Duke, and Syracuse have a higher total.

Temple is recognized as having won the first-ever National Collegiate basketball championship in 1938, under Coach James Usilton. That Owls team, which finished with a 23-2 record, won the inaugural [[National Invitation Tournament]] by routing Colorado 60-36 in the championship final.  Because the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] was not held until the following year, Temple's NIT championship earned the Owls the first national college basketball title. During the 1950s, the Temple basketball team made two NCAA [[Final Four]] appearances (1956, 1958) under legendary Head Coach Harry Litwack. Litwack would be inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] after concluding a 21-year coaching career that included 373 wins.

Head Coach [[John Chaney (basketball coach)|John Chaney]], who is also a Hall of Fame coach, won a total of 724 career games and took Temple to the NCAA tournament 17 times. His 1987-88 Owls team entered the NCAA tournament ranked #1 in the country, and he has reached the [[Elite Eight]] on five different occasions. He was consensus national coach of the year in 1988. 

On April 10, 2006, [[University of Pennsylvania]] head coach and [[La Salle University]] alumnus [[Fran Dunphy]] was named the new Temple's Men's Head Basketball coach after Chaney's retirement in conclusion of the 2006 season. Dunphy had coached the Quakers for 17 straight seasons prior to the move. Dunphy and the Owls won the Atlantic-10 tournament in 2008 and won a spot in the NCAA Men's Basketball bracket. In 2009, the Owls won their second consecutive Atlantic-10 tournament, for their conference leading 8th A-10 title.

==Student life==
Resident students, totaling approximately 12,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;students_living&quot; /&gt; live mainly in the high-rise residential halls and apartment-style residences on the Main Campus in [[North Philadelphia]].  However, students also live on the Ambler campus. A few of Temple's oldest residence halls feature single-sex floors while most newer residence halls are co-ed, with single gender bathrooms. Additionally, wellness floors have been developed to allow students who select to live there an environment for healthy living. In 2005 the Office of University Housing and Residential Life opened its technology supported &quot;Jack Niven honors classroom&quot; within 1300 North and South Residence Hall to assist students.

The Independence Blue Cross Student Recreation Center, known as the IBC by students, provides 59,000 square feet (5,500 mÂ²) of fitness facilities. The Recreation Center is just one component of the Liacouras Center, the home court of the successful Temple basketball and various entertainment venues. In addition, the Student Pavilion, a multi-purpose, 4-court field house provides students with additional recreational space for volleyball, basketball, badminton, floor hockey, indoor soccer, tennis, golf, and much more.

More than 240 clubs and organizations provide outlets for all cultures and allow for socializing. Temple has a competitive political debate (where Temple is a member of the [[National Parliamentary Debate Association]]), community service, and more. Student-athletes compete in intercollegiate and intramural athletics.

In the Fall 2005, the University opened the Student Center Annex which included a full scale movie theater, underground multi-purpose room, game room, and computer lounge, as well as an improved meeting and office space for student groups and organizations.

==Residential halls and facilities==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}
Freshman and Sophomore students have the opportunity to live in several on-campus housing units: Johnson and Hardwick Residence Halls, Gertrude Peabody Residence Hall, James S. White Residence Hall, 1940 Residence Hall, 1300 Residence Hall, Temple Towers Residence Hall, and The Edge at Avenue North.

Extensive renovations have been made to the existing Temple University dormitories to keep up with modern expectations. Since 2006, both Johnson and Hardwick Residential Halls received complete renovations of their bathrooms and also received complete room restorations. The Temple Towers Residential Hall saw the long awaited refurbishment of their student apartments with an addition of individual common areas and balconies to add more space to the student units. The final Johnson and Hardwick restorations were completed in 2010 with the final renovation of a lobby with new entry points, security stations, office space, and lounge space. Pending commonwealth budget funding, the Peabody Residential Hall is to receive upgrades to their common bathrooms in the near future.

As part of the Temple 20/20 plan, the university has plans to build a new 1700 bed three-building student mixed use residential, retail and cafeteria complex on the corner of Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue to open in the Fall 2011. This would be the first university run building since the completion of 1300 Residence Hall in 2001. The building will sit on the former site of the University Services Building which was demolished in January 2010. The current University Service offices moved to a building off the Main Campus site.

===Johnson and Hardwick Halls===
The Johnson and Hardwick Residence Halls are 11-floor high rise facilities that are used as the traditional residence halls on the Main Campus. The buildings house around 1,000 Temple students every year. The Louis J. Esposito Dining Center is located on the ground level of the Johnson and Hardwick Halls near the north end of Main Campus. The cafeteria is commonly referred to as ''J&amp;H'' after the residence halls. The Esposito Dining Center is just one of two major cafeterias on campus.

===Peabody Hall===
The Gertrude Peabody Residence Hall is another traditionally styled dormitory on the Main Campus. In 2006, the building celebrated its 50th anniversary. Peabody Hall was originally designed as a women's residence hall with a campus cafeteria in the basement. The residence hall building structure has since undergone many renovations to better serve modern students including a study/ conference room lounge, game room, fitness center, computer lab, kitchen, and new windows and air conditioning.  The Gertrude Peabody Residence Hall is also known to have been built on land that once occupied one of Russell Conwell's, Temple University's founder, original homes.

===Graduate housing===
Temple University graduate students may obtain housing in the Triangle Apartments on Main Campus. While the Triangle Apartment complex is the oldest of the Main Campus residential halls, the Gertrude Peabody Residence Hall is the oldest traditionally designed residential hall.

===Auxiliary housing===
To accommodate the growing demand for on campus housing in recent years, the university has made arrangements for auxiliary housing for students that include Presidential City Apartments, Elmira Jefferies, Sydenham Commons, Oxford Village, The Edge at Avenue North, [[American Campus Communities]]' University Village, and Kardon-Atlantic Apartments. These apartment building complexes are strictly leased to Temple students only.

The Temple Main Campus is surrounded by an array of students living within independently run, local realty housing. After freshman and sophomore years, Temple students are not guaranteed housing. Many students who do not live in these buildings live in the immediate Philadelphia area.

==Temple developments==
===Technology===
In January 2006, the university opened the [[Temple TECH Center|TECH Center]]. The TECH Center is a {{convert|75000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} state-of-the-art technology facility with resources that cater to current learning styles. Designed with a variety of work spaces to enable students to work collaboratively or individually, the Tech Center is the largest of its kind in the nation. Temple also utilizes computer and distance learning equipped classrooms that are available throughout the various campuses. 85% of Temple's campus has wireless access. In 2004, the [[Princeton Review]] named Temple the fourth-most &quot;connected campus&quot; in the [[United States]] in the annual &quot;Top 25 Most Connected Campuses&quot; survey [http://www.forbes.com]. Temple has maintained its &quot;Top 25&quot; listing for three years in a row.  Many professors at Temple use &quot;Blackboard&quot; -- an online learning and scheduling system that electronically posts important class information such as homework, class cancellations, and announcements. Faculty and students can receive technology assistance at Temple's Instructional Support Center. In 2003, Fox School of Business began TUCAPTURE, an automated recording &amp; web casting system for classroom meetings. In 2006, PC Magazine named Temple as the 15th Most Wired College in America, quoting CEO Tim O' Rourke about TUCAPTURE, attendance, and note taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chang |first=Stephanie |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2075047,00.asp |title=#15 Temple University - Top 20 Wired Colleges |publisher=PCMag.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, TUCAPTURE featured 40 classroom and mobile devices internationally and offers more than 900,000 minutes of classroom audio, visuals, video, and handwriting, delivered automatically via email, podcast, webcast, RSS, and Blackboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campustechnology.com/article.aspx?aid=45216 ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
One of Hartâs first directives as president of Temple University was to establish a Sustainability Task Force, composed of students, faculty and staff, to study best-practices in large, urban universities and recommend actions the university could take to create a sustainable campus culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/president/inauguration/address.html Office of the President&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As an outgrowth of the task forcesâ recommendations, the Office of Sustainability was established on July 1, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/newsroom/2008_2009/07/announcements/sustainability.htm Temple establishes Office of Sustainability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as a central resource focusing on four key areas: operations, academics, research, and outreach &amp; engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/sustainability/wwd.htm Temple University, Office of Sustainability&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ambler campusâ âAmbler Collegeâ, which is home to the Community and Regional Planning, Landscape Architecture, and Horticulture Departments, has changed their name in 2009 to the School of Environmental Design, due to the campusâ focus on environmental sustainability.  The campus is also home to the Center for Sustainable Communities, a Sustainability based research center.

Thus far, the university has:
enacted policies that include purchasing from green vendors and conserving water and energy across campus;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/newsroom/2008_2009/12/announcements/conservation_policy.htm Key to conservation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
offered 46 undergraduate courses, 22 graduate courses and 12 General Education courses focusing on the environment and sustainability;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.temple.edu/sustainability/documents/SustainabilityCoursesUndergradGradGenEDFALL2008SPRING2009.xls&lt;/ref&gt; set in place programs to administer grants and offer incentives for any research related to the environment or sustainability;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/vpus/programs_initiatives/URIF.htm ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
offered programs to help create a green culture, both at Temple and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyw1060.com/pages/5290632.php KYW Newsradio 1060 Philadelphia - Local University Encourages Pedal Powered Transportation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/52334857.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/video?id=7016235 VIDEO: Temple recycling gets national attention | Video | 6abc.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/green/greenandsave/39663417.html Recycle Mania 101 | Philly | 02/15/2009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple 20/20===
Temple 20/20, a new framework to guide development at Templeâs main campus, will make Broad Street the center point of the university and include a new library for students and the community; a large new green space; a new science building and a high rise residence hall. Although the full plan has not been unveiled, highlights were recently reported by Philadelphia media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple 20/20&quot;&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/homepage/57975072.html Temple president's plan for the decade | Philadelphia Inquirer | 09/09/2009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The plan looks to expand Temple's structure of modernization exponentially, as well as improve the North Philadelphia community.

In accordance with the 20/20 plan, Temple wants to improve its most valuable piece of property, Broad Street. Improvements to Broad Street will likely include a new library, a signature building and more shopping and dining areas. Parking features will be expanded vertically with multi-level parking garages, instead of taking up valuable property space. Another sure renovation, is the transformation of the Baptist Temple into a {{convert|36000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} âtheater-in-the-round-styleâ concert hall, which will be home to Templeâs orchestra and choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 2, 2009 |url=http://temple-news.com/2009/09/02/2020-plan-sets-sights-around-campus/ |title=20/20 plan sets sights around campus |publisher=The Temple News |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the plan, the {{convert|105|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus will remain the same size, with buildings growing vertically or going in place of current buildings. To make the campus more open to the surrounding community, iron fencing will be removed from the boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple 20/20&quot;/&gt;
According to Temple University president, Ann Weaver Hart, the plan is designed to open up the campus; bring students out onto Broad Street and contribute to the development of North Philadelphia and the city itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple 20/20&quot;/&gt;

==Traditions and monuments==
=== The Temple &quot;T&quot; ===
[[Image:Temple T logo.svg|upright|thumb|Temple's &quot;T&quot; logo]]
The traditional symbol of the Temple University is the Temple &quot;T&quot;.  This modern symbol of the university was created through the work of Temple faculty and students. Early in his administration, President [[Peter J. Liacouras]] initiated a contest to choose a new symbol to represent the University.  The winner was this particular version of a representational &quot;T&quot;, which was created by Kristine Herrick at the Temple University Tyler School of Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temple.edu/newsroom/2007_2008/06/stories/templet.htm Temple âTâ turns 25&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol was adopted in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=March 25, 2008 |url=http://temple-news.com/2008/03/25/temple-community-relations-under-peter-liacouras/ |title=Temple community relations under Peter Liacouras |publisher=The Temple News |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Owl===
The [[owl]] is the [[symbol]] and [[mascot]] for Temple University and has been since its founding in 1888. Temple was the first school in the United States to adopt the owl as its symbol. The owl, a [[nocturnal]] hunter, was initially adopted as a symbol for Temple University because began as a night school for ambitious young people of limited means. Russell Conwell encouraged these students with the remark: &quot;The owl of the night makes the eagle of the day.&quot;

===Fight song===
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various Temple University events, such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic events, is the Temple University Fight Song.

[[File:Alumni Circle.jpg|thumb|right|Alumni Circle Owl]]

===The Bell Tower===
The Bell Tower Plaza is located in the center of the Main Campus between [[Paley Library]] and Beury Hall. The plaza is a popular student hangout and is the site of the Temple Bell Tower. The Bell Tower serves as a central meeting place for students and is often the location for official events such as Spring Fling, protests, promotions, speeches, political campaigning, and charity drives by student organizations. In warm weather, many students crowd onto the surrounding grass area, being the largest &quot;green space&quot; on the urban campus. [http://mdev.temple.edu/webcams/paleycam/ A live web cam stream of the plaza is available online.]

===Alumni Circle===
The Alumni Circle is located near the Founder's Garden on Liacouras Walk. The monument's structure is uniquely designed to reflect sound, most notably by reverberating a spoken voice. It was donated by a class and is a common stop for tours of campus and a popular site visited by alumni.

===Johnny Ring Garden===
Located off the faculty staff dining 'Diamond Club' this is a green area on campus commonly used for wedding photos and celebrates the history of Russell Conwell and Johnny Ring.

===Founders Garden===
The Founders Garden serves as the burial site for Dr. Russell Conwell. His legacy for the founding and for his 38-year presidency at Temple is celebrated in the garden. Conwell, a former Yale student, Civil War captain, Boston lawyer, and Philadelphia minister, utilized Temple as his vehicle to provide working class Philadelphians the opportunity for higher education. It has been estimated that by the time Conwell died at age 82 he was responsible for over 100,000 men and women pursuing higher education. Conwell used his income from his famous â[[Acres of Diamonds]]â speech to provide funding for Temple.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The garden is located directly behind the Alumni Circle, off of Liacouras Walk. A bust of Conwell was constructed in the garden marking the site of the burial.

==Historical==
On April 2, 1965, [[Lester B. Pearson]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and recipient of the [[Nobel peace prize]] was awarded the Temple University World Peace Prize.  During his acceptance speech Pearson criticised American bombing of [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]],

''&quot;There are many factors which I am not in a position to weigh.  But there does appear to be at least a possibility that a suspension of such air strikes against North Vietnam, at the right time, might provide the Hanoi [communists] authorities with an opportunity, if they wish to take it, to inject some flexibility into their policy without appearing to do so as the direct result of military pressure&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;Stursburg, Peter, &quot;Lester Pearson and the American Dilemma&quot;, ''Vietnam War: The Speech'', Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc, 1980, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

The seemingly harmless speech infuriated former President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] who, the next day at [[Camp David]], took Pearson out onto the terrace and began &quot;laying into [Pearson] in no uncertain fashion&quot;. Pearson later apologized for the speech.&lt;ref&gt;Stursburg, Peter, &quot;Lester Pearson and the American Dilemma&quot;, ''Vietnam War: The Speech'', Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc, 1980, p.218&lt;/ref&gt;
