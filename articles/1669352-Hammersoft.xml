'''''Diamonds and Pearls''''' is the thirteenth [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], released October 1, 1991, on [[Paisley Park Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]]. It is his first album to have [[The New Power Generation]], his backing band at the time, receive co-billing. The album produced several hit singles, including &quot;[[Gett Off]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cream (song)|Cream]]&quot;, &quot;[[Money Don't Matter 2 Night]]&quot;, &quot;[[Insatiable (Prince song)|Insatiable]]&quot;, and the [[Diamonds and Pearls (song)|title track]]. Dancers Lori Werner (then dancing under the stage name of Lori Elle) and [[Robia LaMorte]], known as &quot;Diamond&quot; and &quot;Pearl&quot; respectively, are featured on the [[Holography|holographic]] cover (re-pressings of the album are non-holographic). Diamond and Pearl also appeared in the [[music video]]s for &quot;Cream&quot;, &quot;Strollin'&quot;, &quot;Gett Off&quot;, and the title track, and also participated in Prince's ''Diamonds and Pearls'' tour.

''Diamonds and Pearls'' featured a hybrid of music styles, from the [[funk]] of &quot;Daddy Pop&quot;, &quot;Jughead&quot;, and first single &quot;Gett Off&quot;, to some of the more mainstream [[Pop music|pop]]/[[Rock music|rock]] songs Prince had recorded in some time, such as &quot;Cream&quot;, &quot;Money Don't Matter 2 Night&quot; and the title song. &quot;Willing and Able&quot; was used in a video montage during the closing credits of [[CBS Sports|CBS]] coverage of [[Super Bowl XXVI]].

==Album evolution==
One of the earliest songs that ended up on ''Diamonds and Pearls'' was &quot;Live 4 Love&quot;, a track from 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.housequake.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=45942 |title=Prince Songs List (Released &amp; unreleased) |publisher=housequake.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071025182510/http://www.housequake.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=45942 |archivedate={{date|2007-10-25}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bulk of the material would be composed in 1990, however.  A few songs evolved during Prince's [[Nude Tour]] in 1990, notably &quot;The Flow&quot;, and &quot;Schoolyard&quot;.  Prince decided to place an emphasis on [[Rap music|rap]] with this album, handing the reins over to Nude Tour dancer, [[Tony M.]]  An early version of the album from November 1990 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://prince.org/msg/7/116565 |title=The Prince Alternate &amp; W.I.P. Albums List '79 - 2001 |publisher=prince.org |accessdate={{date|2011-09-15}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisted of the following:

# &quot;Daddy Pop&quot;
# &quot;Walk Don't Walk&quot;
# &quot;Schoolyard&quot;
# &quot;Strollin'&quot;
# &quot;Willing and Able&quot;
# &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot;
# &quot;Insatiable&quot;
# &quot;Money Don't Matter 2 Night&quot;
# &quot;Horny Pony&quot;
# &quot;Live 4 Love&quot;
# &quot;Something Funky This House Comes&quot;
# &quot;Call the Law&quot;
# &quot;The Flow&quot;

Most of these songs went through minor to major revisions before being released, and five of them didn't make the cut at all. However, &quot;Call the Law&quot; would be released as the B-side to &quot;Money Don't Matter 2 Night&quot;, and later, on The New Power Generation album, ''[[Goldnigga]]'', while &quot;The Flow&quot; would be revised for the ''[[Love Symbol Album]]'' album. A later version of the album, closer to the actual release date was identical to the official album, but still had &quot;Horny Pony&quot; in the place of &quot;Gett Off&quot;, a newly written track which ended up replacing &quot;Horny Pony&quot; at the last minute. In fact, &quot;Horny Pony&quot; still exists on the track listing, written in red over &quot;Gett Off&quot;, and is mentioned in the lyrics to &quot;Push&quot;.
