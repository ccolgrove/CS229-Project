The '''PRR GG1''' is a class of [[electric locomotive]]s that was built for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] for use in the [[northeastern United States]]. A total of 140 GG1s were constructed by its designer [[General Electric]] and the Pennsylvania's [[Altoona Works]] from 1934 to 1943.

Initially introduced into service by the Pennsylvania in 1935, the GG1 was operated by its successor companies&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], [[Consolidated Rail Corporation|Conrail]] and [[Amtrak]]. The last GG1 was retired from service by [[New Jersey Transit]] in 1983. Most of the GG1s were scrapped, but several were preserved by various museums around the United States.

==Technical information==
A GG1-class locomotive is {{convert|79|ft|6|in}} long and weighs {{convert|475000|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASME 5&quot;&gt;&quot;Pennsylvania Railroad Electric Locomotive GG1 4800&quot;, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[locomotive frame|frame]] of the locomotive was formed from two bridge-like [[truss]]es joined together with [[ball and socket joint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pennsylvania Railroad Electric Locomotive GG1 4800&quot;, pp. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; The body rested on the frame and was clad in [[welding|welded]] steel plates. The two cabs are in the middle of the locomotive, situated for greater crew safety in the event of a collision.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASME 3&quot;&gt;&quot;Pennsylvania Railroad Electric Locomotive GG1 4800&quot;, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Pantograph (rail)|pantograph]] mounted on each end of the locomotive body was used to collect the 25&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]], 11,000&amp;nbsp;[[Volt|V]] [[alternating current]] (AC) from the [[overhead lines]]. [[Transformer]]s located between the two cabs stepped down the 11,000&amp;nbsp;V to the voltages needed for the [[traction motor]]s and other electrical equipment on the engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASME 3&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:Penn Central No 4801 4800.jpg|thumb|left|[[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] 4801 and 4800 hauling freight through [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] in December 1975.|alt=Two black electric locomotives pulling boxcars.]]

Twelve {{convert|385|hp|adj=on}} GEA-627-A1 traction motors drove the GG1's six {{convert|57|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter [[driving wheel]]s on three axles using a [[quill drive]]. Four unpowered [[leading wheel|leading]]/[[trailing wheel|trailing]] wheels were mounted on each end of the locomotive. Using [[Whyte notation]] for [[steam locomotive]]s, each frame is a [[4-6-0]] locomotive, which in the [[PRR locomotive classification|Pennsylvania Railroad classification system]] is a &quot;G&quot;. The GG1 is composed of two such frames mounted back to back, 4-6-0+0-6-4. The [[AAR wheel arrangement]] is 2-C+C-2 meaning two sets of three powered axles that are hinged together, with two unpowered axles on either side.

==History==
The mechanical design of the GG1 was based largely on the [[New Haven EP3]], which had been borrowed earlier from the [[New Haven Railroad]] by the Pennsylvania to compare it to its current standard electric locomotive, the [[PRR P5|P5a]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezilla 1980, pp. 141&amp;ndash;142.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the Pennsylvania decided the replace its P5a locomotives and instructed both General Electric and [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] to design a prototype locomotive with the following specifications: a lighter [[axle load]] and more power than the P5a, be capable of at least {{convert|100|mph|km/h}}, a streamlined body design and a central cab.&lt;ref&gt;Bezilla 1980, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both companies delivered their prototypes to the Pennsylvania in August 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 143&quot;&gt;Bezilla 1980, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; General Electric submitted the GG1 and Westinghouse submitted the [[PRR R1|R1]].  The R1 was essentially &quot;little more than an elongated and more powerful version of the P5a&quot; with an AAR wheel arrangement of 2-D-2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 143&quot;/&gt; Both locomotives were tested for ten weeks in regular service between New York and Philadelphia and on a test track in [[Claymont, Delaware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 145&quot;/&gt; Because the R1's rigid wheelbase prevented it from negotiating sharp curves and some [[railroad switch]]es, the Pennsylvania chose the GG1 and ordered 57 additional locomotives on November 10, 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 145&quot;/&gt; Of the 57, 14 were to be built entirely by [[General Electric]] in [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]] and 18 at the [[Altoona Works]]. The remaining locomotives were to be assembled in Altoona with electrical components from [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] in [[East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|East Pittsburgh]] and [[chassis]] from the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] in [[Eddystone, Pennsylvania|Eddystone]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;$15,000,000 order&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 28, 1935, to mark the completion of the electric line from [[Washington, D.C]] to [[New York City]], the Pennsylvania ran a special train pulled by [[PRR 4800]] before it opened the line for revenue service on February 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 154&quot;&gt;Bezilla 1980, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; It made a round trip from D.C. to [[Philadelphia]] and, on its return trip, set a speed record by arriving back in D.C. 1 hour and 50 minutes after its departure from Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 154&quot;/&gt;

A Pennsylvania GG-1 was used to pull the funeral train of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] from Washington D.C.'s [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] to New York City's [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Pennsylvania Station]] in [[1945]].&lt;ref&gt;FDR's Funeral Train by Robert Klara&lt;/ref&gt;

Styling of the prototype body shell is attributed to Westinghouse industrial designer Donald Roscoe Dohner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hampton C. Wayt |title=Donald Dohner: The man who designed 'RIVETS' |journal=Classic Trains Magazine ''(Summer 2009)''| pages= 30â35 |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing|Kalmbach]] |volume=10 |issue=2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hampton C. Wayt |title=Update on the GG1's genesis |journal=Classic Trains Magazine ''(Fall 2010)''| pages= 86â87 |publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing|Kalmbach]] |volume=11 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the Pennsylvania hired [[Raymond Loewy]] to &quot;enhance the GG1's aesthetics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 145&quot;&gt;Bezilla 1980, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Loewy recommended the use of a smooth, welded body instead of [[rivet]]ed one used in the prototype.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 146&quot;&gt;Bezilla 1980, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Loewy also added five gold [[pin striping|pinstripe]]s and a [[Brunswick green]] paint scheme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bezilla 146&quot;/&gt; The paint scheme was changed to [[Tuscan Red|Tuscan red]] in 1952 and the pinstripes were simplified to single stripe and large red [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s were added in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Schafer 2009, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Timetable speed limit for the GG1 was 80 mph until 1967-68 when it was raised to 100 mph for a year or two; when the Metroliner cars were being overhauled in the late 1970s GG1s were again allowed 100 mph when pulling Amfleet cars on trains scheduled to run 224.6 miles from New York to Washington in 3 hrs 20-25 minutes.

===Incidents===
On January 15, 1953, [[PRR 4876]] headed up Train 173, the ''[[Federal Express (passenger train)|Federal]]'', from [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] to Washington, D.C. The train passed a [[railway signal|signal]] {{convert|2.1|mi}} north of [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] traveling between {{convert|60|and|70|mph|km/h}} and the engineer decreased the throttle and started applying the brakes in preparation for entering the station.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Accident at Union Station&quot;, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; When the engineer realized that the train was not slowing down, and applying the [[emergency brake (train)|emergency brake]] had no effect, he proceeded to sound the engine's horn. A [[signalman (rail)|signalman]], on hearing the horn and noting the excessive speed of the 4876, phoned ahead to the [[station master]]'s office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Loftus 16&quot;&gt;Loftus 1953, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 4876 negotiated several [[Railroad switch|switches]] without derailing, at speeds well over the safe speed limits and entered the station at around {{convert|35|to|40|mph}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;accident 5&quot;&gt;&quot;Accident at Union Station&quot;, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The train rammed the [[buffer stop]]s, continued through the station master's office and into the [[concourse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;accident 5&quot;/&gt; The weight of 4876 caused it to fall through the floor and into the station's basement. A temporary floor was erected over the engine, and the hole it created, for the [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Loftus 16&quot;/&gt; 4876 was eventually dismantled and removed from the basement. It was reassembled in Altoona, before being put back into service.

[[File:CrashedGG1.jpg|thumb|left|PRR 4876 after the crash in Union Station.|alt=A locomotive with its pantograph raised, lying at angle and partially tipped over, with wreckage strewn about it.]]

The accident was determined to have been caused by an &quot;angle cock&quot;, a valve on the front and rear of a locomotive and rail cars used in the train's [[Railway air brake|airbraking]] system, on the rear of the third car in the train that had inadvertently closed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Accident at Union Station&quot;, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The handle of the angle cock had been improperly placed and had come into contact with the bottom of the car. Once it was closed, the brakes on all the cars behind the closed valve would not have been able to be applied.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Accident at Union Station, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The only major [[breakdown (vehicle)|breakdown]] of the GG1 was caused by a blizzard which swept across the northeastern United States in February 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Bezilla 1980, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The storm put nearly half of the GG1s out of commission. Exceptionally fine snow, caused by the extreme low temperatures, was able to pass through the locomotives' air filters and into the electrical components.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benjamin&quot;&gt;Benjamin 1958&lt;/ref&gt; The snow then melted and [[short circuit]]ed the components.&lt;ref name=&quot;Benjamin&quot;/&gt;

===Disposition===
When the Pennsylvania Railroad was merged with the [[New York Central Railroad]] in 1968, its fleet of GG1s was acquired by Penn Central. After its creation in 1971, [[Amtrak]] also inherited several GG1s. Amtrak intended to replace the GG1s in 1975 when it introduced the General Electric [[GE E60|E60]].&lt;ref&gt;Burks 1975, p. NJ23.&lt;/ref&gt; As the E60 never received clearance for speeds over {{convert|85|mph|km/h}}, Amtrak imported a small, lightweight engine from [[Sweden]] that became nicknamed the &quot;Swedish swifty&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burks 1980&quot;&gt;Burks 1980&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electro-Motive Diesel]], then a part of [[General Motors]], was licensed to build it in the United States and the &quot;Swedish swifty&quot; became the base of the [[EMD AEM-7|AEM-7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Burks 1980&quot;/&gt; With the AEM-7s on hand Amtrak was finally able to replace its GG1s. Penn Central went bankrupt in 1970 and its freight operations were assumed by the government-controlled Conrail. The last remaining GG1s in use were assigned to New Jersey Transit for its [[North Jersey Coast Line]] between New York and [[South Amboy, New Jersey|South Amboy]] and were, eventually, retired on October 29, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Soloman 2003, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 140 total GG1s built, 15 production locomotives and the prototype were preserved in museums:

== In popular culture ==
During the mid-1930s, the art of [[streamliner|streamlining]] became popular, especially with locomotives, as it conveyed a sense of speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schafer 127&quot;&gt;Schafer 2009, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; While other railroads were introducing streamlined trains, like the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]]'s [[M-10000]] or the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] with the ''[[Pioneer Zephyr|Zephyr]]'', the Pennsylvania had the GG1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schafer 127&quot;/&gt;  The GG1 has &quot;shown up over the years in more advertisements and movie clips than any other locomotive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ball 1986, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also featured in art calendars provided by the Pennsylvania, which were used to &quot;promote its reputation in the public eye.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cupper 1992, pp. 56&amp;ndash;57.&lt;/ref&gt; It has appeared in the films ''[[The Clock (film)|The Clock]]'' in 1945, ''[[Blast of Silence (film)|Blast of Silence]]'' in 1961, the 1962 version of ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', and ''[[Avalon (1990 film)|Avalon]]'' in 1990 in the [[livery]] of the Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clock'', 01:14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blast of Silence'', 01:30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchurian Candidate'', 41:56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Avalon'', 66:37.&lt;/ref&gt; Two GG1s appear in the 1973 film ''[[The Seven-Ups]]''&amp;mdash;a black Penn Central locomotive and a silver, red and blue Amtrak locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;''The Seven-Ups'', 93:33, 96:36.&lt;/ref&gt; A Penn Central GG1 also appears in another 1973 film ''[[The Last Detail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Last Detail'', 40:32.&lt;/ref&gt;  PRR GG1 4821 appears briefly in the 1952 film ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', pulling the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Train into Philadelphia's Greenwich Yard, with the movie's director Cecil B. DeMille narrating the scene of their arrival. Two Penn Central GG1s train pulled [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s [[funeral train]] on June 8, 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallas&quot;/&gt;

The GG1 and the ''[[Congressional (PRR train)|Congressional]]'' were featured on a [[postage stamp]] as part of the [[United States Postal Service]]'s [[All Aboard! 20th Century American Trains]] set in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;All Aboard!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
