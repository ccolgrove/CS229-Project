'''WordPad''' is a basic [[word processor]] that is included with almost all versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] from [[Windows 95]] upwards. It is more advanced than [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]] but simpler than [[Microsoft Works]] Word Processor and [[Microsoft Word]]. It replaced [[Microsoft Write]].

==Features==
WordPad can format and print text, but lacks intermediate features such as a [[spell checker]], [[thesaurus]], and support for tables. As such, it is suitable for writing letters or short pieces, but underpowered for work that relies heavily on graphics or typesetting.

WordPad natively supports the [[Rich Text Format]], though it does not support all the features defined in the RTF/Word 2007 specification. Previous versions of WordPad also supported the &quot;Word for Windows 6.0&quot; format, which is [[Forward compatibility|forward compatible]] with the Microsoft Word format{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}.

In Windows 95, 98 and Windows 2000, it used Microsoft's RichEdit control, versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 respectively. &lt;ref&gt; [http://blogs.msdn.com/murrays/archive/2010/01/13/richedit-versions-1-0-through-3-0.aspx RichEdit versions 1.0 through 3.0] &lt;/ref&gt; In Windows XP SP1 and later, it uses RichEdit 4.1,&lt;ref&gt; [http://blogs.msdn.com/murrays/archive/2006/10/14/richedit-versions.aspx RichEdit versions]&lt;/ref&gt; including Windows 7. &lt;ref&gt; [http://blogs.msdn.com/murrays/archive/2009/06/19/wordpad-numbering-limit.aspx WordPad Numbering Limit] &lt;/ref&gt;

WordPad for [[Windows XP]] added full Unicode support, enabling WordPad to support multiple languages, but [[UTF-16/UCS-2]] Big Endian is not supported. It can open [[Microsoft Word]] (versions 6.0-2003) files{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, although it opens newer versions of the .DOC format with incorrect formatting. Also, unlike previous WordPad versions, it cannot save files in the [[.doc]] format (only [[.txt]] or [[.rtf]]). Windows XP Service Pack 2 disabled support for opening &lt;tt&gt;[[.WRI]]&lt;/tt&gt; files for security purposes.

[[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] SP2 and [[Windows Vista]] include speech recognition, and therefore dictation into WordPad is possible. In these and later Windows versions, the RichEdit control was added and as a result, WordPad now supports extensible third-party services (such as grammar and spell check) built using the ''[[Text Services Framework]]'' (TSF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa371122.aspx Enabling Text Correction for Custom Ink Collectors]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Windows Vista]], support for reading Microsoft Word [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] files was removed because of the incorrect rendering and formatting problems, as well as a Microsoft security bulletin that reported a security vulnerability in opening Word files in WordPad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-010.mspx&lt;/ref&gt; For viewing older (97-2003) as well as newer ([[Office Open XML]]) documents, Microsoft recommends [[Microsoft Word Viewer|Word Viewer]], which is available for free. Native [[Office Open XML]] and [[OpenDocument|ODF]] support was released in the [[Windows 7]] version of WordPad.&lt;ref&gt;http://notes2self.net/archive/2008/10/29/openxml-and-odf-in-windows-7-wordpad.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft has updated the user interface for WordPad in Windows 7, giving it an [[Microsoft Office 2010|Office 2010]]-style [[ribbon (computing)|ribbon]] that replaces the application menu and toolbars. Other bundled Windows applications such as [[Paint (software)|Paint]] have had similar changes of interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uxevangelist.blogspot.com/2008/09/windows-7-m3-build-6780-new-wordpad-ui.html Windows 7 M3 Build 6780: The New WordPad UI!]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
WordPad was introduced in Windows 95, replacing [[Microsoft Write]], which came with all previous versions of Windows (version 3.1 and earlier). The source code to WordPad was also distributed by Microsoft as a [[Microsoft Foundation Class Library|Microsoft Foundation Classes]] sample application with MFC 3.2 and later, shortly before the release of Windows 95. It is still available for download from the [[MSDN]] [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/51y8h3tk(vs.71).aspx Web site].

The default font used in Windows 95 was Arial 10, in Windows 7 it was changed to Calibri 11.

A similar word processor called WordPad is supplied by some vendors on a [[Windows CE]] pre-installation. It has simple functionality like its desktop OS cousin. The icon resembles an early [[Microsoft Word]] icon.
