The strike occurred from April 1, 1972 to April 13, 1972.

==Overview==
===Agreement and number of games missed===
Baseball resumed when the owners and players agreed on a [[United States dollar|$]]500,000 increase in [[pension fund]] payments. Owners agreed to add salary [[arbitration]] to the Collective Bargaining Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/news/2002/05/25/work_stopppages/ CNNSI.com - Baseball - Baseball's Work Stoppages - Thursday August 08, 2002 05:00 AM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The 86 games that were missed over the 13-day period were never played because the league refused to pay the players for the time they were on strike. As a result, the [[Houston Astros]] and [[San Diego Padres]] each played only 153 games, nine fewer than normal. Most other teams lost anywhere from six to eight games.

===Major effects from the uneven schedule===
One major effect of the uneven schedule was that the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] played one more game than the [[1972 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]], and ended up winning the [[American League East|American League East Division]] by 1/2 game over the Red Sox. The Tigers won the division on the next-to-last day of the season when they beat Boston, 3-1, at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]].

For certain statistics (such as batting average and ERA), the minimum standards were based on the number of games played and had to be adjusted accordingly.
