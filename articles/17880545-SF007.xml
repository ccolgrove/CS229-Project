'''VMware View''' provides remote desktop capabilities to users using VMware's virtualization technology.  A client desktop operating system - typically Microsoft Windows 7, Vista or XP - are run within a virtual environment on a server.  The VMware View product has a number of components which are required to provide the virtual desktops, including:
* VMware vSphere for Desktops (includes ESX/ESXi virtualization)
* VMware vCenter Server (management of virtualization environment)
* View Composer (advanced View management, with automation and cloning)
* View Manager (administration of the View Environment) 
* View Client(communication between view and the desktop OS)

In order to transport a view of the desktop to users, keyboard, video, mouse and other interactions are sent over a LAN connection.  Protocols supported for this are both the Microsoft-developed RDP ([[Remote Desktop Protocol]]), along with the [[PCoIP]] protocol.  Access is also supported through any HTML5 compliant browser.&lt;ref&gt;

Specific embedded clients are also supported for a large number of thin clients, for a list of supported clients refer to the VMware website.&lt;ref&gt;
