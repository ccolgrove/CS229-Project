==Transportation==
West Chester is home to the [[West Chester Transportation Center]], which serves as a parking garage for the Chester County Justice Center and a [[Bus station|bus terminal]], which is located on the lower level of the facility.

The main east-west road to West Chester is [[West Chester Pike]], which begins in [[Upper Darby, Pennsylvania|Upper Darby]], [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] just outside of Philadelphia and is part of [[Pennsylvania Route 3|PA Route 3]].

The main north-south road in West Chester is High Street. To the north of town, the road is known as Pottstown Pike, which connects to [[Pennsylvania Route 100|PA Route 100]] in [[Exton, Pennsylvania|Exton]]. To the south of town, the road is known as Wilmington-West Chester Pike ([[U.S. Route 202 in Pennsylvania|US Route 202]] and [[U.S. Route 322|US Route 322]]).

Until September 1986, West Chester was served by [[SEPTA]]'s [[Media/Elwyn Line]] commuter rail line. Service on the line was discontinued due to poor track conditions west of the [[Elwyn (SEPTA station)|Elwyn]] station. At the time, SEPTA had limited funds for the necessary repairs, and offered Chester County the option of either improving the rail line or expanding parking availability at the nearby [[Exton (SEPTA station)|Exton]] station on SEPTA's [[Paoli/Thorndale Line]]. The county opted for the latter and service on the line was cut back to its current terminus of [[Elwyn, Pennsylvania|Elwyn]]. The rail line into West Chester is used by the [[West Chester Railroad]], a [[heritage railroad]].
