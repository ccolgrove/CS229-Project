'''VidaLinux''' is an [[operating system]] based on [[Gentoo Linux]]. Because Gentoo is notorious for its arduous installation process, VidaLinux uses the [[Red Hat]] [[Anaconda installer]] to make it easier for end users to install it. Its default [[desktop environment]] is GNOME. The purpose of '''VLOS''' (VidaLinux Desktop OS) is to make the Linux [[operating system]] more accessible to home and office users. Its goal is to combine the power of [[ebuild]]s and [[portage (software)|portage]] and compiling all software from [[source code|source]] (aside from a select few larger ones, which are available in binary) into an easy-to-use package. VidaLinux tries to provide most appropriate tools for home and office use, including:

* ALSA Support
* AMD 64-bit Support
* PPC support
* Anaconda Installer
* CD Player
* Epiphany
* Evolution
* Firefox 
* Gaim 
* GIMP
* Mozilla
* Mplayer
* OpenOffice.org suite
* PCMCIA Support
* RealPlayer 
* Reiser4 Support
* X-Chat
* X.Org
* Xine

==History==
As of December 3, 2009, VLOS has been rebuilt with [[Daniel Robbins]]' fork of Gentoo Linux called [[Funtoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=05804 |title=Development Release: VLOS 2.0 Alpha 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
Vidalinux comes in two different flavors; one can be downloaded, while the other must be purchased.  While the downloaded version technically has all the same software packages as the purchased version, the difference is that the purchased version (which can be bought for 25 [[USD]]) contains many binaries of often used programs, while the downloaded version forces the user to download ebuilds of these packages and build the binaries themselves, which requires more time.
