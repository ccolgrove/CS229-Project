'''Fanny Jackson Coppin''' (October 15, 1837 â January 21, 1913) was an [[African American]] educator and [[missionary]]. Born an American [[Slavery|slave]], Fanny Jackson's freedom was purchased by her aunt at age 12. Fanny Jackson spent the rest of her youth working as a [[servant]] for [[author]] [[George Henry Calvert]], studying at every opportunity. In 1860, she enrolled in [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio, the first [[college]] in the [[United States]] to accept both black and female students. During her years as a student at Oberlin College, she taught an evening course for free African Americans in reading and writing, and she graduated with a [[Bachelor's degree]] in 1865.

In 1865, Fanny Jackson accepted a position at [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia's]] '''Institute for Colored Youth''' (now [[Cheyney University of Pennsylvania]]). She served as the principal of the Ladies Department and taught [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Mathematics]]. In 1869, Fanny Jackson was appointed as the principal of the Institute after the departure of [[Ebenezer Bassett]], becoming the first African American woman to become a school principal.  In her 37 years at the Institute, Fanny Jackson was responsible for vast educational improvements in Philadelphia. During her years as principal, she was promoted by the board of education to superintendent. She was the first African American superintendent of a school district in the United States, but soon went back to the being a school principal. 

On December 21, 1881, Fanny married Reverend Levi Jenkins Coppin, a minister of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] pastor of Bethel AME Church Baltimore. Fanny Jackson Coppin started to become very involved with her husband's missionary work, and in 1902 the couple went to [[South Africa]] and performed a variety of missionary work, including the founding of the [[Bethel Institute]], a missionary school with self-help programs. 

After almost a decade of missionary work, Fanny Jackson Coppin's declining health forced her to return to Philadelphia, and she died on January 21, 1913. In 1926, a [[Baltimore]] teacher training school was named the '''Fanny Jackson Coppin Normal School''' (now [[Coppin State University]]).
