==Career==
===Professional wrestling===
Robinson initially embarked on a career in wrestling as 'Tiger Joe Robinson' and won the [[European Heavyweight Championship]] in 1952. At the same time, he was also interested in acting and studied at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]]. After injuring his back wrestling in [[Paris]] he decided to concentrate on acting.&lt;ref name=euro&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe has eye of the Tiger|work=The Visitor|url=http://www.thevisitor.co.uk/morecambe-news/Joe-has-eye-of-the.836535.jp|accessdate=2009-04-10|date=2004-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Joe Robinsons daughter Polly Robinson (Hardy-Stewart) has also continued the families success in martial arts by winning the junior Judo championships in the '80s.

===Acting===
Robinson's first role came in the keep-fit documentary ''[[Fit as a Fiddle]]'' and in the same year, 1952, he followed it up with a part as Harry 'Muscles' Green in the musical ''[[Wish You Were Here (musical)|Wish You Were Here]]'' in the West End of [[London]].

He made his film debut in 1955's ''[[A Kid for Two Farthings (film)|A Kid for Two Farthings]]'', in which he wrestled [[Primo Carnera]].  His film and television career really took off in the 1960s and in 1962 he appeared in British classic ''[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]'' alongside appearances in [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]] and [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]] in 1963.  With his younger brother Doug and [[Honor Blackman]], he co-authored [[Honor Blackman's Book of Self-Defence]] in 1965 (Joe was also a [[judo]] champion and black belt at [[karate]]). The year after he appeared in an episode of the sitcom ''[[Pardon the Expression]]'' which referenced this book. During this time he was also a popular stunt-arranger, working on several [[James Bond]] movies and in 1960 was invited to [[Rome]] where he appeared in five muscle-bound Italian epics, including &quot;THAUR THE MIGHTY&quot; (1963), &quot;THOR AND THE AMAZON QUEEN&quot; (1963) and &quot;URSUS AND THE TARTAR PRINCESS&quot; (1961).  Other notable big-screen appearances include 1961's ''[[Carry On Regardless]]'', of the British institution the [[Carry On films|Carry Ons]]. According to the book ''Tarzan of the Movies'' by [[Gabe Essoe]], Robinson played the role of [[Tarzan]] in obscure Italian-made films (''Taur, il re della forza bruta'' and ''Le gladiatrici''); the use of the Tarzan character, however, was unauthorized and the character's name had to be changed to Thaur before the film was allowed for public release. His final big-screen appearance in 1971's James Bond film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]''.  Robinson claimed that he was a contender for the [[Red Grant]] role in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.  Though he did not get it, Connery recommended him for the role in ''Diamonds are Forever''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevisitor.co.uk/morecambe-news/Joe-has-eye-of-the.836535.jp|title=Joe has eye of the Tiger|publisher=The Visitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
He is now retired and living in [[Brighton]] where he opened a martial arts centre.  In 1998 he hit the headlines after fighting off a gang of eight muggers single-handedly.  The 70 year old was getting off a bus in [[Cape Town]] when the gang struck with baseball bats and knives. 6&amp;nbsp;ft 2 ins Joe poleaxed two with flying kicks, (having been trained by Joe this is obviously Journalistic lecense. Joe would never advise kicking higher than the thigh in real combat and certainly not a flying kick - stuff of the movies!) karate-chopped another in the chest and broke the arm of a fourth, while the rest fled.

Reminiscing about his career in [[The Daily Mail]] recently, Robinson spoke on the subject of [[Laurence Olivier]]'s alleged homosexuality saying 'my kids used to play with his kids at school and I taught him judo ... I have no idea if he was a homosexual... but he did once tell me I had lovely shoulders.'
