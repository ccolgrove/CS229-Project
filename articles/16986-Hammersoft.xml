'''Kent State University''' (also known as '''Kent''', '''Kent State''', and '''KSU''') is a [[Public university|public]] research [[university]] located in [[Kent, Ohio]], [[United States]].  The university has eight campuses around the [[Greater Cleveland|northeast Ohio]] region with the main campus in Kent being the largest.  Other campuses are located in [[Ashtabula, Ohio|Ashtabula]], [[Burton, Ohio|Burton]], [[East Liverpool, Ohio|East Liverpool]], [[Jackson Township, Stark County, Ohio|Jackson Township]], [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]], [[Salem, Ohio|Salem]], and [[Warren, Ohio]].

As of September 2011, Kent State is one of the largest universities in Ohio with an enrollment of 42,185 students in the eight-campus system and 27,855 students at the main campus in Kent.&lt;ref name=fall10&gt;{{cite web |title= Fifteenth Day Enrollment Statistics|url= http://www.kent.edu/rpie/enrollment/index.cfm |date= September 2011|work= Kent.edu/RPIE |publisher= Kent State University |accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is ranked by the Carnegie Foundation as one of the top 77 public research universities in the US and one of the top 76 in community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Academics|url= http://www.kent.edu/academics/index.cfm|date= 19 August 2009|work= Kent.edu|publisher= Kent State University|accessdate=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Kent State was ranked as one of the top 200 universities in the world by ''[[Times Higher Education]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/top-200.html |title=World University Rankings 2010 |year=2010 |accessdate=February 14, 2011 |magazine=[[Times Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kent State offers over 300 degree programs, among them 250 [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]], 40 [[Associate's degree|associate's]], 50 [[Master's degree|master's]], and 23 [[Doctoral degree|doctoral]] programs of study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Graduation Planning System|url= http://www.kent.edu/gps/|date= 22 September 2009|work= Kent.edu|publisher= Kent State University|accessdate=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include such notable programs as nursing, [[liquid crystal]]s, business, history, [[library science]], aeronautics, journalism and fashion design.

The university was established in 1910 as the Kent Normal School as a teacher-training school.  The first classes were held in 1912 at various locations and in temporary buildings in Kent.  Since then, the university has grown to include several additional baccalaureate and graduate programs of study in the arts and sciences, research opportunities, as well as over {{convert|1000|acres|0|abbr=on}} and 119 buildings on the Kent campus.  During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the university was known internationally for its student activism in opposition to US involvement in the Vietnam war, due mainly to the [[Kent State shootings|massacre of May 4, 1970]].

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Kenthallbw.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Front of Kent Hall, built in 1915, one of the oldest buildings on campus.]]
What would become Kent State University was established in 1910 as an institution for training public school teachers.  It was part of the [[Lowry bill|Lowry Bill]] which also created a sister school in [[Bowling Green, Ohio]] â now known as [[Bowling Green State University]]. It was initially known under the working name of the '''[[Ohio State Normal College At Kent]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Johannesen |editor-first=Eric |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Ohio State Normal College At Kent| publisher=United States Department of the Interior|date=30 May 1975 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but was named '''Kent State Normal School''' in 1911 in honor of William S. Kent (son of [[Kent, Ohio]], namesake [[Marvin Kent]]), who donated the {{convert|53|acre|ha|0}} used for the original campus.  As such, it is the only public university in Ohio named for an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= F. Robert|last= Treichler|title= A History of Kent Hall|url= http://dept.kent.edu/psychology/documents/KentHallHistory.pdf|date= |work= Kent State Psychology Department website |publisher= Kent State University|accessdate=23 September 2009|page= 6|format= PDF|quote= Kent State is unique among Ohio's state-supported schools in being named for an individual.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Only Ohio public university named for an individual?|date=June 2011}}  The first president was [[John Edward McGilvrey]], who served from 1912 to 1926.&lt;ref name=mcgilvrey&gt;{{cite web |title= John Edward McGilvrey, Papers, 1890-1945|url= http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/faculty/mcgilvrey.html|date= 14 December 2005|work= Kent State University Special Collections and Archives|publisher= Kent State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGilvrey had an ambitious vision for the school as a large university, instructing architect [[George F. Hammond]], who designed the original campus buildings, to produce a master plan.&lt;ref&gt;Treichler, p. 1; ''&quot;President McGilvery, always a visionary, harbored the prospect that Kent would one day become a great university, and he instructed [[George F. Hammond|George Hammond]] to generate an architectural master plan to reflect that goal.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;  Classes began in 1912 before any buildings had been completed at the campus in Kent.  These classes were held at extension centers in 25 cities around the region.  By May 1913, classes were being held on the campus in Kent with the opening of Merrill Hall.&lt;ref name=memories1&gt;{{cite book |title=A Book of Memories |last=Hildebrand |first=William H. |coauthors=Dean H. Keller, Anita Dixon Herington |year=1993 |publisher=Kent State University Press |location= |isbn=0873384881 |pages= 18â20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school graduated 34 students in its first commencement on July 29, 1914.  In 1915, the school was renamed '''Kent State Normal College'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Special Collections FAQ |url= http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/scfaq.html#ksu |date= |work= Kent State University Special Collections and Archives FAQ |publisher= Kent State University|accessdate=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the addition of four-year degrees.  By then additional buildings had been added or were under construction.  Kent State's enrollment growth was particularly notable during its summer terms.  In 1924, the school's registration for summer classes was the largest of any teacher-training school in the United States.&lt;ref name=memories1/&gt;  In 1929, the state of Ohio changed the name to '''Kent State College''' as it allowed the school to establish a college of arts and sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The History of Kent|last= Grismer|first= Karl |year= 1932|publisher= Record Publishing (1932); Kent Historical Society (2001)|location= [[Kent, Ohio]]|page= 187|accessdate= 22 September 2009 |edition= 2001 Revision |unused_data= edition 2001 Revision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGilvrey's vision for Kent was not shared by many others outside the school, particularly at the state level and at other state schools.  His efforts to have the state funding formula changed created opposition, particularly from [[Ohio State University]] and its president [[William Oxley Thompson]].  This resulted in a 1923 &quot;credit war&quot; where Ohio State refused Kent transfer credits and spread to several other schools taking similar action. It was this development â along with several other factors â which led to the firing of McGilvrey in January 1926.&lt;ref name=memories1/&gt;  McGilvrey was succeeded first by David Allen Anderson (1926â1928) and James Ozro Engleman from 1928â1938, though he continued to be involved with the school for several years as president emeritus and as head of alumni relations from 1934-1945.&lt;ref name=mcgilvrey/&gt;  He was present in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] on May 17, 1935, when [[Kent, Ohio|Kent]] native Governor [[Martin L. Davey]] signed a bill that allowed Kent State and [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] to add schools of business administration and graduate programs, giving them each university status.&lt;ref name=memories1/&gt;

===1940s-1960s===
Beginning in 1944, the University was led by President George Bowman, who led until 1963.  During his tenure, the student senate, faculty senate and graduate council were organized.  Although it had served Stark County from the 1920s, in 1946, the University's first regional campus, the [[Kent State University Stark Campus|Stark Campus]], was established in [[Canton, Ohio]].  In the fall of 1947, Bowman appointed [[Oscar W. Ritchie]] as a full-time faculty member. Ritchie's appointment to the faculty made him the first [[African American]] to serve on the faculty at Kent State and also made him the first African American professor to serve on the faculty of any state university in Ohio. In 1977, the former Student Union, which had been built in 1949, was rededicated as Oscar Ritchie Hall in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Curtis T.|last= Clingman|title= Dr. Oscar W.

The 1950s and 1960s saw continued growth in both enrollment and in the physical size of the campus.  Several new dorms and academic buildings were built during this time, including the establishment of additional regional campuses in [[Warren, Ohio|Warren]] (1954), [[Kent State University Ashtabula Campus|Ashtabula]] (1957), [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]] (1962), [[Salem, Ohio|Salem]] (1962), [[Burton, Ohio|Burton]] (1964), and [[Kent State University East Liverpool Campus|East Liverpool]], [[Ohio]] (1965).&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Herrington, &amp; Keller; pp. 267-270&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, grounds superintendent Larry Wooddell and Biff Staples of the [[Davey Tree Expert Company]] released ten cages of [[black squirrel]]s obtained from [[Victoria Park, London (Ontario)|Victoria Park]] in [[London, Ontario]], [[Canada]], onto the Kent State campus.  By 1964 their estimated population was around 150 and today they have spread in and around Kent and have become unofficial mascots of both the city and university.  Since 1981, the annual Black Squirrel Festival is held every fall on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.victoria-park.com/ksu.htm|title= London Black Squirrels Take Over Kent State University|accessdate=23 September 2009 |work= Victoria-Park.com|publisher= Victoria-Park.com|year= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Herrington, &amp; Keller; p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, chemistry professor Glenn H. Brown established the [[Liquid Crystal Institute]],&lt;ref name=KHS&gt;{{cite book|title=Kent Ohio: The Dynamic Decades|coauthors=Kent Historical Society Book Committee|editor= Darrow, Ralph |year=1999|publisher=Kent Historical Society|location=[[Kent, Ohio]]|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; a world leader in the research and development the multibillion-dollar [[liquid crystal]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Johnson|first= Christopher |date= 1 August 2005|title= Liquid Crystal Institute blazes new trails at Kent State|journal= Inside Business|publisher=Great Lakes Publishing |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-160029070.html|accessdate=2009-09-23 |quote= ...the world's No. 1 liquid crystal research center is at Kent State University: the Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI).}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Fergasen invented and patented the basic liquid crystal in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Johnson|first= Christopher |date= 10 May 1999|title= Liquid Lessons: The Missed Opportunity of Liquid Crystal Technology isn't Lost on Researchers Striving to Establish a MEMS Industry Here|journal= Crain's Cleveland Business |publisher=Crain Communications|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54607677.html|accessdate=2009-09-23 |quote= in the 1970s, soon after Kent State University researcher James Fergason first invented the basic liquid crystal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ten liquid crystal companies have been spun off from the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Pettypiece|first= Shannon |date= 29 August 2005|title= Crystal clear; Kent State playing lead role in exploring medical, anti-bioterror uses for liquid crystal technology.|journal= Crain's Cleveland Business| publisher=Crain Communications|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-135711290.html|accessdate=2009-09-23 |quote= Since that time, the university has spun off 10 companies developing liquid crystal technology.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Kent State became the first university to run an independent, student-operated Campus Bus Service. It was unique in that it provided jobs for students, receiving funding from student fees rather than bus fares.  Campus Bus Service was the largest such operation in the country until it merged with the [[Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kent State University Campus Bus Service: History 1965-2004|url= http://www.partaonline.org/pdfs/CBShistory.pdf|year= 2004|work= PARTAonline.org|publisher= [[Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority|PARTA]]|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1969 saw the opening of a [[Dix Stadium|new Memorial Stadium]] on the far eastern edge of campus and the closure and dismantling of the [[Memorial Stadium (Kent)|old Memorial Stadium]].

===Kent State shootings===
{{main|Kent State shootings}}
Kent State gained international attention on May 4, 1970, when an [[Ohio Army National Guard]] unit fired at students during an anti-war protest on campus, killing four and wounding nine. The Guard had been called into Kent after several protests in and around campus had become violent, including a riot in downtown Kent and the burning of the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] building. The main cause of the protests was the United States' [[Cambodian Campaign|invasion of Cambodia]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Herrington, &amp; Keller; pp. 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;  The shootings caused an immediate closure of the campus with students and faculty given just 60&amp;nbsp;minutes to pack belongings.  Around the country, many college campuses canceled classes or closed for fear of similar violent protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kent State Shootings|url= http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1595&amp;nm=Kent-State-Shootings|date= 1 July 2005|work= Ohio History Central|publisher= Ohio Historical Society|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Kent, schools were closed and the National Guard restricted entry into the city limits, patrolling the area until May 8.  With the campus closed, faculty members came up with a variety of solutions â including holding classes in their homes, at public buildings and places, via telephone, or through the mail â to allow their students to complete the term, which was only a few weeks away at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Herrington, &amp; Keller; pp. 181-183&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971, the University established the Center for Peaceful Change, now known as the Center for Applied Conflict Management, as a &quot;living memorial&quot; to the students who had died.  It offers degree programs in Peace and Conflict Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Center for Applied Conflict Management|url= http://www.kent.edu/cacm/|date= 15 May 2008|work= Kent.edu |publisher= Kent State University|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Conflict Resolution and is one of the earliest such programs in the United States.

===1970s-1980s===
Also in 1970, the university opened its 12-story library, moving from the previous home of Rockwell Hall to the tallest building in [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michelle|last= Poje |title= PERC up: research papers aren't so bad with help from library |url= http://media.www.kentnewsnet.com/media/storage/paper867/news/2005/08/24/News/Perc-Up.Research.Papers.Arent.So.Bad.With.Help.From.Library-1517541.shtml|newspaper= Daily Kent Stater|publisher= KentNewsNet.com|date= 24 August 2005 |accessdate=23 September 2009|quote= With its 12 floors of resources and well-known status as the tallest building in Portage County...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dedicated in 1971, the library became a member of the [[Association of Research Libraries]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, Herrington, &amp; Keller; p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  Kent State joined with the [[University of Akron]] and [[Youngstown State University]] in establishing the [[Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy|Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine]] in 1973.  It was the world's first medical consortium.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it includes a college of [[pharmacy]] and [[Cleveland State University]] as an additional consortium member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= About NEOUCOM: Universities|url= http://www.neoucom.edu/audience/about/consortium/Universities|date= |work= NEOUCOM.edu |publisher= [[Northeastern Ohio Universities Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy]]|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kent State was again in the national spotlight in 1977 when construction was set to begin on the Memorial Gym Annex, adjacent to the area where the [[Kent State shootings]] had occurred in 1970. Protesters organized a [[Tent city#Kent State University|tent city]] in May, which lasted into July. Several attempts were made to block construction even after the end of the tent city, including an appeal to the [[United States Congress]] and the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] to have the area declared a [[National Historic Landmark]], which ended up being unsuccessful. Additional rallies were held that year, including one attended by [[Joan Baez]] on August 20.  After several additional unsuccessful legal challenges, construction finally began on September 19 and was finished in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Tent City Chronology (Gym Annex Controversy) |author= Slobodinski, Mikhail &amp; Schrager, Jennifer |url= http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/4May70/citychron.html|date= |work= Kent State University Special Collections and Archives |publisher= Kent State University|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s-Present===
In March 1991, Kent State once again made history by appointing [[Carol Cartwright]] as president of the University, the first female to hold such a position at any state university in Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Carol A.

==Campuses==
[[File:KSUGatewayArchNew.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Kent State Gateway Arch on Kent Campus]]
Kent State University is an eight-campus system in northeastern Ohio, with the main administrative center in [[Kent, Ohio|Kent]].  Within the Kent State University system, the main campus is officially referred to as the &quot;Kent Campus&quot;.&lt;ref name=regional&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kent.edu/Campuses/|title= Welcome to Kent State's Eight-Campus System |accessdate=2008-06-27 |work= Kent State University website|publisher= Kent State University|date= 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kent Campus is a landscaped [[suburban]] environment, covering approximately {{convert|866|acre|km2|1}} which house over 100 buildings, gardens, bike trails, and open greenery. There are also thousands of additional acres of bogs, marshes, and wildlife refuges adjacent to or near the campus.&lt;ref name=regional/&gt;  While the university's official mascot is Flash the [[Golden Eagle]], the campus also has an unofficial mascot in the [[Black Squirrel]], which were brought to Kent in 1961 and can be found on and around the campus. The campus is divided into North, South, and East sections but many areas have come to be referred to as Front Campus, Residential Campus, and Science Row. The main hub of activity and central point is the Student Center and Risman Plaza, which is adjacent to the twelve-story main library. The university also operates the 18-hole Kent State Golf Course and Centennial Research Park just east of campus in [[Franklin Township, Portage County, Ohio|Franklin Township]] and the {{convert|219|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} [[Kent State University Airport]] in [[Stow, Ohio|Stow]].

===Regional campuses===
[[File:Regionalksu.png|thumb|left|450px|Map of KSU campuses.]]
In addition to the Kent Campus, there are seven regional campuses. The system is one of the largest and oldest regional campus systems in the United States. The regional campuses provide a small, liberal-arts college feel as opposed to the large university feel of the Kent Campus.  Students at the regional campuses can begin any of Kent State's majors at their respective campus and each campus offers its own unique programs and opportunities that may or may not be available in Kent.  Regional campuses include:

====Ashtabula====
{{Main|Kent State University Ashtabula Campus}}
The Ashtabula Campus is made up of three buildings: Main Hall, a library, and a technology and art building. It is on a {{convert|125|acre|km2|adj=on}} site along the shores of [[Lake Erie]] in [[Ashtabula, Ohio]]. Kent State-Ashtabula is noted locally for its nursing program.
