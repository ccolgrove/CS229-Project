'''Bradley Lord''' (August 22, 1939 &amp;ndash; February 15, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]] who competed in men's singles.  He finished fourth at the [[1960 United States Figure Skating Championships]] and then placed sixth at that year's [[World Figure Skating Championships]] after the top three U.S. skaters skipped the event.  The following year, he won the gold medal at the [[1961 United States Figure Skating Championships]] and placed second at the 1961 [[North American Figure Skating Championships]].

Lord was en route to the World Championships in 1961 when his plane ([[Sabena Flight 548]]) crashed near [[Brussels, Belgium]], killing all on board.  

Lord trained with coach [[Montgomery Wilson]] at the [[Skating Club of Boston]].  
Away from the ice, Lord attended [[Boston University]] and wanted to pursue a career in commercial art.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Meet the Champions&quot;, ''Skating'' magazine, April 1961&lt;/ref&gt;
