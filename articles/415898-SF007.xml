'''Vuze''' (previously '''Azureus''') is a [[BitTorrent client]] used to transfer files via the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent protocol]]. Vuze is written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and uses the Azureus Engine. In addition to downloading data linked to by [[.torrent]] files, Azureus allows users to view, publish and share original [[DVD]] and [[High-definition video|HD]] quality video content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2006/12/72223 Azureus' HD Vids Trump YouTube], Calore, Michael (Wired News): (2006-12-04)&lt;/ref&gt; Content is presented through channels and categories containing TV shows, music videos, movies, video games and others. Additionally, if users prefer to publish their original content, they may earn money from it.

Azureus was first released in June 2003 at [[SourceForge.net]], mostly to experiment with the [[Standard Widget Toolkit]] from [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]. It later became one of the most popular BitTorrent clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/top/topalltime.php?type=downloads |title=SourceForge Top Projects |publisher=Sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Azureus software was released under the [[GNU General Public License]], and remains as a [[free software]] application. However, the Vuze software added in more recent versions is [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] and users are required to accept these more restrictive license terms in order to install current versions of the BitTorrent client. &lt;!--needs verification/maybe clarification in wording--&gt;

[[File:Vuze swarm animated.gif|right|thumb|Vuze/Azureus &quot;swarm view&quot; visualizes the incoming and outgoing torrent connections in real-time.]]
Azureus also supports the following cross-interface features:

* Specification of maximum upload and download speeds.
* Opening files within the program.
* [[Distributed hash table|DHT]] tracking for when a tracker is down or unavailable. (Distributed Database, a.k.a. &quot;Azureus DHT&quot;)

=== Interface ===
==== Main Azureus interface ====

Since version 3.0, Azureus starts with the main Vuze interface, designed to promote Vuze content. Here, you can browse media on the Vuze Network, share torrents with friends, and chat. Everything from the classic UI is still available, although hidden, under the vuze interface (see below). Vuze requires a registered account to gain access to certain content on the Vuze Network.

==== Classic interface ====
[[Image:AzureusSwarm.png|left|thumb|Vuze swarm feature (shown in Classic UI)]]

Users [[upgrading]] from previous versions will automatically keep the classic interface. For those who are installing for the first time or re-installing, it is possible to bypass the Vuze layer by going to Tools&gt;Options, Interface&gt;Start&gt; and selecting &quot;Classic Interface&quot; from the VUZE UI Chooser.

The main noticeable difference between the classic interface and the main interface is the header and footer. In addition, Vuze Network features are unavailable.

While downloading a file under the classic or advanced interface, the user can view several different statistics including:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azureuswiki.com/ |title=Main Page - AzureusWiki |publisher=AzureusWiki&lt;! |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Current download and upload speeds and [[estimated]] time remaining.
* The percentage of each file completed and information on the &quot;pieces&quot; (small parts of the complete file) still needed including the piece number and availability.
* File names, sizes and levels of completion for specific files within the download [[Directory (file systems)|directory]].
* Peer data including [[IP addresses]], the speeds at which you are downloading and uploading to/from them, the port they are running BitTorrent on, and the BitTorrent client they are using.
* The total and average &quot;swarm speeds.&quot;
* Advanced statistics including [[ratio]], overall [[upload]]/download, session upload/download, network, upload/download limit estimate, [[cache]] activity, and distributed [[database]] details.

==== Advanced interface ====

The &quot;advanced&quot; interface combines features of the classic and main interfaces. Noticeable differences include a change of header and footer, and the preservation of the Vuze Network layer. It can be changed via the UI chooser, or by clicking advanced in the Vuze/Main UI.

=== Azureus ===
[[Image:Azureus screenshot ubuntu.png|right|thumb|Azureus]]

Azureus was first released in June 2003 at SourceForge.net. The blue poison dart frog (''[[Dendrobates azureus]]'') was chosen as the logo and named by co-creator [[Tyler Pitchford]]. This choice was due to Latin names of poison dart frogs being used as codenames for his development projects.

=== Vuze ===
In 2006 &quot;Vuze&quot;  was released as an attempt to transform the client into a &quot;social&quot; client by a group of the original developers forming Azureus Inc., shortly to be renamed [[Vuze, Inc.]] A Vuze-free version of Azureus was released along with Vuze during the beta period. The releases used version numbers 3.0, while the Vuze-free versions continued with the 2.5 release numbers. &lt;!--Verify--&gt; The first reaction to the change was met with confusion, because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apcmag.com/azureus_is_dead_long_live_vuze.htm |title=Confusion about name change |publisher=Apcmag.com |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some of the developers voiced opposition to the idea of completely transforming the client.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}&lt;!--is fact--&gt;  Starting with an unknown version, Vuze was coupled with Azureus.  Soon after, &quot;NoVuze&quot; modified versions were released on [[The Pirate Bay]], and as of September 15 {{Year needed|date=October 2010}}, are available for versions up to 3.1.1.0.  On June 16, 2008, the developers of Azureus/Vuze decided to stop releasing versions named Azureus, and complete the name change with the release of version 3.1. &lt;!--Verify--&gt; The client engine however, remains unchanged as Azureus.

=== License change ===
Up to version 2.5.0.4, Azureus was distributed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL); beginning with the version 3 distribution, the license presented upon installation changed.  While it still states that the &quot;Azureus Application&quot; is available under the GPL, completing installation requires the user to agree to the terms of the &quot;Vuze Platform,&quot; which include restrictions on use, reverse-engineering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vuze.com/Terms.html |title=Section 8.12 |publisher=Vuze.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sublicensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vuze.com/Terms.html |title=Section 8.2 |publisher=Vuze.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with many similar licenses, the Azureus licence includes a prohibition on use of the software by people &quot;under the age of 18.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vuze.com/Terms.html |title=Section 1 and Section 8.10 |publisher=Vuze.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Allegedly, the [[Terms of service|TOS]] only applies to the website, vuze.com, and not the software,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://azureuswiki.com/index.php/Azureus_2_and_Vuze#Is_it_still_GPL.3F |title=Azureus 2 / 3 and Vuze |publisher=AzureusWiki |date=2008-06-27 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the actual TOS include the application as part of the platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vuze.com/Terms.html |title=Section 0 |publisher=Vuze.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vuze To Go ===
In May 2009, Vuze collaborated with company named [[Ceedo]] and created a portable version Vuze called Vuze To Go; however, this portable version is not free.

== Criticism ==
Vuze is categorized as [[Adware]] by [[Softpedia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/File-Sharing/Azureus.shtml  |title=Download Vuze (formerly Azureus) 4.2.0.5 Beta 03 / 4.2.0.4  Stable Free Trial -  A freeware Java based BitTorrent client |publisher=Softpedia |date=  |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its  inclusion of a Vuze Toolbar for web browsers.

[[CNET]] says Vuze is &quot;[[bloatware|bloated]] but happy,&quot; but still rates the  application with a perfect Editor's Rating score of 5 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=sadekamr |date=July 10,  2009 |url=http://download.cnet.com/Vuze/3000-2196_4-10295479.html  |title=Vuze -  Free software downloads and reviews - CNET Download.com  |publisher=Download.cnet.com |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  February 2010, two of the largest music sharing sites decided to ban the use of  Vuze by their members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=TEAM FILEnetworks|url=http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2010/02/vuze-and-deluge-to-be-banned-on-whatcd.html |title=Vuze and  Deluge to be banned|publisher=FILEnetworks Blog  |date=2010-02-20  |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vuze includes built-in support for [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] (The Onion Router), an anonymity network. The [[onion routing|onion routers]] are run by volunteers using their own bandwidth at their own cost. Due to the high bandwidth usage caused by the [[BitTorrent protocol]], it is considered impolite and inappropriate by Tor community members to use the Tor network for BitTorrent transfers.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO/BitTorrent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.torproject.org/blog/why-tor-is-slow&lt;/ref&gt; By default, the Tor exit policy blocks the standard BitTorrent ports.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#Istherealistofdefaultexitports.3F&lt;/ref&gt;
