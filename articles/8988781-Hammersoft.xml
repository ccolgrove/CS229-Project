The '''2004 Penn State Nittany Lions football team''' represented the [[Pennsylvania State University]] in the [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004 college football season]]. The team's head coach was [[Joe Paterno]]. It played its home games at [[Beaver Stadium]] in [[University Park, Pennsylvania]].

==Preseason==
The spring saw some changes to the coaching staff. Offensive coordinator [[Fran Ganter]] was named the new Associate Athletic Director for Football Administration, after 37 years as a player and coach for Penn State. Former Penn State quarterback [[Galen Hall]] joined the coaching staff as the new offensive coordinator and running backs coach. [[Mike McQueary]], another former Penn State quarterback, joins the staff as the wide receivers coach and will also serve as the recruiting coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;coachingchanges&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the coaching changes, head coach [[Joe Paterno]] had his contract extended through the 2008&amp;nbsp;football season, despite having had three losing seasons in the past four.&lt;ref name=&quot;joepaextension&quot;/&gt;

Last season's second-leading receiver Maurice Humphrey was expelled from school and convicted of three counts of simple assault. He would not play another down for Penn State. Humphrey's expulsion created a void of experience at the wide receiver position. Senior [[Gerald Smith (football)|Gerald Smith]] was the most experienced receiver, and he had only 15 catches in 2003.

Prior to the season, [[Zack Mills]] and [[Cameron Wake|Derek Wake]] were elected team co-captains by their teammates.&lt;ref name=&quot;captains&quot;/&gt;

Penn State started the season unranked in both the [[Associated Press|AP]] and the [[Coaches Poll|Coaches]] college football preseason polls.

}}

The overwhelmed Zips find themselves behind 41â3 at halftime against Penn State, who subs in the backups, Penn State scores once in the third to make it 48â3, and Akron scores a late, meaningless touchdown against the Lions to bring the score to 48â10, with this being Galen Hall's first game as an offensive coordinator. This game gave Penn State fans false hope that their team was on the rebound from their 3â9 season last year. ESPN described the offense as &quot;looking unstoppable&quot;, which led to the Lions being favored over Boston College the following week.

{{-}}

===Boston College===

|R1=0||R2=0||R3=7||R4=0||RT=7
|Home='''Boston College'''
|H1=7||H2=7||H3=7||H4=0||HT=21
}}

Boston College takes a 14â0 halftime lead at home over the Nittany Lions, and then takes a 21â7 lead after three for the game's final points. Sloppy play on offense ultimately doomed Penn State as Boston College becomes the first of three teams to score 20 or more points on a defense that didn't allow more than 21 points all year and the only team to score 21 offensive points on the Nittany Lions.

}}

Despite sloppy play and mistakes, the Golden Knights couldn't help but find themselves blown out by a much better Penn State team. After falling behind 3â0 in the first quarter, the Nittany Lions make it 21â6 at halftime and 30â6 after three thanks to a touchdown and a safety. The backups are subbed in for the fourth, both teams score, and it's 37â13 as the final score.

}}

In a defensive game, three of Penn State's quarterbacks were injured. Zack Mills was knocked out for the game, sustained a concussion, and backup Michael Robinson was taken away in an [[ambulance]] after sustaining life-threatening injuries from a vicious hit. Third stringer Chris Ganter did little against the Badgers' defense with Penn State only managing a field goal in the third quarter, barely preserving their streak of games without being shut out. Wisconsin only scored 16 points, which was well below their average for the year.

{{see also|2004 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team}}

After the game, Minnesota players had said that they hadn't seen a defense of Penn State's caliber before, but won because of Penn State's offensive weaknesses, still, Penn State's defense kept them in the game for the majority of the game, which would be true for every game this season.

}}

Purdue managed only their second Big Ten win in history over Penn State by holding on for a 20â13 win at Beaver Stadium. It was a 10â10 tie and 17â13 after three, but Purdue's final field goal was enough to win it. Purdue's historic losses to Penn State include a loss in 2000 to a 5â7 Nittany Lions team while Purdue themselves were Big Ten champions, representing themselves at the Rose Bowl.

}}

This is a game that by many Penn State fans was considered a low point for the football program because of the inept offenses and the fact that the only Penn State scores were defensive. The Penn State defense effectively shut down the Hawkeyes, forcing two first half field goals, but was unable to get anything going on offense. Penn State took a 2â0 lead on a safety early in the game, but the Hawkeyes had a field goal to make it 3â2, then another to make it 6â2 at halftime. The Hawkeyes barely gained any ground in the second half, and the Nittany Lions got their final two points from an elective safety in the fourth quarter because Iowa feared that Penn State would block the punt in the end zone, taking the lead on a touchdown, because they had already blocked a few punts that day. The strategy worked, Penn State coughed up the ball on their next drive and Iowa took a knee to kill the clock. While this game was a low point for Penn State, it was a big game for the Hawkeyes because head coach [[Kirk Ferentz]]'s father died the week before.

===Ohio State===

|H1=14||H2=7||H3=0||H4=0||HT=21
}}

Ohio State scored a defensive and special teams touchdown, but Penn State's defense mostly kept them out of the end zone in a 21â10 loss, one of two times they scored double digits in the Horseshoe as a Big 10 team, the other time being in 2008 where they won 13â6 to take control of the Big Ten race. Penn State actually outscored the Buckeyes 10â7 offensively.

Penn State held the momentum and controlled the tempo of most of the game, but couldn't quite put the Wildcats away, despite having a few opportunities to, including a missed field goal and a drive that ended at the Northwestern 18, losing another close game 7â14.

}}

This is the game that is said to have turned Penn State's fortunes around. In the same way that the 1999 upset loss to Minnesota was believed to begin a downward spiral called &quot;The Dark Years&quot; by Penn State fans, this close game that ended with a four down goal line stand very late in the game, with Penn State clinging to a 22â16 lead, is said to have been the game that started Penn State on the winning track again and springboarded the team towards the 2005 Big Ten championship. Indiana managed a 13â7 halftime lead, but late in the game found themselves down 22â16, only scoring a field goal but leading 16â14 until Penn State took the lead on a late touchdown and two point conversion. Penn State stopped Indiana four straight times at the goal line, eventually conceding a safety on the final play of the game to prevent Indiana from having a chance to win. Penn State's goal line stand at Indiana as a result of the momentum it gave the team is considered one of the best Penn State games.

The Spartans of Michigan State were 5â5, hoping to become bowl eligible, and the only thing standing in their way was a 3â7 Penn State team who only had one Big Ten win, but the goal line stand at Indiana that led to the Penn State victory the previous week gave them the momentum to win this game big. After a slow first half where Michigan State led 6â3, Penn State rolled off 28 third quarter points to put the game out of reach, going up 31â6 on the Spartans thanks to a plethora of interceptions. Penn State would kick two more field goals in the last quarter while the Spartans scored a late touchdown against backups.

==Post season==
The offense did not get going until the third quarter of the final game, but the defense finished the season in the top 10 in four NCAA statistical categories and was the only team in the nation to not allow more than 21 points a game. The Nittany Lion defense ranked fifth in scoring defense (15.3 points per game), ranked tenth in total defense (291.55&amp;nbsp;yards per game), ranked sixth in pass defense (162.3 ypg), ranked fourth in pass efficiency defense (99.8 rating), and held all 11 opponents below their total offense average.&lt;ref name=&quot;defense&quot;/&gt;

Despite the losing record, Penn State ranked among the top four in attendance for the 14th consecutive year, averaging 103,111 in six home games, including attendances of 108,183 against Purdue and 108,062 against Iowa, the ninth and tenth largest crowds in Beaver Stadium history.&lt;ref name=&quot;attendance&quot;/&gt;

None of the departing players were drafted in the [[2005 NFL Draft]], but a number of players signed with NFL teams as free agents.
