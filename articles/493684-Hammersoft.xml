He played [[college football]] at [[Clemson University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://clemsontigers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/clark_dwight00.html Clemson&lt;/ref&gt; before being drafted by the 49ers in the 10th round of the [[1979 NFL Draft|1979]] entry draft.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/tag/_/name/dwight-clark ESPN&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Arrival at the 49ers===
In [[1979 NFL season|1979]], the head coach of the 49ers, [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]], went to Clemson to evaluate that school's promising quarterback, [[Steve Fuller (football player)|Steve Fuller]]. While there, Walsh discovered Clark. According to a story Clark shared while being interviewed on [[WDNC (AM)|WDNC]] radio on July 31, 2007, Walsh had called the number for the [[dormitory]] room where Fuller and Clark were living, hoping to reach Fuller. Instead, Clark, who was on his way out to play [[golf]], answered the phone. Upon learning that Fuller was not in, Walsh asked Clark to identify himself, and invited Clark to run routes for Fuller so Walsh could watch Fuller more closely.

===NFL career===
Bill Walsh drafted Dwight Clark as the first pick of the 10th round of the 1979 NFL draft. Clark embarked on a stellar  career for 49ers in which he had 506 catches for 6750 yards and 48 touchdowns, along with 50 rushing yards. He led the NFL in receptions (60) during the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], and made the [[Pro Bowl]] twice in [[1981 Pro Bowl|1981]] and [[1982 Pro Bowl|1982]] in his 9 NFL seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pfref&quot;&gt;http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/ClarDw00.htm Pro Footbal Reference&lt;/ref&gt;

After Walsh drafted Clark, he made Clark and quarterback Joe Montana practice a certain 20-yard roll-out &quot;Hail Mary&quot; pass into the end zone at the end of every practice. Walsh wanted to make sure that they could complete that certain pass in the red zone.

====&quot;The Catch&quot;====
Clark's most memorable touchdown came in the [[NFL playoffs, 1981#NFC: San Francisco 49ers 28.2C Dallas Cowboys 27|1982 NFC Playoffs]]. On January 10, 1982, against the [[Dallas Cowboys]], the [[San Francisco 49ers]] were trailing 27&amp;ndash;21 in the final minute of play to advance to the [[Super Bowl XVI|Super Bowl]]. Clark leaped and caught a six-yard pass from quarterback [[Joe Montana]] in the back of the end zone to give the 49ers a 28&amp;ndash;27 victory. That play, one of the most famous in the history in the NFL, has been immortalized as &quot;[[The Catch (NFL)|The Catch]]&quot; practiced as the &quot;Hail Mary.&quot; Clark finished the game with eight receptions for 120 yards and 2 touchdowns.

During the 1981 season, Coach Walsh had Montana and Clark routinely practice the 20-yard end-zone throw after regular practice.

====Retirement and Legacy====
After nine successful seasons with [[San Francisco 49ers]], Dwight Clark retired after 1987 NFL season. Clark was a member of two Super Bowl-winning teams. To honor Clark's contribution to 49ers, the club retired his number 87. After retirement, he has served as a team executive for both the San Francisco 49ers and the [[Cleveland Browns]].

Clark has also appeared in the video game, [[All-Pro Football 2K8]].

===Personal life===
Clark was born in [[Kinston, North Carolina]] and graduated from [[Garinger High School]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pfref&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=brn&gt;{{cite news|title=The Catch Looms Larger Than Life .|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VjVUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Oo0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6629,4031256&amp;dq=garinger+high+school+dwight+clark&amp;hl=en|accessdate=15 February 2011|newspaper=[[Boca Raton News]]|date=18 January 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
