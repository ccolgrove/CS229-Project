The system is aimed at small retailers such as bakeries and cafÃ©s and intended for purchases of less than â¬30.

The card is inserted into a handheld Moneo reader by the merchant who enters the transaction amount for the customer. The customer then confirms the purchase by pushing a button on the keypad; the exact amount is debited from the card within a few seconds.

As well as the multipurpose bank card version, anonymous cards (also [[smart cards]]) are available for the use of people without bank accounts, such as children and tourists.

Supported by all French banks, Moneo was tested in [[Brittany]] in 2002, and from 2004 Moneo has been added to most French bank cards.
