The [[2010 NFL season|2010]] [[Washington Redskins]] season was the 78th [[Washington Redskins seasons|season]] for the team in the [[National Football League]] (NFL), and their first under new head coach [[Mike Shanahan]], who also began his term as the team's Vice President of Football Operations. The Redskins obtained the 4th pick in the [[2010 NFL Draft]] as a result of their 4-12 record from their previous season, which they used to draft [[Oklahoma University|Oklahoma]] tackle [[Trent Williams]]. Finishing the season 6-10, the Redskins improved on their 4â12 record from the [[2009 Washington Redskins season|2009]] season, but were officially eliminated from postseason contention in Week 14. Of the 16 games of the season, only four (all losses) were decided by more than a single possession. 

With new starting quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]], who replaced [[Jason Campbell]] (traded to [[Oakland Raiders|Oakland]]), Washington aimed to improve upon their previous failing seasons. However, upon Week 15 and a rating of 77.1 (25th overall in the league), Shanahan would bench McNabb in favor of their second-string [[Rex Grossman]] (who was the quarterback for the [[2006 Chicago Bears season|2006 Chicago Bears]] that went to play in the Super Bowl).

===Movement===
The Redskins released [[running back|RBs]] [[Rock Cartwright]] and [[Ladell Betts]], [[wide receiver|WR]] [[Antwaan Randle El]], [[offensive guard|OG]] [[Randy Thomas (American football)|Randy Thomas]], [[defensive tackle|DT]] [[Cornelius Griffin]] and [[cornerback|CB]] [[Fred Smoot]] on March 4, 2010, one day before the start of [[free agency]].

On April 4, the Redskins traded a 2010 2nd round pick and either a 3rd or 4th round pick in 2011 for veteran Eagles QB [[Donovan McNabb]]. The conditional 3rd/4th round pick is reflective on McNabb's performance during the season.

On April 24, the Redskins traded [[Quarterback|QB]] [[Jason Campbell]] to the [[Oakland Raiders]] for a 2012 4th round pick. The Jason Campbell trade had been anticipated ever since the Donovan McNabb trade a few weeks before.

On June 19, the Redskins addressed their need for a strong offensive line by trading a third or fourth in 2011 (reflective on the Donovan McNabb trade) to the [[New Orleans Saints]] for Pro Bowl OT [[Jammal Brown]].

The Redskins entered Week 17 as a spoiler in the New York Giants' run for the playoffs. In a game full of turnovers, New York gained the early upper hand with a 20 yard field goal from [[Lawrence Tynes]]. In the second quarter, the Giants added 7 more points to their score after a 2 yard run from [[Brandon Jacobs]]. Washington would put their first points on the board with a 1 yard pass from [[Rex Grossman]] to [[Fred Davis (tight end)|Fred Davis]] to conclude the scoring for the first half. The Giants went up by another seven points upon [[Mario Manningham]]'s 92 yard reception from [[Eli Manning]]. The Redskins would answer with a a 64 yard pass from Grossman to [[Anthony Armstrong (American football)|Anthony Armstrong]], leaving the differential of the score to a field goal. In Washington's final possession, Grossman would lead the team to a turn over on downs; with no timeouts, the New York Giants would win the game (although due to Green Bay's superior head-to-head tiebreaker advantage, unable to qualify for the playoffs) and the Redskins would end their season by falling to 6-10 but surpassing their previous season's record of 4-12.
