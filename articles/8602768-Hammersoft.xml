== Life and career ==
=== Early life and training ===
Kerry Jane Ellis was born on 6 May 1979 in [[Haughley]], a small village near [[Stowmarket]], Suffolk to her mother Sandra Ann Reed and father Terry John Ellis. Describing herself as a hyperactive young girl, she attended dance classes and enjoyed performing in local shows and pantomimes as well as swimming and horse-riding.&lt;ref name=&quot;EADT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Wolsey to the West End|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/entertainment/from_the_wolsey_to_the_west_end_1_303738|work=East Anglia Daily Times|date=14 June 2010|last=Clarke|first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 9, her first role on the stage was in an amateur production of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 stage play)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' at the [[New Wolsey Theatre|Wolsey Theatre]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EADT&quot; /&gt; where she played a [[Munchkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerry Ellis|url=http://mag.bent.com/2008/05/kerry-ellis/|work=[[Bent (magazine)|Bent]]|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=18 January 2011|first=Terry|last=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; She cites her early influences as [[Liza Minnelli]] and [[Barbra Streisand]]; their music she would sing much to the disturbance of her older brother, Andrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet the new Elphaba, Kerry Ellis|url=http://www.ivillage.co.uk/newspol/celeb/cint/articles/0,,528729_705814,00.html|work=iVillage|date=Undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she stated that she had not discovered her vocal ability until she was at college and had started working.&lt;ref name=&quot;GayDar&quot; /&gt; While attending [[Stowmarket High School]], she completed work experience with Starmakers, a company of holiday entertainers at Potters Leisure Resort in [[Hopton-on-Sea]], Norfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iâd do anything...Kerry Ellis goes from stage to studio|url=http://www.placesandfaces.co.uk/articles/61/id-do-anything-kerry-ellis-goes-from-stage-to-studio.html|work=Places and Faces|last=Richardson|first=Sharon|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, she spent the summers of 1995 and 1997 with the Starmakers to sing in [[cabaret]]-style performances and appear in many of their shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerry Ellis' profile at Starmaker's tribute website|url=http://starmakers.connectfree.co.uk/htmfiles/ellisk01.htm|publisher=Official site of the Starmakers|date=Undated|accessdate=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having left school at 16, Ellis turned to [[Laine Theatre Arts]], an independent performing arts college, where she would stay for the next three years receiving formal stage training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Students from Laine Theatre Arts as of March 2011|url=http://www.laine-theatre-arts.co.uk/pdfs/News%20of%20Laine%20Theatre%20Arts%20Graduates%20updated%20March%202011.pdf|work=Official website of Laine Theatre Arts|date=March 2009|accessdate=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career beginnings and ''My Fair Lady'' ===
After graduating at Laine Theatre Arts in 1998, she was credited as the first understudy for [[Marti Webb]] in a UK concert tour of ''The Magic of the Musicals'', where she was required on several occasions in Webb's absence.&lt;ref name=&quot;EADT&quot;/&gt; However, Ellis spent a nine month hiatus from the tour to work on the cruise ship [[MS Voyager of the Seas|MS ''Voyager of the Seas'']] in 1999. Deciding to gain an experience different to that she had in theatre, Ellis was employed as a lead vocalist as part of the liner's entertainment schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;EADT&quot;/&gt; After this engagement, her professional theatrical credits had included Mary in ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' at the [[Yvonne Arnaud Theatre]] and lead female roles in pantomimes ''Dick Whittington'', ''Aladdin'' and ''Cinderella'' across theatres in the UK. Additionally, she had appeared as the title role in a [[Gary Griffin]]-directed workshop production titled ''Helen of Troy'' and made her first television appearance on ''[[Children in Need]]'' in 1999, where she was involved in ''Pudsey the Musical'' while the same year, she was featured in a jingle for [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]].

Ellis marked her West End debut by joining the original cast of [[Cameron Mackintosh]]'s London revival of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' in late 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;personal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal recounts of Ellis' career in theatre|url=http://www.kerryellis.co.uk/theatre/|work=Official website of Kerry Ellis|author=Ellis, Kerry|date=Undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed [[Understudy|swing]]&lt;ref name=&quot;personal&quot;/&gt; and became the second understudy to [[Martine McCutcheon]] in the role of Eliza Doolittle. The musical initially played at the [[Lyttelton Theatre]] from 6 March 2001 to 20 June 2001 but later transferred to [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] with shows beginning 21 July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Â£4.7m Makes My Fair Lady West Endâs Fastest Seller|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E882985766960/%A34.7m+Makes+My+Fair+Lady+West+End%92s+Fastest+Seller.html|work=What's On Stage|location=London|date=28 March 2001|author=Paddock, Terri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to McCutcheon's illness during the production's run at both theatres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Life with lots of Doolittles|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4724679/Life-with-lots-of-Doolittles.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=24 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis played Eliza Doolittle on five occasions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=...and her understudy's understudy Kerry Ellis five times|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/call-for-refunds-if-stars-are-absent-from-shows-662213.html|work=The Independent|location=London|date=30 June 2001|author=Lister, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite [[Jonathan Pryce]] and [[Dennis Waterman]]. Upon reflection, she stated that it was &quot;fantastic&quot; to gain experience from the cast and creative team of ''My Fair Lady''.&lt;ref name=&quot;personal&quot;/&gt; Ellis departed from the company in early 2002.

=== ''We Will Rock You'', ''Miss Saigon'' and ''Les MisÃ©rables'' ===
{{rquote|right|&quot;From the moment I first heard Kerry sing, I was entranced, and felt the conviction that I would one day make an album for her. That conviction never left me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;atc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Cumming Back, Brian May Backs Ellis Anthem|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831292826793/Cumming+Back,+Brian+May+Backs+Ellis+Anthem.html|date=20 December 2010|accessdate=30 December 2010|first1=Theo|last1=Bosanquet|first2=Terri|last2=Paddock|work=What's On Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;small&gt;â Brian May&lt;/small&gt;}}
After attending a performance of ''My Fair Lady'' where Ellis played Doolittle, [[Brian May]] (who attended with [[Ben Elton]]) encouraged her to audition for the debut of their [[jukebox musical]] ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='ANTHEMS' by Kerry Ellis produced by Brian May|url=http://www.queenonline.com/news/1736/|work=Official site of the band Queen|date=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EADT2&quot;/&gt; After one audition,{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} she was cast in the role of Meat, her only original role to date. She began performances on 14 May 2002, and was also involved in television appearances with the cast on ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', ''Party in the Park'' and [[Party at the Palace|the Queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations]]. She stated that working with May, Elton and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] was &quot;a great step forward&quot; in her professional career; calling her journey &quot;breath-taking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;personal&quot; /&gt; Ellis, who ended her run as Meat on 17 April 2004, is also featured on the [[We Will Rock You (The Original London Cast Recording)|original London cast recording of ''We Will Rock You'']]. While in the musical, Ellis started to create the foundations of her musical career after Brian May became interested in working with her musically. Her time in ''We Will Rock You'' allowed the pair to collaborate and in 2002 the pair recorded an orchestral version of the song &quot;[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)#Kerry Ellis version|No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GayDar&quot; /&gt; This version was digitally released three years later but failed to chart on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

After leaving ''We Will Rock You'', Ellis played [[Eva Cassidy]] in a 2004 workshop production of ''Way Beyond Blue'', a [[Trevor Nunn]]-directed and [[Imogen Stubbs]]-written piece&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ticketmaster Interviews: Kerry Ellis|url=http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/feature/interviews/int_kerry_ellis.html?tm_link=interview_kerry_ellis_link1|work=Ticketmaster|location=London|date=Undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to being cast as Ellen in a UK tour of ''[[Miss Saigon]]'' â again pairing up with producer Cameron Mackintosh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miss Saigon â UK Tour|url=http://www.miss-saigon.com/latestnews/newsarticle.php?newskey=10|work=Official website of the UK tour of Miss Saigon|author=Mackintosh, Cameron|date=Undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went into rehearsals for ''Miss Saigon'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] in [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] before performances commenced on 14 June 2004 at the [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth|Theatre Royal]] in [[Plymouth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Miss Saigon Production Begins UK Tour, July&amp;nbsp;14|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/86887-New-Miss-Saigon-Production-Begins-UK-Tour-July-14|work=Playbill|location=New York|last=Inverne|first=James|date=14 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company toured theatres across the UK, however, Ellis had to prematurely disembark from the production on 9 June 2005, shortly prior to the end of the tour's run, due to the rehearsal requirement in her next musical role. While still in the touring production of ''Miss Saigon'', Ellis rehearsed for four weeks&lt;ref name=&quot;personal&quot; /&gt; in order to play her next lead role in London's West End â [[Fantine]] in ''[[Les MisÃ©rables (musical)|Les MisÃ©rables]]''. She began performing the role of Fantine on 27 June 2005 at the [[Queen's Theatre]] alongside [[John Owen-Jones]], [[Shonagh Daly]], [[Shaun Escoffery]] and [[Hayden Tee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owen-Jones &amp; John Headline Les Mis from 27&amp;nbsp;Jun|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8821011900968/Clarke+%26+Hanson+Join+Planer+in+Rock+You+Cast.html|work=What's on Stage|date=22 June 2005|accessdate=17 January 2011|first=Terri|last=Paddock}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing Fantine for almost a year, Ellis ended her time with the company on 24 June 2006.

=== ''Wicked'', ''Chess'', Broadway, extended play and other ventures ===
In mid 2006, Ellis joined the original London cast of the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' to play [[Elphaba]]. Serving as a temporary standby to [[Idina Menzel]] â who originated the lead role on Broadway â from the show's opening in London on 7 September 2006 to 30 December 2006, Ellis played Elphaba on nine occasions at the [[Apollo Victoria Theatre]] in Menzel's absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WickedUK ~ Oz Dust Confidential|url=http://www.wickeduk.co.uk/odc/index.php?id=kerryellis|publisher=Wicked (UK) â a fansite|date=Undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Menzel's pre-planned departure, Ellis took over the full-time position in the role three months after the show had opened on 1 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=She's wicked, but not nasty|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-424290/Shes-wicked-nasty.html|publisher=The Daily Mail|location=London|author=Bamigboye, Baz|date=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis, who played the misunderstood Wicked Witch of the West, played alongside [[Dianne Pilkington]] as [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]], the Good Witch of the North. The pair remain the show's longest serving leads.&lt;ref name=&quot;EADT2&quot;/&gt; For the role of Elphaba, Ellis won the award for Best Takeover in a Role at the 2008 [[Theatregoers' Choice Award|Whatsonstage.com Theatregoers' Choice Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full List: Your Theatregoersâ Choice Award Winners|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8821203624757/Full+List%3A+Your+Theatregoers%92+Choice+Award+Winners.html|publisher=What's on Stage|location=London|date=22 February 2008|accessdate=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the Favourite Theatre Actress award at the 2007 [[Lastminute.com]] People's Choice Theatre Awards; losing to [[Connie Fisher]] for her role as [[Maria von Trapp]] in ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. Her time in ''Wicked'' enabled her to make numerous appearances at concerts where she sang songs from the musical. Her debut at various London events came in 2007 including West End Live in [[Leicester Square]]; Walk for Life in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]; Kids Week in [[Covent Garden]]; and the annual [[Pride London|Gay Pride Festival]] in [[Trafalgar Square]] as well as on lunchtime chat-show ''[[Loose Women]]'' where she performed, as Elphaba, the ''Wicked'' song &quot;[[The Wizard and I]]&quot;.

While still performing the role of Elphaba, Ellis appeared alongside Idina Menzel, [[Adam Pascal]] and [[Josh Groban]], [[Clarke Peters]], [[Marti Pellow]] and [[David Bedella]] in a two-day limited engagement of ''[[Chess (musical)#Royal Albert Hall, 2008|Chess in Concert]]'' at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] on 12 and 13 May 2008. She played the role of Svetlana and upon reflection, stated that to star at the Royal Albert Hall, work with an &quot;amazing&quot; company and sing alongside those particular cast members &quot;was a dream come true.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;personal&quot;/&gt; Although a relative unknown and in a small part, Ellis was met with positive reviews for her performance. A critic labelled her stronger than Menzel â who attained the female lead â and argued that Ellis should have received it instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tyro Theatre Critic: Chess in Concert|url=http://tttcritic.blogspot.com/2008/05/chess-in-concert.html|work=A Blogspot: TTTCrtitic|first=Rob|last=Walport|date=14 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She continued the role of Elphaba in London until 7 June 2008 when she temporarily departed from the Apollo Victoria Theatre, to be succeeded by [[Alexia Khadime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khadime Plays Wicked Elphaba, Ellis Back 1&amp;nbsp;Dec|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/index.php?pg=207&amp;story=E8821207071697|date=2 April 2008|work=What's On Stage|location=London|last=Paddock|first=Terri}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transferred to the Broadway production of ''Wicked'' at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] with performances starting on 17 June of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wicked witch Kerry Ellis has a magic touch|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/columnists/article-547937/Wicked-witch-Kerry-Ellis-magic-touch.html|last=Bamigboye|first=Baz|work=The Daily Mail|location=London|date=28 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She replaced stage actress [[Stephanie J.

She refers to the transfer from West End to Broadway theatre as &quot;a real honour [and] a joy&quot;; adding that performing on Broadway was &quot;a dream come true.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OK!&quot;/&gt; During her time in the United States, her first extended play ''[[Wicked in Rock]]'' was released in July 2008. Produced by Brian May and [[Steve Sidwell (musician)|Steve Sidwell]], the album comprises three tracks: two are new orchestrations of songs from ''Wicked''; the other is Queen song &quot;No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)&quot;.

Upon the subject of the concerts, she commented, &quot;It's finally something that I can do as me, as opposed to being in a show as a character.

In December 2009, it was announced that Ellis would replace [[Jodie Prenger]] in the role of [[Nancy (Oliver Twist)|Nancy]] in Cameron Mackintosh's London revival of ''[[Oliver!]]'' at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane â Ellis' return to the stage for the first time in almost a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadway &amp; West End Star Kerry Ellis to play 'Nancy'|url=http://www.oliverthemusical.com/news/kerry-ellis-nancy.php|work=Official website for Oliver!|date=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opening on 29 March 2010 to positive reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kerry Ellis gives Oliver! new oom-pah-pah|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/photos/theatre/london/E8831269958141/Photos%3A+Kerry+Ellis+Gives+Oliver!+New+Oom-pah-pah+.html|work=What's On Stage|location=London|date=30 March 2010|first=Terri|last=Paddock}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starring alongside both [[Griff Rhys Jones]] and [[Russ Abbot]] as [[Fagin]] and [[Steven Hartley]] as [[Bill Sikes]], she was the second actress to play Nancy in the London revival, but also the final, and continued the role until the end of the show's run on 8 January 2011. Ellis was nominated for the 2010 BroadwayWorld.com UK Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical but lost to [[Sheridan Smith]] for her role as [[Elle Woods]] in ''[[Legally Blonde (musical)|Legally Blonde]]'' and was also nominated for the 2011 Whatsonstage.com Theatregoers' Choice Award for Best Takeover in a Role; losing to [[Rachel Tucker]] who coincidentally won for her role as Elphaba in ''Wicked'' (the same role that Ellis won the award for in 2008). 

Appearing on ''[[Over the Rainbow (2010 TV series)|Over The Rainbow]]'', a televised BBC talent show competition, that searched for a [[Dorothy Gale]] for the [[The Wizard of Oz (2011 musical)|2011 musical adaptation of ''The Wizard of Oz'']], Ellis served as a mentor towards potential candidates in late March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Dorothys &amp; Wild Card Battle Over the Rainbow|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831269856306/Ten+Dorothys+%26+Wild+Card+Battle+Over+the+Rainbow.html|date=29 March 2010|accessdate=17 January 2011|work=What's on Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous year, Ellis had appeared as a mentor in another of BBC's talent shows ''[[I'd Do Anything (BBC TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]'' where she mentored potential Nancys (including Jodie Prenger) â a role she would eventually take â in the fore-running to the opening of the 2009 London revival of the musical ''Oliver!''. Performing at the Royal Albert Hall once again in May 2010, she lent her vocal ability to a performance titled The Night of 1000 Voices, dedicated to the eightieth birthday of American composer and lyricist [[Stephen Sondheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voices Sing for Sondheim, New York Xmas Cast|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831257273547/Voices+Sing+for+Sondheim,+New+York+Xmas+Cast.html|date=4 November 2009|accessdate=17 January 2010|first1=Terri|last1=Paddock|first2=Theo|last2=Bosanquet|publisher=What's on Stage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, she performed &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; with Only Men Aloud! at the [[Wales Millennium Centre]] in [[Cardiff]] at an event called A Weekend with the Stars while October saw an appearance at the [[Hackney Empire]] where she sang the ''Oliver!'' song &quot;[[As Long as He Needs Me]]&quot; at an event celebrating the eightieth anniversary of the birth of composer [[Lionel Bart]]. The last two performances were later broadcast in December on British television channel [[S4C]] and on BBC Radio 2 respectively.

Ellis' debut studio album ''[[Anthems (Kerry Ellis album)|Anthems]]'' was released in mid September 2010. The album, a follow-up to her extended play ''Wicked in Rock'' (2008), peaked at number 15 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Fabricated within the space of nine months and produced by Brian May, Ellis and he recorded the album at [[Abbey Road Studios]] with a 70-piece orchestra.&lt;ref name=&quot;GayDar&quot; /&gt; She described the album as one that &quot;tap[s] into all the different areas that [she has] been part of&quot; in her career between the years 2000 and 2010 â an album that includes both original songs, songs from musicals and concerts she has been in as well as new arrangements of personal favourites. Whilst promoting the album, Ellis appeared on many television shows including ''[[Tonight's the Night (TV series)|Tonight's the Night]]''; ''[[The Michael Ball Show]]''; ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=.Kerry Ellis and Brian May perform spine-tingling rendition of Anthem|url=http://thismorning.itv.com/thismorning/showbiz/kerry-ellis-and-brian-may-perform|work=ITV|date=7 September 2010|first=Gemma|last=Varley|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Alan Titchmarsh Show]]'', as well as performing live at the [[Broadcasting House|BBC Radio Theatre]] and later, London nightclub, [[G-A-Y]].

As well as recording her own material, Ellis has lent her voice to a version of the song &quot;[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]&quot; that features the [[Central Band of the Royal Air Force]] on their album ''Reach for the Skies'' and appears on a version of the song &quot;[[Come What May (2001 song)|Come What May]]&quot; with [[Alfie Boe]] on his album ''[[Bring Him Home (Alfie Boe album)|Bring Him Home]]''. In December 2011, she will join Boe at his concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] to sing the song and &quot;perhaps do a song of her own as well.&quot; Among other participants from the London theatre community, Ellis also lent her voice to &quot;inspirational&quot; videos that were released upon to video-sharing website [[YouTube]] for the &quot;[[It Gets Better Project|It Gets Better]]&quot; campaign â a project created by columnist Dan Savage in response to school bullying and a rash of [[Suicide among LGBT youth|suicides among young LGBT people]] aiming to &quot;provide hope to youth struggling with their identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=West End Theatre Folk Release &quot;It Gets Better&quot; Video|url=http://www.playbill.com/playblog/2011/01/west-end-theatre-folk-release-it-gets-better-video/|work=Playbill|date=17 January 2011|accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
