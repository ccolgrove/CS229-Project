'''Rashid al-Ghannushi''' or '''Rached Ghannouchi''' ({{lang-ar|Ø±Ø§Ø´Ø¯ Ø§ÙØºÙÙØ´Ù}})&lt;ref name=&quot;york&quot;/&gt; (born 1941) is a [[Tunisia]]n [[Islamist]] who co-founded the [[Ennahda Movement]], currently the largest party in Tunisia. He has been called the party's &quot;intellectual leader&quot;.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;

==Biography==
Al-Ghannushi was born outside [[El Hamma]], in the [[GabÃ¨s Governorate|Qabis province]] of southern Tunisia. He received his certificate of attainment degree, equivalent to the [[BaccalaurÃ©at]], in 1962 from the [[Al-Zaytuna Mosque|University of Zaytuna]].  He entered the school of [[agriculture]] at [[Cairo University]] in 1964, but following the expulsion of Tunisians from [[Egypt]] due to the dispute between [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Habib Bourguiba]], he left for [[Syria]].  He studied [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Damascus]], graduating in 1968.  While in [[Damascus]], Al-Ghannushi initially joined the [[Socialist Party]], but later adopted a more religious viewpoint.  He spent a year in [[France]] at the [[Sorbonne]] before returning to [[Tunisia]] and, along with many other Tunisians, established an organization devoted to the reform of Tunisian society based on Islamic principles.

Following an opening of political space {{what|date=October 2011}} in April 1981 by Bourguiba, Al-Ghannushi founded the &quot;al-ittijah al-islami&quot; or Islamic Tendency Movement.  The Movement described itself as specifically rooted in [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] [[Islam]], and called for a &quot;reconstruction of economic life on a more equitable basis, the end of single-party politics and the acceptance of political pluralism and democracy.&quot;  By the end of July, Al-Ghannushi and his followers were arrested, sentenced to eleven years in prison in [[Bizerte]], and were tortured.  Both the religious and secular community, including numerous secular political organizations, rallied in his support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linda G. Jones 1988&quot;&gt;Linda G. Jones, &quot;Portrait of Rashid Al-Ghannoushi&quot; Middle East Report, No. 153 (JulyâAugust 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  He was released in 1984, but returned to prison in 1987 with a life sentence, then was again released in 1988.  He moved to [[Europe]] as a political exile, where he lived for  decades.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;

He attended The Islamic Committee for Palestine conference in Chicago in 1989.&lt;ref name=kintera&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|url=http://www.kintera.org/atf/cf/%7B42D75369-D582-4380-8395-D25925B85EAF%7D/IslamicJihadMovement_July2002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Al-Ghannushi denounced King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for the &quot;colossal crime&quot; of inviting the U.S. to deploy forces.&lt;ref name=visa&gt;{{cite news|title=A U.S. Visa for Rachid Ghannouchi?|url=http://www.martinkramer.org/sandbox/reader/archives/a-u-s-visa-for-rachid-ghannouchi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RachedGhannouchi.jpg|thumb|180px|Rashid Al-Ghannushi speaking in an Islamist rally circa 1980.]]
Al-Ghannushi continued to criticise [[Politics of Tunisia|Tunisian politics]] and the regime of President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]].&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite news |title=More Officials Quit in Tunisia Amid Protests |first1=David D. |last1=Kirkpatrick |first2=Kareem |last2=Fahim |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/world/africa/19tunis.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=More%20officials%20quit%20in%20tunisia&amp;st=cse |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[2010â2011 Tunisian uprising|popular unrest]] in which Ben Ali was ousted, Ghannushi returned to Tunisia on 30 January 2011, after spending twenty two years exiled in [[London]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;issueno=11751&amp;article=606016&amp;feature=|title={{lang-ar|Ø±Ø§Ø´Ø¯ Ø§ÙØºÙÙØ´Ù Ø²Ø¹ÙÙ Ø­Ø±ÙØ© Ø§ÙÙÙØ¶Ø© ÙØ¹ÙØ¯ Ø¥ÙÙ ØªÙÙØ³ Ø§ÙÙÙÙ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ 20 Ø¹Ø§ÙØ§ ÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙÙÙ}}|publisher=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]|date=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Al-Ghannushi has been called &quot;a thought leader in the process of the Islamist embrace of equal citizenship and equal rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite web|last=Feldman |first=Noah |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-30/islamists-victory-in-tunisia-a-win-for-democracy-noah-feldman.html |title=Islamistsâ Victory in Tunisia a Win for Democracy: Noah Feldman |publisher=Bloomberg |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Palestine and the Iraq war===
The Islamic Committee for Palestine held a conference that took place in Chicago from December 22-25, 1989 and featured Al-Ghannushi as a speaker.  Its theme was &quot;Palestine, Intifada, and Horizons of Islamic Renaissance&quot; and other speakers included Abd Al-âAziz AlâAwda, the &quot;spiritual leader&quot; of Islamic Jihad and Muhammad âUmar of [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]], the Islamic Liberation Party.&lt;ref name=kintera/&gt;

Following the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein, Al-Ghannushi denounced King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for the &quot;colossal crime&quot; of inviting the U.S. to deploy forces. Al-Ghannushi supported Saddam more strongly than other Islamists, comparing him to to Yusuf Ibn Tashfin, the 11th-century Almoravid ruler who forcibly unified the Muslim principalities of Spain in order to wrest them from Christian domination. Al-Ghannushi said that, the Muslims now faced &quot;Crusader America,&quot; the &quot;enemy of Islam,&quot; and Saddam had taken a necessary step toward unity, &quot;joining together two Arab states out of twenty-two, praise be to God.&quot; Al-Ghannushi threatened the United States while speaking in Khartoum during the crisis saying &quot;There must be no doubt that we will strike anywhere against whoever strikes Iraq â¦ We must wage unceasing war against the Americans until they leave the land of Islam, or we will burn and destroy all their interests across the entire Islamic worldâ¦ Muslim youth must be serious in their warning to the Americans that a blow to Iraq will be a license to strike American and Western interests throughout the Islamic world.&quot; He also called for a Muslim boycott of American goods, planes and ships.&lt;ref name=visa/&gt;

===Later views===
Al-Ghannushi continued to criticise [[Politics of Tunisia|Tunisian politics]] and the regime of President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]].&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{cite news |title=More Officials Quit in Tunisia Amid Protests |first1=David D. |last1=Kirkpatrick |first2=Kareem |last2=Fahim |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/world/africa/19tunis.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=More%20officials%20quit%20in%20tunisia&amp;st=cse |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[2010â2011 Tunisian uprising|popular unrest]] in which Ben Ali was ousted, Ghannushi returned to Tunisia on 30 January 2011, after spending twenty two years exiled in [[London]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://aawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;issueno=11751&amp;article=606016&amp;feature=|title={{lang-ar|Ø±Ø§Ø´Ø¯ Ø§ÙØºÙÙØ´Ù Ø²Ø¹ÙÙ Ø­Ø±ÙØ© Ø§ÙÙÙØ¶Ø© ÙØ¹ÙØ¯ Ø¥ÙÙ ØªÙÙØ³ Ø§ÙÙÙÙ Ø¨Ø¹Ø¯ 20 Ø¹Ø§ÙØ§ ÙÙ Ø§ÙÙÙÙÙ}}|publisher=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]|date=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Ghannushi claims to represent a progressive strain in Islamic reformism, and continuously stresses the need for innovation against social injustice.  He underscores the importance of local culture, and an Islamist movement based in the needs of Tunisians and not in &quot;the obscure theories of [[Sayyid Qutb]]&quot;.  He has sided with [[worker's rights]], [[unionism]], and [[women's education]] and [[women's rights|rights]], though those rights are based in Islam and not Western [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Linda G. Jones 1988&quot;/&gt;

He maintains that women, being one half of the Islamic community, should have full access to education.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tripp, ''Islam and the Moral Economy,'' Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  He cites oppressive cultural codes in Islamic cultures as the major force behind women's choices to turn to [[Western culture]], and believes that Islamic reform, as part of a larger reformist movement, is needed to address women's education, participation, and respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;&gt;Rashid Al-Ghannoushi and Linda G. Jones, &quot;Deficiencies in the Islamic Movement'' Middle East Report, No. 153 (JulyâAugust 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;For women, there was no path to freedom, knowledge or [[self-determination]] except through a revolt against Islam and its mores and the imitation of the West-until the Islamist movement.  Before the emergence of the Islamist movement, woman found herself in an unstable and decaying society whose &quot;liberation&quot; was purely superficial: nudity, [[eroticism]], leaving the house and the intermingling of the sexes.  So she revolted against these superficial manifestations and called for the return to Islam.  But not without trepidation, because for women the return to Islam still portended a return to the age of decline: the harem, self-negation and the inability to determine her own destiny.&lt;ref name=&quot;report&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In discussions of plurality within Islamic societies, Rashid Al-Ghannushi believes that non-Muslim citizens should not be barred from positions in government, setting himself against more [[conservative]] viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islam21.net/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=76&amp;Itemid=62 Abdelwahab El-Affendi, &quot;Muslims, Citizens and &quot;Neighbors&quot;: Islamism and the Modern Concept of Citizenship&quot; 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2011, in an interview with [[Al Jazeera]] TV, Rashid Al-Ghannushi confirmed that he is against an [[Islamic Caliphate]], and supports [[democracy]] instead, unlike Hizb ut-Tahrir. In the interview, Al-Ghannushi accused Hizb ut-Tahrir of exporting a distorted understanding of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcDWGQG71H4&amp;feature=player_embedded Rashid Al-Ghannushi against Islamic Caliphate and against Hizb ut-Tahrir but supports democracy]&lt;/ref&gt; For expressing moderate views, Rachid Ghanouchi is banned from entering [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Financing Questions Shadow Tunisian Vote, First of Arab Spring |first=David D. |last=Kirkpatrick |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/world/africa/tunisia-election-faces-financing-questions.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=22 October 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2011 interview, Al-Ghannushi said that the Palestinian problem lies at the heart of the Nation [umma], and that all the land between the mosque in Mecca and Jerusalem represents the heart of the Islamic Nation. He said that any [foreign] control over part of this heart is a stamp on the ummaâs illness and predicted that Israel will soon come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Muslim Brotherhood Claims Victory In Tunisia|url=http://globalmbreport.org/?p=5186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011|2011 Tunisian election]], Al-Ghannushi reached out to the [[Jews of Tunisia]], sending them delegations and gifts to Jewish nursing homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Islamist victory casts shadow over Tunisian Jews|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4139155,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
