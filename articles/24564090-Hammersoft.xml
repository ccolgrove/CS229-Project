'''''What Did I Do To Deserve This My Lord!? 2''''' (formerly known as '''''Holy Invasion Of Privacy, Badman! 2: Time To Tighten Up Security!''''', known as ''YÅ«sha no Kuse ni Namaiki da or2'', åèã®ããã«ãªã¾ããã or2, literally &quot;For a hero, [you are] quite impudent/cheeky/bold] or2)&quot; in Japan) is a [[real-time strategy]]/[[god game]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]], sequel to [[What Did I Do To Deserve This, My Lord?]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NArelease&quot; /&gt;  Its concept is the same as the first game's: creating mazes and monsters to defend Overlord Badman, a demon lord, from the heroes who try to slay him.

The game was released in Japan in 2008, and was announced for a North American release during [[Tokyo Game Show 2009]]. It is known that the game did not follow its predecessor's steps to be released exclusively for download on the [[PlayStation Store]], it was released on [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] format. This is supported by the fact that [[NIS America]] is looking into an UMD release of the first game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Badman1UMD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2009-09-30|title=NIS Re-Releasing PSP Titles, Plus Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! UMD Poll|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/09/nis-re-releasing-psp-titles-plus-holy-invasion-of-privacy-badman-umd-poll/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been delayed til May 4, 2010 for a North American release, due to the series western title being changed to avoid conflict with the ''[[Batman]]'' license.&lt;ref&gt;http://kotaku.com/5467932/holy-invasion-of-privacy-badman-forced-to-change-its-name-sequel-delayed&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay is the same as the first ''Holy Invasion Of Privacy, Badman!'' game's: Using a limited number of &quot;steps&quot; and a pickaxe, the player must dig and create a maze with monsters in it, to defend Overlord Badman from the heroes.

A [http://playstation.joystiq.com/2009/10/03/holy-invasion-of-privacy-badman-2-time-to-tighten-up-security/ trailer announcing the game's North American release] claims ''Holy Invasion Of Privacy, Badman! 2'' contains &quot;4 times more stages, 3.3 times more monsters and 2.3 times more heroes&quot; than the first game.

== Additions ==
While the game shares the first installment's gameplay, it also introduces additional features, exclusive to the sequel. These additions, shown by the trailer linked above, include '''Mutation''' (monsters can mutate in three forms: by deformity, by obesity and by gigantism) and '''The Overlord's Chamber''', where you can grow monsters and observe their evolution, aside from graphical changes. The UMD release includes the first game.
