'''Comcast Corporation''' ({{NASDAQ|CMCSA}} and {{NASDAQ|CMCSK}}) is the largest cable operator, home [[Internet service provider]], and fourth largest home telephone service provider in the United States, providing cable television, broadband Internet, and telephone service to both residential and commercial customers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncta.com/ContentView.aspx?contentId=73 |publisher=[[National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association]] |title=''Top 25 MSOs â As of March 2007''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isp-planet.com/research/rankings/usa.html |publisher=ISP Planet |title=Market Research â Top 23 U.S. ISPs by Subscriber: Q3 2007 |accessdate=March 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2008/tc20080220_751279.htm?chan=rss_topDiscussed_ssi_5 |work=BusinessWeek  |author=Olga Kharif |date=February 21, 2008 |title=''Say Hello To Unlimited Minutes''}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 39 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;annual_report&quot;&gt;[http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/CMCSA/845254023x0xS1193125%2D09%2D33975/1166691/filing.pdf Comcast 2008 Form 10-K], files.shareholder.com&lt;/ref&gt; 

The company is headquartered in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. Comcast also has significant holding in several cable networks (including E! Entertainment Television, Style Network, G4, The Golf Channel and Versus), distribution (ThePlatform), and related businesses. Comcast acquired a majority stake in media conglomerate [[NBCUniversal]] in January 2011. Comcast has received criticism from the media and customers for activities including the company's stance on net neutrality&lt;ref name=&quot;P2P-proposal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FCC-VOIP&quot;/&gt;, as well as poor results on customer satisfaction surveys.&lt;ref name = &quot;ReferenceName&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JDP-score&quot;/&gt;

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2009}}

Comcast Cable was originally formed as '''American Cable Systems''' in 1963&lt;ref&gt;[https://business.sos.state.ms.us/corp/soskb/Corp.asp?71302 Business.sos.state.ms.us] Business Corporation â Domestic â Information, Mississippi Secretary of State (Business Services), June 28, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; and was founded by [[Ralph J. Roberts]], Daniel Aaron, and Julian A. Brodsky based on a recommendation from [[Pete Musser]], who brought the deal to Ralph Roberts to buy his first cable system in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], Mississippi. The company was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1969, under the new name '''Comcast Corporation'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.corporations.state.pa.us/corp/soskb/Corp.asp?70658 Business Entity Filing History, Pennsylvania Department of State, March 5, 1969]. Corporations.state.pa.us. Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;Comcast&quot; is a [[portmanteau]] of the words &quot;Communication&quot; and &quot;Broadcast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2002/tc2002101_5035.htm Businessweek.com] Brian Roberts: High-Speed Pipes, [[Business Week]], October 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a number of years, Comcast became majority owner of [[Comcast Spectacor]], [[Comcast SportsNet]] (in [[Comcast SportsNet Chicago|Chicago]], [[Comcast Local|Michigan]], [[Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], [[Comcast SportsNet Mid-Atlantic|Washington DC/Baltimore]], [[Comcast SportsNet New England|New England]], [[Comcast SportsNet Bay Area|the San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Comcast SportsNet Northwest|the Pacific Northwest]] and metro [[Comcast SportsNet California|Sacramento]]), as well as [[E!|E! Entertainment Television]], [[Style Network]], [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]], [[The Golf Channel]] and [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] (formerly the Outdoor Life Network). In 2006, Comcast started a new sports channelâ[[SportsNet New York]]âin the greater New York City region, in partnership with the [[New York Mets]] and [[Time Warner Cable]].

Comcast also has a variety network known as [[Comcast Network]], available exclusively to Comcast and [[Cablevision]] subscribers. The channel shows news, sports, and entertainment and places emphasis in Philadelphia and the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. areas, though the channel is also available in New York, Pittsburgh, and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. In August 2004, Comcast started a channel called CET (Comcast Entertainment Television), available only to Colorado Comcast subscribers, and focusing on life in Colorado. It also carries some [[National Hockey League|National Hockey League (NHL)]] and [[National Basketball Association|National Basketball Association (NBA)]] games when Altitude Sports &amp; Entertainment is carrying the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] or [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. In January 2006, CET became the primary channel for Colorado's Emergency Alert System in the Denver Metro Area.

In 1996, Comcast launched Comcast Online to manage operations of their new product line revolving around broadband internet service. Comcast Cable purchased Sarasota Online, one of the largest Internet providers in Florida owned by entrepreneur [[Richard Swier]] and quickly expanded into over 30 cities. Today, Comcast Online has over 14&amp;nbsp;million Internet subscribers.

The UK division was sold to [[NTL Ireland|NTL]] in 1998. After the sale of their cellular division to [[AT&amp;T#SBC Communications|SBC Communications]] of [[San Antonio, TX|San Antonio]] and the acquisition of Greater Philadelphia Cablevision in 1999, Comcast and [[MediaOne]] announced a $60&amp;nbsp;billion [[mergers and acquisitions|merger]] which did not occur until three years later (as [[AT&amp;T Broadband]]). In addition, Comcast rebranded around that time and began to employ the logo that continues to be used to this day.

In 2002, Comcast paid the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] $25&amp;nbsp;million for [[naming rights]] to the new basketball arena built on the College Park campus, named [[Comcast Center (arena)|Comcast Center]].

On January 3, 2005, Comcast announced that it would become the anchor tenant in a new skyscraper in downtown Philadelphia, to be named the [[Comcast Center (office building)|Comcast Center]], not to be confused with the Maryland arena mentioned above. The {{convert|975|ft|m|abbr=on}} skyscraper is the tallest building in Pennsylvania.

In December 2005, Comcast announced the creation of [[Comcast Interactive Media]] (CIM), a new division focused on online media.

As of September 30, 2010, Comcast serves a total of 22.9&amp;nbsp;million cable customers, 16.7&amp;nbsp;million high-speed Internet customers, and 8.4&amp;nbsp;million voice customers. Comcast is headquartered in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, and also has corporate offices in [[Atlanta]], [[Detroit]], [[Denver]], and [[Manchester, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcast.com/corporate/about/pressroom/corporateoverview/corporateoverview.html Comcast Corporate Overview].

Comcast announced for the end of 2008 a new network congestion management technique, after receiving no complaints over the summer in five market trials which were held in [[Warrenton, Virginia]]; [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]]; [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]; [[Lake View, Florida]]; and [[East Orange, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Management Policy|url=http://www.comcast.net/terms/network/update/|publisher=Comcast Interactive Media|accessdate=October 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GE will also reserve the right to force the sale of their stake within the first seven years.

Additionally, the company is likely to push faster Internet bandwidth along with [[DOCSIS|DOCSIS 3.0]] cable modem service where available under the new branding.&lt;ref name=&quot;comcastblog&quot;&gt;Watson, David. &quot;[http://blog.comcast.com/2010/02/comcast-launches-xfinity.html Comcast Launches XFINITY]&quot;.

The Xfinity rebranding has been controversial since its introduction, said to be nothing more than an effort to sidestep the negativity of the &quot;Comcast&quot; brand name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0515328620100209 '&amp;#39;Comcast seeks reputation change with Xfinity brand'&amp;#39;, Yinka Adegoke, Reuters, February 9, 2010].

Comcast has 17.406&amp;nbsp;million high-speed internet customers as of March 30, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Q1 2011_results&quot;&gt;[http://www.cmcsk.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=574179 Comcast Reports 1st Quarter 2011 Results], cmcsk.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Comcast speed tiers
From lowest packages to highest 

-Economy internet service has speeds of 1.5mbps down and 0.34mbps up. This Internet speed uses a DOCIS 2.0 modem.

-Performance starter has speeds of 6mbps down and 1mbps up. This Internet speed used a DOCIS 2.0 modem. 

-Performance has been recently upgraded. The upgrade has taken effect in some areas as of August 1, 2011. The new speeds in DOCIS 3.0 areas are 20mbps down and 4mbps up with powerboost (former blast speeds). This uses a DOCIS 2.0 modem. But you can request for a DOCIS 3.0 modem. In some areas where this speed hasn't been upgraded, performance is still 15mbps down and 3mbps up with powerboost. 

-Blast Internet service has also been recently upgraded. This also has taken affect in some DOCIS 3.0 areas, as of August 1,2011. The new speeds are 30mbps down and 6mbps up. This uses a DOCIS 3.0 modem. In areas that haven't been recently upgrade, blast is still 20mbps down and 4mbps up, with powerboost.

-Ultra-grandfathered  (no longer available)

-Extreme 50 has speeds of 50mbps down and 15mbps up. This requires a DOCIS 3.0 modem to reach these speeds. 

-Extreme 105 has speeds of 105mbps down and 20mbps up. This requires a DOCIS 3.0 modem and premium installation.

-Extreme 50 and 105 doesn't have powerboost, as it was intended for performance and blast packages

====&quot;Excessive Use&quot; Policy====
Comcast broadband has a controversial 250-GB-per-month cap on downloads, which went into effect on October 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadbandreports.com/shownews/Comcast-250GB-Monthly-Cap-Goes-Live-October-1-97294 Comcast 250GB Cap Goes Live October 1]. Broadbandreports.com (2008-08-28). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy is also reflected in Comcast Network Management page. The cap combines both upload and download for the total limit. If a user exceeds the cap, on a first offense, a warning email and/or phone call will be issued with information on how to track bandwidth usage by suggesting software monitoring programs. On the second offense within the next six months, the customer's residential services are terminated for one year. The monitoring window is from the first to last day of each calendar month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.comcast.net/content/faq/Frequently-Asked-Questions-about-Excessive-Use Comcast.net Frequently Asked Questions about Excessive Use]. Help.comcast.net (2008-10-01). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comcast has a policy of terminating broadband customers who use &quot;excessive bandwidth&quot;, a term the company refused to define in its terms of service, which once said only that a customer's use should not &quot;represent (in the sole judgment of Comcast) an overly large burden on the network.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tos&quot; /&gt; Company responses to press inquiries suggest a limit of several hundred gigabytes per month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/personaltech/articles/2007/03/12/not_so_fast_broadband_providers_tell_big_users/ ''The Boston Globe'', ''Not so fast, broadband providers tell big users''] (No longer available)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/14/technology/14online.html?ex=1181188800&amp;en=06978ee1a8aa9cde&amp;ei=5070 ''The New York Times'', ''Say Good Night, Bandwidth Hog''] (Requires free registration)&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Comcast spokesman Charlie Douglas said the company defines &quot;excessive use&quot; as the equivalent of 30,000 songs, 250,000 pictures or 13 million emails in a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamedaily&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/comcast-clarifies-high-speed-extreme-use-policy/18014/ | title=Comcast Clarifies High Speed Extreme Use Policy, September 14, 2007 | accessdate=December 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other company statements have said the limit varied from month to month, depending on the capacity of specific cable nodes, and that it affected only the top one-thousandth of high-speed Internet customers.

====Features====
* According to the Comcast High Speed Internet [[terms of service]], residential customers are provided with dynamic [[IP address]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;tos&quot;&gt;[http://www.comcast.net/terms/use/ Comcast, '&amp;#39;Comcast High-Speed Internet Acceptable Use Policy'&amp;#39;].

* Comcast's &quot;PowerBoost&quot; delivers bursts for all but their highest-end and lowest-end tiers, allowing subscribers to use all excess cable node capacity to speed up the first few seconds of downloads.

====Legal Issues====
On September 4, 2008 Comcast sued the FCC over findings that the previous Network Management policy illegally interfered with [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] traffic on the Comcast network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6593047.html Comcast sues FCC over network management finding].

In addition to residential consumers, Comcast also serves businesses as customers, targeting both small businesses with fewer than 20 employees and also mid-sized businesses of 20-500 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/113495-Comcast_Speeds_Up_Business_High_Speed_Data_Offering.php Comcast Speeds Up Business High-Speed-Data Offering], Glen Dickson, [[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]], April 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, [[Minneapolis â Saint Paul]] became the first city in which Comcast Business Class offered 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s Internet service, which includes Microsoft Communication Services.&lt;ref&gt;

In May 2011, Comcast announced its Metro Ethernet services, which are available in 20 major U.S. markets, including Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Harrisburg (Pa.), Hartford, Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, state of New Jersey, Oakland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Washington D.C. and western New England. Comcast offers four types of Metro Ethernet services: Ethernet Private Line, Ethernet Virtual Private Line, Ethernet Network Service, and Ethernet Network Dedicated Access, that are available in speeds from one Megabit per second up to 10 Gigabits per second. 

Comcast Business services were initially sold exclusively through direct sales employees. On March 14, 2011, Comcast created an [[Sales outsourcing|indirect sales channel]] called the Solution Provider Program, a comprehensive indirect channel program that enables telecommunications consultants and [[system integrator]]s to sell Comcastâs services such as Business Class Internet, Voice, and high-capacity [[Fiber-optic communication|Ethernet]] services to small and mid-market businesses. The program offers recurring commissions for sales partners based on monthly revenue, and Comcast will provide, install, manage and bill for these services. For the initial launch of the Solutions Provider Program, Comcast enlisted three national master representatives â[[Telarus]], based in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], Intelisys, based in [[Petaluma, California]]; and Telecom Brokerage Inc (TBI), based in [[Chicago]]. Sub-agent sales partners must work with one of these three partners in the early stages of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=Khali|title=Comcast Launches Agent Program|url=http://www.channelpartnersonline.com/news/2011/03/comcast-launches-agent-program.aspx|accessdate=March 14, 2011|newspaper=Channel Partners|date=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The head of the Comcast Business channel is Craig Schlagbuam, former head of the [[Level 3 Communications]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=Khali|title=Comcast Taps Schlagbaum to Lead Channel|url=http://m.channelpartnersonline.com/20290/show/0d4e2b2fb4c6e55d70fd88eccf8e9ccf&amp;t=e97cf1c2b7d1bba002abad67057fe9b4|accessdate=January 19, 2011|newspaper=PHONE+|date=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programming===
Comcast not only delivers third-party programming content to its own customers, but also produces content that is delivered to both its subscribers and customers of other competing television services. This is a way to diversify Comcast's revenue to both sides of the content/delivery equation. Fully or partially owned Comcast programming includes Comcast Newsmakers, [[Comcast Network]], [[Comcast SportsNet]], [[SportsNet New York]], [[MLB Network]], [[Comcast Sports Southeast/Charter Sports Southeast]], [[E!|E! Entertainment]], [[Style Network]], [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]], [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]], [[The Golf Channel]], [[AZN Television]], and [[FEARnet]].

===Acquisitions and joint ventures===
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2009}}
{{See|List of assets owned by Comcast}}
Comcast bought 25% of Group W Cable in 1986, doubling its size. Two years later, it purchased a 50% share in Storer Communications, Inc. Comcast acquired American Cellular Network Corporation the same year before combining with Metrophone in 1990. Comcast became the third largest cable operator in 1994 following its purchase of [[Maclean-Hunter]]'s American division. Comcast owned the majority of the electronic retailer [[QVC]] from 1995 to 2004 when its share was sold to [[Liberty Media]]. Following other acquisitions, [[Microsoft]] invested $1&amp;nbsp;billion in Comcast in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1997/Jun97/ComcasPR.mspx Microsoft.com]. Microsoft.com (1997-06-09). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Comcast announced it would acquire the assets of the largest cable television operator at the time, [[AT&amp;T Broadband]] (AT&amp;T's spun-off cable TV service) for US$44.5&amp;nbsp;billion. In 2002, Comcast acquired all assets of AT&amp;T Broadband, thus making Comcast the largest cable television company in the United States with over 22 million subscribers. This also spurred the start of Comcast Advertising Sales (using AT&amp;T's groundwork) which would later be renamed [[Comcast Spotlight]]. As part of this acquisition, Comcast also acquired the National Digital Television Center in Centennial, [[Colorado]] as a wholly owned subsidiary, which is today known as the ''Comcast Media Center''.

[[File:AT&amp;T Comcast logo.svg|thumb|right|Proposed merger name logo, 2001]]
When it was first announced that AT&amp;T Broadband and Comcast were going to merge, the chosen name for the new company was &quot;AT&amp;T Comcast&quot;. That decision was changed so as to not confuse current and future investors in the company, and the merged company retained the Comcast name.

On February 11, 2004, Comcast surprised the media industry by announcing an unsolicited $66&amp;nbsp;billion bid for [[The Walt Disney Company]], a deal that would have made Comcast the largest [[media conglomerate]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=La |first=Paul R. |url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/02/11/news/companies/comcast_disney/ |title=Comcast makes $54B bid for Disney â Feb. 18, 2004 |publisher=CNN  |date=February 18, 2004 |accessdate=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rejection by Disney and uncertain response from investors, the bid was abandoned in April. The deal would have also required Comcast to sell off either the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] (which they own through [[Comcast Spectacor]]) or the Disney-owned [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]], since they wouldn't be permitted to own two [[National Hockey League|NHL]] teams. It was later discovered that the deal was mostly for Comcast to acquire one of Disney's most profitable operations, [[ESPN]], in an attempt to expand its sports reach. Comcast has since opted to rename OLN as Versus and expand their sports coverage with the [[Tour de France]] and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]. Comcast's NHL deal also obligated them to launch a U.S. version of [[NHL Network (United States)|NHL Network]] by the summer of 2007. The network finally launched in October 2007. Disney later sold the now-Anaheim Ducks to [[Henry Samueli]] in 2005 in an unrelated transaction.

Comcast announced on March 25, 2004 that its new gaming-oriented television network [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]] (operated by subsidiary G4 Media, Inc.) would acquire [[Vulcan Inc.|Vulcan Venture]]'s technology-oriented television network [[TechTV]]. The deal was finalized on May 10, 2004 â and the two networks became [[G4techTV]] on May 28, 2004. On January 11, 2005, Comcast announced that it would drop TechTV from the station's name and again be known as &quot;G4&quot;.

On April 8, 2005, a partnership led by Comcast and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] finalized a deal to acquire [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and its affiliate studio, [[United Artists]], and create an additional outlet to carry MGM/UA's material for cable and Internet distribution.

On October 31, 2005, Comcast officially announced that it had acquired [[Susquehanna Communications]] (SusCom,) a [[York, Pennsylvania|York, PA]]-based cable television and broadband services provider and unit of the former [[Susquehanna Pfaltzgraff]] company, for a net cash investment of approximately $540&amp;nbsp;million. In this deal Comcast acquired approximately 230,000 basic cable customers, 71,000 digital cable customers, and 86,000 high-speed Internet customers. Comcast previously owned approximately 30 percent of Susquehanna Communications.

On April 3, 2007, Comcast announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire the cable systems owned and operated by [[Patriot Media]], a privately held company owned by cable veteran Steven J. Simmons, [[Spectrum Equity Investors]] and Spire Capital, that serves approximately 81,000 video subscribers. Comcast will acquire Patriot for a net cash investment of approximately $483&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comcast.com/About/PressRelease/PressReleaseDetail.ashx?PRID=3 Comcast Corporation To Acquire Patriot Media].

====Adelphia purchase====
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2009}}
In April 2005, Comcast and Time Warner Cable announced plans to buy [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia Cable]]. $17.6&amp;nbsp;billion was to be paid (partly in stock) in the deal that was finalized in the second quarter of 2006âafter the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] completed a seven-month investigation without raising an objection. [[Time Warner Cable]] would become the second largest cable provider in the U.S., ranking behind Comcast. As part of the same deal, Time Warner and Comcast would also trade existing subscribers to create larger clusters of customers for each company in various geographical areas.{{Citation needed|reason=October, 2007|date=October 2007}}. As a part of this subscriber exchange, Comcast and Time Warner transferred contracts for multiple dwelling units. For Comcast, analysis of these contracts were conducted by GAMI LLC [http://gamillc.com/], an IT enabled BPO 2.0 (Business Process Outsourcing) firm in Philadelphia western suburbs.

The changes became effective on August 1, 2006. As an example, Comcast's systems in the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]] were traded to TWC in exchange for Time Warner's North [[Louisiana]] market, which covers [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]] and [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]]. Also, Comcast in Los Angeles Area was traded with TWC. Parts of the Orange County area ([[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]], [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], etc.) that were Adelphia were originally Comcast subscribers until the early 2000s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Also in August 2006, Comcast and Time Warner dissolved a partnership that controlled the systems in the [[Houston]], Southwest Texas, [[San Antonio]], and [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]] markets. After the dissolution, Comcast obtained the Houston system, and Time Warner retained the others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070926235353/http://www.timewarnercable.com/InvestorRelations/PressReleases/TWCPressReleaseDivDetail.ashx?PRID=1223&amp;MarketID=19 Time Warner Cable, '&amp;#39;Time Warner Cable/Comcast Official Statement'&amp;#39;]. Web.archive.org (2007-09-26). Retrieved on July 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2007, Comcast officially took control of the Houston system, but continued to operate under the Time Warner Cable brand in the interim. As of June 19, 2007, the Time Warner name was officially retired and replaced by Comcast.

Comcast also took over Adelphia systems in the [[State College, Pennsylvania]] area in addition to the [[Lewistown, Pennsylvania]] area. The company also took over Adelphia's systems in the [[Pittsburgh]] market, combining those systems with Comcast's already-large market share in the region (Comcast entered [[Pittsburgh]] through the AT&amp;T Broadband deal). Aside from the [[satellite television|satellite]] companies and small areas with [[Armstrong Group of Companies|Armstrong Cable]] (and more recently [[Verizon FiOS]]), Comcast effectively has a monopoly in the [[Pittsburgh]] region.

In early 2007, Comcast took over Adelphia operations in Palm Beach, Broward, Hillsborough, and Miami-Dade Counties in Florida and Bartow, Pickens, Cherokee, and Forsyth Counties in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2005/12/12/daily37.html | first=Peter | last=Key | title=Comcast adjusts to accommodate Adelphia deal | date=December 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====thePlatform purchase====
In July 2006, Comcast purchased the Seattle-based software company [[thePlatform]]. This represented an entry into a new line of business â selling software to allow companies to manage their Internet (and IP-based) media publishing efforts. Customers of thePlatform include [[Verizon Wireless]], [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], [[CNBC]], [[CBS College Sports]], and [[HiT Entertainment]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theplatform.com/corp/solutions/ |title= thePlatform Solutions |accessdate=August 1, 2008 |publisher=thePlatform}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; thePlatform also provides media access for Hulu and XfinityTV.com (formerly Fancast.com).

====Plaxo purchase====
In May 2008 Comcast purchased [[Plaxo]] for a reported $150&amp;nbsp;million to $170&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farber |first=Dan |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13953_3-9944352-80.html |title=Comcast goes social with Plaxo acquisition &amp;#124; Outside the Lines â CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=May 14, 2008 |accessdate=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ESPNU and ESPN3.com ====
{{Ref improve section|date=December 2009}}
On May 19, 2009, Disney and ESPN Media Networks and Comcast Corporation announced an agreement to add ESPNU to its Digital Classic level of service.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnmediazone.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2009_05_may/20090519_COMCASTADDSESPNUANDESPN360.COMTOLINEUPWITHCONTENT.htm &quot;Comcast adds ESPNU and ESPN360.COM to line up with content on television, on demand and online&quot;]. espnmediazone.com, Comcast press release, May 19, 2009. Accessed October 12, 2009.{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast added ESPNU to a majority of its cable systems in time for the start of the 2009 college football season. This includes Comcast's southern systems which enjoys coverage of ESPNU's new Saturday game-of-the-week Southeastern Conference (SEC) package. With this agreement, ESPNU has more than 46 million subscribers.

In the same agreement, it was announced that ESPN360.com (now ESPN3.com)âthe sports company's U.S. live sports broadband networkâwould be made available to all Comcast high speed Internet subscribers. ESPN3.com provides live streaming of more than 3,500 sports events from around the world annually. Programming includes major soccer leagues, US college football, basketball, baseball and softball, NBA, MLB, coverage of major golf and tennis tournaments (such as tennis &quot;grand slam&quot; events, the US Open and Wimbledon). With the agreement ESPN360.com became available to nearly 41&amp;nbsp;million homes, a majority of broadband homes in America.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnmediazone.com&quot;/&gt;

====TechTV acquisition====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
On March 25, 2004, Comcast's G4 gaming channel announced a merger with TechTV. This move became hugely controversial among loyal fans of TechTV and its well known personality [[Leo Laporte]]. Around May 6, G4 announced the termination of 250 employees from the San Francisco office by July 10, 2004, allowing approximately 80 to 100 employees to transition to G4's main office in Los Angeles, California if they agreed to relocate there.

On May 10, 2004, G4 Media completed the acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan. G4techTV was launched in the U.S. and Canada on May 28, 2004. This led to the cancellation of many of the TechTV channels throughout carriers across the world. On January 3, 2005, TechTV International began airing select programs from G4techTV.

On February 15, 2005, the TechTV brand was dropped from the United States G4techTV feed, leaving the network name as G4 â Video Game Television; since then, G4 has gone through a rebranding into a male oriented network. Comcast also acquired 33.33% of [[G4 Canada]] in addition to its US channel in the sale of TechTV.

====U.S. Olympic Network====
The [[United States Olympic Committee|U.S. Olympic Committee]] and Comcast intended to team up to create The U.S. Olympic Network, which was slated to launch after the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/cable-tv/e3i607dcf03868690e2ffdb96972d3af291 Comcast, U.S. Olympic Committee to Launch Cable Net], ''Mediaweek'', July 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; These plans have since been put on hold by the U.S. Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/esearch/e3i96d4521eedf15d13562906040c0c845b U.S. Olympic Cable Network Put on Hold], ''Mediaweek'', August 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Olympic Committee and Comcast have ended the plans to create The U.S. Olympic Network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/22/sports/olympics/22channel.html U.S.O.C.

====NBCUniversal====

[[Image:NBCUNI Logo.png|200px|right]]
Media outlets began reporting in late September 2009 that Comcast was in talks to buy [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]]. Comcast denied the rumors at first, while NBC would not comment on them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/business/media-reports-comcast-in-151625.html Comcast in Talks to Buy NBC Universal], ''AJC.com'', October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, CNBC itself reported on October 1 that [[General Electric]] was considering spinning NBCUniversal off into a separate company that would merge the [[NBC]] television network and its cable properties such as [[USA Network]], [[Syfy]] and [[MSNBC]] with Comcast's content assets. GE would maintain 49% control of the new company, while Comcast owned 51%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnbc.com/id/33123120 GE is in Talks to Spin Off NBC, Give Comcast 51% of New Unit], ''CNBC.com'', October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/ge-and-comcast-exploring-a-spin-off-of-nbc-universal GE and Comcast Exploring a Spin-Off of NBC Universal], ''The New York Times'', October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivendi]], which owns 20%, would have to sell its stake to GE.

On November 1, 2009, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported Comcast had moved closer to a deal to purchase [[NBCUniversal]] and that a formal announcement could be made sometime the following week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/business/media/02nbc.html Comcast Said to Be Close to Gaining NBC Universal], ''The New York Times'', November 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, 2009, the parties announced that Comcast will take a controlling 51% stake in NBCUniversal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/12/03/news/companies/comcast_nbc/index.htm|title=GE, Comcast announce joint NBC deal|last=Goldman|first=David|date=December 3, 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=December 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2011, the FCC approved the deal by a vote of 4 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/f-c-c-approves-comcast-nbc-deal Government Approves Comcast-NBC Deal], ''New York Times'', January 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was completed on January 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031139?refcatid=14 Comcast, NBC U Merger a Done Deal], ''Variety'', January 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewrap.com/television/column-post/comcast-nbcu-deal-closes-24288 Comcast-NBCU Deal Done: $30B Later, Comcast Is Proud Owner of the Peacock], ''The Wrap'', January 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=12792681 Comcast Takes Over NBC Universal After Long Review], ''ABC News'', January 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial performance==
The book value of the company nearly doubled from $8.19 a share in 1999 to $15 a share in 2009. Revenues grew sixfold from 1999's $6&amp;nbsp;billion to almost $36&amp;nbsp;billion in 2009. Net profit margin rose from 4.2% in 1999 to 8.4% in 2009, with operating margins improving 31 percent and return on equity doubling to 6.7 percent in the same time span. Between 1999 and 2009, return on capital nearly tripled to 7 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.sj-r.com/business/x1992007274/Malcom-Berko-Taking-stock Malcolm Berko: Taking stock], ''[[The State Journal-Register]]'', October 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employee relations==
Comcast is consistently rated highly in &quot;top places to work&quot; lists. It should be noted, however, that this status applies only to employees who work directly for Comcast and does not apply to contracted employees in their various third-party call centers. In 2009, it was listed in CableFAX magazine's &quot;Top 10 Places to Work in Cable&quot;, which cited its &quot;scale, savvy and vision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cablefax.com/programming/networks/2009-Top-10-Places-to-Work-in-Cable_38104.html 2009 Top 10 Places to Work in Cable], CableFAX, October 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the ''[[Philadelphia Business Journal]]'' awarded Comcast the silver medal among extra-large companies in Philadelphia, with the gold medal going to partner organization, Comcast-Spectacor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2009/10/19/focus3.html Silver Winner|Extra-Large Company Comcast Corp.], [[Philadelphia Business Journal]], October 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philadelphia.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2009/10/19/focus2.html?q=%20best%20places%20to%20work%20%20philadelphia%20comcast Gold Winner|Extra-Large Company: Comcast-Spectacor], [[Philadelphia Business Journal]], October 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' found Comcast to be that city's top place to work in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/jobs/topworkplaces/2009/articles/a_cable_company_that_listens/ A cable company that listens], [[The Boston Globe]], November 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employee diversity is also an attribute upon which Comcast receives strong marks. In 2008, ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine rated Comcast among the top 15 companies for workforce diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackenterprise.com/diversity/diversity-lists/2008/07/10/the-15-best-companies-for-workforce-diversity-2 The 15 Best Companies for Workforce Diversity], [[Black Enterprise]], July 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFL Network===
On November 10, 2006 Comcast announced it would add [[NFL Network]] on digital tiers in time for the eight-game Thursday- and Saturday-night package.&lt;ref name=&quot;MultiC&quot;&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6390422.html Cox Adds NFL Network Game Package] Multichannel&lt;/ref&gt; On August 6, 2007 Comcast moved NFL Network from the digital tiers to the ''Sports Entertainment Package''. This led to a court
battle between NFL Network and Comcast, with the ruling in favor of Comcast but the NFL Network plans to appeal the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabuyerplanner.com/2007/05/11/nfl-network-to-appeal-court-ruling-for-comcast/ NFL Network to Appeal Court Ruling for Comcast] Media Buyer Planner&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast has sent NFL Network a [[cease-and-desist]] letter to stop encouraging subscribers to leave Comcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;USACom&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-11-20-comcast-letter_N.htm?csp=34 Comcast sends NFL Network cease-and-desist note] Media Buyer Planner&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast's agreement with the NFL Network ends in mid-2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;MultiCom&quot;&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6501908.html Jones: Comcastâs NFL Network Deal Expires In 18 Months] Multichannel&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2008 an appellate court in New York has reversed field on a judgment made in May 2007 that allowed Comcast to move the network from its second most distributed tier to the company's sports tier. At the time a court date has not been set. Four judges at New Yorkâs Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, ruled the language &quot;concerning ''additional programming package'' was ambiguous and that ''neither party has established that its interpretation of the relevant contracts is a matter of law.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SportsTier2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6535634.html |title= Court Reverses Field On Comcastâs NFL Network Tier Play |accessdate=February 27, 2008 |date= February 26, 2008 |last= Reynolds |first= Mike |publisher=[http://multichannel.com/ Multichannel News] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFL Network later filed a discrimination case against Comcast with the FCC, claiming that since Comcast doesn't charge extra for its owned and operated sports channels [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]] and [[The Golf Channel]], it's unfair to charge extra for NFL Network. On October 10, 2008, the FCC ruled as follows:

&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;In the Second Report and Order, the Commission emphasized that the statute âdoes not explicitly prohibit multichannel distributors from acquiring a financial interest or exclusive rights that are otherwise permissible,â and thus, that âmultichannel distributors [may] negotiate for, but not insist upon such benefits in exchange for carriage on their systems.â The Commission stated, however, that âultimatums, intimidation, conduct that amounts to exertion of pressure beyond good faith negotiations, or behavior that is tantamount to an unreasonable refusal to deal with a vendor who refuses to grant financial interests or exclusivity rights for carriage, should be considered examples of behavior that violates the prohibitions set forth in Section 616.âWe find that the NFL has presented sufficient evidence to make a prima facie showing that Comcast indirectly and improperly demanded a financial interest in the NFLâs programming in exchange for carriage. We further find that the pleadings and documentation present several factual disputes as to whether Comcastâs retiring of the NFL Network is the result of Comcastâs failure to obtain a financial interest in the NFLâs programming. Accordingly, we direct an Administrative Law Judge to hold a hearing, issue a recommended decision on the facts underlying the financial interest claim and a recommended remedy, if necessary, and then return the matter to the Commission within 60 days.&lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6604711.html FCC: Programmers make case for discrimination].

====FCC program access complaint====
Comcast's trial about the NFL Network's program access complaint with the FCC, filed in May 2008, before an administrative law judge began on April 14, 2009. At issue is whether Comcast's placement of the NFL Network on a digital sports tier (&quot;Sports Entertainment Package&quot;) represents discrimination prevented by the 1992 Cable Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/196111-NFL_Network_s_FCC_Program_Access_Complaint_Against_Comcast_Kicks_Off_Tuesday.php Multichannel News April 13, 2009 NFL Network's FCC Program-Access Complaint Against Comcast Kicks Off Tuesday â ALJ Will Hear Network's Case Against Operator; Other Huddles To Follow].

On April 17, 2009, Comcast chairman and CEO Brian Roberts testified that Comcast is willing to move the channel from the Sports Entertainment Package to a lower priced base package if the subscriber fee was reduced to 25 cents per month. NFL Network currently charges a 75Â¢  per month fee.

===Low customer satisfaction levels===
[[Image:Comcast service van.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Comcast service van, [[Ypsilanti Township, Michigan]]]]
In 2004 and 2007, the [[American Customer Satisfaction Index]] survey found that Comcast had the worst customer satisfaction rating of any company or government agency in the country, including the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. However, the ACSI indicates that almost half of [[Baseline|all cable customers (regardless of company)]] have registered complaints, and that cable is the only industry to score below 60 in the ACSI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=86&amp;Itemid=90 The American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''First Quarter, 2004'']{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comcast's Customer Service Rating by the ACSI surveys indicate that the company's customer service has not improved since the surveys began in 2001. Analysis of the surveys states that &quot;Comcast is one of the lowest scoring companies in ACSI. As its customer satisfaction eroded by 7% over the past year, revenue increased by 12%.&quot; The ACSI analysis also addresses this contradiction, stating that &quot;Such [[pricing power]] usually comes with some level of monopoly protection and most cable companies have little competition at the local level. This also means that a cable company can do well financially even though its customers are not particularly satisfied.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=169&amp;Itemid=168 American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''First Quarter, 2007'']{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=157&amp;c=Comcast+Corporation&amp;i=Cable+%26+Satellite+TV American Customer Satisfaction Index, ''Scores By Company: Comcast Corporation'']{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 Comcast rebounded on its ACSI rating for television and Internet services, moving ahead of [[Charter Communications]] and into a tie with [[Time Warner Cable]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theacsi.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=157&amp;c=Comcast&amp;i=Cable+%26+Satellite+TV Scores By Company â Comcast], [[American Customer Satisfaction Index|ACSI]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;A majority of the respondents were satisfied with the friendliness and courtesy of customer service personnel. Overall, approximately 43% of the respondents rated the cable company's performance as fair, 30% regarded it as poor and another 30% rated the cable company's performance as good.&quot;

While Comcast does operate some of its own Customer Service Call centers it also outsources Customer Service and some technical support to [[Convergys]] Inc and until recently [[Transcom WorldWide]], both third party call center companies.

On October 1, 2008, J.D. Power and Associates published its annual customer satisfaction survey for the nation's top 10 largest cable and satellite television providers. Comcast scored in the bottom 5 for each region of the United States, including 10th in the East Region.&lt;ref name=&quot;JDP-score&quot;&gt;[http://news.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/10381/518826.html J.D.

====Customer service after Hurricane Ike====
Shortly after [[Hurricane Ike]] hit the [[Houston, Texas]] area in 2008, customers received bills and later collection notices for unreturned equipment that was destroyed during the storm. One customer reported a $931 bill which included a $66 credit for interrupted phone service, but also included $1000 charge for not returning her rented [[Digital video recorder|DVR]], [[Cable Modem]], and other equipment. Comcast responses differed after the storm, with some Customer Care agents telling customers to file with their insurance providers, and other agents advising customers to return their equipment, even if it was ruined or moldy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6460278 |title=Comcast customer gets $931 bill after Hurricane Ike - 10/22/08 - Houston News |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=October 22, 2008 |accessdate=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Network neutrality===
{{See|Network neutrality}}
As early as late 2006, Comcast has implemented measures using [[Sandvine]] hardware which sends forged [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP RST]] (reset) packets, disrupting multiple protocols used by [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r18323368-Comcast-is-using-Sandvine-to-manage-P2P-Connections DSLReports, ''Comcast is using [[Sandvine]] to manage [[Peer-to-peer|P2P]] Connections'']&lt;/ref&gt;  This has prevented most Comcast users from uploading files.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/comcast-throttles-bittorrent-traffic-seeding-impossible/ TorrentFreak, '&amp;#39;Comcast Throttles BitTorrent Traffic, Seeding Impossible'&amp;#39;].

There is also evidence of Comcast using RST packets on groupware applications that have nothing to do with file sharing.

There is a current ongoing dispute about access to Netflix from inside the Comcast network.
&quot;On November 19, 2010, Comcast informed [[Level 3 Communications|Level 3]] that, for the first time, it will demand a recurring fee from Level 3 for additional bandwidth, to keep up with unprecedented customer demand, to transmit Internet online movies and other content to Comcast's customers who request such content, in order to cover infrastructure costs.&quot; Level 3 asked Comcast for an additional 200 Gbit/s access to their network at no additional cost, that would offset the long-standing contract between the two companies that as long as each uses roughly the same amount of bandwidth of each others services, that neither would be charged.

===DNS Redirection===
Comcast turns on [[ISP redirect page|DNS redirection]] option for its paying cable broadband customers by default. When customers accidentally type and enter a non-existent Web address they are redirected to the Comcast search screen. Comcast calls this option &quot;Domain Helper&quot; and gives customers an option to disable it, after authentication on their Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dns-opt-out.comcast.net/help-index.php |title=Comcast customerCentral Opt-Out Help |publisher=Dns-opt-out.comcast.net |accessdate=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
