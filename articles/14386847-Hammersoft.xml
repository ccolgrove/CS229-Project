'''Benque Viejo del Carmen United''' is a [[Belize]]an [[football (soccer)|football]] team which currently competes in the [[Belize Premier Football League]].  The Team is based in the western town of [[Benque Viejo del Carmen]].  Their home stadium is [[Edmund Marshalleck Stadium]].

==History==
The team was founded in July, 2004 as Benque Viejo Del Carmen UNITED and has not been affiliated to Benque FC which played in the Cayo First Division. During the 2005-06 season, Benque DC UNITED competed in the RFG Insurance Cup. In 2008 Benque D.C. United played in the [[Super League of Belize]], in the [[semi-professional]] Division placing first in the inaugural marathon and second in the tournament finals. This team was the brain child and effort of one town resident who choses to remain anonymous. Currently this team is reorganizing with young players and is known as DC YOUTH. Plans are to compete in the Super League of Belize in the very near future.
