is a major [[France|French]] [[video game publisher]] and [[video game developer|developer]], with headquarters in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], [[France]]. The company has a worldwide presence with 25 studios in 17 countries and subsidiaries in 26 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;glance&quot;/&gt;

As of November 2011, it is the third largest independent game publisher in [[Europe]], and the third largest in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;glance&quot;/&gt; The company's largest development studio is [[Ubisoft Montreal]], which in 2011 employed approximately 1,700 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/5271091065/m/1011089217?r=6521089217#6521089217 Questions about Ubisoft Montreal - Topic Powered by eve community]&lt;/ref&gt; Yves Guillemot, a founding brother, was the chairman and [[chief executive officer|CEO]]. As for 2008â2009, Ubisoft's revenue was â¬1.058 billion, reaching the 1 billion [[euro]] milestone for the first time in its history. Ubisoft has created its own film division called Ubisoft Motion Pictures which will create shows and films based on its games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffin|first=McElroy|title=Ubisoft launching film studio focused on game adaptations|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/05/02/ubisoft-launching-film-studio-focused-on-game-adaptations/|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The five brothers of the Guillemot family founded Ubisoft as a computer game publisher in March [[1986 in video gaming|1986]] in [[France]] ([[Brittany]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atarimagazines.com/startv3n8/games_games.html &quot;Games, Games and More Games&quot;] article from ''Start'' magazine volume 3 issue 8, March 1989; retrieved from Atarimagazines.com&lt;/ref&gt; Yves Guillemot soon made deals with [[Electronic Arts]], [[Sierra On-Line]], and [[MicroProse]] to distribute their games in France. By the end of the decade, Ubisoft began expanding to other markets, including the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/index.php?p=66&amp;art_id=| title=History| publisher=Ubisoft| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990 years, Ubisoft initiated its in-house game development program which led to the 1994 opening of a studio in [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]], France, which later became their headquarters. Ubisoft became a publicly traded company in 1996 and continued to expand to offices around the globe, opening locations in [[Shanghai]] and [[Montreal]].

In 2000, Ubisoft acquired [[Red Storm Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bluesnews.com/a/60| title=Ubi Soft Acquires Red Storm Entertainment| publisher=Blue's News| date=2000-08-29| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, they acquired [[DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany]] based [[Blue Byte Software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2683947.html| title=Ubi Soft acquires Blue Byte Software| first=Jennifer| last=Ho| publisher=Gamespot| date=2001-02-09| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, Gores Technology Group sold [[The Learning Company]]'s entertainment division (which includes games originally published by [[BrÃ¸derbund Software]], [[Mattel]], [[Mindscape]] and [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.]]) to them. The sale included the rights to [[Intellectual property|IP]]s such as the [[Myst]] and [[Prince of Persia]] series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/03_07_01_11_45AM.htm| title=Ubi Soft Acquires The Learning Company's Entertainment Division| publisher=GameZone| date=2001-03-07| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, they acquired Gamebusters and moved them to the German Offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobygames&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mobygames.com/company/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/history| title=History for Ubisoft Entertainment SA| publisher=MobyGames| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ubisoft committed itself to online games by getting behind ''[[Uru: Ages Beyond Myst]]'', ''[[The Matrix Online]]'', and the [[Europe]]an and [[China|Chinese]] operation of ''[[EverQuest]]''. The publisher established ubi.com as its online division. However, in February 2004, Ubisoft cancelled the online portion of ''Uru'' and backed out of the publishing deal on ''The Matrix Online''. Nevertheless, a mere week later, the company announced its acquisition of [[Wolfpack Studios]], developer of ''[[Shadowbane]]''.

In December 2004, a rival game corporation [[Electronic Arts]] purchased a 19.9% stake in the firm, an action Ubisoft referred to as &quot;hostile&quot; on EA's part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Curt |last=Feldman |title=Electronic Arts buys stake in Ubisoft in &quot;hostile&quot; act |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6115370.html |publisher=[[Gamespot]] |date=2004-12-20 |accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005, Ubisoft acquired part of [[MC2-MicroÃ¯ds]] (''MicroÃ¯ds Canada'') and integrated it into [[Ubisoft Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ubi.com/ENCA/News/Info.aspx?nId=2028 |title=Ubisoft Montreal enters into an agreement to acquire Microids Canada's development operations |publisher=Ubisoft |date=2005-03-02 |accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006 Ubisoft also bought the ''[[Driver (series)|Driver]]'' franchise from [[Atari]] for a sum of â¬19 million (USD$24 million) in cash for the franchise, technology rights, and most asset. Additionally, though Ubisoft is not acquiring the studio outright, the members of ''Driver'' developer Reflections Interactive became employees of Ubisoft. As a result, Reflections Interactive was subsequently renamed [[Ubisoft Reflections]].

On 11 April 2007, Ubisoft announced that it had acquired German game developer [[Sunflowers Interactive Entertainment Software|Sunflowers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ubisoft Acquires SunFlowers, Anno Franchise |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13483 |publisher=Gamasutra |date=11 April 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an acquisition of [[Japan]]ese developer Digital Kids that November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ubisoft Buys Japanese Studio |url=http://www.gametab.com/news/1096915/ |publisher=GameTab |date=2007-11-05 |accessdate=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubisoft is also responsible for publishing famous franchises produced by other important studios for some specific platforms, such as ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' for [[Personal computer|PC]], which is a [[Capcom]] production, and ''[[Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon]]'' for [[PlayStation 2]] and ''Harvest Moon Online'', which are [[Marvelous Interactive]] productions.

On 8 July 2008, Ubisoft made the acquisition of [http://www.hybride.com/ Hybride Technologies], a Montreal-based studio renowned for its expertise in the creation of visual effects for cinema, television and advertising. Created over 15 years ago, Hybride employs 100 team members. The studioâs many projects include such innovative films as ''300'', ''Frank Millerâs Sin City'', ''Avatar'' and the ''Spy Kids'' series.

On 10 November 2008, Ubisoft acquired [[Massive Entertainment]] from [[Activision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release| url=http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/index.php?p=59&amp;art_id=60&amp;vars=Y29tX2lkPTU5OCZzZW5kZXI9SE9NRSZzZW5kZXJfdXJsPWluZGV4LnBocCUzRnNpdF9pZCUzRDImZmlsdGVyX3R5cGU9JmZpbHRlcl9tb250aD0mZmlsdGVyX3llYXI9&amp;PHPSESSID=a43273f204f3657c74e1b50bf4668202| title=Ubisoft acquires the assets of Massive Entertainment |publisher=Ubisoft| date=2008-11-10| accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Ubisoft Motion Tracking Camera}}

In 2009 Ubisoft released the [[Ubisoft Motion Tracking Camera]] for the [[Wii]] that detects the movement of the gamer to play games like ''[[Your Shape]]'' and ''Racquet Sports''. This technology was created by Ubisoft Barcelona, Spain.

==Controversies==
Ubisoft had, for a time, used the controversial [[StarForce]] copy protection technology that installs drivers on a system and is known to cause some hardware problems and compatibility issues with certain operating systems{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, starting with the game ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory]]'', which was not compatible with [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] for quite some time, until a patch was released by the makers of StarForce.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} On 14 April 2006, Ubisoft confirmed that they would stop using StarForce on their games, citing complaints from customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6147655.html| title=Ubisoft officially dumps Starforce| first=Tor| last=Thorsen| publisher=Gamespot| date=2006-04-14| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the February 2008 issue of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly|Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM)]]'', Editor-in-Chief Dan âShoeâ Hsu asserted that Ubisoft had ceased to provide all Ubisoft titles to the ''EGM'' for any coverage purposes as a result of prior critical previews and negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kotaku.com/342519/3-companies-bar-egm-from-coverage-following-poor-reviews| title=3 Companies Bar EGM From Coverage Following Poor Reviews| first=Luke| last=Plunkett| publisher=Kotaku| date=2008-01-08| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8568051&amp;publicUserId=5379799| title=Banned| first=Dan| last=Hsu| publisher=[[1UP.com]]| date=2008-01-09| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yves Guillemot, the CEO of Ubisoft, was quoted in the company's third-quarter 2008-09 sales report as saying &quot;''as some of our games did not meet the required quality levels to achieve their full potential, they need more sales promotions than anticipated''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.euronext.com/fic/000/043/570/435703.pdf| title=Ubisoft 3rd-quarter 2008-09 sales report| publisher=Ubisoft| format=PDF| date=2009-01-22| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Ubisoft has announced the ''Online Services Platform'', which forces customers to not only authenticate on the first game launch, but to remain online continually while playing, with the game even pausing if network connection is lost. This makes it impossible to play the game offline, to resell it, and means that should Ubisoft's servers go down, the game will be unplayable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://support.uk.ubi.com/online-services-platform/| title=Online Services Platform Q&amp;A| publisher=Ubisoft| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, review versions of ''Assassin's Creed II'' and ''Settlers 7'' for PC contained this new DRM scheme, confirming that it is already in use, and that instead of pausing the game, it would discard all progress since the last checkpoint or save game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=235290&amp;site=pcg| title=Constant net connection required to play Assassin's Creed 2 on PC| first=Tom| last=Francis| publisher=PC Gamer| date=2010-02-17| accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent patches for ''Assassin's Creed II'' allow the player to continue playing once their connection has been restored without lost progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/ubisoft-assassin-s-creed-drm-protection,9807.html| title=Ubisoft Patch Makes its Internet DRM Less Painful| first=Marcus| last=Yam| publisher=Tom's Hardware| date=March 5, 2010| accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2010 outages to the Ubisoft DRM servers were reported, causing about 5% of legitimate buyers to be unable to play ''Assassin's Creed II'' and ''Silent Hunter 5'' games.&lt;ref name=&quot;escapistmagazine.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/98935-Ubisoft-Blames-DRM-Outage-on-Server-Attack | title=Ubisoft Blames DRM Outage on &quot;Server Attack&quot; | publisher=Escapistmagazine.com | date=2010-03-08 | accessdate=2010-11-11 | author=Andy Chalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UbisoftAttack&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/ubisoft-drm-was-attacked-at-weekend |title=Ubisoft DRM was &quot;attacked&quot; at weekend |publisher=[[EuroGamer]] |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=08-03-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft initially said this was the result of the number of users attempting to access their servers to play, however Ubisoft later claimed that the real cause of the outages were [[denial-of-service attack]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;escapistmagazine.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UbisoftAttack&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/10184920360| title=Ubisoft's official Twitter post regarding attacks.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's use of Aaron Priceman, also known as ''Mr. Caffeine'', as a spokesman at [[E3 2011]] was criticized for its reliance on witty remarks, inability to pronounce Tom Clancy (he pronounced it Tom Culancy), sexual innuendos and imitations of video game sound effects with little to no response from the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterling|first=Jim|title=Are publishers doing E3 badly on purpose?|url=http://www.destructoid.com/are-publishers-doing-e3-badly-on-purpose--203746.phtml|publisher=Destructoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Ubisoft released From Dust with DRM protection, contrary to previous statements that the game would not have any DRM related restrictions. Though a promise was made to remove it, after several months the DRM had still not been removed from many if not all copies of the game. Also, the game was widely described as &quot;badly ported&quot; from consoles. Joystiq reports that &quot;paying players will find a capped frame rate, limited resolutions for the windowed mode, no anti-aliasing and plenty of bugs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref_joystiq&quot;/&gt;

On 23rd of November the creative director of Ubisoft's 'I am Alive' Stanislas Mettra stated &quot;We've heard loud and clear that PC gamers are bitching about there being no version for them,&quot; said Mettra. &quot;But are these people just making noise just because there's no version or because it's a game they actually want to play? Would they buy it if we made it?&quot;.  Mr Mettra also added &quot;Itâs hard because thereâs so much piracy and so few people are paying for PC games that we have to precisely weigh it up against the cost of making it. Perhaps it will only take 12 guys three months to port the game to PC. Itâs not a massive cost but itâs still a cost. If only 50,000 people buy the game, then itâs not worth it.&quot;  The statements made by Mettra are fast becoming notorious.

==Lawsuits==
In 2008, Ubisoft sued Optical Experts Manufacturing (OEM), a DVD Duplication company for $25 million plus damages for the leak and distribution of the PC version of ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]''. The lawsuit claims that OEM did not take proper measures to protect its product as stated in its contract with Ubisoft. The complaint also alleges that OEM admitted to all the problems in the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/8547-ubisoft-suing-over-assassins-creed-leak/| title=Ubisoft suing over Assassin's Creed leak| first=Lydia| last=Sung| publisher=Neoseeker| date=August 7, 2008| accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
