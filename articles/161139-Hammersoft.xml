'''The University of Scranton''' is a private, co-educational [[Catholic]] and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[university]], located in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], in the northeast region of the state. The school was founded in 1888 by Most Rev. [[William O'Hara]], the first [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton|Bishop of Scranton]], as '''St. Thomas College'''.

The institution was operated by the Diocese, and later the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools |Lasallian Christian Brothers]], from 1888 to 1942. In 1942, Bishop [[William Joseph Hafey]] invited the [[Society of Jesus]] to take charge of the university. Today, the University of Scranton is one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]]. Around 30 Jesuits are normally in residence at Scranton.

The University is composed of four colleges: The College of Arts and Sciences, The Kania School of Management, The Panuska College of Professional Studies, and The College of Graduate and Continuing Education (a recent merger of the Graduate School and The Dexter Hanley College).

===The University of Scranton Alma Mater===

The hours too quickly slip away&lt;br&gt;
And mingle into years&lt;br&gt;
But memories of our Scranton days will last&lt;br&gt;
Whatever next appears.&lt;br&gt;
The legacy from those before&lt;br&gt;
Is briefly ours to hold,&lt;br&gt;
We leave the best behind for others&lt;br&gt;
As the coming years unfold.

With faith in lives that touch us here&lt;br&gt;
And paths that ours have crossed&lt;br&gt;
We know that reaching for the rising sun&lt;br&gt;
Is surely worth the cost.&lt;br&gt;
May God be ever at our side,&lt;br&gt;
May goodness fill our days.&lt;br&gt;
We hail as loving sons and daughters&lt;br&gt;
Alma mater ours always.
