&quot;'''Sexy'''&quot; is the fifteenth episode of the [[Glee (season 2)|second season]] of the American television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', and the 37th overall. It was written by [[Brad Falchuk]], directed by [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], and premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on March 8, 2011. This episode mainly revolves around the topics of [[sex]] and [[adolescent sexuality]]. In this episode, [[Holly Holliday]] ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]) returns to McKinley High School as a substitute teacher in a class devoted to [[sex education]]. The school glee club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]) begins to develop deep feelings for Holliday, and the guidance counselor and celibacy club advisor [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]) is less than pleased with Holly's lessons. Meanwhile, [[Santana Lopez|Santana]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) expresses her love for [[Brittany Pierce|Brittany]] ([[Heather Morris (actress)|Heather Morris]]), and [[Burt Hummel]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]) has a talk with his son [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) about sex.

&quot;Sexy&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from critics and fans alike. Many critics went on to praise Paltrow's performance, preferring it to her first appearance in &quot;[[The Substitute (Glee)|The Substitute]]&quot;. However, they disagreed over how Paltrow was used. The storylines were met with general acclaim, particularly the plot between Brittany and Santana. Critics such as Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' and Patrick Burns of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' deemed the storyline as the highlight of the episode. This episode featured [[cover versions]] of five songs, including a cover of &quot;[[Kiss (song)|Kiss]]&quot; by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and &quot;[[Landslide (song)|Landslide]]&quot; by [[Fleetwood Mac]]. The musical performances and cover versions in the episode had a mixed reception from critics.

Upon its original airing, this episode was viewed by 11.92&amp;nbsp;million American viewers, and garnered a 4.6/14 [[Nielsen ratings#Ratings/share and total viewers|Nielsen rating/share]] in the [[Nielsen ratings#Demographics|18â49 demographic]], according to the [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nr&quot;/&gt; The episode's total viewership and ratings increased significantly from the previous episode, &quot;[[Blame It on the Alcohol]]&quot;, which was viewed by 10.58&amp;nbsp;million American viewers, and it acquired a 4.4/12 rating/share in the 18â49 demographic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alcohol&quot;/&gt;

==Plot==
Substitute teacher [[Holly Holliday]] ([[Gwyneth Paltrow]]) returns to McKinley High to cover [[sex education]] classes, and tells [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]), director of the school [[glee club]] New Directions, that his club members are among the most ignorant about sex. He asks her to educate them using song, so Holly performs [[Joan Jett]]'s cover of &quot;[[Do You Wanna Touch Me#Joan Jett version|Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)]]&quot;. Will later rehearses a rendition of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s &quot;[[Kiss (song)|Kiss]]&quot; with her, which culminates in a kiss, but Holly will not go further as she believes she would end up hurting him.

[[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]), director of rival glee club Aural Intensity, seeks out former New Directions member and current Dalton Academy Warbler [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]) to tell him and his friend [[Blaine Anderson|Blaine]] ([[Darren Criss]]), the Warblers' lead singer, that New Directions is planning a sexually provocative routine for the upcoming Regionals competition, having heard that the judges will be looking for same. Blaine responds by having the Warblers work up a &quot;sexified&quot; performance of &quot;[[Animal (Neon Trees song)|Animal]]&quot; by [[Neon Trees]], with Kurt joining him on lead, but Kurtâs &quot;sexy&quot; faces and moves are anything but. Kurt insists on remaining ignorant of sexual matters, which Blaine feels is dangerous at their age, so he visits Kurt's father, [[Burt Hummel|Burt]] ([[Mike O'Malley]]), and prompts him to give Kurt &quot;[[The birds and the bees|the talk]]&quot; about sex.

At McKinley, glee club members [[Puck (Glee)|Puck]] ([[Mark Salling]]) and [[Lauren Zizes|Lauren]] ([[Ashley Fink]]) plan to make a [[sex tape]], until Holly informs them that it would be considered [[child pornography]]. Puck, appalled, joins the celibacy club. The club's advisor [[Emma Pillsbury]] ([[Jayma Mays]]) thinks Holly's lessons are inappropriate, so she arranges for the club to perform a wholesome song for New Directions. She picks [[Starland Vocal Band]]'s &quot;[[Afternoon Delight (song)|Afternoon Delight]]&quot;, unaware that the song is about sex. Her husband [[Carl Howell|Carl]] ([[John Stamos]]) approaches Holly afterward about counseling. During the counseling session, he reveals that Emma is still a virgin, and Emma admits that she may still have feelings for Will. Carl tells her he will be moving into a hotel until she is certain of her feelings.

Holly also counsels glee club members [[Santana Lopez|Santana]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) and [[Brittany Pierce|Brittany]] ([[Heather Morris (actress)|Heather Morris]]) when they express confusion about their sexuality. She joins them for a performance of &quot;[[Landslide (song)|Landslide]]&quot; by [[Fleetwood Mac]], after which Santana tearfully confesses that she is in love with Brittany and wants to be with her. However, after Kurt's experience as an openly [[homosexual|gay]] student at McKinley, Santana is afraid of being bullied and ostracized by the student body for being in a [[same-sex relationship]]. Brittany reciprocates her love, but explains that she also loves her boyfriend [[Artie Abrams|Artie]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]) and will not break up with him, to Santana's distress.

Lauren is annoyed with Puck for joining the celibacy club, but when he explains that he is trying to take responsibility for his actions, she kisses him and agrees to join too. [[Quinn Fabray|Quinn]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) shows up at the club meeting with a hickey on her neck from making out with [[Finn Hudson|Finn]] ([[Cory Monteith]]), though she claims the mark is from burning herself with a curling iron. Holly's stint as a sex education instructor ends when parents complain about her classes. She tells Will that she wants to learn about romance; he offers to teach her, and they kiss.

===Critical response===
&lt;!--;General--&gt;The episode received a positive response from critics. Reviewers disagreed over how well Paltrow was utilized, but generally praised the BrittanyâSantana and KurtâBlaine storylines. ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'s}} Kevin Fallon deemed &quot;Sexy&quot; an episode of mixed messages, one which treated the issues it raised with &quot;an appropriate amount of levity&quot;, but failed to &quot;play the nuances of the [celibacy vs. sex] argument as delicately as it probably thought it did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt; His ''Atlantic'' co-writer Patrick Burns criticized the series for glorifying a risquÃ© subject, &quot;then half-heartedly attempt[ing] to hammer home a moral.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt; Meghan Brown, also writing for ''The Atlantic'', called it a &quot;solid episode with some strong character moments.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} James Poniewozik felt that the episode &quot;began clumsily, lacked subtlety, involved some embarrassing moments&quot; and focused too much on Paltrow, but as it continued, &quot;achieve[d] a few moments of delight and honest emotion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2011/03/09/glee-watch-drowning-in-goop/|title=Glee Watch: Drowning in Goop|last=Poniewozik|first=James|date=March 9, 2011|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc]]|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--;Paltrow, Holly, Will--&gt;Several critics preferred Paltrow's return in &quot;Sexy&quot; to her first appearance in &quot;The Substitute&quot;. ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'s}} Lisa de Moraes felt that she was better integrated into this episode,&lt;ref name=&quot;LdM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/tvblog/2011/03/glee-gwyneth-paltrow-returns.html|title='Glee': Gwyneth Paltrow returns!

[[Image:Naya Rivera and Heather Morris.jpg|thumb|left|The developing relationship between Santana (Rivera, ''left'') and Brittany (Morris, ''right'') was well-received by critics.]]
&lt;!--;Brittany/Santana--&gt;The BrittanyâSantana plot received critical acclaim. Gonzalez was somewhat surprised by the storyline, observing that Santana had not previously been portrayed as &quot;so serious and vulnerable&quot;, but enjoyed the depth it brought to her character.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG&quot;/&gt; She and Poniewozik both praised Rivera's acting, with Gonzalez calling her &quot;heartbreakingly perfect&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG&quot;/&gt; Poniewozik did not find Santana's revelation sudden; he was impressed that the episode found &quot;pathos and heartbreak&quot; in a coupling formerly treated humorously.&lt;ref name=&quot;JP&quot;/&gt; VanDerWerff deemed it the best storyline of the episode, saying it was almost alone the reason the episode received a &quot;B&quot;. He called the scene where Santana confessed her feelings for Brittany one of the best moments of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;AV&quot;/&gt; Burns was pleased that the storyline was &quot;treated with a tender realness,&quot; something generally lacking on network television,&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt; and Brown, though unconvinced that Santana's conflicted sexuality adequately explained her abrasive personality, praised the series for &quot;exploring some of the more complicated aspects of adolescent sexuality&quot;, writing that &quot;''Glee'' does an admirable job of attempting to be all-inclusive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!--;Burt/Kurt--&gt;The fatherâson relationship between Kurt and Burt also drew positive reviews. de Moraes found it odd that Blaine approached Burt to talk to Kurt about sex, but wrote that their subsequent heart-to-heart was the &quot;closest thing to a satisfying conclusion&quot; the episode had.&lt;ref name=&quot;LdM&quot;/&gt; Fallon called it &quot;one of the most uncomfortable fatherâson sex talks ever committed to television (and thus, really, one of the most realistic)&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt; and Flandez found it sweet.&lt;ref name=&quot;RF&quot;/&gt; Though Gonzalez deemed it awkward to watch, she wrote that the scene served to convince her she had never loved a father-son pairing more.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG&quot;/&gt; Poniewozik also found it realistic and moving, giving particular praise to O'Malley for portraying Burt's &quot;determination and awkwardness in helping his son, without turning it into an afterschool special.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JP&quot;/&gt;

Musical performances in the episode attracted mixed commentary.

&lt;!--;&quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; --&gt;Gonzalez gave &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; a &quot;C&quot;. She highlighted its corniness, and wrote that Stamos was wasted on the performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--;&quot;Animal&quot;--&gt;&quot;Animal&quot; drew generally negative reviews, derided by Roberts as the only element of the episode &quot;less sexy than Paltrow&quot;.

&lt;!--;&quot;Kiss&quot;--&gt;Critics differed over the performance of &quot;Kiss&quot;. Roberts praised the &quot;real sex appeal&quot; Morrison brought to the number, but deemed Paltrow's tango rigid.&lt;ref name=&quot;SR&quot;/&gt; de Moraes observed that neither of them would have progressed past the first week of the reality series ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;LdM&quot;/&gt; and Burns commented that white people ought to be deterred from performing Prince. He called the music &quot;uninteresting and soulless&quot;, and was dismayed that the tango was &quot;just white with white people tango dancing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KF&quot;/&gt; Flandez, however, enjoyed their dancing, writing that &quot;The strong holds, the slow cuts, the perfect swivel of hips and the lean-toâs were mesmerizingly seductive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RF&quot;/&gt; Gonzales also enjoyed the choreography, but disliked Morrison's falsetto, and wished he has been allowed to sing in his own register throughout rather than imitating Prince. She graded the performance &quot;C+&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG&quot;/&gt; 

&lt;!--;&quot;Landslide&quot;--&gt;&quot;Landslide&quot; received a &quot;B+&quot; from Gonzalez, who wished that Rivera, rather than Paltrow, had sung the lead vocal, due to the meaning the song held for Santana.&lt;ref name=&quot;SG&quot;/&gt; Roberts found the performance &quot;pretty but uninspired&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SR&quot;/&gt; Flandez called it &quot;a dreamy, perfectly pitched power song of lesbian love&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;RF&quot;/&gt; Poniewozik &quot;surprisingly poignant&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;JP&quot;/&gt; and VanDerWerff named it the best number of the episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;AV&quot;/&gt; [[Stevie Nicks]] of Fleetwood Mac welcomed the cover of &quot;Landslide&quot;, hoping it would bring the band's songs to a new generation. She approved of the performance, and said that Paltrow &quot;sang it beautifully.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/glee-gwyneth-paltrow-landslide/|title=âGleeâ Cast Feat.
