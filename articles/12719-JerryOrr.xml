'''Gustave de Molinari''' (3 March 1819, LiÃ¨ge &amp;ndash; 28 January 1912, Adinkerke) was an [[economics|economist]] born in [[Belgium]] associated with [[France|French]] [[classical liberalism|laissez-faire liberal]] economists such as [[FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bastiat]] and [[Hippolyte Castille]]. Living in Paris, in the 1840s, he took part in the &quot;''Ligue pour la LibertÃ© des Ãchanges''&quot; (Free Trade League), animated by FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bastiat. On his death bed in 1850, Bastiat described Molinari as the continuator of his works. In 1849, shortly after [[The Revolutions of 1848 in France|the revolutions of the previous year]], Molinari published two works: an essay, &quot;The Production of Security&quot;, and a book, ''Les SoirÃ©es de la Rue Saint-Lazare'', describing how a [[Market economy|market]] in justice and protection could advantageously replace the [[Sovereign state|state]].

In the 1850s, Molinari fled to Belgium to escape threats from France's Emperor [[Napoleon III]].  He returned to Paris in the 1860s to work on the influential newspaper, ''[[Le Journal des Debats]]'', which he edited from 1871 to 1876. Molinari went on to edit the ''[[Journal des Ãconomistes]]'', the publication of the French Political Economy Society, from 1881 until 1909. In his 1899 book, ''The Society of Tomorrow'', he proposed a federated system of collective security, and reiterated his support for private competing defense agencies.

&quot;In his last work, published a year before his death in 1912, Molinari never relented:&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;[[Ralph Raico|Raico, Ralph]] (2011-03-29) [http://mises.org/daily/5088/Neither-the-Wars-Nor-the-Leaders-Were-Great Neither the Wars Nor the Leaders Were Great], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[American Civil War]] had not been simply a humanitarian crusade to free the slaves. The war &quot;ruined the conquered provinces,&quot; but the Northern plutocrats pulling the strings achieved their aim: the imposition of a vicious protectionism that led ultimately &quot;to the regime of trusts and produced the billionaires.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Molinari's grave is located at the [[PÃ¨re Lachaise]] cemetery in Paris, France.

==Influence==
Some [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] consider Molinari to be the first proponent of [[anarcho-capitalism]].&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt; In the preface to the 1977 English translation [[Murray Rothbard]] called ''The Production of Security'' the &quot;first presentation anywhere in human history of what is now called anarcho-capitalism&quot; though admitting that &quot;Molinari did not use the terminology, and probably would have balked at the name.&quot; [[Austrian School]] economist [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] says that &quot;the 1849 article The Production of Security is probably the single most important contribution to the modern theory of anarcho-capitalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann. [http://www.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe5.html ''Anarcho-Capitalism: An Annotated Bibliography'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Molinari influenced some of the political thoughts of [[market anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]] and the [[Liberty]] circle.&lt;ref&gt;David Hart's [http://mises.org/journals/jls/5_4/5_4_4.pdf Gustave De Molinari And The Anti-Statist Liberal Tradition]&lt;/ref&gt;

The market anarchist Molinari Institute, headed by philosopher [[Roderick Long]], is named after Molinari, who it calls the &quot;originator of the theory of Market Anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://praxeology.net/molinari.htm Molinari Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;
