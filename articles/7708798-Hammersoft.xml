Ms. Andrea Anders is the mistress of [[Francisco Scaramanga]]. She is portrayed by [[Maud Adams]], the only woman to play two separate Bond girls.

She is responsible for retrieving the custom made gold bullets from munitions manufacturer Lazar and delivering them to Scaramanga. She also provides services to Scaramanga as a lover only before he makes a kill, claiming like bullfighters it improves the eyesight. It is later revealed that it was Ms. Anders who sent the gold bullet to London as well as the note with Scaramanga's fingerprint on it with the hopes of Bond liberating her from Scaramanga's world. Scaramanga disposes of Ms. Anders with the use of his golden gun and gold bullet after learning of her affairs with Bond.

{{otheruses2|Nick Nack}}
'''Nick Nack''', played by [[France|French]] actor [[HervÃ© Villechaize]], is an all-round personal assistant to [[Francisco Scaramanga]], acting as butler, housekeeper, and chef, as well as a [[henchman]] to Scaramanga's criminal activities. Although Nick Nack is very loyal to Scaramanga, he sometimes hires assassins to try and kill him so that he may inherit his estate.  Scaramanga tolerates it as a means to practise his skills.  

After his master's defeat and death, and the loss of his inheritance when Scaramanga's base explodes, Nick Nack tries to kill Bond and Goodnight on the [[Junk (ship)|junk]] and after a short fight, an annoyed Bond stuffs him in a suitcase and locked him in a wooden cage where he awaits MI6 custody.

A distinctive feature of Nick Nack was his height, standing only 1.18 metres (3'11&quot;) tall.

Nick Nack appears in the 1990s animated spin-off, [[James Bond Jr]] as a member of the SCUM organisation and partner-in-crime of fellow henchman [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]].

Nick Nack was an inspiration for [[Doctor Evil]]'s [[Mini-Me]] in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] films, which parodied the James Bond series.

There's a mode in [[GoldenEye 007 (2010 video game)]] called &quot;Nick Nack Mode&quot;. In this mode, you can't go up ladders.

'''Hai Fat''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[James Bond]] film ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''. He is a multi-millionaire [[Thailand|Thai]] businessman and is portrayed by the late [[Richard Loo]].

Hai Fat, the owner of Hai Fat Industries, hires [[Francisco Scaramanga]] (the film's central villain) to assassinate the inventor of the &quot;Solex&quot; (a revolutionary solar energy device) and steal the Solex. British agents are also trying to trace the Solex; Hai Fat's name is mentioned and Bond suggests to [[M (James Bond)|M]] that they should meet. Bond then goes to Hai Fatâs property and breaks in, &quot;disguising&quot; himself as [[Scaramanga]] (whom he believes Hai Fat has never met) by applying a fake third nipple, an abnormality of Scaramanga's. Hai Fat tells Bond to leave, but then sees the third nipple on Bondâs chest and tells Bond to join him for dinner that night. Bond believes that Hai Fat thinks he is Scaramanga, but Hai Fat is later seen speaking with the real Scaramanga, telling him that he doesnât plan for Bond to get in his way.  When Bond goes to dinner, he is knocked out. Scaramanga's henchman [[Nick Nack]] is about to kill him, but Hai Fat stops him, telling him that Bond must go to &quot;school&quot; (which turns out to be a kung fu training school, where he intends that Bond should be killed). Hai Fat is next seen in his office talking to Scaramanga.  Hai Fat tells Scaramanga that he should have never employed him.  Scaramanga silently assembles his Golden Gun, and after Hai Fat takes the Solex out of his safe, Scaramanga shoots him dead. As the new chairman, Scaramanga first order is to have Hai Fat placed in Hai Fat's own tomb.

Hai-Fat almost isn't a henchman, as he is the one that employed Scaramanga as an understudy to his operations and assassin. Chula also is under the employ of Hai Fat as well as Nick Nack to some extent.
