The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[Denver Broncos]] [[List of Denver Broncos seasons|season]]''' was their 40th season in the NFL and 50th season overall. The [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]] matched their 8â8 regular season record from  [[2008 Denver Broncos season|2008]] but did not make the playoffs. The Broncos welcomed many new defensive players signed during free agency, including veteran [[Philadelphia Eagles|Eagles]] safety [[Brian Dawkins]]. This was their first season without head coach [[Mike Shanahan]] since 1994, as he was fired on December 30, 2008. On January 12, 2009, Denver hired the offensive coordinator of the [[New England Patriots]], [[Josh McDaniels]], to  be their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, McDaniels was the youngest head coach in any of the four major North American professional sports and the fifth-youngest NFL head coach ever, although less than a week later the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] named the even-younger [[Raheem Morris]] as their head coach.

(&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Acquired from [[Chicago Bears|Chicago]] in [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] trade.)
(&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Acquired from [[Seattle Seahawks|Seattle]] in exchange for Denver's [[2010 NFL Draft|2010]] first-round selection..)

===Jay Cutler controversy===
After head coach Josh McDaniels was hired, rumors eventually surfaced that a there was a three-way trade involving McDaniels' former team the [[New England Patriots]] and a third potential team ([[Detroit Lions]] or [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]) that would have sent Denver quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] to the Lions or Buccaneers and Denver would receive [[Matt Cassel]], who worked with McDaniels last season, from New England. After the trade talks surfaced, Cutler was angered and infuriated by the rumors because he didn't think he was going to be traded, and he refused to talk with either McDaniels or General Manager [[Brian Xanders]] after both had denied the rumors.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3944555&lt;/ref&gt;

Several teams became interested in trading for Cutler after it was apparent he was upset about this situation, though McDaniels confirmed that &quot;We are not trading Jay Cutler-Period.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.nfl.com/2009/03/03/mcdaniels-cutler-is-not-going-to-be-traded-period/&lt;/ref&gt; McDaniels insisted that Cutler is their quarterback.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Broncos fans and critics were mixed over the incident. Some say that Cutler, who has posted superb statistics over his career but has never led the Broncos to the playoffs, shouldn't be complaining and &quot;whining&quot; over trade rumors despite his superstar status. On the other hand, others are quick to dismissed McDaniels and Xanders for mishandling the situation and starting the rumors in the first place, as well as questioning why somebody would trade a player of Cutler's caliber who was meant to succeed former quarterback [[John Elway]] as the team's premier quarterback.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On March 11, 2009, Cutler and McDaniels agreed to meet for the first time since the incident. After having a [[conference call]] between them, sources said that the two sides drifted further apart, although the team refused to comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutler, McDaniels talk in conference call â Fox Sports on MSN &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://www.bcsfootball.org/nfl/story/9282052/Cutler,-McDaniels-talk-in-conference-call|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5hgozJf6o|archivedate=2009-06-21|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cutler eventually requested to be traded some time afterward, feeling that the &quot;trust&quot; between the organization and himself were all but gone, and missed one of Denver's voluntary training camps.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

On April 2, 2009, Denver traded Cutler, along with their 5th round pick (140th overall) in the [[2009 NFL Draft]], to the [[Chicago Bears]] in exchange for their 1st round and 3rd round (18th and 84th overall respectively) picks  in 2009, their 1st round pick in the [[2010 NFL Draft]], and quarterback [[Kyle Orton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4037373&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2009, the Broncos named Orton as their starting quarterback. This ends speculation of a competition between Orton and [[Chris Simms]]. However, within three days, WR [[Brandon Marshall]] wanted out of Denver and demanded a trade.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

}}
The game began with little action. Denver and Cincinnati both traded possessions to begin the game. However, on the Bengals' second possession they were able to drive deep into Denver territory, reaching the 11-yard line before setting up for a short field goal. However, the field goal snap was fumbled. After the flubbed field goal, both teams entered a period of offensive ineptness â Denver had four consecutive one-and-done drives, while Cincinnati was forced to punt, then had a promising drive end with a [[Carson Palmer]] interception after Denver [[cornerback]] [[Champ Bailey]] tipped the ball into the air and [[Wesley Woodyard]] recovered the interception. Denver was finally able to put together a drive at the end of the first half that finished with a [[Matt Prater]] 48-yard field goal as time ran out. Despite being out-gained in all offensive indicators, Denver took a 3â0 lead into halftime due to Cincinnati mistakes, including the fumbled field goal, interception, and multiple dropped passes.

During the third quarter, neither team was able to sustain an offensive drive â Cincinnati punted 3 times, while Denver punted 2 times. However, Denver's defense showed improvement, including one Cincinnati drive that ended after two consecutive [[quarterback sack|sacks]] of Carson Palmer. Denver was able to put together another field goal drive at the end of the third quarter, with Matt Prater this time kicking a 50-yard field goal to put the Broncos on top 6â0.

The fourth quarter continued in much the same vein. Denver made it into field goal range again before a 5-yard penalty and 7-yard sack forced them to punt it away again. However, Cincinnati was able to put together their first sustained drive of the entire game during the second half of the quarter â the Bengals gained 90 yards on 11 plays over 5:40. This culminated with a 1-yard [[Cedric Benson]] touchdown run that avoided a Bengals shutout and put them on top for the first time.

Denver regained control of the ball at their own 13-yard line with 38 seconds remaining. After an incomplete pass, [[Kyle Orton]] attempted a pass to [[Brandon Marshall]] with 28 seconds remaining. The ball was tipped into the air by Bengals [[defensive back]] [[Leon Hall]] and into the hands of Denver [[wide receiver]] [[Brandon Stokley]], who then took it untouched 87 yards to the end zone with 11 seconds remaining. Records showed that this was the longest play from scrimmage in NFL history with less than 1 minute remaining in the game. The play was referred to by some as &quot;The Immaculate Deflection&quot; after [[The Immaculate Reception]]. Denver took a 12â7 lead but failed a [[two-point conversion]]. A desperation hail mary pass by Carson Palmer was intercepted in the end zone with 5 seconds to play by Denver [[tight end]] [[Tony Scheffler]].

====Week 2: vs. Cleveland Browns====

Coming off their last-second victory over the Bengals, the Broncos would play their Week 2 home opener against the [[Cleveland Browns]].  In the first quarter, Denver would trail early as Browns kicker [[Phil Dawson]] got a 22-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Broncos took the lead as quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Tony Scheffler]].  Cleveland would creep close as Dawson made a 47-yard field goal, but Denver would answer as kicker [[Matt Prater]] got a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 38-yard field goal in the third quarter.  In the fourth, the Broncos pulled away as fullback [[Peyton Hillis]] got a 2-yard touchdown run and running back [[Correll Buckhalter]] got a 45-yard touchdown run.

With the win, Denver improved to 2â0.

====Week 3: at Oakland Raiders====

}}

After Oakland began the game with a 3-and-out, Denver sustained a long drive deep into Oakland territory. However, the Raiders orchestrated a successful goal-line stand, forcing Denver to turn the ball over on downs after a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line was stopped. Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback [[JaMarcus Russell]] was intercepted by Denver [[safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Renaldo Hill]] after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard [[Kyle Orton]] pass to [[Brandon Marshall]]. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos [[cornerback]] [[Andre Goodman]]. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Matt Prater]], giving them a 10â0 lead going into the 2nd quarter.

Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful. They went 56 yards in over 8 minutes, leading to a 48-yard [[Sebastian Janikowski]] field goal. Denver then drove 76 yards, although Oakland again held Denver out of the end zone, leading to a 21-yard Prater field goal and giving the Broncos a 13â3 lead going into halftime. Denver then opened the half with another scoring drive, this time going 80 yards in 8 plays and scoring on a 7-yard run by rookie [[running back]] [[Knowshon Moreno]]. It was the first touchdown of Moreno's NFL career. Oakland was forced to punt on their next drive. However, on Denver's first play from scrimmage, running back [[Correll Buckhalter]] fumbled the ball at their own 16-yard line, giving Oakland the ball in Denver territory for just the 3rd time on the day. However, 2 plays later, Raiders running back [[Darren McFadden]] fumbled the ball for the second time on the day (the first time was recovered by Oakland), giving Denver the ball back at their own 11. They then drove 88 yards in 16 plays and over 8 minutes, although the Raiders again held them out of the end zone, leading to a Prater 24-yard field goal.

The Broncos won the game primarily on the strength of their running game and the defense. Correll Buckhalter ran 14 times for 108 yards, while rookie Knowshown Moreno ran 21 times for 90 yards. Overall, the Broncos had 215 yards rushing on the day. The defense held the Raiders to just 137 total yards and 9 first downs, caused 2 interceptions and 1 fumble, and also sacked JaMarcus Russell 3 times, 2 of them by star [[defensive end]] [[Elvis Dumervil]] (who had 4 in the previous game against the [[Cleveland Browns]]). Russell had just 61 yards passing on 21 attempts with 2 interceptions, giving him a quarterback rating of 22.6. Kyle Orton had 157 yards passing on 23 attempts with 1 touchdown and 0 interceptions, giving him a respectable 92.1 rating.

With the win, Denver improved to 3â0.

Coming off their divisional road win over the Raiders, the Broncos went home for a Week 4 interconference duel with the [[Dallas Cowboys]].  Denver would struggle out of the gates in the first quarter, as Cowboys kicker [[Nick Folk]] got a 49-yard field goal and running back [[Marion Barber III|Marion Barber]] would acquire a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Broncos would start to gain some momentum in the second quarter with quarterback [[Kyle Orton]]'s 9-yard touchdown pass to rookie running back [[Knowshon Moreno]].  After a scoreless third quarter, Denver would take command of the game in the fourth quarter.  The Broncos would get a 28-yard field goal from kicker [[Matt Prater]], followed by Orton's 51-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Brandon Marshall]].  Afterwards, the defense would manage to hold off a late Dallas drive that actually made it to their 1-yard line.

Coming off of a home win against the Cowboys, the Broncos stayed at home, donned their throwback uniforms, and prepared for a Week 5 AFL Legacy game with the [[New England Patriots]].  This would mark the highly-anticipated match-up between Denver head coach [[Josh McDaniels]] and New England's head coach [[Bill Belichick]].

The Broncos would trail in the first quarter as Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] hooked up with wide receiver [[Wes Welker]] on an 8-yard touchdown pass, followed by kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] getting a 53-yard field goal.  Denver would answer in the second quarter as quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] connected with wide receiver [[Brandon Marshall]] on an 11-yard touchdown pass, but New England would close out the half with Brady's 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Benjamin Watson]].

The Broncos would tie the game in the second half as kicker [[Matt Prater]] nailed a 24-yard field goal in the third quarter, followed by Orton finding Marshall again on an 11-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter.  In overtime, Denver won possession and never relinquished possession as Prater booted the game-winning 41-yard field goal.

Coming off an impressive home win over the Patriots, the Broncos flew to [[Qualcomm Stadium]], donned their throwbacks again, and played a Week 6 AFL Legacy game with the [[San Diego Chargers]] on Monday night.  Even though the Chargers kicked off the first quarter with a 20-yard field goal from kicker [[Nate Kaeding]], the Broncos immediately struck back with wide receiver [[Eddie Royal]] returned the kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown.

Trying to snap a two-game losing streak, the Broncos flew to [[FedEx Field]] for a Week 10 interconference duel with the [[Washington Redskins]].  In the first quarter, Denver struck first as quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] found wide receiver [[Brandon Marshall]] on a 40-yard touchdown pass.  The Redskins would respond as quarterback [[Jason Campbell]] completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Todd Yoder]], yet the Broncos would answer with Orton going right back to Marshall again on a 75-yard touchdown pass.  Washington would tie the game again in the second quarter with a trick play as punter [[Hunter Smith]] completed a 35-yard touchdown pass to fullback [[Mike Sellers]].  Denver would close out the half with a 24-yard field goal from kicker [[Matt Prater]] but on the previous play Orton (11/18 for 193 yards, 2 TDs) left the game with an ankle injury. This injury would prove costly not only in this game but the next for the Broncos. [[Chris Simms]] replaced Orton at quarterback but was unable to get anything going on offense for the Broncos, going a dismal 3/21 for 13 yards with 1 INT. After a scoreless third quarter, the Redskins would take the lead in the fourth quarter with a 1-yard touchdown run from running back [[Ladell Betts]] and a 35-yard field goal from kicker [[Shaun Suisham]].

Coming off a two game winning streak, the Broncos headed to Lucas Oil Stadium to play the undefeated Colts. In the first half, the Colts jumped out to a 21â0 lead. Denver finally scored when Kyle Orton found Brandon Marshall in the end zone going to the locker rooms trailing 21â7. For most of the second half, the Colts offense sputtered. In a long drive, Orton found Marshall for his second touchdown, however, the two point conversion was no good, making the score 21â16. Then the Colts offense got things going late in the fourth. After a long drive, Manning found Dallas Clark in the end zone for his third touchdown of the day, putting the Colts on top 28â16 with under three minutes left in the game. On a long fourth down, Orton found Marshall who lateraled the ball to a lineman who was tackled short of the first down. With the win, the Colts broke an NFL record with 23 straight wins. Though despite the loss, Broncos WR Brandon Marshall had a record of his own with 21 catches beating Terrell Owens' record.
