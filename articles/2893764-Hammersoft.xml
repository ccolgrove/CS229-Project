| '''Dark Danny Phamtom''' || &quot;The Ultimate Enemy&quot; (episode #27) ||colspan=2| '''Dark Danny Phantom''' (also known as Dan Phantom, Dan Plasmius, Dark Phantom or simply Anti Danny Phantom; voiced by [[Eric Roberts]]) is a villain created by the fusion of the ghost-halves of Danny Phantom (the show's protagonist) and Vlad Plasmius (his arch-enemy) in an alternative timeline. He was created with the intent that Danny's worst enemy would be an evil version of himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hometown.aol.com/zcat6/IntBH2006p5.html Butch Hartman Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Danny is a cruel, malicious ghost who cares little for anything other than himself, creating destruction wherever he goes.

Dark Danny came to be after a fatal and accidental explosion of the Nasty Burger's boiler that caused the explicit death of Danny Fenton's family, friends, and teacher. Grief-stricken and guilty, Danny moved in with Vlad Masters, feeling that only he could understand his pain. Danny asked Vlad to remove his emotions. Honoring the boy's wishes, Vlad separated Danny's human half from his ghost self, but then the latter retaliated afterward and did the same to Vlad. The ghost half of Danny then attempted to overshadow Plasmius, and ended up fusing their two bodies together. Plasmius's evil ghost half overwhelmed Danny's ghost half, creating an even more evil and powerful version of the two halves. He then destroyed Vlad's castle and his own human half.

He spent the next ten years destroying the world. Through complex time traveling and the help of [[#Ghost Allies|Clockwork]], the present-day Danny managed to defeat his evil self with the element of surprise, using his newly acquired Ghostly Wail- a power that Dark Danny only manifested shortly before he came back in time- against him. Dark Danny is currently trapped in a Fenton Thermos in Clockwork's lair.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ultimate Enemy&quot;/&gt;

| '''Ember McLain''' || &quot;Fanning the Flames&quot; (episode #11) ||colspan=2| '''Ember McLain''' ([[Tara Strong]], [[Robin Kimissel]]) is a power-hungry musician who hates authority. She thirsts for attention and has a seductively cutting, sarcastic personality. For this, she gains power when people say her name, as is shown in her first appearance when she attempted to gain power by performing the song [[Remember (Ember song)|Remember]] live and broadcasting worldwide in the hope that everyone would chant her name at the same time and empower her. She is somewhat similar to a [[siren]], as she can also hypnotize her victims, using her guitar as her main mode of hypnotism as well as a weapon.

Ember is known for teaming up with other ghosts to show off her divine ghost powers. In the series, she has teamed up with Kitty, Penelope Spectra and Youngblood on several occasions, usually attacking authority in society. In the episode &quot;Girls' Night Out&quot; she is shown to be dating Skulker.
