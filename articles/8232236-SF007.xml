'''OpenJDK''' ('''Open Java Development Kit''') is a [[Free software|free]] and [[open source]] implementation of the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the result of an effort [[Sun Microsystems]] began in 2006. The implementation is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) with a [[GPL linking exception|linking exception]], which exempts components of the [[Java Class Library|Java class library]] from the GPL [[licensing]] terms.

== History ==
{{See also2|[[Java (Sun)#Licensing|Licensing]]}}

=== Sun's promise and initial release ===
[[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] announced in [[JavaOne|JavaOne 2006]] that Java would become open-source software,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on October 25, 2006, at the [[Oracle OpenWorld]] conference, [[Jonathan I. Schwartz|Jonathan Schwartz]] said that the company intended to announce the open-sourcing of the core [[Java Platform]] within 30 to 60 days.

Sun released the Java [[HotSpot]] virtual machine and compiler as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] on November 13, 2006, with a promise that the rest of the JDK (which includes the [[Java Runtime Environment]]) would be placed under the GPL by March 2007, &quot;except for a few components that Sun does not have the right to publish in source form under the GPL&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

=== Release of the class library ===
Following their promise to release a [[Java Development Kit]] (JDK) based almost completely on free and open source code in the first half of 2007 [http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/java/faq.jsp#b4], Sun released the complete [[source code]] of the Java Class Library under the GPL on May 8, 2007, except for some limited parts that some third parties licensed to Sun that rejected the terms of the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

| date = May 8, 2007
| accessdate=May 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the list of encumbered parts were several major components of the Java [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). Sun stated that it planned to replace the remaining [[proprietary software|proprietary]] components with alternative implementations and to make the class library completely free.&lt;ref&gt;Some [[Closed source#Encumbered code|encumbered code]]{{clarify|date=October 2010}} remains in the JDK; Sun stated that it will continue to use such code in commercial releases until fully functional free and open source alternatives replace it.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Whenâ Whereâ --&gt;

=== Community improvements ===
On November 5, 2007, [[Red Hat]] announced an agreement with Sun, signing Sun's broad contributor agreement (which covers participation in all Sun-led free and open source software projects by all Red Hat engineers) and Sun's OpenJDK Community [[Technology Compatibility Kit]] (TCK) License Agreement (which gives the company access to the test suite that determines whether a project based on openJDK complies with the Java SE 6 specification).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20071105005882&amp;newsLang=en Broad contributor agreement and TCK License pave way for a fully compatible, free and open source Java Development Kit for Red Hat Enterprise Linux]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on November 2007, the ''Porters Group'' was created on OpenJDK&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjdk.java.net/groups/porters/ Porters Group]&lt;/ref&gt; to aid in efforts to port OpenJDK to different [[Microarchitecture|processor architectures]] and [[operating system]]s.
The [[BSD]] porting projects [http://www.eyesbeyond.com/freebsddom/java/jdk16.html], led by Kurt Miller and Greg Lewis and the [[Mac OS X]] porting project (based on the BSD one) [http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/static/soylatte SoyLatte] led by Landon Fuller [http://landonf.bikemonkey.org/code/macosx/] have expressed interest in joining OpenJDK via the Porters Group and as of January 2008 are part of the mailing list discussions. Another project pending formalization on the Porters Group is the [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]] Java Team, led by Bryan Varner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://haiku-os.org/news/2008-01-03/new_java_for_haiku_team_formed New java for haiku team formed]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2007, Sun moved the [[revision control]] of OpenJDK from [[Sun WorkShop TeamWare|TeamWare]] to [[Mercurial (software)|Mercurial]], as part of the process of releasing it to [[open source]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview

OpenJDK has comparatively strict procedures of accepting code contributions: every proposed contribution must be reviewed by two of Sun's engineers and the contributor must have signed the Sun/Oracle Contributor Agreement.(SCA/OCA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Collaboration with IBM, Apple, and SAP ===
On October 11, 2010, [[IBM]], by far the biggest participant in the [[Apache Harmony]] project, decided to join [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] on the OpenJDK project, effectively shifting its efforts from Harmony to OpenJDK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Apple will contribute most of the key components, tools and technology required for a Java SE 7 implementation on Mac OS X, including a 32-bit and 64-bit HotSpot-based Java virtual machine, class libraries, a networking stack and the foundation for a new graphical client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On January 11, 2011, the Mac OS X Port Project was created on OpenJDK, and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] made the first public contribution of code to the project. The initial Apple contribution built on OpenJDK [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] port&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In July 2011, [[SAP AG]] announced that SAP officially joined the OpenJDK project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Status ==
=== Supported JDK versions ===
OpenJDK was initially based only on the [[Java_version_history#Java_SE_7|JDK 7.0 version]] of the Java platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=''Sun did make that promise, and we plan to keep it. But in the six months since the November&amp;nbsp;2006 announcement, it has become clear that doing this is far more complex than just changing the license and publishing the source code.''
| publisher=Sun Microsystems
| accessdate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since February 15, 2008, there are two separate OpenJDK projects:
* The main [http://openjdk.java.net/ OpenJDK] project, which is based on the JDK 7.0 version of the Java platform,
* The [http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk6/ OpenJDK 6] project, which provides an Open-source version of [[Java version history#Java SE 6 (December 11, 2006)|Java 6.0]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=The code is coming! The code is coming!

=== Compiler and virtual machine ===
Sun's Java compiler, [[javac]], and [[HotSpot]] (the [[virtual machine]]), are now under a [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license.

=== Class library ===
{{See also|Java Class Library}}

As of the first May 2007 release, 4% of the OpenJDK class library remained proprietary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== IcedTea and inclusion in software distributions ===
{{Main|IcedTea}}

To be able to bundle OpenJDK in [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]] and other free [[Linux distribution]]s, OpenJDK needed to be buildable using only [[free software]] components. Due to the encumbered components in the [[Java Class Library|class library]] and implicit assumptions within the build system that the JDK being used to build OpenJDK was a Sun JDK{{Why?|date=October 2010}}, this was not possible. In order to achieve this goal, a project called IcedTea was started by [[Red Hat]] in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
