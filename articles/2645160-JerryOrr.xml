'''Ahmad Alaq''' (died 1503) ({{lang-ug|Ø£Ø­ÙØ¯|}}), was Khan of eastern [[Moghulistan]] ([[East Turkestan|Uyghurstan]]) from 1487 to 1503. He was the second son of [[Yunus Khan]]. His mother was Shah Begum,  fourth daughter of [[Badakhshan]] prince Lali, who was considered to be the descendant of [[Alexander the Great]].

==Life==
During his father's lifetime Ahmad was behind several rebellions against him. When Yunus Khan took up residence in [[Tashkent]] in 1484, Ahmad and a large body of Moghuls fled to the steppes. In 1487, Ahmad's father died and was succeeded in the territory he still controlled by another son, [[Mahmud Khan (Moghul Khan)|Mahmud Khan]].

Ahmad's reign was marked by conflicts with several of his neighbors. Conflict in the [[Ming Turpan Border Wars]] over [[Hami City|Hami]] with the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[China]] resulted in an economic blockade of the region, which allowed the Chinese to eventually emerge victorious. A campaign against the [[Mirza Abu Bakr Dughlatâ]], of the Dughlats of the south-west [[Tarim Basin]], who were in theory vassals of the Moghul khans, resulted in the temporary acquisition of [[Kashgar]] in around 1499. Expeditions against the [[Kalmyks]] also seem to have resulted in a measure of success. For these expeditions he was nicknamed  &quot; ''Alach (Alaq)'' &quot;,  ''Slaughterer''.

In the early 16th century, Ahmad and Mahmud decided to counter the growing power of the [[Uzbeks]] under [[Muhammad Shaybani]]. The two brothers united the forces and launched a campaign against the Uzbeks, but Muhammad Shaybani proved victorious in battle and took them both prisoner ([[Babur]] also was among his uncles' army and participated in this battle in [[Ferghana Valley]], that had turned into disaster, but managed to flee south and hide in mountains with his mother, Kutluk Nigar Khanim, daughter of [[Yunus Khan]], and few followers). They were soon released, but Ahmad died shortly afterwards, in 1503. He was succeeded in Uyghurstan by his eldest son [[Mansur Khan (Moghul Khan)|Mansur Khan]]. According to [[Mirza Muhammad Haidar, Dughlat]] he had 19 sons total, most prominent of whom were:
*[[Mansur Khan (Moghul Khan)|Mansur Khan]]- ruler of eastern Moghulistan or Uyghurstan in 1503-1543  (it included cities [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]], [[Uqturpan County|Uch Turpan]], [[Baicheng County|Bai]], [[Kucha]], Chalish or [[Karashahr]], [[Turpan]] and [[Kumul (city)|Kumul]]).
*[[Sultan Said Khan]]- seized power from Dughlat Amirs' Dynasty of Yarkand state in 1514 (known at the time as ''Mamlakati Yarkand'' or ''Kashgar Emirate'', it included cities [[Kashgar]], [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]], [[Yengisar County|Yangihissar]], [[Hotan]] and at short times also [[Aksu, Xinjiang|Aksu]] and [[Uqturpan County|Uch Turpan]]) in West [[Kashgaria]] and united in 1516 western and eastern parts of Kashgaria in one centralized state- Kashgar and Uyghurstan. Died in 1533 of [[asthma]] during military expedition in ''Ursang'' ( Great Tibet ).
*Sultan Khalil Sultan- ruler of western Moghulistan in 1503-1508 (present [[Kyrgyzstan]]). Was drowned in river near ''Akhsi''  in [[Fergana Valley]] after he was captured there by Uzbek sultans.
*Chin Temur Sultan- was in service of both Sultan Said Khan and Mansur Khan, but eventually fled to [[Babur]] of [[Moghul Empire]] in [[India]]. Died of violent dysentery in [[Agra]] and was buried there.
*Yunus Temur Sultan- fled from service of Sultan Said Khan and Mansur Khan and entered to Babur service in India.
