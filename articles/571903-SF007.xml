'''Tencent QQ''', generally referred to as '''QQ''', is the most popular free [[instant messaging]] [[computer program]] in [[mainland China]]. As of July 11, 2011, the active QQ users accounts for QQ IM totaled 812.3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tencent.com/en-us/at/abouttencent.shtml|title=About Tencent|publisher=Tencent.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly making it the world's second largest online community. The number of simultaneous online QQ accounts exceeded 100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://im.qq.com/online.shtml#qq |title=è¾è®¯QQææ°24å°æ¶å¨çº¿æ°æ® |publisher=Im.qq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, QQ.com ranked 10th overall in the [[Alexa Internet]] rankings just behind [[Twitter]] ranked 9th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details/qq.com| title=Alexa Web Search - QQ traffic details| accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is maintained by [[Tencent Holdings Limited]] ({{hkex2|0700}}), owned in part by [[Naspers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naspers.com/Company_History.cfm?content=2651 Naspers Company Profile / Company History ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its entrance into Chinese households, QQ quickly emerged as a modern cultural phenomenon, now being portrayed in [[popular culture]]. Aside from the chat program, QQ has also developed many subfeatures including games, virtual pets, ringtone downloads, blogs, etc.

==Naming==
The original name of QQ was OICQ (&quot;Open ICQ&quot;), based on an extant [[instant messaging]] service (IMS), [[ICQ]].

The abbreviation &quot;ICQ&quot; came from using letters that sound like &quot;I seek you&quot;.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
Tencent was founded in [[Shenzhen]], China, on November 11, 1998, by [[Ma Huateng]].  Tencent's instant messaging service platform, &quot;QQ&quot; was formally launched in February 1999. In March 2003, Tencent was able to buy the Internet Domain QQ.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vb.com/short.htm |title=Internet Hall of Fame Timeline - Two Letter Domains |publisher=Vb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of strong business growth, on July 16, 2004, Tencent Holdings Limited ([[Hong Kong Stock Exchange|SEHK]] 700) went public.

==Development==
QQ was initially developed by [[Tencent Holdings Limited|Tencent Inc.]] in February [[1999]]. It was first released as a &quot;Network Paging&quot; real time communications service. Then other features were successively added such as [[chatroom]]s, games, [[Avatar (computing)|personal avatars]] (similar to &quot;Meego&quot; in MSN), internet storage, and [[internet dating]] services. Most of these features were free. Its variety of features and easy-to-use interface made it very popular, especially among teenage users. In a few short years, it was the most popular real time communications service in China.

The current preview version of QQ is QQ2011 beta2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://im.qq.com/index.shtml |title=QQ Official Software Center |publisher=Im.qq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tencent periodically releases special versions of QQ to coincide with events such as the Olympics or Chinese New Year.

The official client runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] and a beta public version was launched for [[Mac OS X]] version 10.4.9 or newer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://im.qq.com/qq/mac/ |title=im.qq.com/qq/mac/ |publisher=Im.qq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web versions, WebQQ (full version) and WebQQ Mini (Lite version), which makes use of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], are currently available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webqq.qq.com |title=WebQQ |publisher=webqq.qq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w.qq.com |title=WebQQ Mini |publisher=w.qq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2008, Tencent released an official client for Linux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://im.qq.com/qq/linux/ |title=QQ for Linux |publisher=im.qq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this has not since been kept in step with the Windows version.

[[Image:TencetTM.PNG|right|thumb|User Interface of Tencent Messenger]]
In response to competition with [[Windows Live Messenger]], Tencent released Tencent Messenger, which is for business people. It also provides, in limited form, features that are only available to premium members in normal QQ.

A [[beta version]] of QQ is currently available for [[Symbian]] [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] 3rd Edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile.qq.com/mobile2008b2/ ææºQQ2008beta2åå¸]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership===
QQ currently allows free registration for membership. In [[2002]], Tencent stopped its free membership registration, requiring all new members to pay a fee, but in [[2003]], this decision was reversed due to pressure from other instant messaging services such as [[Windows Live Messenger]] and [[SINA.com|Sina UC]].
Tencent currently offers a premium membership scheme, which offers features such as QQ mobile, ringtone downloads, and SMS sending/receiving. In addition, Tencent offers &quot;Diamond&quot; level memberships. Currently, there are seven diamond services available:
* Red, for the QQ Show service which features the ability to make an avatar for yourself.
* Yellow, for the [[Qzone]] service which is similar to a blog.
* Blue, which is for QQ games.
* Purple, which is shared between four Tencent games, QQNana, a Korean dancing game, QQTang, an action game, extremely similar to crazy acrade and Pacman and QQSpeed, a car race game, and R2beat, a roller skating rhythm racing game.
* Pink, for QQ pet, a small desktop game about raising a pet. So far there are 3 generations of pets. Penguin, Pig, and Bear (beta testing).
* Green, for QQ music, which is a software for listening to music directly from the Tencent server. Requiring no pre-download, though sometimes consuming a lot of disk space due to caching.
* VIP, for chatting, beta testing, removing advertising, and several additional features
* Black (recently introduced) DNF (å°ä¸åä¸åå£«), a Tencent PVP game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnf.qq.com/vip/info.htm |title=dnf.qq.com/vip/info.htm |publisher=Dnf.qq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merchandise==
Tencent has taken advantage of the popularity of the QQ brand, and has set up many Q-Gen stores selling QQ branded merchandise such as bags, watches, clothing as well as toy penguins.

==Controversies and criticisms==
QQ has faced many criticisms and controversies. Many users complain QQ provides fewer and fewer free services and an annoying number of ads.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Dispute with Qihoo 360===
{{main|360 v. Tencent}}
China's anti-virus company, Qihoo 360, analyzed the QQ protocol and accused QQ of automatically scanning users' computers and of uploading their personal information to QQ's servers without users' consent. In response, Tencent called 360 itself [[malware]] and denied users with 360 installed access to some QQ services. The Chinese [[Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Industry and Information]] reprimanded both companies for &quot;improper competition&quot; and ordered them to come to an accord.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e0e12040-f5ab-11df-99d6-00144feab49a.html|title=Beijing probes Tencent and Qihoo 360|first=Kathrin|last=Hille|location=Beijing|date=2010-11-21|accessdate=2011-01-09|publisher=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other issues===
A program distributed with QQ censors and monitors the user's behavior on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/08/world/asia/08censor.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2&amp;ref=technology| title=Chinaâs Censors Tackle and Trip Over the Internet | work=The New York Times | first1=Michael| last1=Wines| first2=Sharon| last2=Lafraniere| first3=Jonathan| last3=Ansfield| date=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of QQ's extensive use of advertisements and processes related to ads, it has been branded as malicious [[adware]] by many anti-virus and anti-spyware vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tenebril.com/src/info.php?id=441301950 |title=Spyware Research Center - Tencent QQ |publisher=Tenebril |date=2004-10-27 |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca.com/us/securityadvisor/pest/pest.aspx?id=453083549 |title=www.ca.com/us/securityadvisor/pest/pest.aspx?id=453083549 |publisher=Ca.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securemost.com/articles/rm_tencent_qq.htm |title=Remove Tencent QQ - Spyware / Adware Uninstall Instruction |publisher=Securemost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2004, QQ Games began filtering keywords such as &quot;éé±¼å²&quot; ([[Diaoyu Islands]]) and &quot;ä¿é&quot; (Movement to protect the [[Diaoyu Islands]]). This act caused much controversy and Tencent has since lifted the filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=15581 |title=AsiaMedia :: CHINA: Web users get their ten cents worth despite the censors |publisher=Asiamedia.ucla.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2005, Tencent announced its intention to follow orders set by [[Shenzhen]] Police and enforce the requirement of real names for all the administrators and founders of QQ Groups. This caused much controversy on whether it can prevent the spread of pornographic and other indecent messages, or whether it intrudes on one's privacy. However, the difficulty of enforcement made the real name registration optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2006-10-19/09321191967.shtml |title=ä¿¡äº§é¨éé¿åå®¢å®åå¶ |publisher=Tech.sina.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resources required to run QQ have increased substantially since it was first released, which has caused some people{{Who|date=June 2011}} to turn to third party &quot;lite&quot; versions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==Q coin==
The Q coin is a [[virtual currency]] used by QQ users to &quot;purchase&quot; QQ related items for their [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] and [[blog]]. Q coins are obtained either by purchase, one coin for one [[Renminbi|RMB]], or for using the mobile phone service. Due to the popularity of QQ among young Chinese, Q coins are now accepted by gradually more and more online stores and gaming sites in exchange for &quot;real&quot; merchandise such as small gifts, and raised the concern of replacing (and thus &quot;inflating&quot;) real currency in these transactions. The [[People's Bank of China]], China's central bank, says it is investigating the possibility of cracking down on Q coin, due to people using Q coins in exchange for real world goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200701/12/eng20070112_340681.html |title=People's Daily Online - Central Bank alert on &quot;virtual money&quot; |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2007-01-12 |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tencent claims the Q coin was merely a regular commodity, and thus not a currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-02/12/content_5730970.htm |title=Virtual currency requires tough new regulations |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modifications==
Coral QQ, a modification of Tencent QQ, is a popular add on. While Tencent charges for some services and displays advertisement, Coral QQ provides free access to some of the services and blocks Tencent's advertisements. In 2006, Tencent filed a copyright lawsuit against Chen Shoufu (aka Soff), the author of Coral QQ, whose redistributing modified Tencent QQ was ruled illegal. Chen then published his modification as a separate add on. On August 16, 2007, Chen was detained again for allegedly making profits off of his ad-blocking add on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119629787148507282.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Debate Over IM Add-Ons in China | first=Juliet | last=Ye | date=November 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His case is pending at Shenzhen Nanshan district court.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==QQ International==
In 2009, QQ began to expand its services internationally, with its IMQQ portal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imqq.com |title=www.imqq.com |publisher=www.imqq.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; working with partners throughout Asia and the USA.

In India, Tencent has partnered with [[ibibo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livemint.com/2008/06/25234912/Ibibo-will-sell-50-to-Tencent.html www.livemint.com/2008/06/25234912/Ibibo-will-sell-50-to-Tencent.html]&lt;/ref&gt; to bring such services as chat, mail and game to the developing Indian internet sphere.

In Vietnam, Tencent has struck a deal with [[VinaGame]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harryd844.wordpress.com/2007/10/29/zing-chat-prepares-to-sword-yahoo-chat/ |title=harryd844.wordpress.com/2007/10/29/zing-chat-prepares-to-sword-yahoo-chat/ |publisher=Harryd844.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to bring the QQ Casual Gaming portal as well as the QQ Messenger as an addition to the already thriving Vietnamese gaming communities.

In the United States, Tencent has partnered with [[AOL]] to bring [[QQ Games]] as a contender in the US social gaming market.  Launched in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.digitaltrends.com/news-article/14367/aol-rolls-out-aim-6-5 |title=news.digitaltrends.com/news-article/14367/aol-rolls-out-aim-6-5 |publisher=News.digitaltrends.com |date=2007-10-03 |accessdate=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; QQ Games comes bundled with the AIM installer, and competes with AOL's own games.com to provide a gaming experience for the AIM user base.

==Web QQ==
Tencent launched its web-based QQ formally on September 15, 2009, the latest version of which being 3.0. Rather than solely a web-based IM, WebQQ 3.0 functions more like its own operating system, with a desktop in which web applications can be added.

===Social network website===
In 2009, Tencent launched Xiaoyou (æ ¡å, 'school friends'), its first social network website, trying to compete with Renren and Kaixin001, the leading Chinese social networks, for students mainly. In mid 2010, Tencent changed direction and replaced Xiaoyou with Pengyou.com (æå, 'friends'), trying to establish a more widespread network, to which extant QQ users could be easily redirected, hence giving Pengyou.com a major advantage over its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tradingstocks.me/renren-ipos-biggest-hurdle-might-be-pengyou/ RenRen IPOâs biggest hurdle might be PengYou], TradingStocks.me, April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open source and cross-platform clients==
Using [[reverse engineering]], open source [[communities]] have come to understand the [[QQ protocol]] better and have attempted to implement client core libraries compatible with more user-friendly clients, free of advertisements. Most of these clients are cross-platform, so they are usable on operating systems which the official client does not support. However, these implementations had only a subset of the functions of the official client and therefore were more limited in features.  Furthermore, QQ's parent company, Tencent, has over successive versions modified the QQ protocol to the extent that it can no longer be supported by most, and perhaps any, of the third-party implementations that were successful in the past (some of which are listed below).  As of 2009, none of the developers of third-party clients have publicised any plans to restore QQ support.
