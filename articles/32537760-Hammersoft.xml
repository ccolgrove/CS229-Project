==History==
{{main|FenerbahÃ§e S.K. seasons}}
{{For|information on a breakdown of FenerbahÃ§e's league and cup history|2011â12 FenerbahÃ§e S.K. season}}
FenerbahÃ§e was founded in 1907 in the province of [[KadÄ±kÃ¶y]] in [[Istanbul]]. The founders were ''Nurizade Ziya Bey ([[Ziya SongÃ¼len]])'', [[Ayetullah Bey]], ''Enver Necip Bey (Enver Necip Okaner).'' This group of individuals founded the club secretly in order to keep a low profile and not get into any trouble with the strict Ottoman rule. So strict in fact that the Sultan, [[Abdul Hamid II]], forbid that the Turkish youth may not set up a club nor engage in the game of football played by the English families that was watched in envy.
[[Ziya SongÃ¼len]] was elected the first president of the club, [[Ayetullah Bey]] became the first General Secretary, and Enver Necip Okaner was given the post of the General Captain.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORY&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/kurumsaldetay.asp?ContentID=6 | title=TarihÃ§e | work=Fenerbahce.org | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[lighthouse]] situated on the FenerbahÃ§e cape was a big influence on the design of the club's first emblem, which sported the yellow and white colors of [[daffodil]]s around the lighthouse. The kits were also designed with yellow and white stripes.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORY&quot; /&gt; The emblem and colors of the club were changed in 1910 when [[Topuz Hikmet]] redesigned the badge and Ziya Bey changed the colors to yellow and navy, still seen today. FenerbahÃ§e's activities were kept in secrecy until a legislation reform in 1908, when, under a new law, all football clubs had to register to exist legally.&lt;ref name=&quot;HISTORY&quot; /&gt; FenerbahÃ§e joined the Istanbul League in 1909, finishing fifth in their first year. The founding line-up included [[Ziya SongÃ¼len]], [[Ayetullah Bey]], Necip Okaner, Galip Kulaksizoglu, Hassan Sami Kocamemi, Asaf Bespinar, Enver Yetiker, Sevkati Hulusi Bey, Fuat HÃ¼snÃ¼ Kayacan, Hamit HÃ¼snÃ¼ Kayacan, and Nasuhi Baydar.&lt;ref name=HIST7&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/kurumsaldetay.asp?ContentID=7 | title=TarihÃ§e â 4. Sayfa | work=Fenerbahce.org | accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenerbahce played against the staff of the [[Royal Navy]] that [[Occupation of Constantinople|occupied Istanbul]] during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. Some British soldiers formed football teams that were named after the players' speciality, for example [[Essex]] [[Engineers]], [[Irish Guards]], [[Grenadiers]], and [[Artillery]]. These teams played against each other and against local football teams in Istanbul. FenerbahÃ§e won many of these matches.&lt;ref name=NAVY&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/d20/tfab/1922/ana.html | title=MÃ¼ttefik Kuvvetler ile Yapilan MaÃ§lar | work=TFAB | accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Turkish Football Federation]] founded a national league in 1959, which continues today under the name of the [[SÃ¼per Lig]]. FenerbahÃ§e won the [[Turkish National League 1959|first tournament]], beating [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] 4â1 on aggregate.&lt;ref name=CHAMP1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/5859/tl.html |title=1959 Milli Lig |work=ErdinÃ§ Sivritepe |accessdate=2007-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, FenerbahÃ§e participated in the [[European Cup 1959â60|Champions League]] for the first time. They qualified through a 4â3 win over [[Csepel SC]]. They lost their first round game to [[OGC Nice]] 1â5 in a playoff game after drawing on aggregate.&lt;ref name=EURO&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec195960.html | title=European Competitions 1959â60 | work=James M. Ross and [[RSSSF]] | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; FenerbahÃ§e became the most successful Turkish club of the 1960s. They were also runners-up three times.&lt;ref name=ARCHIVES&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/artl.html | title=Archives | last=Sivritepe | first=ErdinÃ§ | work=Turkish-soccer.com | accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TSL&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tff.org/default.aspx?pageID=379 | title=TURKCELL SÃPER LIG SAMPIYONLUKLARI | work=TFF.org | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Balkans Cup 1966â67]] (a competition set up for Eastern European clubs from [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]], [[Romania]], [[Turkey]], and [[Yugoslavia]] that existed between the 1960â61 and 1993â94 seasons), FenerbahÃ§e won the cup after three matches against [[Greece|Greek]] club [[AEK Athens FC]], making them the first Turkish club to win a non-domestic competition. This success would remain unparalleled by a Turkish club until [[SarÄ±yer G.K.|SarÄ±yer]] and [[Samsunspor]] won the cup many years later in the 1990s.

The 1970s saw Galatasaray win four more league titles. The decade also saw the first non-Istanbul club and a club outside of FenerbahÃ§e, [[BeÅiktaÅ J.K.|BeÅiktaÅ]], and [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] to win a league title. [[Trabzonspor]] went on to win four titles during the decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSL&quot; /&gt; FenerbahÃ§e won three titles in the 1980s, titles Galatasaray and BeÅiktaÅ dominated the Turkish League during the 1990s, combining to win nine out of 10 ti FenerbahÃ§e's only Turkish League success during the 1990s came in the 1995â1996 season under [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ARCHIVES&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSL&quot; /&gt;
FenerbahÃ§e won the league in 2001, denying Galatasaray a fifth consecutive title. They followed up the next season with a runners-up place behind Galatasaray with new coach [[Werner Lorant]]. The [[SÃ¼per Lig 2002â03|next season]], however, did not go so well as FenerbahÃ§e finished in sixth place with [[Ariel Ortega]] in the squad.&lt;ref name=LIG1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/0203/1.html | title=2002â2003 1.SÃ¼per Lig | work=ErdinÃ§ Sivritepe | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, that season is memorable to many FenerbahÃ§e fans due to a 6-0 win against arch-rivals Galatasaray in [[ÅÃ¼krÃ¼ SaracoÄlu Stadium]] on 6 November 2002.&lt;ref name=6-0&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahcecumhuriyeti.org/Film_Afisleri_6-0.asp | title=6 November Victory | work=fenerbahcecumhuriyeti.org | accessdate=2007-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After firing Werner Lorant, they hired another German coach, [[Christoph Daum]]. Daum had previously coached in Turkey, winning the league with Besiktas in 1994â95. FenerbahÃ§e brought in players including [[Pierre van Hooijdonk|van Hooijdonk]], [[Mehmet AurÃ©lio]], and [[Fabio Luciano]] as a rebuilding process. These new players lead FenerbahÃ§e to their fifteenth title and third star (one being awarded for every 5 league titles won by a club).&lt;ref name=LIG2&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/0304/1.html | title=2003â2004 1.SÃ¼per Lig | work=ErdinÃ§ Sivritepe | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[SÃ¼per Lig 2004â05|next year]] was followed up by a narrow championship over Trabzonspor, winning the then record of sixteen Turkish First Football League championships.&lt;ref name=LIG3&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.angelfire.com/nj/sivritepe/0405/1.html | title=2004â2005 1.SÃ¼per Lig | work=ErdinÃ§ Sivritepe | accessdate=2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; FenerbahÃ§e lost the title in the last week of the [[SÃ¼per Lig 2005â06|2005â06]] season to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]]. FenerbahÃ§e needed a win, but instead drew 1â1 with [[Denizlispor]] while Galatasaray won 3â0 over [[Kayserispor]].

Soon after, [[Christoph Daum]] stepped down as manager,&lt;ref name=DAUM&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/arama.asp?txtSearch=daum&amp;sayfa=2# | title=TesekkÃ¼rlerimizle... | work=Fenerbahce.org | date=2006-06-16 | accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[Zico]] on 4 July 2006.&lt;ref name=ZICO&gt;{{cite web| url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=373241&amp;cc=5739 | title=Zico signs two-year Fenerbahce coaching deal | work=[[ESPN]]soccernet | date=2006-07-04 | accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zico began his reign by signing two new defenders, highly-touted Uruguayan international [[Diego Lugano]], and fellow [[Brazil]]ian [[Edu Dracena]].&lt;ref name=LUGANO&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/detay.asp?ContentID=4433 | title=TÃ¼rkiyeânin en bÃ¼yÃ¼k takimina gidiyorum | work=Fenerbahce.org | date=2006-08-17 | accessdate=2007-05-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EDU&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2006/08/28/2003325300 | title=Dracena to Fenerbahce | work=[[Taipei Times]] | date=2006-08-28 | accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zico also signed two strikers, Serbian international [[Mateja KeÅ¾man]], and another Brazilian, [[Deivid de Souza|Deivid]].&lt;ref name=KEZMAN&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.people.com.cn/200608/29/eng20060829_297735.html | title=Fenerbahce soccer club signs four-year contract with Mateja KeÅ¾man | work=[[People's Daily Online]] | date=2006-08-29 | accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; FenerbahÃ§e's [[SÃ¼per Lig 2006â07|2006â07]] domestic season started off with a 6â0 win over relegation candidates [[Kayseri Erciyesspor]].&lt;ref name=KAYERC&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ligtv.com.tr/MacRaporu.aspx?m=14719 | title=MaÃ§ Raporu | work=LigTV.com.tr | date=2006-08-05 | accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 32&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; week of the [[SÃ¼per Lig 2006â07|SÃ¼per Lig]], FenerbahÃ§e drew Trabzonspor 2â2, while BeÅiktaÅ lost to [[Bursaspor]] 0â3, putting the former out of contention for the title.&lt;ref name=FENTRB&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ligtv.com.tr/MacRaporu.aspx?m=15218 | title=MaÃ§ Raporu | work=LigTV.com.tr | date=2007-05-13 | accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BURBJK&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ligtv.com.tr/MacRapoasdfasfsfasfru.aspx?m=15220 | title=MaÃ§ Raporu | work=LigTV.com.tr | date=2007-05-13 | accessdate=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; FenerbahÃ§e won their seventeenth Turkish SÃ¼per Lig title in [[SÃ¼per Lig 2006â07|2007]], the most in Turkey.&lt;ref name=SEVENTEENTH&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=537891.html | title=FenerbahÃ§e handed Turkish crown | work=[[UEFA]].com | date=2007-05-13 | accessdate=2007-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young Turkish players like [[GÃ¶khan GÃ¶nÃ¼l]], [[Yasin Ãakmak]], [[Ilhan Parlak]], [[Ali Bilgin]], Turkish-English attacker [[Colin Kazim-Richards|KazÄ±m KazÄ±m]], Turkish-Brazilian left back [[GÃ¶kÃ§ek Vederson]] joined FenerbahÃ§e in the beginning of the season and [[Chile national football team]] captain [[Claudio Maldonado]] joined the team in [[List of Turkish football transfers 2007â08|January '08 transfer window]].

On 11 January 2007, FenerbahÃ§e was officially invited to [[G-14]].&lt;ref name=G14&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/eng/detay.asp?ContentID=652 | title=FenerbahÃ§e invited to G-14 | work=Fenerbahce.org | accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; G-14 is an association which consists of top clubs worldwide. FenerbahÃ§e is the only Turkish club that have been invited to this association. On March 2008, FenerbahÃ§e's record application was accepted by [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Records Menagement Team]], which envisages FenerbahÃ§e to have the highest number of medal and trophy achievements on the planet with its 9 branches entirely, total of 1134 cups and medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/spor/futbol/8487765.asp?gid=229&amp;sz=3827 | title=FenerbahÃ§e en fazla kupa kazanan takim| work=hurriyet.com.tr | date=2008-03-18 | accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[1996â97 UEFA Champions League#Group C|UEFA Champions League 1996â97]] season FenerbahÃ§e completed the group stage with seven points&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uefa.com/ competitions/ucl/history/season=1996/round=76/group=17.html | title= UEFA Champions League 1996â97 Season}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, amongst others, beat [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 1â0 in [[Old Trafford]] undoing the record of the English giants being unbeaten for 40 years in their homeground. Under [[Zico]]âs command, [[FenerbahÃ§e]] qualified from the [[UEFA Champions League 2007â08#Group G|UEFA Champions League 2007â08 group stage]] for the first time in the club's history and went on to beat [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] to become a [[UEFA Champions League 2007â08#First knockout round|quarter-finalist in the 2007â08 season]]. So far, [[Zico]] is also the most successful manager of the team's history in the [[UEFA#Competitions|European arena]].
After successful scores both in local league of Turkey and international matches, [[Zico]] gained a new nickname from FenerbahÃ§e fans: ''Kral Arthur (meaning &quot;King Arthur&quot; in Turkish).'' Since 2000, FenerbahÃ§e improved the club's finances and facilities, bringing world stars to the club such as [[Haim Revivo]], [[Ariel Ortega]], [[Serhiy Rebrov]], [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]], [[Alex de Souza]], [[Stephen Appiah]], [[Nicolas Anelka]] and lately [[Mateja KeÅ¾man]], [[Roberto Carlos (footballer)|Roberto Carlos]], and [[Daniel GonzÃ¡lez GÃ¼iza|Dani GÃ¼iza]].

FenerbahÃ§e's [[2009â10 SÃ¼per Lig|2009-10]] season ended in shock as they lost the title on the last day. The FenerbahÃ§e players were told a draw would be enough towards the end of the match only to find out that other games went against their favour as [[Bursaspor]] beat [[BeÅiktaÅ J.K.|BeÅiktaÅ]] 2-1 to get the title. Despite the title loss, FenerbahÃ§e ended the season with the highest number of clean sheets ''(10),'' as well as the joint longest winning streak ''(8).''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whoscored.com/Regions/225/Tournaments/17/Seasons/1919|title=Turkish SÃ¼per Lig 2010 Streaks|publisher=WhoScored.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FenerbahÃ§e won a record 18th  [[SÃ¼per Lig|Turkish League]] title in the [[2010â11 SÃ¼per Lig|2010â11]] season. The team were nine points behind the leaders after 16 games, but went on an unbeaten run of 17 wins and one draw from the last 18 games of the season and won the title with 82 points. [[Trabzonspor]] also finished on 82 points but finished second due head-to-head goal average in favor of FenerbahÃ§e.

In July 2011, [[FenerbahÃ§e S.K.|FenerbahÃ§e fans]] invaded the pitch during a friendly against the Ukrainian champions [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. As punishment, FenerbahÃ§e was sentenced to two [[SÃ¼per Lig|Turkish league]] games in empty [[stadium|stadia]]. The [[Turkish Football Federation|TFF]] later allowed those two games to be filled with spectators; the men were barred while women and children under twelve got in for free. The team plans to have similar promotions during the rest of the season in order to increase attendance and reduce violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/sports/soccer/articles/2011/09/21/turkey_wants_more_women_and_children_at_stadiums/?p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed4 | title=Turkey wants more women and children at stadiums | work=boston.com | date=September 21, 2011 | agency=Press Association | accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[13 November]] [[1918]] British troops entered [[Istanbul]] and invasion was official. During the course of invasion [[United Kingdom|British]] troops arranged football matches with local teams. It still is a policy conducted by troops in foreign lands, considered as a [[P.R.]] thing. [[FenerbahÃ§e S.K.|FenerbahÃ§e]] took place in many games and won 41 of 50 games played and lost only 4 games ended with a draw. [[FenerbahÃ§e S.K.|FenerbahÃ§e]] was secretly moving guns to the [[Anatolia]] meanwhile from its club building near KurbaÄalÄ±dere (''can be translated as Froggy Creek'') by small boats. Also the club's players were going to fronts, fighting against the invading troops, returning to [[Istanbul]] to play games and moving more guns and ammo. [[United Kingdom|The British forces]] realized this as well so they raided the club building but club members got early information about the raid so the guns and ammo were moved and hidden in club members' houses or warehouses. The invasion forces were not able to find anything but they stayed in the club building for days to prevent further action. The head commander of British troops was [[Charles Harington Harington|General Charles Harrington]] and he was quite upset with this progress. He was looking for victory on the pitch as well as the war itself, while [[Turkish people]] were fighting with incredible manner all over the country. It so happened that [[Turkish people|the Turk's]] resistance was finally paying off, invasion forces was strongly pushed back, victories in many fronts by sacrifices of [[Turkish people]] were taking place.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

''&quot;The big three&quot;'' clubs of [[Istanbul]], [[BeÅiktaÅ J.K.|BeÅiktaÅ]], FenerbahÃ§e and [[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]] have a century-long history of rivalry. FenerbahÃ§e-[[Galatasaray S.K.|Galatasaray]] rivalry is the primary [[Istanbul]] derby and the most important rivalry in [[Football in Turkey|Turkish football]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The rivalry has led to violence among supporters on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Turkey to send anti-terror police to Leeds to protect Galatasaray | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/04/17/galatasaray_leeds000417.html| publisher = CBC| date = 2000-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other top level Ä°stanbul derbies include the teams; [[Ä°stanbul BÃ¼yÃ¼kÅehir Belediyespor (football team)|Ä°stanbul BB]] and [[KasÄ±mpaÅa S.K.|KasÄ±mpaÅa]] although these teams pose a minor rivalry as the history and the nation-wide attention to the derbies among the big three is unmatched.

Torches, smoke, drums, flags and giant posters used to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on visiting teams, which fans call ''&quot;welcoming them to hell&quot;.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Galatasaray find new home while 'Hell' rebuilt | url = http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/s874472.htm| publisher = ABC Sport| date = 2003-06-07}} {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club crest and colours==
Since the club's foundation, FenerbahÃ§e has used the same badge, which has only undergone minor alterations. It was designed by [[Topuz Hikmet]]  who played left wing in 1910 and was made by Tevfik Haccar ''(TaÅcÄ±)'' in [[London]]. The emblem consists of five colours. The white section which includes the writing ''FenerbahÃ§e Spor KulÃ¼bÃ¼ 1907'' represents purity and open heartedness, the red section represents love and attachment to the club and symbolises the [[Flag of Turkey|Turkish flag]]. The yellow middle section symbolises admiration and envy, while the navy symbolises nobility. The ''oak acorn'' leaf which rises from the navy and yellow section shows the power of FenerbahÃ§e. The green colour of the leaf shows the success of FenerbahÃ§e is imperative.&lt;ref name=EMBLEM&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fenerbahce.org/eng/kurumsaldetay.asp?ContentID=16 | title=Emblem | work=Fenerbahce.org | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==FenerbahÃ§e Museum==
{{main|FenerbahÃ§e Museum}}
FenerbahÃ§e has a huge leading profile over other clubs concerning trophies. FenerbahÃ§e Spor KulÃ¼bÃ¼ has won many trophies at the currently active branches and at some other branches which have been discontinued. 
During the Turkish War of Independence, FenerbahÃ§e played with many teams of the enemy and injected morale to the Turkish people by winning those games. FenerbahÃ§e Spor KulÃ¼bÃ¼âs football team has many records which are still not broken. Yet the success is not limited only with the football team. At the Olympics, the first gold medal was won  by a FenerbahÃ§e athlete, [[Ruhi SarÄ±alp]], in a field other than wrestling. In athletics, the only club that wins the European Championship is FenerbahÃ§e. To view photos from our museum you should visit our Picture Gallery.
