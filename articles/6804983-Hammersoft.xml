===Existing===
[[Image:TTUcoba.jpg|left|thumb|Building exterior with rotunda]]
The existing Rawls College of Business Building broke ground in [[1966]] and opened in [[1968]]. It has {{convert|200000|sqft|m2}}, 176 offices, and 36 classrooms spread across 13 floors, including a basement. The {{convert|208|ft|m|adj=on}} building is the third-tallest in Lubbock, and the tallest on the [[Campus of Texas Tech University|Texas Tech campus]].&lt;ref&gt;http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2010-08-09/citys-tallest-buildings-wont-face-challenge-years&lt;/ref&gt;
===Future===
[[Image:RCBA REND101607.jpg|thumb|Conceptual drawing of the new building scheduled to open in Spring 2012]]
Construction is underway on a new {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building to replace the current business administration building.  The new facility will house modern classrooms, breakout rooms, student lounges, study areas, food service, and a career management center.

The new building is located on the north end of campus at the previous site of Thompson and Gaston Halls. The building was originally planned to be constructed south of the Merket Alumni Center, but was relocated after complaints from the [[Texas Tech Alumni Association]].&lt;ref&gt;http://lubbockonline.com/stories/051206/loc_051206050.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Other sites considered included the southwest corner of University and Broadway, where Weeks Hall is located.&lt;ref&gt;http://lubbockonline.com/stories/051206/loc_051206050.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The building will be constructed in Spanish Renaissance theme and will create new a north campus gateway.
