&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
=== January&amp;ndash;June ===
* [[January 18]] &amp;ndash; The [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] becomes the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as Elector Frederick III is proclaimed [[Frederick I of Prussia|King Frederick I]].

* [[March 8]] &amp;ndash; [[Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] is created as a north German duchy.
* March &amp;ndash; The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] begins.

[[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] forms the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] with [[Great Britain]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Portugal]], [[Savoy]] and [[Prussia]].  Louis XIV allies [[France]] with [[Spain]] and [[Bavaria]].

Under its terms, [[William III of England|King William III]], childless, would be succeeded by [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]]'s sister [[Anne of Great Britain|Princess Anne]] and her descendants.  If Anne should have no descendants, she would be succeeded by [[Sophia of Hanover]] and her descendants (hence the [[Hanoverian Succession]] in [[1714]]).

=== July&amp;ndash;December ===
* [[July 24]] &amp;ndash; Foundation of a French [[Marketplace|emporium]] named Fort Ponchartrain (later to become [[Detroit, Michigan]]).
* [[August 4]] &amp;ndash; The [[Great Peace of Montreal]] was signed, ending 100 years of war between the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] and [[New France]] and its [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] allies.  Formerly allied with the English, the treaty assured the Iroquois would be neutral if France and England were to ever resume hostilities.
* [[September 6]] &amp;ndash; Death of [[James II of England|King James VII and II]] (1633&amp;ndash;1701) in exile.  His supporters, the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], turn to his son [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (1688&amp;ndash;1766), later called &quot;The Old Pretender&quot;, whom they recognise as James VIII and III.
* [[October 9]] &amp;ndash; The Collegiate School of Connecticut (later renamed [[Yale University]]) is chartered in [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]].

* [[Pierre Antoine Motteux]]'s English translation of the novel ''[[Don Quixote]]'' is first published. Motteux publishes it under the name ''Peter Motteux''.
