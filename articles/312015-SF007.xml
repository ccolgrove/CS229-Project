'''Windows Virtual PC''' (successor to '''Microsoft Virtual PC 2007''', '''Microsoft Virtual PC 2004''', and '''Connectix Virtual PC''') is a [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] program for [[Microsoft Windows]]. In July 2006 Microsoft released the Windows-hosted version as a free product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2006/07/12/662535.aspx
| title = Virtual PC is free!
| date = July 12, 2006
| accessdate = 14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006 Microsoft announced the Macintosh-hosted version would not be ported to Intel-based Macintosh computers, effectively discontinuing the product as PowerPC-based Macintosh computers are no longer manufactured. The newest release, Windows Virtual PC, does not run on versions of Windows earlier than [[Windows 7]], and does not officially run MS-DOS or operating systems earlier than Windows XP SP3 Professional.&lt;ref name=&quot;wvpc-desc&quot; /&gt; The older versions, which support a wider range of host and guest operating systems, remain available.

Virtual PC virtualizes a standard [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] and its associated hardware. Supported Windows operating systems can run inside Virtual PC. Other operating systems such as [[Linux]] may run, but are not officially supported, and Microsoft does not provide the necessary drivers (called &quot;Virtual Machine Additions&quot;) for Linux.&lt;ref name=freecountry&gt;[http://www.thefreecountry.com/emulators/pc.shtml Thefreecountry: Free PC/Intel x86 Emulators and Virtual Machines]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Connectix Virtual PC, Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, and Windows Virtual PC are successive versions of the same software. Windows Virtual PC runs only under Windows 7 and is only designed to run operating systems from XP Professional on, but the earlier Microsoft versions which run under older versions of Windows are still available, and can run operating systems older than Windows XP.

=== Virtual PC by Connectix ===
[[File:Virtual PC 3 for Mac OS running Windows 95.png|thumb|[[Connectix]] Virtual PC version 3 in [[Mac OS 9]], running a [[Brazilian Portuguese]] edition of [[Windows 95]]]]

Virtual PC was originally developed for the Macintosh and released by Connectix in June 1997. The first version of Virtual PC designed for Windows-based systems, version 4.0, was released in June 2001. Connectix sold versions of Virtual PC bundled with a variety of guest operating systems, including Windows, [[OS/2]], and [[Red Hat Linux]]. As virtualization's importance to enterprise users became clear, Microsoft took interest in the sector and acquired Virtual PC and [[Microsoft Virtual Server|Virtual Server]] (unreleased at the time) from Connectix in February 2003.

Earlier versions of Virtual PC supported the following features: (now removed in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, 2007, and Windows Virtual PC):
* Older versions of Virtual PC (v5.0 or earlier) may have the hard disk formatted after creating the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] file. Newer versions must partition and format the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] file manually.
* A ''Virtual Switch'' available in Virtual PC version 4.1 or earlier allows adding multiple network adapters.
* Older operating systems are supported with Virtual Machine additions.
* Older versions of Virtual PC for Macintosh can run on Mac OS 9.2.2 or earlier. Support of Apple [[System 7|System 7.5]] are dropped in version 3.

Under agreement with Connectix, Innotek GmbH (makers of [[VirtualBox]], now part of [[Sun Microsystems]] which is itself owned by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]) ported version 5.0 to run on an OS/2 host.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bityard.com/article.php?sid=100 Innotek/Connectix Virtual PC]&lt;/ref&gt; This version also included guest extensions (VM additions) for OS/2 guests, which could run on Windows, OS/2 or Mac OS X hosts using Virtual PC versions 5, 6 or 7. A new version of the guest extensions was later included with Microsoft's Virtual PC 2004.

[[File:Virtualpc.png|thumb|Virtual PC 6.1 for Macintosh]]
On July 12, 2006, Microsoft released Virtual PC 2004 SP1 for Windows free of charge, but the Mac version was not made free. The equivalent version for Mac, version 7, was the final version of Virtual PC for Mac. It ran on [[Mac OS X]] 10.2.8 or later for [[PowerPC]] and was a [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] [[commercial software]] product.&lt;ref name=&quot;vpc-mac-main&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Virtual PC 2007 was released only for the Windows platform, with public [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] testing beginning October 11, 2006, and production release on February 19, 2007. It added support for [[x86 virtualization|hardware virtualization]], viewing virtual machines on multiple monitors and support for Windows Vista as both host and guest. (The [[Windows Aero]] interface is disabled on Windows Vista guests due to limitations of the emulated video hardware; however, Aero effects can be rendered by connecting to the guest via [[Remote Desktop Connection]] from an Aero-enabled Vista host.)&lt;ref name=aero_savill/&gt;

On May 15, 2008, Microsoft released Virtual PC 2007 Service Pack 1, which added support for both Windows XP SP3 and Vista SP1 as guest and host OSes, as well as [[Windows Server 2008]] Standard as a guest OS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/journals/microsoft.ars/2008/05/15/microsoft-drops-some-details-on-upcoming-virtual-pc-2007-sp1 Microsoft releases Virtual PC 2007 SP1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Virtual PC 2007 SP1 Release Notes | publisher = Microsoft | date = 2008-05-15 | url = http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9f3d3eb5-5e03-4712-999c-e96f91bdf128&amp;displaylang=en | accessdate = 2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hotfix]] rollup for Virtual PC 2007 SP1, released February 20, 2009, solved networking issues and enhanced the maximum screen resolution to 2048Ã1920 (32-bit),&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958162 KB958162]&lt;/ref&gt; enabling 16:9 resolutions such as 1920Ã1080. A security update was released on 14 July 2009 to address an elevation of privilege vulnerability in guest operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS09-033.mspx MS09-033]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emulated environment ==
Virtual PC emulates the following environments:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Microsoft.com|title=Overview of the technical specifications of virtual machines in Virtual PC 2004|date=2004-10-27|accessdate=2010-05-23|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/833144}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Intel]] [[Pentium II]] ([[32-bit]]) processor (but virtualizes the host processor on Windows versions) with an [[Intel]] [[Intel 440BX|440BX]] chipset.
* Standard [[SVGA]] [[VESA]] [[graphics card]] ([[S3 Trio]] 32 [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] with 4 [[megabyte|MB]] [[video RAM]], adjustable in later versions up to 16&amp;nbsp;MB by manually editing a virtual machine's settings file).
* System [[BIOS]] from [[American Megatrends]] (AMI).
* [[Creative Labs]] [[Sound Blaster]] 16 [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] [[Plug and Play|PnP]]. (When Vista is installed as both the host (main) and guest (virtual) operating systems, settings are synchronized with the host and audio configuration is not required.)
* [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] 21041 (DEC 21140 in newer versions) [[Ethernet]] [[computer network|network]] card.
* Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 and earlier do not have the ability to redirect USB devices to the guest machine, although devices connected to the host OS via USB can be used as normal by Virtual PC{{Clarify|date=November 2010}}.
* Programs using undocumented features of hardware, exotic timings, or unsupported [[opcodes]] may not work.

Implementation:
* The [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] version of Virtual PC uses [[dynamic recompilation]] to translate the [[x86]] code used by PCs into equivalent [[PowerPC]] code for Macs.
* The Windows version of Virtual PC also uses dynamic recompilation, but only to translate x86 [[kernel mode]] and [[real mode]] code into x86 [[user mode]] code; original user mode and [[virtual 8086 mode]] code run natively.
* Guest call traps are used, especially for guest extensions, to accelerate emulation or offer additional features, such as integration with the host environment.
* Virtual PC and [[Microsoft Virtual Server|Virtual Server]] encapsulate virtual hard disks in the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] (VHD) file format, for which Microsoft has made all documentation available under the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise|Open Specification Promise]].

Earlier versions of Virtual PC supported the following features: (now removed in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004, 2007, and Windows Virtual PC):
* Older versions of Virtual PC (v5.0 or earlier) may have the hard disk formatted after creating the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] file. Newer versions must partition and format the [[VHD (file format)|Virtual Hard Disk]] file manually.
* A ''Virtual Switch'' available in Virtual PC version 4.1 or earlier allows adding multiple network adapters.
* Older operating systems are supported with Virtual Machine additions.
* Older versions of Virtual PC for Macintosh can run on Mac OS 9.2.2 or earlier. Support of Apple [[System 7|System 7.5]] was dropped in version 3.

== Virtual machine integration components ==
Windows Virtual PC may enable guest operating systems running inside virtual machines to interact with their host operating system beyond what is feasible between two physical computers, such as sharing physical hardware components or exchanging data. To do so however, ''integration components'' must be installed on the guest operating systems. When no integration component is installed, the only mean of communicating between two machines (either virtual or physical) is through a virtual network interface. Even the mouse cursor can only be controlled by one operating system (either real or virtual) at any given time. However, once the Integration Components are installed on the guest operating systems, the following features are automatically activated:&lt;ref name = &quot;UMVS2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

* Mouse cursor sharing: Mouse cursor can be move freely between the machines.
* Host-initiated shutdown: Virtual machine can be shut down, restarted or put into standby or hibernation via a set of [[API]] functions.
* Time synchronization: The virtual machine's clock will be automatically synchronized with the host operating system's clock.
* Process responsiveness monitoring: Host operating system will be able to detect whether the software on the guest operating system is responsive or hung.
* Dynamic screen resolution: The screen resolution of the guest operating system can simply be changed by resizing the window into which it is running.

In addition to features described above, guest operating systems may also take advantage of the following integration features but only when the administrator activates them:&lt;ref name = &quot;UMVS2&quot; /&gt;
* Audio sharing: Audio played on the guest operating system may be brought to the host operating system and played on it.
* Clipboard sharing: Contents such as text, picture or everything that is cut or copied to [[Clipboard (software)|Windows Clipboard]] maybe pasted in other machines.
* Printer sharing: Guest operating systems may print on the host operating system's printer . This feature should not be confused with File and Printer Sharing over an emulated network connection.
* Smart card sharing: [[Smart card]]s connected to host operating system may be accessed on guest operating systems.
* File sharing: Windows Virtual PC can also share [[disk partition]]s and [[disk drive]]s of the host operating system with guest operating systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;DnD-unsupported&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Volume-sharing&quot; /&gt; This includes USB mass storage devices that are connected later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Windows Virtual PC, enabling integration features automatically makes the virtual machine user account accessible using [[Remote Desktop Connection]].&lt;ref name = &quot;UMVS2&quot; /&gt;

== Supported host and guest operating systems {{Anchor|Host operating systems}} {{Anchor|Guest operating systems}} ==

Virtual PC allows multiple guest operating systems to run virtualized on a single physical host. Although a number of popular host and guest operating systems lack official Microsoft support, there are sometimes few, if any, technical obstacles impeding installation. Instead, a configuration may be unsupported due to Microsoft's own [[EULA|licensing]] restrictions,&lt;ref name=bergstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=vista_eula_orig/&gt; or a decision to focus testing and support resources elsewhere, especially when production use of a [[Legacy software#Legacy support|legacy]] product fades.&lt;ref name=vguy_win95/&gt;&lt;ref name=vguy_dosadd/&gt;

A program manager on Microsoft's core virtualization team explains what official support entails:
{{quote|With each release of Virtual PC we spend a significant amount of time trying to decide which (guest) operating system should be officially supported.  While Virtual PC is capable of running many operating systems, official support for an operating system means that we will test it thoroughly, not ship Virtual PC if an issue exists with that operating system, and provide full support for customers who encounter problems while running these operating systems under Virtual PC.&lt;ref name=vguy_win95&gt;{{cite web | last = Armstrong | first = Ben | title = Why won't the Virtual PC 2007 Virtual Machine Additions load on Windows 95? | work = [http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/ Virtual PC Guy's Weblog] | publisher = [[MSDN Blogs]] | date = 2007-01-03 | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2007/01/03/why-won-t-the-virtual-pc-2007-virtual-machine-additions-load-on-windows-95.aspx | accessdate = 2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Ben Armstrong, &quot;Virtual PC Guy&quot;}}

=== Linux guests {{Anchor|Emulating Linux-based environments}} ===

Installing a Linux-based guest environment in Virtual PC is possible.  RedHat and SuSe Linux guests are supported.

Some [[Linux distribution]]s must be installed in text mode, as they do not support Microsoft Virtual PC's emulated graphics chip.  [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 8.10 ([[Intrepid Ibex]]) must be installed in SafeMode, but does not require other changes.

Some websites specialize in listing operating systems that run successfully as Virtual PC guests, to help users avoid issues when installing Linux distributions or other operating systems lacking official Microsoft support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vpc.visualwin.com/ What Works and What Doesn't in Microsoft Virtual PC 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microsoft]] announced on August 7, 2006, that Virtual PC for Mac would not be ported to the [[AppleâIntel architecture|Intel Mac]] platform. Microsoft stated, &quot;Alternative solutions offered by Apple and other vendors, combined with a fully packaged retail copy of Windows, will satisfy this need.&quot;&lt;ref name=wwdc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/08/07/vpc/index.php |title=WWDC: Microsoft kills Virtual PC for Mac |publisher=MacWorld |date=2006-08-07 |accessdate=2007-10-08 |last=Cohen |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar products available at the time were [[Parallels Desktop]] and [[VMware Fusion]].
