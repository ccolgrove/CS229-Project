== Fluendo Group ==
* From Fluendo projects, two new companies have been created with specific roles :
** [[Flumotion|Flumotion Services S.A.]] is leveraging the Flumotion Streaming server (development started at Fluendo) as a [[Content Delivery Network|service platform]] but also as a [[Independent software vendor|software]].
** [[Fluendo Embedded S.L.]] develops [[Moovida]] (formerly Elisa) open source [[media player]] that is based on [[Banshee (media player)|Banshee]] and [[GStreamer]].

== Projects sponsored by Fluendo ==
* [[GStreamer]], framework for multimedia application development. Fluendo developed the 0.10.x series which are widely used in today's Linux distributions.
* [[Pitivi]], a non linear video editor for the [[Free Software]] desktop. Fluendo hired the lead developer of that project for two years.
* [[Cortado (software)|Cortado]], an open source [[Java applet]] featuring a lightweight implementation of [[GStreamer]] in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with royalty free codecs like [[Theora]] and [[Vorbis]]. This applet allows content producers to use royalty free formats without worrying about the end user media player capabilities.
* [[Theora]], a royalty free codec. Fluendo funded the Xiph Foundation for enhancing and fixing Theora implementation so that it becomes usable for production environments.
* [[Theora]] and [[Vorbis]] [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]] specifications. Streaming using royalty-free codecs with the RTP protocol was something the community needed. Fluendo funded that project.
* [[MP3]] codec made available at no cost for Linux and Solaris desktop users.
* [[Pigment (software)|Pigment]] a 3D scene graph library designed to easily create rich application user interfaces.  Pigment includes fully supported [[Python (programming language)|Python]] bindings.
