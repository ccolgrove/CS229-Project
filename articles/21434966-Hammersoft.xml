The '''history of the bikini''' is a checkered one. Though the [[bikini]] shocked when it appeared on French beaches in 1947, its origins date back millennia. Depictions of bikini-like garments appear at the [[Chalcolithic]] site of [[ÃatalhÃ¶yÃ¼k]], and two-piece bikini-like garments were worn by women for athletic purposes in [[Ancient Greece]] as far back as 1400 BC. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] mosaic artwork in [[Sicily]], dubbed &quot;Bikini Girls&quot; and dating back to the reign of [[Diocletian]] (286-305 AD) gained significant archeological renown, and Roman statues of [[Aphrodite|Venus]] in a bikini were found elsewhere. In the modern era, the first functional two-piece swimsuit was designed in 1913 by [[Carl Jantzen]]. Australian swimmer-performer [[Annette Kellerman]] was arrested in 1907 for wearing a two-piece. Later it was made popular by [[pin-up girl]]s like swimmer-actress [[Esther Williams]], and actresses [[Ava Gardner]], [[Rita Hayworth]], and [[Lana Turner]].

The modern bikini was invented by [[France|French]] engineer [[Louis RÃ©ard]] in 1946. He named it after [[Bikini Atoll]] in the Pacific, the site of an [[Operation Crossroads|atomic bomb test]] on July 1, 1946. RÃ©ard hoped that the burst of excitement it caused would be as explosive as an atomic bomb. Since his contemporary [[Jacques Heim]] had called his bikini precursor the ''Atome'' in view of its size, RÃ©ard claimed to have &quot;split the ''Atome''&quot; to make it even smaller. His innovation was to expose the navel, which was not done in earlier two-piece bathing costumes. Though a moderate hit in France, it was not well accepted in other parts of the world. The [[Miss World]] contest in UK, the [[United States Motion Picture Production Code of 1930|Hays production code]] in the US, and the [[Roman Catholicism by country|Catholic countries]] banned the costume. But, the advent of bikinis in popular media, including [[Ursula Andress]]'s [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]] in ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No.]]'', [[Brian Hyland]]'s song &quot;[[Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini]]&quot;, and the [[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]], eventually gained social acceptance for the bikini. By the early 2000s, bikinis had become a US$811 million business annually, and boosted spin-off services like [[bikini waxing]] and the [[sun tanning]] industries. Further variants were added to the bikini family of beachwears and bathing costumes, contributing to the popular lexicon a variety of ''-kini''s and ''-ini''s.

In the [[Chalcolithic]] era around 5600 BC, the mother-goddess of [[ÃatalhÃ¶yÃ¼k]], a large ancient settlement in southern [[Anatolia]], was depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini.&lt;ref name=PKumar&gt;Prithvi Kumar Agrawala, ''Goddessess in Ancient India'', page 12, Abhinav Publications, 1984, ISBN 0-391-02960-6&lt;/ref&gt; Two-piece garments worn by women for athletic purposes are depicted on Greek [[urn]]s and paintings dating back to 1400 BC.&lt;ref name=IndeR&gt;{{cite news |first=Rupert |last=Cornwell |coauthors=John Lichfield |title= Boom and Bust: The nuclear age and the bikini age |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/boom-and-bust-the-nuclear-age-and-the-bikini-age-404390.html |work= |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=17 June 2006 |accessdate=30 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Active women of ancient Greece wore a [[bandeau|breastband]] called a ''mastodeton'' or an ''apodesmos'', which continued to be used as an undergarment in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Pedersen, ''Bra'', page 8, David &amp; Charles, 2004, ISBN 0-7153-2067-X&lt;/ref&gt; While men in ancient Greece abandoned the ''perizoma'', partly high-cut [[briefs]] and partly loincloth, women performers and acrobats continued to wear it.&lt;ref&gt;Larissa Bonfante, ''Etruscan Dress'', page 21, JHU Press, 2003, ISBN 0-8018-7413-0&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PiazzaArmerina-Mosaik-Bikini.jpg|thumb|left|200px|One of the earliest visual documentations of a bikini, from the Ancient Roman [[Villa Romana del Casale]]]]

Artwork dating back to the [[Diocletianic Persecution|Diocletian period]] (286-305 AD) in [[Villa Romana del Casale]], [[Sicily]], excavated by [[Gino Vinicio Gentile]] in 1950-60, depicts women in garments resembling bikinis in [[mosaic]]s on the floor.&lt;ref name=BBCW/&gt;&lt;ref name=VilCas&gt;[http://www.valdinoto.com/english/villa_romana_del_casale.htm Villa Romana del Casale], Val di Noto&lt;/ref&gt; The images of ten women, dubbed the &quot;Bikini Girls&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Allen Guttmann, ''Women's Sports: A History'', page 38, Columbia University Press, 1991, ISBN 0-231-06957-X&lt;/ref&gt; exercising in clothing that would pass as bikinis today, are the most replicated mosaic among the 37 million colored tiles at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/villaromanadelcasale.html Villa Romana del Casale], World Heritage Sites&lt;/ref&gt; In the artwork &quot;Coronation of the Winner&quot; done in floor mosaic in the Chamber of the Ten Maidens (''Sala delle Dieci Ragazze'' in Italian&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Porter &amp; Danforth Prince, ''Frommer's Sicilyâ'', page 272, Frommer's, 2007, ISBN 0-470-10056-7&lt;/ref&gt;) the bikini girls are depicted weight-lifting, discus throwing, and running.

[[Charles Seltman]], a fellow of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]], curator of the Archaeology Museum there and an editor of ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', illustrated a chapter titled &quot;The new woman&quot; in his book ''Women in Antiquity'' with a 1950s model wearing an identical bikini against the 4th-century mosaics from [[Piazza Armerina]] as part of a sisterhood between the bikini-clad female athletes of ancient Greco-Romans and modern woman. A photograph of the mosaic was used by [[Sarah Pomeroy]], Professor of Classics at [[Hunter College]] and the [[CUNY Graduate Center|Graduate Center, City University of New York]], in the 1994 British edition of her book ''Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves'' to emphasize a similar identification.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Huskinson, ''Experiencing Rome'', pages 162-163, Routledge, 2000, ISBN 0-415-21284-7&lt;/ref&gt; According to archeologist [[George M.A. Hanfmann]] the bikini girls made the learned observers realize &quot;how modern the ancients were&quot;.&lt;ref name=hanfmann&gt;George Maxim Anossov Hanfmann, ''Roman Art: A Modern Survey of the Art of Imperial Rome'', page XXV, New York Graphic Society, 1964, ASIN B001826ZJO&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venus in Bikini.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Venus]] in bikini from the [[house of Julia Felix]], [[Pompeii]]]]

In ancient [[Roman Empire|Rome]], the bikini-style bottom, a wrapped [[loincloth]] of cloth or leather, was called a ''subligar'' or ''[[subligaculum]]'' (&quot;little binding underneath&quot;), while a band of cloth or leather to support the breasts was called ''strophium'' or ''mamillare''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara F. McManus, [http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/clothing.html Roman Clothing], The College of New Rochelle, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The exercising bikini girls from Piazza Armenia wear ''subligaria'', scanty briefs made as a dainty version of a man's ''perizoma'', and a ''strophium'' band about the breasts, often referred to in literature as just ''fascia'', which can mean any kind of bandage. Observation of artifacts and [[Experimental archaeology|experiments]] shows bands had to be wrapped several times around the breasts, largely to flatten them in a style popular with [[flapper]]s in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=RomCost&gt;Judith Lynn Sebesta &amp;, Larissa Bonfante, ''The World of Roman Costume'', pages 234-235, Wisconsin Press, 1994, ISBN 0-299-13854-2&lt;/ref&gt; These Greco-Roman [[Bandeau|breastband]]s may have flattened big breasts and padded small breasts to look bigger. Evidence suggests regular use.&lt;ref name=LizCle&gt;Liza Cleland, Glenys Davies &amp; Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, ''Greek and Roman Dress from A to Z'', Routledge, 2007, ISBN 0-415-22661-9&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;bikini girls&quot; from Piazza Armenia, some of whom sport the braless look of the late 20th century, do not depict any propensity of such popularity in style.&lt;ref name=RomCost/&gt; One bottom, made of leather, from [[Roman Britain]] was displayed at the [[Museum of London]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=AlWer&gt;Alex Werner, &quot;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-54879248.html Bodies at the Museum of London]&quot;, ''[[History Today]]'', 1998-11-01&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no evidence that these bikinis were for swimming or [[Sun tanning|sun-bathing]].&lt;ref&gt;Liza Cleland, Glenys Davies &amp; Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, ''Greek and Roman Dress from A to Z'', page 19, Routledge, 2007, ISBN 0-415-22661-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Finds especially in [[Pompeii]] show the Roman goddess [[Venus]] wearing a bikini. A statue of Venus in a bikini was found in a cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found in the front hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/gallery/allison Pompeian Households], [http://www.stoa.org/gallery/albums.php Stoa Image Gallery], [http://www.stoa.org/ The Stoa Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Venus was recovered from the ''[[tablinum]]'' of the [[house of Julia Felix]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard &amp; John Henderson, ''Classical Art'', page 116, Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 0-19-284237-4&lt;/ref&gt; and another from an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] in the garden at [[House of Loreius Tiburtinus|Via Dell'Abbondanza]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth B.

They found them so shocking that for long periods the secret chamber was opened only to &quot;mature persons of secure morals&quot;. Even after the doors were opened, only 20 visitors were to be admitted at a time, and children under 12 were not allowed into the new part of the museum without their parents' or a teacher's permission.&lt;ref name=BBCS/&gt;

There are references to bikinis in ancient literature as well. [[Ovid]], the writer ranked alongside [[Virgil]] and [[Horace]] as one of the three canonical poets of [[Latin literature]], suggests the breastband or long strip of cloth wrapped around the breasts and tucked in the ends, is a good place to hide love-letters.&lt;ref name=LizCle/&gt; [[Martial]], a [[Latin]] poet from [[Hispania]] who published between AD 86 and 103, satirized a female athlete he named Philaenis, who played ball in a bikini-like garb quite bluntly, making her drink, gorge and vomit in abundance and hinting at her [[lesbian]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Crompton, '' Homosexuality &amp; Civilization'', page 98, Harvard University Press, 2006, ISBN 0-674-02233-5&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[epigram]] on [[Chione (daughter of Daedalion)|Chione]], Martial strangely mentions a sex worker who went to the [[Roman Baths (Bath)|bathhouse]] in a bikini, while it was more natural to go unclothed.&lt;ref&gt;Martial, Lindsay Watson &amp; Patricia A. Watson, ''Select Epigrams'', page 189, Cambridge University Press, 2003, ISBN 0-521-55539-6&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], the 6th century empress of the [[Byzantine Empire]] wore a bikini when she appeared as an actress before she captured the heart of emperor [[Justinian I]].&lt;ref name=hanfmann/&gt;

The modern bikini has had a checkered history. The first domestic swimsuit for &quot;decency&quot; appeared in 1830. Featuring red and white horizontal stripes from ankle to wrist, it was nicknamed the &quot;prison suit&quot;.&lt;ref name=notting&gt;David Sandhu, &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/728059/Nottingham-Bathed-in-nostalgia.html Nottingham: Bathed in nostalgia]&quot;, ''The Telegraph'' (UK), 2003-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, Australian swimmer and performer [[Annette Kellerman]] was arrested on a [[Boston]] beach for wearing a form-fitting one-piece although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women by 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Conor, ''The spectacular modern woman: feminine visibility in the 1920sâ'', page 152, Indiana University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-253-34391-7&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures of her were produced as evidence in the ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire magazine]]'' versus [[United States Postmaster General]] legal battle over indecency in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Preer, &quot;[http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/1990/spring/esquire-v-walker-3.html The Postmaster General and ''The Magazine for Men'']&quot;, ''Prologue Magazine'', page 3, Spring 1990, Vol. 23, No. 1, U.S. National Archives and Records Administration&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, inspired by the introduction of females into Olympic swimming, the designer [[Carl Jantzen]] made the first functional two-piece swimwear, a close-fitting one-piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml|accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=American Heritage Inc.|title=60 Years of Bikinis|author=Hoover, Elizabeth D.|date=5 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silent films such as ''[[The Water Nymph]]'' (1912) saw [[Mabel Normand]] in revealing attire, and this was followed by the daringly dressed [[Sennett Bathing Beauties]] (1915â1929).

By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away. Hollywood endorsed the new glamour with films such as ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' in which [[Esther Williams]] wore provocatively named costumes such as &quot;Double Entendre&quot; and &quot;Honey Child&quot;.&lt;ref name=notting/&gt; Williams also portrayed Kellerman in the 1952 film ''[[Million Dollar Mermaid]]'' (titled as ''The One Piece Bathing Suit'' in UK).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Anzovin &amp; Janet Podell, ''Famous First Facts'', page 51, H.W.

The modern bikini was introduced by French engineer [[Louis RÃ©ard]] and separately by fashion designer [[Jacques Heim]] in Paris in 1946.

It comprised two pieces, the bottom large enough to cover its wearer's navel. In May 1946, he advertised it as the world's &quot;smallest bathing suit&quot;.

For women, wearing a bikini signaled a kind of second liberation. There was really nothing sexual about this.

But sales did not pick up around the world as women stuck to traditional two-piece swimsuits. RÃ©ard went back to designing orthodox knickers to sell in his motherâs shop.&lt;ref name=TimA/&gt; Actresses in movies like ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' (1947) and the model on a 1948 cover of ''LIFE'' were shown in traditional two-piece swimwear, not the bikini. In 1950, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine interviewed American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, owner of [[Cole of California]], and reported that he had &quot;little but scorn for Franceâs famed Bikinis,&quot; because they were designed for &quot;diminutive Gallic women&quot;. &quot;French girls have short legs,&quot; he explained, &quot;Swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer.&quot; One writer described it as a &quot;two-piece bathing suit which reveals everything about a girl except for her mother's maiden name.&quot;&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; According to Kevin Jones, curator and fashion historian at the [[Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising]], &quot;RÃ©ard was ahead of his time by about 15 to 20 years.

==Controversies==
===The &quot;body ideal&quot;===
In the 1960s Emily Post decreed, &quot;(A bikini) is for perfect figures only, and for the very young.&quot; In ''[[The Bikini Book]]'' by [[Kelly Killoren Bensimon]], responding to a question on who should not wear a bikini, swimwear designer [[Norma Kamali]] says, &quot;Anyone with a tummy.&quot; Since then, a number of bikini designers including [[Malia Mills]] have encouraged women of all ages and body types to take up the style. The 1970s saw the rise of the lean ideal of female body and figures like [[Cheryl Tiegs]] possessed the figure that remains in vogue today. The fitness boom of the 1980s led to one of the biggest leaps in the evolution of the bikini. According to swimwear designer Malia Mills, &quot;The leg line became superhigh, the front was superlow, and the straps were superthin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilith-ezine.com/articles/2006/The-Bikini.html The Bikini turns 60! from the Lilith Gallery of Toronto].

===Cultural controversies===
In 1996, when the Miss World contest was held in [[Bangalore]], India, dozens of Indian groups opposed the event claiming that the contest degraded women by featuring them in bikinis. Social activist Subhashini Ali commented, &quot;It's not an IQ test. Neither is it a charity show. It's a beauty contest in which these things have been added on as sops.&quot; The protests were so intense that the organizers were finally compelled to shift the venue of the &quot;Swimsuit Round&quot; to [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref&gt;News Desk, [http://web.archive.org/web/20031217161734/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/23/miss.world/index.html Miss Greece now Miss World, despite pageant protests], CNN, 1996-11-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anita Pratap, [http://web.archive.org/web/20030404132350/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/22/india.miss.world/index.html Indian police prepare for worst in beauty pageant clash], CNN, 1996-11-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anita Pratap, [http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9611/17/miss.world/index.html Beauty pageant in India becomes a contest of wills], CNN, 1996-11-17&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan [[Miss Earth]] 2003 contestant [[Vida Samadzai]] (born in Afghanistan, raised in USA and living in India&lt;ref name=Fida&gt;Ayesha Matthan, &quot;[http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/12/18/stories/2007121850150600.htm Fida over Vida]&quot;, ''The Hindu'', 2007-12-18&lt;/ref&gt;) was severely condemned by the both the Afghan authority and community.&lt;ref name=Gersh&gt;Gersh Kuntzman, &quot;[http://gershkuntzman.homestead.com/files/Beauty_is_a_Beast.htm Beauty is a Beast]&quot;, ''Newsweek'', 2003-11-03&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Afghan Supreme Court]], banning such contests, said that appearing naked in beauty contests is totally un-Islamic, and is against Afghan tradition, human honour and dignity.

===Health aspects===
Alongside controversies about the body ideal projected by the bikini and various cultural issues, there also is a concern about excess exposure of the skin to sun and the health hazards involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;menkes&quot; /&gt;
