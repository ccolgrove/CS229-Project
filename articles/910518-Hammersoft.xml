The '''Empire of Atlantium''' is a [[micronation]] and [[secular]],
[[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] [[Progressivist|progressive]] lobby group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Links|url=http://www.usns.info/links.html|accessdate=2008-01-15|publisher=Unrecognised States Numismatic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

''[[Micronations: The Lonely Planet Guide to Home-Made Nations]]'' describes Atlantium as &quot;a refreshing antidote to the reactionary self-aggrandisement of so many micronations&quot;, and &quot;an extremely sophisticated nation-state experiment, as well as an entirely serious claimant to legitimate statehood&quot;. The book's entry on Atlantium notes its espousal of &quot;progressive, liberal policies&quot; and characterizes it as a &quot;secular humanist utopia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;John2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Micronations|author=John Ryan, George Dunford &amp; Simon Sellars|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|year=2006|isbn=1-74104-730-7|pages=74-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the causes Atlantium supports are the right to unrestricted international [[freedom of movement]], the right to [[abortion]], the right to [[Consensual homicide|assisted suicide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantium.org/constitution.html |title=Constitution of Atlantium |accessdate=2008-01-26 |publisher=Empire of Atlantium}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[decimal calendar]] reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decimaltime.hynes.net/calendar.html#annusnovus |title= Decimal Time&amp;nbsp;â Calendars&amp;nbsp;â Annus Novus Decimal Calendar |accessdate=2008-01-30 |publisher=John D Hynes |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080602063606/http://decimaltime.hynes.net/calendar.html#annusnovus &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Atlantium was established in 1981 by three [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] teenagers&amp;nbsp;â George Francis Cruickshank, Geoffrey John Duggan and Claire Marie Coulter (nÃ©e Duggan). The three claimed a {{convert|10|m2|sqft}} Provisional Territory in the southern suburb of [[Narwee, New South Wales|Narwee]] as Atlantium's first capital, and declared Cruickshank to be Sovereign Head of State, with  the title &quot;Emperor George II&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historyof&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantium.org/history.html |title=History of Atlantium |accessdate=2008-01-26 |publisher=Empire of Atlantium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geoffrey Duggan (1982â1986) was elected as prime minister. Damian Scott (1986â1988), and Kevin Fanucchi (1988â1990) also served as prime ministers, but by 1990, when the original group members had graduated from university and moved to different locations, the group ceased to be active.

In 1999 Cruickshank purchased an apartment in the inner Sydney suburb of [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], and soon after revived Atlantium, launching a [[website]], which was instrumental in attracting new members. The {{convert|61|m2|sqft}} apartment, known as the Imperium Proper, became the second capital of Atlantium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Historyof&quot; /&gt; Concordia became the third capital of Atlantium on 12 January 2008, when the rural {{convert|0.76|km2|sqmi}} Province of Aurora, approximately {{convert|350|km|mi}} southwest of Sydney, was created. The Atlantium website describes Aurora as Atlantium's &quot;global administrative capital, ceremonial focal point and spiritual homeland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Province of Aurora|url=http://www.atlantium.org/territoryaurora.html|accessdate=2008-01-15|publisher=Empire of Atlantium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aurora==

The Province of Aurora covers {{convert|0.76|km2|sqmi}} and has a fenced {{convert|4.5|km|mi}} long perimeter. It is divided into four &quot;administrative divisions&quot;, known as the District of Hickey (which occupies approximately half of Aurora's total area), the District of Duggan (which occupies the southern third of the province), Concordia Capital District (the only administrative division in which permanent human occupancy and development is permitted) and the Prefecture of Idalia (the re-named former Imperium Proper). The latter is the current permanent residence of Emperor George II.

Concordia is the intended location of facilities to house Atlantium's legislature, government offices, museum, throne hall and commemorative monuments. Currently it is the location of a single-storey residential and administrative building, several service structures, and two small man-made lakes. Aurora is also the site of an historic gold processing facility built and operated in the 1860s by [[China|Chinese]] immigrant miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantium.org/territoryaurora.html |title=Province of Aurora |accessdate=2008-01-26 |publisher=Empire of Atlantium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status and operations==

The Atlantium website uses several different self-descriptions, including &quot;self-declared state&quot;, &quot;aspirant [[microstate]]&quot; and &quot;global sovereign state&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empire of Atlantium|url=http://www.atlantium.org|accessdate=2008-01-15|publisher=Empire of Atlantium}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with its claim to be a &quot;primarily non-territorial&quot; state Atlantium does not maintain any formal territorial claims; however, it does promote the idea that Cruickshank's apartment, and the Province of Aurora, have [[extraterritorial]] status; in practice these properties remain under Australian [[jurisdiction]].

No established nation has recognised Atlantium's sovereignty claims, and it has no reciprocal diplomatic relations. Atlantium has appointed &quot;unaccredited diplomatic representatives&quot; called &quot;Imperial Legates&quot; in the [[United States]], [[Pakistan]], [[Poland]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Italy]], [[Iran]], [[Singapore]], [[Serbia]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Empire of Atlantium|author=Charles Green|work=Cabinet Magazine|year=2005|url=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/18/blackson4.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has awarded &quot;Imperial Honours&quot; to various recipients, generally in recognition of political activism or for service to local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Empire of Atlantium|title=Imperial News Service|url=http://www.atlantium.org/news.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stamps, coins and banknotes==
Stamps, coins and banknotes are sold by Atlantium, which utilises a decimal currency system of 100 Imperial Centi to the Imperial Solidus. Atlantium's website claims that the profits from those sales are used for &quot;the Empire's ongoing operations&quot; as well as charitable causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.atlantium.org/faq.html|accessdate=2008-01-15|publisher=Empire of Atlantium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stamps===
The earliest documented media report referring to Atlantium is a 1984 philatelic magazine article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Atlantium Empire|author=Bill Hornadge|work=[[Stamp News]]|date=September 1984|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; about its [[Philatelic fakes and forgeries#Cinderellas|cinderella stamp]] releases. There are currently 12 issues of Atlantian stamps, and a monthly postal service between Concordia and Idalia will commence in the second half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Province of Aurora|url=http://www.atlantium.org/territoryaurora.html|accessdate=2008-01-30|publisher=Empire of Atlantium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coins===
Atlantium mints coins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Empire Strikes a Coin|author=John Mulhall|work=The Australasian Coin &amp; Banknote Magazine|date=July 2002|url=http://www.usns.info/pdf/Australian_Coin_Banknote_072002.pdf|format=PDF}}
&lt;/ref&gt; though the levels of Atlantian economic activity remain low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Finance|publisher=Empire of Atlantium|accessdate=2008-01-30|url=http://www.atlantium.org/finance.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the 20th anniversary 10 Solidi coin has been minted in the past, which has a likeness of George Cruickshank as the obverse and the Imperial Eagle as the reverse.

==Membership==

As of 2006, the group reportedly had 903 &quot;citizens&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;John2006&quot; /&gt; in over 90 countries. The website names just over 20 individuals holding such functions as [[Minister (government)|minister]], director, magister and imperial legate. Atlantium says its [[citizenship]] does not supersede previously existing citizenships. Atlantians contend that they are all dual-citizens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantium.org/state.html|title=Ministry of State |accessdate=2008-01-26 |publisher=Empire of Atlantium}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Atlantium actively encourages its members to participate in the political processes of their resident countries. While the group uses the words &quot;citizenship&quot; and &quot;[[Diplomacy|diplomatic]]&quot; [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratically]], supporters note that Atlantium has made no secret of its attempts at redefining existing paradigms, and claim that doing so is a fundamental motivation for the group's existence.
