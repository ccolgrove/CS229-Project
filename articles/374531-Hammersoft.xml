'''Votes''' (also called '''Vod''') are a people of Votia in [[Ingria]], the part of modern day northwestern [[Russia]] that is roughly southwest of [[Saint Petersburg]] and east of the Estonian border-town of [[Narva]]. Their own ethnic name is ''Vadjalain'' (plural: ''VadjalaizÃµt''). The [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] [[Votic language]] spoken by Votes is close to [[Language death|extinction]]. Votians were one of the founding people of [[Veliky Novgorod]]. The Votic language is still spoken in three villages of historical Votia and by an unknown number of fluent Votic speakers in the countryside.  The villages are ''JÃµgÃµperÃ¤'' (Krakolje) ''LiivtÅ¡Ã¼lÃ¤'' (Peski), ''Luuditsa'' (LuÅ¾itsÃµ)&lt;ref name=&quot;ERM&quot;&gt;[http://www.erm.ee/?lang=EST&amp;node=648&amp;parent=83 Eesti Rahva Muuseum: Vadjalased] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a desire to protect and revive the Votic language from extinction. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==History==
Votes are the oldest known ethnic group in Ingria. They are probably descended from an Iron-age population of north-eastern Estonia and western Ingria. Some scientists claim they were a tribe of Estonians, who developed a separate identity during isolation from other Estonians. It is speculated the ancient Estonian county of [[Vaiga]] got its name from Votians.&lt;ref name=&quot;ERM&quot;/&gt; The [[Budini]], ancient people described by [[Herodotus]], have been identified as Votes. The [[Kylfings]], a people active in Northern Europe during the [[Viking Age]], may have also been Votes.

Earliest literary references of Votes by their traditional name are from middle-age Russian sources, where Votes are referred to as ''VoÄ''. They were previously considered [[Chud]]es together with Estonians in Russian sources, and [[Lake Peipus]] near Votian homelands is called ''Chudsko ozero'', meaning &quot;Lake of Chudes&quot; in Russian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suomensukuiset kansat&quot;&gt;Toivo Vuorela: ''Suomensukuiset kansat'', Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 1960 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1069 Votes were mentioned taking part in an attack on the [[Novgorod Republic]] by the [[Principality of Polotsk]]. Eventually Votes became part of the Novgorod Republic and in 1149 they were mentioned taking part in an attack by Novgorod against ''[[Jems]]'' who are speculated to be peoples of [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]]. One of the administrative divisions of Novgorod, ''Voch'skaa'', was named after Votes. After the collapse of Novgorod, the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] deported many votes from their homelands and began more aggressive conversion of them. Missionary efforts started in 1534, after Novgorod's [[Macarius, Metropolitan of Moscow|archbishop Macarius]] complained to [[Ivan IV]] that Votes were still practicing their pagan beliefs. Makarius was authorized to send monk Ilja to convert the Votes. Ilja destroyed many of the old holy shrines and worshiping places. Conversion was slow and the next [[archbishop Feodosii]] had to send priest Nikifor to continue Ilja's work. Slowly Votes were converted and they become devoted Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;GR&quot;&gt;Gustav RÃ¤nk, ''Vatjalaiset'', Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, Helsinki 1960 ''(Finnish)''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sweden controlled Ingria in the 17th century, and attempts to convert local Orthodox believers to the Lutheran faith caused some of the Orthodox population to migrate elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joensuu.fi/ajankohtaista/vaitos2.php?id=921 Mika Sivonen, ''Me inkerikot, vatjalaiset ja karjalaiset&quot; - Uskonnollinen integrointi ja ortodoksisen vÃ¤hemmistÃ¶n identiteetin rakentuminen Ruotsin InkerissÃ¤ 1680-1702''] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time many Finnish peoples immigrated to Ingria. Religion separated the Lutheran Finns and Orthodox Izhorians and Votes, so intermarriage was uncommon between these groups. Votes mainly married other Votes, or Izhorians and Russians. They were mostly trilingual in Votic, Izhoran and Russian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suomensukuiset kansat&quot;/&gt; In 1848, the number of Votes had been 5,148, (Ariste 1981: 78).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Ariste]] 1981. ''Keelekontaktid''. Tallinn: Valgus. [pt. 2.6. ''Kolme lÃ¤Ã¤nemere keele hÃ¤Ã¤bumine'' lk. 76-82] {{et icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the Russian census of 1926 there were only 705 left. From the early 20th century on, the Votic language no longer passed to following generations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suomensukuiset kansat&quot;/&gt; Most Votes were evacuated to [[Finland]] along with Finnish [[Ingrians]] during [[World War II]], but were returned to the Soviet Union later.&lt;ref name=&quot;RedBook&quot;&gt;[http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/votes.shtml The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a distinct [[nation|people]], Votes have become practically extinct after [[Stalinist]] dispersion to distant Soviet provinces as 'punishment' for alleged disloyalty and cowardice during World War II. Expelees allowed to return in 1956 found their old homes occupied by Russians.&lt;ref name=&quot;RedBook&quot;/&gt; In 1989, there were still 62 known Votes left, with the youngest born in 1930. There were 73 self-declared Votes in the 2002 Russian census. Of them 12 lived in [[St. Petersburg]], 12 in [[Leningrad Oblast]] and 10 in [[Moscow]]. In 2008 Votes were added to list of Indigenous peoples of Russia, granting them some support to preserving their culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkeri.com/vatjalaiset.html Inkeri: Kantakansojen pÃ¤ivillÃ¤ pohdittiin vatjalaisten ja inkerikkojen tulevaisuutta], {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some conflicts with Votic villagers and foresters, and in 2001 the Votic museum was burned in village of LuÅ¾itsÃµ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaikuttava.net/article.php?sid=1215 Vaikuttava Tietotoimisto: Sukukansojamme kohdanneet onnettomuudet] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible problem is a port which is being constructed to [[Ust-Luga]]. It is planned that some 35,000 people would move near historic Votic and Izhoran villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inkeri.ee/INKERI/2008_05/Laukaansuu.htm Inkeri.ee: Laukaansuun suursatama uhkaa inkerois- ja vatjalaiskyliÃ¤] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Votes in Latvia==

The Votes in Latvia were called ''krieviÅi'' in Latvian. The word comes from ''krievs'', which means &quot;Russian&quot;. Historical sources indicate the [[Teutonic Knights]] led by [[Vinke von Overberg]] captured many people in [[Ingermanland]] during their attack there in 1444â1447, and moved them to [[Bauska]], where a workforce was needed to built a castle. It is estimated that some 3,000 people were transferred there. After the castle was built, the Votes did not go back, but were settled in the vicinity of Bauska and became farmers. Gradually, they forgot their own language and customs and were assimilated by the neighboring [[Latvians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Suomensukuiset kansat&quot;/&gt; They are first mentioned in literature of 1636. The first &quot;modern&quot; scientist to study them was Finnish [[Anders Johan SjÃ¶gren]], but the first person to connect them with Votes was [[Ferdinand Johan Wiedemann]] in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;Marjo Mela ja Lembit Valba: Latvian historiaa ja kulttuuria. RozentÄls-seura. ISBN 951-986-71-1-2 {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latvian poet [[JÄnis Rainis]] had some Votic roots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roots-saknes.lv/Ethnicities/Vots/vots.htm Ethnicity of the Latvian Vots - The KrieviÅi]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Historically most Votes were farmers. [[Slash and burn]] (''sardo'') was practiced until the early 20th century. Cattle, horses and geese were the most important livestock. Some made their living from fishing. Many primitive fishing habits survived a long time in Votic communities, such as fishing with a club or spear. [[Seine fishing]] was practiced during the winter. Votians formed seine groups (''artelli'') and made fishing trips as far as the Finnish outer islands like [[Seskar]]. Fishermen lived in wooden sleds called (''pudka'') during these trips.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suomensukuiset kansat&quot;/&gt; Hunting was never an important source of income, because local nobility had reserved the right to hunt to themselves. Since St. Petersburg was so close to Votic homelands, many of the Votes went working there. Men worked in factories and women worked as servants. This contributed to rapid demise of Votic culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suomensukuiset kansat&quot;/&gt; 

Votes were quite poorly educated, and only one Vote, [[Dmitri Tsvetkov]], is known to have ever attended and graduated from a University. Ancient Votic religion is not known well, but it is assumed that it was similar to other Finnic-beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suomensukuiset kansat&quot;/&gt;

===Language and Identity===
Most Votes were able to speak [[Izhorian language|Izhorian]] and Russian as well as the Votic language. In fact, Izhorian was more common in every day use than Votic in some villages. Votic was commonly used with family members, while Russian and Izhorian were used with others. Russian was the only language used in Churches. Votes often referred to themselves as ''Izores'', since this term was more commonly known among others. The term came in use when people wanted to make a difference between Lutheran and Orthodox Finnic populations in Ingria.&lt;ref&gt;Mauno Jokipii, ''ItÃ¤merensuomalaiset - Heimokansojen historiaa ja kohtaloita'', JyvÃ¤skylÃ¤ 1995, ISBN 951-39362-80-0&lt;/ref&gt;
