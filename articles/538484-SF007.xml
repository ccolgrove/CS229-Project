== History  ==
{{See also|History of the Opera web browser|Opera Mobile#History|Opera Mini#History|Nintendo DS Browser#Launch|Internet Channel#History}}
Opera Software was founded as an independent company on August 30, 1995 by [[Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner]] and [[Geir IvarsÃ¸y]].&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;&gt;[http://www.opera.com/company/about/milestones/ Opera Software - Milestones&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The company was created to continue what was originally a research project at [[Telenor]], the largest Norwegian telecommunications company.

Opera Software's first product, the Opera web browser version 2.1 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], was released in 1997.  Opera Software had an [[Initial public offering|IPO]] in February 2004, and was listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] March 11, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot; /&gt;

In an attempt to capitalize on the emerging market for Internet-connected handheld devices, a project to port the Opera browser to more platforms was started in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;/&gt; Opera 4.0, released in 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Affiliated&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxkeh.com/downloads/history/history-original.pdf |title=Affiliated Organization of Firefox and Mozilla|publisher=Mozilla Japan |year=2006 |accessdate=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; included a new cross-platform core that facilitated creation of editions of Opera for multiple [[operating system]]s and [[Platform (computing)|platform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.markschenk.com/opera/history.html |title=Opera browser version history |last=Schenk |first=Mark |date=6 January 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jon Tetzchner Opera CEO.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner]], founder]]
Up to this point, the Opera browser was [[trialware]] and had to be purchased after the trial period ended.  But version 5.0 (released in 2000) saw the end of the trial period requirement. Instead, Opera became [[Adware|ad-sponsored]], displaying advertisements to users without a license,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theregister.com/2000/12/06/opera_browser_goes_free/ |title=Opera browser goes free with version 5.0 launch |last=Lettice |first=John |publisher=[[The Register]] |date=6 December 2000 |accessdate=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was commonly criticized as a barrier to gaining market share. In newer versions, the user was allowed a choice of generic graphical [[banner ad|banners]] or text-based targeted advertisements provided by [[Google]] based upon the page being viewed.

On January 12, 2005, Opera Software announced that it would offer free licenses to higher education institutions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2005/01/12/ Students surf safely with Opera: Opera site license free for educational institutions], January 12, 2005, retrieved on October 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; a change from the previous cost of $1,000 USD for unlimited licenses. Schools that opted for the free license included [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Harvard University]], [[University of Oxford]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology]], and [[Duke University]].

With version 8.5 (released in 2005) the advertisements were removed entirely and primary financial support came through revenue from Google (which is by contract Opera's default search engine).&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/opera-goes-free-with-help-from-google/2227/ |title=Opera Goes Free with Help from Google |last=Baker |first=Loren |publisher=Search Engine Journal |date=20 September 2005 |accessdate=12 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction in August 2005 of &quot;[[Opera Mini]]&quot;, a [[Java ME]] based web browser for [[mobile phone]]s marketed not to end users but to [[mobile network operator]]s, possibly marks a new direction towards directly [[revenue]]-generating business, making the company less dependent on give-away and advertising-based Internet software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2005/08/10/ Have WAP but want WEB?

=== Legal issues ===
On May 18, 2004, Opera Software settled a lawsuit.  Its statement on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] read:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jp.opera.com/company/investors/disclosures/2004/05/18/0821/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061019050322/http://jp.opera.com/company/investors/disclosures/2004/05/18/0821/ |title=Settlement Of Legal Claims |work=Stock Exchange Announcements |publisher=Opera Software |date=May 18, 2004 |archivedate=19 October 2006 |accessdate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/05/18/opera_legal/ |title=Opera settles legal claims |last=Oates |first=John |publisher=[[The Register]] |date=18 May 2004 |accessdate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Opera Software ASA has settled legal claims with an international corporation resulting in payment to Opera of net USD 12.75 million.  The other party is not a customer of Opera and the settlement does not negatively impact future revenues. The entire amount will be booked in Q2.

Details are confidential pursuant to the settlement agreement.}}

It is widely theorized that the 'international corporation' named above is [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/Microsoft+behind+%2412+million+payment+to+Opera/2100-1032_3-5218163.html Microsoft behind $12 million payment to Opera], URL access on April 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; who had previously blocked Opera users from correctly viewing [[MSN]].com (see [[History of the Opera web browser#First MSN.com controversy|First MSN.com controversy]] and [[History of the Opera web browser#Second MSN.com controversy|Second MSN.com controversy]]).

In 2007 Opera filed a complaint against [[Microsoft]] in the [[European Commission]], alleging that bundling [[Internet Explorer]] with [[Microsoft Windows]] is harmful to both the consumer and to other web browser companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=7332 |title=Opera files complaint against Microsoft in the EU over IE, Windows bundle; CTO makes Web standards case |last=Dignan |first=Larry |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=13 December 2007 |accessdate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint resulted in the creation of [[BrowserChoice.eu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/12/microsoft-to-randomly-generate-browser-ballot-list.ars |title=Microsoft to randomly generate EU browser ballot list |publisher=ArsTechnica |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;AdMarvel acquisition
