'''Commerce''' is a city located in southeast [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 12,823 at the 2010 census, up from 12,568 at the 2000 census.  It is bordered by [[Vernon, California|Vernon]] on the west, Los Angeles on the northwest, [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] on the north, [[Montebello, California|Montebello]] on the east, [[Downey, California|Downey]] and [[Bell Gardens, California|Bell Gardens]] on the south, and [[Maywood, California|Maywood]] on the southwest.  The [[Los Angeles River]] forms part of its southwestern boundary, and the [[Rio Hondo (California)|Rio Hondo]] separates it from Downey.  Commerce is served by the [[Long Beach Freeway|Long Beach]] and [[Santa Ana Freeway|Santa Ana]] freeways, as well as the [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] [[commuter rail]] service. It is usually referred to as the &quot;City of Commerce&quot; to distinguish it from the [[common noun]].

==Geography==
Commerce is located at {{Coord|34|0|2|N|118|9|17|W|type:city}} (34.000613, -118.154781).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.5|sqmi|km2}}, over 99% of it land.

==History and development==
In the 19th century, the area was part of [[JosÃ© del Carmen Lugo#Antonio Maria Lugo|Antonio Maria Lugo]]'s [[Rancho San Antonio (Lugo)|Rancho San Antonio]].  Its conversion to an industrial area began in 1887, when the [[Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway]] built its main line through the area. The ranch remained intact until [[Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker]], reputedly once the wealthiest woman in Los Angeles, sold some of it around the turn of the 20th century. By the 1920s, factories had arrived. In the late 1940s, industrial leaders banded together with residents in the communities of Bandini and Rosewood and part of Bell Gardens to encourage commerce. They changed the name to match that goal.

The city was incorporated in 1960 to prevent neighboring cities such as Vernon and Los Angeles from annexing industrial land for tax revenue.  In the 1970s and 1980s, Commerce successfully negotiated the turbulent period of deindustrialization that hammered nearby cities such as [[South Gate, California|South Gate]] and [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]], maintaining much of its manufacturing and goods-distribution base and successfully converting former industrial land to lucrative commercial uses.  The most notable example of this phenomenon is the Citadel outlet mall, which occupies the site of a former tire factory.  With a major [[rail yard]] within its borders, Commerce has also benefited greatly from the huge expansion in international trade traffic through the ports of Los Angeles and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], albeit at the expense of severe air pollution caused by truck congestion on the Long Beach Freeway.

Chrysler had an assembly plant in Commerce from 1930 through July 1971 located at 5800 S. Eastern and Slauson. It was closed at the end of the 1971 model year, as Chrysler decided to triple-stack its transport trains for the 1972 model year; its Los Angeles facility couldn't accommodate this change.

The City celebrated its 50th anniversary on January 28, 2010.
