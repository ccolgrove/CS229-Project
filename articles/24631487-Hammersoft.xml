The first single, a cover of [[Grammy Award]]-winning American [[country music]] duo [[Sugarland]]'s hit &quot;[[Stay (Sugarland song)|Stay]]&quot;, was released digitally on the same day.

==Album information==
The album ''Winter Songs'' follows the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[List of number-one albums (UK)|number one album]] ''[[Songs for My Mother]]'' released six months earlier, this time pulling together a set of 11 songs that evoke special memories of winter and Christmas for [[Ronan Keating]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Universal Music UK News&quot;&gt;[http://www.umusic.co.uk/News/NewsItem.aspx?id=615 Universal Music UK News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hmv.com: music: Winter Songs 2009&quot;&gt;[http://hmv.com/hmvweb/displayProductDetails.do?ctx=220;1;4;90;-1&amp;sku=280034 hmv.com: music: Winter Songs (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Winter Songs'' includes traditional Christmas classics such as &quot;[[Silent Night]]&quot; and &quot;[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]&quot; as well as modern festive classics like [[Joni Mitchell]]'s [[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]] and [[Sugarland]]'s &quot;[[Stay (Sugarland song)|Stay]]&quot;. Songs originally performed by artists like [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]] (&quot;[[Homeward Bound (song)|Homeward Bound]]&quot;) and [[Bob Dylan]] (&quot;Ring Them Bells&quot;) are also included on the album, which also includes two brand new Ronan Keating songs &quot;It's Only Christmas&quot; and &quot;Scars&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hmv.com: music: Winter Songs 2009&quot;/&gt; Like Keating's previous album, ''Winter Songs'' is produced by [[Stephen Lipson]] ([[Paul McCartney]], [[Annie Lennox]] and [[Pet Shop Boys]]). The album also features the last studio recording of [[Stephen Gately]], who died a short while after the album was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Gately&quot;&gt;[http://primetime.unrealitytv.co.uk/stephen-gatelys-last-song-was-the-little-drummer-boy-with-ronan-keating/ Stephen Gately's last song was The Little Drummer Boy]&lt;/ref&gt; Ronan told The News Of The World: âWhat keeps me going is that Stephen is on this album. His vocal on Little Drummer Boy is one of the most beautiful recordings. He is almost angelic â which is truly fitting as I believe my friend is an angel now.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen Gately&quot;/&gt; In a press release about the album, Keating said that &quot;some of these songs conjure up some of my favorite Christmas memories&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Universal Music UK News&quot;/&gt;
