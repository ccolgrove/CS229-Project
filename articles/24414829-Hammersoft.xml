'''''Wordshaker''''' is the second studio album by [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[Ireland|Irish]] girl group [[The Saturdays]], released on 12 October 2009 through [[Fascination Records]]. It is the group's first album to feature a song where they are credited as writers. Upon release the album peaked at number nine on the [[UK Albums Chart]], but the following week fell out of the top 30. As of August 2010, the album has been removed from UK iTunes and other digital download outlets, possibly due to ''[[Headlines!]]'' being released featuring some of the same material.

It was preceded by the lead single &quot;[[Forever Is Over]]&quot;, written by [[James Bourne]] and produced by [[The Runaways]] which peaked at number two. Second single &quot;[[Ego (The Saturdays song)|Ego]]&quot; was released on 4 January 2010 and equalled the album's success by reaching number nine on the [[UK Singles Chart]]

The album has sold over 100,000 copies.

==Background and production==
The group started work on their second album in early March 2009 whilst  the group performed their first headline shows, [[The Work Tour]]. Two songs from the recording sessions &quot;One Shot&quot; and &quot;Wordshaker&quot; were part of the setlist and will appear on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesaturdays.co.uk/news.php?id=231 |title=News, A star review from Brum |publisher=The Saturdays |date= |accessdate=2009-09-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official cover was revealed in a special mailer to fans on the group's official form/website on 23 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaturdays.forums.umusic.co.uk/t/7924.aspx |title=Wordshaker: Revealed (Mailer - 23.09.09) - The Saturdays Official Forum |publisher=Thesaturdays.forums.umusic.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The majority of the album (seven songs) were written/co-written by [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] songwriter Ina Wroldsen who has written previously for the group as well as working with The [[Pussycat Dolls]], [[Pixie Lott]] and [[Leona Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nettwerk.com/producer/ina-wroldsen |title=Nettwerk: Official Profile for Ina Wroldsen |publisher=Nettwerk.com |date= |accessdate=2009-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the album features one song called &quot;Deeper&quot; which accredits every member of the group as a writer. Additionally it was revealed that the song &quot;Forever Is Over&quot; (later chosen to be the first single) was in fact written for [[Kelly Clarkson]] to record for her album. However during a visit to the record label's HQ The Saturdays heard the song and requested the song's writer [[James Bourne]] to let them record it instead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=17156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==
The news section on the group's official website indicated that through September and October 2009, the girls can be seen on many TV shows as they promote the album.&lt;ref name=promotion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesaturdays.co.uk/news.php?id=286 |title= The Saturdays, coming to a screen near you! |publisher=Saturdays.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-09-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 September the group were interviewed on [[T4 (Channel 4)|T4]] where they introduced the music video for new single &quot;[[Forever Is Over]]&quot;. Additionally on the 28 September the group appeared on daytime chatshow the ''[[Paul O'Grady Show]]'' for the first live performance of the single and an informal interview. They did the same on [[ITV1]]'s daytime show ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'' on 6 October.&lt;ref name=promotion/&gt; On 12 October they appeared on the new season of ''[[The Alan Titchmarsh Show]]'' for a chat and performance before a scheduled appearance at the [[Hollyoaks|Hollyoaks Music Festival]] on 17 October to perform &quot;Forever Is Over&quot; and the title song &quot;Wordshaker&quot;.&lt;ref name=promotion/&gt;

With the release of &quot;Ego&quot;, promotion for the album was furthered over the Christmas period, as the group appeared on ''[[GMTV]]'', ''[[Blue Peter]]'', ''[[Alan Carr: Chatty Man]]'' and the Christmas edition of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', as well as a T4 special filmed at an exclusive concert held for competition winners at the [[London Forum]], as part of the group's promotional tie in with the [[Impulse (body mist)|Impulse]] range of deodorants. Additionally, the album track &quot;Lose Control&quot; came to prominence when featured on the soundtrack to the film ''[[St Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold]]'', released by the group's record label Fascination.

&quot;Wordshaker&quot; generated generally favorable reviews amongst critics upon its release. [[Allmusic]]'s Matthew Chisling awarded the album three out of five stars, praising the girls and the album for &quot;combining aggressive basslines and vocals that are a pinch of prowess&quot;. Chisling's praised tracks like &quot;Open Up,&quot; &quot;Lose Control,&quot; and &quot;Not Good Enough&quot; for their &quot;catchiness [that] can't be denied&quot;. However he criticized &quot;Forever Is Over&quot; and &quot;One Shot&quot; for being &quot;unoriginal&quot; and for being &quot;too Americanized&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisling&quot;/&gt; &lt;br&gt; 

David Balls of [[Digital Spy]] said that &quot;If anything, the girls are showing even more confidence this time around&quot;, Praising 'One Shot' and 'Wordshaker' for both combining &quot;grinding basslines with lethal pop hooks&quot;. However he was less impressed with the ballads criticizing and calling them a &quot;curse&quot; on the album. As a whole he called the album &quot;fresh-sounding&quot; and that it &quot;should take the group one step closer to household names&quot;. He went on to give the album three out of five stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balls&quot;/&gt; 

Michael Cragg from [[musicOMH]] called the album as a whole an &quot;enjoyable blast of well-crafted pop&quot; with &quot;throbbing synths&quot; that's &quot;joyful&quot;. The only critique Michael had was that &quot;The Saturdays have yet to master - the ballad&quot; stating they &quot;bludgeon most of the slower songs to death.&quot; but when they stick to having fun its very &quot;enjoyable&quot;. Michael went on to give the album three out of five stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cragg&quot;/&gt;
