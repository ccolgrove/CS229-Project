'''Philosophy''' is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with [[Ontology|existence]], [[Epistemology|knowledge]], values, reason, [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], and language.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: &quot;Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: &quot;The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason|rational argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: &quot;Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less [[systematic]] kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;philosophy&quot; comes from the Greek ÏÎ¹Î»Î¿ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î± (''philosophia''), which literally means &quot;love of wisdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%23111487 |title=Philosophia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, '&amp;#39;A Greek-English Lexicon'&amp;#39;, at Perseus |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=philosophy&amp;searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The definition of philosophy is: &quot;1.orig., love of, or the search for, wisdom or knowledge 2.theory or logical analysis of the principles underlying conduct, thought, knowledge, and the nature of the universe&quot;.{{cite book |title=Webster's New World Dictionary |edition=Second College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The introduction of the terms &quot;philosopher&quot; and &quot;philosophy&quot; has been ascribed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Diogenes Laertius]]: &quot;Lives of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D1 I, 12]; [[Cicero]]: &quot;Tusculanae disputationes&quot;, V, 8â9&lt;/ref&gt; The ascription is said to be based on a passage in a lost work of Herakleides Pontikos, a disciple of [[Aristotle]]. It is considered to be part of the widespread body of legends of Pythagoras of this time. &quot;Philosopher&quot; was understood as a word which contrasted with &quot;[[sophist]]&quot; (from ''sophoi''). Traveling sophists or &quot;wise men&quot; were important in [[Classical Greece]], often earning money as teachers, whereas philosophers are &quot;lovers of wisdom&quot; and not professionals.

While philosophy used to refer to any pursuit on knowledge, the field covered by philosophy has decreased over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Newton's Philosophy |author=Andrew Janiak|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-philosophy/ |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |quote=Fully understanding Newton means avoiding anachronistically substituting our conception of philosophy in the twenty-first century for what the early moderns called 'natural philosophy'. To be sure, the latter includes much that we now call 'science', and yet it clearly includes much else besides. |date=13 October 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia Encyclopedia philosophy: Definition|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/philosophy|publisher=Answers.com|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more facts were agreed upon or became available, [[natural philosophy]] was replaced by sciences such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]].&lt;ref name=columbia/&gt; [[Psychology]], a [[social science]], became considered a science apart from philosophy in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=columbia/&gt;

==Branches of philosophy==
The following branches are the main areas of study&lt;ref&gt;http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/page/undergrad&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Metaphysics]]''' is the study of the nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and body, substance and accident, events and causation. Traditional branches are [[cosmology]] and [[ontology]].
* '''[[Epistemology]]''' is concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge, and whether knowledge is possible. Among its central concerns has been the challenge posed by [[skepticism]] and the relationships between [[truth]], [[belief]], and [[Theory of justification|justification]].
* '''[[Ethics]]''', or &quot;moral philosophy&quot;, is concerned primarily with the question of the best way to live, and secondarily, concerning the question of whether this question can be answered. The main branches of ethics are [[meta-ethics]], [[normative ethics]], and [[applied ethics]]. Meta-ethics concerns the nature of ethical thought, such as the origins of the words good and bad, and origins of other comparative words of various ethical systems, whether there are absolute ethical truths, and how such truths could be known.  Normative ethics are more concerned with the questions of how one ought to act, and what the right course of action is.  This is where most ethical theories are generated. Lastly, applied ethics go beyond theory and step into real world ethical practice, such as questions of whether or not abortion is correct. Ethics is also associated with the idea of [[morality]], and the two are often interchangeable.
* '''[[Logic]]''' is the study of valid argument forms. Beginning in the late 19th century, [[mathematician]]s such as [[Gottlob Frege]] focused on a mathematical treatment of logic, and today the subject of logic has two broad divisions: [[mathematical logic]] (formal symbolic logic) and what is now called [[philosophical logic]].

Philosophy includes specialized branches of thought:

* '''[[Philosophy of language]]''' explores the nature, the origins, and the use of language.
* '''Philosophy of law''' (more commonly called '''[[jurisprudence]]''') explores the varying theories explaining the nature and the interpretations of the law in society.
* '''[[Philosophy of mind]]''' explores the nature of the mind, and its relationship to the body, and is typified by disputes between [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[materialism]]. In recent years there has been increasing similarity between this branch of philosophy and [[cognitive science]].
* '''[[Philosophy of religion]]'''
* '''[[Philosophy of science]]'''
* '''[[Political philosophy]]''' is the study of [[government]] and the relationship of individuals (or families and clans) to communities including the [[State (polity)|state]]. It includes questions about justice, law, property, and the rights and obligations of the citizen. Politics and ethics are traditionally inter-linked subjects, as both discuss the question of what is good and how people should live.
* '''[[Aesthetics]]''' deals with beauty, art, enjoyment, sensory-emotional values, perception, and matters of taste and sentiment.

Many academic disciplines have also generated philosophical inquiry. These include [[Philosophy of History|history]], [[philosophy of logic|logic]], and [[Philosophy of mathematics|mathematics]]. In addition, a range of disciplines have emerged to address areas that historically were the subjects of philosophy. These include  [[anthropology]], [[psychology]], and [[physics]].

==History==
{{Main|History of philosophy}}
{{see also|Western philosophy|Eastern philosophy|History of Western philosophy}}
Many societies have considered philosophical questions and built philosophical traditions based upon each other's works. 

[[Eastern philosophy]] is organized by the chronological periods of each region. Historians of western philosophy usually divide the subject into three or more periods, the most important being [[ancient philosophy]], [[medieval philosophy]], and [[modern philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, the multi-author Oxford History of Western Philosophy breaks the subject into eight volumes: ancient, medieval, Renaissance, two volumes covering the period 1600â1750, two volumes covering 1750â1945, and one volume on analytic philosophy since 1945.  Anthony Kenny's ''New History of Western Philosophy'' is divided in four volumes: ancient, medieval, early modern (1500â1830), and later modern (1830 to the present).  The more technical Cambridge History of Philosophy divides the topic into nine periods: Greek philosophy to Aristotle, Hellenistic philosophy, later Greek and early medieval, later medieval, Renaissance, three volumes for the 17thâ19th centuries, and a final volume on 1870â1945.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Egypt and Babylon====
{{further|[[Babylonian literature#Philosophy|Babylonian literature: Philosophy]]}}
{{Main|African philosophy}}
There are authors who date the philosophical maxims of Ptahhotep before the 25th century. For instance, Pulitzer Prize winning historian Will Durant dates these writings as early as 2880 BCE within ''[[The Story of Civilization|The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental History]]''. Durant claims that Ptahhotep could be considered the very first philosopher in virtue of having the earliest and surviving fragments of moral philosophy (i.e., &quot;The Maxims of Ptah-Hotep&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.africanholocaust.net/articles/ptahhotep.html The Maxims of Good Discourse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Lichtheim, ''Ancient Egyptian Literature'', p.61&lt;/ref&gt; Ptahhotep's grandson, Ptahhotep Tshefi, is traditionally credited with being the author of the collection of wise sayings known as ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p.79&lt;/ref&gt; whose opening lines attribute authorship to the vizier Ptahhotep: ''Instruction  of  the  Mayor  of  the  city,  the  Vizier Ptahhotep, under the Majesty of King Isesi''.

The origins of [[Babylonia]]n philosophy can be traced back to the wisdom of early [[Mesopotamia]], which embodied certain philosophies of life, particularly [[ethics]], in the forms of [[dialectic]], [[dialogue]]s, [[epic poetry]], [[folklore]], [[hymn]]s, [[lyrics]], [[prose]], and [[proverb]]s. The [[reasoning]] and [[rationality]] of the Babylonians developed beyond [[empiricism|empirical]] observation.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati (1981), &quot;Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia&quot;, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47.&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonian text ''Dialog of Pessimism'' contains similarities to the [[agnostic]] thought of the [[sophists]], the [[Heraclitus|Heraclitean]] doctrine of contrasts, and the dialogues of [[Plato]], as well as a precursor to the [[Maieutics|maieutic]] [[Socratic method]] of [[Socrates]] and Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Buccellati (1981), &quot;Wisdom and Not: The Case of Mesopotamia&quot;, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''101''' (1), p. 35-47 [43].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Milesians (Greek)|Milesian]] philosopher [[Thales]] is also traditionally said to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia.

====Ancient Chinese====
[[File:Confucius - Project Gutenberg eText 15250.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Confucius]], illustrated in ''Myths &amp; Legends of China'', 1922, by E.T.C. Werner.]]
{{Main|Chinese philosophy}}
Philosophy has had a tremendous effect on [[China|Chinese civilization]], and throughout [[East Asia]]. The majority of Chinese philosophy originates in the [[Spring and Autumn]] and [[Warring States Period|Warring States]] era, during a period known as the &quot;[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pe&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 | page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments.&lt;ref name=&quot;pe&quot;/&gt; It was during this era that the major philosophies of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism]], and [[Taoism]], arose,  along with philosophies that later fell into obscurity, like [[Agriculturalism]], [[School of Naturalists|Chinese Naturalism]], and the [[School of Names|Logicians]]. Of the many philosophical schools of China, only Confucianism and Taoism existed after the [[Qin Dynasty]] [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|suppressed any Chinese philosophy]] that was opposed to [[Legalism]].

Confucianism is [[humanism|humanistic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;juergensmeyer&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in global civil society |last= Juergensmeyer|first= Mark|year= 2005|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn=9780195188356|page=70|quote=...humanist philosophies such as Confucianism, which do not share a belief in divine law and do not exalt faithfulness to a higher law as a manifestation of divine will}}&lt;/ref&gt;  philosophy that believes that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucianism focuses on the cultivation of virtue and maintenance of ethics, the most basic of which are ''ren'', ''yi'', and ''li''.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2&quot;/&gt; ''Ren'' is an obligation of [[altruism]] and humaneness for other individuals within a community, ''yi'' is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good, and ''li'' is a system of norms and [[propriety]] that determines how a person should properly act within a community.&lt;ref name=&quot;craig2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|1998|p=536}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taoism]] focuses on establishing harmony with the [[Tao]], which is origin of and the totality of everything that exists. The word &quot;Tao&quot; (or &quot;Dao&quot;, depending on the [[romanization]] scheme) is usually translated as &quot;way&quot;, &quot;path&quot; or &quot;principle&quot;.  Taoist propriety and ethics emphasize the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)|Three Jewels of the Tao]]: [[compassion]], [[moderation]], and [[humility]], while Taoist thought generally focuses on [[nature]], the relationship between humanity and the cosmos ({{lang|zh|å¤©äººç¸åº}}); [[health]] and [[longevity]]; and [[wu wei]], action through inaction. Harmony with the [[Universe]], or the origin of it through the Tao, is the intended result of many Taoist rules and practices.

====Ancient Graeco-Roman====
{{main|Hellenistic philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophy}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|100px|thumb|[[Aristotle]]]]
Ancient Graeco-Roman philosophy is a period of Western philosophy, starting in the 6th century [c. 585] BC to the 6th century AD. It is usually divided into three periods: the [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic period]], the period of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and the post-Aristotelian (or [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]]) period. A fourth period that is sometimes added includes the [[Neoplatonic]] and [[Christian]] philosophers of [[Late Antiquity]]. The most important of the ancient philosophers (in terms of subsequent influence) are Plato and Aristotle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot;&gt;''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Plato specifically, is credited as the founder of Western philosophy. The philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] said of Plato: &quot;The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato. I do not mean the systematic scheme of thought which scholars have doubtfully extracted from his writings. I allude to the wealth of general ideas scattered through them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Process and Reality'' p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

The main subjects of ancient philosophy are: understanding the fundamental causes and principles of the [[universe]]; explaining it in an economical way; the epistemological problem of reconciling the diversity and change of the natural universe, with the possibility of obtaining fixed and certain knowledge about it; questions about things that cannot be perceived by the senses, such as [[number]]s, [[classical element|elements]], [[universals]], and [[gods]]. Socrates is said to have been the initiator of more focused study upon the human things including the analysis of patterns of [[reasoning]] and argument and the nature of [[the good life]] and the importance of understanding and knowledge in order to pursue it; the explication of the concept of [[justice]], and its relation to various [[political systems]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford Companion to Philosophy&quot;/&gt;

In this period the crucial features of the Western [[philosophical method]] were established: a critical approach to received or established views, and the appeal to reason and argumentation. This includes Socrate's [[dialectic]] method of inquiry, known as the [[Socratic method]] or method of &quot;elenchus&quot;, which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such as the Good and [[Justice]]. To solve a problem, it would be broken down into a series of questions, the answers to which gradually distill the answer a person would seek. The influence of this approach is most strongly felt today in the use of the [[scientific method]], in which [[hypothesis]] is the first stage.

====Ancient Indian====
{{Main|Indian philosophy}}
{{See|Hindu philosophy|Buddhist philosophy|Jain philosophy|Upanishads}}
The term Indian philosophy (Sanskrit: ''Darshanas''), may refer to any of several traditions of [[Eastern philosophy|philosophical thought]] that originated in the [[Indian subcontinent]], including [[Hindu philosophy]], [[Buddhist philosophy]], and [[Jain philosophy]]. Having the same or rather intertwined origins, all of these philosophies have a common underlying theme of [[Dharma]], and similarly attempt to explain the attainment of emancipation. They have been formalized and promulgated chiefly between 1000 BC to a few centuries AD, with residual commentaries and reformations continuing up to as late as the 20th century by [[Aurobindo]] and [[ISKCON]] among others, who provided stylized interpretations. 

Traditionally, schools ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''Darshanas'') of Indian philosophy are identified as orthodox ([[Sanskrit|Skt]]: ''[[astika]]'') or non-orthodox (Skt: ''nastika'') depending on whether they regard the [[Veda]] as an infallible source of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of World Religions'', p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; There are six schools of orthodox [[Hindu philosophy]] and three heterodox schools. The orthodox are [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisesika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Purva mimamsa]] and [[Vedanta]]. The Heterodox are [[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and materialist ([[CÄrvÄka]]).  Competition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years, especially between 800 BC to 200 AD. Some like the [[Jain]], [[Buddhist]], [[Shaiva]] and [[Advaita]] schools survived, while others like [[Samkhya]] and [[Ajivika]] did not, either being assimilated or going extinct. The [[Sanskrit]] term for &quot;philosopher&quot; is ''{{IAST|dÄrÅanika}}'', one who is familiar with the systems of philosophy, or ''{{IAST|darÅanas}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Apte, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of the [[Indian subcontinent]], following the establishment of a [[Vedic period|Vedic]] culture, the development of philosophical and religious thought over a period of two millennia gave rise to what came to be called the six schools of ''[[Nastika|astika]]'', or orthodox, Indian or Hindu philosophy. These schools have come to be synonymous with the greater religion of [[Hinduism]], which was a development of the early [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]].

====Ancient Persian====
{{Main|Iranian philosophy}}
Persian philosophy can be traced back as far as Old Iranian philosophical traditions and thoughts, with their ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] roots. These were considerably influenced by [[Zarathustra]]'s teachings. Throughout Iranian history and due to remarkable political and social influences such as the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian]], the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab]], and the [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol invasions]] of Persia, a wide spectrum of schools of thought arose. These espoused a variety of views on philosophical questions, extending from Old Iranian and mainly [[Zoroastrianism]]-influenced traditions to schools appearing in the late pre-Islamic era, such as [[Manicheism]] and [[Mazdakism]], as well as various post-Islamic schools. Iranian philosophy after Arab invasion of [[Persia]] is characterized by different interactions with the [[Ancient philosophy|old Iranian philosophy]], the [[Greek philosophy]] and with the development of [[Islamic philosophy]]. [[Illuminationism]] and the [[transcendent theosophy]] are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in Persia. Zoroastrianism has been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackburn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy |author=Blackburn, Simon |year=1994 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===5th - 16th centuries===
====Europe====
=====Medieval=====
{{Main|Medieval philosophy}}
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|St. [[Thomas Aquinas]]|100px]]
Medieval philosophy is the philosophy of [[Western Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] during the [[Middle Ages]], roughly extending from the Christianization of the [[Roman Empire]] until the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume II: From Augustine to Scotus'' (Burns &amp; Oates, 1950), p. 1, dates medieval philosophy proper from the Carolingian Renaissance in the eighth century to the end of the fourteenth century, though he includes [[Augustine]] and the Patristic fathers as precursors. Desmond Henry, in Paul Edwards (ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan, 1967), vol. 5, pp. 252â257, starts with Augustine and ends with [[Nicole Oresme|Nicholas of Oresme]] in the late fourteenth century. David Luscombe, ''Medieval Thought'' (Oxford University Press, 1997), dates medieval philosophy from the conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in 312 to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1520s. Christopher Hughes, in A.C. Grayling (ed.), ''Philosophy 2: Further through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), covers philosophers from Augustine to Ockham. Jorge J.E. Gracia, in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2003), p. 620, identifies medieval philosophy as running from Augustine to [[John of St. Thomas]] in the seventeenth century. Anthony Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy, Volume II: Medieval Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), begins with Augustine and ends with the Lateran Council of 1512.&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy]], and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines of [[Abrahamic religion]] ([[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]]) with [[secularism|secular]] learning.

The history of western European medieval philosophy is traditionally divided into two main periods: the period in the [[Latin West]] following the [[Early Middle Ages]] until the 12th century, when the works of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] were preserved and cultivated; and the &quot;golden age&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries in the Latin West, which witnessed the culmination of the recovery of ancient philosophy, and significant developments in the field of [[philosophy of religion]], [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]].

The medieval era was disparagingly treated by the Renaissance humanists, who saw it as a barbaric &quot;middle&quot; period between the classical age of Greek and Roman culture, and the &quot;rebirth&quot; or ''renaissance'' of classical culture. Yet this period of nearly a thousand years was the longest period of philosophical development in Europe, and possibly the richest. [[Jorge Gracia]] has argued that &quot;in intensity, sophistication, and achievement, the philosophical flowering in the thirteenth century could be rightly said to rival the golden age of Greek philosophy in the fourth century B.C.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gracia, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of [[faith]] to [[reason]], the existence and unity of [[God]], the object of [[theology]] and [[metaphysics]], the problems of knowledge, of universals, and of individuation.

Philosophers from the Middle Ages include the Christian philosophers [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Boethius]], [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]], [[Gilbert of Poitiers]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Bonaventure]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]] and [[Jean Buridan]]; the Jewish philosophers [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]; and the [[Muslim]] philosophers [[Al-Kindi|Alkindus]], [[Al-Farabi|Alfarabi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]], [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Ghazali|Algazel]], [[Ibn Bajjah|Avempace]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]] and [[Averroes]]. The medieval tradition of [[Scholasticism]] continued to flourish as late as the 17th century, in figures such as [[Francisco Suarez]] and [[John of St. Thomas]].

Aquinas, father of [[Thomism]], was immensely influential in Catholic Europe, placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation, and was one of the first to use the new translation of Aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing. His work was a significant departure from the [[Neoplatonic]] and Augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early Scholasticism.

=====Renaissance=====
{{Main|Renaissance philosophy}}
[[File:Giordano Bruno Campo dei Fiori.jpg|thumb|[[Giordano Bruno]]|100px]]
The Renaissance (&quot;rebirth&quot;) was a period of transition between the Middle Ages and modern thought,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 5, loosely define the period as extending &quot;from the age of Ockham to the revisionary work of Bacon, Descartes and their contemporaries.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic, metaphysics, and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality, philology, and mysticism.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Copleston, ''A History of Philosophy, Volume III: From Ockham to Suarez'' (The Newman Press, 1953) p. 18: &quot;When one looks at Renaissance philosophy ... one is faced at first sight with a rather bewildering assortment of philosophies.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 4: &quot;one may identify the hallmark of Renaissance philosophy as an accelerated and enlarged interest, stimulated by newly available texts, in primary sources of Greek and Roman thought that were previously unknown or partially known or little read.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the classics and the humane arts generally, such as history and literature, enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in Christendom, a tendency referred to as [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge J.E. Gracia in Nicholas Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James (eds.), ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed. (Blackwell, 2002), p. 621: &quot;the humanists ... restored man to the centre of attention and channeled their efforts to the recovery and transmission of classical learning, particularly in the philosophy of Plato.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, ''ibid.'': &quot;The bulk of Renaissance thinkers, scholars and scientists were, of course, Christians ... but none the less the classical revival ... helped to bring to the fore a conception of autonomous man or an idea of the development of the human personality, which, though generally Christian, was more 'naturalistic' and less ascetic than the mediaeval conception.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic, the humanists followed [[Petrarch]] in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Schmitt and Quentin Skinner (eds.), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 61 and 63: &quot;From Petrarch the early humanists learnt their conviction that the revival of ''humanae literae'' was only the first step in a greater intellectual renewal&quot; [...] &quot;the very conception of philosophy was changing because its chief object was now manâman was at centre of every inquiry&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Renaissance Philosophy of Man&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=Cassirer|editor2-last=Kristeller|editor3-last=Randall|title=The Renaissance Philosophy of Man|year=1948|publisher=University of Chicago Press|chapter=Introduction|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The study of classical philosophy also developed in two new ways. On the one hand, the study of Aristotle was changed through the influence of [[Averroism]]. The disagreements between these Averroist Aristotelians, and more orthodox catholic Aristotelians such as [[Albertus Magnus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] eventually contributed to the development of a &quot;humanist Aristotelianism&quot; developed in the Renaissance, as exemplified in the thought of [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] and [[Giacomo Zabarella]]. Secondly, as an alternative to Aristotle, the study of [[Plato]] and the [[Neoplatonists]] became common. This was assisted by the rediscovery of works which had not been well known previously in Western Europe. Notable Renaissance Platonists include [[Nicholas of Cusa]], and later [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Renaissance Philosophy of Man&quot;/&gt;

The Renaissance also renewed interest in anti-Aristotelian theories of nature considered as an organic, living whole comprehensible independently of theology, as in the work of [[Nicholas of Cusa]], [[Nicholas Copernicus]], [[Giordano Bruno]], [[Telesius]], and [[Tommaso Campanella]].&lt;ref&gt;Copenhaver and Schmitt, ''Renaissance Philosophy'', pp. 285â328.&lt;/ref&gt; Such movements in natural philosophy dovetailed with a revival of interest in occultism, magic, [[hermeticism]], and [[astrology]], which were thought to yield hidden ways of knowing and mastering nature (e.g., in Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola).&lt;ref&gt;Pico Della Mirandola, Conclusiones philosophicae, cabalisticae et theologicae; Giordano Bruno, De Magia&lt;/ref&gt;

These new movements in philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations in Europe: the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and the decline of [[feudalism]].  Though the theologians of the Protestant Reformation showed little direct interest in philosophy, their destruction of the traditional foundations of theological and intellectual authority harmonized with a revival of [[fideism]] and skepticism in thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[Montaigne]], and [[Francisco Sanches]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Popkin, ''The History of Scepticism from Savonarola to Bayle'' (Oxford University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Copleston, pp. 228â229.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy'', vol. 3 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 8: &quot;The Lutheran Reformation [...] gave new impetus to the sceptical trend.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, the gradual centralization of political power in nation-states was echoed by the emergence of secular political philosophies, as in the works of [[NiccolÃ² Machiavelli]] (often described as the first modern political thinker, or a key turning point towards modern political thinking&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Machiavelli appears as the first modern political thinker&quot; {{Cite book|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Hobbes: Moral and Political Philosophy|first=Garrath|last=Williams|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

====East Asia====
{{Main|Neo-Confucianism|Japanese philosophy|Korean philosophy}}
[[Mid-Imperial China|Mid-Imperial Chinese]] philosophy is primarily defined by the development of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. During the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from [[Buddhism in Nepal|Nepal]] also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. (It should be noted that philosophy and religion were clearly distinguished in the West, whilst these concepts were more continuous in the East due to, for example, the philosophical concepts of Buddhism.)

[[Neo-Confucianism]] is a philosophical movement that advocated a more rationalist and secular form of [[Confucianism]] by rejecting superstitious and mystical elements of [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] that had influenced Confucianism during and after the Han Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Blocker |first=H. Gene|last2= Starling |first2=Christopher L.|year=2001 | page= 64|title=Japanese Philosophy|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Neo-Confucianists were critical of Daoism and Buddhism,&lt;ref name=&quot;huang5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Huang|1999|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the two did have an influence on the philosophy, and the Neo-Confucianists borrowed terms and concepts from both. However, unlike the Buddhists and Daoists, who saw [[metaphysics]] as a catalyst for spiritual development, religious enlightenment, and immortality, the Neo-Confucianists used metaphysics as a guide for developing a rationalist [[ethics|ethical]] philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSB&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Chan|2002|p=460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   

Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the [[Tang Dynasty]]; the Confucianist scholars [[Han Yu]] and [[Li Ao]] are seen as forbears of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song Dynasty.&lt;ref name=&quot;huang5&quot;/&gt; The Song Dynasty philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] is seen as the first true &quot;pioneer&quot; of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSB&quot;/&gt;

Elsewhere in East Asia, [[Japanese Philosophy]] began to develop as indigenous [[Shinto]] beliefs fused with [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and other schools of [[Chinese philosophy]] and [[Indian philosophy]]. Similar to Japan, in [[Korean philosophy]] the emotional content of [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] was integrated into the [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] imported from China.

====Middle East====
{{Main|Islamic philosophy}}
In early Islamic thought, which refers to philosophy during the &quot;[[Islamic Golden Age]]&quot;, traditionally dated between the 8th and 12th centuries, two main currents may be distinguished. The first is [[Kalam]], that mainly dealt with [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] questions. These include the [[Mu'tazili]] and [[Ash'ari]]. The other is [[#Falsafa|Falsafa]], that was founded on interpretations of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. There were attempts by later philosopher-theologians at harmonizing both trends, notably by [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina (Avicenna)]] who founded the school of [[Avicennism]], [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd (AverroÃ«s)]] who founded the school of [[Averroism]], and others such as [[Alhacen|Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen)]] and [[AbÅ« RayhÄn al-BÄ«rÅ«nÄ«]].

{{Main|Modern philosophy}}

Chronologically, the early modern era of western philosophy is usually identified with the 17th and 18th centuries, with the 18th century often being referred to as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Rutherford, ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. xiii, defines its subject thus: &quot;what has come to be known as &quot;early modern philosophy&quot;âroughly, philosophy spanning the period between the end of the sixteenth century and the end of the eighteenth century, or, in terms of figures, Montaigne through Kant.&quot; [[Steven Nadler]], ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'' (Blackwell, 2002), p. 1, likewise identifies its subject as &quot;the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries&quot;. Anthony Kenny, ''The Oxford History of Western Philosophy'' (Clarendon: Oxford University Press, 1994), p. 107, introduces &quot;early modern philosophy&quot; as &quot;the writings of the classical philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Europe&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern philosophy is distinguished from its predecessors by its increasing independence from traditional authorities such as the Church, academia, and Aristotelianism;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', pp. 1â2: &quot;By the seventeenth century [...] it had become more common to find original philosophical minds working outside the strictures of the universityâi.e., ecclesiasticâframework. [...] by the end of the eighteenth century, [philosophy] was a secular enterprise.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]], ''A New History of Western Philosophy'', vol. 3 (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. xii: &quot;To someone approaching the early modern period of philosophy from an ancient and medieval background the most striking feature of the age is the absence of Aristotle from the philosophic scene.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; a new focus on the foundations of knowledge and metaphysical system-building;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Rutherford, ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 1: &quot;epistemology assumes a new significance in the early modern period as philosophers strive to define the conditions and limits of human knowledge.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy'', vol. 3, p. 211: &quot;The period between Descartes and Hegel was the great age of metaphysical system-building.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and the emergence of modern physics out of natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy'', vol. 3, pp. 179â180: &quot;the seventeenth century saw the gradual separation of the old discipline of natural philosophy into the science of physics [...] [b]y the nineteenth century physics was a fully mature empirical science, operating independently of philosophy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other central topics of philosophy in this period include the nature of the mind and its relation to the body, the implications of the new natural sciences for traditional theological topics such as free will and God, and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy'', vol. 3, pp. 212â331.&lt;/ref&gt;  These trends first distinctively coalesce in [[Francis Bacon]]'s call for a new, empirical program for expanding knowledge, and soon found massively influential form in the mechanical physics and rationalist metaphysics of [[Rene Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, ''A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', pp. 2â3: &quot;Why should the early modern period in philosophy begin with Descartes and Bacon, for example, rather than with Erasmus and Montaigne? [...] Suffice it to say that at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and especially with Bacon and Descartes, certain questions and concerns come to the foreâa variety of issues that motivated the inquiries and debates that would characterize much philosophical thinking for the next two centuries.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first to apply this methodology systematically to [[political philosophy]] and is the originator of modern political philosophy, including the modern theory of a &quot;[[social contract]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hobmoral/|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Hobbes: Moral and Political Philosophy|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The most conventional of such histories are embodied in university courses and the textbooks that accompany them. This essay examines one such course, the History of Modern Philosophy, and the texts that helped to create it. If a philosopher in the United States were asked why the seven people in my title comprise Modern Philosophy, the initial response would be: they were the best, and there are historical and philosophical connections among them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; though influential contributions to philosophy were made by many thinkers in this period, such as [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], [[Isaac Newton]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Pierre Bayle]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[Jean d'Alembert]], and [[Adam Smith]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was a seminal figure in initiating reaction against the Enlightenment. The approximate end of the early modern period is most often identified with [[Immanuel Kant]]'s systematic attempt to limit metaphysics, justify scientific knowledge, and reconcile both of these with morality and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, ''The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Philosophy'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, ''A New History of Western Philosophy'', vol. 3, p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, A Companion to Early Modern Philosophy, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====19th-century philosophy====
{{Main|19th-century philosophy}}

Later modern philosophy is usually considered to begin after the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Shand&gt;Shand, John (ed.) ''Central Works of Philosophy, Vol.3 The Nineteenth Century'' (McGill-Queens, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;  German philosophy exercised broad influence in this century, owing in part to the dominance of the German university system.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Baldwin (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of Philosophy 1870â1945'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 4: &quot;by the 1870s Germany contained much of the best universities in the world. [...]  There were certainly more professors of philosophy in Germany in 1870 than anywhere else in the world, and perhaps more even than everywhere else put together.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  [[German idealist]]s, such as [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], transformed the work of Kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind-like process, and as such is entirely knowable.&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, Frederick C. ''The Cambridge Companion to Hegel'', (Cambridge, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s identification of this world-constituting process as an irrational [[will to live]] influenced later 19th- and early 20th-century thinking, such as the work of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]].

After Hegel's death in 1831, 19th-century philosophy largely turned against idealism in favor of varieties of philosophical [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], such as the [[positivism]] of [[Auguste Comte]], the empiricism of [[John Stuart Mill]], and the materialism of [[Karl Marx]].  Logic began a period of its most significant advances since the inception of the discipline, as increasing mathematical precision opened entire fields of inference to formalization in the work of [[George Boole]] and [[Gottlob Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of Philosophy 1870â1945'', p. 119: &quot;within a hundred years of the first stirrings in the early nineteenth century [logic] had undergone the most fundamental transformation and substantial advance in its history.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Other philosophers who initiated lines of thought that would continue to shape philosophy into the 20th century include

* [[Gottlob Frege]] and [[Henry Sidgwick]], whose work in logic and ethics, respectively, provided the tools for early [[analytic philosophy]].
* [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]], who founded [[pragmatism]].
* [[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who laid the groundwork for [[existentialism]] and [[post-structuralism]].

====20th-century philosophy====
{{Main|Contemporary philosophy}}
Within the last century, philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities, like other academic disciplines. Accordingly, it has become less general and more specialized. In the view of one prominent recent historian: &quot;Philosophy has become a highly organized discipline, done by specialists primarily for other specialists. The number of philosophers has exploded, the volume of publication has swelled, and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied. Not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind, something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Soames]], ''Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century'', vol. 2, p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English-speaking world, [[analytic philosophy]] became the dominant school for much of the 20th century. In the first half of the century, it was a cohesive school, shaped strongly by [[logical positivism]], united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to [[logic]] and [[language]]. The pioneering work of [[Bertrand Russell]] was a model for the early development of analytic philosophy, moving from a rejection of the idealism dominant in late 19th century British philosophy to an neo-Humean empiricism, strengthened by the conceptual resources of modern mathematical logic.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanford&quot;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/ &quot;Bertrand Russell&quot;], 1 May 2003: &quot;Russell is generally recognized as one of the founders of modern analytic philosophy. [...] he is regularly credited with being one of the most important logicians of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Edwards (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 7 (Macmillan, 1967), p. 239: &quot;Russell has exercised an influence on the course of Anglo-American philosophy in the twentieth century second to that of no other individual.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Baldwin (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of Philosophy 1870â1945'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 376: &quot;[...] the three greatest European philosophers of the twentieth centuryâHeidegger, Russell, and Wittgenstein.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter half of the 20th century, [[analytic philosophy]] diffused into a wide variety of disparate philosophical views, only loosely united by historical lines of influence and a self-identified commitment to clarity and rigor. The post-war transformation of the analytic program led in two broad directions: on one hand, an interest in ordinary language as a way of avoiding or redescribing traditional philosophical problems, and on the other, a more thoroughgoing [[naturalized epistemology|naturalism]] that sought to dissolve the puzzles of modern philosophy via the results of the natural sciences (such as cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology). The shift in the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], from a view congruent with logical positivism to a therapeutic dissolution of traditional philosophy as a linguistic misunderstanding of normal forms of life, was the most influential version of the first direction in analytic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Avrum Stroll, ''Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy'' (Columbia University Press, 2000), p. 252: &quot;More than any other analytic philosopher, [Wittgenstein] has changed the thinking of a whole generation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/wittgens/ &quot;Wittgenstein, Ludwig&quot;] in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: &quot;Ludwig Wittgenstein is one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century, and regarded by some as the most important since Immanuel Kant.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The later work of Russell and the philosophy of [[W.V.O. Quine]] are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Baldwin, ''Contemporary Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 2001), p. 90: &quot;[Quine] has been, without question, the most influential American philosopher of the second half of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hylton, &quot;Quine&quot;, in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: &quot;Quine's work has been extremely influential and has done much to shape the course of philosophy in the second-half of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Bailey, ''First Philosophy: Knowledge and Reality'' (Broadview Press, 2004), p. 274: &quot;Willard Van Orman Quine (1908â2000) was uncontroversially one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kenny, ''Philosophy in the Modern World'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 64: &quot;After Wittgenstein's death many people regarded W.V.O. Quine (1908â2000) as the doyen of Anglophone philosophy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; But the diversity of analytic philosophy from the 1970s onward defies easy generalization: the naturalism of Quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a &quot;new metaphysics&quot; of [[possible worlds]], as in the influential work of [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/david-lewis/]: &quot;David Lewis (1941â2001) was one of the most important philosophers of the 20th Century. He made significant contributions to philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, decision theory, epistemology, meta-ethics and aesthetics. In most of these fields he is essential reading; in many of them he is among the most important figures of recent decades. And this list leaves out his two most significant contributions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]], [[Michael Bratman]], [[John Martin Fischer]] (eds.), ''Introduction to Philosophy: Classical and Contemporary Readings'', 4th ed. (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 302: &quot;David Lewis (1941â2001) was one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the [[experimental philosophy]] movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques.

On continental Europe, no single school or temperament enjoyed dominance. The flight of the logical positivists from central Europe during the 1930s and 1940s, however, diminished philosophical interest in natural science, and an emphasis on the humanities, broadly construed, figures prominently in what is usually called &quot;[[continental philosophy]]&quot;. 20th century movements such as [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], modern [[hermeneutics]], [[critical theory]], [[structuralism]], and [[poststructuralism]] are included within this loose category.  The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first-person perspective,&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/ &quot;Edmund Husserl&quot;], in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'': &quot;Edmund Husserl was the principal founder of phenomenologyâand thus one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/husserl/ &quot;Husserl, Edmund&quot;], in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: &quot;he is arguably one of the most important and influential philosophers of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Martin Heidegger]] drew on the ideas of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Husserl to propose an unconventional [[existential]] approach to [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Geuss, in Thomas Baldwin (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of Philosophy 1870â1945'' (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 497: &quot;Heidegger is by a wide margin the single most influential philosopher of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/heidegge/ &quot;Heidegger, Martin&quot;], in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: &quot;Martin Heidegger is widely acknowledged to be one of the most original and important philosophers of the 20th century&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main theories==
===Realism and nominalism===
{{Main|Philosophical realism|Nominalism}}
''[[Philosophical realism|Realism]]'' sometimes means the position opposed to the 18th-century [[idealism]], namely that some things have real existence outside the mind. Its standard meaning is the doctrine that abstract entities corresponding to universal terms like &quot;man&quot; or &quot;table&quot; or &quot;red&quot; actually exist. For instance Plato believed these entities exist in a separate realm of ideas. It is opposed to [[nominalism]], the view that abstract or universal terms are words only, or denote mental states such as ideas, beliefs, or intentions. The latter position, developed by [[Peter Abelard]] and famously held by [[William of Ockham]], is called [[conceptualism]].

===Rationalism and empiricism===
{{Main|Rationalism|Empiricism}}
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van RenÃ© Descartes.jpg|thumb|[[RenÃ© Descartes]]]]
''Rationalism'' is any view emphasizing the role or importance of human reason. Extreme rationalism tries to base all knowledge on reason alone. Rationalism typically starts from premises that cannot coherently be denied, then attempts by logical steps to deduce every possible object of knowledge.

The first rationalist, in this broad sense, is often held to be [[Parmenides]] (fl. 500 BC), who argued that it is impossible to doubt that thinking actually occurs. But thinking must have an object, therefore something ''beyond'' thinking really exists. Parmenides deduced that what really exists must have certain propertiesâfor example, that it cannot come into existence or cease to exist, that it is a coherent whole, that it remains the same eternally (in fact, exists altogether outside time). This is known as the [[third man argument]]. [[Zeno of Elea]] (born c. 495 BC) was a disciple of Parmenides, and argued that motion is impossible, since the assertion that it exists implies a contradiction (see [[Zeno's arrow]]).

[[Plato]] (427â347 BC) was also influenced by Parmenides, but combined rationalism with a form of [[philosophical realism|realism]]. The philosopher's work is to consider being, and the essence ([[ousia]]) of things. But the characteristic of essences is that they are universal. The nature of a man, a triangle, a tree, applies to all men, all triangles, all trees. Plato argued that these essences are mind-independent &quot;[[theory of forms|forms]]&quot;, that humans (but particularly philosophers) can come to know by reason, and by ignoring the distractions of sense-perception.

Modern rationalism begins with [[Descartes]]. Reflection on the nature of perceptual experience, as well as scientific discoveries in physiology and optics, led Descartes (and also [[John Locke|Locke]]) to the view that we are directly aware of ideas, rather than objects. This view gave rise to three questions:

# Is an idea a true copy of the real thing that it represents? Sensation is not a direct interaction between bodily objects and our sense, but is a physiological process involving representation (for example, an image on the retina). Locke thought that a &quot;secondary quality&quot; such as a sensation of green could in no way resemble the arrangement of particles in matter that go to produce this sensation, although he thought that &quot;primary qualities&quot; such as shape, size, number, were really in objects.
# How can physical objects such as chairs and tables, or even physiological processes in the brain, give rise to mental items such as ideas? This is part of what became known as the [[mind-body problem]].
# If all the contents of awareness are ideas, how can we know that anything exists apart from ideas?

Descartes tried to address the last problem by reason. He began, echoing Parmenides, with a principle that he thought could not coherently be denied: I ''think'', therefore I ''am'' (often given in his original Latin: ''[[Cogito ergo sum]]''). From this principle, Descartes went on to construct a complete system of knowledge (which involves proving the existence of God, using, among other means, a version of the [[ontological argument]]). His view that reason alone could yield substantial truths about reality strongly influenced those philosophers usually considered modern rationalists (such as [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]), while provoking criticism from other philosophers who have retrospectively come to be grouped together as empiricists.

[[Empiricism]], in contrast to rationalism, downplays or dismisses the ability of reason alone to yield knowledge of the world, preferring to base any knowledge we have on our senses. This dates back to the concept of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' (unscribed tablet) implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On the Soul]]'', described more explicitly in [[Avicenna]]'s ''[[The Book of Healing]]'',&lt;ref name=Rizvi&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (CA. 980â1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and demonstrated in [[Ibn Tufail]]'s ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' as a [[thought experiment]].&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224â62, [[Brill Publishers]], ISBN 90-04-09459-8&lt;/ref&gt; Modern empiricism was notably expounded by [[Francis Bacon]], [[John Locke]] in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1689, and [[David Hume]].

During this era, religious ideas played a mixed role in the struggles that preoccupied secular philosophy. [[George Berkeley|Bishop Berkeley]]'s famous [[idealist]] refutation of key tenets of [[Isaac Newton]] is a case of an Enlightenment philosopher who drew substantially from religious ideas. Other influential religious thinkers of the time include [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Joseph Butler]], [[Thomas Reid]], and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]]. Other major writers, such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Edmund Burke]], took a rather different path.{{clarify|date=January 2011}}

===Skepticism===
{{Main|Skepticism}}
''Skepticism'' is a philosophical attitude that, in its most extreme form, questions the possibility of obtaining ''any'' sort of knowledge. It was first articulated by [[Pyrrho]], who believed that everything could be doubted except ''appearances''. [[Sextus Empiricus]] (2nd century AD), skepticism's most prominent advocate, describes it as an
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;ability to place in antithesis, in any manner whatever, appearances and judgments, and thus&amp;nbsp;... to come first of all to a suspension of judgment and then to mental tranquility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''PH'' (= ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'') I.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Skepticism so conceived is not merely the use of doubt, but is the use of doubt for a particular end: a calmness of the soul, or ''[[ataraxia]]''. Skepticism poses itself as a challenge to [[dogmatism]], whose adherents think they have found the truth.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''PH'' (= ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'') I.19â20&lt;/ref&gt;

Sextus noted that the reliability of perception may always be questioned, because it is idiosyncratic to the perceiver. The appearance of individual things changes depending on whether they are in a group: for example, the shavings of a goat's horn are white when taken alone, yet the intact horn is black. A pencil, when viewed lengthwise, looks like a stick; but when examined at the tip, it looks merely like a circle.

Skepticism was revived in the early modern period by [[Michel de Montaigne]] and [[Blaise Pascal]]. Its most extreme exponent, however, was [[David Hume]]. Hume argued that there are only two kinds of reasoning: what he called ''probable'' and ''demonstrative'' (cf. [[Hume's fork]]). Neither of these two forms of reasoning can lead us to a reasonable belief in the continued existence of an external world. Demonstrative reasoning cannot do this, because demonstration (that is, [[deductive reasoning]] from well-founded premises) alone cannot establish the uniformity of nature (as captured by scientific laws and principles, for example). Such reason alone cannot establish that the future will resemble the past. We have certain beliefs about the world (that the sun will rise tomorrow, for example), but these beliefs are the product of habit and custom, and do not depend on any sort of logical inferences from what is already given ''certain''. But ''probable'' reasoning ([[inductive reasoning]]), which aims to take us from the observed to the unobserved, cannot do this either: it ''also'' depends on the uniformity of nature, and this supposed uniformity cannot be proved, without circularity, by any appeal to uniformity. The best that either sort of reasoning can accomplish is conditional truth: ''if'' certain assumptions are true, ''then'' certain conclusions follow. So nothing about the world can be established with certainty. Hume concludes that there is no solution to the skeptical argumentâexcept, in effect, to ignore it.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And though a Pyrrhonian [i.e. a skeptic] may throw himself or others into a momentary amazement and confusion by his profound reasonings; the first and most trivial event in life will put to flight all his doubts and scruples, and leave him the same, in every point of action and speculation, with the philosophers of every other sect, or with those who never concerned themselves in any philosophical researches. When he awakes from his dream, he will be the first to join in the laugh against himself, and to confess, that all his objections are mere amusement.&quot; (''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', 1777, XII, Part 2, p. 128)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if these matters were resolved in every case, we would have in turn to justify our standard of justification, leading to an [[infinite regress]] (hence the term ''regress skepticism'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What the Tortoise Said to Achilles |author=Lewis Carroll |year=1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Knowledge Puzzles |author=Stephen Cade Hetherington |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many philosophers have questioned the value of such skeptical arguments. The question of whether we can achieve knowledge of the external world is based on how high a standard we set for the justification of such knowledge. If our standard is absolute certainty, then we cannot progress beyond the existence of mental sensations. We cannot even deduce the existence of a coherent or continuing &quot;I&quot; that experiences these sensations, much less the existence of an external world. On the other hand, if our standard is too low, then we admit follies and illusions into our body of knowledge. This argument against absolute skepticism asserts that the practical philosopher must move beyond [[solipsism]], and accept a standard for knowledge that is high but not absolute.

===Idealism===
{{Main|Idealism}}
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]
Idealism is the epistemological doctrine that nothing can be directly known outside of the minds of thinking beings. Or in an alternative stronger form, it is the metaphysical doctrine that nothing exists apart from minds and the &quot;contents&quot; of minds. In modern Western philosophy, the epistemological doctrine begins as a core tenet of Descartesâthat what is in the mind is known more reliably than what is known through the senses. The first prominent modern Western idealist in the metaphysical sense was [[George Berkeley]]. Berkeley argued&lt;ref&gt;First Dialogue&lt;/ref&gt; that there is no deep distinction between mental states, such as feeling pain, and the ideas about so-called &quot;external&quot; things, that appear to us through the senses. There is no real distinction, in this view, between certain sensations of heat and light that we experience, which lead us to believe in the external existence of a fire, and the fire itself. Those sensations are all there is to fire. Berkeley expressed this with the Latin formula ''esse est percipi'': &quot;to be is to be perceived&quot;. In this view the opinion, &quot;strangely prevailing upon men&quot;, that houses, mountains, and rivers have an existence independent of their perception by a thinking being is false.

Forms of idealism were prevalent in philosophy from the 18th century to the early 20th century. Transcendental idealism, advocated by [[Immanuel Kant]], is the view that there are limits on what can be understood, since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment. Kant wrote his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781â1787) in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism, and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics. Kant's intention with this work was to look at what we know and then consider what must be true about it, as a logical consequence of the ''way'' we know it. One major theme was that there are fundamental features of reality that escape our direct knowledge because of the natural limits of the human faculties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kant, Immanuel |title=Critique of Pure Reason |publisher= Prometheus Books |year=1990 |isbn= 0-87975-596-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a [[conceptual framework|conceptual]] or [[categorical framework]] on the stream of pure sensory dataâa framework including space and time themselvesâhe maintained that ''things-in-themselves'' existed independently of our perceptions and judgments; he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense. Indeed, Kant's account of ''things-in-themselves'' is both controversial and highly complex. Continuing his work, [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]] dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world, and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy.

The most notable work of this [[German idealism]] was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]'s ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', of 1807. Hegel admitted his ideas were not new, but that all the previous philosophies had been incomplete. His goal was to correctly finish their job. Hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience (which arise, for instance, out of the supposed contradictions between &quot;being&quot; and &quot;not being&quot;), and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination (&quot;being&quot; and &quot;not being&quot; are resolved with &quot;becoming&quot;). This program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the &quot;Hegelian [[dialectic]]&quot;. Philosophers in the Hegelian tradition include [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach]], who coined the term projection as pertaining to our inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things; [[Karl Marx]]; [[Friedrich Engels]]; and the [[British idealism|British idealists]], notably [[T. H. Green]], [[J. M. E. McTaggart]] and [[F. H. Bradley]].

Few 20th century philosophers have embraced idealism. However, quite a few have embraced Hegelian dialectic. Immanuel Kant's &quot;Copernican Turn&quot; also remains an important philosophical concept today.

===Pragmatism===
{{Main|Pragmatism|Instrumentalism}}
[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|[[William James]]]]
Pragmatism was founded in the spirit of finding a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight (revelation) or reference to some metaphysical realm. The truth of a statement should be judged by the effect it has on our actions, and truth should be seen as what the whole of scientific enquiry ultimately agrees on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Pragmatism â from Peirce to Davidson |author=Murphy, John P. |year=1990 |location=Boulder |publisher=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should probably be seen as a guiding principle more than a definition of what it means for something to be true, though the details of how this principle should be interpreted have been subject to discussion since Charles S. Peirce first conceived it. Peirce's [[Pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]] is as follows: &quot;Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conceptions of the object.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce on p. 293 of &quot;How to Make Our Ideas Clear&quot;, Popular Science Monthly, v. 12, pp. 286â302. Reprinted widely, including Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce (CP) v. 5, paragraphs 388â410.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[postmodern]] neo-pragmatist [[Richard Rorty]], many are convinced that pragmatism asserts that the truth of beliefs does not consist in their correspondence with reality, but in their usefulness and efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rorty&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Consequences of Pragmatism |author=Rorty, Richard |year=1982 |location=Minnesota |publisher=Minnesota University Press |page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late 19th-century [[American philosophy|American philosophers]] [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] were its co-founders, and it was later developed by [[John Dewey]] as [[instrumentalism]]. Since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance, Peirce and James conceptualised final truth as something only established by the future, final settlement of all opinion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Putnam&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Pragmatism: An Open Question |author=Putnam, Hilary |year=1995 |location= Oxford |publisher=Blackwell |pages=8â12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused pragmatism of falling victim to a simple fallacy: because something that is true proves useful, that usefulness is the basis for its truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pratt&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=What is Pragmatism? |author=Pratt, J. B. |year=1909 |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers in the pragmatist tradition have included John Dewey, [[George Santayana]], [[W. V. O. Quine]] and [[C. I. Lewis]]. Pragmatism has more recently been taken in new directions by Richard Rorty, [[John Lachs]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Susan Haack]], and [[Hilary Putnam]].

===Phenomenology===
{{Main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}
[[Edmund Husserl]]'s [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Woodruff Smith, David |title=Husserl |publisher=Routledge |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of Husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content, a feature that Husserl called ''[[intentionality]]''.&lt;ref name=Dreyfus&gt;{{cite book |author=Dreyfus, Hubert |title=A Companion to Phenomenology and Existentialism |publisher=Blackwell |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first part of his two-volume work, the ''Logical Investigations'' (1901), he launched an extended attack on [[psychologism]]. In the second part, he began to develop the technique of ''descriptive phenomenology'', with the aim of showing how objective judgments are indeed grounded in conscious experienceânot, however, in the first-person experience of particular individuals, but in the properties essential to any experiences of the kind in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;/&gt;

He also attempted to identify the essential properties of any act of meaning. He developed the method further in ''Ideas'' (1913) as ''transcendental phenomenology'', proposing to ground actual experience, and thus all fields of human knowledge, in the structure of consciousness of an ideal, or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]], ego. Later, he attempted to reconcile his transcendental standpoint with an acknowledgement of the intersubjective [[life-world]] in which real individual subjects interact. Husserl published only a few works in his lifetime, which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms; but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses.

Husserl's work was immediately influential in Germany, with the foundation of phenomenological schools in Munich and GÃ¶ttingen. Phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as [[Martin Heidegger]] (formerly Husserl's research assistant), [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Indeed, through the work of Heidegger and Sartre, Husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of [[existentialism]].

===Existentialism===
{{Main|Existentialism}}
[[File:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|[[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard]]]]
Existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of late 19th- and 20th-century philosophers who, despite profound doctrinal differences,&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pages 18â21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', ed. Ted Honderich, New York (1995), page 259.&lt;/ref&gt; shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subjectânot merely the thinking subject, but the acting, feeling, living human individual.&lt;ref&gt;John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'', New York (1972), pages 14â15.&lt;/ref&gt; In existentialism, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called &quot;the existential attitude&quot;, or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''Existentialism'' (McGraw-Hill, 1974, pages 1â2)&lt;/ref&gt; Many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy, in both style and content, as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Existentialism: From Dostoevesky to Sartre'', New York (1956) page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they did not use the term, the 19th-century philosophers [[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism. Their influence, however, has extended beyond existentialist thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Matustik, Martin J. |title=Kierkegaard in Post/Modernity |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-253-20967-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bob&gt;{{cite book |author=Solomon, Robert |title=What Nietzsche Really Said |year=2001 |isbn= 0-8052-1094-6 |publisher=Schocken}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Religious thinkers were among those influenced by Kierkegaard. Christian existentialists include [[Gabriel Marcel]], [[Nicholas Berdyaev]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], and [[Karl Jaspers]] (although he preferred to speak of his &quot;philosophical faith&quot;). The Jewish philosophers [[Martin Buber]] and [[Lev Shestov]] have also been associated with existentialism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main target of Kierkegaard's writings was the idealist philosophical system of [[Hegel]] which, he thought, ignored or excluded the inner subjective life of living human beings. Kierkegaard, conversely, held that &quot;truth is subjectivity&quot;, arguing that what is most important to an actual human being are questions dealing with an individual's inner relationship to existence. In particular, Kierkegaard, a Christian, believed that the truth of religious faith was a subjective question, and one to be wrestled with passionately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kierkegaard, SÃ¸ren |title=Fear and Trembling |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1986 |isbn=0-14-044449-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kierkegaard, SÃ¸ren |title=Concluding Unscientific Postscript |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-691-02081-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were among his influences, the extent to which the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In ''[[Being and Time]]'' he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (''Dasein'') to be analysed in terms of existential categories (''existentiale''); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement. However, in ''The Letter on Humanism'', Heidegger explicitly rejected the existentialism of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

Sartre became the best-known proponent of existentialism, exploring it not only in theoretical works such as ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', but also in plays and novels. Sartre, along with [[Simone de Beauvoir]], represented an avowedly atheistic branch of existentialism, which is now more closely associated with their ideas of nausea, contingency, bad faith, and the absurd than with Kierkegaard's spiritual angst. Nevertheless, the focus on the individual human being, responsible before the universe for the authenticity of his or her existence, is common to all these thinkers.

===Structuralism and post-structuralism===
{{Main|Structuralism|Post-structuralism}}
[[File:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]]]
Inaugurated by the linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], structuralism sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the [[discourse]]s they both limit and make possible. Saussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system, and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure, which articulates thought. This led continental thought away from humanism, and toward what was termed the decentering of man: language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self, but language speaks man.

Structuralism sought the province of a hard science, but its positivism soon came under fire by poststructuralism, a wide field of thinkers, some of whom were once themselves structuralists, but later came to criticize it. Structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external, objective standing, for example, but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect, that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines, while the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists, poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers, so meaning is always in a state of being deferred, making an ultimate interpretation impossible.

Structuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the 1960s and early '70s, encompassing thinkers as diverse as [[Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss]], [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. Post-structuralism came to predominate over the 1970s onwards, including thinkers such as [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and even [[Roland Barthes]]; it incorporated a critique of structuralism's limitations.

===The analytic tradition===
{{Main|Analytic philosophy}}
The term ''analytic philosophy'' roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation, attention to semantics, use of classical logic and non-classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria. Some have held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of our language, while some maintain that there are genuine philosophical problems and that philosophy is continuous with science. [[Michael Dummett]] in his ''Origins of Analytical Philosophy'' makes the case for counting [[Gottlob Frege]]'s ''The Foundations of Arithmetic'' as the first analytic work, on the grounds that in that book Frege took the linguistic turn, analyzing philosophical problems through language. [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G.E. Moore]] are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy, beginning with their rejection of British idealism, their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis. Russell's classic works ''The Principles of Mathematics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell |first=Bertrand |url=http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics |title='&amp;#39;The Principles of Mathematics'&amp;#39; (1903) |publisher=Fair-use.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[On Denoting]]'' and ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' with [[Alfred North Whitehead]], aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy, set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition, emphasizing such problems as: the reference of proper names, whether 'existence' is a property, the nature of propositions, the analysis of definite descriptions, the discussions on the foundations of mathematics; as well as exploring issues of ontological commitment and even metaphysical problems regarding time, the nature of matter, mind, persistence and change, which Russell tackled often with the aid of mathematical logic. Russell and Moore's philosophy, in the beginning of the 20th century, developed as a critique of [[Hegel]] and his British followers in particular, and of grand systems of [[speculative philosophy]] in general, though by no means all analytic philosophers reject the philosophy of Hegel (see [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]) nor speculative philosophy. Some schools in the group include [[logical positivism]], and [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language]] both markedly influenced by Russell and Wittgenstein's development of [[Logical Atomism]] the former positively and the latter negatively.

[[File:Ludwig Wittgenstein by Ben Richards.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]]]
In 1921, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who studied under Russell at Cambridge, published his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', which gave a rigidly &quot;logical&quot; account of linguistic and philosophical issues. At the time, he understood most of the problems of philosophy as mere puzzles of language, which could be solved by investigating and then minding the logical structure of language. Years later, he reversed a number of the positions he set out in the ''Tractatus'', in for example his second major work, ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' (1953). ''Investigations'' was influential in the development of &quot;ordinary language philosophy,&quot; which was promoted by [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[J.L. Austin]], and a few others. In the United States, meanwhile, the philosophy of [[W.V.O. Quine]] was having a major influence, with such classics as [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]. In that paper Quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements, arguing that a clear conception of analyticity is unattainable. He argued for holism, the thesis that language, including scientific language, is a set of interconnected sentences, none of which can be verified on its own, rather, the sentences in the language depend on each other for their meaning and truth conditions. A consequence of Quine's approach is that language as a whole has only a thin relation to experience. Some sentences that refer directly to experience might be modified by sense impressions, but as the whole of language is theory-laden, for the whole language to be modified, more than this is required. However, most of the linguistic structure can in principle be revised, even logic, in order to better model the world. Notable students of Quine include [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] and [[Daniel Dennett]]. The former devised a program for giving a semantics to natural language and thereby answer the philosophical conundrum &quot;what is meaning?&quot;. A crucial part of the program was the use of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s semantic theory of truth. Dummett, among others, argued that truth conditions should be dispensed within the theory of meaning, and replaced by assertibility conditions. Some propositions, on this view, are neither true nor false, and thus such a theory of meaning entails a rejection of the [[law of the excluded middle]]. This, for Dummett, entails antirealism, as Russell himself pointed out in his ''An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth''.

[[File:03-rawls-225.jpg|right|thumb|[[John Rawls]]]]
By the 1970s there was a renewed interest in many traditional philosophical problems by the younger generations of analytic philosophers. [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Derek Parfit]] and others took an interest in traditional metaphysical problems, which they began exploring by the use of logic and philosophy of language. Among those problems some distinguished ones were: free will, [[essentialism]], the nature of personal identity, identity over time, the nature of the mind, the nature of causal laws, space-time, the properties of material beings, modality, etc. In those universities where analytic philosophy has spread, these problems are still being discussed passionately. Analytic philosophers are also interested in the methodology of analytic philosophy itself, with [[Timothy Williamson]], Wykeham Professor of Logic at Oxford, publishing recently a book entitled ''The Philosophy of Philosophy''. Some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are: Timothy Williamson, [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], [[John Searle]], [[Thomas Nagel]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Michael Dummett]], [[Peter van Inwagen]] and [[Saul Kripke]]. Analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics. However, with the appearance of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' by [[John Rawls]] and ''[[Anarchy, State and Utopia]]'' by [[Robert Nozick]], analytic political philosophy acquired respectability. Analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics, with [[Roger Scruton]], [[Nelson Goodman]], [[Arthur Danto]] and others developing the subject to its current shape.

==Moral and political philosophy==
===Human nature and political legitimacy===
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|right|thumb|[[Thomas Hobbes]]]]
{{see also|Legitimacy (political)|Human nature}}
From ancient times, and well beyond them, the roots of justification for political authority were inescapably tied to outlooks on human nature. In ''The Republic'', [[Plato]] presented the argument that the ideal society would be run by a council of [[philosopher-king]]s, since those best at philosophy are best able to realize the good. Even Plato, however, required philosophers to make their way in the world for many years before beginning their rule at the age of fifty. For [[Aristotle]], humans are political animals (i.e. social animals), and governments are set up to pursue good for the community. Aristotle reasoned that, since the state (''[[polis]]'') was the highest form of community, it has the purpose of pursuing the highest good. Aristotle viewed political power as the result of natural inequalities in skill and virtue. Because of these differences, he favored an aristocracy of the able and virtuous. For Aristotle, the person cannot be complete unless he or she lives in a community. His ''The Nicomachean Ethics'' and ''The Politics'' are meant to be read in that order. The first book addresses virtues (or &quot;excellences&quot;) in the person as a citizen; the second addresses the proper form of government to ensure that citizens will be virtuous, and therefore complete. Both books deal with the essential role of justice in civic life.

[[Nicolas of Cusa]] rekindled Platonic thought in the early 15th century. He promoted democracy in Medieval Europe, both in his writings and in his organization of the Council of Florence. Unlike Aristotle and the Hobbesian tradition to follow, Cusa saw human beings as equal and divine (that is, made in God's image), so democracy would be the only just form of government. Cusa's views are credited by some as sparking the Italian Renaissance, which gave rise to the notion of &quot;Nation-States&quot;.

Later, [[NiccolÃ² Machiavelli]] rejected the views of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas as unrealistic. The ideal sovereign is not the embodiment of the moral virtues; rather the sovereign does whatever is successful and necessary, rather than what is morally praiseworthy. [[Thomas Hobbes]] also contested many elements of Aristotle's views. For Hobbes, human nature is essentially anti-social: people are essentially egoistic, and this egoism makes life difficult in the natural state of things. Moreover, Hobbes argued, though people may have natural inequalities, these are trivial, since no particular talents or virtues that people may have will make them safe from harm inflicted by others. For these reasons, Hobbes concluded that the state arises from a common agreement to raise the community out of the [[state of nature]]. This can only be done by the establishment of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], in which (or whom) is vested complete control over the community, and is able to inspire awe and terror in its subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hobbes, Thomas |title=Leviathan |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hegel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]]]
Many in the Enlightenment were unsatisfied with existing doctrines in political philosophy, which seemed to marginalize or neglect the possibility of a [[democracy|democratic state]]. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] was among those who attempted to overturn these doctrines: he responded to Hobbes by claiming that a human is by nature a kind of &quot;[[noble savage]]&quot;, and that society and social contracts corrupt this nature. Another critic was [[John Locke]]. In ''[[Two Treatises of Government|Second Treatise on Government]]'' he agreed with Hobbes that the nation-state was an efficient tool for raising humanity out of a deplorable state, but he argued that the sovereign might become an abominable institution compared to the relatively benign unmodulated state of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sigmund, Paul E. |title=The Selected Political Writings of John Locke |publisher=Norton |year=2005 |isbn=0-393-96451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the doctrine of the [[fact-value distinction]], due in part to the influence of [[David Hume]] and his student [[Adam Smith]], appeals to human nature for political justification were weakened. Nevertheless, many political philosophers, especially [[moral realism|moral realists]], still make use of some essential human nature as a basis for their arguments.

[[Marxism]] is derived from the work of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. Their idea that capitalism is based on exploitation of workers and causes alienation of people from their human nature, the [[historical materialism]], their view of [[social classes]], etc., have influenced many fields of study, such as sociology, economics, and politics. Marxism inspired the Marxist school of [[communism]], which brought a huge impact on the history of the 20th century.

===Consequentialism, deontology, and the aretaic turn===
{{Main|Consequentialism|Deontological ethics|Virtue ethics}}
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]
One debate that has commanded the attention of ethicists in the modern era has been between [[consequentialism]] (actions are to be morally evaluated solely by their ''consequences'') and [[deontology]] (actions are to be morally evaluated solely by consideration of agents' ''duties'', the ''rights'' of those whom the action concerns, or both).

[[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] are famous for propagating [[utilitarianism]], which is the idea that the fundamental moral rule is to strive toward the &quot;greatest happiness for the greatest number&quot;. However, in promoting this idea they also necessarily promoted the broader doctrine of consequentialism.

Adopting a position opposed to consequentialism, [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that moral principles were simply products of reason. Kant believed that the incorporation of consequences into moral deliberation was a deep mistake, since it denies the necessity of practical maxims in governing the working of the will. According to Kant, reason requires that we conform our actions to the [[categorical imperative]], which is an absolute duty. An important 20th-century deontologist, [[W.D. Ross]], argued for weaker forms of duties called [[prima facie duty|''prima facie'' duties]].

More recent works have emphasized the role of character in ethics, a movement known as the ''[[aretaic turn]]'' (that is, the ''turn towards virtues''). One strain of this movement followed the work of [[Bernard Williams]]. Williams noted that rigid forms of consequentialism and deontology demanded that people behave impartially. This, Williams argued, requires that people abandon their personal projects, and hence their personal [[integrity]], in order to be considered moral.

[[G.E.M. Anscombe]], in an influential paper, &quot;Modern Moral Philosophy&quot; (1958), revived [[virtue ethics]] as an alternative to what was seen as the entrenched positions of Kantianism and consequentialism. Aretaic perspectives have been inspired in part by research of ancient conceptions of virtue. For example, [[Aristotle's ethics]] demands that people follow the ''Aristotelian mean'', or balance between two vices; and [[Confucius|Confucian]] ethics argues that virtue consists largely in striving for harmony with other people. Virtue ethics in general has since gained many adherents, and has been defended by such philosophers as [[Philippa Foot]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], and [[Rosalind Hursthouse]].

==Applied philosophy==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[List of academic disciplines]]--&gt;
The ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs. The applied study of philosophy yields applications such as those in [[ethics]]â[[applied ethics]] in particularâand [[political philosophy]]. The political and economic philosophies of [[Confucius]], [[Sun Tzu|Sun Zi]], [[Chanakya]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Ibn Rushd]], [[Ibn Taimiyyah]], [[NiccolÃ² Machiavelli]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] and othersâall of these have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions.

In the field of [[philosophy of education]], progressive education as championed by [[John Dewey]] has had a profound impact on educational practices in the [[United States]] in the 20th century. Descendants of this movement include the current efforts in [[philosophy for children]], which are part of [[philosophy education]]. [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s political [[philosophy of war]] has had a profound effect on [[public administration|statecraft]], [[international politics]], and [[military strategy]] in the 20th century, especially in the years around [[World War II]]. Logic has become crucially important in [[mathematics]], [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[computer science]], and [[computer engineering]].

Other important applications can be found in [[epistemology]], which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge, sound evidence, and justified belief (important in [[law]], [[economics]], [[decision theory]], and a number of other disciplines). The [[philosophy of science]] discusses the underpinnings of the [[scientific method]] and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation. As such, philosophy has fundamental implications for science as a whole. For example, the strictly empirical approach of Skinner's behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the American psychological establishment. [[Deep ecology]] and [[animal rights]] examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non-human occupants to consider also. [[Aesthetics]] can help to interpret discussions of [[music]], [[literature]], the [[plastic arts]], and the whole artistic dimension of life. In general, the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields.

Often philosophy is seen as an investigation into an area not sufficiently well understood to be its own branch of knowledge. What were once philosophical pursuits have evolved into the modern day fields such as [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[linguistics]], and [[economics]], for example.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported an increase in philosophy majors at [[United States]] universities in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/education/06philosophy.html?em&amp;ex=1207713600&amp;en=6690d92b7d7470f8&amp;ei=5087%0A In a New Generation of College Students, Many Opt for the Life Examined].&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
