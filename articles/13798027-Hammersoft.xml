{{2003 Big Ten football standings}}
The '''2003 Iowa Hawkeyes football team''' represented the [[University of Iowa]] during the [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003 college football season]]. Following a [[2002 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|2002 season]] that saw the Hawkeyes finish 11-2 with a [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten championship]], expectations for a third straight [[bowl game|post-season game]] were well warranted.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIpreview&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Iowa Hawkeyes 2003 Preview|url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/2003/preview/teams/iowa/|publisher = SI.com|date = |accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; With four [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] starters and seven [[Defense (sport)|defensive]] starters returning from the 2002 season, the Hawkeyes looked to be a primarily defensive team going into the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIpreview&quot;/&gt;

The Hawkeyes opened the season strong, winning games over [[2003 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami]], {{cfb link|year=2003|team=Buffalo Bulls|title=Buffalo}}, {{cfb link|year=2003|team=Iowa State Cyclones|title=Iowa State}} and {{cfb link|year=2003|team=Arizona State Sun Devils|title=Arizona State}} en route to a 4-0 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;schedule&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa 2003 Football Schedule/Results|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teamsched?teamId=2294&amp;year=2003|publisher = ESPN|date = |accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undefeated and ranked ninth in the country, the Hawkeyes headed into [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]], [[Michigan]] for their [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] opener.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSUrecap&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Iowa vs. Michigan State|url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores103/103270/20030927NCAAFMICHIGANST0nr.htm|publisher = USA Today|date = 2003-09-27|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a [[2003 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State Spartans]] team that had just beaten [[2003 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] a week earlier, the Hawkeyes turned the ball over four times and committed ten penalties in a 20â10 loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSUrecap&quot;/&gt; However, with [[2003 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] next up on the schedule, things would get no easier for the Hawkeyes. Before the game, Michigan held a 37-9-4 lead in the series between the two teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMpreview1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa Returns Home to Host Michigan on Homecoming|url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/092903aab.html|publisher = HawkeyeSports.com|date = 2003-09-29|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a loss to [[2003 Purdue Boilermakers football team|Purdue]], Iowa's record was 7-3 with two regular season games remaining.&lt;ref name=&quot;schedule&quot;/&gt; Playing against [[2003 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]] and the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]]'s top-ranked offense, the Hawkeyes scored 33 points before the Gophers scored a [[touchdown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Minnrecap&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Minnesota vs. Iowa|url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores103/103319/20031115NCAAFIOWA------0nr.htm|publisher = USA Today|date = 2003-11-15|accessdate = 2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 40â22 victory, the Hawkeyes fell behind unranked [[2003 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] 21â7 during the second quarter. Needing a pass deflection in the [[end zone]] by [[Sean Considine]] with no time remaining, the Hawkeyes scored 20 straight points and escaped with a 27â21 win and a 9-3 regular season record.&lt;ref name=&quot;UWrecap&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Iowa vs. Wisconsin|url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores103/103326/20031122NCAAFWISCONSIN-0nr.htm|publisher = USA Today|date = 2003-11-22|accessdate = 2003-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing in the [[2004 Outback Bowl]] on January 1, 2004, the Hawkeyes won their first game in the state of [[Florida]] with a 37â17 victory over the [[2003 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]]. The win was also Iowa's first in the month of January since [[1959]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UFrecap&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Iowa vs. Florida|url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores104/104001/20040101NCAAFFLORIDA---0nr.htm|publisher = USA Today|date = 2004-01-01|accessdate = 2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
