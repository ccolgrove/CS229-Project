{{nihongo|'''Seigo Narazaki'''|æ¥¢ï¨ æ­£å|Narazaki SeigÅ|extra=born April 15, 1976 in [[Kashiba, Nara|Kashiba]], [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]]}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[football (soccer)|football]] player, who currently plays for [[J. League Division 1]] side [[Nagoya Grampus]]. He is a goalkeeper and a member of the [[Japan national football team|Japanese national football team]].

==Playing career==
After graduating from Nara Ikuei High School in 1995, he joined J. League side [[Yokohama FlÃ¼gels]]. He became the No. 1 GK for the club in August of that season. His first professional appearance came on August 16, 1995 in a league match against [[Shonan Bellmare|Bellmare Hiratsuka]]. He contributed to the club winning the [[Emperor's Cup]] in 1998. When FlÃ¼gels was merged with cross-town [[Yokohama F. Marinos|Yokohama Marinos]] in 1999, he was signed by [[Nagoya Grampus|Nagoya Grampus Eight]]. He was again a member of the Emperor's Cup winning side in 1999 but this time with Nagoya.

He made his international debut for Japan on February 15, 1998 against [[Australia national football team|Australia]]. He participated in three consecutive [[FIFA World Cup]] finals. He played all the Japan matches in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] finals although [[Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi]] was preferred ahead of him in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/teams/team=43819.html FIFA.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

He played for Japan as the No.1 goalkeeper following an injury to Kawaguchi, but himself sustained a broken finger in 2009. After recovering, he was named in the [[2010 World Cup]] squad [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sw20100510x1.html] as one of two Japanese players (the other being Kawaguchi) to participate in 4 consecutive World Cups. However, despite performing impressively in the qualifiers, he was benched for the tournament in favour of his former understudy [[Eiji Kawashima]]. He would make one last appearance for Japan when he captained the team to a 2-1 victory over Guatemala on 7 September 2010 before retiring from international duty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.47news.jp/CN/201009/CN2010090701001127.html Narazaki retires from international duty]&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1299632.html] 

In 2010, Narazaki became the first goalkeeper to receive the [[J. League Most Valuable Player]] award.
