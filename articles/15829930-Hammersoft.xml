==Cricket academy in Chennai==
Former Chennai Super Kings' opener and 2009 Orange Cap-holder, [[Matthew Hayden]] has planned to set up a youth academy in Chennai and wants to take the help of Rahul Dravid and his Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming in the venture.&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo&quot;&gt;[http://www.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/416183.html Cricket Academy in Chennai]&lt;/ref&gt; Hayden said he had decided to give back to the city where he had practiced playing on turning tracks ten years ago on Australia's 2000â01 tour to India.&quot;About a decade back, when I came here to practise on turning tracks, I told myself standing in an empty Chepauk stadium that I would score a century for Australia one day,&quot; Hayden told the Times of India. &quot;I did that, and now this is a way of giving something back to the city from where I have got so much.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cricinfo&quot;/&gt;

==Financial worth==
The Economic Times commissioned UK-based [[Brand Finance]] to carry out brand evaluation of the IPL and also each of the eight franchise teams (that has been increased to 10 in 2011).
Chennai Super Kings has been rated as 2010â2011 âmost valuable teamâ in Indian Premier League cricket, with a brand value of US$48.4 million (app {{INR}} 224 crores).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chennaisuperkings.com/News/NewsContent.aspx?NewsID=202 IPL Brand Value]&lt;/ref&gt; which is 2.4 million more than Kolkata Knight Riders, whose brand value stood at $46 million.

In 2011,a survey conducted by Rediff indicated that Super kings were once again the most valuable franchise in the tournament with a brand valuation of $ 70.16 million.This comes as a surprise as the brand value of the tournament itself had crashed down by $460 million and most of the other franchises had registered huge losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-ipl-brand-value-crashes/20110408.htm |title=Corruption hits IPL, brand value falls to $3.67 billion - Rediff.com Business |publisher=Rediff.com |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
