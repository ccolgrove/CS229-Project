<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="211373" ns="0" title="Committee for the Liberation of Iraq"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''Committee for the Liberation of Iraq''' ('''CLI''') was described as a &quot;[[non-governmental organization]]&quot; which described itself as a &quot;distinguished group of Americans&quot; who wanted to &quot;free [[Iraq]] from [[Saddam Hussein]]&quot;. In a news release announcing its formation, the group said its goal was to &quot;promote regional peace, political freedom and international security through replacement of the Saddam Hussein regime with a democratic government that respects the rights of the Iraqi people and ceases to threaten the community of nations.&quot; It had close links to the [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) and the [[American Enterprise Institute]] (AEI), important shapers of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s foreign policy.

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported in November 2002 that &quot;the organization is modeled on a successful lobbying campaign to expand the NATO alliance. Members include former secretary of state [[George P. Shultz]], Sen. [[John McCain]] (R-Ariz.) and former senator [[Bob Kerrey]] (D-Neb.). ... While the Iraq committee is an independent entity, committee officers said they expect to work closely with the administration. They already have met with Hadley and Bush political adviser [[Karl Rove]]. Committee officers and a White House spokesman said [[Condoleezza Rice|Rice]], Hadley and [[Dick Cheney|Cheney]] will soon meet with the group.&quot; [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64233-2002Nov3?language=printer]

With the successful [[2003 invasion of Iraq|removal of Saddam Hussein]], the committee appears to have disbanded, and its once-prominent website no longer exists. However, its offices still remain on Pennsylvania Avenue and 10th Street.

The film ''[[Syriana]]'' portrays a similar group, using the same initials, but bearing the name 'Committee for the Liberation of ''[[Iran]]'''.
