'''Nicole LeFavour''' (born February 8, 1964) is an [[Politics of the United States|American politician]] and educator from [[Idaho]], currently serving in the  [[Idaho Senate]]. Elected to the Senate in 2008, she had previously served four years in the [[Idaho House of Representatives]].

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], LeFavour was first elected to District 19's Seat B in the State House of Representatives in 2004, succeeding long-time Democratic incumbent Ken Robison, who retired. The 19th district, which she now represents in the Senate, is contained within [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] and includes the city's North End, East End, Downtown and Foothills neighborhoods. She won the three-way Democratic primary with more than 54 percent of the vote and went on to defeat her [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent by more than two-to-one. In 2006, she ran unopposed for re-election.

Following [[F. Michael Burkett|Mike Burkett]]'s announcement that he would be retiring from the [[Idaho Senate]], LeFavour announced on March 8, 2008 her intent to run for the District 19 senate seat. She did not draw a primary election opponent but faced a Republican, Chuck Meissner, in the November general election.

LeFavour defeated Meissner with over 70 percent of the vote. Former [[Ada County, Idaho|Ada County]] Democratic Party chair Brian C. Cronin, whom LeFavour defeated in the 2004 primary, was elected to succeed her in the Idaho House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.idaho.gov/elect/RESULTS/2008/General/tot_leg.htm November 4, 2008 General Election Results Legislative Totals]&lt;/ref&gt;
