'''Sir Donald Henry Pleasence''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], (5 October 1919 &amp;ndash; 2 February 1995) was a British actor who gained more than 200 screen credits during a career which spanned over four decades. Known for his piercing blue eyes and bald head, Pleasence is arguably best remembered for his work in the ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'' and ''[[James Bond]]'' franchises.

==Early life==
Pleasence was born in [[Worksop]], [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]], the son of Alice ([[married and maiden names|nÃ©e]] Armitage) and Thomas Stanley Pleasence, a railway stationmaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ross|first=Helen|authorlink=|coauthors=Lillian Ross|title= The Player: A Profile of an Art|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1962|location=|page=256|month=|url=|id=ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in the small village of [[Grimoldby]], [[Lincolnshire]], and raised a strict [[Methodist]].&lt;ref name=ref09/&gt; Pleasence attended [[Ecclesfield School|Ecclesfield Grammar School]], in [[Sheffield]], [[Yorkshire]], and subsequently dropped out to work as a railway clerk, whilst looking for a job as an actor.&lt;ref name=ref09&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/playeraprofileof002609mbp/playeraprofileof002609mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of &quot;The Player A Profile Of An Art&quot; |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]] Pleasence was initially a [[conscientious objector]], but later changed his stance and was commissioned into the [[Royal Air Force]], serving with  [[No. 166 Squadron RAF|166 Squadron]], [[RAF Bomber Command]]. His [[Avro Lancaster]] was shot down on 31 August 1944 during a raid on Agenville.&lt;ref&gt;Chorley, W.R. (1997), ''Royal Air Force Bomber Command Losses of the Second World War, Volume 5: 1944; p 407''. Midland Counties Publications, UK. ISBN 0-904597-91-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken prisoner and placed in a German prisoner-of-war camp, where he produced and acted in plays. He would later play Flight Lt. Colin Blythe in ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' where much of the story takes place inside a German POW camp.

==Career==
===Cinema===
Pleasence's acting career began in a production of ''Wuthering Heights'', but was interrupted by World War II. Pleasence returned to acting after the war, and critics began to call him the &quot;Man with the Hypnotic Eye&quot;.  Equipped with a shiny bald head and a quiet but intense voice to go with his trademark penetrating gaze, he specialised in portraying insane or evil characters, including the violent alcoholic Doc Tydon in ''[[Wake in Fright]]'' (1971), the mad Doctor in the [[Bud Spencer]]-[[Terence Hill]] movie ''[[Watch Out, We're Mad]]'' (1974), [[Heinrich Himmler]] in ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (film)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' (1976), and the Bond arch-villain [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967), the first film in which the villain's face is clearly seen. His interpretation of the character has become predominate in popular culture considering the popularity of the comic villain, [[Dr. Evil]] in the successful ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]]'' film series, which primarily parodies it.

Perhaps his most sympathetic screen role was as the tragic POW Colin Blythe in the 1963 film ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'', who discovers that he is slowly going blind, but nonetheless participates in the mass break-out, only to be shot down by German soldiers because he is unable to see them. In ''[[The Night of the Generals]]'' (1967), he played another uncharacteristically sympathetic role, this time as an old-school German general involved in a [[20 July plot|plot]] to kill [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. In 1971, he returned to the realm of the deranged, delivering a ''tour de force'' performance in the role of an alcoholic Australian doctor in [[Ted Kotcheff]]'s nightmarish outback drama ''[[Wake in Fright]]''. 

Pleasence played [[Lucifer]] (taking on several human disguises) in the religious [[epic film|epic]] ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965). He was one of many stars who were given [[cameo appearance|cameos]] throughout the film. Perhaps his most bizarre and powerful film role occurred in Polanski's ''[[Cul-de-sac (1966 film)|Cul-de-sac]]'' (1966), in which he portrayed the love-sodden husband of a much younger French wife ([[FranÃ§oise DorlÃ©ac]]). In 1968, he ventured successfully into American cowboy territory, playing a sadistic self-styled preacher who goes after stoic [[Charlton Heston]] in the Western ''[[Will Penny]]''. 

In his later years, he became best known to a younger generation of cinema-goers as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Loomis]] in ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' (1978). The distinctive, rather sinister accent that he employs in this and other movies may be credited to the [[elocution]] lessons that he had as a child. He reprised his role as Dr. Loomis in ''[[Halloween II]]'' (1981), ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers|IV]]'' (1988), ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers|V]]'' (1989) and ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers|VI]]'' (1995).

His acting hero was [[Laurence Olivier|Sir Laurence Olivier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pleasence.com/BIO-DP.HTML |title=Donald Pleasence'S Biography |publisher=Pleasence.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he worked on-stage in the 1950s, and later on the 1979 movie version of ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]''. Two years earlier, Pleasence did an amusingly broad impersonation of Olivier in the guise of a horror-film actor called &quot;Valentine De'ath&quot; in the film ''[[The Uncanny (film)|The Uncanny]]''.

===Television===
One of his earliest roles on television was as Syme in the [[BBC]]'s highly acclaimed 1954 adaptation of [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four (TV programme)|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. This adaptation also starred [[Peter Cushing]], another British actor who would go on to find fame in many horror-film roles. Pleasence played [[John of England|Prince John]] in several episodes of the [[ITV]] series ''[[The Adventures of Robin Hood (TV series)|The Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1956â1958). He appeared twice with [[Patrick McGoohan]] in the British spy series, ''[[Danger Man]]'', in episodes &quot;Position of Trust&quot; (1960) and &quot;Find and Return&quot; (1961). His first appearance in America was in an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', playing an aging (and suicidal) teacher at a boys' school in the episode &quot;[[The Changing of the Guard (The Twilight Zone)|The Changing of the Guard]]&quot; (1962). In 1963, he appeared in an episode of ''The Outer Limits'' entitled &quot;[[The Man With the Power]]&quot;. He hosted the 1981 Halloween episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with music guest [[Fear (band)|Fear]] (which, because of Fear's raucous performance and the ultra-dark humour of the sketches, hasn't been seen on television since its first airing).

In 1973 Pleasence played the murderer in an episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' entitled [[List of Columbo episodes#Season 3|&quot;Any Old Port in a Storm&quot;]]. He also had the distinction of playing a culprit captured by ''Mrs. Columbo'' in &quot;Murder is a Parlor Game&quot; (1979). Pleasence provided the voice-over for the British [[Public Information Film]], ''[[Lonely Water|The Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water]]'' in 1973. The film, intended to warn children of the dangers of playing near water, attained notoriety for allegedly giving children [[nightmares]]. Pleasence starred as the Reverend Septimus Harding in the BBC's 1982 TV serial ''[[The Barchester Chronicles]]''.

===Spoken records===
During the early 1960s, he recorded several children's-story records on the [[Atlas Record]] label. These were marketed as the [[Talespinners]] series in the UK. They were also released in the USA as [[Tale Spinners For Children]] by [[United Artists Records|United Artists]]. The stories included ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and the ''[[Brave Little Tailor]]''.

===Books===
Pleasence was the author of the 1977 children's book ''[[Scouse the Mouse]]'' (London: New English Library), which was animated by Canadian animator/film director [[Gerald Potterton]] (a friend of the actor, who directed him in the 1973 Canadian film ''The Rainbow Boys'', retitled ''The Rainbow Gang'' for VHS release in the United States) and also adapted into a children's recording ([[Polydor Records]], 1977) with [[Ringo Starr]] voicing the book's title character, Scouse the Mouse.

===Awards===
Pleasence was nominated four times for the [[Tony Award]] for best performance by a leading actor in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play: in 1962 for [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[The Caretaker]]'', in 1965 for [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Poor Bitos]]'', in 1969 for [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]'s ''[[The Man in the Glass Booth]]'', and in 1972 for [[Simon Gray]]'s ''[[Wise Child]]''. 

He was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his services to the acting profession by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1994.

==Personal life==
Pleasence married four times and had five daughters from his first three marriages. He was married to Miriam Raymond in 1947â1958, and they had [[Angela Pleasence|Angela]] and Jean. His 1959â1970 marriage to actress and singer Josephine Martin Crombie produced Lucy and Polly. He was married to Meira Shore in 1970â1988 and they had a daughter, Miranda. His last marriage to Linda Kentwood lasted until his death in 1995 and was without issue.

==Death==
Pleasence died at the age of 75 in [[Saint-Paul, Alpes-Maritimes|Saint-Paul-de-Vence]], [[France]], from complications of [[heart failure]] following [[heart valve]] replacement surgery. He was [[cremated]].

==Legacy==
''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' and ''[[Halloween H20: Twenty Years Later]]'', were both dedicated to the memory of Pleasence, the latter of which he did not appear in.

[[Dr. Evil]], the character played by [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]] in the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] comedy films (1997â2002), is a parody of Pleasence's performance as Blofeld in ''You Only Live Twice''.
