{{Islam}}

[[progressivism|Progressive]] [[Muslims]] have produced a considerable body of [[liberalism|liberal thought]] within [[Islam]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Liberal Muslim Conference&quot;&gt;[http://www.aim.org/guest-column/finally-muslims-speak-out-against-jihad Finally: Muslims Speak Out Against Jihad]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Essays by Muslims&quot;&gt;Safi, O: &quot;Progressive Muslims&quot;, One World: Oxford, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;progressive Islam&quot; ({{lang-ar|Ø§ÙØ¥Ø³ÙØ§Ù Ø§ÙØªÙØ¯ÙÙ}}); but some consider progressive Islam and liberal Islam as two distinct movements&lt;ref name=&quot;differences prog liberal&quot;&gt;[http://www.averroes-foundation.org/articles/progressive_islam.html Averroes Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;). The methodology of reform can be classified into two groups, one depending on re-interpreting the traditional texts which constitutes Islamic law ([[ijtihad]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;ijtihad&quot;&gt;Aslan, R: &quot;No god but God&quot;, Random House, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; this varies widely from little deviation from the traditional interpretation, to the more liberal which considers only the meaning of Qur'an as a divine inspiration, while the wording is believed to be from the prophet Muhammad intended by him to suit his time and situation, therefore interpreting the problematic verses in modern times allegorically or even not considering them. The second is questioning the authentic status applied to texts by the Traditional Islamic Scholars, resulting in the most liberal case as of the [[Qur'an Alone]] Muslims in rejecting the Islamic narratives of the sayings and practises of [[Prophet Muhammad]], namely the [[Hadith]] completely.

The most liberal Muslim intellectuals who focused on religious reform include [[Sayyid al-Qimni]], [[Nasr Abu Zayd]], [[Abdolkarim Soroush]], [[Mohammed Arkoun]], [[Mohammed Shahrour]], [[Ahmed Subhy Mansour]], [[Edip Yuksel]], [[Gamal al-Banna]], [[Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im]], [[Ahmed Al-Gubbanchi]], [[Mahmoud Mohammed Taha]], and [[Faraj Foda]], the last two were killed after [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy claims]] which most of them have been accused of by traditional Islamic scholars.

Some liberal Muslims claim that they are returning to the principles of the early [[Ummah]] and to the ethical and pluralistic intent of their scripture, the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Imam speech against extremism&quot;&gt;[http://www.mcb.org.uk/media/speech_10_12_01.php Muslim Council of Britain]&lt;/ref&gt; They distance themselves from some traditional and less liberal interpretations of Islamic law, as they consider these to be culturally based and without universal applicability. The reform movement uses [[monotheism]] (''tawhid'') &quot;as an organizing principle for human society and the basis of religious knowledge, history, metaphysics, aesthetics, and ethics, as well as social, economic and world order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2356?_hi=15&amp;_pos=2 From the article on Tawhid in Oxford Islamic Studies Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reform ==
These are movements within Islam, rather than an attempt at schism. As such, they believe in the basic tenets of Islam, such as the [[Six articles of belief|Six Elements of Belief]] and the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. They consider their views to be fully compatible with the teachings of Islam. Their main differences with more conservative Islamic opinion are two, the first is, in differences of interpretation of how to apply the core Islamic values to modern life,&lt;ref name=&quot;Islam in the modern world&quot;&gt;[http://www.important.ca/islam_in_the_modern_world.html Islam in the modern world]&lt;/ref&gt; the second includes a more reactionary dialectic which criticizes traditional narratives or even rejects them, hence, denying any obligation to follow them while also allowing greater freedoms in interpreting Qur'an regardless of the [[hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;From the article [http://www.chron.com/channel/houstonbelief/commons/aliberalmuslimblog.html?plckController=Blog&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;newspaperUserId=a85cee4e-2a0d-4f7f-86fb-89c76240a84f&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3aa85cee4e-2a0d-4f7f-86fb-89c76240a84fPost%3a0143e5e6-cc3d-41bb-89b5-b41d69bce1cf&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest Where We Went Wrong: A Hard Look at Hadith] by Jamal Khawaja&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim liberals focus on individual autonomy in the interpretation of the Qur'an and ethics rather than focusing on the literal interpretation of the Qur'an. This thinking may have a precedent in the traditions of [[Sufi]] and Islamic mysticism&lt;ref name=&quot;Sufis and anti-Sufis&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=taESmRsDlo4C&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22individual+interpretation%22+Sufi+tradition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=W-9GDq0LHB&amp;sig=mwdl4mPOTI_m0LNMDedA6WfqbI8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pvbDSveuJ9LX-Qb7l-juCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false &quot;Sufis and anti-Sufis&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; although different in many ways, including the purpose of interpretation.

== Central tenets ==
Several generally accepted tenets have emerged:

* The autonomy of the individual in interpreting the [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]].&lt;ref name=&quot;About Liberal Islam Network&quot;&gt;[http://islamlib.com/en/pages/about About Liberal Islam]&lt;/ref&gt; More liberal trends include rejecting [[Hadith]]s completely (like [[Qur'an Alone]] Muslims) or partially (including hadiths considered authentic ([[Sahih]]) by traditionalists) like [[Gamal Al-Banna]].
* A more critical and diverse examination of religious texts, as well as traditional Islamic precedents.
* Complete gender equality in all aspects, including ritual prayer and observance.
* A more open view on modern culture in relation to customs, dress, and common practices. Certain rules on modesty amongst men and women are still self-enforced in response to the Qur'an's injunction against immodest dress.
* The individual use of [[ijtihad]] (interpretation) and [[fitrah]] (natural sense of right and wrong) is advocated.

== Contemporary and controversial issues ==
Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, in accordance with their increasingly modern societies and outlooks, liberal Muslims have tended to reinterpret many aspects of the application of their religion in their life in an attempt to reconnect with the original message, untouched by harmful cultural influences. This is particularly true of Muslims who now find themselves living in non-Muslim countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Being a Muslim in the U.S.&quot;&gt;[http://islamlib.com/en/article/being-a-muslim-in-the-us Being a Muslim in the U.S.Ø§]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Such people may describe themselves variously as liberal, progressive, or reformist (in application but not in the tenets of the faith); but rather than implying a specific agenda, these terms tend to incorporate a broad spectrum of views which contest conservative, traditional interpretations of Islam in many different ways. Although there is no full consensus amongst liberal Muslims on their views, they tend to agree on some or all of the following beliefs:

=== Ijtihad ===
This means that liberal Muslims often drop traditional interpretations of the [[Qur'an]] which they find too culturally conservative and relative, preferring instead readings which are more adaptable to modern society (see [[ijtihad]]). Most liberal Muslims reject derivation of Islamic laws from literal readings of single Qur'anic verses. They generally claim that a holistic view which takes into account the 7th century Arabian cultural context allows deeper insight into the manner in which the commands of God (Allah) are carried out.

=== Human rights ===
{{See|Human rights in Islamic countries}}
Moderate Islamic political thought contends that the nurturing of the Muslim identity and the propagation of values such as democracy and Human rights are not mutually exclusive, but rather should be promoted together.&lt;ref name=&quot;giovannini&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vl-8rypoHY0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA162&amp;ots=hF0UW7zB2U&amp;sig=vgYxMHlG-oPZ04XTW73_mvC7Tds#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Fundamentalist City?: Religiosity and the Remaking of Urban Space], Nezar Alsayyad (ed.), Chapter 7: &quot;Hamas in Gaza Refugee camps: The Construction of Trapped Spaces for the Survival of Fundamentalism&quot;, Francesca Giovannini. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2010. ISBN 9780415779364.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Most liberal Muslims believe that Islam promotes the notion of absolute equality of all humanity, and that it is one of its central concepts. Therefore, a breach of [[human rights]] has become a source of great concern to most liberal Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;human rights&quot;&gt;Hassan Mahmoud Khalil: &quot;Islam's position on violence and violation of human rights&quot;, Dar Al-Shaeb, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[Human Rights]] is perceived to be of the utmost concern of all devoted adherents to the Islamic faith, liberal Muslims differ with their culturally conservative counterparts in that they believe that all humanity is represented under the umbrella of [[Human Rights]]. Many Muslim majority countries have signed international human rights treaties, but the impact of these largely remains to be seen in local legal systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soft Power for the Islamic Movement&quot;&gt;[http://islamlib.com/en/article/soft-power-for-the-islamic-movement The Soft Power for the Islamic Movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim liberals often reject traditional interpretations of Islamic law, which allows [[Ma malakat aymanukum]] and [[Slavery]]. They see that [[Slavery]] opposed Islamic principles which they believe to be based on justice and equality and verses relating to slavery or &quot;Ma malakat aymanukum&quot; now can not be applied due to the fact that the world has changed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Writer and Islamic thinker &quot;Gamal al-Banna&quot;: The Muslim Brotherhood is not fit to rule (2-2)&quot;&gt;[http://www.ahewar.org/debat/show.art.asp?aid=125503 Writer and Islamic thinker &quot;Gamal al-Banna&quot;: The Muslim Brotherhood is not fit to rule (2-2)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Writer and Islamic thinker &quot;Gamal al-Banna&quot;: The Muslim Brotherhood is not fit to rule (1-2)&quot;&gt;[http://www.ahewar.org/debat/show.art.asp?aid=125296 Writer and Islamic thinker &quot;Gamal al-Banna&quot;: The Muslim Brotherhood is not fit to rule (1-2)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the framework of justice and equality for all, Muslim liberals include gay rights as a human right.

=== Feminism ===
[[File:Islamic Feminism Symbol.svg|thumb|Islamic Feminism Symbol]]

The place of [[women in Islam]], traditional [[gender roles in Islam]] and [[Islamic feminism]] are likewise major issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/channel/houstonbelief/commons/aliberalmuslimblog.html?plckController=Blog&amp;plckBlogPage=BlogViewPost&amp;newspaperUserId=a85cee4e-2a0d-4f7f-86fb-89c76240a84f&amp;plckPostId=Blog%3aa85cee4e-2a0d-4f7f-86fb-89c76240a84fPost%3a4de8ceb9-da78-43c8-8d0c-357532eee1aa&amp;plckScript=blogScript&amp;plckElementId=blogDest A History of Women in Islam], By Jamal Khawaja&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, liberal Muslims are often critical of traditional Islamic law interpretations which allow [[polygyny]] for men but not [[polyandry]] for women, as well as the traditional [[Sharia|Islamic law]] of [[inheritance]] under which daughters receive less than sons. Traditional Muslims believe this is balanced by the right of a wife to her husband's money, whereas the husband does not have a right to his wife's money. 

It is also accepted by most liberal Muslims that a woman may lead the state, and that women should not be segregated from men in society or in masjids.  Some traditional Muslims also accept a woman as a leader of state so long as it does not conflict with her obligation to family. A small minority of liberal Muslims accept that a woman may lead a mixed group in prayers, despite the established custom for women to pray behind or in a separate space.  However, this issue remains controversial; see [[women as imams]].  Some Muslim [[Feminism|feminists]] are also opposed to the traditional dress requirements for women (commonly called [[hijab]]), claiming that any modest clothing is sufficiently Islamic for both men and women. 

Other Muslim feminists embrace hijab, pointing out its tendency to de-sexualize women and therefore assist them in being treated less as an object and more as a person. Furthermore, some Muslim feminists prefer to wear the hijab as an obvious sign that they are indeed Muslim, while also feminists. Most -but not all- schools of Islamic law require women to cover all but the hands and the face, while men are only required to cover from the navel to the knee. Traditional reports of the prophet, called hadith, are used to support the idea of covering everything on a woman except her face and hands. The reported story is told that the prophet saw Asma clothed in a thin garment, at which he proclaimed: &quot;when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, she should cover everything but&quot;- and he then pointed to his face and hands. The Qur'an itself requires men and women to dress modestly (see: Qur'an 24:30-31). The words &quot;bosom/chest&quot; and &quot;modest&quot; are found in 24:31, however the word &quot;hair&quot; is absent. In the same verse woman are advised to not &quot;strike their feet&quot; as to draw attention to their hidden adornment. This leaves &quot;adornment&quot; (sometimes translated as beauty) open to interpretation, as to whether it includes the hair.

=== Secularism ===
{{Main|Secularism in the Middle East}}

Some liberal Muslims favor the idea of modern [[secularism|secular]] democracy with [[separation of church and state]], and thus oppose [[Islam as a political movement]]. 

The existence or applicability of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] is questioned by many liberals. Their argument often involves variants of the [[Mu'tazili]] theory that the Qur'an was created by God for the particular circumstances of the early Muslim community, and reason must be used to apply it to new contexts.

===Tolerance and non-violence===
[[Toleration|Tolerance]] is another key tenet of Liberal Muslims, who are generally open to interfaith dialogue and conflict resolution with such communities as Jews, Christians, Hindus, and the numerous factions within Islam.

Liberal Muslims are more likely to reflect the idea of [[jihad]] in terms of the widely accepted &quot;internal spiritual struggle&quot; rather than an &quot;armed struggle.&quot; The ideals of [[non-violence]] are prevalent in Liberal Muslim ideology and backed by Qu'ranic text; &quot;permission to fight is given only to those who have been oppressed... who have been driven from their homes for saying, 'God is our Lord'&quot; (22:39)

===Reliance on secular scholarship===
Liberal Muslims{{Who|date=May 2008}} tend to be skeptical about the validity of [[Islamization of knowledge]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} (including [[Islamic economics]], [[Islamic science]], [[Islamic history]] and [[Islamic philosophy]]) as separate from mainstream fields of inquiry. This is usually due to the often secular outlook of Muslim liberals, which makes them more disposed to trust mainstream secular scholarship. They may also regard the propagation of these fields as merely a propaganda move by Muslim conservatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Viability of Islamic Science&quot;&gt;S.
