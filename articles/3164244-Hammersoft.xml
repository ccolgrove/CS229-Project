The '''JeffersonâEppes Trophy''' is awarded to the winner of the American [[college football]] game played by the [[Florida State Seminoles football]] team of [[Florida State University]] and the [[Virginia Cavaliers football]] team of the [[University of Virginia]].  The trophy was created in 1995 and was named for former [[President of the United States|United States President]] and founder of the [[University of Virginia]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and Jefferson's grandson [[Francis W. Eppes|Francis W. Eppes VII]], a three-time mayor of [[Tallahassee]] and president of the Board of Trustees of the [[Florida State University|West Florida Seminary]], now Florida State University.

Although the game is played for a trophy, it is not considered a significant rivalry.  Virginia's biggest rivalries are with [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] for the [[Commonwealth Cup]] and [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]] in the [[South's Oldest Rivalry]]. FSU's most meaningful rivalries are with [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] in the [[Florida â Florida State football rivalry|FloridaâFlorida State game]] and [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] in the [[Miami â Florida State football rivalry|MiamiâFlorida State game]]. When the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] split into divisions in 2005, the annual rivalry between Florida State and Virginia ceased, as the Seminoles were assigned to the Atlantic Division and the Cavaliers to the Coastal Division. Though each team in the ACC plays an annual game against one designated cross-divisional rival, both teams' more historic rivals were awarded these positions ([[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]] for Virginia, Miami for Florida State). As a result, Florida State and Virginia have not played on an annual basis since 2006.

The most recent meeting took place on November 19, 2011, with Virginia winning 14â13 in Tallahassee.

== Origin ==

The idea for the JeffersonâEppes Trophy was conceived by Florida State University President [[Talbot D'Alemberte]]. [http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/textonlyarchive/September_1996/football.txt UVA link]

== Construction ==
The trophy is composed of an intricately wrought silver pitcher presented to the city of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] by Eppes in 1842 and set upon a wood base made of remains of the [[McGuffey Ash]], which was once the largest tree on the Grounds of the University of Virginia but suffered a fatal tree disease in 1990. The trophy was designed by famed artist Ryan Parker.
