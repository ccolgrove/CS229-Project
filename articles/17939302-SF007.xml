'''WinBuilder''' is a free application designed to build and customize boot disks ([[Live CD]]s) based on [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[WinPE]]).

==Scripts==
Scripts are the building blocks of Live CD compiled with Winbuilder are used to build the core components of the Live CD, for adding applications, and for configuration of a specific project. 
Scripts consist of a human readable text file with the .script extension and can contain Winbuilder scripting commands, the scripts graphical user interface, and sometimes encoded applications to be extracted when needed.

There is a paper explaining in detail the scripting framework of WinBuilder at [http://www.slideshare.net/nunobrito/explaining-the-winbuilder-framework Slideshare] that provides a comprehensive description of how it works.

==Projects==
A Project is a collection of Winbuilder scripts maintained for building a complete Live CD. Each project contains multiple scripts, each responsible for adding features or applications to the build.

Users may build their own projects from scratch or use one of many projects actively developed by the boot-land community. Projects can be downloaded directly using Winbuilder's built-in download manager and used as-is or further customized to meet the individual's needs.

All of these projects are developed and distributed freely and aim to provide an alternative to other popular [[Live CD]] distributions based on Linux such as [[Knoppix]], [[Slax]], [[Damn Small Linux]], which are known for their use in rescue or administrative actions on PCs.

== Use and reception ==

Use of the software to build various customized boot disks has been covered in articles from [[PC Quest]],&lt;ref&gt;Anindya Roy, (February 01, 2008) ''[http://pcquest.ciol.com/content/handson/2008/108020101.asp Live Vista]'', [[PC Quest]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[:de:PC-Welt|PC-Welt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Christian LÃ¶bering, (10 Dec 2009) ''[http://www.pcwelt.de/start/software_os/windows/praxis/196912/der_usb_stick_als_notfallsystem/index.html Der USB-Stick als Notfallsystem]'' ''(The USB flash drive as a backup system)'', [[PC-Welt]], also [http://digitalewelt.freenet.de/softwareos/windows/der-usbstick-als-notfallsystem-_531024_275572.html appeared] in freenet&lt;/ref&gt; (the German edition of [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]], which also offers some customized scripts for building disk images including additional utilities, branded as pcwVistaPE&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcwelt-praxis.de/dokumentation/anleitungen/pcwvistape-vista-als-zweitsystem pcwVistaPE]&lt;/ref&gt; and pcwWin7PE&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcwelt-praxis.de/dokumentation/anleitungen/pcwwin7pe-schritt-fuer-schritt-zum-winpe-rettungssystem pcwWin7PE]&lt;/ref&gt;), the Russian edition of [[CHIP (magazine)|CHIP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} ÐÐ°ÐºÑÐ¸Ð¼ ÐÐ¼ÐµÐ»Ð¸Ð½ (August 2007) ''[http://chip-online.ru/archive/docs/upload/036049_01.pdf Windows PE: Vista, ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐ°Ñ Ð²ÑÐµÐ³Ð´Ð° Ñ ÑÐ¾Ð±Ð¾Ð¹]'' ''(Vista, which is always with you)'', [[CHIP (magazine)|CHIP]], pp. 38&amp;ndash;42&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[TeraByte Unlimited]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/howto/win7pe_tutorial.htm Creating a Win7RescuePE Boot Disc Containing Image for Windows] and [http://www.terabyteunlimited.com/howto/vistape_tutorial.htm Creating a VistaPE Boot Disc Containing Image for Windows], [[TeraByte Unlimited]] How-To Guides&lt;!-- these are pretty good tutorials, generally useful if you omit including their proprietary [[Image for Windows]] software in the disk image. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNET]] editor's review found that &quot;WinBuilder is one of the most easy-to-use boot disk creation tools in the genre,&quot; and praised it for its &quot;novice-friendly interface&quot;, but at the same time warned that the &quot;program expects experienced users. For the most part, boot disk applications are for experts only.&quot; The built-in Download Center was remarked because it &quot;simplifies  procuring the boot disk applications.&quot; Other features praised were &quot;its small size, fair memory overhead, simple instructions, and robust application installation wizards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CNET Staff, (December 25, 2007) ''[http://download.cnet.com/WinBuilder/3000-2094_4-10788498.html WinBuilder 074 CNET editors' review]'', [[CNET]]&lt;/ref&gt;
