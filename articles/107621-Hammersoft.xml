'''Diamond Bar''' is a city in eastern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 55,544 at the 2010 census, down from 56,287 at the 2000 census.  It is named after the &quot;diamond over a bar&quot; branding iron registered in 1918 by ranch owner Frederick E. Lewis.

Located at the junction of the [[Pomona Freeway|Pomona]] and [[Orange Freeway|Orange]] freeways, Diamond Bar is primarily residential with shopping centers interspersed throughout the city.  The city features a public Los Angeles County golf course.

Diamond Bar has the first [[hydrogen station|hydrogen fueling station]] to be built in Southern California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt; near the [[South Coast Air Quality Management District]] (AQMD) building.

==History==
In 1840, Jose de la Luz Linares received the {{convert|4340|acre|adj=on}} [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] [[Rancho Los Nogales]] (Ranch of the Walnut Trees) from Governor [[Juan Alvarado]].  The land grant included Brea Canyon and the eastern [[Walnut Valley]]. Linares died in 1847, and his widow sold a part of the ranch to [[Ricardo Vejar]] for $100 in merchandise, 100 calves, and the assumption of her late husband's debts.  Vejar also owned the [[Rancho San Jose (Palomares)|Rancho San Jose]] to the east, and acquired the rest of Rancho Nogales over the next 10 years.

But Vejar's luck did not last that long. As time wore on - and particularly as the United States government took over California - Rancho Los Nogales was divided and sold into multiple land ranches, the largest of which was the Diamond Bar Ranch. At the time, it was one of the largest working cattle ranches in the western U.S.  The entire Diamond Bar Ranch was acquired by the [[Transamerica Corporation]] in the 1950s for the purpose of developing one of the nation's first master-planned communities. Transamerica gave the Diamond Bar name to its new community and incorporated the ranch's familiar diamond and bar cattle brand into various logos (many of which are still in use today).

The first houses in this development were built in 1960, adjacent to the future location of the [[California State Route 60|Pomona Freeway]], which was built through the area ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaroads.com/california/ca-060.html&lt;/ref&gt; The town's development and population grew extremely quickly after that.

Transamerica oversaw all development of the community through the 1960s.  The Transamerica Corporation divested itself of all its real estate ventures in the 1970s and 1980s.  As a result, the Diamond Bar project was sold to multiple developers and much of its initial master plan was not implemented during the latter half of its development in the 1980s.

Pantera Park was originally the site of legendary Spinal Tap lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel's miniature horse farm.

The City of Diamond Bar was incorporated on April 18, 1989.

==Geography==
Diamond Bar is located at {{Coord|34|0|6|N|117|49|15|W|type:city}} (34.001652, -117.820761).{{GR|1}}  The city's main road, Diamond Bar Boulevard, runs along the bottom of the valley that eventually becomes [[Brea Canyon]], and housing developments overlook the boulevard on both sides from surrounding hills. The city lies roughly between the ends of the [[Chino Fault]] and the [[Whittier Fault]], both part of the larger [[Elsinore Fault Zone]].

Positioned in the southeastern corner of the [[San Gabriel Valley]] in eastern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], Diamond Bar is approximately 27 miles east of [[Downtown Los Angeles|downtown]] [[Los Angeles]]. Neighboring communities include [[Walnut, California|Walnut]], [[Rowland Heights, California|Rowland Heights]], and [[Pomona, California|Pomona]].

Similar to many [[San Gabriel Valley]] cities such as [[San Marino, California|San Marino]] and [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]], Diamond Bar has experienced an influx of [[Asian American]] residentsâespecially [[Filipino American]]s, [[Taiwanese American]], [[Chinese American]]s, [[Vietnamese American]]s, [[Korean American]]s, and [[Indian American]]s -- since the 1980s. Attracted to the area's schools and the perceived prestige of a Diamond Bar address, many affluent Asian Americans commuting to areas such as [[Rowland Heights, California|Rowland Heights]] and [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] have moved to Diamond Bar as well. In addition, some Asian-oriented businesses have since appeared in the city.
