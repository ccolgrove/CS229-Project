The Eagles entered their second home game of the season at 1â1 and facing an 0â2 Kansas City Chiefs team. Kevin Kolb once again started in place of the injured Donovan McNabb and starting running back Brian Westbrook, starting left guard [[Todd Herremans]] (who had been out the first two weeks as well), and number two wide receiver [[Kevin Curtis]] all missed the game as well. Nevertheless, the Eagles struck first as rookie RB [[LeSean McCoy]], starting in place of Westbrook, scored on a five yard touchdown scamper. Later in the first quarter, Kevin Kolb scored his first ever NFL rushing TD on a quarterback sneak to put Philadelphia up 14â0 at the end of the first quarter.

In the second quarter, [[Matt Cassel]] scored the Chiefs' first touchdown of the game on a nice pass to a leaping [[Mark Bradley]] over the head of CB [[Ellis Hobbs]] to cut the Eagles' lead to seven. However, Philadelphia bounced back as Kevin Kolb hooked up with DeSean Jackson for a 64 yard score. The Eagles tacked on an Akers field goal to go up 24â7 at the half.

The Philadelphia defense which had been great all day continued to do their jobs in the third quarter and the Kansas City began to step up their game as the only score of the third period was a 38 yard field goal kick by David Akers, putting the Eagles up 27â7.

In the fourth quarter, Kevin Kolb tossed another touchdown pass, this time to starting third-year TE [[Brent Celek]]. It was Philly's last score of the game and put them up 34â7. Matt Cassel began to rally the Chiefs and drove them down the field, scoring a touchdown on a nine yard pass to [[Bobby Wade]], making the score 34â14. However, the Chiefs were unable to get on the board again and 34â14 was the final score.  Kolb is the first quarterback to throw at least 300 yards in his first 2 career starts.

With the win, the Eagles went into their bye week at 2â1.

The Eagles ended the second half with another McNabb-to-Maclin TD hookup, this one of 40 yards.

In the third quarter, the two teams fought back and forth but the only score was for Philadelphia as running back [[Brian Westbrook]], one play after lining up wide and catching a twenty-yard pass from McNabb, ran the ball seven yards into the end zone to put the Eagles up 28â7.

Kicker [[David Akers]] booted a 44-yard field goal in the fourth quarter to put Philly up 31â7, but the Bucs fought back as Josh Johnson and Kellen Winslow hooked up again on another nine yard touchdown. After a [[Sav Rocca]] punt left the Buccaneers deep in their own territory, DE [[Darren Howard]] tackled Tampa Bay halfback [[Carnell Williams|Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams]] in the end zone for a safety.

The final score was 33â14 as the Eagles improved to 3â1.  Andy Reid earned his 100th career victory with the Eagles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20091011/SPORTS02/91011005&lt;/ref&gt;  The Eagles are 11â0 after their bye week under Andy Reid.

The final quarter's first points were scored by Oakland as Janikowski hit on a 46-yard field goal. David Akers scored on a 45 yard field goal for the Eagles, but when they got the ball back late in the fourth quarter, they turned it over on downs and the Raiders ran the clock out.

Coming off their win over the Giants, the Eagles stayed at home for a Week 9 Sunday night divisional duel with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] with the lead in the NFC East on the line.

Philadelphia would trail in the first quarter as Cowboys running back [[Tashard Choice]] picked up a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would respond in the second quarter with a 45-yard and a 48-yard field goal from kicker [[David Akers]], but Dallas would answer with kicker [[Nick Folk]] nailing a 22-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, Philadelphia would take the lead as quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] found tight end [[Brent Celek]] on an 11-yard touchdown pass.  However, the Cowboys struck back in the fourth quarter with Folk's 33-yard field goal and quarterback [[Tony Romo]]'s 49-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Miles Austin]].  The Eagles tried to get a comeback, but could only muster up a 52-yard field goal from Akers.

With the loss, the Eagles fell to 5â3.

Hoping to rebound from their tough Sunday night loss to the Cowboys, the Eagles flew to [[Qualcomm Stadium]] for a Week 10 interconference duel with the [[San Diego Chargers]].  Philadelphia would trail in the first quarter as Chargers quarterback [[Philip Rivers]] completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to fullback [[Mike Tolbert]].  San Diego would add onto their lead in the second quarter with running back [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]'s 3-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles would get on the board with kicker [[David Akers]] getting an 18-yard and a 25-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Chargers went back to work as Tomlinson got a 20-yard touchdown run.  Philadelphia would try to stay close as Akers nailed a 25-yard field goal, but San Diego kept their attack going as Rivers hooked up with wide receiver [[Legedu Naanee]] on a 20-yard touchdown pass.  The Eagles' offense would finally get going in the fourth quarter as quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver [[Jeremy Maclin]] and a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Brent Celek]].  However, the Chargers would prove to be too much to handle as kicker [[Nate Kaeding]] booted a 29-yard field goal.

With the loss, the Eagles fell to 5â4.

Following two consecutive losses to Dallas and San Diego, Philadelphia went to Chicago to take on the Chicago Bears, who were 4â5, on ''Sunday Night Football''. The Eagles dominated the first quarter as Philadelphia took a two score lead on a 25-yard field goal by [[David Akers]] and a 13-yard touchdown from [[Donovan McNabb]] to [[Jason Avant]] on a wide receiver screen pass.

Down 10â0 at the start of the second quarter, Chicago drove within one point as Bears kicker [[Robbie Gould]] successfully made a 45-yard field goal, as well as a pair of 28-yard field goals, to make the score 10â9 at the half.

In the second half, the Bears took the lead as Robbie Gould kicked his fourth field goal, a 49-yarder that put Chicago up 12â10. However, it took only 30 seconds for the Eagles to take the lead as Donovan McNabb passed to [[DeSean Jackson]] for a 48-yard touchdown to give the Eagles a 17â12 lead. Ironically, the 48-yard touchdown catch was the shortest touchdown scored by Jackson thus far in the season. Chicago again took the lead in the third quarter as struggling quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]], who had already missed several wide open targets in the game, passed to tight end [[Kellen Davis]] for a 15-yard score. The Bears converted the 2-point conversion attempt as running back [[Matt Forte]] scored on the pass from Cutler to put the Bears back on top 20â17.

In the fourth quarter, both defenses fought back and forth but the only points of the final period were scored by Eagles running back [[LeSean McCoy]] on a 10-yard, game-winning touchdown run to put the Eagles up 24â20, the game's final score.

With the win, the Eagles improved to 6â4. Ironically, the Eagles win came by the same score (24â20) in the same city (Chicago) at the same time and venue (''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football on NBC]]'') as when they had lost in week 4 of the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]].

In the second meeting of the year with the [[Washington Redskins]], the Eagles tried an onside kick to start the game. This backfired when the Redskins running back [[Quinton Ganther]] recovered the kick and returned it 25 yards to the Eagles 24-yard line. Four plays later, Redskins quarterback [[Jason Campbell]] ran for a two-yard touchdown to score the game's first touchdown, as the Redskins took the lead 7â0. After a holding penalty on Eagles tight end [[Brent Celek]], the Eagles had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker [[David Akers]]. On the following drive by the Eagles, quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] found wide receiver [[DeSean Jackson]] wide open in the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown to bring the Eagles up 10â7. On the ensuing drive by the Redskins, Campbell threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to [[Santana Moss]] to take the lead 14â10.

Late in the second quarter, after both teams punting the ball away after three unsuccessful drives, Eagles cornerback [[Asante Samuel]] intercepted a Jason Campbell pass that was intended for Santana Moss. The Eagles could not convert a third down with 10 to go, and David Akers kicked a 24-yard field goal to get the Eagles within a point of the Redskins, 14â13. The Redskins received the ball again and Campbell threw a second straight interception to Samuel, who returned it for 17 yards. The Eagles ended the first half with a second straight field goal to take the lead 16â14.

The Eagles got the ball to start the second half, but the drive ended with a [[Sav Rocca]] punt. Jason Campbell threw a 10-yard touchdown to tight end [[Fred Davis (tight end)|Fred Davis]] to take the lead once again, 21â16.

After two straight punts for each team, the Eagles got the ball back in the fourth quarter and Donovan McNabb threw an intended pass to [[Reggie Brown (wide receiver)|Reggie Brown]], but the pass was intercepted by Redskins cornerback [[Justin Tryon]]. The Redskins scored on a 25-yard field goal by [[Shaun Suisham]], to increase their lead 24â16. The Eagles started their drive on their own 10-yard line after a penalty on the kick return by [[Dimitri Patterson]]. The Eagles went 90 yards to score on an [[Eldra Buckley]] one-yard touchdown run. Since they were losing by two points, the Eagles decided to go for a two-point conversion. The two-point conversion was successful after rookie running back [[LeSean McCoy]] ran in the end zone on a shovel pass from McNabb. The score was tied, 24â24. The Redskins could not score on the next drive, and therefore had to punt to the Eagles. The Eagles scored on a 32-yard field goal by David Akers to take the lead, 27â24. The Eagles got the ball back on downs, and kneeled the ball to run out the clock and win 27â24.

With the win, the Eagles improved to 7â4.

Following back to back wins against Chicago and Washington, the Eagles traveled to Atlanta to take on the [[Atlanta Falcons]] who were 6â5. While the Falcons were without quarterback [[Matt Ryan]] and running back [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] due to injury, as well as a pair of offensive linemen, the Eagles came into the game without explosive wideout [[DeSean Jackson]], linebacker [[Akeem Jordan]], or nickel corner [[Joselio Hanson]], who had been suspended by the league for violating its substance abuse policy.

In the first quarter, Eagles kicker [[David Akers]] scored on a 33-yard field goal and fullback [[Leonard Weaver]], who would go on to make an outstanding one-handed, 59-yard catch-and-run, and finish the game with 100 total yards, caught an under thrown ball by [[Donovan McNabb]] in the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown that put the Eagles up 10â0.

Atlanta's backup quarterback [[Chris Redman]] struggled all game and backup running backs [[Jerious Norwood]] and [[Jason Snelling]] seemed, in most cases, unable to find holes, and both offenses struggled in the second quarter, the only score coming on another 33-yard field goal by David Akers.

The Eagles dominated the third quarter as quarterback [[Michael Vick]], in his return to Atlanta, ran in a five-yard score to put the Eagles up 20â0, his first touchdown of the year. It kept getting worse for Atlanta as Chris Redman, who had had pass after pass batted at the line during the game, was intercepted by cornerback [[Sheldon Brown (American football)|Sheldon Brown]], who returned the interception 83 yards for a score.

Philly went up 34â0 in the fourth quarter as Michael Vick, coming in as a relief player for Donovan McNabb, tossed a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Brent Celek]]. The Eagles defense seemed to be en route to their first shutout since [[1996 NFL season|1996]], but the Falcons scored with one second left on the clock on a 3-yard touchdown pass from Redman to wide receiver [[Roddy White]].

The Eagles third consecutive win left them 8â4, heading into a pivotal Sunday Night matchup against their division rival [[New York Giants]].

The winner of this Sunday Night showdown would assume first place in the NFC East (the Eagles outright, the Giants on tiebreakers). With two games against opponents with losing records approaching, it was crucial for the Giants to escape this one with a win.

The Eagles started things off right away, putting 14 points on the board before the Giants had run their fifth play from scrimmage. McNabb connected with Celek for a touchdown, and Sheldon Brown returned a Brandon Jacobs fumble for six points on the ensuing drive. In the second quarter, Nicks caught the longest reception of his short career for a 68-yard touchdown. After DeSean Jackson responded by returning a Jeff Feagles punt 72 yards for a touchdown, the Giants were able to send Bradshaw into the end zone from the 3. Eagles backup quarterback Michael Vick was able to sneak in one more rushing touchdown before halftime. Jacobs opened the scoring in the second half with a 1-yard rush. After the teams traded turnovers, Manning got the ball into Hixon's hands for a 61-yard touchdown. But the Eagles responded on the very next play with a 60-yard touchdown to Jackson. Jackson's 176 receiving yards amounted to the best individual receiving performance against the Giants since 2002. The Eagles struck again in the fourth quarter, this time on a run by fullback Leonard Weaver and a two-point conversion pass to Jason Avant. The Giants put another touchdown on the board (courtesy of Boss) in the last two minutes of the game, and got the ball back with 28 seconds left. But defensive end Darren Howard sacked Manning and forced a fumble, sealing the Eagles' first sweep of the Giants since 2004.

The Eagles scored 85 points against the Giants this year, the most they have scored versus the Giants in a single season in franchise history. The Eagles have improved to 9â4 with many hopes of making it into the playoffs.

Entering the postseason as the NFC's #6 seed, the Eagles began their playoff at [[Cowboys Stadium]] for the third meeting against their hated rival, the #3 [[Dallas Cowboys]], in a rematch of their Week 17 defeat.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Cowboys would strike first in the second quarter with quarterback [[Tony Romo]]'s 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[John Phillips (American football)|John Phillips]]. Philadelphia would answer with quarterback [[Michael Vick]] hooking up with rookie wide receiver [[Jeremy Maclin]] on a 76-yard touchdown, but Dallas would start to pull away as running back [[Tashard Choice]] got a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Cowboys would pile on their lead with kicker [[Shaun Suisham]]'s 25-yard field goal, Romo's 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Miles Austin]], and Suisham's 48-yard field goal.

Dallas would add onto their lead in the third quarter as running back [[Felix Jones]] scored on a 73-yard touchdown run.  The Eagles tried to mount a comeback drive in the fourth quarter as quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] found wide receiver [[DeSean Jackson]], but the Cowboys would prevent any further attempts.

With the loss, Philadelphia was eliminated, ending its season with an overall record of 11â6.

This would be Donovan McNabb's last game as an Eagle.
