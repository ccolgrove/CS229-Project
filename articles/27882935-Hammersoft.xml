The '''New Mexico School of Natural Therapeutics''' is a [[natural therapy]] and [[massage]] school located in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. The school is often referred to by its initials, NMSNT.

==History==

Founded in 1974 by David Tinkle as the New Mexico School of Therapeutic Massage. In 1976 Tinkle retired leaving Robert Stevens and Charles Brown with ownership of the school. In 1978, the name was changed to the New Mexico School of Natural Therapeutics, and the curriculum was broadened beyond therapeutic massage, using the philosophy of [[Henry Lindlahr]], M.D. as the foundation&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot;&gt;Lindlahr, H: ''The Philosophy of Natural Therapeutics''  http://books.google.com/books?id=CCDrK08LnpgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Philosophy%20of%20Natural%20Therapeutics&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;.

Robert Stevens is the Director of New Mexico School of Natural Therapeutics. 
Don Cornwell, who arrived at the school in 1979, is the Director of Education.

Non-profit status was granted in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertStevens&quot;&gt;Robert Stevens, online correspondence, May 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's Natural Remedy Store was started in 1976 under the name Herbal Apothecary.  The name was later changed to the Herb Store, which is still in existence but no longer affiliated with the school. 

The main building on campus was purchased of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santa Fe]] in 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertStevens&quot; /&gt;. The Natural Remedy Store and Student Clinic annex was purchased several years later with a donation from a graduate's father.&lt;ref name=&quot;RobertStevens&quot; /&gt;

==Philosophy==

The school's core philosophy is based upon the work of [[Henry Lindlahr]] &lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot; /&gt;. Considered the father of  modern, western Natural Therapeutics &lt;ref&gt;George Jean Nathan, Henry Louis Mencken (1950). ''American Mercury Magazine'', 70(543).&lt;/ref&gt;, he developed and directed a school and sanitarium that taught and tested the use of natural practices to aid the healing of disease and injury. Lindlahrâs school became the model for modern naturopathic medical colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, H:  ''Toward an integrative medicine: merging alternative therapies with biomedicine'', page 36. Rowman Altamira, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindlahr describes how nature heals and he viewed the acute process as the bodyâs attempt to heal itself of accumulated waste products. Accordingly, the more successful someone is at suppressing symptoms during the acute process, the weaker the bodyâs capacity to heal itself.

==Curriculum==

The healing modalities taught at the New Mexico School of Natural Therapeuticsâand the lifestyle it encouragesâhave been designed to promote health by supporting natural healing processes, rather than by fighting the symptoms of disease. 

The school teaches multiple aspects of natural therapeutics and massage, which have been used by indigenous cultures throughout the world&lt;ref&gt;Salvo, S: ''Massage Therapy Principles and Practice'', pages 4-9.  Saunders, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;.  Specifically, the New Mexico School of Natural Therapeutics focuses on clinical practice, principally centered upon two systems of bodywork: [[Massage|Therapeutic Massage]] and [[Polarity therapy|Polarity Therapy]]. Also included are [[Anatomy]] &amp; [[Physiology]], [[Chinese Medicine]] and [[Acupressure]], [[Shiatsu]], [[Reflexology]], [[Herbalism|Herbal Medicine]], [[Bach flower remedies|Flower Remedies]] (Bach, Stevens), [[Joint mobilization|Joint Mobilization Techniques]] and others.

Introductory courses offered by the school that are atypical of most massage therapy schools include Homeopathic First Aid, Core Synchronism, [[Craniosacral therapy|Cranial-Sacral Therapy]], Principles of [[Colonics|Colon Therapy]], Living Foods [[Nutrition]], [[Essential Oils]] and [[Radionics]].
