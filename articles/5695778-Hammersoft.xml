==Replacement==
From September 2005, a pre-launch promo saying, &quot;[[The Incredibles]]! Coming soon!&quot; aired on all three channels. Soon, another promo aired, this time revealing the name &quot;[[Disney Cinemagic (UK &amp; Ireland)|Disney Cinemagic]]&quot;. The promo had [[Mickey Mouse]] wearing his attire from &quot;The Scorcerer's Apprentice&quot;. He walked onto a blank white screen, got hold of a magic wand, touched the tip with his finger and transformed it into a [[television]] remote. He pressed a button on the remote and [[hologram]]s of Disney characters come out. On 16 March 2006, Toon Disney UK was showing back-to-back episodes of [[Kim Possible]] before it eventually closed down. It then aired a [[testcard]] saying, &quot;Disney Cinemagic. Coming soon!&quot;. This lasted four hours, until 10:00, when it was replaced by Disney Cinemagic.
