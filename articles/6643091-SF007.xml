The '''Debian Almquist shell''' ('''dash''') is a [[Unix shell]], much smaller than [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] but still aiming at [[POSIX]]-compliancy. It requires less disk space but is also less [[feature-rich]].

== History ==

Dash is a direct descendant of the [[NetBSD]] version of the [[Almquist shell]] (ash). It was ported to [[Linux]] by [[Herbert Xu]] in early 1997. It was renamed to ''dash'' in 2002.

Dash, like ash, executes [[shell script]]s faster than [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] and depends on fewer libraries. It is believed&lt;ref&gt;http://packages.debian.org/dash&lt;/ref&gt; to be more reliable in the case of upgrade problems or disk failures. dash may be used as a:

* shell on installation [[floppy disk]]s
* root user shell
* /bin/sh replacement
* testing environment for shell scripts to verify their compatibility with POSIX syntax

Dash is a modern replacement for ash in [[Debian]] and was expected to be the default /bin/sh for Debian Lenny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://release.debian.org/lenny/goals.txt Release goals for Debian Lenny]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/04/msg00002.html Release Update: architecture status, release goal status, BSPs]&lt;/ref&gt; Dash has been the default /bin/sh in [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] since the 6.10 release in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh Dash as /bin/sh in Ubuntu 6.10]&lt;/ref&gt; During the transition by Ubuntu, numerous scripts making use of [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]]-specific functionality (but not declaring it) were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dash/+bug/61463 Ubuntu bug #61463: script that are using bash could be broken with the new symlink]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dash/+bug/141481 Ubuntu bug #141481: dash as #!/bin/sh introduces countless incompatibilities]&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid errors, Bash-specific scripts can be modified to be compatible with the appropriate standard, or explicitly declare their use of [[Bash (Unix shell)|bashisms]] by explicitly setting the interpreter to bash via the [[Shebang (Unix)|shebang]] line: &lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env bash&lt;/code&gt;.
