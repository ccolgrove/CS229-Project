'''Wells State Park,''' is a state park located in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]. The park, managed by the [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]], features a [[campground]], swimming beach, trails, and picnic areas. Wells State Park is located off [[Massachusetts Route 49]]. The property includes frontage on [[Walker Pond]], the  scenic [[metamorphic rock]] cliff face of Carpenter Rocks, and groves of [[eastern white pine]]. Terrain is rugged with ledges interspersed between wetlands. Woodlands are of the [[oak-hickory forest]] and [[northern hardwood forest]] types. 

==History==
Wells State Park was opened on July 19, 1968. Carpenters rock was named after John Carpenter, who built and operated a nearby saw mill.
