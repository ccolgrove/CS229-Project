'''White Birds Productions''' was a [[France|French]] [[video game developer]]. White Birds was founded by [[BenoÃ®t Sokal]], Olivier Fontenay, Jean-Philippe Messian and Michel Bams in August 2003. White Birds specialise in [[Adventure game]]s but also handle other work, such as synthetic image creation, comics and merchandising.

The four founders had previously worked together at another French video game company, [[MicroÃ¯ds]], producing ''[[Amerzone]]'' and ''[[Syberia|Syberia I]]'' &amp; ''[[Syberia II|II]]''. MicroÃ¯ds has since maintained connections with the company, for example by publishing ''[[Sinking Island]]''.

White Birds Productions was based in the Paris suburb of Joinville-le-Pont (94) and employed 20 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitebirdstouch.com/?page_id=4 |title=About |publisher=White Birds |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Birds was a member of the PlayAll project, a middleware cross-platform created in collaboration with other game studios and university laboratories.

The company was shut down late 2010 due to financial problems mostly caused by a cancelled/unpaid for project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2011/1/9/news/79207/ |title=White Birds shut down |date=2011-01-09 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Games ==
White Birds primarily develop PC games, but they are also work with other consoles such as the [[Nintendo DS]] and the [[iPhone]]/[[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,757/ |title=Taking flight with White Birds, Part One |publisher=Adventure Gamers |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
