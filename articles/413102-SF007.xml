'''Folding@home''' is a [[distributed computing]] project designed to use spare processing power on personal computers to perform simulations of disease-relevant [[protein folding]] and other [[molecular dynamics]], and to improve on the methods of doing so. Also referred to as '''FAH''' or '''F@h''', much of its work attempts to determine how proteins reach their [[Protein tertiary structure|final structure]], which is of significant academic interest and has implications to both [[Medical research|disease research]] and [[nanotechnology]]. To a lesser degree Folding@home also tries to [[Protein structure prediction|predict]] that final structure from only the initial [[amino acid]] sequence, which has applications in [[drug design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2 questions&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=14179#p139017 | title = Re: FAH really doing anything? | author = Imran &quot;ihaque&quot; Haque (Pande lab member) | date = 2010-08-11 | accessdate = 2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of [[Vijay Pande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stanford.edu/group/pandegroup/folding/FoldingFAQ.pdf | title = Folding@Home Executive summary | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the project is to &quot;understand protein folding, misfolding, and related diseases&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.stanford.edu | title = Folding@home - Main | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | year = 2011 | accessdate = 2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions, and participate in virtually every process within cells. They often act as [[enzymes]], performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], transportation, [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]], and others.

Current theory holds that toxic non-[[senile plaques|plaque]] AÃ [[oligomers]] (aggregates of many [[monomers]]) bind to a [[cell surface receptor|surface receptor]] on [[neuron]]s and change the structure of the [[synapse]], thereby disrupting neuronal communication and causing neuronal [[cell death]] which leads to the associated [[neurodegenerative]] consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lacor PN,''et al.'' | title = AÃ Oligomer-Induced Aberrations in Synapse Composition, Shape, and Density Provide a Molecular Basis for Loss of Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 796â807 | year = 2007 | month = January | pmid = 17251419 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3501-06.2007 | last2 = Buniel | first2 = MC | last3 = Furlow | first3 = PW | last4 = Clemente | first4 = AS | last5 = Velasco | first5 = PT | last6 = Wood | first6 = M | last7 = Viola | first7 = KL | last8 = Klein | first8 = WL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rationally designed turn&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = P.

Despite this connection, toxic AÃ aggregations remain so complex that it was not previously possible to simulate them in atomic resolution. In 2011, the Pande lab explored how their Abeta studies using Folding@home could be used as a starting point for a new Alzheimer's therapy. Folding@home is currently concentrating on Alzheimer's and continues full-scale simulations of amyloid beta and its oligomerization,&lt;ref name=&quot;Alzheimers work&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/fahproject.overusingIPswillbebanned?p=6802 | title = Project 6802 Description | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had previously been a technological challenge to simulate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Simulating oligomerization&quot;/&gt; These studies build off of the Pande lab's 2008 published work into new ways to simulate Abeta [[oligomerization]] over long timescales. In the same publication, previous all-atom simulations were performed that led to specific experimentally-tested predictions, such as ways in which to stabilize the protein and prevent the toxic oligomer formation. The Pande lab is focusing their research in this area for rational [[drug design]] approaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt; Pande described that paper as the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; for the Folding@home studies of Alzheimer's, as further results will follow and possibly new therapeutics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alzheimers work&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simulating oligomerization&quot;/&gt;

Folding@home is also being used to study AÃ fragments of different sizes to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of AÃ. These fragments are tied to senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease in patient's brain. When certain enzymes cleave the [[amyloid precursor protein]], Abeta peptides are produced, while the action of other enzymes can instead produce p3 peptides, much smaller fragments of AÃ. Folding@home is simulating one of these smaller peptides in water in an effort to determine how the length of AÃ affects its overall structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/fahproject.overusingIPswillbebanned?p=6871 | title = Project 6871 Description | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, several possible drug leads predicted by Folding@home went from the [[test tube]] to testing on living [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], and in close cooperation with the Nanomedicine Center for Protein Folding, the drug leads continued to be refined. Additionally, as predicted by FAH's simulations, a stable form of amyloid beta was experimentally verified which the Pande lab believes could be used as a starting point for new Alzheimer's therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alzheimers work&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Simulating oligomerization&quot;/&gt; In 2008, Folding@home produced several small drug candidates to fight Alzheimer's Disease, as they appear to inhibit the toxicity of Abeta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2008/12/new-fah-results-on-possible-new-alzheimers-drug-presented.html | title = New FAH results on possible new Alzheimer's drug presented | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2008-12-18 | accessdate = 2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Pande lab is also using Folding@home to investigate [[proteinâprotein interaction]]s, which occur extensively throughout both benign and disease-related biological activities. Interactions involving the common [[SH3 domain|SH3]] protein are also being studied, as it has implications in Alzheimers research. The refinement of these simulations has greatly improved the Pande lab's ability to understand a wide variety of biological interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/fahproject.overusingIPswillbebanned?p=700 | title = Project 700 Description | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huntington's disease===
[[Huntington's disease]], an incurable [[neurodegenerative]] genetic disorder affecting [[Motor coordination|muscle coordination]] and leading to [[dementia]], is also associated with protein misfolding. Specifically, it is caused by a mutation in the [[Huntingtin gene]], which causes excessively long [[polyglutamine tract|repetitive chains]] of the [[glutamine]] amino acid in the [[Huntingtin protein]], a protein that plays important roles in [[nerve cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walker FO | title = Huntington's disease | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9557 | page = 220 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17240289 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60111-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntingtin headpiece structure&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nicholas W.

The Pande lab is using Folding@home to study these aggregates, as well as predict how they form.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt; How this aggregation occurs has been largely unknown, but in 2009 a paper based off of Folding@home's results and published in the [[Journal of Molecular Biology]] investigated possible mechanisms for the aggregation formation, and the implications into how to prevent it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huntingtin headpiece structure&quot;/&gt; These studies will be useful for [[drug design]] approaches against the disease, and will serve as a foundation for methods to stop the aggregation formation. Additionally, some of the methods used to study Huntington's are also being used for Alzheimer's research.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt;

In 2010, Folding@home researcher Veena Thomas proposed a novel therapeutic strategy for HD, which may be funded by the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]. This strategy could be used to bring the results from Folding@home directly to a therapeutic.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt;

===Cancer===
More than half of all known [[cancer]]s involve mutations in [[p53]], a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which signals for cell death in the event of damage to a cell's [[DNA]]. If p53 becomes mutated, breaks down, or fails to fold properly, it will no longer be able to cause the &quot;stop signal&quot; for cell division. Cells will consequently divide and grow uncontrollably to form tumors.&lt;ref name=&quot;novel alanine scanning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = L.T. Chong, W. C. Swope, J. W. Pitera, and V. S. Pande | title = A novel approach for computational alanine scanning: application to the p53 oligomerization domain | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | year = 2006 | volume = 357 | issue = 3 | pages = 1039â1049 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2005.12.083 | pmid = 16457841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folding@home is used to study specific properties of p53 in order to understand and predict these mutations, and in 2007 work began to develop inhibitor proteins that deactivate damaged p53.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt; The Pande lab has also developed a novel experimentally-verified method for predicting how mutations affect p53, which has had reasonable success in the identification of deleterious mutations such as those linked to cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;novel alanine scanning&quot;/&gt; This supplemented work performed in 2005 that studied how mutations affect the folding of p53, and which mutations are relevant to cancer. While it was the first peer-reviewed publication from a distributed computing project related to cancer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20070706192334/http://forum.folding-community.org/viewtopic.php?t=10950 | title = First results from Folding@Home cancer project published | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2005-01-16 | accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study also agreed well with experiments and offered insights that were previously unobtainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = L.

Pande. | title = Dimerization of the p53 Oligomerization Domain: Identification of a Folding Nucleus by Molecular Dynamics Simulations | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | year = 2004 | volume = 345 | issue = 4 | pages = 869â878 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmb.2004.10.083 | pmid = 15588832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these results, the Pande lab have expanded their work to other p53-related diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt;

The Pande lab is also performing research into [[Chaperone (protein) | protein chaperones]]. These are proteins that assist in the folding of other molecules, assembly of oligomeric structures, the prevention of potential damage caused by protein misfolding, and other functions. They are needed for these purposes by rapidly growing cancerous cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nanomedicine center&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2007/09/nanomedicine-ce.html | title = Nanomedicine center | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2007-09-28 | accessdate = 2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Folding@home and working closely with the Protein Folding Center, they plan to find ways to inhibit chaperones involved in cancer. Using Folding@home for a more comprehensive visualization of their functions, the Pande lab and the Protein Folding Center collectively plan to engineer modified chaperonins to inhibit the folding of particular proteins associated with human diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. While this approach has been used before, they believe that this project, if successful, could lead to an interesting new drug against cancer or at least make major advances in that area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nanomedicine center&quot;/&gt;

Folding@home is also used to study the folding of several other proteins which have mutations tied to cancer, such as the enzyme [[src Kinase]] and certain forms of the [[Engrailed (gene) | Engrailed]] [[Homeodomain]]. These proteins also have a great deal of experimental data for comparison, and serve as a great system for the understanding of folding and misfolding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2009/12/release-of-new-protomol-core-b4-wus-.html | title = Release of new Protomol (Core B4) WUs | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2009-12-22 | accessdate = 2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/fahproject.overusingIPswillbebanned?p=180 | title = Project 180 Description | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Pande lab is using Folding@home to understand the dynamics of a small [[Trefoil knot fold | knottin]] protein and how it can be used to bind to [[contrast agent]]s for [[Medical imaging | imaging scan]] or [[drug]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/fahproject.overusingIPswillbebanned?p=7600 | title = Project 7600 Description | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some forms of [[interleukin-2]], an important signaling protein for the immune system, have been used as [[immunotherapy]] for cancer.

===Parkinson's disease===
[[Parkinson's disease]] is a [[Neurodegeneration|degenerative]] disorder of the [[central nervous system]], characterized by shaking, rigidity, [[Bradykinesia|slowness of movement]], and [[dementia]]. The Pande lab has performed preliminary studies on the properties of [[alpha-synuclein]], a key [[intrinsically unstructured proteins|natively unfolded protein]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt; Particular mutations of alpha-synuclein can aggregate to form toxic fibrils, and while the mechanism of this aggregation remains largely unknown, it can lead to the Parkinson's disease and other conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arima K, UÃ©da K, Sunohara N, Hirai S, Izumiyama Y, Tonozuka-Uehara H, Kawai M | title = Immunoelectron-microscopic demonstration of NACP/alpha-synuclein-epitopes on the filamentous component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and in dementia with Lewy bodies | journal = Brain Res. | volume = 808 | issue = 1 | pages = 93â100 | year = 1998 | month = October | pmid = 9795161 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-8993(98)00734-3  | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pande lab is also testing how Folding@home's methods apply to this problem, and in 2005, Pande presented results from FAH at a [[National Parkinson Foundation]] conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt;

===Osteogenesis imperfecta===
[[Osteogenesis imperfecta]] is a non-curable genetic bone disorder. Those with the disease are unable to successfully make functional connective bone tissue. This is lethal for many but can also induce a higher rate of [[miscarriages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt; The disease is caused by mutations in the Type-1 [[collagen]] protein, the most common form of collagen and found abundantly throughout the body. Although some of these mutations of collagen can lead to serious morphological disorders, more benign forms can cause brittle bones and other subtleties.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt; Folding@home has performed simulations of collagen, and has produced a paper on Osteogenesis imperfecta outlining new molecular simulation techniques and revealing new insights into how collagen misfolds. The Pande lab believes these results will be useful for later computational studies of collagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sanghyun Park, Randall J. Radmer, Teri E. Klein, and Vijay S.

===Viruses===
Folding@home is also performing simulations of certain [[virus]]es such as [[influenza]] and [[HIV]]. These viruses are widespread, have a history of causing global [[pandemic]]s, and are exceptionally difficult to treat. While the majority of treatments focus on preventing [[viral replication]], Folding@home's research concentrates on preventing the virus from entering [[cellular membrane]]s in the first place.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt; [[Membrane fusion]] is a primary action that occurs during this [[viral entry]], and an understanding of this process has implications for [[antiviral drug]]s and national health. Unfortunately, membrane mechanisms are difficult to analyse experimentally. Molecular dynamics simulations run on Folding@home can simulate the [[protein-lipid interaction]]s involved during cellular viral infection, which have improved the Pande lab's understanding of the molecular dynamics behind this process.&lt;ref name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stanford.edu/~kasson/Membrane_Fusion.html | title = Membrane Fusion | author = Peter Kasson | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research using Folding@home also continues on the dynamics of the enzyme [[RNase H]], a key component of HIV, in the hopes of designing drugs to deactivate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=66&amp;t=19423&amp;p=193871#p193871 | title = Project 10125 | author = Gregory Bowman (Pande Group Member) | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug design===
[[Drug design]] has two components; [[protein docking]] and [[free energy calculation]]. These are difficult and time-consuming to determine experimentally and traditional computational approaches must usually trade speed for accuracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3597738.stm | title = Home computers aid disease fight | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2004-09-18 | accessdate = 2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, free energy calculation of molecular processes is a challenge in [[computational chemistry]], but is [[pharmaceutic]]ally useful.&lt;ref name=&quot;POP comp&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guha Jayachandran, M.

As part of the drug design efforts, Folding@home also simulates the [[ribosome]], a large biological machine that synthesizes proteins from [[mRNA]]. It is targeted by approximately half of all known [[antibiotics]], which usually kill bacteria by preventing their ribosomes from making new and essential proteins. The full structure of the ribosome has only been recently determined, but the functions of many [[ribosomal protein]]s remain largely unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/fahproject.overusingIPswillbebanned?p=5765 | title = Project 5765 Description | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | accessdate = 2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Pande lab received a [[grant]] to study and design new antibiotics.

==Software==
Folding@home software on the user's end consists of three components: a client, work units, and cores.

===Client===
Folding@home is powered by volunteers who have installed a [[client (computing)|client]] [[computer program|program]] on their [[personal computer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Press FAQ&quot;/&gt; The project differs from other distributed computing projects, such as those under BOINC, by offering a variety of clients such as those for [[multi-core processor]]s, [[graphics processing unit]]s, and [[PlayStation 3]]s, complementing the standard client designed for [[uniprocessor]] systems. While the former clients use significantly more system resources, they also have the capability of completing an overall simulation very quickly, (in a few weeks or months rather than years) which is of major scientific value.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-SMP | title = Folding@home SMP FAQ | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | format = FAQ | date = 2010-12-11 | accessdate = 2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folding@home is the first project to fully utilize GPUs, PS3s, or multi-core processors for distributed computing.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPU news&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2008/05/gpu-news-gpu1-g.html | title = GPU news (about GPU1, GPU2, &amp; NVIDIA support) | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2008-05-23 | accessdate = 2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Travis Desell1, Anthony Waters, Malik Magdon-Ismail, Boleslaw K.

====Graphics processing units====
[[GPU]]s are computer chips used to accelerate 3D graphics, which are most commonly found in video games. GPUs have the capability to significantly out-perform [[CPU]]s in terms of Floating Point OPerations, ([[FLOP]]s) at the cost of lower generality.&lt;ref name=&quot;highper FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2007/09/how-fah-works-f.html | title = How FAH works: Folding on streaming processors (GPU's and PS3) | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2007-09-24 | accessdate = 2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, high-performance computing is increasingly utilizing the GPU specialized hardware. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific reliability, the Pande lab found that although GPUs lack built-in memory [[error detection and correction]], reliable scientific computation can be performed on consumer-grade hardware, as long as sufficient measures are taken (such as Folding@home's built-in error detection) to ensure data integrity.&lt;ref name=&quot;hard data on soft errors&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = I.

Despite their potential benefits, scientific computing on GPUs has previously remained inefficient and difficult. The Pande lab has been able to write [[OpenMM]], an [[open source]] molecular dynamics [[Library (computing) | library]] optimized to take full advantage of the GPU architecture and gain large speed increases over conventional single-CPU implementations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Acc.

====PlayStation 3====

Folding@home can also take advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s, to achieve performance previously only possible on supercomputers. Unlike Microsoft's [[Xbox]], the PS3 is well suited for Folding@home simulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3 FAQ&quot;/&gt; At the time of its inception and for certain calculations, its main [[stream processing|streaming processor]] [[Cell processor]] delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Press FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biotech 27&quot;/&gt; allowing the Pande lab to address problems previously considered impossible to tackle computationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3 FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn ps3&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2006/TECH/fun.games/09/18/playstation.folding/ | title = PlayStation's serious side: Fighting disease | author = David E.

The PS3 client was originally a standalone application, but since September 18, 2008 is a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]], developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3 FAQ&quot;/&gt; It takes the middle path between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed, performing a limited set of calculations rapidly while still retaining adaptable.&lt;ref name=&quot;highper FAQ&quot;/&gt; However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, donors cannot perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn ps3&quot;/&gt; Instead, the Pande lab has specifically designed its Work Units to take approximately eight hours so that they can be completed overnight.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS3 FAQ&quot;/&gt; The PS3's uniform console environment makes [[technical support|support]] easier, as well as making Folding@home [[user friendly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Press FAQ&quot;/&gt; The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, allowing for real-time atomic detail visualizations of the protein dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;highper FAQ&quot;/&gt;

====Multi-core processing client====
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:FAH-SMP.jpg|thumb|150px|Folding@home SMP Client set to use 95% of a [[Multi-core (computing)|quad core]] processor.|{{ifdc|1=FAH-SMP.jpg|log=2009 July 15}}]] --&gt;

The [[symmetric multiprocessing|Symmetric MultiProcessing]] (SMP) client fulfills two purposes: it takes advantage of the high-performance capabilities of recent [[multi-core (computing)|multiprocessor]] systems, and it helps develop a simulation architecture that will become one of the dominant FAH computing paradigms as multi-core chips become an industry standard over the next several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biotech 27&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;highper FAQ&quot;/&gt; The SMP client is capable of delivering over a 4x calculation speedup over the standard uniprocessor clients.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;/&gt;

Folding@home's SMP core handles multi-core CPUs very different from other distributed computing projects, including those under [[BOINC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boincfaq.mundayweb.com/index.php?language=1&amp;view=115&amp;sessionID=f68532da1ffd360def2213188757c695 | title = Can I have multiple CPUs work on the same task (workunit)? | author = Ozzfan | publisher = BOINC | date = 2007-10-01 | accessdate = 2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of simply doing multiple Work Units simultaneously, single WUs are completed much faster across the multiple CPU cores.&lt;ref name=&quot;what SMP does&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2008/06/what-does-the-smp-core-do.html | title = What does the SMP core do? | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2008-06-15 | accessdate = 2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cuts down on the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many processors. As such, this approach is very scientifically valuable. Some of the Pande lab publications would not have been possible without the SMP client.&lt;ref name=&quot;what SMP does&quot;/&gt;

On November 13, 2006, first generation SMP Folding@home clients for [[x86]] [[Microsoft Windows]], [[x86-64]] [[Linux]], and x86 [[Mac OS X]] were released.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;/&gt; These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) protocols on the [[localhost]],&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;/&gt; as at the time the Gromacs cores were not designed to be used with multiple [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]s. This made Folding@home the first to use MPI for distributed computing software, as it had previously been reserved only for supercomputers.&lt;ref name=&quot;new windows client&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2008/03/new-windows-cli.html | title = New Windows client/core development (SMP and classic clients) | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2008-03-08 | accessdate = 2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPI-based clients worked well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as [[Linux]] and Mac's [[OS-X]], but was particularly troublesome in Windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;what SMP does&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;new windows client&quot;/&gt; Despite these difficulties, SMP1 generated significant results that would have been impossible otherwise and which represented a landmark in the simulation of protein folding.&lt;ref name=&quot;what SMP does&quot;/&gt;

The second generation of the SMP client was released as an open beta on January 24, 2010, and subsequently replaced SMP1.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP2 release&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=24&amp;t=13038#p127406 | title = upcoming release of SMP2 cores | author = Peter Kasson (Pande lab member) | date = 2010-01-24 | accessdate = 2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMP2 client exchanges the complex MPI for [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]s, which removes much of the overhead of keeping the cores synchronized.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP2 release&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2009/06/how-does-fah-code-development-and-sysadmin-get-done.html | title = How does FAH code development and sysadmin get done? | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2009-06-17 | accessdate = 2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMP2 client also supports a bonus points system, which non-linearly rewards additional points to donors for quick WU returns and for contributing to next-generation capabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;/&gt; Donors who run the SMP2 client receive these extra points if they use a passkey and maintained an 80% successful return of Work Units.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP2 release&quot;/&gt; 

SMP2 also supports extra-large Work Units for users with powerful eight-core CPUs or better. While these WUs consume even more [[RAM]] and have more network usage than regular SMP WUs, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2011/07/change-in-the-points-system-for-bigadv-work-units.html | title = Change in the points system for bigadv work units | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2011-07-02 | accessdate = 2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bigadv&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?t=10697 | title = new release: extra-large work units | author = Peter Kasson (Pande lab member) | date = 2009-07-15 | accessdate = 2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These powerful computers allow for simulations to be performed on Folding@home that had previously required the use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]]. There is a great scientific need to run these simulations out to long timescales as quickly as possible, so the additional bonus points also serves as an incentive for rapid completions of Work Units. This allows the Pande lab to perform studies of larger molecular systems that would not have been possible anywhere else on Folding@home.&lt;ref name=&quot;bigadv&quot;/&gt;

V7 consists of several elements. The user interacts with v7's [[GUI]], known as FAHControl. It has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from a single computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;v7 announcement&quot;/&gt; FAHControl can monitor and direct FAHClient, which runs behind the scenes and in turn manages each FAHSlot (or &quot;slot&quot;). These slots act as replacements for the previously distinct FAH clients, as they may be of Uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU type. Each slot also contains a core and data associated with it, and can download, process, and upload Work Units independently.&lt;ref name=&quot;v7 announcement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;V7 Install Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.stanford.edu/English/WinGuide | title = Windows (FAH V7) Install Guide | author = Pande lab | publisher = [[Stanford University]] | date = 2011-09-23 | accessdate = 2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3 viewer, displays a real-time 3D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.&lt;ref name=&quot;v7 announcement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;V7 Install Guide&quot;/&gt;

===Work Units===
The Work Unit (WU) is the protein data that the client is being asked to process. Each WU is identified for its respective protein Project, Run (conformation), Clone (atomic trajectory), and Generation (time steps in the trajectory/simulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fahwiki.net/index.php/Runs,_Clones_and_Gens | title = Runs, Clones, and Generations | author = Dan Ensign | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The client connects to Folding@home [[Server (computing)|server]]s to retrieve a Work Unit, processes it, and returns it upon completion.&lt;ref name=&quot;F@h works: MSMs&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2007/09/how-fah-works-m.html | title = How FAH works: Markov State Models | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2007-09-22 | accessdate = 2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During transfer, all Work Units are validated through the use of 2048-bit [[digital signature]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main FAQ&quot;/&gt; These WUs have associated deadlines and credit (point) value. If this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be reissued to someone else.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main FAQ&quot;/&gt; As protein folding is serial in nature and each WU is generated from its predecessor, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a WU is not returned after a certain period of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main FAQ&quot;/&gt; Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirements for Folding@home is a Pentium 3 450&amp;nbsp;MHz CPU with [[SSE]] or newer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Main FAQ&quot;/&gt; However, Work Units for high performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;/&gt;

Before public release, Work Units go through several [[Quality Assurance]] steps to keep problematic WUs from becoming fully available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://folding.typepad.com/news/2011/04/more-transparency-in-testing.html | title = More transparency in testing | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2011-04-05 | accessdate = 2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; But unlike particular [[BOINC]] projects such as [[SETI@home]], Folding@home's Work Units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing of a WU. If this occurs for three different donors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=59&amp;t=19315#p192836 | title = Re: Gromacs Cannot Continue Further | author = Bruce Borden (bruce) | date = 2011-08-07 | accessdate = 2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is automatically pulled from distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=19325&amp;p=192927&amp;hilit=8am#p192927 | title = Re: Project: 6053 (Run 1, Clone 194, Gen 357) | author = Bruce Borden (bruce) | date = 2011-08-09 | accessdate = 2011-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=19725#p196444 | title = Re: Project 6803: (Run 4, Clone 66, Gen 255) | author = PantherX | date = 2011-10-01 | accessdate = 2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics in the Folding@home forum can be used to differentiate between problematic hardware and an actual bad Work Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=16526 | title = Troubleshooting Bad WUs | author = PantherX  | date = 2010-10-31 | accessdate = 2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work Units are very much tied to the Pande lab's simulation [[Hidden Markov model | Markov state models]], which allow for extensive [[Parallel computing | parallelization]] of very long simulation processes which otherwise seem intrinsically serial.&lt;ref name=&quot;F@h works: MSMs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/fahproject.overusingIPswillbebanned?p=10513 | title = Folding@home project descriptions - Project 10513 | author = Pande lab | accessdate = 2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the folding process, proteins spend much of their time &quot;waiting&quot; in various states, before quickly transitioning to the next configuration. This allows for the unique possibility to simulate only a small fraction of the overall folding timescale, leading to significant speedups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atomistic subms protein folding&quot;/&gt; The Pande lab achieves this by first dividing the protein's possible dynamics into a series of related conformation states, and creates WUs to calculate the rates of transition between these states.

Folding@home also compares well to [[Anton (computer) | Anton]], a powerful supercomputer which uses specialized hardware to produce a small number of ultra-long molecular trajectories. It is unique in this ability, and like Folding@home, has also improved particular long-held theories of protein folding.

==Notes==
&lt;cite id=&quot;Note 1&quot;&gt;[[#Note 1 back | Note 1:]]&lt;/cite&gt; It should be noted that accurate measurement of the speed of a supercomputer does not necessarily equate to scientific productivity. Supercomputers are typically tested for brief periods using the legacy [[LINPACK]] benchmark. This brief CPU testing is not an accurate indication of their prolonged performance over real-world tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Not using F@h, bruce&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1164&amp;start=165#p138646 | title = Re: Answers to: Reasons for not using F@H | author = Bruce Borden (bruce) | date = 2010-04-07 | accessdate = 2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?p=67416#p67416 | title = Re: ATI and NVIDIA stats vs. PPD numbers | author = Vijay Pande | date = 2008-11-09 | accessdate = 2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
