'''''Le Soir''''' (meaning ''The Evening'') is a [[Berliner (format)|Berliner Format]] [[Belgium|Belgian]] newspaper. ''Le Soir'' was founded in 1887 by [[Emile Rossel]]. It is the most popular [[Francophone]] newspaper in Belgium, and considered a [[newspaper of record]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Editorial stance==
Compared to its centre-right Catholic competitor, ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'', ''Le Soir'' is seen as liberal and progressist with politically [[Belgian federal government|federalist]] leanings.

== Google controversy ==

The paper gained some notoriety on the internet after it successfully sued [[Google]] for [[copyright]] infringement. The case was built on the fact that Google made parts of the newspaper's website available through its search engine and through its [[Google News]] service, even after the articles in question had been removed from the newspaper's website. A Belgian [[judge]] ruled that this did not conform to Belgian regulations and ordered Google to remove all &quot;copyright violations&quot; from its websites. Google responded as requested, by removing all links to the Belgian newspaper not only from its googlenews service but also from its search index.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/07/15/ap/tech/main20079990.shtml Belgian newspaper: Google blocking us on searches], [[Associated Press]], July 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
