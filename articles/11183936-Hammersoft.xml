The station is under ownership of [[Cumulus Media]] and can be heard online at http://player.cumulusstreaming.com/Play.html?KMND-AM.

As an affiliate of the Dallas Cowboys, KMND has signed to carry the Wade Phillips show and the Dallas Cowboys daily report, but they do not have the contract to air the games. Sister station [[KNFM|KGEE/KNFM]] airs the Cowboys games in the Odessa-Midland area. As an affiliate of ESPN Radio, the station carries commercials for the ''ESPN Radio College Football Game of the Week'', the ''BCS on ESPN Radio'', the ''NIT on ESPN Radio'', and ''[[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio]]'', but the station only aired college bowl games that were sold as part of ESPN Radio coverage nationwide. In 2009 they ended up adding the full broadcast schedule beginning with the [[NBA on ESPN Radio]] and then continuing into [[Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio]]. They also carry live coverage of the  [[Midland High School (Midland, Texas)|Midland High Bulldogs]] and the  [[Robert E. Lee High School (Midland, Texas)|Midland Lee Rebels]] post-season play for all sports except football. The station doesn't produce any local shows, but in the past the did produce ''Sportstalk with Robbie Burns'' which aired weekdays from 3 PM- 6 PM and Saturday from 10 AM- 12 PM. They also aired coverage of post-season sports for the [[Midland College|Midland College Chaparalls]] from 2004-2008. In 2009 those rights moved to [[KQRX]].

Before becoming an ESPN Radio affiliate, KMND specialized in talk radio shows now found on [[KCRS (AM)]], including Rush Limbaugh, and tejano music.
