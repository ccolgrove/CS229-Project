'''CrossOver''', known before version 6.0 as '''CrossOver Office''', is the collective name for four commercial and [[proprietary software|proprietary]] programs developed by [[CodeWeavers]] that allow many [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based [[application software|applications]] to run on [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]] using a [[compatibility layer]]. The programs include '''CrossOver Mac''', '''CrossOver Linux''', '''CrossOver Games Mac''', and '''CrossOver Games Linux'''.

The programs are modified, proprietary versions of the public [[Wine (software)|Wine]] source tree with various compatibility [[Patch (computing)|patches]] added, more [[user-friendly]] [[computer configuration|configuration]] tools, and commercial support. CodeWeavers employs several Wine developers and contributes code back to the [[free software]]/[[open-source software]] [[Wine (software)|Wine]] project as per the [[GNU]] [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]], although CrossOver is [[proprietary software]].

== Versions ==
=== CrossOver Mac ===
In June 2005, CodeWeavers announced a new [[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[Mac OS X]] version of CrossOver Office called ''CrossOver Mac'' that will support [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-to-Mac application porting on [[Intel]]-based Macs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.codeweavers.com/about/general/press/?id=20050622 |title=CodeWeavers Expands Developer Services, Enabling Future Windows Application Porting To Mac OS |publisher=CodeWeavers |location=SAINT PAUL, MN |date=June 22, 2005 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crossover Mac was released on January 10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/10/1924235 |title=CodeWeavers Releases CrossOver 6 for Mac and Linux |publisher=Slashdot |date=January 10, 2007 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the release of Crossover Mac 7 on June 17, 2008, Crossover Mac was divided into Standard and Pro versions like Crossover Linux. The standard version includes six months of support and upgrades, while the Pro version includes one year of support and upgrades and a free copy of Crossover Games.

=== CrossOver Linux ===
The program aims to integrate properly with [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] so that applications will run seamlessly in the Linux environment.

CrossOver Linux is offered in two versions&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Standard and Professional. CrossOver Linux Professional provides enhanced deployment and management features for corporate users. The Standard version allows a single user of a single machine. The Professional version allows multiple users.

=== CrossOver Server ===
CrossOver Server allows Windows applications to run in a distributed thin-client environment under Linux and Solaris. CrossOver Server was discontinued in 2007 as many of its features now appear in CrossOver Linux Professional.

=== CrossOver Games ===
CrossOver Games, announced on 10 March 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeremy |last=White |url=http://www.codeweavers.com/about/people/blogs/jwhite/2008/3/10/roadmap-for-2008 |title= Roadmap for 2008 |work=Blogs |publisher=CodeWeavers |date=2008-03-10 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a new product that lets the users play a broad range of games, &quot;particularly games with a lot of replayability such as [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]]s like [[World of Warcraft]] and the range of games from [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] ''e.g.'', [[Team Fortress 2]], [[Counter-Strike: Source]], and so on&quot;. However, there are still a lot of popular games that remain unsupported. The difference with regular CrossOver is that CrossOver Games will have a shorter release cycle in order to update faster to the latest work on [[Wine (software)|Wine]] than with regular CrossOver, which targets stability and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?s=e98e39d63e486e98d2ef3b7ec78f0820&amp;p=4530091&amp;postcount=28 |title=&quot;CrossOver Games&quot; is coming!!! - Repost |accessdate=2009-01-03}}{{Verify credibility|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
