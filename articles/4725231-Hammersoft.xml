The '''Weyburn Red Wings''' are a [[junior ice hockey]] team, based in [[Weyburn]], [[Saskatchewan]], and currently playing in the [[Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League]]. They play their home games at the [[Weyburn Colosseum]] which has a seating capacity of 1,950.   The team colours are red and white.  The team logo is the same as the NHL's [[Detroit Red Wings]]. Radio station [[CFSL]] AM 1190 broadcasts Red Wings games.

The team was created in 1961 and was named after the NHL's [[Detroit Red Wings]].  The team was one of the founding members of the [[Western Hockey League]] in 1966, but left in 1968 to return to the SJHL. Increasing travel costs of playing in the Western Hockey League was the main reason for moving back to the SJHL.  

The team is the most successful in the league in terms of league championships won.  They have won 9 SJHL championships in their history.  They won it in 1970, 1971, 1984, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2001, and 2002.

The team won the [[Royal Bank Cup]], representative of national [[Canadian Junior A Hockey League]] supremacy, in 2005. They won the Cup on home ice, defeating the [[Camrose Kodiaks]] 3â2 in front of 2,152 fans in the championship game.  They also won the trophy in 1984, defeating the Orillia Travelways 3â0 in the seventh game in front of 2,375 fans at the Weyburn Colosseum.
