&quot;'''The Greatest Romance Ever Sold'''&quot; is a song and single from [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s (his stage name at that time being an unpronounceable symbol) 1999 album ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/Prince-The-Greatest-Romance-Ever-Sold/release/1482461&lt;/ref&gt;  The track is a smooth [[ballad]], featuring Prince's multi-layered vocals in the chorus.

The [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] was a remix of the track known as the &quot;'''Adam and Eve'''&quot; remix, featuring a rap by [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]].  This mix was later mixed into the album version and available on the remixed version of the album called ''[[Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic]]''. Prince's verse from the song was later interpolated into the song &quot;Silicon&quot; on the 2004 album ''[[The Slaughterhouse]].'' The [[maxi single]] included additional remixes, produced by [[The Neptunes]] (featuring a guest appearance by [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]]) and [[Jason Nevins]].

Intended to be a comeback single for Prince, the song only became a minor hit, peaking at #63 (#23 on the R&amp;B charts). This could possibly be because the song's music video may not have been released for best effect, instead premiering shortly after ''Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic'' was released and over a month after single was for sale.  The failure of this single to make waves contributed to the relatively poor performance of the album.
