The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Arizona Cardinals]] season''' was the 89th season for the team in the [[National Football League]] and their 21st season in [[Arizona]]. The season marked the Cardinals' first-ever [[Super Bowl]] appearance, coming as a result of their victory against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in the [[NFC Championship]].

The Cardinals began their season strong, compiling a 7â3 record by Week 11. However, they finished off the regular season struggling with a 9â7 record. This was still enough to win the [[NFC West]], and the Cardinals, for the first time since 1947, hosted a playoff game. In that [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] game, the Cardinals defeated the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. The next week, for the Divisional round of the playoffs, the Cardinals traveled to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], where they upset the heavily-favored [[Carolina Panthers]]. Then, because the Philadelphia Eagles also achieved an upset the same week (against the top-seeded [[New York Giants]]), the number-four seed Cardinals hosted the NFC Championship game, where they defeated the Eagles and qualified for the Super Bowl. In [[Super Bowl XLIII]], the Cardinals' winning streak ended. Though they led the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] with less than a minute left to play in the game, in the end they were defeated, 27â23.

The 2008 Cardinals were just the second 9â7 team to reach the Super Bowl, joining the [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] in [[Super Bowl XIV]], who also lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]; however, the Rams had to win only two playoff games, rather than three, to reach the Super Bowl.

Coming off their east-coast divisional road win over the Panthers, the Cardinals went home for the [[NFC Championship Game]] against the #6 [[Philadelphia Eagles]], who were coming off their victory over the #1 [[New York Giants]], in a rematch of their Thanksgiving game.

Arizona capped off the game's opening kickoff with a nine-yard touchdown pass from quarterback [[Kurt Warner]] to wide receiver [[Larry Fitzgerald]]. The Eagles responded with kicker [[David Akers]] making a 45-yard field goal. With the score at 7â3, Akers missed a 47-yard field goal attempt, the first he missed in his last 20 attempts in the postseason, an NFL Record. The Cardinals answered in the second quarter as Warner hooked up with Fitzgerald again on a flea-flicker, Warner to Arrington, back to Warner, who threw it to Fitzgerald for a 62-yard TD pass. Philadelphia struck back as Akers made a 33-yard field goal, but Arizona closed out the half with Warner's one-yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald and kicker [[Neil Rackers]]' 49-yard field goal in the final seconds of the half to make the score 24â6.

The Eagles began to rally in the third quarter as quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] completed a six-yard and a 31-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Brent Celek]] with a failed PAT on the latter touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia took the lead on 62-yard touchdown pass from McNabb to rookie wide receiver [[DeSean Jackson]]. The Eagles went for the two-point conversion, hoping for a three point lead, but failed, leaving the score 25â24. However, the Cardinals regained the lead when Warner completed an eight-yard touchdown pass to rookie running back [[Tim Hightower]] and a successful two-point conversion pass by Warner to tight end [[Ben Patrick]]. The Arizona defense was able to prevent Philadelphia from making a comeback, as the Eagles drove to the Arizona 47, but then McNabb threw four straight incompletions to turn the ball over on downs. The Cardinals went three and out on the next possession, giving the Eagles only seven seconds in the game, but the Eagles were unable to score on a 93-yard hook and ladder play after McNabb completed to Jackson, who attempted to lateral, but the lateral was picked off by defensive lineman [[Darnell Dockett]].

The Cardinals improved their overall record to 12â7, and also won their first National Football Conference crown, allowing them to advance to their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. They became the first team since the 1979 [[St. Louis Rams|Los Angeles Rams]] to finish the regular season with 9 wins and make it to the Super Bowl.

Fitzgerald had a stellar performance with 152 yards and three of Arizona's four touchdowns and setting a new postseason record with 419 receiving yards, surpassing the prior record set by [[Jerry Rice]] in 1988.
