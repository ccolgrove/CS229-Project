'''Father Christmas''' is the name used in many [[English language|English]]-speaking countries for a figure associated with [[Christmas]]. A similar figure with the same name (in other languages) exists in several other countries, including [[France]] (''[[PÃ¨re NoÃ«l]]''), [[Spain]] (''PapÃ¡ Noel'', ''Pare Noel''), almost all [[Hispanic America|Hispanic]] [[South America]] (''PapÃ¡ Noel''),  [[Brazil]] (''Papai Noel''), [[Portugal]] (''Pai Natal''), [[Italy]] (''Babbo Natale''), [[Armenia]] (''Kaghand Papik''), [[India]] (''Christmas Father''), [[Romania]] (''MoÅ CrÄciun'') and [[Turkey]] (''Noel Baba'') .

In past centuries, the English Father Christmas was also known as Old Father Christmas, Sir Christmas, and Lord Christmas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Father Christmas is said to wear (these days) a bright red suit, but in Victorian and Tudor times he wore a bright green suit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Father Christmas typified the spirit of good cheer at Christmas, but was neither a gift bringer nor particularly associated with children.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  A traditional figure in English [[folklore]], Father Christmas is identified with the old belief in the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Old English god]] [[Woden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happychristmas.org.uk/santa/father-christmas.htm |title=All about Father Christmas |publisher= HappyChristmas.org.uk |date= |accessdate= 2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.christmasarchives.com/england.html |title=Customs from England |publisher=The Christmas Archives |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.familiesonline.co.uk/article/static/252/{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=McKnight | first=George Harley | title=St. Nicholas - His Legend and His Role in the Christmas Celebration |year=1917 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=S4MtGxqMEpEC&amp;dq | publisher= [[G.

In the English-speaking world, the character called &quot;Father Christmas&quot; influenced the development in the [[United States]] of [[Santa Claus]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and in the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere, most people now consider them to be interchangeable.  However, although &quot;Father Christmas&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus&quot; have for most practical purposes been merged, historically the characters have different origins and are not identical.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some authors such as [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} have insisted on the traditional form of Father Christmas in preference to [[Santa Claus]].

Father Christmas/Santa Claus is often said to reside in [[North Pole, Alaska]] or less commonly, in the mountains of [[Korvatunturi]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], [[Finland]], or sometimes at the [[North Pole]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== History ==
The earliest English examples of the personification of Christmas are apparently those in [[carols]] of the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The manuscript Bodelian Library MS Arch. Selden b. 26, which dates from circa 1458 AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens, John 1970&quot;&gt;Stevens, John. 'Musica Britannica: Medieval Carols'. Stainer and Bell LTD, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; contains an anonymous Christmas carol (f. 8) which begins with the lyrics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goday, goday, my lord Sire ChristÃ«mas, goday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goday, Sire ChristÃ«mas, our king,&lt;br&gt;
for ev'ry man, both old and ying,&lt;br&gt;
is glad and blithe of your coming;&lt;br&gt;
Goday!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, a carol attributed to Richard Smert (c. 1400âc. 1479&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoasm.org/IVM/Smert.html |title=Richard Smert |publisher=HOASM |date= |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in British Additional MS 5665 (ff. 8v-9v),&lt;ref name=&quot;Stevens, John 1970&quot;/&gt; begins in dialog form:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell
:Who is there that singeth so: Nowell, nowell, nowell?
I am here, Sire ChristÃ«smas.
:Welcome, my lord, Sire ChristÃ«mas!
:Welcome to us all, both more and less!
:Come near, Nowell.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both songs then proceed to proclaim the birth of Christ in the present tense and elaborate upon the story of the nativity as occasion for rejoicing.

The specific depiction of Christmas as a merry old man begins in the early 17th century, in the context of resistance to [[Puritan]] criticism of observation of the Christmas feast.{{fact|date=September 2011}} He is &quot;old&quot; because of the antiquity of the feast itself, which its defenders saw as a good old Christian custom that should be kept. [[Allegory]] was popular at the time, and so &quot;old Christmas&quot; was given a voice to protest his exclusion, along with the form of a rambunctious, jolly old man. The earliest such was that in [[Ben Jonson]]'s creation in ''Christmas his Masque''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Poetry/christmas_his_masque.htm Christmas, His Masque - Ben Jonson&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; dating from December 1616, in which Christmas appears &quot;attir'd in round Hose, long Stockings, a close Doublet, a high crownd Hat with a Broach, a long thin beard, a Truncheon, little Ruffes, white shoes, his Scarffes, and Garters tyed crosse&quot;, and announces &quot;Why Gentlemen, doe you know what you doe? ha! would you ha'kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas?&quot; Later, in a masque by Thomas Nabbes, ''The Springs Glorie'' produced in 1638, &quot;Christmas&quot; appears as &quot;an old reverend gentleman in furred gown and cap&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The character continued to appear over the next 250 years, appearing as Sir Christmas, Lord Christmas, or Father Christmas, the last becoming the most common.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  A book dating from the time of the Commonwealth, ''The Vindication of CHRISTMAS or, His Twelve Yeares' Observations upon the Times'' (London, 1652),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mercuriuspoliticus.wordpress.com/2008/12/21/a-christmassy-post/ |title=A Christmassy post &amp;#124; Mercurius Politicus |publisher=Mercuriuspoliticus.wordpress.com |date=2008-12-21 |accessdate= 2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; involved &quot;Old Christmas&quot; advocating a merry, alcoholic Christmas and casting aspersions on the charitable motives of the ruling [[Puritans]].

Father Christmas dates back at least as far as the 17th century in Britain,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and pictures of him survive from that era, portraying him as a well-nourished bearded man dressed in a long green fur-lined robe. A writer in &quot;Time's Telescope&quot; (1822) states that in [[Yorkshire]] at eight o'clock on Christmas Eve the bells greet &quot;Old Father Christmas&quot; with a merry peal, the children parade the streets with drums, trumpets, bells, (or in their absence, with the poker and shovel, taken from their humble cottage fire), the yule candle is lighted, and; &quot;High on the cheerful fire. Is blazing seen th' enormous Christmas brand.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, William Francis (2007). [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/22042/22042-h/22042-h.htm#Page_202 The Project Gutenberg eBook, Christmas: Its Origin and Associations] ''[[Project Gutenburg]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since the [[Victorian era]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Father Christmas has gradually merged with the pre-modern gift giver [[St Nicholas]] (Dutch [[Sinterklaas]], hence [[Santa Claus]]) and associated folklore. Nowadays he is often called Santa Claus but also often referred to in Britain as Father Christmas: the two names are synonyms. In Europe, Father Christmas/Santa Claus is often said to reside in the mountains of [[Korvatunturi]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland Province]], [[Finland]].

Traditionally,{{When|date=April 2011}} Father Christmas comes down the chimney to put presents under the [[Christmas tree]] or in children's rooms, in their stockings. Some families leave a glass of sherry or [[mulled wine]], mince pies, biscuits, or chocolate and a carrot for [[Santa Claus's reindeer|his reindeer]] near the stocking(s) as a present for him. In modern homes without chimneys he uses alternative 21st century electronic devices to enter the home. In some homes children write Christmas lists (of wished-for presents) and send them up the chimney or post them.

==Appearance==
[[File:Santa Claus-SL.jpg|right|225px|thumb|&quot;Father Christmas&quot; is often synonymous with [[Santa Claus]].]]
Father Christmas often appears as a large man, often around 70 years old. He is dressed in a red or green [[snowsuit]] trimmed with white fur, often girdled with a wide black belt (in the case of Santa Claus variations), a matching hat, often long and floppy in nature (also in the case of Santa Claus variations), and dark hobnail-style [[jackboots]]. Often he carries a large brown sack filled with toys on his back (rarely, images of him have a beard but with no moustache). Urban myth &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/york/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8394000/8394067.stm |title=BBC - Father Christmas, green or red? |publisher=BBC News |date=4 December 2009 |accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; has it that the red suit only appeared after the Coca Cola company started an advertising campaign depicting a red suited Father Christmas in the 1930s. However, the company themselves admit that the red suit had appeared before they used the image themselves. In reality, the red-suited Santa was created by [[Thomas Nast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/dec/10/coke-denies-claims-it-bottled-familiar-santa/ Coke denies claims it bottled familiar Santa image], Jim Auchmutey, ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', December 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/article/20091128/COMMUNITIES/91127064/1005/news01/Santa-s-arrival-lights-up-the-Green|title=Santa's arrival lights up the Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=0pnJDKfYi3QC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=thomas+nast+santa+claus&amp;num=50&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20nast%20santa%20claus&amp;f=false|title=''Christmas in America - A History'' By Penne L. Restad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
Father Christmas appears in many [[English language|English-language]] works of [[fiction]], including [[Robin Jones Gunn]]'s ''Father Christmas Series'' (2007), [[Catherine Spencer]]'s ''A Christmas to Remember'' (2007), [[Debbie Macomber]]'s ''There's Something About Christmas'' (2005), [[Richard Paul Evans]]'s ''The Gift'' (2007), [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobeâ]]'' (1950), [[Raymond Briggs]]'s ''[[Father Christmas (comics)|Father Christmas]]'' (1973) and the translation from French of [[Jean de Brunhoff]]'s ''Babar and Father Christmas'' (originally ''Babar et le pÃ¨re NoÃ«l'', 1941). [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]'' are letters he wrote addressed to his children from Father Christmas.

The ''J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia'' compares Tolkien's Father Christmas with [[L. Frank Baum]]'s Santa Claus, as he appears in ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'':
{{quote|Santa Claus's friends raise an army to save him from monsters called Awgwas. Tolkien's [[goblin]]s somewhat resemble the Awgwas, who also steal presents. But Baum's Santa does not fight like Tolkien's Father Christmas does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kapelle | first= Rachel | chapter=Father Christmas Letters | editor=Michael D.C. Drout | title= J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia| publisher= CRC Press| year= 2007 | isbn= 0415969425 | pages= 199â200}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

C.S. Lewis, a children's author and Christian, preferred the traditional Father Christmas because of his clear connection with the [[Christianity|Christian]] holiday of Christmas.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
