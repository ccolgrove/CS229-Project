==The case==
In June 2009, Asia Noreen, a farm hand from the village of Ittan Wali in [[Sheikhupura District]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last =Munir | first =Manzer | title =Aasia Bibi and Impurities in the Land of the Pure | publisher =Digital Journal | date =December 7, 2010 | url =http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/301145 | accessdate =December 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was asked to fetch water; she complied, but some of her Muslim fellow workers refused to drink the water as they considered Christians to be &quot;unclean&quot;.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; Apparently some arguments ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asia Bibi, Pakistan Blasphemy Case Defendant, Death Sentence Handed Down|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/11/asia-bibi-pakistan-blasph_n_782297.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; There had already been a running feud between Noreen and a neighbour about some property damage.&lt;ref name=kazim/&gt;  Later some coworkers complained to a cleric that Noreen made derogatory comments about [[Prophet Muhammad]].  A mob came to her house, beating her and members of her family before she was rescued by the police.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; However, the police initiated an investigation about her remarks, resulting in her arrest and prosecution under [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|Section 295 C of the Pakistan Penal Code]].&lt;ref name=aps/&gt; She spent more than a year in jail. In November 2010 Muhammed Naveed Iqbal, judge at the court of [[Sheikhupura]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]],  sentenced her to death by hanging.&lt;ref name=aps/&gt; Additionally, a fine of an equivalent of $1,100 was imposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/11/christian-woman-sentenced-to-death-for-blasphemy-in-pakistan/ |first1=Reza |last1=Sayah |first2=Nasir |last2=Habib |publisher=[[CNN]] |title=Christian Woman Sentenced to Death for Blashemy in Pakistan |date=November 11, 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noreen's husband, Aashiq Fauji Masih, 51 years old,&lt;ref name=&quot;jang.com.pk&quot;&gt;http://jang.com.pk/jang/nov2010-daily/25-11-2010/col4.htm&lt;/ref&gt; plans to appeal the verdict, which has to be upheld by the [[Lahore High Court]].&lt;ref name=aps/&gt;

As of November 2011, Asia Bibi remains in prison, more than 2 years after the alleged incident and one year after the death sentence.

==International response==
[[Pope Benedict XVI]] called for clemency for Noreen, and the conviction has also been criticized by human rights groups. According to [[Human Rights Watch]] researcher Ali Dyan Hasan, &quot;The law creates this legal infrastructure which is then used in various informal ways to intimidate, coerce, harass and persecute.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Karin Brulliard, &quot;Both sides in blasphemy case pressure Zardari&quot;, ''The Washington Post'', November 26, 2010 http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/25/AR2010112503585.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible presidential pardon==
According to the Governor of Punjab who investigated the affair for the President [[Asif Ali Zardari]], Noreen is likely to be pardoned if the High Court does not suspend the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/11/23/pakistan.christian/?hpt=T2  |work=CNN  |author=Henderson L, Agrawal A  |title=Pakistan's president will pardon Christian woman, official says  |date=November 23, 2010  |accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the local imam threatened that if she is pardoned or released, some people would &quot;take the law into their own hands&quot;.&lt;ref name=price&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11930849 | title = Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi 'has price on her head' | last = Guerin  | first = Orla |date = December 6, 2010 | work = [[BBC]] | accessdate = December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family has received threats and has gone into hiding.&lt;ref name=price/&gt;

== Assassinations for comments on Noreen==
On January 4, 2011, at Kohsar Market of [[Islamabad]], the Governor of Punjab, [[Salmaan Taseer]], was assassinated by a member of his security team, Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri, because of his defence of Noreen and opposition to the blasphemy law. Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of the law and the verdict in the Asia Bibi case.  The next day, thousands turned up for governor Salman Taseer's funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Salman Taseer: Thousands mourn Pakistan governor&quot; ''BBC News'' January 5, 2011 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12116764&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of Muslims also rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Declan Walsh, &quot;Salmaan Taseer, Aasia Bibi and Pakistan's struggle with extremism&quot;, ''The Guardian'', January 8, 2011 http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/08/salmaan-taseer-blasphemy-pakistan-bibi Accessed March 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan's Minority Affairs Minister [[Shahbaz Bhatti]], the only Christian member of Pakistan's cabinet, was also assassinated, on March 2, 2011, reportedly also for his position on blasphemy laws. He was shot dead by gunmen who ambushed his car near his residence in Islamabad.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine Anthony, &quot;Militants say killed Pakistan minister for blasphemy&quot;, ''Reuters'', March 2, 2011 http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/02/us-pakistan-assassination-idUSTRE7211GH20110302 Accessed March 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
On Sept. 9th 2011 VOM reports the 28-year-old son of murdered Punjab governor Salman Taseer was kidnapped Aug. 26. Authorities have no suspects, and no ransom demands had been made by Shahbaz Taseerâs kidnappers.
