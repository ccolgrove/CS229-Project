==The Future of Her Career==

On Sunday February 25, 2007, the [[Deseret Morning News]], a [[Salt Lake City]] newspaper, had reported that Ruth's five-year deal with [[KTVX]] would expire on February 28, 2007. It may become Ruth Todd's final On-Air appearance on Utah Airwaves  [http://www.deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660198619,00.html] and mark her last appearance on the air after 15 years as one of Utah's most visible and popular journalists  [http://www.sltrib.com/search//ci_5320456].  She said station managers told her last year they wanted to offer her a new contract, but that negotiations stopped after parent company [[Clear Channel Communications]] announced plans in November to sell all its television stations  [http://www.sltrib.com/search//ci_5320456].
