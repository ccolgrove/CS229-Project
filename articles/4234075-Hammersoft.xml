==History==
Before becoming a separate entity, WNYF was a repeater for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WWTI]] with the call sign '''W28BC'''. During that time, WWTI and WWNY had secondary affiliations with Fox. WWNY's secondary affiliation was for [[National Football League]] games during the years CBS did not have broadcasting rights of the league. When that network acquired the rights to the [[American Football Conference]], WWTI then aired NFL from Fox, in addition to ABC's ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' (now on fellow [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] network [[ESPN]]). 

In 2001, United Communications Corporation and WWNY entered into an agreement with [[Smith Media, LLC|Smith Broadcasting]] to make W28BC and repeater station '''W25AB''' in Watertown separate full-time Fox affiliates. W28BC changed its call letters to '''WNYF-LP''' when the Watertown station changed its call letters to '''WNYF-CA''' signifying its upgrade to Class A status. WNYF-LP's low-powered analog signal on UHF channel 28 aired from a transmitter on [[New York State Route 420|NY 420]] in Massena. 

An agreement with [[Time Warner]] Cable in Fall 2001 placed the station on channel 2. After a year of joint operation of WNYF by Smith Broadcasting and United Communications, the latter took complete ownership and made it a full sister to WWNY. Until September 18, 2006 when [[UPN]] shut down and merged with [[The WB]] to form [[The CW]], WNYF also ran some programming from the network as a secondary affiliate. 

On August 25, 2008, WNYF-CA received [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) approval to begin its own high definition digital broadcasts as '''WNYF-CD''' on UHF channel 35 after WWNY-DT returned to its former analog position on VHF channel 7 (which happened February 17, 2009). On September 14, WNYF-CD signed-on using WWNY-DT's existing UHF antenna structure. The change represented the first time WNYF was available over-the-air in high definition. &lt;ref name=&quot;0914wnyf&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=WWNY/WNYF DTV Transition |title=WNYF-CA, Watertown Makes the DTV/HDTV Transition |url=http://dtvtransition.blogspot.com/2009/09/wnyf-ca-watertown-making-dtvhdtv.html |date=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On June 30, 2009, United Communications applied to the FCC for a digital version of WNYF-LP on UHF channel 18. This allocation was formerly used for [[WPBS-TV|WNPI-DT]]'s analog signal. It was approved for [[construction permit|construction]] on June 8, 2010. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwnytv.com/about/96043719.html&lt;/ref&gt; Now known as '''WNYF-LD''', it features Fox as well as a simulcast of WWNY on a second digital subchannel. This helps [[St. Lawrence County, New York|St Lawrence County]] viewers who had experienced difficulty receiving WWNY's digital signal after that station transitioned to digital-only broadcasts. 

On December 16, 2010, WNYF began to be seen on Time Warner Cable systems in the [[Burlington, Vermont]]/[[Plattsburgh, New York]] market after the provider dropped that area's affiliate [[WFFF-TV]] because of an ongoing retransmission dispute. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/12/16/47829/denied-locals-twc-importing-distant-signals&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was eventually resolved and the home station was added back to the system.

==Newscasts==
On April 11, 2001, WWNY began airing a 35 minute weeknight prime time broadcast at 10 on WNYF called ''7 News Tonight on Fox''. However, it was only seen by a handful of viewers able to receive that station's two low-powered over-the-air signals because WNYF was not yet being offered on cable. An agreement with Time Warner Cable in Fall 2001 placed the station on the system and the prime time news debuted for the rest of the area on October 4. WNYF simulcasts the 6 o'clock hour of WWNY's weekday morning news and then offers a second hour at 7 seen exclusively on this Fox affiliate while that station airs ''[[The Early Show]]''. The simulcast and separate show is known on WNYF as ''7 News This Morning on Fox''. Although there is no weekday morning or noon meteorologist, news anchor Beth Hall presents the weather forecast. During the weeknight weather segment, the station features a live [[National Weather Service]] [[weather radar]] based in the Parkers section of [[Montague, New York|Montague]].
