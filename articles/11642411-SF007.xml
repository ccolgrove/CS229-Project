<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="11642411" ns="0" title="Yellow Empire"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''Yellow Empire''' is the primary antagonist in ''[[The Secret of the Swordfish]]'' trilogy (the first books in the ''[[Blake and Mortimer]]'' series of graphic novels).  It is a totalitarian superpower ruled by Emperor Basam Damdu; its capital is [[Lhasa]] and while its original territory is never defined, it rules over the entire world before its downfall.

== History/plot ==
The graphic novels do not reveal the origins of the Yellow Empire or how Basam Damdu came to power.  It is simply explained to be an expansionist power with the strongest army and most advanced weapons in the world, including a nuclear arsenal &quot;capable of destroying the world in a few hours&quot;.  At the opening of the novel, the Yellow Empire has been fighting a cold war against the [[free world]] for three years; in the first few pages, it launches a massive surprise attack against its enemies.  Within a few days, the world is overrun, leaving Basam Damdu ruler of a global empire.

Through military occupation, and with the help of [[fifth columnists]] in every country, the Yellow take all necessary measures to bring the world completely under their boot.  They also organize a system of concentration camps in the [[Himalayas]], where foreign scientists, political prisoners and others are imprisoned and forced to work for them.

However, this victory is not entirely complete; pockets of resistance survive all over the world, and remain ready to continue the fight.  At the heart of the resistance movement is a secret [[Royal Navy]] base in the Straits of Hormuz, where the British are working around the clock to produce the Swordfish, a new superweapon that will turn the tide of the war.  The Yellow are aware of the weapon's existence; most of the novels follow their attempts to capture the Swordfish blueprints.  Though they do not succeed, they do learn the location of the British base, and put together a task force to destroy it.  The battle is almost a success, but the British finish their first two prototypes just before the base is overrun, and they turn the tide of battle; the Yellow task force is destroyed.  

When news of this spreads, the resistance cells all over the world are put into action, resulting in a string of Yellow defeats (Paris, Madrid, Rome, New York, Buenos Aires and Shanghai are all mentioned as having been retaken by the rebels).  Enraged, Basam Damdu decides to launch his nuclear arsenal against the world in revenge.  Before he can do so, however, an entire squadron of Swordfish appears above Lhassa and nukes it; the Emperor is killed, and the Yellow Empire ends.

== Government structure ==
The Yellow Empire is a totalitarian regime under the absolute control of Emperor Basam Damdu (in the tradition of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy and [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Russia).  The official ideology is never specified, but it seems to be a form of Asian supremacism, like [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Imperial Japan's propaganda]] during World War II.  A later novel reveals that Basam Damdu was a &quot;great admirer&quot; of [[Nazi]] ideology, and signed a secret accord with Adolf Hitler at some point during his reign; whether the Yellow played any role in [[World War II]] within the Blake and Mortimer universe, however, is unknown.

The hierarchy and structure of the government are not well defined (though it is clear that the Emperor has final say in all matters).  However, two government departments are shown in the comics;
* The High Council, a body of military, scientific, political and other leaders who advise the Emperor in matters of governance.
* The 13th Bureau, the organ in charge of state security.  Like the [[SS]] and [[KGB]], is serves both as an intelligence agency and a secret police.  Despite its important position, it is not actually commanded by a Yellow but by a European, Colonel Olrik, who betrayed his country to Basam Damdu and is the main villain of the comics.  

== Military ==
Judging from the quick and crushing victory in World War III, it can be safely assumed that the Yellow Empire has the most powerful military in the world.  Their doctrine rests on defeating their enemy quickly through the use of surprise and overwhelming force, similar to German [[blitzkrieg]] tactics in World War II.  After the initial victory, their military turns into an army of occupation; this leaves them vulnerable to [[guerrilla warfare]] from local partisans, who have more success against them than conventional armies have had.

The Yellow Army's technology is world-class.  [[Jet engine|Jet propulsion]] and [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weaponry]], in particular, have been extended throughout the entire Yellow military, even though both technologies were very new at the time the books were published.  

The following is a partial list of Yellow weapons used in the comics.

* '''Shark'''; a jet-driven fighter, which can fly as high up as the stratosphere, it is the workhorse of the Yellow Air Force and is well represented in all three episodes.
* '''Red Wing'''; Colonel Olrik's personal aircraft, a jet-driven version of the American [[Flying wing]].  The Yellow appear to have an affinity for the flying wing design, as bomber and carrier variants of the Red Wing also appear intermittently throughout the comics.  (The original aircraft is stolen by Blake, Mortimer and Sergeant Ahmed Nasir during an escape, and later shot down by pro-British guerrillas).
* '''Super bazooka'''; a rocket launcher that fires five hundred rockets per minute; similar to Soviet [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] launchers.  Featured at the Lhassa arsenal during the opening pages of the book, it is later used at the battle of the Straits of Hormuz.
* '''Dragon'''; a flame-throwing tank, weighing a hundred tons and strong enough to flatten a bunker.  Appears in the opening pages of the book, but is never seen in battle.
* '''[[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]]'''; years before this happened in real life, the Yellow Empire has developed an arsenal of nuclear-tipped rockets with global reach, enough to destroy the world if launched.  Basam Damdu nearly fires the rockets at the end of the books, but they are nuked by British Swordfish before they can be launched.
* '''GX3'''; a green-colored chemical gas, deployed by the Yellow at the battle of the Straits of Hormuz, almost bringing them victory.  The filters in [[gas masks]] are useless against it; when Yellow forces go into a combat zone infected with GX3, they carry [[oxygen masks]] instead.

== Attempted return ==

After ''The Secret of the Swordfish'', the Third World War fades into the background and the Yellow are rarely brought up again, until the 2001 story [[The Strange Encounter]], which is set in 1954 and leans much more heavily towards [[science fiction]].

In the new graphic novel, it is revealed that Basam Damdu, many of his advisers and his elite guard were rescued from Lhassa at the last moment by a race of time-travelers from the 81st century.  5,000 years in the future, the Earth has become a barren wasteland as a result of nuclear wars waged in the 21st century; the remnants of mankind, having recently discovered time travel, have decided to colonize the 20th century for their own survival.  They believe Basam Damdu, the only man to have successfully conquered and ruled over the entire world, to be their only viable leader to help them take over the world.

Basam Damdu hatches a plan to steal a dozen hydrogen bombs from the U.S. Army; this being done, he believes he can blackmail the 20th century's leaders into surrendering the world, by threatening to launch the nuclear weapons from the future using time-travel technology.  Blake and Mortimer, as well as the American [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], discover his plan, prevent the theft of the bombs and destroy the technology that allows time travel from the future.  Basam Damdu's plan fails, and with no more time traveling device, he is confined to the 81st century for the rest of his life.

== Behind the scenes ==

Though based in Lhasa, the Yellow Empire bears no resemblance to the Tibet of its time, and does not represent any real life nation.  Rather, it was designed as a generic &quot;enemy&quot; nation, drawing most of its inspiration from traditional [[yellow peril]] imagery, and also from the [[Axis powers]] that had recently been defeated.  The Axis influence is especially shown in its flag (based on the Japanese [[Rising Sun Flag]]), and in its tactics (an updated version of the German [[blitzkrieg]]).

In addition, Basam Damdu's personality seems very much modeled on Hitler's.  His fits of rage as his empire falls around him recall Hitler's well documented [[temper tantrums]], while his tendency to blame his defeats on treason within his officer corps was also a Hitlerian trait.  Finally, his decision to destroy the world upon his defeat is reminiscent of Hitler's orders to have the city of Paris mined and set ablaze should it fall into enemy hands.
