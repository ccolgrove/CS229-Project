'''Microsoft Office 2000''' is a release of [[Microsoft Office]] that succeeded [[Microsoft Office 97]] and was designed as a fully 32-bit and [[Y2K]] compliant version to match [[Windows 2000]] features. All the Office 2000 applications have [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE 2]] capacity, which allows moving data automatically between various programs. [[Microsoft Office XP]] is a successor of Office 2000. The most comprehensive Office 2000 suite is Office 2000 Developer. Office 2000 [[Software release life cycle#RTM|RTM]] is the last Microsoft Office edition which does not include [[Product Activation]], although SR-1 updated editions of Office 2000 had product activation in copies sold in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United States except their volume license editions. They required the user to activate the product via the Internet.

Mainstream support for Office 2000 ended on June 30, 2004&lt;ref name=&quot;support1&quot;&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifeoffice Office Family Product Support Lifecycle FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;, and extended support ended on July 14, 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;support1&quot; /&gt;.

==Editions==
Office 2000 was available in five suites&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20000815055606/http://www.microsoft.com/office/order/default.htm#price] Office 2000 Suite Contents and Pricing @ archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;:

The application version descriptors were changed from Microsoft's previous version numbering scheme to highlight their Y2K compliance. The previous applications had numbers 97/98; 2000 was chosen for all the new versions. Word 97, Excel 97, PowerPoint 97, Outlook 98, Access 97, Publisher 98, FrontPage 98 and Project 98 were the predecessors to Office 2000's applications. PhotoDraw's predecessor was [[Microsoft Picture It!|Picture It!]].

Microsoft Office 2000 Personal was a SKU solely designed for the Japanese market, including Word 2000, Excel 2000 and Outlook 2000.[http://www.microsoft.com/japan/Office/previous/2000/Personal/package.mspx] This compilation would later become widespread as Microsoft Office 2003 Basic.

==Service releases==
Office 2000 was the first version of Office to use [[Windows Installer]] technology. This allowed service packs to be [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstreamed]] into the original release version. The first update was called Service Release 1 (SR-1). Subsequent updates were called service packs. SP3 was the last service pack.

==Easter eggs in Office 2000==
[[Microsoft Excel]] contained a hidden game called Dev Hunter, [[Microsoft Access]] had a hidden 8 ball toy, and [[Microsoft Word]] had team development credits.

==Tips==
[[File:Button image.tif |thumb|]]
In Word PowerPoint or Excel, you can change a button image (the picture on a button such as the bold button) by opening one of the programs clicking on the tools menu and then by clicking customize. right click the button you want to edit and select &quot;edit button image&quot;. when you are done editing the image you can revery back to the buttons original look by doing every thing the same but instead of selecting &quot;edit button image&quot; select &quot;reset&quot;.
