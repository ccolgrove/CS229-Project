&quot;'''Sails'''&quot; is a song by [[Elton John]] with lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]]. It is the sixth track off his first album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''.

==Musical structure==
The songs open with an [[Feedback|electric guitar feedback]] accompagnied by piano chords. The song then kicks off to a rather psychedelic feel with [[Wah-wah pedal]]-oriented guitars and a distorted electric piano, carrying an R&amp;B-sound. Overall, the song could be described as &quot;[[Psychedelic pop]]&quot;, due to the vocal. But the heavy drumming and syncopated bass and guitar overshadow the &quot;pop&quot; feel.

==Lyrical meaning==
The lyrics are very complex. It is relatively a short lyric, but the cryptic lyrics make it a song that seems long. But basically, it is just two people meeting by the waterside watching the horizon. The chorus goes:

&quot;''While the seagulls were screaming&lt;br /&gt;
''Lucy was eating&lt;br /&gt;
''Then we hauled up our colors&lt;br /&gt;
''The way that mother had told us&lt;br /&gt;
''And together we just watched the sails''&quot; 

==Performances==
It was never played in concert. It was however played in various radio shows John did after the release of the album.
