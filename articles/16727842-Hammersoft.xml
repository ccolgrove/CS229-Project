==Regular season==
One of Denver's new major additions was rookie running back [[Bobby Humphrey]], who rushed for 1,151 yards, caught 22 passes for 156 yards, and scored 8 touchdowns. Humphrey gave the Broncos a powerful running attack that they lacked in their previous Super Bowl seasons. The defense had a new weapon as well: rookie free safety [[Steve Atwater]]. Together with veteran defensive backs [[Dennis Smith (American football)|Dennis Smith]], [[Wymon Henderson]] and [[Tyrone Braxton]], the Broncos secondary combined for 14 interceptions.  Braxton lead the team with 6, which he returned for 103 yards and a touchdown, while also recovering 2 fumbles.  Another new addition was defensive end [[Ron Holmes]], who recorded 9 sacks.  Holmes, along with veteran linebackers [[Karl Mecklenburg]] (7.5 sacks and 4 fumble recoveries) and [[Simon Fletcher (American football)|Simon Fletcher]] (12 sacks) gave Denver one of the top defensive lines in the AFC.

Veteran receiver [[Vance Johnson]] had the best season of his career, catching 76 passes for 1,095 yards and 7 touchdowns, while also returning 12 punts for 118 yards. However, quarterback [[John Elway]] played inconsistently during the regular season, throwing just as many interceptions as touchdowns (18) and recording only a 73.7 passer rating.
