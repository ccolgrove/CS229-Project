'''CamanÃ©''' ([[Oeiras]], [[1967]]-) is a male vocalist, and a forerunner of the new generation of [[fado]] male singers. &quot;The greatest fadista since Amalia Rodrigues and Maria da Fe,&quot; is how British biographer David Bret, describes him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

He started gaining recognition in [[Portugal]] in 1979 after winning the 'Grande Noite do Fado' (Great Fado Night).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} After this first step, he continued to consistently work toward commercial success with critically well-received albums and a concert tour that touched upon both large and small venues, including 'Casas de Fado' (fado clubs) in Lisbon. He toured outside Portugal to sold-out audiences throughout his European tour.

He has released six million-selling albums: ''Uma Noite de Fados'' (1995), ''Na Linha da Vida'' (1998) marking the beginning of three records produced by [[JosÃ© MÃ¡rio Branco]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p372794/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Camane|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Esta Coisa da Alma'' (2000), ''Pelo Dia Dentro'' (2001), ''Como sempre... Como dantes'' (live in 2003), and ''Sempre De Mim'' (2008). These have been released in several European and Asian countries.
He has been distinguished with several awards for his voice and talent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Camane was formerly married to another great fadista, Aldina Duarte.  CamanÃ© (and his short height) is frequently mentioned by the fictional fadista [[Rouxinol Faduncho]], in ''Blablabla do Artista'' (the intro for his second [[CD]]) and in ''Cais do SodrÃ©''.
