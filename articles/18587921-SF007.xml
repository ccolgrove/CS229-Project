'''Ubuntu Live USB creator''' (usb-creator) is an official tool to create [[Live USB]]s of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] from the Live CD or from an [[ISO image]]. The tool is by default included in all releases after Ubuntu 8.04, and can be installed on Ubuntu 8.04. A [[KDE]] frontend was released for Ubuntu 8.10, and is currently included by default in [[Kubuntu]] installations. To run the current version on Ubuntu or other distributions, enter either usb-creator-gtk or usb-creator-kde at the command line.

==Features==
*Install bootloader to USB device
*Optional [[Persistence (computer science)|persistence]] (all changes made to the system are saved, unlike a [[Live CD]])
*Progress indicator
*Does not format the device

==Future development==
The tool is available for Ubuntu ([[GNOME]] (Since 11.04 also their own called [[Unity (user interface)|Unity]])) or Kubuntu ([[KDE]]) and also for Windows starting in Ubuntu 10.10 &quot;Maverick Meerkat&quot; but only accessible by inserting the Live CD into a CD-ROM drive with Windows running.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/devweek0809/InstallerTeam &quot;There will eventually be KDE and Windows frontends&quot; - Evan Dandrea]&lt;/ref&gt;
