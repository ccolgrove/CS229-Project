The post was a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] level post and generally ranked above the three service ministers, some of whom, however, continued to also serve in Cabinet.

==History==

Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, concerns about British forces being understrength led in 1936 to the creation of the post of [[Minister for Coordination of Defence]] by Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]]. The post was abolished by Baldwin's successor [[Neville Chamberlain]] in April 1940.

On his appointment as Prime Minister in May 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] created for himself the new post of Minister of Defence. The post was created in response to previous criticism that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the [[World War II|war]].  In 1946, the post became the only cabinet level post representing the military, with the three service ministers - the [[Secretary of State for War]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], and the [[Secretary of State for Air]], now formally subordinated to the Minister of Defence.

In 1964, the creation of a single merged [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and the abolition of the separate service ministries in the UK led to the creation of the new post of [[Secretary of State for Defence]], more popularly known as Defence Secretary.
