==History==
=== Early Years===
The first baseball team at Bowling Green Normal College was established in 1915 under the guide of head coach [[F.G. Beyerman]] and finished their inaugural campaign at 1-3.  The program would not reach varsity level until 1918, playing their first game on May 3, 1918 defeating [[Defiance College]] 4&amp;ndash;3 in 7 innings.  The Normals would finish the 1918 season 2-1 defeating [[Bluffton College]] 6&amp;ndash;5 and losing a rematch with Defiance 13&amp;ndash;3.

Bowling Green joined the Northwestern Ohio Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1921 and finished the season 6-1-2, good enough to make the Normals NWOIAA champions in their first year in the conference.  The 1921 Normals baseball team would be the first athletic program at Bowling Green to win a title of any sort.

Bowling Green would win six more NWOIAA titles (1922, 1925â26, 1928, 1931â32), before deciding to leave the conference and become an independent.

===Move to the MAC===
In 1953, Bowling Green would become a member of the Mid-American Conference, following rival and former NWOIAA conference mate [[Toledo Rockets|Toledo]] who joined in 1951.  In their first season in the MAC, the Falcons would go 8-6 including a 4-4 conference record which would place them 3rd in the conference.  Bowling Green would not win their first MAC crown until 1972 when they posted a 24-12-2 record (6-2-1 MAC) and were invited to the NCAA District IV Tournament.  The Falcons would defeat [[Northern Illinois Huskies|Northern Illinois]] 2&amp;ndash;0 and [[Central Michigan Chippewas|Central Michigan]] 7&amp;ndash;5 in 10 innings, but fell just short of a birth to the [[College World Series]] as they lost 7&amp;ndash;2 and 7&amp;ndash;5 to [[Iowa Hawkeyes|Iowa]].

Since moving to the MAC, Bowling Green has won six more regular season championships (1995, 1998â99, 2001â02, 2008) and two conference tournament championships (1998â99).  The Falcons were the MAC's representative in the [[1999 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament]] and were selected to compete as the 4th seed in the Columbus Regional, hosted by [[Ohio State Buckeyes baseball|Ohio State]].  The Falcons would go 0-2, losing to 1st seed Ohio State 4&amp;ndash;1 and then lost in the loser's bracket 10&amp;ndash;5 to the 2nd seed [[Nebraska Cornhuskers baseball|Nebraska]].

===Danny Schmitz era===
Since 1991, Danny Schmitz has been the head coach of the Bowling Green Falcons having replaced Ed Platzer.  In Schmitz's first season as head coach, the Falcons posted a 16-39-1 (7-23) record and finished 9th in the MAC.  Schmitz would turn the program around in his fourth season (1994) posting a 29-18 (16-10) record, finishing 3rd in the MAC.  He would lead the Falcons to their second MAC crown the following year posting a 34-20 (22-8) record.

Under Schmitz' watch, the Falcons have won five regular-season conference championships, six East Division titles, two conference tournament championships, and an NCAA Tournament appearance.  Schmitz is second longest tenured coach in the program's history, only behind Warren E. Steller (31 seasons) and is the programs all-time winningest manager with 489 wins.  Schmitz became the program's all-time winningest coach on March 26, 2000 after the Falcons defeated [[Buffalo Bulls|Buffalo]] 3&amp;ndash;2.

===Warren E. Steller Field===
{{Main|Warren E. Steller Field}}
Warren E. Steller Field has been home to the Falcons baseball team since 1964.  The field is named in honor of [[Warren E. Steller]], a former instructor at the school who coached the school's football (1924â34) and baseball (1925, 1928â59) teams.  The stadium is located on the Bowling Green campus, next to [[BGSU Ice Arena]] and across the street from Perry Field House.
