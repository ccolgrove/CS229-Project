'''Tatars''' ([[Tatar language|Tatar]]: {{lang|tat|''Tatarlar'' / Ð¢Ð°ÑÐ°ÑÐ»Ð°Ñ}}, sometimes spelled '''Tartars''') are a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] speaking ethnic group &lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/584107/Tatar&lt;/ref&gt;, numbering roughly  7 million. 
The majority of Tatars live in the [[Russian Federation]], with a population of around 5.5 million, about 2 million of which in the [[Republics of Russia|republic]] of [[Tatarstan]].
Significant minority populations are found in [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Ukraine]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name=jp&gt;Population estimates by the   &quot;Joshua Project&quot;, a ministry of the &quot;Frontier Mission Fellowship&quot; for [[Evangelicalist]]Â [[Christian proselytization]]Â  ; {{cite web|author=Joshua Project |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peoples.php?rop3=109874 |title=Tatar Ethnic People in all Countries |publisher=Joshua Project |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tatars originate with the [[Tatar confederation]] in the north-eastern [[Gobi]] desert in the 5th century. After subjugation in the 9th century by the [[Liao dynasty|Khitans]], they migrated southward. In the 13th century, they were subjugated by the [[Mongol Empire]] under [[Genghis Khan]]. Under the leadership of his grandson [[Batu Khan]], they moved westwards, forming part of the [[Golden Horde]] which dominated the [[Eurasian steppe]] during the 14th and 15th centuries. 
In Europe, they were assimilated by the local populations or their name spread to the conquered peoples: [[Kipchaks]], [[Kimaks]] and others; and elsewhere with [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]-speaking peoples, as well as with remnants of the ancient [[Greek colonies]] in the [[Crimea]] and Caucasians in the [[Caucasus]].

[[Siberian Tatars]] are survivors of the Turkic  population of the [[Ural (region)|Ural]]-[[Altay Mountains|Altaic]] region, mixed to some extent with the speakers of [[Uralic languages]], as well as with [[Mongolic languages|Mongols]]. 

The three ethnic descendants of the  13th-century westward migration are [[Volga Tatars]], [[Lipka Tatars]] and [[Crimean Tatars]], most of whom adopted [[Islam]] in the medieval period.

Tatars comprise a spectrum of physical appearance, ranging from [[Mongoloid]] and [[Caucasoid]] or [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|a mixture of both]] and have an Asian origin.

==Name==
{{wiktionary|Tatar}}
The name ''Tatar'' likely originated amongst the nomadic [[Tatar confederation]] of northeastern [[Mongolia]] in the region around [[Lake Baikal]] in the beginning of the 5th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaTatar&quot;&gt;'''Tatar'''. (2006). In ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''. Retrieved October 28, 2006, from EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Online: http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9071375&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese term is Dadan (éé¼) and is a comparatively specific term for nomads to the north, emerging in the late Tang. Other names include Dadan and Tatan. The name &quot;Tatars&quot; was used an alternative term for the [[Shiwei]], a nomadic confederation to which these Tatar people belonged.

As various of these nomadic groups became part of [[Genghis Khan]]'s army in the early 13th century, a fusion of [[Mongol]] and Turkic elements took place, and the invaders of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] and the [[Pannonian Basin]] became known to Europeans as Tatars or Tartars (see [[Tatar yoke]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaTatar&quot; /&gt; 
After the breakup of the [[Mongol Empire]], the Tatars became especially identified with the western part of the empire, known as the [[Golden Horde]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BritannicaTatar&quot; /&gt;

The form ''Tartar'' has its origins in either Latin or French language, coming to Western European languages from Turkish and Persian language ''TÄtÄr'' (&quot;mounted courier, mounted messenger; postrider&quot;). From the beginning the extra ''r'' was present in the Western forms, and according to the Oxford English Dictionary this was most likely due to an association with ''[[Tartarus]]'' (Hell in Greek mythology), though some claim that the name ''Tartar'' was in fact used amongst the Tatars themselves. Nowadays ''Tatar'' is usually used to refer to the people, but ''Tartar'' is still almost always used for derived terms such as tartar sauce or steak tartare.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50247333 &quot;Tartar, Tatar, n.2 (a.)&quot;]. (1989). In ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Retrieved 11 September 2008, from Oxford English Dictionary Online.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many Kazan/Volga Tatars prefer to be called Bulgars and reject the Tatar name- this is called [[Bulgarism]]. Bulgarism pertains to the notion that the Volga/Kazan Tatars are actual Bulgars who didn't mix with any other group (additionally, Tatarstan was called Bolgaristan until 1919).

==History==
{{main|Tartary|Little Tartary|History of Tatarstan|Mongol invasion of Rus'|Golden Horde}}
[[File:Witsen - Tartaria.jpg|thumb|Map of ''Tartaria'' (1705)]]
During the 11th to 16th centuries, Tatar tribes  lived in what is now Russia and Kazakhstan. The present territory of [[Tatarstan]] was inhabited by the [[Volga Bulgaria|Volga Bulgars]] who settled on the Volga in the 8th century and converted to Islam in 922 during the missionary work of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]. On the Volga, the Bulgars mingled with [[Scythian]]- and Uralic-speaking peoples. After the [[Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria|Mongol invasion]], Bulgaria was defeated, ruined and incorporated in the [[Golden Horde]]. Much of the population survived, and there was a certain degree of mixing between it and the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] Tatars of the Horde during the ensuing period. 
The group as a whole accepted the ethnonym &quot;Tatars&quot; (finally in the end of 19th century; although the name [[Bulgars]] persisted in some places; the majority identified themselves simply as ''the Muslims'') and the language of the Kipchaks; on the other hand, the invaders eventually converted to Islam. As the Horde disintegrated in the 15th century, the area became the territory of the [[Kazan khanate]], which was [[Russo-Kazan wars|ultimately conquered by Russia]] in the 16th century.

==Subgroups==
The bulk of the Tatar population are [[Volga Tatars]], centered on [[Tatarstan]].
There are scattered minority groups distinct from the Volga Tatars, notably the [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Lipka Tatars]] and [[Astrakhan Tatars]]Â in EuropeÂ and the [[Siberian Tatars]]Â in Asia.

===Volga Tatars===
{{main|Volga Tatars}}
The main group of the Volga Tatars are further subdivided into dialect groups. The majority of Volga Tatars are Kazan Tatars. It is disputed that the Volga Tatars are Turkic, since they are mostly descended from the Bulgars, whose origin is strongly disputed -there is strong evidence that the Bulgars were not Turkic,&lt;ref&gt;http://sitemaker.umich.edu/mladjov/files/bulgarian_rulers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samoistina.at.ua/2/similarities.htm |title=Ethnological traits of the ancient Iranian culture in modern-day Bulgarian culture |publisher=Samoistina.at.ua |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=M3 Web - http://m3web.bg |url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=117192the |title=Bulgarian Expedition Travels to Iran in Search of Roots: Bulgarian Expedition Travels to Iran in Search of Roots - Novinite.com - Sofia News Agency |publisher=Novinite.com |date=2010-06-16 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thearchaeologicalbox.com/en/news/dna-analysis-reveals-pamir-origin-bulgarians |title=DNA Analysis Reveals Pamir Origin of Bulgarians |publisher=TheArchaeologicalBox.com |date=2010-06-12 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sofiamorningnews.net/ |title=(published by Sofia News Agency, novinite.com) |publisher=Sofia Morning News |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groznijat.tripod.com/b_lang/bl_a_v.html |title=Old Bulgar words - A-V |publisher=Groznijat.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3236.htm |title=Bulgaria |publisher=State.gov |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brockhaus Conversations-Lexikon Bd. 7.

The major group are the Kazan Tatars in Tatarstan proper. They are distinct from the MiÅÃ¤r group and the Qasim group. 
A minority of Christianized Volga Tatars are known as [[KerÃ¤Åens]].

====Kazan (Qazan) Tatars====
[[Image:Tatars in Kazan 1885 2.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Kazan Tatars]]

In the 1910s the Kazan Tatars numbered about half a million in the [[Kazan Governorate]] ([[Tatarstan]], the Kazan Tatars' historical motherland), about 400,000 in each of the governments of [[Ufa]], 100,000 in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]] and [[Simbirsk]], and about 30,000 in [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]], [[Saratov]], [[Tambov]], [[Penza]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Perm]] and [[Orenburg]]. Some 15,000 belonging to the same stem had migrated to [[Ryazan]], or had been settled as prisoners in the 16th and 17th centuries in [[Lithuania]] ([[Vilnius]], [[Hrodna|Grodno]] and [[Podolia]]). Some 2000 resided in [[St. Petersburg, Russia|St. Petersburg]], where they were mostly employed as coachmen and waiters in restaurants. Later they were never counted as separate group of the Tatars.

The Kazan Tatars speak a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language (with a big complement of Russian and Arabic words; see [[Tatar language]]). They have been described as generally middle-sized, broad-shouldered, and the majority have brown and green eyes, a straight nose and salient cheek bones.&lt;ref name=&quot;narod1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xacitarxan.narod.ru/antropos.htm |title=ÐÐ½ÑÑÐ¾Ð¿Ð¾Ð»Ð¾Ð³Ð¸ÑÐµÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ ÐÐ±Ð»Ð¸Ðº Ð¢Ð°ÑÐ°Ñ |publisher=Xacitarxan.narod.ru |date= |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because their ancestors number not only Turkic peoples and [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]], but also [[East Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian peoples]] as well, many Kazan Tatars tend to have Caucasoid faces. Around 33.5% belong to Southern Caucasoid, 27.5% to Northern Caucasoid, 24.5% to Lapponoid and 14.5% to Mongoloid.&lt;ref name=&quot;narod1&quot;/&gt;  Most Kazan Tatars practice [[Sunni Islam]].

Before 1917 in Russia, polygamy was practised only by the wealthier classes and was a waning institution.

The Volga Tatars with 15 for 19 centuries a literary language had a [[Old Tatar language|Old Tatar (TurkiÑ) language]] (however, [[iske imla|being written in Arabic alphabet]], it was spelled variously in the different regions). The old literary language included a lot of Arabic and Persian words. Nowadays the literary language includes European and Russian words instead of Arabic.

Volga Tatars number nearly 8 millions, mostly in Russia and the republics of the former [[Soviet Union]]. While the bulk of the population is to be found in [[Tatarstan]] (nearly 2 million) and neighbouring regions, significant numbers of Kazan Tatars live in Central Asia, Siberia and the Caucasus. Outside of Tatarstan, urban Tatars usually speak [[Russian language|Russian]] as their first language (in cities such as Moscow, [[Saint-Petersburg]], [[Nizhniy Novgorod]], [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], and cities of the [[Ural (region)|Ural]] and western Siberia) and other languages in a worldwide diaspora.

There is ethnic nationalist movement among Kazan Tatars which stresses descent from the [[Bulgars]]Â and is known as [[Bulgarism]] - there have been grafitti on the walls in the streets of Kazan with phrases such as 'Bulgaria is alive&quot;.

====MiÅÃ¤rs====
MiÅÃ¤r Tatars (or Mishers) are a group of Tatars speaking a dialect of the [[Tatar language]]. They are descendants of [[Cuman]]-[[Kipchaks]] in the Middle [[Oka River]] area and Meschiora where they mixed with the local  [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] tribes. Nowadays they live in [[Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]], [[Tambov Oblast|Tambov]], [[Penza Oblast|Penza]], [[Ryazan Oblast|Ryazan]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Nizhegorodskaya]] oblasts of Russia and in [[Bashkortostan]] and [[Mordovia]]. They lived near and along the Volga River, in Tatarstan.

====QasÃ­m Tatars====
The Western Tatars have their capital in the town of QasÃ­m ([[Kasimov]] in Russian transcription) in [[Ryazan Oblast]], with a Tatar population of 1100.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} See &quot;[[Qasim Khanate]]&quot; for their history.

====Noqrat Tatars====
Tatars live in Russia's [[Kirov Oblast]] and [[Tatarstan]].

====KerÃ¤Åens====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ã]] --&gt;
{{main|KerÃ¤Åens}}
Some Tatars were forcibly Christianized by [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan the Terrible]] during the 16th century and later in the 18th century.

Some scientists suppose that [[Suars]] were ancestors of the KerÃ¤Åen Tatars, and they had been converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity|Christianity]] by Armenians in the 6th century, while they lived in the Caucasus. Suars, like other tribes (which later converted to Islam) became [[Volga Bulgars]] and later the modern [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] (mostly [[Christians]]) and Tatars (mostly [[Muslims]]).

KerÃ¤Åen Tatars live all over [[Tatarstan]] and in [[Udmurtia]], [[Bashkortostan|Bashkiria]] and [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]]. Some of them did assimilate among [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]] and Tatars with [[Sunni Muslim]] self-identification. Eighty years of [[Atheism|Atheist]]ic Soviet rule made Tatars of both confessions not as religious as they were. As such, differences between Tatars and KerÃ¤Åen Tatars now is only that KerÃ¤Åens have Russian names.

Some Turkic ([[Cumans|Kuman]]) tribes in [[Golden Horde]] converted to Christianity in the 13th and 14th centuries ([[Catholicism]] and [[Nestorianism]]). Some prayers, written in that time in the ''[[Codex Cumanicus]]'', sound like modern KerÃ¤Åen prayers, but there is no information about the connection between Christian Kumans and modern KerÃ¤Åens.

===Siberian Tatars===
[[File:MinusinskTatars.jpg|thumb|A group of Tatars at [[Minusinsk]]]]
{{main|Siberian Tatars}}

http://www.nsu.ru/education/etno/tatary/tat14.htm

The [[Siberia]]n Tatars occupy three distinct regions&amp;mdash;a strip running west to east from [[Tobolsk]] to [[Tomsk]]&amp;mdash;the [[Altay Mountains|Altay]] and its spurs&amp;mdash;and South Yeniseisk. They originated in the agglomerations of various Uralo-Altaic stems that, in the region north of the Altay, reached some degree of culture between the 4th and the 5th centuries, but were subdued and enslaved by the Mongols. According to the 2002 census there are 500,000 Tatars in Siberia, but 300,000 of them are [[Volga Tatars]] who settled in Siberia during periods of colonization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newasp.omskreg.ru/hist/fotatlas/rezumeen.htm Siberian Tatars]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baraba Tatars====
{{main|Baraba Tatars}}
http://www.nsu.ru/education/etno/tatary/tat19.htm

The Baraba Tatars take their name from one of their stems (Barama). After a strenuous resistance to Russian conquest, and much suffering at a later period from Kyrgyz and Kalmyk raids, they now live by agriculture&amp;mdash;either in separate villages or along with Russians.

They numbered at least 9.000 in 1990.

===Chinese Tatars===
{{main|Chinese Tatars}}
A significant number of Volga Tatars emigrated during the [[Russian Civil War]], mostly to Turkey and [[Harbin]], China. [http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/premade/9052/autonomy.htm According to the Chinese government], there are still 5,100 Tatars living in Xinjiang province.

===Astrakhan Tatars===
{{main|Astrakhan Tatars}}
The Astrakhan Tatars (around 80,000) are a group of Tatars, descendants of the [[Astrakhan Khanate]]'s agricultural population, who live mostly in [[Astrakhan Oblast]]. For the 2000 Russian census 2000, most Astrakhan Tatars declared themselves simply as Tatars and few declared themselves as Astrakhan Tatars. A large number of Volga Tatars live in Astrakhan Oblast and differences between them have been disappearing.

The Astrakhan Tatars are further divided into the Kundrov Tatars and the Karagash Tatars.  The latter are also at times called the Karashi Tatars.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, James S., ''An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires''. (Westport: Greenwood Press, 1994) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Text from Britannica 1911:
:The [[Astrakhan]] Tatars number about 10,000 and are, with the [[Kalmyks]], all that now remains of the once so powerful Astrakhan empire. They also are agriculturists and gardeners; while some 12,000 Kundrovsk Tatars still continue the nomadic life of their ancestors.

While Astrakhan (Ãsterxan) Tatar is a mixed dialect, around 43,000 have assimilated to the Middle (i.e., Kazan) dialect. Their ancestors are [[Khazars]], [[Kipchaks]] and some [[Volga Bulgars]]. (Volga Bulgars had trade colonies in modern [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan]] and [[Volgograd Oblast|Volgograd]] oblasts of Russia.)

The Astrakhan Tatars also assimilated the [[Agrzhan]].&lt;ref&gt;Wixman, Ronald. ''The Peoples of the USSR: An Ethnographic Handbook''. (Armonk, New York: M. E. Sharpe, Inc, 1984) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tatars of East Europe===
====Lithuanian Tatars====
[[File:Bronson 1973.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Charles Bronson]] was born to a Lithuanian immigrant father of Lipka Tatar ancestry.]]
{{main|Lipka Tatars}}
After [[Tokhtamysh]] was defeated by [[Tamerlane]], some of his clan sought refuge in [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. They were given land and nobility in return for military service and were known as [[Lipka Tatars]]. They are known to have taken part in the [[Battle of Grunwald]].

Another group appeared in [[Jagoldai]] Duchy (Lithuania's vassal) near modern [[Kursk]] in 1437 and disappeared later.

====Belarusian Tatars====
{{See|Islam in Belarus}}

Islam spread in Belarus from the 14th to the 16th century. The process was encouraged by the Lithuanian princes, who invited [[Tatar]] Muslims from the [[Crimea]] and the [[Golden Horde]] as guards of state borders. Already in the 14th century the Tatars had been offered a settled way of life, state posts and service positions. By the end of the 16th century over 100,000 Tatars settled in Belarus and [[Lithuania]], including those hired to government service, those who moved there voluntarily, prisoners of war, etc.

Tatars in Belarus generally follow [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] Islam. Some groups have accepted [[Christianity]] and been assimilated, but most adhere to Muslim religious traditions, which ensures their definite endogamy and preservation of ethnic features. Interethnic marriages with representatives of Belarusian, Polish, Lithuanian, Russian nationalities are not rare, but do not result in total assimilation.

Originating from different ethnic associations, Belarusian (and also Polish and Lithuanian) Tatars back in ancient days lost their native language and adopted Belarusian, Polish and Russian. However, the liturgy is conducted in the [[Arabic language]], which is known by the clergymen. There are an estimated 5,000-10,000 Tatars in Belarus.

====Polish Tatars====
:''Main articles: [[Lipka Tatars]] and [[Islam in Poland]]''
[[Image:Tatarian Mosque Bohoniki Poland.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Tatar]] mosque in the village of [[Bohoniki]], [[Poland]] ]]
From the 13th to 17th centuries various groups of Tatars settled and/or found refuge within the [[Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth]].
This was promoted especially by the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, because of their reputation as skilled warriors. The Tatar settlers were all granted with [[szlachta]] (nobility) status, a tradition that was preserved until the end of the Commonwealth in the 18th century. They included the [[Lipka Tatars]] (13-14 centuries) as well as Crimean and [[Nogai people|Nogay]] Tatars (15th-16th centuries), all of which were noticeable in Polish military history, as well as [[Volga Tatars]] (16th-17th centuries). They all mostly settled in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], lands that are now in [[Lithuania]] and [[Belarus]].

Various estimates of the number of Tatars in the Commonwealth in the 17th century range from 15,000 persons to 60 villages with mosques and Egyptian churches, because of the invasion of the Egyptians on 1256. Numerous royal privileges, as well as internal autonomy granted by the monarchs allowed the Tatars to preserve their religion, traditions and culture over the centuries. The Tatars were allowed to intermarry with Christians, a thing uncommon in Europe at the time. The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May Constitution]] of 1791 gave the Tatars representation in the Polish [[Sejm]].

Although by the 18th century the Tatars adopted the local language, the Islamic religion and many Tatar traditions (e.g. the sacrifice of bulls in their mosques during the main religious festivals) were preserved. This led to formation of a distinctive Muslim culture, in which the elements of Muslim orthodoxy mixed with religious tolerance and a relatively liberal society. For instance, the women in Lipka Tatar society traditionally had the same rights and status as men, and could attend non-segregated schools.

About 5,500 Tatars lived within the inter-war boundaries of Poland (1920â1939), and a Tatar cavalry unit had fought for the country's independence. The Tatars had preserved their cultural identity and sustained a number of Tatar organisations, including a Tatar archives, and a museum in Wilno ([[Vilnius]]).

The Tatars suffered serious losses during World War II and furthermore, after the border change in 1945 a large part of them found themselves in the [[Soviet Union]]. It is estimated that about 3000 Tatars live in present-day Poland, of which about 500 declared Tatar (rather than Polish) nationality in the 2002 census. There are two Tatar villages ([[Bohoniki]] and [[Kruszyniany]]) in the north-east of present-day Poland, as well as urban Tatar communities in [[Warsaw]], [[GdaÅsk]], [[BiaÅystok]], and [[GorzÃ³w Wielkopolski]]. Tatars in Poland sometimes have a Muslim surname with a Polish ending: ''Ryzwanowicz''; another surname sometimes adopted by more assimilated Tatars is ''TaterczyÅski'', literally &quot;son of a Tatar&quot;.

The Tatars were relatively very noticeable in the Commonwealth military as well as in Polish and Lithuanian political and intellectual life for such a small community.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} In modern-day Poland, their presence is also widely known, due in part to their noticeable role in the historical novels of [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], which are universally recognized in Poland. A number of Polish intellectual figures have also been Tatars, e.g. the prominent historian Jerzy Åojek.

A small community of Polish speaking Tatars settled in [[Brooklyn]], New York City in the early 1900s. They established a mosque that is still in use today.

Tatars were present on the territory of today's [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] since the 13th century. In Romania, according to the 2002 census, 24,000 people declared their ethnicity as Tatar, most of them being Crimean Tatars living in [[ConstanÅ£a County]] in the region of [[Dobruja]]. The Crimean Tatars were colonized there by the [[Ottoman Empire]] beginning with the 17th Century.

==Tatar language==
{{main|Tatar language}}

The [[Tatar language]] together with the [[Bashkir language]] forms the Kypchak-Bolgar (also &quot;Uralo-Caspian&quot;) group within the [[Kypchak languages]] (Northwestern Turkic).

There are three Tatar dialects: Eastern, Central, Western.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gabdulkhay Akhatov|Akhatov G.]] &quot;Tatar dialectology&quot;. Kazan, 1984.(Tatar language)&lt;/ref&gt;
The Western dialect (Misher) is spoken mostly by MishÃ¤rs, the Central dialect is spoken by Kazan and Astrakhan Tatars, and the Eastern (Sibir) dialect is spoken by Siberian Tatars in western [[Siberia]]. All three dialects have subdialects.
Central Tatar is the base of literary Tatar.

Tatar was written with the Arabic alphabet prior to 1928, in the so-called [[Ä°ske imlÃ¢ alphabet]] and from 1920 to 1928 in the [[YaÃ±a imlÃ¢ alphabet]].
The Soviet Union in 1928 introduced a Latin orthography, known as [[JaÅalif]]. JaÅalif was replaced by a  [[Tatar_alphabet#Cyrillic_version|Cyrillic orthography]] in 1940.
After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], use of JaÅalif was revived, but the Cyrillic script was again enforced in 2002, when  the Russian Federation passed a controversial law was enforcing the use Cyrillic for all official languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3718174.stm Russia reconsiders Cyrillic law] BBC News, 5 October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Eponyms==
In [[France]], a type of minced, raw meat came to have the name [[steak tartare]], because of the association of raw meat dishes with legends of &quot;Tarters&quot; softening horse meat by riding with it under their saddles. ''Sauce tartare'', or tarter sauce, seems to have obtained its name either from use on steak tartare[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-tartar-sauce.htm], or because the perception of &quot;Tarters&quot; as being &quot;rough&quot; caused their name to be an adjective for roughness, as with the texture of the sauce[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1593/what-do-steak-tartare-tartar-sauce-and-dental-tartar-have-in-common].
