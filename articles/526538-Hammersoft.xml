'''Barry Manilow''' (born June 17, 1943&lt;ref name=&quot;gr&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Barry_Manilow.html Barry Manilow] at jewishvirtuallibrary.org&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American [[singer-songwriter]], [[musician]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], [[Theatrical producer|producer]], [[Conducting|conductor]], and performer, best known for such recordings as &quot;[[Could It Be Magic]]&quot;, &quot;[[Mandy (song)|Mandy]]&quot;, &quot;[[Can't Smile Without You]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Copacabana (song)|Copacabana (At the Copa)]].&quot;

In 1978, five of his albums were on the best-selling charts simultaneously, a feat equalled only by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Johnny Mathis]]. He has recorded a string of [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard hit singles]] and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] albums that have resulted in his being named Radio &amp; Records number one [[Adult Contemporary]] artist and winning three straight [[American Music Awards]] for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist. Between 1974 - 1979 Manilow had 10 number 1 singles, five of which were consecutive. Several well-known entertainers have given Manilow their &quot;stamp of approval,&quot; including Sinatra, who was quoted in the 1970s regarding Manilow, &quot;He's next.&quot;  In 1988, [[Bob Dylan]] stopped Manilow at a party, hugged him and said, &quot;Don't stop what you're doing, man. We're all inspired by you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Butler, ''Barry Manilow'', Omnibus Press, 2002. p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as producing and arranging albums for other artists, such as [[Bette Midler]] and [[Dionne Warwick]], Manilow has written songs for musicals, films, and commercials. From February 2005 to December 30, 2009, he was the headliner at the [[Las Vegas Hilton]], performing hundreds of shows before ending his relationship with the hotel. From March 2010, he has headlined at the [[Paris Las Vegas|Paris Hotel in Las Vegas]]. He has sold more than 80 million records worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.vegas.com/shows/showtimes2.jsp?show=705#show_review |title=Barry Manilow &amp;#124; VEGAS.com |publisher=Shop.vegas.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically Barry Manilow supports [[Ron Paul]], a [[libertarianism|libertarian]] Republican, although he has historically supported national Democrat candidates including the Clintons and Barack Obama.&lt;ref name=&quot;rp&quot;&gt;[http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/09/ron-paul-barry-manilow-presidential-race-/1 USA Today] September 15, 2011 '''Barry Manilow is a Ron Paul Fan'''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Manilow was born '''Barry Alan Pincus''' to Harold Pincus and Edna Manilow. His mother's family was Jewish, while his father, who was often known by the surname &quot;Keliher,&quot; was born to a Jewish father and Irish American mother.  Barry's name was changed to Barry Manilow at the time of his Bar Mitzvah, adopting his mother's maiden name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/megan-smolenyak-smolenyak/happy-st-patricks-day-bar_b_490971.html |title=Megan Smolenyak: Happy St. Patrick's Day, Barry Manilow! |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reared in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|the community of Williamsburg in northern]] Brooklyn, Barry attended nearby [[Eastern District High School]], from which he graduated in 1961. In the same year, he enrolled in the [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] performing arts school, while working at CBS to pay his expenses.

At CBS, in 1964, Manilow met [[Bro Herrod]], a director, who asked him to arrange some songs for a musical adaptation of the [[melodrama]], ''The Drunkard.'' Instead, Manilow wrote an entire original score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher= Music Theatre International|date= |title= The Drunkard|url= http://www.mtishows.com/show_history.asp?ID=000033|accessdate= 2007-03-01}}  {{Wayback|url=http://www.mtishows.com/show_history.asp?ID=000033|date =20080313055107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herrod used his composition in the [[Off Broadway]] musical, which enjoyed an eight year run at New York's [[13th Street Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher= SouthCoastToday.com |date= July 26, 2006 |title= A spirited musical: Clap, hiss and sing along as MAC stages historical temperance play scored by a young Barry Manilow |url= http://www.southcoasttoday.com/daily/07-06/07-27-06/02coastin.htm |accessdate= 2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manilow then earned money by working as a pianist, producer, and [[arrangement|arranger]].

During this time he began to work as a commercial [[jingle]] writer,&lt;ref&gt;BarryNet â His Music â Commercial Jingles, [http://www.barrynethomepage.com/commercialjingles.html Barry Manilow - BarryNet - His Music - Commercial Jingles].

Many of those he wrote and/or composed he would also perform, including [[State Farm Insurance]] (&quot;Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there...&quot;), and [[Band-Aid]] (&quot;I am stuck on Band-Aid, 'cause Band-Aids stick on me!&quot;), for which he adopted a surprisingly convincing child-like voice. His singing-only credits include [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Pepsi]], [[Dr Pepper]], and the famed [[McDonald's]] &quot;You Deserve a Break Today&quot; campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Manilow |first= Barry|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1975|url=http://phillipsphiles.blogspot.com/2008/05/scooter-talk-blog-manilow-flashback_2316.html |title= Jingle Letter|work= |publisher=Scooter Talk |accessdate= January 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manilow won two [[Clio Awards]] in 1976 for his work for [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] and Band-Aid.&lt;ref&gt;BarryNet â The Man â Honors and Awards, [http://www.barrynethomepage.com/honorsandawards.html Barry Manilow - BarryNet - The Man - Honors and Awards].

By 1967, Manilow was the musical director for the [[WCBS-TV]] series ''Callback'', which premiered on January 27, 1968.  He next conducted and arranged for [[Ed Sullivan]]'s production company, arranging a new theme for ''The Late Show'', while still writing, producing, and singing his radio and television jingles.  At the same time, he and [[Jeanne Lucas (lounge singer)|Jeanne Lucas]] performed as a duo for a two-season run at New York's [[Upstairs at the Downstairs]] club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phillipsphiles.blogspot.com/2008/05/scooter-talk-blog-manilow-flashback-mid.html Barry Manilow Keeps Flying High Critics?

==Career==
===1970s===
Manilow's well-known association with [[Bette Midler]] began at the [[Continental Baths]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dilettantepress.com/barrymanilowstory.html Barry Manilow] {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accompanied her and other artists on the piano from 1970 to 1971, and Midler chose him to assist with the production of her first two albums, ''[[The Divine Miss M (album)|The Divine Miss M]]'' (1972) and ''[[Bette Midler (album)|Bette Midler]]'' (1973), and act as her musical director on ''The Divine Miss M'' tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betteontheboards.com/boards/tour-02.htm |title=Bette Midler: The Divine Miss M Tour (1972â73) |publisher=Betteontheboards.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manilow worked with Midler for four years, from 1971 to 1975. In 1974, [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] released Manilow's first album, ''[[Barry Manilow (1973 album)|Barry Manilow]],'' which offered an [[Eclecticism in music|eclectic]] mix of piano-driven pop and guitar-driven rock music, including a song that Manilow had composed for the 1972 war drama ''Parades.''

Among other songs on the album were &quot;Cloudburst&quot;, and &quot;[[Could It Be Magic]].&quot; The latter's music was based on Chopin's &quot;Prelude in C Minor, Opus 28, Number 20&quot;, and provided [[Donna Summer]] with one of her major hits. (It was also covered by [[Take That]] in the 1990s, as an up-beat disco version of the song. [[Take That]] have since performed Manilow's original version in their [[Beautiful World (Take That album)|Beautiful World]] Tour.) When Manilow's record company, Bell Records, merged with other labels, new entity [[Arista Records]] formed. Under the auspices of its head [[Clive Davis]] many artists were dropped. Davis was reassured by the Manilow acquisition after seeing him perform as the opening act at a [[Dionne Warwick]] concert.

The partnership began to gain traction in 1974, with the release of Manilow's second album, ''[[Barry Manilow II]],'' originally titled ''Sweetwater Jones'' on Bell Records and given its eventual title when reissued on Arista, which contained the breakthrough number-one hit, &quot;[[Mandy (song)|Mandy]].&quot; Manilow had not wanted to record &quot;Mandy,&quot; which had originally been titled &quot;Brandy&quot; and was co-written and originally recorded by Scott English, but the song was included at the insistence of Davis. Following the success of ''Barry Manilow II,'' the first Bell Records album release was re-mixed and re-issued on Arista Records as ''Barry Manilow I.'' When Manilow went on his first tour, he included, in his show, what he called &quot;A V.S.M.,&quot; or &quot;A Very Strange Medley.&quot; As previously stated, this was a sampling of some of the commercial jingles that he had written, composed, and/or sung. Beginning with Manilow's March 22, 1975, appearance on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' to promote the second album, a productive friendship with [[Dick Clark]] started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/american-bandstand/barry-manilow---minnie-riperton/episode/177909/summary.html?tag=ep_list;title;23 TV.com ''American Bandstand'' with Barry Manilow/Minnie Riperton on March 22, 1975]. Retrieved December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous appearances by Manilow on Clark's productions of ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]],'' singing his original seasonal favorite &quot;It's Just Another New Year's Eve,&quot; ''American Bandstand'' anniversary shows, ''[[American Music Award]]s'' performances, and his 1985 television movie ''Copacabana'' are among their projects together.

&quot;Mandy&quot; was the start of a string of hit singles and albums that lasted through the rest of the 1970s to the early 1980s, coming from the multi-platinum and multi-hit albums ''[[Tryin' to Get the Feeling]],'' ''[[This One's for You (Barry Manilow album)|This One's for You]],'' ''[[Even Now (Barry Manilow album)|Even Now]],'' and ''[[One Voice (Barry Manilow album)|One Voice]]''. Despite being a songwriter in his own right, several of Manilow's commercial successes were with songs by others. Among hits he did not write or compose are &quot;Mandy,&quot; &quot;Tryinâ to Get the Feeling Again&quot; by David Pomerantz, &quot;[[Weekend in New England]]&quot; (by [[Randy Edelman]]), &quot;[[Looks Like We Made It]]&quot; by Richard Kerr and Will Jennings, &quot;[[Can't Smile Without You]]&quot; and &quot;Ready to Take a Chance Again.&quot; Ironically, another one of his hits that Manilow did not write or compose himself was his number&amp;nbsp;1 &quot;[[I Write The Songs]]&quot; (by [[Bruce Johnston]] of [[The Beach Boys]]). According to album liner notes, Manilow did, however, co-produce them with [[Ron Dante]] and [[arrangement|arrange]] them.

Manilow's breakthrough in Britain came with the release of &quot;Even Now,&quot; the first of many top 20 albums on that side of the [[Atlantic]]. This was quickly followed by ''Manilow Magic â The Best Of Barry Manilow,'' also known as ''[[Greatest Hits (Barry Manilow album)|Greatest Hits]].'' On its initial release it was marketed with a large television campaign by the mail order label &quot;Teledisc.&quot; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired four variety [[television special]]s starring and executive produced by Manilow. ''The Barry Manilow Special'' with [[Penny Marshall]] as his guest premiered on March 2, 1977 to an audience of 37 million. The breakthrough special was nominated for four Emmys and won in the category of &quot;Outstanding Comedy-Variety or Music Special.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.org&quot;&gt;Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, [http://www.emmys.org/awards/2006pt/history.php].

On May 23, 1979, ABC aired ''The Third Barry Manilow Special,'' with [[John Denver]] as his guest. This special was nominated for two Emmy awards and won for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Choreography.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.org&quot; /&gt; Also in 1979, Manilow produced Dionne Warwick's &quot;comeback&quot; album ''[[Dionne (1979 album)|Dionne]],'' her first to go platinum.

===1980s===
The 1980s gave Manilow the adult contemporary chart-topping songs &quot;The Old Songs&quot;, &quot;Somewhere Down the Road&quot;, &quot;Read 'Em and Weep&quot; (a [[Meat Loaf]] cover, written by [[Jim Steinman]]) and a remake of the 1941 [[Jule Styne]] and [[Frank Loesser]] standard &quot;[[I Don't Want to Walk Without You]].&quot; Manilow continued having high radio airplay throughout the decade. In the UK, Manilow had five sold-out performances at [[Royal Albert Hall]]. In the United States, at [[Radio City Music Hall]] (1984) his 10-night run set a box-office sales record of nearly $2 million, making him the top draw in the then 52-year history of the venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED6178C63C46C20&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM People], ''The Dallas Morning News'', November 3, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Manilow's ''One Voice'' special, with Dionne Warwick as his guest, was nominated for an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Music Direction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.org&quot; /&gt;

Also in 1980, a concert from Manilow's sold-out shows at England's [[Wembley Arena]] was broadcast while he was on a world tour. Manilow released the self-titled ''[[Barry (album)|Barry]]'' (1980), which was his first album to not reach the top ten in the United States, stopping at #15. The album contained &quot;I Made It Through The Rain&quot; (originally a minor hit for its writer, [[Gerard Kenny]]) and &quot;Bermuda Triangle.&quot; The album ''[[If I Should Love Again]]'' followed in 1981, containing &quot;The Old Songs,&quot; &quot;Let's Hang On,&quot; and &quot;Somewhere Down The Road.&quot; This was the first of his own albums that Manilow produced without Ron Dante, who had co-produced all the previous albums. Manilow's sold-out concert at the [[Mellon Arena|Pittsburgh Civic Arena]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] aired nationally on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], and locally on [[Philadelphia]]'s now-defunct [[Prism (TV channel)|PRISM]]. In 1982, a concert from his sold out [[Royal Albert Hall]] show was broadcast in England. The live album and video ''[[Barry Live in Britain]]'' also came from his Royal Albert Hall shows.

On August 27, 1983, Manilow performed a landmark open air concert at [[Blenheim Palace]] in Britain. It was the first such event ever held at that venue and was attended by a conservative estimate of 40,000 people. This concert was also taped for airing on Showtime. In December 1983, Manilow was reported to have endowed the music departments at six major universities in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB296BB4BAE61D7&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Newsmakers], ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', December 1, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The endowments were part of a continuing endeavor by Manilow to recognize and encourage new musical talent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newspaperarchive.com/LandingPage.aspx?type=glp&amp;search=manilow%20canada&amp;img=\\na0034\6769112\28125634.html Peopletalk], ''The Valley Independent'', December 1, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Manilow released ''[[2:00 AM Paradise Cafe]],'' a [[jazz]]/[[blues]] collection of original barroom tunes recorded in one live take in the studio. That same year, Showtime aired a documentary of Manilow recording the album with a number of jazz legends, such as [[Sarah Vaughn]] and [[Mel TormÃ©]]. In 1984 and 1985, England aired two one-hour concert specials from his [[National Exhibition Centre]] (NEC) concerts. In 1985, Manilow left Arista Records for RCA Records. There he released the pop album ''[[Manilow (album)|Manilow]]'', and began a phase of international music, as he performed songs and duets in French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese, among other languages. The ''Manilow'' album was a complete about face from the ''Paradise Cafe'' album, containing a number of tracks of a modern uptempo and synthesized quality. In 1985, Japan aired a Manilow concert special where he played &quot;[[Sakura (folk song)|Sakura]]&quot; on the [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]].

In his only lead acting role, he portrayed Tony Starr in a 1985 CBS film based on ''[[Copacabana (musical)|Copacabana]]'', alongside [[Annette O'Toole]] as Lola Lamarr and [[Joseph Bologna]] as Rico. Manilow penned all the songs for the movie, with lyrics provided by established collaborators Bruce Sussman and Jack Feldman, and released ''[[Copacabana: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Album]]'' on RCA Records. In October 1986, Manilow, along with Bruce Sussman, Tom Scott, and [[Charles Fox (composer)|Charlie Fox]], went to Washington, D.C. for two days of meetings with legislators, including lunch with then Senator [[Al Gore]] (D-TN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_v18/ai_4539828/pg_4 The longest shot; measuring Al Gore Jr. for the White House â Albert Gore Jr], ''Washington Monthly'', November 1986&lt;/ref&gt; They were there to lobby against a copyright bill put forward by local television broadcasters that would mandate songwriter-producer source licensing of theme and [[incidental music]] on syndicated television show reruns and would disallow use of the blanket license now in effect. The songwriters said without the blanket license, artists would have to negotiate up front with producers individually, without knowing if a series would be a success. The license now pays according to a per-use formula. Manilow said that such a bill would act as a precedent for broadcasters to get rid of the blanket license entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phillipsphiles.blogspot.com/2008/05/scooter-talk-blog-manilow-flashback_3679.html Manilow: Bill Would Spell Disaster â Star Reacts To Source Licensing Moves], ''Billboard'', October 11, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, [[McGraw-Hill]] published his autobiography, ''Sweet Life: Adventures on the Way to Paradise'', which had taken him about three years to complete. While promoting the work, Manilow defended his music in a telephone interview: &quot;I live in laid-back L.A., but in my heart, I'm an energetic New Yorker and that's what has always come out of my music.

In March 1988, CBS aired Manilow's ''Big Fun on Swing Street'' special. It featured songs and special guests from his ''Swing Street'' and ''2:00&amp;nbsp;AM Paradise Cafe'' albums, including Kid Creole and the Coconuts, [[Phyllis Hyman]], [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Carmen McRae]], [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], and Uncle Festive, a band within Manilow's band at the time.

In 1988, he performed &quot;Please Don't Be Scared&quot; and &quot;Mandy/Could It Be Magic&quot; at ''[[That's What Friends Are For]]: AIDS Concert '88'', a benefit concert for the Warwick Foundation headed by Dionne Warwick and shown on Showtime a few years later.

From April 18 to June 10, 1989, Manilow put on a show called ''Barry Manilow at the Gershwin'', making 44 appearances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4541 |title=Internet Broadway Database |publisher=Ibdb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] (also known as the Uris Theatre), where, by coincidence, he recorded ''Barry Manilow Live'' in 1976. A best-selling 90-minute video of the same show was released the following year as ''Barry Manilow Live On Broadway''. The Showtime one-hour special ''Barry Manilow SRO on Broadway'' consisted of edited highlights from this video. Manilow followed this set of shows with a world tour of the Broadway show.

In the 1990s, Manilow released a number of cover tunes. It started with the 1989 release ''Barry Manilow'', continued with his 1990 Christmas LP ''[[Because It's Christmas]]''. Consequent &quot;event&quot; albums followed including: ''[[Showstoppers]]'', a collection of Broadway songs (1991), ''[[Singin' with the Big Bands]]'' (1994) and a late 1970s collection ''[[Summer of '78]]'' (1996) which included the hit &quot;I Go Crazy&quot;, formerly a hit for Paul Davis in 1978. The decade ended with Manilow recording a tribute to Frank Sinatra ''[[Manilow Sings Sinatra]]'' (1998) released months after Sinatra's death. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In 1990, Japan aired ''[[National (brand)|National]] Eolia Special: Barry Manilow On Broadway'' where he sang the title song &quot;Eolia&quot;, which was used as a song there in a commercial for an air conditioner company of the same name, as well as other songs from his 1989â1990 ''Live on Broadway'' tour. In the early 1990s, Manilow signed on with [[Don Bluth]] to compose the songs with lyricists [[Jack Feldman (lyricist)|Jack Feldman]] and Bruce Sussman for three animated films. He co-wrote the Broadway-style musical scores for ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'' (1995). The third film, entitled ''Rapunzel'', was [[shelved]] after the poor performance of ''The Pebble and the Penguin''. Manilow was also to be cast as the voice of a cricket. Manilow also composed the score and wrote two songs with Bruce Sussman for ''[[Disney Sing Along Songs#Let's Go to the Circus (April 19, 1994)|Disney Sing Along Songs: Let's Go To The Circus]]''.

On February 19, 1992, Manilow testified before the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration House Committee in support of H.R. 3204 ''The [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1991''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phillipsphiles.blogspot.com/2008/05/scooter-talk-blog-manilow-flashback_1734.html House Testimony for Home Recording Act], February 19, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was signed into law on October 28, 1992 by President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The Act, a historic compromise between the consumer electronics and music industries, became effective immediately. In 1993, [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] aired, as a fundraiser, ''Barry Manilow: The Best of Me'', which was taped at Wembley Arena in England earlier that same year. The BBC also played a one-hour version of the same show including &quot;The Best of Me&quot;, sung during the concert, as a bonus song or &quot;lucky strike extra&quot; as Manilow says, not seen in ''The Greatest Hits...and then some'', the video release of the show; however, the song was included on the DVD of the same title, with Manilow seated in front of a black curtain, lip-syncing to the recording. Manilow branched out in another direction and, with long-time lyricist Bruce Sussman, launched ''[[Copacabana (musical)|Copacabana]]'', a musical play based on previous Manilow-related adaptations. They wrote new songs and it ran for two years on the London West End, and a tour company formed. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

In December 1996, [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] aired ''Barry Manilow: Live By Request'', the first of his two ''[[Live By Request]]'' appearances. The broadcast was A&amp;E's most successful music program, attracting an estimated 2.4 million viewers. The show was also simulcast on the radio. In March 1997, [[VH-1]] aired ''Barry Manilow: The Summer of '78'', a one-hour special of Manilow solo at the piano being interviewed and playing his greatest hits as well as songs from ''[[Summer of '78]]'' his latest release at the time. In another collaboration between Manilow and Sussman they co-wrote the musical ''Harmony'', which previewed October 7 to November 23, 1997 at the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in  [[La Jolla, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lajollaplayhouse.com/history/1997.htm La Jolla Playhouse HARMONY â 1997], accessed December 20, 2006 {{Wayback | url=http://www.lajollaplayhouse.com/history/1997.htm  | date=20061026171757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2003, ''[[Harmony]]'' was originally scheduled for a tryout run in Philadelphia  before going to Broadway, but was canceled after financial difficulties. After a legal battle with Mark Schwartz, the show's producer, Manilow and Sussman in 2005 won back the rights to the musical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.excite.com/celebgossip/pgsixceleb/id/07_22_2005_2.html DIS-'HARMONY'], ''New York Post'', July 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
In the year 2000, Manilow had two specials, ''Manilow Country'' and ''Manilow Live!'', taped over two consecutive days at the [[Tennessee Performing Arts Center]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee. On April 11, 2000, [[The Nashville Network]] (TNN) aired the two-hour ''Manilow Country'', which featured country stars [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Neal McCoy]], [[Deana Carter]], [[Jo Dee Messina]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Kevin Sharp (country music)|Kevin Sharp]], [[Lila McCann]], [[Gillian Welch]] and [[Jaci Velasquez]] singing their favorite Manilow hits with a &quot;[[Country music|country]]&quot; twist; Manilow also performed. This &quot;special&quot; was TNN's first High Definition (HD) broadcast and became one of TNN's highest rated concert specials.

In June 2000, [[DirectTV]] aired the two-hour concert special ''Manilow Live!'' where Manilow had his band, a 30-piece orchestra, and a choir. This [[HDTV]] special documented the concert tour at the time with the greatest hits of his career and was also released to video. Also that year, he worked with Monica Mancini on her Concord album ''The Dreams of Johnny Mercer'' which included seven songs Manilow wrote to Mercer's lyrics. Meanwhile, Manilow's record contract with Arista Records was not renewed due to new management. He then got a contract at [[Concord Records]], a jazz-oriented label in California, and started work on the long-anticipated concept album, ''[[Here at the Mayflower]]''. The album was another eclectic mix of styles, almost entirely composed and produced by Manilow himself.

While Manilow was at Concord Records, the Barry Manilow Scholarship was awarded for four consecutive years from 2002 to 2005 to the six highest-achieving students to reward excellence in the art and craft of lyric writing. The UCLA Extension course &quot;Writing Lyrics That Succeed and Endure,&quot; taught by long time Manilow collaborator, Marty Panzer, and each student received three additional &quot;master class&quot; advanced sessions as well as a three-hour private, one-on-one session with Mr. Panzer. Scholarship recipients were selected by the instructor based on progress made within the course, lyric writing ability, and the instructor's assessment of real potential in the field of songwriting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/234250 Lyricists Compete for Barry Manilow Scholarship at UCLA Extension], ''Broadcast Music, Inc (BMI)''&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002, Manilow returned to the charts when [[Arista Records|Arista]] released a greatest hits album, ''[[Ultimate Manilow]]''. On May 18, 2002, Manilow returned to CBS with ''Ultimate Manilow'', his first special at the network since his ''Big Fun on Swing Street'' special in 1988. The special was filmed in the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], California and was nominated for an Emmy in the category of &quot;Outstanding Music Direction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;

Produced by Manilow, ''[[Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook]]'' was first released on September 30, 2003. It was the first time that [[Bette Midler]] had worked with Barry in more than twenty years. Instantly successful, the album went gold and they worked together again on a 2005 follow-up album entitled ''[[Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook]]''. On December 3, 2003, A&amp;E aired ''A Barry Manilow Christmas: Live by Request'', his second of two concerts for the series. The two-hour special had Manilow taking requests for Christmas songs performed live with a band and an orchestra. Manilow told the audience that he was what Clay Aiken was going to look like in thirty years, thus acknowledging an ongoing comparison between the two. Also on the special were guests [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Jose Feliciano]], and Bette Midler (Midler, busy preparing her own tour in LA, appeared only in a pre-taped segment).

2004 brought the release of two albums.  These were, consecutively, a live album, ''[[2 Nights Live!]]'' (BMG Strategic Marketing Group, 2004), and ''[[Scores (album)|Scores: Songs from Copacabana &amp; Harmony]]'', an album of Manilow singing songs from his musicals. ''Scores'' was the last of Manilow's creative projects with the Concord label.

During his third appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on September 15, 2004, Winfrey announced that Manilow is one of the most requested guests of all time on her show. On the show he promoted his ''One Night Live! One Last Time!'' tour.

Manilow also appeared on [[Clay Aiken]]'s TV special, ''[[A Clay Aiken Christmas]]''.

Manilow returned to Arista Records under Davis for a new covers album, released January 31, 2006, called ''The Greatest Songs of the Fifties''. Manilow said he was blown away with the idea, which Davis presented to him when he visited his Las Vegas show. &quot;When he suggested this idea to me, I slapped my forehead and said, 'Why hasn't anyone thought of this idea?'&quot; Manilow said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etonline.com/music/35975/ Barry Manilow Croons For ET], ''Entertainment Tonight'', January 27, 2006  {{Wayback|url=http://www.etonline.com/music/35975/|date =20071013195504}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an unexpected success, debuting at number one in the [[Billboard 200]], marking the first time a Manilow album debuted at the top of the album chart as well as the first time a Manilow album has reached number one in 29 years. It was eventually certified Platinum in the U.S., and sold over 3 million copies worldwide.

When the symptoms of extreme pain and discomfort did not go away following preliminary treatment, an MRI arthogram was performed and the labrum tears were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/08-06-2006/0004410921&amp;EDATE |title=Singer Barry Manilow to Have Hip Surgery |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manilow's first appearance back from the surgery took place at a concert in Atlantic City, with Barry springing forth from a golden wheelchair and holding his 2006 Emmy for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.

==In media==
In 1989, Manilow told ''[[Us Weekly|Us Magazine]]'' he was hoping for a dinner invitation from his new [[Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel-Air]] neighbors, [[Ronald Reagan|Ronald]] and [[Nancy Reagan]], but complained they cramp his style of [[Sunlight#Sunbathing|sunbathing]] in the [[nudity|nude]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7302D3584078F&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM REAGANS CRAMP MANILOW'S STYLE], ''San Jose Mercury News'', June 9, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I thought it was pretty hot, but there is [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] all over the place.

In 1989 an American tabloid claimed he was engaged to porn star [[Robin Byrd]]. On a June 22, 1989 appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', Manilow was asked by Carson about the headline story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johnnycarson.com/carson/search.do?singleDateMonth=06&amp;singleDateDay=22&amp;singleDateYear=1989 Johnny Carson | The King of Late Night] The Official Tonight Show Website: Guest Search 6/22/89&lt;/ref&gt; He disputed the story telling Carson he is just friends with Byrd and an innocent picture was taken and that there is no truth to them being engaged. After he met Byrd, his band gave him a videotape of ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' as a present for his birthday. Manilow added to Carson that he can't watch his friend doing that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robinbyrdweb.tripod.com/ib_bm.htm |title=Robin Byrd with Barry Manilow |publisher=Robinbyrdweb.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help with the aftermath of [[Hurricane Hugo]] in 1989 which affected the [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], South Carolina, area, Manilow held a benefit concert November 12, 1989 at the University of South Carolina's [[Carolina Coliseum]] in Columbia, where the $10 tickets sold out in three hours, and asked concertgoers to bring canned food to be donated to residents in disaster areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CO&amp;s_site=charlotte&amp;p_multi=CO&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB6C535A4D2188D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM BARRY MANILOW CONCERT SCHEDULED BENEFIT PERFORMANCE TO RAISE MONEY FOR HURRICANE RELIEF EFFORT], ''The Charlotte Observor'', October 9, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Before his concert, Mayor T.

On February 27, 1992, Manilow was the [[Master of Ceremonies]] for friend [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s 60th birthday bash at [[Epcot|Disneyland]] in Anaheim, California and sang &quot;I Made It Through the Rain&quot; to Taylor who was accompanied by her eighth husband, [[Larry Fortensky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&amp;p_theme=rm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4D9E938402DDA&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM TAYLOR CELEBRATES 60TH AT MICKEY MOUSE PARTY], ''Associated Press'', February 29, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 1994, 3 hours before showtime Manilow canceled a performance at an Ethnic Pride and Heritage Festival hosted at the [[Atlantic City Convention Center|Convention Center]] in [[Atlantic City]], NJ. Benefactors included the Community Foundation of New Jersey as well as United Hospitals Medical Center Foundation and [[Newark Museum]] in Newark during the pre-inaugural activities for then [[New Jersey]] Governor-elect [[Christine Todd Whitman|Christie Whitman]]. Manilow said in a statement that he was specifically told in writing the concert would be part of a non-partisan event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=  |last= |pages= |title=Manilow Passes On Gala |date=January 17, 1994 |work=[[Palm Beach Post]]

Manilow, on February 8, 1994, sued Los Angeles radio station [[KBIG-FM|KBIG (104.3 FM)]], seeking $13 million in damages and $15 million in punitive damages because their ad was causing irreparable damage to his professional reputation. The ad, a 30-second spot introduced that January 31, suggested that people listen to KBIG because it does not play Manilow's music. The lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior Court by Manilow's attorney C. Tucker Cheadle of Hastings, Clayton &amp; Tucker in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Jonathan |last= Volzke |title= DON'T PLAY BARRY?

On February 20, 1996, just after noon, Manilow wrecked his 1993 [[Range Rover]] in a four-vehicle crash on a rain-slick interstate in Los Angeles while heading to his Bel-Air home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB71F60874C20DF&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM SINGER UNHURT AFTER FOUR-CAR CRASH IN RAIN], ''San Jose Mercury News'', February 22, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; No one was injured in the accident. Manilow, who wasn't hurt, stood on the shoulder of [[Interstate 5]] signing autographs and posing for snapshots until an aide showed up and took him home, his spokeswoman Susan Dubow said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OC&amp;p_theme=oc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF407709E43409&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Barry Manilow bends a fender, `The Mousetrap' keeps its spring, and Dorothy Hamill is sued...], ''The Orange County Register'', February 21, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1996, it was reported that Manilow sold his gated, {{convert|2|acre|m2|sing=on}} Bel-Air home of 17 years with a recording studio for close to its $2.45 million asking price and was looking to buy another residence in the Los Angeles area. He had multiple offers on the 1950s home of {{convert|3700|sqft|m2}} with many pathways, a long driveway and city views. It finally went to a local television producer. The nearby [[Hotel Bel-Air]] supposedly regularly provided Manilow with room service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&amp;p_theme=kc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAF4391C0C47012&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Stargazing], ''The Kansas City Star'', October 9, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arizona Court of Appeals]] Judge Philip Espinosa, in another notable headline story, sued Manilow over the volume of a December 23, 1993 concert he attended with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |pages= |title= People, Places &amp; Things in the News: Barry Manilow    - |date=March 29, 1997 |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.s-t.com/daily/03-97/03-29-97/zzzwnppl.htm#XINDEX3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge said in a lawsuit he has had a constant ringing in his ears and nearly blew his ears out. Espinosa sought unspecified damages, and the trial was set for September 23, 1997. The suit also names Manilow's production company, an Arizona concert promoter and the city of [[Tucson]], which runs the [[Tucson Convention Center|convention center]] where the concert was held. In July 1997, to settle the suit it was reported that Manilow donated $5,000 to American Tinnitus Association, an ear-disorder association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |pages= |title= Small Victory Against Loud Music    - |date=July 12, 1997 |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.quiet.org/readings/bites.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, Manilow visited [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/08/1019441520989.html Manilow has a nose for success], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', May 9, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

To help in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, for every US dollar donated by his fans to the [[American Red Cross]] through the Manilow Fund for Health and Hope website, Manilow personally matched, and the fund itself also matched, tripling the original donation. The fund delivered $150,000 in less than 48 hours to the American Red Cross, and hoped to raise a grand total of $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/09-03-2005/0004099775&amp;EDATE= Manilow Fund Set To Triple Aid For Hurricane Katrina Relief], ''PRNewswire'', September 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/b/2005/09/03/barry-manilow-and-manilow-fund-matching-donations-for-hurricane-katrina-relief.htm |title=Barry Manilow and Manilow Fund Matching Donations For Hurricane Katrina Relief |publisher=Top40.about.com |date=2005-09-03 |accessdate=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 2005 Manilow appeared on ''Larry King Live'' whereby the host alluded to the star's hushed social life.
