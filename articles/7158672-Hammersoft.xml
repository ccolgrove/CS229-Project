From 1996-1998, Bradley competed in [[pair skating]] with [[Tiffany Vise]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =Crystal Report Viewer | work =ISU.org | url=http://www.isufs.org/bios/isufs00003278.htm | accessdate =2007-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They competed twice at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]]. In 2001, he reached Sectionals with Melissa Gallegos.&lt;ref name=tradition/&gt; Bradley decided not to continue with pairs, preferring to focus on his singles career and not having enough time to train in both.&lt;ref name=tradition/&gt;

As a single skater, he won the silver medal on the Intermediate level at the Junior Olympics (later renamed ''Junior Nationals'') in the 1994-1995 season. The 1995-1996 season was Bradley's first on the Novice level, and he did not make it out of Sectionals. In the 1996-1997 season, he placed 7th at the novice level at Nationals. In the 1997-1998 season, Bradley won the silver medal on the novice level at Nationals. This win earned him a trip to the [[Triglav Trophy]], which he won.

The following season, 1998â1999, Bradley debuted on the [[1998â1999 ISU Junior Grand Prix|ISU Junior Grand Prix]]. He won medals at both his events. At that time, the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]] were held before the U.S. Championships. At the Junior Worlds selection competition, Bradley placed second and was placed on the team for the [[1999 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|1999 Junior Worlds]], where he placed 10th. At the [[1999 United States Figure Skating Championships|1999 U.S. Championships]], he won the Junior title. He competed at the [[Gardena Spring Trophy]] following Nationals and won the competition.

In the 1999-2000 season, Bradley remained on the [[1999â2000 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix]] circuit. He won two more medals and qualified for the Junior Grand Prix Final, where he finished 8th. He went on to place 7th in his senior debut at the [[2000 United States Figure Skating Championships|2000 U.S. Championships]]. He went on to place 5th at the [[2000 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2000 Junior Worlds]].

In the 2000-2001 season, Bradley won both of his [[2000â2001 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix]] events and made his senior international debut at the [[Golden Spin of Zagreb]], which he won. He placed 5th at the Junior Grand Prix Final. He placed 9th at the [[2001 United States Figure Skating Championships|2001 U.S. Championships]]. He was originally placed on the team for the [[2001 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2001 Junior Worlds]]. However, he was forced to withdraw prior to the event with injury. He had surgery to repair damage to his landing knee.&lt;ref name =st070326/&gt; His vacated spot was given to [[Evan Lysacek]].

In the 2001-2002 season, [[U.S. Figure Skating]] did not allow American skaters to compete on the [[2001â2002 ISU Junior Grand Prix|Junior Grand Prix]] because of security concerns following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Bradley placed 7th at the [[2002 United States Figure Skating Championships|2002 U.S. Championships]]. He went on to the [[2002 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2002 Junior Worlds]] and placed 15th.

In the 2002-2003 season, Bradley competed at the Karl Schafer Memorial, placing 4th. He made his Grand Prix debut at the [[2003 Skate Canada International]], where he placed 6th. He was 9th at the [[2003 United States Figure Skating Championships|2003 U.S. Championships]].

Bradley missed most of the 2004-2005 season after breaking his arm while playing dodge ball; he had a spiral fracture in the humerus of his right arm and was off the ice for six months.&lt;ref name =st070326&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.skatetoday.com/2007/03/26/from-bad-breaks-to-a-breakout-for-bradley/ | title = From Bad Breaks to a Breakout for Bradley | last = Mittan | first = Barry | date = March 26, 2007 | publisher = SkateToday | accessdate = August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He competed in the 2005-2006 season, hoping to contend for a spot to the [[2006 Winter Olympics]]. He placed 8th at the [[2006 United States Figure Skating Championships|2006 U.S. Championships]].

[[Image:Ryan Bradley Backflip - 2006 Skate America.jpg|thumb|right|Bradley performing a backflip in exhibition at the 2006 Skate America]]
In the 2006-2007 season, Bradley was given a host invitation to the [[2006 Skate America]] due to the retirement of skaters who had placed ahead of him at the 2006 Nationals. Bradley placed 8th.

Bradley accidentally cut his shin with his blade three weeks before the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 U.S. Championships]].&lt;ref name =st070326/&gt; At the event, he held 3rd place after the short program. He skated last in the free skate, and won the silver medal, ahead of defending champion [[Johnny Weir]]. Upon learning that he had won the silver, Bradley skated back onto the ice and performed a backflip for the crowd. Bradley went on to the [[2007 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2007 Four Continents]], held at his home rink, the World Arena in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he placed fourth behind training-mate [[Jeremy Abbott]]. During the off-season, he dealt with a torn meniscus in his right knee.&lt;ref name =st070326/&gt; 

In the 2007-2008 season, Bradley competed on the Grand Prix circuit with a 6th place finish at [[2007 Skate America|Skate America]] and a 5th at [[2007 Trophee Eric Bompard|Trophee Eric Bompard]]. He finished 5th at the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]].

At the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 U.S. Championships]] Bradley finished 4th.
