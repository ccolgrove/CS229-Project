'''New York University''' ('''NYU''') is a [[private university|private]], [[nonsectarian]] research university based in [[New York City]]. NYU's main campus is situated in the [[Greenwich Village]] section of [[Manhattan]]. Founded in 1831, NYU is one of the largest private, [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]] institutions of [[higher education]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;schools&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/about.html | title= About NYU | publisher = New York University | accessdate = 2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU is organized into 18 schools, colleges, and institutes,&lt;ref name=&quot;schools&quot;/&gt; located in six centers throughout Manhattan and Downtown [[Brooklyn]], as well as other sites across the globe. NYU operates [[study abroad]] facilities in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Florence]], [[Prague]], [[Madrid]], [[Berlin]], [[Accra]], [[Shanghai]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Tel Aviv]] in addition to the [[Singapore]] campus of the [[Tisch School of the Arts]] and a comprehensive liberal-arts campus in [[Abu Dhabi (city)|Abu Dhabi]] that opened in September 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;abu dhabi&quot;&gt;{{cite web| first = Jane | last = Timm | url=http://nyunews.com/news/2010/09/13/13abudhabi/|title=NYU Abu Dhabi: the story from concept to classroom | date = September 13, 2010 | publisher = nyunews.com | accessdate = 2010-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; NYU plans to open a portal degree granting campus in [[China]] as part of its Global Network University initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2011-01/21/c_13701018.htm | title= NYU to open 1st American campus in Shanghai | publisher = xinhuane news| accessdate = 2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans to open a site in [[Washington, D.C.]] and in [[Sydney]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://as.nyu.edu/page/NYUDC | title= NYU &gt; A&amp;S &gt; NYU-DC Center | publisher = New York University | accessdate = 2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With approximately 12,500 residents, NYU has the seventh-largest university housing system in the U.S. and the largest among private schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;housingranking&quot;/&gt; Some of the first [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] in the country were formed at NYU.&lt;ref name=&quot;psiupsilon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alphaepsilonpi&quot;/&gt;

NYU's sports teams are called the Violets, the colors being the trademarked hue &quot;NYU Violet,&quot; and white. The school [[mascot]] is modeled after a bobcat. Almost all sports teams at NYU participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] and the [[University Athletic Association]]. While NYU has had [[All-America]]n football players, it has not had a varsity [[American football|football]] team since the 1960s.

NYU is regularly ranked as one of the top academic institutions in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;globaluniversitiesranking.org&quot;&gt;http://www.globaluniversitiesranking.org/images/banners/top-100(eng).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;arwu.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arwu.org |title=Academic Ranking of World Universities |publisher=ARWU |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university counts 34 [[Nobel laureates by university affiliation|Nobel Prize winners]], 3 [[Abel Prize|Abel Prize winners]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 2005 Abel Laureate |publisher = Abel Prize | url = http://www.abelprisen.no/en/prisvinnere/2005/index.html | accessdate = 2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 2007 Abel Laureate |publisher = Abel Prize | url = http://www.abelprisen.no/en/prisvinnere/2007/index.html | accessdate = 2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 [[National Medal of Science]] recipients,&lt;ref name=&quot;philanthropy&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = New York University |publisher = The Chronicle of Philanthropy | url = http://philanthropy.com/employer/New-York-University/125/ | accessdate = 2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyu_a&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = NYU Mathematician Varadhan Named Recipient of National Medal of Science |publisher = NYU | url = http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2011/09/27/nyu-mathematician-varadhan-named-recipient-of-national-medal-of-science.html | accessdate = 2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 16 [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners,&lt;ref name=&quot;collegecrunch.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = About New York University| publisher = College Crunch| url = http://www.collegecrunch.org/school-profiles/new-york-university/ | accessdate = 2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 [[Academy Award]] winners,&lt;ref name=&quot;collegecrunch.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU Oscars 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2011/02/28/two-nyu-filmmakers-win-oscars.html |title=Two NYU Filmmakers Win Oscars! |publisher=nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU Emmys 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Tisch Community Claim EmmysÂ®! |publisher = NYU Tisch | url = http://www.tisch.nyu.edu/object/2011_creative-primetime_emmy_winners.html | accessdate = 2011-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emmy Award|Emmy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = NYU Alumni Score Big at the 2007 Emmys | year = 2007 | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | publisher = NYU Today | url = http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/article/787 | accessdate = 2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grammy Award|Grammy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Jazz Studies Professor and Trumpeter Brian Lynch Wins Grammy Award for Album SimpÃ¡tico | year = 2006 | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | publisher = NYU Today | url = http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/article/505 | accessdate = 2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Tisch Wins at the 2004 Tony Awards | year = 2004 | publisher = Tisch School of the Arts | url = http://alumni.tisch.nyu.edu/object/tsoa_tonyawards.html | accessdate = 2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; winners.

==History==
{{Main|History of New York University}}
[[Image:Albert Gallatin 3.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Albert Gallatin]]]]
[[Albert Gallatin]], Secretary of Treasury under [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], declared his intention to establish &quot;in this immense and fast-growing city ... a system of rational and practical education fitting for all and graciously opened to all.&quot; A three-day long &quot;literary and scientific convention&quot; held in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] in 1830 and attended by over 100 delegates debated the terms of a plan for a new university. These New Yorkers believed the city needed a university designed for young men who would be admitted based on merit, not birthright, status or social class. On April 18, 1831, an institution was established, with the support of a group of prominent New York City residents from the city's landed class of merchants, bankers, and traders. Albert Gallatin was elected as the institution's first president. On April 21, 1831, the new institution received its [[charter]] and was incorporated as the University of the City of New York by the [[New York State Legislature]]; older documents often refer to it by that name. The university has been popularly known as New York University since its beginning and was officially renamed New York University in 1896. In 1832, NYU held its first classes in rented rooms of four-story Clinton Hall, situated near [[New York City Hall|City Hall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;archives1&quot;/&gt; In 1835, the [[NYU School of Law|School of Law]], NYU's first professional school, was established. Although the impetus to found a new school was partly a reaction by [[evangelical]] [[Presbyterian]]s to what they perceived as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalianism]] of [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]],&lt;ref name=gotham&gt;{{cite gotham}} pp. 531-532&lt;/ref&gt; NYU was created [[non-denominational]], unlike many American colonial colleges at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;archives1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last = Friss | first = Evan J. | title = Window into the Past: NYU in Retrospect | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url = http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/thenandnow/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nyuuniheights.jpg|thumb|left|The University Heights campus, now home to the [[Bronx Community College]].]]

Whereas NYU had its [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] campus since its founding, the university purchased a campus at [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] in [[the Bronx]] because of overcrowding on the old campus. NYU also had a desire to follow New York City's development further uptown. NYU's move to the Bronx occurred in 1894, spearheaded by the efforts of Chancellor [[Henry Mitchell MacCracken]].&lt;ref name=&quot;archives1&quot;/&gt; The University Heights campus was far more spacious than its predecessor was. As a result, most of the university's operations along with the undergraduate [[NYU College of Arts and Science|College of Arts and Science]] and School of Engineering were housed there. NYU's administrative operations were moved to the new campus, but the graduate schools of the university remained at Washington Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/heights.htm |title=175 Facts About NYU |publisher=NYU.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Washington Square College was founded as the downtown undergraduate college of NYU. In 1935, NYU opened the &quot;Nassau College-Hofstra Memorial of New York University at Hempstead, Long Island&quot;. This extension would later become a fully independent [[Hofstra University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hofstra.edu/alumni/support/devcc/devcc_growth.html | title = Capital Campaign | publisher = Hofstra University | accessdate = 2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, financial crisis gripped the New York City government and the troubles spread to the city's institutions, including NYU.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyuandvillage&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = NYU and the Village: History | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url =http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/collections/exhibits/bobst/washsq/history/history.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, NYU President [[James McNaughton Hester]] negotiated the sale of the University Heights campus to the [[City University of New York]], which occurred in 1973. After the sale of the Bronx campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. In the 1980s, under the leadership of President [[John Brademas]],&lt;ref&gt;Laura Turegano. &quot;Fundraising Beyond U.S. Borders - NYU: A Success Story&quot;.

===University logo===
The university logo, the upheld torch, is derived from the [[Statue of Liberty]], signifying NYU's service to the city of New York. The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name=&quot;facultyhandbook&quot;/&gt;

===Cultural setting===
Washington Square and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of cultural life in New York City since the early nineteenth century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. Artists of the [[Hudson River School]], the United Statesâ first prominent school of painters, settled around [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]]. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], the first chair of Painting and Sculpture at NYU, and [[Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-nineteenth century. (The University rented out studio space and residential apartments within the &quot;academic&quot; building.) Artists and intellectuals such as [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Walt Whitman]] contributed to the artistic scene near NYU. As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the University.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyuandvillage&quot;/&gt;

In the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyuandvillage&quot;/&gt; Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the University, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyuandvillage&quot;/&gt; In 1975 the University opened The Grey Art Gallery at 100 Washington Square East, housing the New York University art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html Grey Art Gallery art collection] Retrieved March 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/ The Grey Art Gallery] Retrieved March 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
{{Main|Campus of New York University}}
Most of NYU's buildings are located across a roughly 229 acre area bounded by [[Houston Street]] to the south, [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]] to the east, [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] to the north, and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas) to the west. The core of NYU consists of buildings that surround [[Washington Square Park]].

===Washington Square campus===
Since the late 1970s, the central part of NYU has been its Washington Square campus in the heart of [[Greenwich Village]]. The [[Washington Square Arch]] is an unofficial symbol of NYU. Until 2007, NYU had held its commencement ceremonies in Washington Square Park, but moved the ceremonies to [[Yankee Stadium]] in 2008 because of renovations to Washington Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commencement ceremony |publisher=NYU |url=http://www.nyu.edu/commencement/ceremony.html |accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Main buildingNYU.JPG|thumb|The [[Silver Center]] circa 1900]]
In the 1990s, NYU became a &quot;two square&quot; university by building a second community around [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]], in close proximity to Washington Square. NYU's Union Square community primarily consists of the priority residence halls of Carlyle Court, Palladium Residence Hall, Alumni Hall, Coral Tower, Thirteenth Street Hall, University Hall, Third North Residence Hall, and Founders Hall.

NYU operates theaters and performance facilities that are often used by the University's [[music conservatory]] and [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. External productions are also occasionally held in NYU's facilities. The largest performance accommodations at NYU are the [[Skirball Center for Performing Arts]] (850 seats) at 566 LaGuardia Place, just south of Washington Square South; and the Eisner-Lubin Auditorium (560 seats) in the Kimmel Center. Recently, the Skirball Center hosted important speeches on foreign policy by [[John Kerry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Speech at New York University | publisher = GlobalSecurity.org | date = April 20, 2004 | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/iraq/2004/09/iraq-040920-kerry01.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al Gore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Former Vice President Al Gore Remarks to MoveOn.org | publisher = MoveOn.org | date = August 7, 2003 | url = http://www.moveon.org/gore-speech.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the recording of the [[The Apprentice (US season 3)|third season finale of The Apprentice]].

====Bobst Library====
{{Main|Elmer Holmes Bobst Library}}
[[Image:NYU's Bobst library-2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A view of the interior of Bobst]]
The Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, built between 1967 and 1972, is the largest library at NYU and one of the largest academic libraries in the United States. Designed by [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Richard Foster (architect)|Richard Foster]], the 12-story, 425,000-square-foot (39,000 mÂ²) structure sits on the southern edge of Washington Square Park (at 70 Washington Square South) and is the flagship of an eight-library, 4.5 million-volume system. Bobst Library offers one Multidisciplinary Reference Center, a Research Commons, 28 miles of open-stacks shelving, and approximately 2,000 seats for student study. The library is visited by more than 6,800 users each day, and circulates more than one million books annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = About the NYU Libraries | work = | publisher = NYU Libraries | month = June | year = 2007 | url = http://library.nyu.edu/about/about.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobstâs Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media is one of the worldâs largest academic media centers, where students and researchers use more than 95,000 audio and video recordings per year. The Digital Studio offers a constantly evolving, leading-edge resource for faculty and student projects and promotes and supports access to digital resources for teaching, learning, research and arts events.

Bobst Library is also home to significant special collections. The Fales Collection houses one of the finest collections of English and American fiction in the United States, the unique Downtown Collection, documenting the New York literary avante-garde arts scene from the 1970s to the present, and the Food and Cookery Collection, which documents American food history with a focus on New York City. Bobst Library also houses the Tamiment Library, one of the finest collections in the world for scholarly research in labor history, socialism, anarchism, communism, and American radicalism. Tamiment includes the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, the Archives of Irish America, the Center for the Cold War and the U.S., and the Frederic Ewen Academic Freedom Center.

====New facilities====
Since the early 2000s, NYU has developed new facilities on and around its Washington Square Campus. The Kimmel Center for University Life was built in 2003 to serve as the primary location for the university's student services offices. The center also houses the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, the Rosenthal Pavilion, the Eisner &amp; Lubin Auditorium, and the Loeb Student Center. The School of Law built Furman Hall in 2004, incorporating elements of two historic buildings into the new facade, one of which was occupied by poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Albert | last = Amateau | title = N.Y.U. opens new building for law school | newspaper = [[The Villager]] | volume = 73 | issue = 37 | date = January 14â20, 2004 | url = http://www.thevillager.com/villager_37/nyuopensnew.html | accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, NYU announced the development of a new life science facility on [[Waverly Place]]. The facility is the first NYU science building developed since the opening of Meyer Hall in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Lincoln | last = Anderson | title = N.Y.U. to use Waverly buildings for its new life sciences center | newspaper = [[The Villager]] | volume = 74 | issue = 28 | date = November 17â22, 2004 | url = http://www.thevillager.com/villager_81/nyutousewaverly.html | accessdate = 2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2005, NYU announced plans to build a 26-floor, {{convert|190000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} residence hall on 12th Street. The residence hall, named &quot;Founders Hall&quot;, accommodates approximately 700 undergraduates and contains a host of other student facilities.

===Brooklyn campus===
[[File:First Free Congregational Poly jeh.jpg|thumb|Wunsch Building, a former church]] The [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University]], also known as the New York University School of Engineering and Technology, is located in [[Downtown Brooklyn]]. It is one of the oldest private technology institutes in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poly.edu/about/|title=About Poly|publisher=Polytechnic University of NYU|accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a distinguished history in electrical engineering, polymer chemistry, aerospace, and microwave engineering. It is centrally located in the [[MetroTech Center]], and is close to transportation routes and easily accessible from all parts of New York City and Long Island. The institute has state-of-the-art facilities including a brand new library and new facilities for its electrical engineering, computer science and computer engineering programs. The Brooklyn campus offers programs primarily for undergraduate students but also offers opportunities for graduate students, including executive programs for students with related experience.

The Polymer Research Institute was established in 1942 and The [[Microwave Research Institute]] was established in 1945. The American Chemical Society designated the Polymer Research Institute as a National Historic Chemical Landmark on September 3, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acs.org/portal/acs/corg/content?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=PP_ARTICLEMAIN&amp;node_id=930&amp;content_id=CTP_004592&amp;use_sec=true&amp;sec_url_var=region1&amp;__uuid=1cd6888c-c9c1-46e0-8b39-8782953586bd |title=Polymer Research Institute |publisher=Portal.acs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polytechnic Institute played a leadership role in the establishment of the [[MetroTech Center]], one of the largest urban university-corporate parks in the world and the largest in the United States. Today, the 16-acre (65,000 mÂ²), $1 billion complex is home to the institute and several technology-dependent companies, including Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC), New York City Police Department's 911 Center, New York City Fire Department Headquarters and the U.S. technology and operations functions of JPMorgan Chase. In 1998, a Marriott Hotel was built adjacent to MetroTech. MetroTech has proven to be a case study in effective university, corporate, government and private-developer cooperation. It has resulted in renewing an area that once was characterized more by urban decay.

[[File:DibnerLibrary.JPG|thumb|Dibner Library]]Wunsch Building houses the school's student union and is used to host many social, cultural, and academic events for the school and community. The building dates back to 1847 and was the first independent black church in Brooklyn. It was also a stop on the Underground Railroad and has been designated a historic landmark since November 24, 1981.

The Bern Dibner Library of Science and Technology, opened in 1990 in a new building, is Polytechnic's information hub, accessible online from anywhere, on or off campus, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, wireless networks allow users with notebook computers to access the library's electronic services from anywhere on campus.

The Institute also has campuses in downtown Manhattan, Long Island, Westchester, and in international locations such as Israel, Abu Dhabi, Shanghai, and London.

===Other campuses and facilities===
The [[New York University School of Medicine]] is situated near the East River waterfront at 550 First Avenue between East 30th and [[34th Street (Manhattan)|East 34th]] Streets. The campus hosts the medical school, Tisch Hospital, and the [[Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine]]. Other NYU Centers across the city include NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases and the [[Bellevue Hospital Center]]. NYU's Silver School of Social Work (formerly Ehrenkranz School of Social Work) manages branch campus programs in Westchester County at [[Manhattanville College]], in [[Rockland County]] at [[St. Thomas Aquinas College]], and on [[Staten Island]] at the [[City University of New York]]'s [[College of Staten Island]].

In [[Sterling Forest, New York|Sterling Forest]], near Tuxedo, New York, NYU has a research facility that contains institutes, in particular the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine. The Midtown Center at 11 West 42nd Street and the [[Woolworth Building]] in the financial district are home to NYU's continuing education programs.

NYU has two units located on the [[Upper East Side]]. The [[Institute for the Study of the Ancient World]], a discrete entity within New York University, independent of any other school or department of the university, is located on East 84th St, while the [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]], a graduate school of art history and fine arts, is located at the James B. Duke Building at 1 East 78th St.

NYU has a host of foreign facilities used for [[study abroad]] programs. One of the most noteworthy is the {{convert|57|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus of NYU Florence [[Villa LaPietra]] in Italy, bequeathed by the late Sir [[Harold Acton]] to NYU in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = NYU marks years of successful restoration at La Pietra| volume = 16 | issue = 1 | newspaper = NYU Today| date = September 5, 2002 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/archives/16/01/Stories/LaPietra.html | accessdate = 2007-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NYU manages undergraduate academic-year and summer study abroad programs in [[Florence]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[Berlin]], [[Accra]], and [[Madrid]], and recently started programs in [[Shanghai]] and [[Buenos Aires]]. On June 1, 2007, NYU announced plans to develop a campus in [[Israel]] with [[Tel Aviv University]]. The program is scheduled to begin accepting students for the 2008-9 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = NYU Announces Plans to Open Study Abroad Site in Israel | publisher = NYU Office of Public Affairs | date = June 1, 2007 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/releases/detail/1641 | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israel program accepted a small group of students for the spring 2009 semester; however, they were sent to other NYU programs following the [[Gaza War]] for safety reasons. Students were able to participate in the program in the 2009-10 school year. Most recently, the government of the [[United Arab Emirates]] has announced plans to fund a campus abroad for NYU in the capital city of [[Abu Dhabi (city)|Abu Dhabi]], the first of its kind to be established abroad by a major U.S. research university, which is set to receive students by 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;abu dhabi&quot;/&gt; The campus construction (estimated at $1 to $1.5 billion) and operational costs will be entirely funded by the Emirati royal family. 

It was announced in 2011 that NYU has plans to open a third portal campus in [[Shanghai]] for the Fall semester of 2013. It is set to have about 3,000 undergraduate students, the majority of which will be [[Chinese people|Chinese]]. It was approved by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]] in Jan 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = China's Education Ministry Approves NYU Portal Campus in Shanghai | publisher = NYU Local | date = January 21, 2011 | url = http://nyulocal.com/on-campus/2011/01/21/chinas-education-ministry-approves-nyu-portal-campus-in-shanghai/ | accessdate = 2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU also has international houses on campus, including the Deutsches Haus, [[La Maison FranÃ§aise]], the Glucksman Ireland House, Casa Italiana, the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, the Hagop Kevorkian Center, an Africa House and a China House.

NYU was the founding member of the [[League of World Universities]].

===Sustainability===
New York University has made the greening of its campus a large priority. For example, NYU has been the largest university purchaser of wind energy in the U.S. since 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU&quot; &gt;Sustainability&gt;About Sustainability&gt;Fast Facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web

With 12,500 residents, NYU has the seventh-largest university housing system in the U.S. and the largest among private schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;housingranking&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Top Ten Residence Hall Systems | publisher = [[University of Michigan]] Housing | url = http://www.housing.umich.edu/general/topten.html | accessdate = 2007-07-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070305034155/http://www.housing.umich.edu/general/topten.html |archivedate = March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; NYU's undergraduate housing system consists of 21 buildings. Uniquely, many of NYU's residence halls are converted [[apartment]] complexes or old hotels. In general, NYU residence halls receive favorable ratings, and some are opulent. Many rooms are spacious and contain amenities considered rare for individual college residence hall rooms, such as kitchens and living rooms/common areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Turley | first = Meredith | title = New York University: Off the Record | publisher = [[College Prowler]] | date = July 1, 2006 | isbn = 978-1427401021 | page = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university operates its own transit system to transport its students by [[bus]] to its campus.

Undergraduate students are guaranteed housing during their enrollment at NYU. Most freshman residence halls are in the Washington Square area. While nearly all of the residence halls that primarily house sophomores are in the [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] area, two former residence halls were located in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] and one is still in use in [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]]. All of NYU's residence halls are governed by the [[Residence hall association|Inter-Residence Hall Council]] (IRHC), an umbrella student council organization.

In 2007, the [[National Association of College and University Residence Halls]] named NYU the National School of the Year for IRHC and [[NRHH]]'s strong efforts over the past year. In addition, NYU was named the National Program of the Year for UltraViolet Live, the annual inter-hall competition that raises funds for [[Relay For Life]].

===Admissions and enrollment===
NYU has a large, diverse student population representing all 50 states and more than 130 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = About NYU | work = | publisher = New York University Office of Institutional Research and Program Evaluation | url = http://www.nyu.edu/about/facts.html | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 25â30% of NYU's incoming freshmen are from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, while the remaining 70â75% are from outside the [[Tri-State Region|Tri-State Area]]. Ten percent of the students are from one of New York City's [[the five boroughs|five boroughs]] and 20% are from the surrounding tri-state area. NYU's main [[feeder schools]] reflect a heavy Northeastern U.S. presence, and particularly a strong New York City influence. Among NYU's top feeder schools are prestigious high schools including [[Stuyvesant High School]], [[Brooklyn Technical High School]], [[Bronx High School of Science]], and several top private schools in the northeast.

Out of the 42,242 applicants for the undergraduate class of 2015, around 30% were offered admission (when including admission statistics for the Liberal Studies Program). Out of the acceptances, 38% consisted of [[early decision]] applicants, who together form 23% of the undergraduate class. 4,650 new freshmen are set to begin studies at NYU in Fall 2011. In 2008, NYU achieved a record low admission rate of 24% of applicants.&lt;ref name=&quot;just the facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Just The Facts| publisher = New York University| url = http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/is-nyu-right-for-you/faqs.html| accessdate = 2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Admission rate drops to 24%, lowest in years| work=[[Washington Square News]]|date = April 2, 2008|url=http://www.nyunews.com/2008/04/02/11/|accessdate=October 12, 2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Admission to NYU is extremely selective. The middle 50% of [[SAT]] scores for the class of 2015 was in the 630-730 range for critical reading, 650-750 for math, and 660-750 for writing, with mean scores falling within the top percentiles. The middle 50% of [[ACT (test)|ACT]] scores for the class of 2015 fell between 29 and 31. The average GPA corresponds with an A-range letter grade, and most incoming students were in the top 10% of their class.&lt;ref name=&quot;just the facts&quot;/&gt;

On June 21, 2010, NYU announced the profile of the first freshman class of NYU Abu Dhabi, which calls itself the &quot;World's Honors College&quot;. The class includes 150 students, 36% of whom are from the United States. The average SAT score was 1470 and the acceptance rate was just 2.1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Redden |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2010-06-21-IHE-NYU-Abu-Dhabi21_ST_N.htm?csp=34news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+usatoday-NewsTopStories+(News+-+Top+Stories) |title=NYU admits first class for its new Abu Dhabi campus |work=USA Today|date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the admissions process, some institutions at NYU are relatively more selective than others in certain categories, depending on the institution's educational goals. For example, NYU's Abu Dhabi program looks primarily for students who have demonstrated a history of leadership in addition to gifted intellectual ability (the average SAT scores of admitted students are 715 for verbal and 730 for math), whereas NYU's Tisch School of the Arts - while still requiring very high SAT/ACT scores - focuses much more on artistic and creative prowess (demonstrable via a portfolio) than do other schools at NYU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = N.Y.U.

==Budget and fundraising==
New York University has successfully completed a seven-year, $2.5 billion campaign, surpassing expectations by raising more than $3 billion over the seven-year period, the highest amount ever raised by any university in a completed campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Masterson | first = Kathryn | year = 2008 | url = http://chronicle.com/news/article/5430/nyu-sets-record-with-31-billion-campaign | title = NYU Sets Record With $3.1-Billion Campaign| accessdate = 2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Started in 2001, this campaign was the university's largest in its history, as they planned to &quot;raise $1 million per day for [[scholarships]] and [[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]], faculty building, new academic initiatives, and enhancing NYU's physical facilities&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;campaignnews&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Beckman | first = John | title = New York University Kick Off $2.5 Billion Fundraising Campaign | publisher = NYU Office Public Affairs | date = April 28, 2004 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/publicaffairs/newsreleases/b_nyu_campaign_09282004.shtml | accessdate = 2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign included a $50 million gift from the Tisch family (after which one building and the [[Tisch School of the Arts|art school]] are named) and a $60 million gift from six [[trustee]]s called &quot;The Partners Fund&quot;, aimed at hiring new faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;campaignnews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;campaign&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = The Campaign for NYU | publisher = NYU Office for University Development &amp; Alumni Relations | url = http://campaign.nyu.edu/ | accessdate = 2007-09-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070822075608/http://campaign.nyu.edu/ |archivedate = August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 15, 2007 the university announced that the Silver family donated $50 million to the [[NYU School of Social Work|School of Social Work]], which will be renamed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = NYU Alumni Constance &amp; Martin Silver Donate $50 Million to University's School of Social Work | publisher = NYU Office Public Affairs | date = October 15, 2007 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/releases/detail/1790 | accessdate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the largest donation ever to a school of social work in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Scott | last = Jaschik | title = Quick Takes | publisher = [[Inside Higher Ed]] | date = October 17, 2007 | url = http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/10/17/qt | accessdate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has announced a 25-year strategic development plan, scheduled to coincide with its [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] in 2031. Included in the &quot;NYU 200&quot; plans are increasing resident and academic space, hiring additional exemplary faculty, and involving the New York City community in a transparent planning process. Additionally, NYU hopes to make their buildings more environmentally friendly, which will be facilitated by an evaluation of all campus spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Portlock | first = Sarah | title = NYU unveils 25-year plan | newspaper = [[Washington Square News]] | date = April 24, 2007 | url = http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/04/24/News/Nyu-Unveils.25Year.Plan-2876454.shtml | accessdate = 2007-09-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070822173414/http://media.www.nyunews.com/media/storage/paper869/news/2007/04/24/News/Nyu-Unveils.25Year.Plan-2876454.shtml |archivedate = August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of this plan, NYU purchased 118 million [[kilowatt-hours]] of [[wind power]] during the 2006-7 academic year â the largest purchase of wind power by any university in the country and any institution in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreenBiz.com&quot;/&gt; For 2007, the university expanded its purchase of wind power to 132 million kilowatt-hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU buys more wind power credit&quot;/&gt; As a result, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] ranked NYU as one of the greenest college in the country in its annual College &amp; University Green Power Challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYU Office of Public Affairs&quot;/&gt;

===Student government===
The [[Student Senators Council]] is [[students' union|governing student body]] at NYU.

[[Image:NYU Thomas SLF235 30620 on Shuttle Route A.jpg|thumb|A bus system transports students to and from the far ends of campus]]
NYU has over 450 student clubs and organizations on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = New York University:Housing &amp; Campus Life | year = 2007 | publisher = [[College Board]] | url = http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=3186&amp;profileId=8 | accessdate = 2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the sports teams, fraternities, sororities, and study clubs, there are many organizations on campus that focus on entertainment, arts, and culture. These organizations include various [[student newspaper|student media]] clubs: for instance, the daily [[student newspaper]] the ''[[Washington Square News]]'', a daily blog [[NYU Local]], comedy magazine ''[[The Plague (magazine)|The Plague]]'', and the literary journals Washington Square Review and The Minetta Review, as well as student-run event producers such as the NYU Program Board and the Inter-Residence Hall Council. It also operates [[radio station]] [[WNYU-FM]] 89.1 with a diverse [[college radio]] format, transmitting to the entire [[New York metropolitan area]] from the original campus, and via booster station WNYU-FM1 which fills in the signal in [[lower Manhattan]] from atop one of the Silver Towers, next to the [[American football field|football field]] at the Washington Square campus.

During the University Heights era, an apparent rift evolved with some organizations distancing themselves from students from the downtown schools. The exclusive [[Philomathean Society at New York University|Philomathean Society]] operated from 1832 to 1888 (formally giving way in 1907 and reconstituted into the Andiron Club). Included among the Andiron's regulations was &quot;Rule No.11: Have no relations save the most casual and informal kind with the downtown schools&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Guide to the Andiron Club of New York City | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url = http://dlib.nyu.edu/eadapp/transform?source=archives/andiron.xml&amp;style=archives/archives.xsl | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Eucleian Society]], rival to the Philomathean Society, was founded in 1832. The Knights of the Lamp was a social organization founded in 1914 at the School of Commerce. This organization met every full moon and had the glowworm as its mascot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = A Window Into the Past: NYU in Retrospect | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url = http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/thenandnow/leisure.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Red Dragon Society]], founded in 1898, is thought to be the most selective society at NYU. In addition, NYU's first yearbook was formed by fraternities and &quot;secret societies&quot; at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 175 Facts About NYU | work = | publisher = New York University Archives | url = http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/test/175/pages/year.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York University has traditions which have persisted across campuses. Since the beginning of the 20th century initiation ceremonies have welcomed incoming NYU freshmen. At the Bronx University Heights Campus, seniors used to grab unsuspecting freshmen, take them to a horse-watering trough, and then dunk them head-first into what was known colloquially as &quot;the fountain of knowledge.&quot; This underground initiation took place until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Friss | first = Evan | title = Chronicles: A Look at NYU's Past | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | newspaper = NYU Today | date = September 13, 2004 | url = http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/archives/18/01/Stories/chronicles-18-01.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today freshmen take part in university-sponsored activities during what is called &quot;Welcome Week.&quot; In addition, throughout the year the university traditionally holds Apple Fest (an apple-themed country fest that began at the University Heights campus), the Violet Ball (a dance in the atrium of Bobst Library), Strawberry Fest (featuring New York City's longest [[Shortcake|Strawberry Shortcake]]), and the semi-annual [[midnight breakfast]] where Student Affairs administrators serve free breakfast to students before [[final examination|finals]].

===Greek life===
[[Fraternities and Sororities|Greek life]] first formed on the NYU campus in 1837 when [[Psi Upsilon]] chartered its Delta Chapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;psiupsilon&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Psi Upsilon History | year = 2006 | publisher = Psi Upsilon Fraternity | url = http://www.psiu.org/fr/history.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070414185849/http://www.psiu.org/fr/history.html |archivedate = April 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first fraternities at NYU were social ones. With their athletic, professional, intellectual, and service activities, later groups sought to attract students who also formed other groups. Since then, Greek letter organizations have proliferated to include 25 social fraternities and sororities. Approximately 7% of NYU students choose to join fraternities or sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = New York University: Campus Life | publisher = US News &amp; World Report | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2007-12-28 | url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drlife_2785_brief.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four governing boards oversee Greek life at the university. The Interfraternity Council (IFC) has jurisdiction over all 14 recognized fraternities on campus. Seven sororities are under the jurisdiction of the Panhellenic Council (PhC); four multicultural sororities maintain membership in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC). All three of the aforementioned boards are managed under the auspices of the Inter-Greek Council.

Greek organizations have historical significance at NYU. [[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]], [[Zeta Psi]], [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Tau Delta Phi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Our History | publisher = Tau Delta Phi Fraternity, Inc. | year = 2007 | url = http://www.taudeltaphifraternity.org/history.php | accessdate = 2008-10-20}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alpha Kappa Psi]] and [[Delta Sigma Pi]] were founded at NYU.

Delta Phi is also oldest continuously active fraternity in the United States, being the only organization in the original Union Triad to remain active since its institute. The NYU Gamma chapter of [[Zeta Beta Tau]] is the oldest active ZBT chapter in the country. The PhC features four national sororities (Î ÎÎ¦, ÎÎ£Î¤, ÎÎ¦Î, and ÎÎÎ¦) and three local sororities (ÎÎ¨Î, ÎÎ¦Î, and ÎÎ¦Î). Notably, the first chapter of [[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]] was founded at NYU in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History and Traditions | publisher = Delta Phi Epsilon International Sorority | url = http://www.dphie.org/general/index.shtml | accessdate = 2007-07-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070628142321/http://www.dphie.org/general/index.shtml |archivedate = June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
{{Main|NYU Violets}}
[[Image:NYUAthleticsLogo.jpg|thumb|NYU Athletic Logo]]
NYU's sports teams are referred to as the [[NYU Violets]], the colors being the trademarked hue &quot;NYU Violet&quot;, and white. Since 1981, the school [[mascot]] has been a bobcat, whose origin can be traced back to the abbreviation then being used by the Bobst Library computerized catalog â short: Bobcat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/athletics/clubs/mascots/history.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612225016/http://www.nyu.edu/athletics/clubs/mascots/history.html|archivedate=2007-06-12 |title=History of the Bobcat |publisher=New York University|date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; NYU's sports teams include men's and women's varsity basketball, cross country, fencing, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gonyuathletics.com/ |title=NYU Athletics |publisher=New York University|date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; With only two exceptions, all of NYU's sports teams participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] and the [[University Athletic Association]]. The exceptions are menâs volleyball, which competes in the Division I Eastern Collegiate Volleyball Association, and the fencing team, which also participates in Division I.

[[Image:NYU Hockey.jpg|thumb|A hockey player during a game]]
While NYU has had [[All-American]] football players, the school has not had a varsity [[American football|football]] team since the 1960s.  Notable football players include Hall of Fame [[Ken Strong]] (1956) and [[Ed Smith (football player)|Ed Smith]] (1934), the model for the [[Heisman Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Heisman Trophy | publisher = CSTV Networks, Inc. and Heisman.com. | year = 2007 | url = http://www.heisman.com/history/heisman-trophy.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940 season, before a football game between NYU and [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]], students protested against the &quot;gentlemen's agreement&quot; to exclude [[African-American|black]] athletes (at [[University of Missouri|Missouri's]] request). The protest against this practice is the first time such protests were recorded to have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Evelyn Witkin Reflects on Cold Spring Harbor's Golden Age | work = | publisher = Exploratorium | url = http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/coldspring/dispatch/witkin.html | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NYU volleyball.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Men's volleyball in Coles Sports Center]]
NYU, within its short history in NCAA Division III, has won two national team championships and many league championships. The basketball program has enjoyed a good deal of success since its return to intercollegiate competition. In 1997, the women's basketball team, led by head coach Janice Quinn, won a national championship over the [[University of WisconsinâEau Claire]] and in 2007 returned to the Final Four. NYU men's basketball and head coach [[Joe Nesci]] appeared in the Division III National Championship game in 1994. In 2006, the Men's cross country team finished 2nd at the NCAA Championship. The following year, led by Jon Phillips, the Men's cross country team won the 2007 NCAA National Cross Country Championship at St. Olaf College in Minnesota.&lt;!-- Cite results: http://www.raceberryjam.com/archives/ncmencc07.html --&gt;

NYU men's and women's swimming teams captured consecutive (2004â2005) [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC) Division III Swimming and Diving Championships. Christian Majdick of the men's track and field team captured the NCAA Division III championship for the triple jump in 2003. Lauren Henkel, one of the most successful athletes in NYU track and field history, and the current assistant coach of the women's track and field team, acquired [[All-American]] status three times for High Jump.
The men's soccer team won its league ECAC championship in the 2005â2006 season.

The Men's Ice Hockey Team participates in the ACHA (DII) and is in the SECHL. NYU's most successful season for their Ice Hockey team came during the 2003-2004 season, in which the team finished second (2nd) in the nation, losing to [[Oakland University]] of Michigan.

The [[National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association]] (NIWFA) was founded by NYU freshmen [[Julia Jones Pugliese|Julia Jones]] and Dorothy Hafner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Organization | publisher = National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association | url = http://www.niwfa.com/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears from older fight songs that [[Rutgers University]] was also NYU's rival at some point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = O'Brien | first = Robert F. | title = School Songs of America's Colleges and Universities: A Directory | publisher = Greenwood Press | date = September 30, 1991 | isbn = 978-0313278907 | page = 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU students also compete in club and intramural sports, including [[Men's Field Lacrosse]], [[crew]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[rugby union]], [[badminton]], [[ice hockey]], [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[Equestrianism|equestrian]], [[martial arts]], [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[triathlon]]. The [[Coles Sports and Recreation Center]] serves as the home base of several of NYU's intercollegiate athletic teams. Many of NYU's varsity teams play their games at various facilities and fields throughout Manhattan because of the scarcity of space for playing fields near campus. In 2002, NYU opened the Palladium Athletic Facility as the second on-campus recreational facility.  In the same year, NYU's intramural dance team won the National Championship title at the National Dance Alliance (NDA)Division III competition in Daytona, Florida.

As the largest private non-profit university in the country, NYU has one of the largest alumni bodies in the world. At the end of 2004, NYU had about 350,000 alumni. Of these, at least 17,000 live abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =New York University Alumni | publisher = NYU Office of Development &amp; Alumni Relations | url = http://www.nyu.edu/alumni/ | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York University Office for Alumni Affairs oversees the various activities, such as class reunions, local NYU Club gatherings, NYU alumni travel, and Career Services. The Alumni club on campus is the Torch Club. Notable graduating classes include 1941, which graduated three later [[Nobel Prize]] laureates ([[Julius Axelrod]], [[Gertrude B. Elion]] and [[Clifford Shull]]), Olympic Gold Medalist [[John Woodruff]], sportscaster [[Howard Cosell]] and sociologist [[Morris Janowitz]]; 1957 included [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning author [[Frank McCourt]]; 1970 included [[Thomas S. Popkewitz]], professor of curriculum theory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; 1974 included author [[Warren Farrell]], Ph.D. ; and 1977 included: former [[Federal Reserve System|Fed]] [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve|Chairman]] [[Alan Greenspan]]; [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner]] [[Mark Everson]]; [[INSEAD]] Dean Gabriel Hawawini; [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]] and [[Tony Award]] winner [[John Patrick Shanley]]; [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL Commissioner|Commissioner]] [[Gary Bettman]]; physicist [[Lewis Earl Little|Lewis E. Little]]; [[NASDAQ]] CEO [[Robert Greifeld]]; [[Ma Ying-jeou]] president of Republic of China (Taiwan); [[Guillermo Endara]] president of Republic of Panama, [[Clive Davis]] music industry executive, and [[Cathy Minehan]], Federal Reserve Chairman Boston.

Since 1885, the most spirited undergraduate class has been awarded &quot;The Bun&quot;. The award consisted of a bun enclosed in a long casket-like enclosure made of silver. The Bun was taken three times: in 1921, 1971, and 1981. The award was last returned in 2002 and currently resides in the [[Silver Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 175 Facts About NYU | work = | publisher = [[New York University Archives]] | url = http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/bun.htm | accessdate = 2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NYU Club in midtown closed its clubhouse in 1989. Alumni can now join the NYU Club, which is in residence at the [[Princeton Club]] across the street.

==In film and literature==
NYU is often portrayed in a variety of television shows, motion pictures, literature, and other media. Fictional NYU students and faculty include [[Cosmo Kramer|Kramer's]] intern Darren in ''[[Seinfeld]]'', who helps him run &quot;Kramerica Industries&quot;; a student reporter in a different episode of Seinfeld who interviews [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry]]; Theo Huxtable ([[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]]) from ''[[The Cosby Show]]'', who graduates from NYU in the series finale; [[Ross Geller]] ([[David Schwimmer]]) from ''[[Friends]]'', who becomes an NYU professor in Season 6; Character Tom Collins from ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', who taught there; Bud Fox ([[Charlie Sheen]]) in the movie ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' (1987); Finch ([[Eddie Kaye Thomas]]) from the ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]'' films; Paul Tannek ([[Jason Biggs]]) in ''[[Loser (film)|Loser]]'' (2000); ; Alex Foreman ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) in ''[[In Good Company (2004 film)|In Good Company]]'' (2005); Jack Campbell ([[Nicolas Cage]]) in ''[[The Family Man]]'' (2000); and Clark Kellogg ([[Matthew Broderick]]) in ''[[The Freshman (1990 film)|The Freshman]]'' (1990). In the film version of ''[[Thumbsucker (film)|Thumbsucker]]'' (2005), the main character, Justin Cobb ([[Lou Taylor Pucci]]), secretly applies and is accepted to NYU. In the musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'', the struggling songwriter Albert Peterson promises his sweetheart Rosie to start studying at NYU and become an English teacher, so that they can marry. The third season of ''[[Gossip Girl]]'' features NYU prominently with characters [[Blair Waldorf]], [[Dan Humphrey]], [[Vanessa Abrams]] and [[Georgina Sparks]] attending their freshman year at the university. By fourth season, Blair Waldorf and Georgina Sparks both left the university, but Dan Humphrey and Vanessa Abrams are still said to be attending.

In addition, the [[Campus of New York University|campus of NYU]] has been the backdrop for pieces of fiction: [[Grace Adler]]'s office in Will &amp; Grace is portrayed in the show as being in the [[Puck Building]], home to NYU's Wagner School; [[Henry James]]' novel ''[[Washington Square (novel)|Washington Square]]'' is set around the NYU area; ''[[Rose of Washington Square]]'' (1939), ''[[13 Washington Square]]'' (1928), ''[[Annie Hall]]'' (1977), ''[[When Harry Met Sally]]'' (1989), ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' (2007), ''[[August Rush]]'' (2007), ''[[Remember Me (2010 film)|Remember Me]]'' (2010), ''[[Step Up 3-D]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' (2010) are centered around the NYU Campus. In [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[Animated film|animated feature]] ''[[Fritz the Cat (film)|Fritz The Cat]]'' (1972), the dormitory that Fritz burns down is clearly supposed to be NYU's Weinstein Hall, located at 5-11 University Place near the northeast corner of [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]]. The [[Warner Brothers|WB]] show ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' was set at the &quot;University of New York&quot;, clearly modeled after NYU; and NYU's old University Heights Campus in the Bronx provided the scenery for ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982), ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1999), ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'' (2001), ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]'' (2002), and ''[[Mona Lisa Smile]]'' (2003). It's also featured in the TV show Californication.
