'''Vodafone Ireland Limited''', part of the [[Vodafone Group]], is the largest [[mobile phone]] company in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in terms of active subscribers, and was previously called '''Eircell'''. The mobile phone system in use is a digital GSM 900 system, and also a third-generation [[UMTS]] system (the first such [[3G]] system in the Republic of Ireland; see [[communications in Ireland]]). The company offers [[email]] in addition to mobile phone products and services. The company's &quot;[[Prepaid mobile phone|pay as you go]]&quot; mobile phone product was previously  called ''Ready to Go'', previously advertised by [[Republica]]'s song of the same name. It is now called ''Prepay''&lt;br&gt;
Vodafone commands a market share of 54% in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vodafone.ie/jobs/life/ Vodafone now holds 54% of the market share in Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

087 is the usual area code for mobile phone numbers serviced by Vodafone. However, following introduction of full number portability by the [[Commission for Communications Regulation]], some subscribers may have 083, 085, 086 or 089 prefixes instead.

As Eircell, the company sponsored the Irish version of the [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]] [[quiz show]] while it ran on [[Radio TelefÃ­s Ãireann|RTÃ]] [[television]].
&lt;br&gt;
==Eircell==
[[Image:Old EIRCELL.PNG|thumb|right|Eircell]]
Eircell commenced operation in 1986 as the Mobile and Broadcast division of [[Telecom Ãireann]]. The [[GSM]] network went live on July 1993. Eircell handled the Irish mobile phone networks defined by the access codes 088 (analogue [[TACS]] system) and 087 (digital [[GSM]] 900 system) from 1984 until its transfer to Vodafone in 2001. Usage of the service remained low until it became a separate subsidiary, ''Eircell Limited'', in 1997.  In October 1997, Eircell introduced the analogue prepaid [[prepaid mobile phone|pay as you go]] system under the ''Ready To Go'' brand, and turned mobile communications in Ireland into a mass-market product. From early 1997 Eircell faced competition from [[Esat Digifone]], then a joint venture between [[Denis O'Brien]]'s Esat Telecom Group plc and [[Telenor]] of Norway. In 2000, Vodafone made an offer for the company to Eircell's parent, [[eircom]] Plc., which saw the company demerge from Eircom plc into a separate plc, Eircell 2000 plc (trading name: Eircell Vodafone), which was then acquired by Vodafone. In 2002, Eircell Vodafone was rebranded as Vodafone Ireland plc.

In 2001, Eircell closed down its original analogue TACS (088) system, and Vodafone Ireland now operates a purely digital (GSM/UMTS) network.

===Eircell Vodafone rebranded to Vodafone Ireland===
[[Image:Eircell-Vodafone.PNG|thumb|right|Eircell Vodafone transitional branding]]
Vodafone saw Eircell undergo a major rebranding exercise on its acquisition by the group. The main rebranding was to associate a shade of deep [[purple]] with the company. When Vodafone rebranded with their trademark shade of [[red]], the tagline used was &quot;''Red is the new purple, Vodafone is the new name for Eircell''&quot;.

Vodafone Ireland introduced UMTS services (branded &quot;Vodafone live! with 3G&quot;) in 2004, launching the first handsets in November. This meant they were ahead of [[O2 Ireland]] and new entrant [[3 Ireland]] in launching third-generation services. Mobile network [[Meteor (mobile network)|Meteor]] is rolling out their own [[3G]]/[[UMTS]] network, having been awarded the last Irish UMTS licence. Initially restricted to contract ('bill pay') customers, Vodafone extended UMTS to pre-pay 'Ready To Go' customers from 2 June 2005.

Vodafone Ireland have also been known as &quot;Eircell-Vodafone&quot; during their dual-branding phase.

==Criticism==
Analysis by the Sunday Independent in January 2006 showed the massive margins being earned by Vodafone and O2 in the country are costing Irish mobile phone users about â¬300m a year. If the mobile phone companies were to cut their Irish margins to the group average, Vodafone customers would see their annual bills falling by an average of â¬80.47 (â¬6.71 a month)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/the-300m-mobile-ripoff-126029.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The European Commission upheld a ruling by the Irish regulatory body, Comreg, that the Irish mobile phone market needed greater competition, and acknowledged that &quot;tacit collusion possibly existed between O2 and Vodafone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/o2-and-vodafone-may-face-huge-fines-279791.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A senior manager at Vodafone Ireland in March 2007 was dismissed following allegations that he defrauded the mobile operator of more than â¬1m. The company added in a statement: &quot;As the matter is subject to legal proceedings, Vodafone cannot comment further.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/vodafone-manager-sacked-after-claims-of-euro1m-fraud-678858.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/vodafone-cash-fraud-probe-by-detectives-679501.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Parents Council criticised mobile phone companies for the lack of information available about filtering. The Sunday Tribune tested access to four separate sites - a pornography site, an Irish escort site, a pro-anorexia site and a prosuicide site - on the mobile phone networks Vodafone, O2, 3 and Meteor. All four networks allowed access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2008/jun/01/porn-site-filters-on-childrens-mobile-phones-are-u/ Tribune.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 it was revealed that Ireland is nearly the most profitable market in the world for multinational mobile operators like Vodafone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revealed-how-mobile-firms-have-shafted-you-1269676.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2009, the Company admitted to overcharging 100,000 of its Irish customers a total of â¬900,000 by incorrectly billing them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/vodafone-to-refund-customers-8364900000-after-error-1703788.html Independent.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, it was revealed that the Irish exchequer is facing a demand from the Company for a substantial corporation tax refund after it agreed that tax paid in Ireland should have been paid in Britain. The Vodafone subsidiary in question had profits of over â¬200 million but just 20 employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sbpost.ie/news/ireland/vodafone-wants-millions-of-euro-in-tax-refund-50979.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Vodafone pleaded guilty to four breaches of the Data Protection Act at the Dublin District Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/national-news/top-telecoms-firms-fined-for-coldcalling-customers-2588990.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perlico==
On 13 November 2007, Vodafone Ireland announced the acquisition of ''Perlico'', a small fixed line phone and broadband services reseller for â¬80m. This is in line with the strategy of other [[Vodafone]] companies across Europe, in buying small fixed-line providers for potential offerings of future converged services.
As a result of the acquisition, Perlico retains their management and separate brand identity, but will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.ie/article/10123425.html  ENN.ie: Vodafone Acquires Perlico]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisition of BT fixed-line broadband and small business customers ==
On 22 July 2009 [[BT Ireland]]  agreed to transfer its consumer voice, broadband data and small business operations in Ireland to Vodafone, leap-frogging the company into a leading role as a fixed-line broadband operator in the country. Under the terms of the deal Vodafone will lease capacity on BT's fixed line network for the services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btireland.ie/mediacentre/pr_2009_08_21_ca.shtml BTireland.ie]&lt;/ref&gt;
