[[Image:aybabtu.png|frame|right|The phrase as it appears in the introduction to ''[[Zero Wing]]''.]]

&quot;'''All your base are belong to us'''&quot; (often shortened to &quot;'''All Your Base'''&quot;, &quot;'''AYBABTU'''&quot;, or simply &quot;'''AYB'''&quot;) is a [[Engrish|broken English]] phrase that became an [[Internet phenomenon]] or [[Internet meme|meme]] in 2000â2002. The text comes from the opening [[cutscene]] of the 1991 [[Europe]]an [[Sega Mega Drive]] version of the [[video game]] ''[[Zero Wing]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot; /&gt; by [[Toaplan]], which was [[Engrish|poorly translated]] from [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

The meme developed from this as the result of a [[GIF animation]] depicting the opening text&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A19147205 |title=All Your Base Are Belong To Us|author=Alex Tufty Ashman|publisher=[[h2g2]]|date=2007-02-13|accessdate=2008-02-04|quote=&quot;The GIF slowly started to spread across the Internet, but it wasn't until 2000 that it properly gained popularity. By the end of the year, altered images of various road signs, cereal packets and other photographs containing the words 'All Your Base Are Belong To Us' had started to appear, and by 2001 the phenomenon was in full swing.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was initially popularized on the [[Something Awful]] message forums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/magazine/16-02/mf_goons?currentPage=2 |title=Mutilated Furries, Flying Phalluses: Put the Blame on Griefers, the Sociopaths of the Virtual World |author=Julian Dibbell |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |page=2 |date=2008-01-18 |accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a phenomenon of [[surrealism|surreal]] [[Photo manipulation|altered images]] depicting the meme in everyday scenes, placement of the text in [[wikt:real world|real world]] locations, and the text and images being set to [[hardcore techno]] music by the band [[The Laziest Men on Mars]]. Other Zero Wing phrases, including &quot;For great justice!&quot; and &quot;Move zig!&quot;, popularized in the same animated GIF and video, also acquired some degree of notoriety and popular re-use within [[internet culture]].

The phrase or some variation of lines from the game has appeared in numerous articles, books, comics, clothing, movies, radio shows, songs, television shows, video games, webcomics, and websites. Notable mentions include:

In late 2000, [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] [[computer programmer]] and part-time [[DJ]] Jeffrey Ray Roberts of the [[Gabber]] band [[The Laziest Men on Mars]] made a techno dance track, &quot;Invasion of the Gabber Robots&quot;, which remixed some of the ''Zero Wing'' video game music by [[Tatsuya Uemura]] with a voiceover phrase &quot;All your base are belong to us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Taylor, Chris|date=2001-02-25 | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,100525,00.html | title=All Your Base Are Belong To Us | accessdate=2007-06-29 | work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2001, [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] provided an early report on the phenomenon, covering it from the Flash animation to its spread through [[e-mail]] and Internet forums to [[T-shirt]]s bearing the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Benner, Jeffrey|date=2001-02-23 | url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2001/02/42009 | title=When Gamer Humor Attacks | accessdate=2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2003, in [[Sturgis, Michigan]], seven people aged 17 to 20 placed signs all over town that read, &quot;All your base are belong to us. You have no chance to survive make your time.&quot; They claimed to be playing an [[April Fool's Day|April Fool's]] joke but most people who saw the signs were unfamiliar with the phrase. Many residents were upset that the signs appeared while the U.S. was at [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war with Iraq]] and police chief Eugene Alli said the signs could be &quot;a borderline terrorist threat depending on what someone interprets it to mean.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Men arrested for âAll Your Baseâ prank|author=Holly Doyle|url=http://www.wwmt.com/news/sturgis-468-security-thought.html|accessdate=2009-07-10|authorlink=Holly Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2004, [[North Carolina State University]] students and members of [[TheWolfWeb]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] exploited a web-based service provided for local schools and businesses to report a weather-related closing to display the phrase within a [[news ticker]] on a live news broadcast on [[News 14 Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Poulsen, Kevin|date=2004-03-05 | work=The Register | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/05/wags_hijack_tv_channels_onscreen/ | title=Wags hijack TV channel's on-screen ticker | accessdate=2006-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2006, the video hosting website [[YouTube]] was taken down temporarily for maintenance. The phrase &quot;ALL YOUR VIDEO ARE BELONG TO US&quot; appeared below the YouTube logo as a placeholder while the site was down. Some users believed the site had been hacked, leading the host to add the message &quot;No, we haven't been hacked. Get a sense of humor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sandoval | first = Greg | date = 2006-06-02 | url = http://news.cnet.com/YouTube-Humor,-not-hack/2100-1026_3-6079314.html | title = YouTube: Our humor, not our hack | publisher = CNET News.com | accessdate = 2006-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
