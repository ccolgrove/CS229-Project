The '''Single UNIX Specification''' ('''SUS''') is the collective name of a family of standards for [[computer]] [[operating system]]s to qualify for the name &quot;[[Unix]]&quot;. The SUS is developed and maintained by the [[Austin Group]], based on earlier work by the [[IEEE]] and [[The Open Group]].

==History==
[[File:SUS History.svg|thumb|250px|right|Chronological hierarchy of relationships of various UNIX API standards that ultimately gave rise to SUSv4. Solid lines indicate direct descent, whereas dashed lines indicate a case where either 1) one standard influenced another 2) one standard was incorporated into another, or 3) one standard deferred to another.]]

===1980s: Motivation===
The SUS emerged from a mid-1980s project to standardize [[operating system]] [[interface (computer science)|interface]]s for software designed for variants of the Unix operating system. The need for standardization arose because enterprises using computers wanted to be able to develop programs that could be used on the computer systems of different manufacturers without reimplementing the programs. Unix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface partly because it was manufacturer-neutral.

===1988: POSIX===
In 1988, these standards became '''IEEE 1003''' (also registered as '''[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 9945'''), or '''[[POSIX]]''', which loosely stands for '''Portable Operating System Interface for uniX'''.

===1990s: Spec 1170===
In the early 1990s, a separate effort known as the Common API Specification or Spec 1170 was initiated by several major vendors, who formed the [[Common Open Software Environment|COSE]] alliance in the wake of the [[Unix wars]].  This specification became more popular because it was available at no cost, whereas the IEEE charged a substantial fee for access to the POSIX specification.

===1997: Single UNIX Specification version 2===
In 1997, the Open Group released the '''Single UNIX Specification Version 2''' [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7990989775/].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
  |url = http://www.unix.org/version2/pr.html
  |title = The Open Group Announces Enhanced Single UNIX Specification
  |accessdate = 2009-07-26
  |date = March 12, 1997
  |publisher = The Open Group
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This specification consisted of:
* the Base Definitions, Issue 5,
* the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 5,
* the Commands and Utilities, Issue 5,
* the Networking Services, Issue 5,
* the X/Open Curses, Issue 4, Version 2,
and was at the core of the UNIX 98 brand [http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/xxm0.htm].

===2001: POSIX:2001, Single UNIX Specification version 3===
Beginning in 1998, a joint [[working group]] known as the [[Austin Group]] began to develop the combined standard that would be known as the '''Single UNIX Specification Version 3''' and as '''POSIX:2001''' (formally: IEEE Std 1003.1-2001). It was released on January 30, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

  |accessdate = 2009-07-26
  |date = January 30, 2002
  |publisher = The Open Group
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard consisted of:
* the Base Definitions, Issue 6,
* the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 6,
* the Commands and Utilities, Issue 6.
and is at the core of the UNIX 03 brand [http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/xym0.htm].

===2004: POSIX:2004===
In 2004, a new edition of the POSIX:2001 standard was released, incorporating two technical corrigenda. It is called '''POSIX:2004''' (formally: IEEE Std 1003.1-2004) [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://www.unix.org/version3/ieee_std.html
  |title = IEEE Std 1003.1, 2004 Edition
  |accessdate = 2009-07-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008: POSIX:2008===
In December 2008, the [[Austin Group]] published a new major revision, known as '''POSIX:2008''' (formally: IEEE Std 1003.1-2008) [http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://www.opengroup.org/bookstore/catalog/c082.htm

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://www.opengroup.org/austin/
  |title = The Austin Common Standards Revision Group
  |accessdate = 2009-07-26
  |publisher = The Open Group
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the core of the Single UNIX Specification, Version 4 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unix.org/version4 Single UNIX Specification Version 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard consists of:
* the Base Definitions, Issue 7,
* the System Interfaces and Headers, Issue 7,
* the Commands and Utilities, Issue 7.

==Specification==
SUSv3 totals some 3700 pages, which are thematically divided into four main parts:

* '''Base Definitions (XBD)''' - a list of definitions and conventions used in the specifications and a list of [[C (programming language)|C]] header files which must be provided by compliant systems. 84 header files in total are provided.
* '''Shell and Utilities (XCU)''' - a list of utilities and a description of the shell, [[Bourne shell|sh]]. 160 utilities in total are specified.
* '''System Interfaces (XSH)''' - contains the specification of various functions which are implemented as [[system call]]s or [[Library (computing)|library]] functions. 1123 system interfaces in total are specified.
* '''Rationale (XRAT)''' - the explanation behind the standard.

The standard user command line and scripting interface is the [[POSIX]] shell, an extension of the [[Bourne Shell]] based on an early version of  the [[Korn Shell]]. Other user-level programs, services and utilities include [[AWK (programming language)|awk]], [[Echo (command)|echo]], [[ed UNIX|ed]], [[vi]], and hundreds of others. Required program-level services include basic [[input/output|I/O]] ([[Computer file|file]], [[Computer terminal|terminal]], and [[computer network|network]]) services. A test suite accompanies the standard. It is called '''PCTS''' or the '''POSIX Certification Test Suite'''.

Additionally, SUS includes [[curses (programming library)|CURSES]] (XCURSES) specification, which specifies 372 functions and 3 header files. All in all, SUSv3 specifies 1742 interfaces.

Note that a system need not include [[source code]] derived in any way from AT&amp;T Unix to meet the specification. For instance, [[IBM]] [[OS/390]], now [[z/OS]], qualifies as a &quot;Unix&quot; despite having no code in common.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==Marks for compliant systems==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[UNIX98]] --&gt;
There are two official marks for conforming systems
* UNIX 98 - the mark for systems conforming to version 2 of the SUS (partial compliance)
* UNIX 03 - the mark for systems conforming to version 3 of the SUS (full compliance)

Older UNIX standards (superseded)
* UNIX 93 (completely superseded)
* UNIX 95 (compliance still acceptable for some simpler software subsystems)

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other====
Other operating systems registered as UNIX 95 or UNIX 93 compliant:
*[[NCR Corporation|NCR]] UNIX SVR4
*[[NEC]] UX/4800
*[[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] [[IRIX]] 6.5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Open Group|title=Register of Certified Products|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/|accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-registered Unix-like systems===
Vendors of [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]] do not typically certify their distributions, as the cost of certification and the rapidly changing nature of such distributions make the process too expensive to sustain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Open Group|title= The Open Brand Fee Schedule|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/Brandfees.htm|accessdate=2007-05-11}} Lists fees required to use UNIX brand&lt;/ref&gt;

====BSD descendants====
*FreeBSD has a &quot;C99 and POSIX Conformance Project&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freebsd.org/projects/c99/&lt;/ref&gt; which aims for full compliance with a large subset of the SUS.

*[[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] is an open source operating system: it is essentially the open source subset of Mac OS X. Darwin is compliant with the SUS 03.&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man5/compat.5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Linux====
No Linux distribution has been registered as SUS compliant.

The [[Linux Standard Base]] was formed in 2001 as an attempt to standardize the internal structures of Linux-based systems for increased compatibility. It is based on, and also extends in several areas, the POSIX specifications, the Single UNIX Specification and other open standards. It is [[de facto]] accepted and followed by many [[Linux distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/lsb-cert/productdir.php&lt;/ref&gt;
