== Windham Hill years ==

In 1985, Aaberg signed a recording contract with [[Windham Hill Records]] and released the highly acclaimed solo album ''High Plains'' that showcased his eclectic musical background. He followed this up with five solo albums: ''Cinema'' (1992), ''Field Notes'' (2000), ''Live from Montana'' (2000), which received a Grammy nomination, ''Christmas'' (2002), and ''Blue West'' (2005).

Aaberg has performed with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] and has appeared at the Marlboro Chamber Music Festival.
