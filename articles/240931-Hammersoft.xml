'''''.hack''''' (pronounced &quot;dot-hack&quot;) is a series of [[single-player]] [[action role-playing game]]s for the {{nowrap|[[PlayStation 2]]}}, developed by [[CyberConnect2]] and published by [[Bandai]]. The four games are titled ''.hack//Infection'', ''.hack//Mutation'', ''.hack//Outbreak'', and ''.hack//Quarantine''. The series features a &quot;[[story within a story|game within a game]]&quot;, a fictional [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) called ''The World'', without requiring the player to connect to the Internet. Players may transfer their characters and save data from one game in the series to the next. Each game comes with an extra [[DVD]] containing an episode from the accompanying [[original video animation]] series ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'', which details fictional events that occur concurrently with the games.

The games are part of a multimedia franchise called ''[[.hack#Project .hack|Project .hack]]'' which explores the mysterious origins of ''The World''. Set after the events of the anime series, ''[[.hack//Sign]]'', the games focus on a player named Kite and his quest to discover why some players have fallen into [[coma]]s as a result of ''The World''. The search evolves into a deeper investigation of ''The World'' itself and its effects on the stability of the Internet.

The series has received mixed reviews. It was praised for its unique setting and the lengths it goes to preserve [[suspension of disbelief]], as well as the character designs. However, it was criticized for uneven pacing and a lack of improvement between games. The commercial success of the franchise led to ''[[#.hack//frÃ¤gment|.hack//frÃ¤gment]]'', a remake of the series with online capabilities, and ''[[.hack//G.U.]]'', another video game trilogy.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dothack gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|The player's party, consisting of Kite, BlackRose, and Wiseman, is battling a monster. The red reticule shows which monster is currently being targeted. Players may attack in real time by pressing the X button.]]
''.hack'' simulates a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]; players assume the role of a participant in a fictional game called ''The World''. While in ''The World'', the player controls the on-screen [[player character]], Kite, from a third-person person perspective (with optional first-person mode). The player also manually controls the camera using the game controller's R1 and L1 [[Gamepad#PlayStation|shoulder buttons]] and right [[analog stick]]. Within the fictional game, players explore monster-infested fields and dungeons as well as &quot;Root Towns&quot; that are free of combat. They also can &quot;[[login|log-off]]&quot; from the game and return to a [[desktop environment|computer desktop]] interface which includes in-game [[e-mail]], news, and [[Internet forum|message boards]], as well as desktop and background music customization options.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNVol1pre&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Smith, David | date=2002-08-07 | title=.hack Infection Vol.1 | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/367/367010p1.html | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player may save the game to a [[memory card]] both from the desktop and within ''The World'' at a Save Shop. After the player completes the game, a Data Flag appears on the save file, which allows the transfer of all aspects of the player character and party members to the next game in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNVol2pre&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Dunham, Jeremy | date=2003-03-19 | title=.hack//MUTATION (Part 2): First Impressions | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/390/390018p1.html | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical of [[action role-playing game]]s, players attack monsters in real time.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNp1&quot;/&gt; However, the action pauses whenever the menu is opened in order to select magic to cast, items to use, or skills to perform. The player only directly controls Kite, while the other characters are controlled by artificial intelligence. The player may either provide guidelines (&quot;attack&quot;, &quot;first aid&quot;, &quot;magic&quot;, etc.) or issue direct commands (for example, to cast a particular magic at a particular enemy) to the computer-controlled characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNVol1pre&quot;/&gt; Most monsters are contained in &quot;magic portals&quot; and combat will not begin until the player character approaches the portal and releases the monsters inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNVol1pre&quot;/&gt; Kite possesses a unique ability called &quot;Data Drain&quot; which allows him to transform monsters into rare [[item (gaming)|items]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GSPre1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Torres, Ricardo | date=2002-12-03 | title=.hack infection part 1 Preview | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=CBS Interactive | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/hackpart1infection/news.html?sid=2899191&amp;mode=previews | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] monsters are known as &quot;Data Bugs&quot;âmonsters with corrupted data such that their [[health (gaming)|stamina]] is infinite. Data Drain is used to repair this damaged monster data and render them vulnerable.&lt;ref name=&quot;data bug&quot;/&gt; However, this power also increases the level of infection of Kite's player character, randomly causing harmful side effects. The infection can be cured by defeating monsters normally.

Root Towns are non-combat areas in ''The World''. The player may restock on items, buy equipment, or chat and trade with other &quot;players&quot; of ''The World''.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNp1&quot;/&gt; In many towns, the player may also raise a Grunty, a pig-like sentient creature who can be ridden in fields and, in later games, raced for prizes. A key feature of all towns is the Chaos Gate. This blue portal is used to travel between towns (called &quot;servers&quot;) as well as access the fields and dungeons where battles take place. A [[password (video games)|password system]] controls the characteristics of each area. Depending on the characteristics of each word in the three word phrase, the resulting area may have different attributes such as prevalence of monsters or items, among other features.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNVol1pre&quot;/&gt; Certain plot-related areas are restricted from access, but the player character has another ability called &quot;Gate Hacking&quot; which allows him to access these areas using &quot;Virus Cores&quot; obtained through Data Drain.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNp1&quot;/&gt;

==Plot==
===Setting===
{{.hack chronology}}
''.hack'' takes place in an alternate version of [[Earth]] in the year 2010. After a [[computer virus]] called &quot;Pluto's Kiss&quot; crashes nearly every computer in the world, the Internet is shut down to the general public to address security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Mutation |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-05-07 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''News:''' The end of this year marks five years since &quot;Pluto's Kiss,&quot; the network crisis that nearly destroyed the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years lacking both Internet and online games, ''The World'', a massively multiplayer online role-playing game is released to coincide with the reopening of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Infection |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-02-11 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''News:''' BANDAI also announced that it will be compatible with the current key network OS, &quot;ALTIMIT,&quot; and the device will also act as an internet terminal as well. According to company officials, CC Corporation's popular online game &quot;The World&quot; is slated to be one of the launch titles.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It becomes the most popular online game of all time, with over 20 million subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Infection |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-02-11 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''NoNo:''' 'The World' has sold over 20 million copies worldwide!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Infection |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-02-11 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''News:''' [&quot;The World&quot;] is currently being submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records as the &quot;Highest Selling Game in History.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the events of the games, a number of users fall into [[coma]]s as a result of playing ''The World''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Infection |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-02-11 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''News:''' Two high school students in Kanazawa City of Ishikawa prefecture were found unconscious in their clubroom. One has regained consciousness at the hospital, but the other, Tomonari Kasumi, is still in a coma.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the developers blame their condition on [[cyberterrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Outbreak |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-09-03 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''News:''' CC Corporation said in a press conference today that comas caused while playing the online game, &quot;The World,&quot; were the result of hackers and not a flaw in &quot;The World&quot; itself.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The World'' was originally developed by a German programmer named Harald Hoerwick. ''The World'''s backstory is based on the ''Epitaph of Twilight'', an [[epic poem]] by Emma Wielant, whose death inspired Hoerwick to create the game. However, elements of the poem are also coded into the game's programming itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=2004-01-14 |title=.hack//Liminality Vol. 4 |medium=DVD |publisher=Bandai |quote='''Easter egg:''' In the &quot;Epitaph of Twilight,&quot; the one who will destroy the world is depicted as the Cursed Wave, or the Abominable Wave. / ... / In the game, a ripple-like shockwave is emitted by the Eight Phases of Morganna... Based on these events, Wiseman began to refer to the Eight Phases as the Cursed Wave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hidden purpose of Hoerwick's game is to develop the [[strong AI|ultimate artificial intelligence]] ([[artificial intelligence|AI]]), capable of making decisions for itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=2004-01-14 |title=.hack//Liminality Vol. 4 |medium=DVD |publisher=Bandai |quote='''Easter egg:''' Harald wanted to create the Ultimate AI, but could not find a company that would sponsor his project. He eventually decided to create Morganna, a self-evolving limited AI disguised as a game system that would learn and grow, eventually giving birth to the ultimate AI.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Hoerwick inserted functions into the system which monitor and extract behavioral data from the game's millions of players to aid in the AI's learning process. After Hoerwick's death, these pieces of code became [[black box]]es to the current developers, unable to fathom their purpose yet critical to the proper functioning of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=2004-01-14 |title=.hack//Liminality Vol. 4 |medium=DVD |publisher=Bandai |quote='''Easter egg:''' Black boxes, mysterious portions of the program that function autonomously, have baffled CC Corp. developers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characters===
{{main|List of .hack characters}}
The main playable character of ''.hack'' is Kite, an average player of ''The World'' whose friend Orca fell into a coma due to mysterious circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNVol1pre&quot;/&gt; Kite is joined by nearly twenty other players in his quest to uncover the mystery of the coma victims. The players with the greatest impact on the success of Kite's mission are BlackRose, a fellow [[newbie]] to ''The World'' who also has a loved one in a coma; Balmung, a legendary player who seeks to eliminate sources of corruption in his beloved game; and Wiseman, an information broker who becomes a key strategist for Kite's team.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazu&quot;/&gt; Helba, a professional [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], and Lios, a reluctant system administrator, also aid in Kite's efforts to rescue the coma victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;lios&quot;/&gt; Two non-human characters play important roles in the story: Aura seeks to complete her growth into the ultimate AI, while Morganna, an AI who rebels against her task of nurturing Aura, acts as the unseen primary antagonist.

===Story===
At the beginning of ''.hack//Infection'', Kite's friend Orca invites him to play ''The World''. In the first dungeon they visit, they encounter a girl in white being chased by a monster with a red wand. The girl attempts to entrust an item to Orca but the monster attacks him and ''The World'''s servers crash. Kite discovers that Orca has fallen into a [[coma]] following the attack and resolves to discover why.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Infection |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-02-11 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Kite:''' The next day, I found out that Yasuhiko had been hospitalized.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting BlackRose at the Chaos Gate, they go to a cathedral area where they are attacked by a powerful monster. The legendary player Balmung appears and defeats it but it revives as a Data Bug.&lt;ref name=&quot;data bug&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Infection |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-02-11 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Balmung:''' It's a bug from a computer virus. The virus is rewriting the data. It has a HP that is â infinite.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Twilight, the item that the girl gave to Orca, activates and gives Kite the Twilight Bracelet. The Bracelet uses Data Drain on the monster, allowing Balmung to kill it. However, Balmung accuses Kite of causing the viral infection spreading through the game and leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Infection |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-02-11 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Balmung:''' That skill... You are the same as the virus.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kite and BlackRose decide to team up to help the coma victims. After investigating a number of leads, Kite and BlackRose track down the monster that put Orca into a coma. They defeat the monster, Skeith, but it transforms into a larger enemy called Cubia which they escape from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Mutation |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-05-07 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Helba:''' With the help of the bracelet, [Kite] and his party succeeded in destroying Skeith.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''.hack//Mutation'', the two encounter Lios, a system administrator, who declares Kite's Bracelet to be an illegal power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Mutation |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-05-07 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Lios:''' [Installation of an illegal effect] requires that you delete your character.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempts to delete Kite's character data but fails because of a mysterious encryption. The hacker Helba intervenes and convinces Lios to observe for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Mutation |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-05-07 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Helba:''' Silencing is not the only means of control. Why don't you observe them for a little while longer?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lios directs them to an area where they find Innis, a monster with the same powers as Skeith. Upon defeating Innis, Kite receives an e-mail from the girl in white, who is actually an AI called Aura. They travel to an area to meet her but are confronted by Cubia, whom they repel with difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Mutation |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-05-07 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Helba:''' You defeated Cubia. I'm impressed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short on leads, they contact an information broker named Wiseman who is intrigued by Kite's Bracelet. He suggests that Skeith and Innis are based on the Cursed Wave, an antagonistic force featured in the ''Epitaph of Twilight'', an epic poem that forms the basis of ''The World''. He helps grant them access to Net Slum, a place known as paradise for hackers and wandering AIs. Upon arrival, they are attacked by Magus, another Cursed Wave monster. They manage to defeat it, but when they return to the Root Town, they discover that the extensive corruption has spread to ''The World'''s main servers and the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Outbreak |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-09-03 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Helba:''' [Kite] and his party defeated Skeith, Innis, and Magus. Yet, in spite of their triumph, the situation only worsens.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Quarantine |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2004-01-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Helba:''' Casualties are no longer contained in the game and the damages extend to the real world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balmung finally decides to join Kite in ''.hack//Outbreak'', after realizing that he cannot halt the infection on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Outbreak |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-09-03 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Kite:''' But... it's really not something I can accomplish alone. Could you lend me a hand? / '''Balmung:''' You're... Of course!}}&lt;/ref&gt; BlackRose reveals to Kite that her brother fell into a coma under similar circumstances as Orca, which renews both their determination.&lt;ref name=&quot;kazu&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Outbreak |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-09-03 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''BlackRose:''' Do you want to know something?

Their teamwork destroys Fidchell but the aftermath causes networks to malfunction in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Outbreak |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-09-03 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Kite:''' The virus refused to remain in &quot;The World&quot; and began flooding our territory â the real world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aura contacts Kite again, but their meeting is cut short by the reappearance of Cubia. Lios, observing Cubia's power, agrees to join Kite, Helba, and the others to combat the Cursed Wave.&lt;ref name=&quot;lios&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Outbreak |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-09-03 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Lios:''' I'll keep my promise. I will help you.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Breakwater begins as the team pool their resources to defeat Gorre, with no repercussions in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Outbreak |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2003-09-03 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Lios:''' All appears to have gone well. An investigation will still be needed, but... I guess you've succeeded for now.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Server instability aborts a planning meeting at the start of ''.hack//Quarantine''. Helba replaces the server with a copy of Net Slum to bypass this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Quarantine |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2004-01-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Kite:''' Net Slum? / '''Helba:''' It's a mirror of Î© server... which is mine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the bottom of a dungeon, Kite encounters Mia, a member of his party with a feline avatar. However, Mia is revealed to be Macha, a member of the Cursed Wave, whom he defeats with reluctance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Quarantine |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2004-01-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Mia:''' I only exist in &quot;The World.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubia assaults Kite's team once again, even more powerful than before. They fend him off but are unsure if they will fare so well the next time, based on its rate of growth. Operation Orca, on the other hand, is a success as they destroy the next Wave, Tarvos. Kite seeks the advice of Harald Hoerwick, the creator of the game, who survives beyond death through his AI incarnations. Aura appears and advises that Cubia is the shadow of Kite's Bracelet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Quarantine |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2004-01-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Aura:''' Cubia is the shadow. When there is light burning in the darkness, a shadow is born. When the bracelet appeared in this world, Cubia was born as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubia ambushes them and destroys the AI Harald. In their final battle, Kite recalls Aura's advice and has BlackRose destroy the Bracelet, causing Cubia to fade away. Lacking the Bracelet, the final Wave member, Corbenik, attacks the party in Net Slum Root Town. With the aid of the spirits of the coma victims, Kite succeeds in penetrating Corbenik's barrier. Aura sacrifices herself to end the battle, restoring the network to normal and reviving all the coma victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=.hack//Quarantine |developer=CyberConnect2 |publisher=Bandai |date=2004-01-14 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Balmung:''' She was born. Both her and Morganna... To be born, they may have had to die first.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Development for ''.hack'' began in early 2000 with the goal of shocking and surprising the player, creating a distinctive product that &quot;could not be ignored&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CESA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2003 | title=CESA Game Awards 2002-2003 | publisher=[[Japan Game Awards]] | url=http://awards.cesa.or.jp/2003/prizelist/awards06/index.html | language=Japanese | accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; CyberConnect2's president [[Hiroshi Matsuyama]] played a key role in developing the concept for the series. A number of core ideas were explored including &quot;slaying dragons or being a thief in London&quot;, but they were dropped in favor of an &quot;offline/online game&quot;. Matsuyama felt that this would give young gamers an opportunity to experience online play without monthly fees or powerful Internet connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piros1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN PS2 | date=2003-05-16 | title=E3 2003: .hack Interview | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/403/403483p1.html | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers looked to a number of MMORPGs such as ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', ''[[Ultima Online]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' for inspiration. The concept also drew influence from the prior works of character designer [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]] (''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'') and scenario writer [[Kazunori ItÅ]] (''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Piros1&quot;/&gt; ItÅ noted that casting the player into the role of a subscriber of ''The World'' creates a unique story-telling situation which draws the player deeper into the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Hunatsu, Minoru | date=2002-01-24 | title=ãã³ãã¤ããããä¸çãä¸­å¿ã«å±éããå£®å¤§ãªRPGã.hack æææ¡å¤§ Vol.1ããã¢ãã¡DVDãåæ¢± | publisher=Game Watch | url=http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20020124/hack.htm | language=Japanese | accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''.hack'' was envisioned as a four-part series from the beginning of development, said to mirror the four-volume story arcs found in [[manga]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Piros1&quot;/&gt; Matsuyama theorized that the act of transferring save data across the four volumes would help to create a sense of the human drama embodied by the games' story and invest the player into the narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;network&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Hunatsu, Minoru | date=2002-05-20 | title=ãããã¯ã¼ã¯ã²ã¼ã ãèå°ã«ããå£®å¤§ãªãªãã©ã¤ã³RPGãã³ãã¤ã.hack//æææ¡å¤§ Vol.1ããã¤ãã³ãã§ç´¹ä» | publisher=Game Watch | url=http://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/20020520/bandai.htm | language=Japanese | accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games were developed simultaneously alongside other elements of ''Project .hack'' such as ''[[.hack//Sign]]'' in order to emphasize the multimedia aspect of the franchise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Piros1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;network&quot;/&gt; However, the three-month gap between each game's release allowed the developers to make minor changes in response to criticisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;CESA&quot;/&gt; The games were packaged with DVDs featuring a episodes of ''[[.hack//Liminality]]'', an [[original video animation]] (OVA) series that depicts events that occur concurrently with the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Smith, David | date=2002-12-12 | title=.hack American Titles | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/380/380116p1.html | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OVA series was meant to give perspective on fictional events happening in the &quot;real world&quot; outside the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Conrad, Jeremy | date=2003-02-10 | title=.hack//Liminality - Vol. 1 In the Case of Mai Minase | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/385/385585p1.html | accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players in Japan who purchased all four games were rewarded with ''.hack//Gift'', an OVA parodying the ''.hack'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2003-03-29 | title=è£è©±ãæ¬¡ãã¨æ«é²ï¼ ã.hack//æè¬æ¡å¤§ãéå¬ï¼ | publisher=Softbank Publishing | url=http://gamez.itmedia.co.jp/games/gsnews/0303/29/news02.html | language=Japanese | accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of the series, the development team produced ''[[#.hack//frÃ¤gment|.hack//frÃ¤gment]]'' using the same [[game engine]] as the ''.hack'' games with an added online multiplayer component.&lt;ref name=&quot;fragment&quot;/&gt; Their goal in creating the game was to observe player interactions in an online environment and gauge interest in an online ''.hack'' game.&lt;ref name=&quot;GU&quot;/&gt;

The series has received mixed reviews, but positive sales figures.

However, he criticized the completely manually controlled camera and the generic environments of the majority of levels. In his review of the second game, Dunham was impressed by the performance of the English [[dub localization|dub]] cast.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNp2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Dunham, Jeremy | date=2003-05-05 | title=.hack//MUTATION (Part 2) Review | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/400/400688p1.html | accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Outbreak'', Dunham noted a great improvement in ally characters' artificial intelligence, as well as enemies'.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNp3&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Dunham, Jeremy | date=2003-09-09 | title=.hack//OUTBREAK (Part 3) Review | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/437/437101p1.html | accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also described ''Outbreak'' and ''Quarantine'' as much more compelling story-wise than the first two.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNp3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNp4&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Dunham, Jeremy | date=2004-01-13 | title=.hack//QUARANTINE (Part 4) Review | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/462/462425p1.html | accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, IGN named ''.hack//Mutation'' PlayStation&amp;nbsp;2 Game of the Month for May 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;GOTM&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN PS2 | date=2003-05-30 | title=Game of the Month: May 2003 | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/421/421686p1.html | accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Kasavin of [[GameSpot]] found the ''.hack'' series to be a very standard action role-playing game, scenario aside, and called it a sub-par version of ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Kasavin, Greg | date=2003-02-08 | title=.hack//Infection Part 1 Review | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=CBS Interactive | url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/rpg/hackpart1infection/review.html | accessdate=2010-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the soundtrack as a mix of appropriate music with some obnoxious themes.

The ''.hack'' games are set after ''[[.hack//Sign]]'', a TV [[anime]] series that establishes the games' setting, ''The World''. As part of a larger multimedia franchise, the games have inspired a variety of subsequent games, novels, [[manga]], and anime series. ''.hack//Another Birth'' is a series of novels that retell the story of the games from BlackRose's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=.hack// Another Birth Volume 1 | publisher=[[Tokyopop]] | url=http://www.tokyopop.com/product/1622/hackAnotherBirth/1 | accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''.hack//XXXX'' serves as a manga adaptation of the game's story with various changes, such as Cubia acting as a player character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Miss Anonymous | date=2010-05-27 | title=.hack//XXXX (Manga) Review | publisher=theOtaku | url=http://www.theotaku.com/worlds/aamr/view/167089/.hack%7C%7Cxxxx_(manga)/ | accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official &quot;sequel&quot; to the games is ''[[.hack//Legend of the Twilight]]'', which began serializing on July 30, 2002.

===.hack//fragment===
''.hack//fragment'' is a [[multiplayer online game]] based on the fictional MMORPG, ''The World''. It was released only in Japan on November 23, 2005 and online service ended on January 18, 2007, after being extended two months due to popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=2006-11-22 | title=ãéè¦ããµã¼ãã¹çµäºã®ãç¥ãã | publisher=Bandai | url=http://www.hack.channel.or.jp/fragment/support/news/1122_news1.html | accessdate=2010-12-12 | language=Japanese | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070117124843/http://www.hack.channel.or.jp/fragment/support/news/1122_news1.html | archivedate=2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Famitsu|Famitsu Weekly]]'' gave ''.hack//fragment'' a 29/40, much like its reviews of the main series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gamestats.com/objects/757/757459/ | title=.hack//Fragment | work=[[GameStats]] | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designer Hiroshi Matsuyama described the game as a way to see how players would react to online play.&lt;ref name=&quot;GU&quot;/&gt; The game uses the same [[game engine]] as the ''.hack'' video game series and thus, its gameplay is identical, with the exception of online mode. Players explore areas and fight monsters in real time. A major difference is that during online play, the action does not pause when the menu is opened. Players may still use the skill &quot;Data Drain&quot; to weaken monsters and collect rare items.&lt;ref name=&quot;fragpv&quot;&gt;{{cite video |title=.hack//fragment PV |url=http://www.hack.channel.or.jp/fragment/str.html |format=asx |language=Japanese |publisher=Bandai |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user interface and control scheme are otherwise unchanged.

Players may create their characters based on a number of preset body shapes and color schemes and may freely choose a [[character class|class]] (such as Wavemaster, Twin Blade, etc.) and character name. There are two main modes of play: online and offline. In online mode, players may enter a lobby and search for up to two other players to join them on an adventure.&lt;ref name=&quot;fragment&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN staff | date=2005-06-29 | title=.hack Goes Online | publisher=[[IGN.com]] | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/629/629887p1.html | accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game includes an expanded communication interface that allows players to chat, send e-mail, post to an in-game [[Bulletin Board System]], and receive server news updates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=.hack//fragment Online 4 | publisher=Bandai | url=http://www.hack.channel.or.jp/fragment/online04.html | accessdate=2010-07-02| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to establish ad-hoc chat rooms, separate from the public-access ones. Guilds are permanent, exclusive chat rooms for its members.&lt;ref name=&quot;fragment&quot;/&gt; A guild may establish a guild shop for both members and non-members, with full control over prices.

In offline mode, players may level up, obtain items, and learn new skills as one of their online mode characters, without the need for an Internet connection. Instead of having other players as party members, the player may invite characters from the ''.hack'' games, ''[[.hack//Sign]]'', and ''[[.hack//Legend of the Twilight]]'' into the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;fragpv&quot;/&gt; The &quot;story mode&quot; of ''.hack//frÃ¤gment'' is identical to the ''.hack'' games, with the player's created character replacing Kite.&lt;ref name=&quot;fragpv&quot;/&gt; Also while offline, players can use a PC utility called &quot;HackServer&quot; to create their own areas and dungeons and make them available online.&lt;ref name=&quot;fragment&quot;/&gt; The creators of the most popular areas are given the ability to add stronger monsters for players to defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=.hack//fragment Online 3 | publisher=Bandai | url=http://www.hack.channel.or.jp/fragment/online03.html | accessdate=2010-07-02 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
