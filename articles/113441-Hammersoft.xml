'''Morgan State University''', formerly '''Centenary Biblical Institute''' (1867â1890), '''Morgan College''' (1890â1939) and '''Morgan State College''' (1939â1975), is a [[historically black college]] (HBCU) in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[United States]]. Morgan is Maryland's designated ''public urban university'' and the largest HBCU in the state of Maryland. Though it is a public institution, Morgan is not a part of the [[University System of Maryland]]; the school opted out of becoming a part of the system and possesses its own governing Board of Regents.

==History==
Morgan was founded in 1867 as the Centenary Biblical Institute, a [[Methodist Episcopal]] [[seminary]], to train young men in the ministry. At the time of his death, [[Thomas Kelso]], co-founder and president of the board of directors, endowed the Male Free School and Colored Institute through a legacy of his estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.msuspokesman.com/media/storage/paper270/news/2002/02/08/CampusLife/Our-Forefathers.The.Founders.Of.Morgan.State-177947.shtml Morgan State University Spokesman 'Our Forefathers: The Founders of Morgan State', Feb, 8, 2002, Cox]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;History of Baltimore City and County, from the earliest period to the present day: including biographical sketches of their representative men, John Thomas Scharf, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Got my mind set on freedom&quot;: Maryland's story of black &amp; white activism 1663-2000, Barbara Mills, Heritage Books 2002, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;  It later broadened its mission to educate both men and women as [[teacher]]s. The school was renamed Morgan College in 1890 in honor of the [[Reverend Lyttleton Morgan]], the first chairman of its Board of Trustees, who donated land to the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/visitor/college/bal-hl-morgan,0,5357177.story?coll=bal-health-headlines |title=Morgan State University This historically black college has a well-rounded liberal arts core|last=Stone|first=Adam|date=2002-08-29|publisher=''Baltimore Sun''|accessdate=2009-03-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927193139/http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/visitor/college/bal-hl-morgan,0,5357177.story?coll=bal-health-headlines |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 [[Andrew Carnegie]] gave the school a grant of $50,000 for a central academic building. The terms of the grant included the purchase of a new site for the College, payment of all outstanding obligations, and the construction of a building to be named after him. The College met the conditions and moved to its present site in northeast Baltimore in 1917. Then a controversy exploded: in 1918, the white community of [[Lauraville, Baltimore|Lauraville]] was incensed that the Ivy Mill property, where Morgan was to be built, had been sold to a &quot;negro&quot; college.  It attempted to have the sale revoked by filing suit in the circuit court in [[Towson, Maryland|Towson]], which dismissed the suit. They then appealed the case to the state [[Maryland Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten Bears&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last =Harrison| first =Miles Jr.|coauthors =Chip Silverman|title = Ten Bears| publisher = Positive Publications| year = 2001| location =USA| pages =19| isbn = 0-967992-21-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appellate court upheld the lower court decision, finding no basis that siting the college at this location would constitute a public nuisance.&lt;ref&gt;''Diggs v. Morgan College'', 105 A. 157, 133 Md. 264 (1918)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some ugly threats and several demonstrations against the project, Morgan College was allowed to be constructed at the new site and later expand. Carnegie Hall, the oldest original building on the present MSU campus, was erected a year later.

Morgan remained a private institution until 1939. That year, the state of Maryland purchased the school in response to a state study that determined that Maryland needed to provide more opportunities for its black citizens. Morgan College became Morgan State College. In 1975, Morgan added several doctoral programs and its Board of Directors petitioned the Maryland Legislature to be granted University status.

===Improvements===
[[Image:msustudentunion.JPG|right|thumb|250px|New student union building]]
The school has undergone numerous renovations, including building a new communications building, a new student union, a new parking garage, and a new library. The [[Carl J. Murphy]] Fine Arts Center has also become a much used venue for plays and concerts that come to Baltimore, as well the home of a museum of African-American art.

===Athletics===
[[File:MorganStateBears.png|thumb|right|Athletics logo]]
{{see also|Morgan State Bears men's basketball|Morgan State Bears football|Morgan State University Lacrosse}}

Morgan's athletic teams are known as the Bears, and they compete in the [[Mideastern Athletic Conference]] (MEAC).
From the 1930s through 1960s, led by coach and then athletic director [[Edward P. Hurt]], Morgan's athletic teams were legendary. More than thirty of its [[Morgan State University football|football players]] were drafted by and played in the [[NFL]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/players/bycollege.htm?sch=Morgan+State+University|title=NFL Players who attended Morgan State University|work=databasefootball.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of its track athletes competed internationally and received world-class status. By the late '60s most white colleges and universities ended their [[racial segregation|segregation]] against black high school students &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.appstate.edu/WadeTolliver.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070619040328/http://www.history.appstate.edu/WadeTolliver.htm| archivedate=19 June 2007|title=Professor Revising History of College Desegregation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many top black high school students and athletes started matriculating to schools from which they had been barred just a decade prior. While achieving a national goal of [[desegregation]], [[Social integration|integration]] depleted the athletic strength of schools like Morgan and [[Grambling State University]]. For example, the annual contest between Morgan and Grambling played in New York City in the late '60s drew more than 60,000 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406EED8163BF93BA15752C0A962948260|title=Sports: Scouting|work=The New York Times|accessdate=8 January 2009 | first1=Michael | last1=Janofsky | first2=Thomas | last2=Rogers | date=1984-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the two teams do not even play each other and Morgan's home football games rarely draw as many as 10,000 fans with the exception of the school's homecoming game.

====Lacrosse====
By 1975, Morgan became noted for its [[lacrosse]] team. Lacrosse, a sport that, up until then, had been dominated by white athletes. Black high school lacrosse players in Maryland and New York still had trouble getting into non-black schools. Morgan was the first (and until the turn of the 21st century, the only) historically black university to field a lacrosse team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten Bears&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Several members of the team now coach lacrosse in local high schools. Tony Fulton and [[Curt Anderson]] were elected to the Maryland House of Delegates. Dr. Miles Harrison and Coach [[Howard &quot;Chip&quot; Silverman]] collaborated on the book, ''[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0967992214 Ten Bears]''; which is being made into a movie.

In 2005, students organized a lacrosse club which plays other college's lacrosse clubs, but the team has yet to qualify to become an NCAA sanctioned team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Daraji|first=Malachi|title=Lacrosse Returns to Morgan State University|publisher=The Spokesman|date=2005-07-01|url=http://www.msuspokesman.com/media/paper270/news/2005/07/01/Sports/Lacrosse.Returns.To.Morgan.State.University-961055.shtml|accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University will not allow the new club team to use any of its fields or facilities. The club team has played more than twenty games in the last three years, most of them &quot;away&quot; because of the Bears' lack of a home field, locker rooms or visiting team amenities.

====Basketball====
{{Main|Morgan State Bears men's basketball}}
In 2009, the Morgan State men's basketball team won the MEAC regular season and tournament championship and qualified for the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In their first tournament appearance, the 15 seeded Bears lost to the 2008â09 Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball team Oklahoma Sooners, 82-54, in the first round of the South Regional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/tournament/bracket|title=NCAA Tournament Bracket - 2009|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Morgan State men's basketball team again won the MEAC regular season and tournament championship &lt;ref&gt;http://www.meacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=20800&amp;ATCLID=204907715&lt;/ref&gt; and qualified for the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], again as a 15 seed.  Morgan State lost to [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia University]] in the first round by a score of 77-50.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=300780277&lt;/ref&gt;

====Athletic Hall of Fame====
{{main|List of Morgan State University Athletic Hall of Fame}}
More than two hundred male and female Morgan State athletes have been inducted into the Morgan State University Hall of Fame including National Football League Hall of Famer [[Leroy Kelly]] and the coach of the legendary [[Morgan State University Lacrosse|Ten Bears]] lacrosse team [[Howard &quot;Chip&quot; Silverman]].

===Choir===
The Morgan State University Choir, was led for more than three decades by the late Dr. Nathan Carter, celebrated conductor, composer, and arranger, is one of the nationâs most prestigious university choral ensembles. The groups that are subdivisions of the critically acclaimed choir include the University Choir, which is over 140 voices strong, and The Morgan Singers (approximately 40 voices). While classical, gospel, and contemporary popular music comprise the majority of the choirâs repertoire, the choir is noted for its emphasis on preserving the heritage of the spiritual, especially in the historic practices of performance. The Morgan State University Choir has performed for audiences throughout the United States and all over the worldâincluding the [[Bahamas]], [[Virgin Islands]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Canada]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. Their most recent international appearance was in [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]] at the invitation of Maestro Yuri Temirkanov, music director and conductor for the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]]. In Russia, the Choir performed in the 5th International Festival Arts Square and was received enthusiastically by their Russian audiences. The Choir has appeared at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in [[Washington, DC]] and the [[Lincoln Center]] and [[Carnegie Hall]] (in New York City) on numerous occasions, performing and premiering works such as [[John Corigliano]]âs âPoem On His Birthday,â âToo Hot to Handelâ arranged by Broadway composers Bob Christianson and [[Gary M. Anderson|Gary Anderson]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.toohot2handel.com/creativeteam.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Hannibal Lokumbeâs âAfrican Portraits,â led by music director [[Leonard Slatkin]], as part of the Kennedy Centerâs African Festival. One of the Choirâs most historic moments came with the opportunity to sing under the baton of Robert Shaw, conducting the [[Orchestra of St. Luke's]] and joined by Jessye Norman and others in Carnegie Hallâs One Hundredth Birthday Tribute to [[Marian Anderson]]. A major milestone and historical movement occurred in the 1996-1997 season with the sounds of the âSilver Anniversaryâ concert being broadcast into households throughout the state of Maryland. The concert won three Emmy Awards for [[Maryland Public Television]] (MPT). MPT continues to air this hallmark performance during select sections of their membership drives. 

[[Image:Carl. J. Murphy Fine Arts Center.jpg|thumb|left|280px|When at home, the choir performs here at the Carl J. Murphy Fine Arts Center]]
Known for their consistency of performances, the Choir probably does more annual appearances with major orchestras of the United States than any other university choir. For example, the 1998-1999 season included performances with the [[National Symphony Orchestra (United States)|National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[New York Philharmonic]], the Philadelphia Orchestra, The Buffalo Symphony Orchestra, the Baltimore Symphony, and the [[Knoxville Symphony]]. During the 1999-2000 season, the Choir was featured with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in a then-newly commissioned work for the millennium, âAll Rise,â by [[Wynton Marsalis]]. The Choir reprised âAll Riseâ in Prague, in October 2000 and recorded it with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] and, in 2003, the Choir recorded the piece in Paris. In December 2003 the Choir performed âAfrican Portraitsâ with the Baltimore Symphony at the Gala Concert for the [[Reginald F. Lewis]] Museum of Maryland African American History &amp; Culture. In their May 2004 issue, ''Readerâs Digest'' named the Morgan State University Choir as the âBest College Choir&quot; in its list of âAmericaâs 100 Best.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/best-of-america-college-choir/article36660.html|title=America's Best|date=May, 2004|publisher=Reader's Digest|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, under the leadership of Dr. Eric Conway, the choir performed [[Felix Mendelssohn]]âs ''Symphony #2'', âLobgesang,â with the [[Baltimore Symphony Orchestra]], as well as performing at the State Department at the personal invitation of Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], to wide acclaim. Most recently, the Morgan State University Choir performed for the service honoring Rosa Parks, the unassuming matriarch of the civil rights movement, who became the first woman to lie in state at our nationâs [[Capitol Rotunda]]. In July 2006, the Choir traveled to [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], for two concerts with Maestro Paul Freeman. In November 2006, the Morgan State Choir participated in a concert celebrating the Bicentennial Celebration and Re-opening of the Basilica of the Assumptionâthe first cathedral in America.

[[Image:Morganstateband.JPG|thumb|right|The Morgan State Marching Band performing during halftime at the [[Rutgers University]]-Morgan State football game in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]] (September 2008)]]
The Morgan State University Choir has shared its musical gifts on many grand stages all over the world -â with numerous dignitaries and celebrated performers -â making them cultural ambassadors for Morgan State University, the city of Baltimore, and the state of Maryland. Each spring, the Choir concludes its season at home with its annual Spring Concert, which large audiences enthusiastically anticipate and receive. The University Choir was recently in [[Ghana]] under the invitation of Morgan State alumni and US ambassador to Ghana Mrs. Pamela Bridgewater. They have performed in other major cities including [[Accra]], [[Kumasi]] and [[Takoradi]].

On November 24, 2008 members of the choir appeared with country singer [[Faith Hill]] on [[NBC]]'s Today show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27828033/|title=Faith Hill fulfills her Christmas dream|date=2008-11-24|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made appearances on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and Christmas in Rockefeller Center 2008. On January 20, 2009 the choir performed at the [[War Memorial Plaza]] in downtown Baltimore as a warm-up act to President Barack Obama's whistlestop tour speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pww.org/article/articleview/14301/|title=40,000 at whistlestop cheer Obama on way to capital|date=2009-01-20|publisher=People's Weekly World|accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Band===

The Morgan State University Band Program consist of six ensembles: the marching band, the symphonic band, symphonic winds, pep band, jazz ensemble and jazz combo. Self-titled the Magnificent Marching Machine, the marching band has performed at MSU football games, [[NFL]] games, Presidential Inaugurations, World Series and in regional and local television appearances.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The band also made a cameo appearance in the 2003 American movie ''[[Head of State (film)|Head of State]]'' and appeared on ''The Skyshow'',  a television show featuring [[Tom Joyner]].{{-}}
