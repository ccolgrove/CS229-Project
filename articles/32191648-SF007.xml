The '''Amazon Appstore''' is a [[mobile apps|mobile application]] store for the Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system and was opened on March 22, 2011. It was launched with around 3,800 applications both free or paid. Developers are paid either 70% of the sale price or 20% of the developer's [[list price]], whichever one is greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sigitarinto.com/2011/03/22/amazon-app-store/ |title=Amazon Appstore &amp;#124; Android |publisher=SigitArinto.com |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 28, 2011, Amazon unveiled a new low-cost tablet, the [[Kindle Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/amazon-kindle-fire-announced-jeff-bezos-beat-apple/story?id=14623497&lt;/ref&gt; This tablet, which is designed for media consumption in the Amazon ecosystem, relies solely on the Amazon Appstore for its marketplace, eschewing Google's Market. Alongside the tablet was a new design for the Amazon Appstore designed to better integrate with the tablet's user interface. 

The Amazon Appstore includes a &quot;free app a day&quot; feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Amazon Appstore's Free App List|url=http://www.electricbreadcrumbs.com/2011/04/amazon-appstores-free-app-list.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Every day, an application, frequently a game, is offered for free. On the launch day, this game was [[Angry Birds Rio]], in itself a promotional game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-03-22/advertise/bal-new-amazon-android-app-store-1-free-app--day-20110322_1_app-store-free-app-amazon |title=New Amazon Android App Store - 1 Free App / Day - Baltimore Sun |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Free App of the Day feature makes an exception to Amazon's 20% of list price term, giving the developer 0% of the list price during the feature day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/07/05/amazon-appstore-not-so-amazing/ |title=Amazon Appstore, Not so Amazing |publisher=GigaOM|date=2011-07-05|accessdate=2011-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The store's &quot;Test Drive&quot; feature allows users to try an application in their web browser by launching a virtual copy of Android in the [[Amazon EC2]] [[cloud computing|cloud]] for half an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Kincaid |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/22/amazon-android-app-store-3/ |title=Amazonâs Android App Store Launches: Test Drive Apps Directly From Your Browser |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazon Appstore is currently only available in the US and no official announcements have been made about increasing availability to other regions.

==Reception==
Shortly after the Amazon Appstore launch, the [[International Game Developers Association]] published an open letter expressing concerns that were primarily aimed at Amazon's distribution terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://igdaboard.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/important-advisory-about-amazon%E2%80%99s-appstore-distribution-terms-2/ |title=Important Advisory about Amazonâs Appstore Distribution Terms |publisher=[[International Game Developers Association]] |accessdate=2011-05-14|quote=''We are not aware of any other retailer having a formal policy of paying a supplier just 20% of the supplierâs minimum list price without the supplierâs permission.(...)If you ever conduct even a temporary price promotion in another market, you must permanently lower your list price in Amazonâs market''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2011/apr/14/amazon-android-appstore-igda |title=IGDA warns Android game developers about Amazon's Appstore terms|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/34108/IGDA_Outlines_Significant_Concerns_Over_Amazon_Appstore_Terms.php |title=IGDA Outlines 'Significant Concerns' Over Amazon Appstore Terms|publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main gripes about the conditions were that Appstore terms force developers to permanently lower their AppStore prices if ever they do promotions on other stores, and that Amazon could choose to lower the price of an application while deciding to reduce the developers share without having to ask permission.

Following this address, Amazon clarified the Appstore developer agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazonappstoredev.com/2011/04/clarification-about-amazon-appstore-developer-agreement.html |title=Clarification about Amazon Appstore Developer Agreement|publisher=[[Amazon.com, Inc.]] |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this failed to address IGDA concerns, which declared that &quot;Amazonâs terms represent a threat to game developers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igdaboard.wordpress.com/2011/04/19/amazon%E2%80%99s-clarification-fails-to-address-game-developer-concerns/ |title=Amazonâs clarification fails to address game developer concerns|publisher=[[International Game Developers Association]] |date=2011-04-19 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canardpc.com/news-52508-tir_de_barrage_contre_amazon.html |title=Tir de barrage contre Amazon|publisher=[[Canard PC]] |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the Swedish developer Bithack pulled its ''Apparatus'' application from the Appstore and published an open letter explaining that the store was &quot;a disaster&quot; for indie developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bithack.se/news/apparatus-amazon-july-4-2011.html |title=Apparatus will be pulled from Amazon Appstore|quote=''If you are a small indie development team, or possibly even alone, don't bother with Amazon Appstore. Create a great app, publish it on Android Market, and provide great customer support. You will never succeed on Amazon Appstore without a big wallet, or at least an established reputation so that Amazon puts value behind their promises.''|publisher=bithack.se |date=2011-07-04|accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main gripes related to the very slow review process, the absence of any means to filter unsupported devices, and that Amazon changed the price of the application without consulting the developer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2084090/game-developer-pulls-app-amazon-appstore |title=Game developer pulls app from Amazon Appstore over problems |quote=''The final problem was that Amazon changed the price without consulting the developer. The price was cut to $0.99, only a quarter of its original price, which, while perhaps good for players, is not good for the developer.''|publisher=[[The Inquirer]] |date=2011-07-05|accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the IGDA reiterating its warnings concerning Amazon policy once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/07/08/igda-still-unhappy-with-amazon-appstore-policies/ |title=IGDA still unhappy with Amazon Appstore policies|publisher=[[Joystiq]] |date=2011-07-08|accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Computer|Apple]] filed a legal claim against Amazon for using a similar name to the [[Apple App Store]]. Subsequently, Apple lost the case and judge ruled that Amazon can continue to use the name Appstore.
