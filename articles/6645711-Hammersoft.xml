'''Josh D. Koscheck''' (born November 30, 1977) is an [[United States|American]] [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] from [[Waynesburg, Pennsylvania]], a former collegiate wrestling champion and is currently fighting at [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]] for the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]. He made his debut with the organization on the first season of the [[reality television]] show, [[The Ultimate Fighter]]. Koscheck has fought for the company a record 19 times since 2005. Koscheck is often ranked among the top ten welterweights in the world by leading mixed martial arts publications. MMA Weekly currently ranks Koscheck at No. 6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mmaweekly.com/welterweight-division-170-pound-limit-mma-top-10 |title=Welterweight MMA Top 10 |date=July 06, 2011 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sherdog]] currently ranks Koscheck at No. 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sherdog.com/news/rankings/5/Sherdog-Official-Mixed-Martial-Arts-Rankings-36190|title= Sherdog Official Mixed Martial Arts Rankings|accessdate=2011-10-08 |work= Sherdog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Koscheck has a strong, well-documented base in [[collegiate wrestling]], dating back to his years at [[Edinboro University of Pennsylvania]], where he attended the university on an [[athletic scholarship]]. In 2001, during his Junior season, Koscheck won all 42 of his wrestling matches and went on to become the [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Champion in the 174&amp;nbsp;lb weight class. 

In addition to being a four-time NCAA Division I [[All-American]] (placing 4th, 2nd, 1st and 3rd respectively), Koscheck is a three-time recipient of the [[Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference|PSAC]] Wrestler of the Year award and earned the [[Eastern Wrestling League]] Achievement Award twice.

He earned a [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[criminal justice]] from [[Edinboro University of Pennsylvania|Edinboro University]].

He spent a few months coaching at Erie Cathedral Prep and one and a half years as the assistant head wrestling coach at the [[University at Buffalo]].

Koscheck appeared in the music video for [[Chevelle]]'s song &quot;[[I Get It]]&quot;, playing the man who beats up an employer.

==Ultimate Fighting Championship==
Koscheck appeared on the first season of [[The Ultimate Fighter 1|The Ultimate Fighter]] as a middleweight fighter. He defeated [[Chris Leben]] via unanimous decision to advance to the semifinals, where he was defeated by [[Diego Sanchez]] via split decision. Koscheck had his first official UFC fight on April 9, 2005, at [[The Ultimate Fighter 1 Finale|The Ultimate Finale]], where he defeated Chris Sanford with a first round knockout. Koscheck followed this victory with another win at ''[[Ultimate Fight Night]]'' over UFC veteran [[Pete Spratt]] in Koscheck's UFC debut at welterweight. Since then, Koscheck has amassed an additional three victories after experiencing his first career loss to [[Drew Fickett]] due to a rear naked choke. Koscheck then defeated Canadian welterweight standout [[Jonathan Goulet]] at ''[[UFC Fight Night 6]]'' by submission due to strikes.

Since 2006, Koscheck has been training at the [[American Kickboxing Academy]](AKA) in [[San Jose, California]], to which he accredits his vastly improved kickboxing technique.

Koscheck's fight on December 13, 2006 was against [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]] black belt [[Jeff Joslin]] at ''[[UFC Fight Night 7]]'' where he won by unanimous decision.

Koscheck was then scheduled to fight Diego Sanchez on April 7, 2007 at ''[[UFC 69]]''. This was the second encounter between the two welterweight fighters. The first fight â which did not count towards Koscheck's official record due to the bout being considered an exhibition match for ''The Ultimate Fighter'' television taping â resulted in a split decision win for Sanchez. At the weigh-ins for the event, Sanchez shoved Koscheck during the traditional post-weigh-in staredown. Although Sanchez continued to shout at Koscheck, no conflict ensued. Koscheck later defeated Diego Sanchez by unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27). Koscheck out struck Sanchez through three rounds and only initiated a wrestling takedown once. During the post-fight interview, Koscheck repeatedly exclaimed, &quot;Nineteen-and-one,&quot; in reference to Sanchez' first mixed martial arts defeat (including the two fights from ''The Ultimate Fighter'' program). UFC President [[Dana White]] announced a few weeks after the fight that Diego Sanchez had an undiagnosed illness before and during the fight which turned out to be serious staph infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On August 25, 2007, at ''[[UFC 74]]'' Koscheck was defeated by [[Georges St-Pierre]] at ''[[UFC 74]]''.(30â27, 29â28, 29â28).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmanews.com/page.php?page=ufc74results|title=www.mmanews.com/page.php?page=ufc74results&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; St-Pierre's wrestling skills were displayed during the match by outwrestling Koscheck, scoring takedowns, stopping Koscheck's takedown attempts and maintaining top position throughout most of the fight. There was speculation before the fight that Koscheck would out-match St-Pierre on the ground due to his credentials, but St-Pierre was confident that he was a better wrestler and striker and was more well versed in submissions than Koscheck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dm-stpierre112507&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=UFC calls on St. Pierre - UFC - Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Josh made his return at [[UFC 82]], defeating Dustin Hazelett by TKO due to strikes at 1:24 of the 2nd round.

He won his next fight, against [[Chris Lytle]] at UFC 86, winning by unanimous decision after cutting Lytle badly with &quot;ground and pound&quot; elbows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doyle |first=Dave |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dd-ufcnotes070608&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns |title=Josh Koscheck is gaining wins, not fans - UFC - Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koscheck then agreed to step in and fight [[Thiago Alves]] at [[UFC 90]] on just 2 weeks notice due to an injury suffered by [[Diego Sanchez]]. Koscheck lost the fight via unanimous decision. Alves landed powerful leg kicks and managed to drop Koscheck more than once during the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sherdog.com |url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/ufc-90-silva-vs-cote-play-by-play-14903 |title=UFC 90 'Silva vs. Cote' Play-by-Play |publisher=Sherdog.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmaweekly.com/ufc-90-results-and-live-play-by-play-2 |title=UFC 90 RESULTS AND LIVE PLAY-BY-PLAY |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2008, Koscheck fought [[Yoshiyuki Yoshida]] in the main event at [[UFC: Fight for the Troops]] and won by KO in the first round by landing two devastating straight right punches to Yoshida's head. The Japanese fighter remained on the canvas, while being tended to by commission doctors and was removed from the Octagon on a stretcher as a precautionary measure. He was later treated and released from a local hospital for a concussion. Koscheck received $60,000 bonus from the [[UFC]] for Knockout of the Night.

Koscheck fought promotional newcomer [[Paulo Thiago]] at [[UFC 95]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/mma/story/11226943 |title=Retrieved 01.08.2009 |publisher=Sportsline.com |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koscheck was defeated by the debuting Brazilian via first round KO. Thiago hit Koscheck squarely with a right uppercut and landed a left hook as Koscheck fell to the canvas in a stupor.  After the bout was halted, Koscheck got up and argued that he was still alert and able to defend himself. Shortly after the stoppage, Koscheck was seen calmly offering his opinion of the stoppage to the referee: &quot;Too early - just a little bit too early.&quot; 

Koscheck was to fight [[Chris Wilson (fighter)|Chris Wilson]] at [[UFC 98]] but was forced to withdraw after suffering a foot injury in training. He returned at [[UFC 103]] and defeated returning veteran [[Frank Trigg]] via TKO at 1:25 of the 1st round.

Koscheck was expected to face [[Mike Pierce]] on January 11, 2010, at [[UFC Fight Night 20]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mmajunkie.com/news/16521/josh-koscheck-vs-mike-pierce-in-the-works-for-ufc-fight-night-20-in-january.mma.mma]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead went on to face [[Anthony Johnson (fighter)|Anthony Johnson]] on November 21, 2009, at [[UFC 106]].

On November 21, 2009, Koscheck defeated [[Anthony Johnson (fighter)|Anthony Johnson]] by rear naked choke at 4:47 in the 2nd round. In the first round, Koscheck blocked a knee aimed at his head while he had two knees on the ground. Koscheck went to the ground holding his face, prompting the ref to step in. Johnson had a point deducted. Commentators accused Koscheck of faking the impact of the knee, which seemed to miss Koscheck's face on the replays. Koscheck has said in multiple interviews that he was reacting to an eye poke, not the knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/mma/2010-09-14-josh-koscheck-the-ultimate-fighter_N.htm|title='TUF' coach Josh Koscheck's alter ego comes out in cage|last=Dure

|date=Sept. 14, 2010
|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In round two, Koscheck poked Johnson in the eye twice leading to Johnson being given time to recover. Because of this, many fans think due to the controversy in both rounds between the fighters, it should've been declared a No Contest. In his post fight interview, he called out [[Dan Hardy]], the #1 contender in the Welterweight Division.

Koscheck was scheduled to face [[Paulo Thiago]] at [[UFC 109]], but was forced off the card with an injury and was replaced by [[American Kickboxing Academy|AKA]] teammate [[Mike Swick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2009/12/28/mike-swick-replaces-josh-koscheck-will-face-paulo-thiago-at-ufc/|title=Mike Swick Replaces Josh Koscheck, Will Face Paulo Thiago at UFC 109|publisher=mmafighting.com|accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Welterweight contendership===
Koscheck then signed to fight [[Paul Daley]] at [[UFC 113]] in Montreal.
Koscheck used his wrestling to earn a unanimous decision victory. After the final bell and the fighters had been separated by the referee, Daley threw a punch at Koscheck, hitting him in the face. In an interview at the conclusion of the event, Dana White announced that Daley would never fight in the UFC again. White was quoted as saying, &quot;He will never come back, I do not care if he's the best 170-pounder in the world. He's never coming back here. There's no excuse for that. You never hit a guy like that after the bell.&quot; Via [[Twitter]], Koscheck expressed a desire to face [[Tito Ortiz]] at a catchweight after his fight with Daley, in large part because Ortiz poked fun at [[Mark Coleman]] after he was defeated at [[UFC 109]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagepotato.com/josh-koscheck-tries-sell-us-grudge-match-between-him-and-tito-ortiz |title=Josh Koscheck Tries to Sell Us on a Grudge Match Between Him and Tito Ortiz |publisher=Cagepotato.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Koscheck was a coach on [[The Ultimate Fighter]] season 12. The season 12 finale aired on December 4, 2010 with the main event consisting of two fighters [[Michael Johnson (fighter)|Michael Johnson]] and [[Jonathan Brookins]] from team [[Georges St-Pierre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idealmma.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=186:the-ultimate-fighter-season-12-finale&amp;catid=50:ultimate-fighting-championship&amp;Itemid=50 |title=The Ultimate Fighter Season 12 Finale |publisher=Idealmma.com |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Koscheck faced [[Georges St-Pierre]] at [[UFC 124]] for the UFC Welterweight Championship. UFC 124 was heavily hyped due to Josh's well known animosity towards St-Pierre, stemming from his loss by decision in their fight at [[UFC 74]]. St Pierre defeated Koscheck winning by unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Gerbasi December 12, 2010 |url=http://www.ufc.com/news/GSP-Beats-Koscheck-UFC-124 |title=DÃ©jÃ  Vu for Kos, as GSP Wins Again |publisher=Ufc.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koscheck suffered a broken [[orbital bone]] on the right side of his face during the fight with St-Pierre. Unable to fly because of air pockets that formed around Koscheck's right eye, the UFC arranged for him and his trainer to drive to [[Boston]] where Koscheck received the corrective surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Josh, &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/mma/news/story?id=5918216 Josh Koscheck has to wait week]&quot;, ''[[ESPN]]'', 14 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Koscheck defeated former [[UFC]] welterweight champion [[Matt Hughes (fighter)|Matt Hughes]] on September 24, 2011 at [[UFC 135]] via KO in the first round, replacing an injured [[Diego Sanchez]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KosIn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/news/25114/matt-hughes-vs-josh-koscheck-official-for-ufc-135-in-denver.mma|title=Matt Hughes vs. Josh Koscheck official for UFC 135 in Denver|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koscheck is expected to face [[Carlos Condit]] on February 4, 2012 at [[UFC 143]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmamania.com/2011/11/5/2541091/ufc-143-carlos-condit-vs-josh-koscheck-booked-for-feb-4-in-las-vegas|title=Carlos Condit vs Josh Koscheck booked for Feb. 4 in Las Vegas  |publisher=mmamania.com |date=November 5, 2011 |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
