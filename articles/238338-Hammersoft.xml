'''Westinghouse Electric''' was an American manufacturing company. It was founded in 1886 as ''Westinghouse Electric Company'' and later renamed ''Westinghouse Electric Corporation'' by [[George Westinghouse]]. The company purchased [[CBS]] in 1995 and became ''CBS Corporation'' in 1997. George Westinghouse had previously founded the [[Westinghouse Air Brake Company]].

The company pioneered long-distance power transmission and high-voltage transmission. Westinghouse Electric received the rights for the first patent for [[alternating current|alternating-current]] transmission from [[Nikola Tesla]] and unveiled the technology for lighting in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]].

In addition to George Westinghouse, engineers working for the company included [[William Stanley (physicist)|William Stanley]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Oliver B. Shallenberger]], [[Benjamin Garver Lamme]] and his sister [[Bertha Lamme]]. The company was historically the rival to [[General Electric]] which was founded by George Westinghouse's arch-rival, [[Thomas Edison]] (see ''[[War of Currents|War of the Currents]]''). 

The company is also known for its [[Westinghouse Time Capsules|time capsule contributions]] during the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and [[1964 New York World's Fair]].

Westinghouse produced the first operational American [[turbojet]], but fumbled on the disastrous [[Westinghouse J40|J40]] project. It not only severely hampered a generation of U.S. Navy jets when the project had to be abandoned, but led to leaving the aircraft engine business in the 1950s.
