Along with [[Zayar Thaw]], he founded the group [[Acid (hip-hop)|Acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/print_article.php?art_id=18128 |title=Another Birthday behind Bars |author=Alex Elgee |date=26 March 2010 |work= |publisher=''The Irrawaddy'' |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Beginning&quot;==
In 2000, Acid released Burma's first hip-hop album. Despite predictions of failure by many in the Burmese music industry, the album, ''Beginning'', remained in the number one position of the Burmese charts for more than two months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt; A [[Democratic Voice of Burma]] reporter described his music as blending a &quot;combative, angry style with indigenous poeticism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvb.no/uncategorized/fresh-blood-for-a-new-decade-2/2845 |title=Fresh blood for a new decade |author=Joseph Allchin |date=30 December 2009 |work= |publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's repertoire has been said to contain many &quot;thinly veiled attacks on the regime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/burma,,junta-imprisons-pop-star,25495 |title=Junta imprisons Yan Yan Chan |author= |date=18 April 2008 |work= |publisher=thefirstpost.co.uk |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' stated that while the band &quot;focused on the mundane, their lyrics inevitably touched on the hardships of life in Burma, drawing them into dangerous territory.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burma-jails-comedian-for-45-years-1029913.html |title=Burma jails comedian for 45 years |author= |date=22 November 2008 |work= |publisher=''The Independent'' |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generation Wave==
Following the [[2007 Burmese anti-government protests|2007 uprising]] against the [[State Peace and Development Council]], Burma's military rulers, Yan Yan Chan's bandmate Zayar Thaw helped found the pro-democracy youth movement [[Generation Wave]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt; Though not an original founder, Yan Yan Chan became involved in the group as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mizzima&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/1512-detained-hip-hop-singer-yan-yan-chan-released.html |title=Detained Hip Hop singer Yan Yan Chan released |author=Than Htike Oo |date=7 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Mizzima News |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generation Wave used graffiti and pamphlets to spread messages opposing the SPDC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt; and distributed bumper stickers reading &quot;Change New Government&quot; to apply to cars carrying &quot;CNG&quot; stickers (originally for &quot;compressed natural gas&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt; The group also circulated anti-government films, including [[Rambo IV]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:elD48Vpaw3kJ:www.fbppn.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Zayar_Thaw_updated_29June09.pdf+Zayar+thaw+AAPP&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShKj5EAUwNvhS8TgWkCItbnbL7neJnxI1MUDU0gQCvV349q_xJBEufb2nsMGJ74qTlH9dsbtrpS_-sAI3Sk5fQmxD4HkmSywBoSDMEEK6t5wnyLClFWq5xp_Cj49Ire2b9w5HJ7&amp;sig=AHIEtbShPsRNV_Xy7Un_jusqrH3bX2j6rw |title=AAPP Case No. 0062 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Assistance Association for Political Prisoners |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the titular character battles [[Tatmadaw]] (Burmese military) soldiers in [[Karen State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/index.php/news-and-reports/news-stories/Rambo-Draws-World-Attention-to-Forgotten-Crisis-in-Burma |title=Rambo Draws Worldâs Attention to Forgotten Crisis in Burma |author= |date=12 Feb 2008 |work= |publisher=Burma Campaign UK |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had been banned by the government for portraying the SPDC and its soldiers in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579082/Banned-Rambo-film-hot-property-in-Burma.html |title=Banned Rambo film hot property in Burma |author=Thomas Bell |date=18 February 2008 |work= |publisher=''The Telegraph'' |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2008, several Generation Wave members were arrested for their anti-government activities, including Zayar Thaw, who was charged with membership in an illegal organization and possession of foreign currency.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/iar/pdf/ZayarThawCaseSheet.pdf |title=MYANMAR: Hip-Hop Artist and Student Activist Jailed for Peaceful Protest |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April, Yan Yan Chan was also arrested in the Upper Burma town of [[Monywa]], reportedly along with his longtime girlfriend Chilli.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mizzima&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ashinmettacara.org/2008/04/yan-yan-chan-arrested.html |title=Yan Yan Chan Arrested |author=Ashin Mettacara |date=18 April 2008 |work= |publisher=Ashinmettacara.org |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] speculated that Yan Yan Chan was arrested due to &quot;lyrics in some of his songs referring to the lack of press freedom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arabia.reporters-sans-frontieres.org/article.php3?id_article=26694 |title=Press forbidden to refer to campaign for a No vote in referendum on new constitution |author= |date=24 April 2008 |work= |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
