==Critical reception==

The [[BBC]] commented on the song:-

This is a song which will probably not be the sole reason people rush out to buy 'The Greatest Hits Of Calvin Harris', whenever such a thing appears. It might not even figure in the Top 10 of reasons to rush out and buy 'The Greatest Hits Of Calvin Harris', for all that it has earned the right to be on there in the first place. In fact, it possibly isn't even among the Top 5 of reasons to rush out and buy Calvin's current album 'Ready For The Weekend', from which it is taken. And that's assuming that people still rush out to buy albums, which apparently they do not.

What it is, however, is another of Calvin's hook-heavy dance concoctions which manage to sound light and frothy, and dark and heavy at one and the same time. It has a deceptively short list of ingredients: a mournful one-finger synth refrain; some sneezy drums; some booming drums; flatulent bass; a melody line for the verse and another for the chorus. Oh, and a bit in the chorus which sounds like Calvin singing &quot;beep beep beep&quot;, even though he is not. He sounds utterly dedicated to the emotional truth of his words at that point, as if he really needs to get across just how sad he is, that the person who used to hold him no longer wishes to. &quot;Beep,&quot; he wails &quot;beep beep&quot;.

And which of us, hand on heart, can truly say that we've never been there, never felt what he has felt, never wanted to point that accusing finger, never died inside a thousand times because they just could get the words out? Exactly. He's not just beeping for himself, he's beeping for ALL OF US{{rating|3|5}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2010/01/calvin_harris_you_used_to_hold.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
