The '''Tiger&amp;ndash;Sooner Peace Pipe''' is the [[trophy]] awarded to the winner of an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played by the [[Missouri Tigers football]] team of the [[University of Missouri]] and the [[Oklahoma Sooners football]] team of the [[University of Oklahoma]].

==Series history==
Missouri and Oklahoma's football teams first played in 1902, and they played annually 1910 until 1995, with only a one-year interruption in 1918 during [[World War I]].  The Tiger-Sooner Peace Pipe has been awarded since 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;missouritigers&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://mutigers.cstv.com/trads/miss-mascot-trophy.html Mascot &amp; Football Traditions]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Big 12 Conference]] was formed in 1995, and was split into two divisions.  The two universities being placed in different division (Missouri in the Big 12 North Division, Oklahoma in the South Division), which prevented an annual matchup.  After the formation of the Big 12, the teams played a home-and-home series with three years in between each series (1998&amp;ndash;1999, 2002&amp;ndash;2003, 2006&amp;ndash;2007, 2010&amp;ndash;2011).

The Oklahoma Sooners won the last meeting of the two teams, 38&amp;ndash;28, on September 24, 2011.  With the Missouri Tigers' pending withdrawal from the Big 12, and admission to the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), to be effective July 1, 2012, the future of the Missouri&amp;ndash;Oklahoma rivalry series is uncertain.

==Peace Pipe trophy==
In November 1940, a genuine Indian peace pipe was donated by Dr. John S. Knight of Kansas City to become the traveling trophy of the Missouri-Oklahoma football rivalry. Dr. Knight was a 1923 graduate of the University of Missouri.  The peace pipe, in the form of a tomahawk, belonged to Chief White Eagle of the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] tribe. The peace pipe was believed to be over 100 years old at the time it was donated in 1940. An inscription on the peace pipe reads &quot;Mystical Seven Society Ceremonial Tomahawk Pipe, University of Missouri vs. University of Oklahoma, Dr. John S. Knight &amp;ndash; donor of peace pipe.&quot;  Winners of each game are also inscribed on the pipe.  The peace pipe was entrusted to MU's [[Mystical Seven (Missouri)|Mystical Seven]] and OU's Pe-et, who would share the peace pipe in the end zone at halftime to celebrate the two universities.  The society of the winning university would return the peace pipe to its university until the next meeting of the two teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;digital.library.umsystem.edu&quot;&gt;http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=alum;cc=alum;sid=e8319a3fa1419338cf773c4bbee6e40c;q1=peace%20pipe;rgn=full%20text;idno=alum194011;view=image;seq=30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;columbiamissourian.com&quot;&gt;http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2007/10/11/case-missing-peace-pipe/&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Sooners were the first to take possession of the peace pipe following their 7-0 victory over the Tigers in 1940.  In fact, Oklahoma was inscribed 19 times on the pipe from 1940 to 1963. After a tie in 1964, OU gave possession of the pipe to MU as Oklahoma had held the trophy so many more times since the trophy's inception.  Records indicate that the tradition continued through 1974, but the peace pipe exchange did not take place in 1975.  The current location of the pipe is unknown since it was last held by Oklahoma.  OU's senior associate athletic director, Kenny Mossman, has indicated that Oklahoma officials have conducted an extensive search of their archives for historical items, and the peace pipe has not been located.&lt;ref name=&quot;digital.library.umsystem.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;columbiamissourian.com&quot;/&gt;
