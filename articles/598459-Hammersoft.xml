While a student at the [[American Community Schools]] in Athens, Greg Kinnear first ventured into the role of talk show host with his radio show &quot;School Daze With Greg Kinnear&quot;. Returning to the United States for a college education, he attended the [[University of Arizona]], where he graduated in 1985 with a degree in [[broadcast journalism]].

It was in 1994 that Kinnear had his first big screen role, as a talk show host in the [[Damon Wayans]] comedy ''[[Blankman]]''. In 1995 he won the part of David Larrabee in [[Sydney Pollack]]'s remake of [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1954 classic ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]''.

His following films were ''[[Mystery Men]]'', ''[[Nurse Betty]]'', ''[[Loser (film)|Loser]]'', ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'', and ''[[Someone Like You (film)|Someone Like You]]''. Kinnear often alternated roles, often playing good guys like a playboy in ''[[Sabrina (1995 film)|Sabrina]]'' or a gay painter in ''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', to bad guys such as a sleazy college professor in ''[[Loser (film)|Loser]]'' and an egotistical soap opera star in ''[[Nurse Betty]]''.

In 2002, Kinnear starred in the movie ''[[Auto Focus]]'' about the life and murder of actor [[Bob Crane]]. In 2003 he starred in ''[[Stuck on You (film)|Stuck On You]]'', a comedy in which he played opposite [[Matt Damon]] as a conjoined twin who pursues his dream of becoming a Hollywood actor in spite of his joined brother's desire for a different kind of life.

In 2006, Kinnear co-starred with [[Steve Carell]] in the [[Academy Award|Oscar-winning]] comedy-drama ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'', and with [[Mark Wahlberg]] in ''[[Invincible (2006 film)|Invincible]]'', based on the true story of a bartender who tries out for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] football team. He also appeared in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', playing a [[fast food]] executive who discovers secrets about his company.  In 2008 starred in the movie ''[[Flash of Genius (film)|Flash of Genius]]'', a docudrama about [[Robert Kearns]] who invented the intermittent windshield wiper. 

His portrayal of then-Major [[Bruce P. Crandall]] in 2002's ''[[We Were Soldiers]]'' brought public attention to Crandall's heroism during the 1965 [[Battle of Ia Drang]]. (On February 26, 2007, Crandall was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] by [[George W. Bush|President Bush]].)

Greg also appeared in the movie ''[[Baby Mama]]'' with Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. He played a man working in a local smoothie shop and sparked a romantic interest in Tina Fey's character. In 2010, Kinnear starred as the estranged father of [[Miley Cyrus]]' character in ''[[The Last Song (film)|The Last Song]]''.

In 2011, Kinnear starred in the miniseries ''[[The Kennedys (TV miniseries)|The Kennedys]]'' playing the lead role as [[John F. Kennedy]]. It was originally planned to air on the [[The History Channel|History Channel]], however, it was announced in January 2011 that the miniseries had been pulled from that network.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/caroline-kennedy-maria-shriver-helped-69764/The Hollywood Reporter.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently picked up by [[ReelzChannel]] and then first aired on April 3, 2011.
