The '''[[2010 NFL season|2010]] [[Carolina Panthers]] season''' is the franchise's 16th season in the [[National Football League]], and their 9th under head coach [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]].  They entered the season trying to improve on their 8â8 record from [[2009 Carolina Panthers season|2009]], but failed to do so with a record of 2â14 and were officially eliminated from postseason contention in Week 11. In Week 16, the team clinched the NFL's worst record of the year and earned the #1 pick in the [[2011 NFL Draft]].  On December 31, 2010, it was announced that the contracts of coach [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] and his entire coaching staff would not be renewed.

===NFL Draft===
{{Main|2010 NFL Draft}}

The Panthers did not have a first round pick in the 2010 draft as it was traded to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in a deal that got the Panthers a second and fourth round pick in the [[2009 NFL Draft]].  The Panthers also traded their fifth round pick to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] for defensive tackle [[Tank Tyler]], and their sixth round pick to the [[Cleveland Browns]] for defensive tackle [[Louis Leonard]].  The Panthers acquired a sixth round pick from the [[Oakland Raiders]] from a trade in the 2009 draft that sent a 2009 seventh round pick to the Raiders.
