==National Effect==
Shortly before election day, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] returned from a trip to [[Latin America]] to provide last minute campaigning for Virginian gubernatorial candidate [[Jerry W. Kilgore]]. After the defeat of Kilgore and [[Doug Forrester]] in New Jersey, Democrats prescribed these victories to the President's decreasing popularity. Republicans then tried to downplay these Democratic triumphs as victories exclusive to those states and their candidates. Some speculate that these two elections were harbingers of the positive momentum around the Democratic party, and it could be said that they had some positive effect on, the landmark victories in the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]] for the party. Republicans, however, maintain that the Democrats' advantage in 2005 was due simply to the fact that they were the incumbent party.
