In 1982 Madonna signed a recording contract with [[Sire Records]], a label owned by [[Warner Bros.

The video portrayed Madonna roaming through the streets of Venice and lying in a white wedding dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year she also released the follow-up single, &quot;[[Material Girl]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna's third studio album, ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'', was released in 1986. The video for the lead single, &quot;[[Live to Tell]]&quot;, ushered in a new image for Madonna.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the video of &quot;[[True Blue (Madonna song)|True Blue]]&quot;, Madonna's impact on MTV and popular music was established when a contest entitled ''Making My Video'', was held to create a music video for the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[La Isla Bonita]]&quot; and &quot;[[Who's That Girl (Madonna song)|Who's That Girl]]&quot;, both released in 1987, portrayed Madonna's fascination with Hispanic culture and the inclusion of religious symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fouz-HernÃ¡ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Madonna signed a $5&amp;nbsp;million deal with [[Pepsi]] to use her song &quot;[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]&quot; in one of their commercial advertisements. Madonna also wanted to use the commercial for the global debut of the song and her [[Like a Prayer|similar titled]] studio album. However, when Madonna released the actual music video of the song it faced strong reaction from religious groups and media. The video portrayed Madonna dancing in front of burning crosses, receiving [[stigmata]], kissing a black saint and having sex with him in a church altar.&lt;ref name=&quot;banned&quot;/&gt; Her other notable videos released that year included &quot;[[Express Yourself (Madonna song)|Express Yourself]]&quot; and &quot;[[Cherish (Madonna song)|Cherish]]&quot; which were critically appreciated for their positive feminist themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1990 Madonna released the song &quot;[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]&quot;, which portrayed the underground gay subculture dance routine called [[vogue (dance)|voguing]], as well as the glamorous look of Hollywood stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;vogue&quot;/&gt; The same year she released &quot;[[Justify My Love]]&quot;, whose video featured Madonna in an erotic dream containing [[sadomasochism]], [[voyeurism]] and [[bisexuality]]. MTV deemed the video too explicit and banned it from airing on their channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;justify&quot;/&gt; In 1992 Madonna released her fifth studio album, ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]''. The [[Erotica (song)|similar titled]] lead single's video portrayed Madonna as a masked dominatrix.&lt;ref name=&quot;eroticamtv&quot;/&gt; The video of &quot;[[Deeper and Deeper]]&quot; depicted Madonna as [[Andy Warhol]]'s protÃ©gÃ© [[Edie Sedgwick]].&lt;ref name=&quot;deeper&quot;/&gt; In 1994 she released &quot;[[Secret (Madonna song)|Secret]]&quot;, the lead single from her sixth studio album, ''[[Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)|Bedtime Stories]]''. The video showed scenes of [[reincarnation|rebirth]], [[transvestism|transvestites]] and [[damnation]], which are interspersed with Madonna walking down a street to her home.&lt;ref name=&quot;secretvideo&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Miklitsch|1998|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Bedtime Story (Madonna song)|Bedtime Story]]&quot;, from the same album, showed a dream sequence, inspired by paintings of [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Remedios Varo]], while incorporating [[new age]] surrealistic images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fouz-HernÃ¡ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Madonna released her seventh studio album, ''[[Ray of Light]]''. The music video for the lead single, &quot;[[Frozen (song)|Frozen]]&quot;, ushered in a new image for her with the incorporation of Indian influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video for the [[Ray of Light (song)|title single]] was a [[Fast forward|high-speed]] one, portraying people going through their daily lives, with images of Madonna in black denim dancing to the music.&lt;ref name=&quot;ray2&quot;/&gt; Her fascination and incorporation of Asian culture continued with the video of &quot;[[Nothing Really Matters]]&quot; (1999) where she appeared as a [[geisha]].&lt;ref name=&quot;worldpremiere&quot;/&gt;

In 2000 Madonna released her eighth studio album, ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]''. The [[Music (Madonna song)|title single]] featured her in the role of a [[pimp]] while changing her image to that of a glamorous cowgirl.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fouz-HernÃ¡ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video for the last single, &quot;[[What It Feels Like for a Girl]]&quot;, portrayed Madonna going around the city in a car, accompanied by an old woman, and vandalising as well as committing crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;wiflfag&quot;/&gt; This fascination for violence continued with the music videos of &quot;[[Die Another Day (song)|Die Another Day]]&quot; (2002) and &quot;[[American Life (song)|American Life]]&quot; (2003), the lead single from her ninth studio album [[American Life|of the same name]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dieanother&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article836335/Die_teuersten_Musikvideos_aller_Zeiten.html|title=Die teuersten Musikvideos aller Zeiten|date=2007-04-27|work=[[Die Welt]]|publisher=[[Axel Springer AG]]|accessdate=2009-12-24|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video for the latter, shot [[2003 invasion of Iraq|pre-Iraq war of 2003]], portrayed a military-chic fashion show.&lt;ref name=&quot;fouzamerican&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fouz-HernÃ¡ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna's tenth studio album, ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'', was released in 2005. The video for the lead single, &quot;[[Hung Up]]&quot;, was a tribute to [[John Travolta]] and his movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;hungup&quot;/&gt; Her eleventh studio album, ''[[Hard Candy (Madonna album)|Hard Candy]]'', was released in 2008; its lead single, &quot;[[4 Minutes (Madonna song)|4 Minutes]]&quot;, portrayed her as a superhero, tackling physical obstacles.&lt;ref name=&quot;4min&quot;/&gt; Her most recent music video for the song &quot;[[Celebration (Madonna song)|Celebration]]&quot; was critiqued as a return to her dance roots.&lt;ref name=&quot;cele&quot;/&gt; 

Madonna has worked with many successful directors and produced music videos that are considered by some as works of art. Her videos have depicted controversial subjects such as teen pregnancy, racism, religion, sex, and violence. In their book, ''The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary'', authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson stated that more than any other recent pop star, Madonna has used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and to enhance her recorded work. According to them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;It's hard to imagine discussing many of her songs without discussing any of the related videos. Most of the controversy surrounding her most-discussed songs, notably &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, has to do with the video images created to promote the song, rather than the song itself. In fact, many of her seem more significant than they are because of the impact of the accompanying videos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Madonna has been honored with 20 [[MTV Video Music Award]]sâthe most for any artistâincluding the lifetime achievement &quot;[[MTV Video Vanguard Award|Video Vanguard Award]]&quot; in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who has won the most MTV Video Music Awards?|date=March 2008|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|publisher=Vibe Media Group|issn=1070-4701|volume=16|issue=2|page=58|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, MTV named her &quot;The Greatest Music Video Star Ever&quot; and said that &quot;Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landrum|2007|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
