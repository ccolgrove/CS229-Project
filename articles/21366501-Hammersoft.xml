'''WACS''' ('''West Africa Cable System''') is an under-construction [[submarine communications cable]] linking [[South Africa]] with the [[United Kingdom]] along the west coast of Africa which is being constructed by [[Alcatel-Lucent]]. The cable is 14,000&amp;nbsp;km in length, linking from [[Yzerfontein]] in the [[Western Cape]] of South Africa to [[London]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It has 15 [[terminal stations]] along the western coast of Africa. The total cost for the cable system is $600 million. [[MTN Group]] has invested $90 million in the cable making it the largest investor, and in return will receive 11% of the initial capacity of the cable.

==Landing points==
The cable is expected to land in the following countries:

#[[South Africa]], [[Western Cape]], [[Yzerfontein]]
#[[Namibia]]
#[[Angola]]
#[[Democratic Republic of Congo]]
#[[Republic of Congo]]
#[[Cameroon]]
#[[Nigeria]]
#[[Togo]]
#[[Ghana]]
#[[CÃ´te dâIvoire]]
#[[Cape Verde]]
#[[Canary Islands]]
#[[Portugal]]
#[[United Kingdom]], [[London]]

The landings in Namibia, the DRC, the Republic of Congo and Togo will provide the first direct connections for these countries to the global submarine cable network.{{Cn|date=November 2011}}

==Design capacity==
The design capacity of WACS is at least 3.84 Tbit/s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neotel.co.za/neotel/view/neotel/en/page14?oid=77193&amp;sn=Detail&lt;/ref&gt; now upgraded to 5.12 Tbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/wps/portal/!ut/p/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd4x3tXDUL8h2VAQAURh_Yw!!?LMSG_CABINET=Docs_and_Resource_Ctr&amp;LMSG_CONTENT_FILE=News_Releases_2010/News_Article_002176.xml African consortium WACS to extend its submarine cable system from Portugal to the UK with Alcatel-Lucentâs 40G ultra-fast optical technology&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and ownership==
The following South African companies were announced as participants in the construction and maintenance of the cable system:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itweb.co.za/sections/telecoms/2009/0903111044.asp?&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Neotel]]: South Africa's second [[fixed line]] operator
*[[Telkom South Africa]]: South Africa's incumbent fixed line operator
*[[MTN Group]]: a South African based regional mobile operator
*[[Vodacom]]: a South African based regional mobile operator
*[[Gateway Communications]]: is the leading pan-African wholesale connectivity and telecommunications provider
*[[Broadband Infraco]]: a South African state-owned telecom infrastructure company

On 8 April 2009, the following companies signed the WACS Construction and Maintenance Agreement:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neotel.co.za/neotel/view/neotel/en/page14?oid=77193&amp;sn=Detail&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Angola Telecom]]
*[[Broadband Infraco]]
*[[Cable &amp; Wireless]]
*[[MTN Group]]
*[[Telecom Namibia]]
*[[Portugal Telecom]]
*[[Sotelco]]
*[[Tata Communications]] ([[Neotel]])
*[[Telkom South Africa]]
*[[Togo Telecom]]
*[[Vodacom]]

A supply contract has been signed between the consortium members and [[Alcatel-Lucent]] Submarine Networks.

The commercial service is unlikely to be launched before the end of the first quarter 2012 and is expected for the second quarter of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://mybroadband.co.za/news/telecoms/30188-wacs-undersea-cable-update.html&lt;/ref&gt;
