==Brief Character History==
Whipple &quot;Whip&quot; Jones III first appears when [[Ridge Forrester]] attempts to wrestle control of Forrester Creations away from CEO [[Brooke Logan]] while she is away attempting to deal with a unexpected pregnancy. After Brooke returns to the company, it is revealed that Whip spent twelve years working as a promotions manager for the company. After an attempt by Brooke to solidify family interests results in Whip being passed over in favor of [[Deacon Sharpe]] for the position of promotions manager, Whip feels resentment towards Brooke.

==[[Brooke Logan|Brooke Logan Forrester]]==
===Who's the Daddy?===
After an attempt is made on the part of [[Stephanie Forrester (The Bold and the Beautiful)|Stephanie Forrester]] to humiliate Brooke at a [[Forrester Creations]] press conference by revealing that Brooke is several months pregnant, Whip uses the opportunity to align himself with Brooke and claims he fathered her child to subdue the paparazzi. This confuses Brooke's children, [[Bridget Forrester]] and [[Rick Forrester]] as they previously heard nothing about Whip.

===Deacon father of Brooke's child===
Rick and Bridget begin to research Whip and discover that despite working with Forrester Creations since 1990, Whip still lives in an apartment with his mother in a less than desirable part of [[Los Angeles]]. Whip, meanwhile, discovers that Deacon is the father of Brooke's child and uses this information in order to blackmail her into presenting him with a car, a raise, a house and a yacht.

===Unconsummated Marriage===
Despite all this, Whip eventually develops genuine feelings for Brooke and unsuccessfully attempts to seduce her multiple times. In an effort to prevent any future indiscretions with Deacon, Brooke moves to [[Paris, France|Paris]] briefly with Whip. After Brooke once again sleeps with Deacon while in Paris, Whip convinces her that only by marrying him can she bring an end to her affair with Deacon, which she agrees to but still pines for Deacon. Whip and Brooke's charade works until Bridget overheard her confess that she slept with Deacon, which results in her disowning Brooke and leaving Deacon. After Brooke delivers the baby and Bridget learnes the truth, there is no reason for Whip and Brooke to remain married. Whip and Brooke were like her and Grant Chambers in the beginning. Married only in name. Whip has the marriage annulled. Whip transfers himself to Forrester International, where he remains for seven years.

===Stephanie Seeks out Whip===
In 2009, Stephanie began searching for a new public relations person for her new company, Jackie M, when she came across Whip's resume and decided that not only would he prove to be a capable public relations person but also a means to distract Brooke,( unaware that Brooke and Whip never had a sexual relationship as husband and wife before or after their marriage) which later proves to be unsuccessful.

==Taylor Hayes Forrester becoming '''Mrs. Taylor Hayes Jones'''==
In spite of Brooke's concerns (thinking Taylor was with him another one of her ex's to spite her) regarding Whip and Taylor's relationship she decided to help her friend Whip out by both couples having a dinner together. Whip and Taylor/ Brooke and Ridge. By the end of the dinner she was concerned and told Whip but encouraged him in the relationship.On April 1, 2010 Whip married Brooke's longtime rival, [[Taylor Hayes Forrester]], after a brief courtship. After the wedding and as time has passed Brooke grew to believe they are a legitimate married couple and not an attempt for Taylor to compete with her again for another male.  They seem very happy together despite the fact that they work for rival fashion companies, [[Jackie M Designs]] (Whip) &amp; [[Forrester Creations]] ([[Taylor Forrester|Taylor]]), which Taylor was part-owner.
Whip shares Taylor's concern over her daughter Steffy &amp; her infatuation with Whip's cousin Oliver Jones whose girlfriend is Hope Logan. His concern for his stepdaughter grows after Ridge fires her from Forrester Creations and after Hope dumps Oliver for Liam Cooper. Now Steffy is following in her mother's footsteps and wants Liam now for herself since Oliver is now old news. Whip tries to get across to Taylor that Steffy has a problem but knows that it's difficult for a mother to see their own child's flaws.

===Whip warns Amber Moore===
Whip is also worried about his cousin Agnes, Oliver's older sister, because of her new relationship with Nick Marone, whose marriage to Whip's former stepdaughter Bridget Forrester recently ended in divorce. Whip is happy for Aggie because she's overcome a lot to get to where she is now but gives Amber Moore a strong warning after hearing her apologize to Nick for accidentally kissing him. He lets her know he's on to her game and he knows what she's capable of and if she hurts Aggie she'll have him to deal with.

=== Thomas' publicity stunt gone wrong ===
Whip also finds him involved in a scandal involving Forrester Creations when he suggests to his stepson Thomas to use some sort of publicity stunt to attract attention to his new men's clothing line. Thomas uses the idea &amp; winds kissing an unsuspecting Brooke on the runway causing a media firestorm. Whip confesses to Eric that it was he who suggested that Thomas try the stunt in order to get the media attention that Thomas felt his clothing line deserved because he felt that he was being upstaged by Hope &amp; her successful clothing line, &quot;Hope for the Future&quot;. Eric understands but lets Whip know that Brooke willingly played a part in the whole mess even though it is clear that she had no idea what Thomas was intending to do.

=== '''Whip vs. Ridge''' ===
When Whip notices how close Ridge &amp; Taylor are becoming especially in the wake of Thomas' publicity stunt involving Brooke, Whip warns Ridge to stay away from Taylor. Aggie later tells Whip to not mess with the Forresters, but Whip is determined to make sure he doesn't lose his wife to Ridge. The vendetta between both men looks like it's not going to end anytime soon.
===Whip's wife is running after Ridge Forrester===
Unknown to Whip, Taylor is running after Ridge in Paris, France urging him to dump Brooke for the sake of Thomas, who is back in Los Angeles trying to work on his clothing line, Taboo. Ridge alerts Brooke and Stephanie to join him and Taylor in Paris. Ridge then has all three women leave the room. Taylor and Stephanie think that Ridge is going to dump Brooke and run back to Taylor, (which he told her he would do if another possible scandle arose) whose married to Whip is now in jeporady. Taylor is outraged and furious when she sees in lighting upon the Eiffel Tower a heart that says &quot;Brooke and Ridge&quot;. She vows to Stephanie that she will destroy Brooke and Ridge's marriage whatever it costs. She claims she'll do it for the sake of their son Thomas Forrester, but Taylor may be doing it for purely selfish reasons.
===Sick of Taylor's Games===
Whip calls his wife out on her attempt to make Brooke always look like the crook when it was Thomas who kissed Brooke on the runway and when she was asleep and he knows it's an attempt to break up Ridge and Brooke's marriage in order for Ridge to run back to her. Taylor also blasted out of her mouth that Ridge was still her husband, which had upset Whip greatly. 

Taylor also becomes unaware that she has consumed hallucinogenic berries that Thomas had brought back from the island that he and Brooke were wrecked upon, and she starts seeing herself with Ridge on the beach when he first romanced her after she gave him advice to not go back to Brooke since she was married to his father Eric. In the hallucinogenic fantasy they go treasure hunting and she finds a gold box the same as when he proposed to her on a rebound after deciding not to go back to Brooke.
