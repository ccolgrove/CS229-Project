'''Simple DirectMedia Layer''' ('''SDL''') is a [[cross-platform]], [[free and open source]] multimedia [[library (computing)|library]] written in [[C (programming language)|C]] that presents a simple interface to various platforms' [[computer graphics|graphics]], sound, and input devices.

SDL has the word &quot;layer&quot; in its title because it is actually a [[wrapper library|wrapper]] around operating-system-specific functions. The main purpose of SDL is to provide a common framework for accessing these functions.

Software developers use it to write [[personal computer game|computer games]] or other [[multimedia]] applications that can run on many [[operating system]]s including [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[AmigaOS]], [[AmigaOS 4]], [[FreeBSD]], [[BeOS]]/[[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]], [[IOS_(Apple)|iOS]], [[Linux]], [[Mac&amp;nbsp;OS 9]], [[Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X]], [[MorphOS]], [[OpenVMS]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Syllable Desktop (operating system)|Syllable]], [[Symbian]], [[webOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It manages video, events, digital audio, CD-ROM, sound, threads, shared object loading, networking and timers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libsdl.org |title=SDL official website |publisher=Libsdl.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[file:OpenTTD-screenshot.png|thumb|''[[OpenTTD]]'']]

SDL itself is very simple; it merely acts as a thin, cross-platform wrapper, providing support for 2D pixel operations, sound, file access, event handling, timing, threading, and more. It is often used to complement [[OpenGL]] by setting up the graphical output and providing mouse and keyboard input, which are beyond the scope of OpenGL.

The library is divided into several ''subsystems'', namely the video (handles both surface functions and [[OpenGL]]), audio, CD-ROM, joystick, and timer subsystems. Besides this basic, low-level support, there also are a few separate official libraries that provide some more functions. These comprise the &quot;standard library&quot;, and are provided on the official website and included in the official documentation:

*''SDL_image'' â support for multiple image formats
*''SDL_mixer'' â complex audio functions, mainly for sound mixing
*''SDL_net'' â networking support
*''SDL_ttf'' â [[TrueType]] font rendering support
*''SDL_rtf'' â simple [[Rich Text Format]] rendering

Other, non-standard libraries also exist. For example: [http://sdl-collide.sourceforge.net SDL_Collide on Sourceforge] created by [[Amir Taaki]].

The SDL library has [[language binding]]s for many [[programming language]]s, from the popular ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (via [[Pygame]]), etc.) to the less known (such as [[Euphoria (programming language)|Euphoria]] or [[Pliant]]). This, and it being open-source and licensed under the [[LGPL]], makes SDL a common choice for many multimedia applications.

== History ==
[[File:SDL-Workshop-IMG 2612.jpg|thumb|Workshop on SDL]]

[[Sam Lantinga]] created the library, first releasing it in early 1998, while working for [[Loki Software]]. He got the idea while porting a Windows application to Macintosh. He then used SDL to port ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' to [[BeOS]] (see [[Doom source port]]s). Several other free libraries were developed to work alongside SDL, such as [[SMPEG]] and [[OpenAL]]. He also founded [[Galaxy Gameworks]] in 2008 to help commercially support SDL.

SDL 1.3 is a major update to the SDL 1.2 codebase.  It replaces several parts of the 1.2 API with more general support for multiple input and output options. Some feature additions include multiple window support, multiple input device support (many mice, many keyboards, etc.), hardware-accelerated 2D graphics, and better [[Unicode]] support. You can look at the roadmap to get a sense of what needs to be done for the move to SDL 1.3/2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/Roadmap |title=SDL 1.3 Roadmap|date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDL 1.3, when finished, will eventually become SDL 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/FAQGeneral#What.27s_up_with_SDL_2.0.3F_Can_I_help.3F | title=FAQs: General | date=10 October 2009 | accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDL 1.3 also introduces a new licensing option, whereby one can obtain a commercial license to allow closed-source static linking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.libsdl.org/license.php | title=Licensing the Simple DirectMedia Layer library | date=April 7, 2011 | accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This opens up possibilities for distribution on platforms that do not allow dynamic linking.{{cn|date=March 2011}} .

== Ports ==
[[file:SDL Layers.svg|thumb|Abstraction layers of several SDL platforms]]

Because of the way SDL is designed, much of the source code is split into separate modules for each operating system, to make calls to the underlying system. When SDL is compiled, the correct modules are selected for the target system.

On [[Microsoft Windows]], SDL uses a [[Graphics Device Interface|GDI]] backend by default. A [[DirectX]] backend is also available. Older versions of SDL used DirectX 5, but SDL 1.2 (the current stable release) requires DirectX 7 by default. Sam Lantinga has stated that he plans to use DirectX 8 in future SDL releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.libsdl.org/pipermail/sdl-libsdl.org/2000-December/013908.html |title=SDL mailing list |publisher=Libsdl.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[X Window System]] platforms, including [[Linux]] and [[OpenVMS]], SDL uses [[Xlib]] to communicate with the X11 system for graphics and events.

On [[Mac OS X]], SDL uses [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]].

== Syntax and subsystems ==
[[file:Wesnoth-1.6-5.jpg|thumb|''[[The Battle for Wesnoth]]'']]

The syntax of SDL is function-based: all operations done in SDL are done by passing parameters to functions. Special structures are also used to store the specific information SDL needs to handle. There are a few different subsystems SDL categorizes its functions under:

* The video, events and threads subsystem: this provides functions for video, [[thread (computer science)|multi-threading]], and [[event handler|event handling]]
* The audio subsystem: this provides functions for audio
* The time subsystem
* The joystick subsystem
* The CD-ROM subsystem
