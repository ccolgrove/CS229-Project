__NOTOC__
'''2002''' ('''[[Roman numerals|MMII]]''') was a [[Common year starting on Tuesday|Common year that started on a Tuesday]]. In the [[Gregorian calendar]], it was the 2002nd year of the [[Common Era]], or of [[Anno Domini]]; the 2nd year of the [[3rd millennium]] and of the [[21st century]]; and the 3rd of the [[2000s (decade)|2000s decade]]. 2002 was a palindrome year, meaning it was the same way backwards.
