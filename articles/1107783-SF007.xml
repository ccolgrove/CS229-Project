'''HSQLDB''' (Hyper Structured Query Language Database) is a [[relational database management system]] written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].  It has a [[Java Database Connectivity|JDBC]] driver and supports a large subset of [[SQL-92]] and [[SQL:2008]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HSQLDB SQL Syntax | publisher=hsqldb.org | url=http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/sqlgeneral-chapt.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a fast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PolePosition Performance Comparison | publisher=polepos.org | url=http://polepos.sourceforge.net/results/html/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; small (around 1300 kilobytes in version 2.2) database engine which offers both [[In-memory_database|in-memory]] and disk-based tables. Embedded and server modes are available.

Additionally, it includes tools such as a minimal [[web server]], command line and GUI management tools (can be run as applets), and a number of demonstration examples. It can run on Java runtimes from version 1.1 upwards, including [[free Java runtimes]] such as [[Kaffe]].

HSQLDB is available under a [[BSD license]].  It is being used as a database and persistence engine in many [[open source]] software projects, such as [[OpenOffice.org Base]] and the Standalone Roller Demo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Standalone Roller Demo | publisher=rollerweblogger.org | url=http://rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20040707#try_roller_it_s_easy}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in commercial products, such as [[Mathematica]] or InstallAnywhere (starting with version 8.0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Software using HSQLDB |publisher=hsqldb.org | url=http://hsqldb.org/web/hsqlUsing.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 350 book titles document the use of HSQLDB for application development with frameworks such as [[Spring Framework]] or [[Hibernate (Java)|Hibernate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Books referring to HSQLDB | publisher=Google Books | url=http://books.google.com/books?q=hsqldb&amp;btnG=Search+Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transaction support ==

HSQLDB version 2.0 has three transaction control modes. It supports read committed and serializable isolation levels with table level locks or with multiversion concurrency control ([[Multiversion concurrency control|MVCC]]), or a combination of locks and MVCC. version 1.8.1 supports [[transaction isolation]] level 0 (read uncommitted) only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HSQLDB Documentation | url = http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/sessions-chapt.html#sqlgeneral_trans_cc-sect  | publisher=hsqldb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Data storage ==

HSQLDB has two main table types used for durable read-write data storage (i.e. if transaction has been successfully committed, it is guaranteed that the data will survive system failure and will keep its integrity).

The default MEMORY type stores all data changes to the disk in the form of a [[SQL]] script. During engine start up, these commands are executed and data is reconstructed into the memory. While this behavior is not suitable for very large tables, it provides highly regarded performance benefits and is easy to debug.

Another table type is CACHED, which allows one to store gigabytes of data, at the cost of the slower performance. HSQLDB engine loads them only partially and synchronizes the data to the disk on transaction commits. However, the engine always loads all rows affected during an update into the memory. This renders very large updates impossible without splitting the work into smaller parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HSQLDB Documentation | url = http://hsqldb.org/doc/guide/ch05.html#N10DED | publisher=hsqldb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other table types allow for read-write [[Comma-separated values|CSV]]-file access (these tables can participate, for example, in queries with JOINs and simplify spreadsheet processing) and read-write non-durable in-memory data storage.

== SQL features ==

HSQLDB 2.0 supports all the core features and 148{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} optional features of [[SQL:2008]]. Advanced features include user-defined SQL procedures and functions, schemas, datetime intervals, updatable views, arrays, lobs, full and lateral joins and set operations. Many non-standard functions such as TO_CHAR and DECODE are also supported. Extensions to Standard SQL include user-defined aggregate functions.

== Releases ==

Several versions of HSQLDB have been released since 2001. Early versions were based on the discontinued HypersonicSQL database engine. Version 2.0, released in 2010, is mostly new code, written to conform to Standard [[SQL]] and [[Java Database Connectivity|JDBC]] 4 Specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The new HSQLDB | publisher=hsqldb.org | url=http://hsqldb.org/web/features200.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
