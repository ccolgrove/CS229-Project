'''Facebook''' is a [[social networking service]] and website launched in February 2004, operated and privately owned by Facebook, Inc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growth&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate =December 19, 2008 |url=http://venturebeat.com/2008/12/18/2008-growth-puts-facebook-in-better-position-to-make-money/ |title=2008 Growth Puts Facebook In Better Position to Make Money |work=VentureBeat |location =San Francisco |date=December 18, 2008 |author=Eldon, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|July 2011}}, Facebook has more than 800&amp;nbsp;million active users.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblogs.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2011/09/facebook-f8-media-features.html | work=[[LA Times]] | title=Facebook F8: Redesigning and hitting 800 million users | date=September 22, 2011 | accessdate= September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users must register before using the site, after which they may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, and exchange messages, including automatic notifications&lt;!-- of whom? --&gt; when they update their profile. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as &quot;People From Work&quot; or &quot;Close Friends&quot;. The name of the service stems from the [[Facebook (directory)|colloquial name for the book]] given to students at the start of the academic year by some university administrations in the United States to help students get to know each other. Facebook allows any users who declare themselves to be at least 13 years old to become registered users of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/parents|title=Information For Parents and Educators|accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook was founded by [[Mark Zuckerberg]] with his college roommates and fellow students [[Eduardo Saverin]], [[Dustin Moskovitz]] and [[Chris Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-facebook-was-founded-2010-3#we-can-talk-about-that-after-i-get-all-the-basic-functionality-up-tomorrow-night-1 |title=At Last&amp;nbsp;â The Full Story Of How Facebook Was Founded |work=Business Insider |first=Nicholas |last=Carlson |date=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Web site's membership was initially limited by the founders to [[Harvard]] students, but was expanded to other colleges in the [[Boston]] area, the [[Ivy League]], and [[Stanford University]]. It gradually added support for students at various other universities before opening to high school students, and eventually to anyone aged 13 and over. However, based on ConsumersReports.org on May 2011, there are 7.5 million children under 13 with accounts, violating the site's terms of service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.consumerreports.org/electronics/2011/05/five-million-facebook-users-are-10-or-younger.html |title=Five million Facebook users are 10 or younger |work= ConsumerReports.org |date=May 10, 2011 |accessdate =May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A January 2009 [[Compete.com]] study ranked Facebook as the most used social networking service by worldwide monthly active users.&lt;ref name=Kazeniac&gt;{{Cite news |author=Kazeniac, Andy |title=Social Networks: Facebook Takes Over Top Spot, Twitter Climbs |url=http://blog.compete.com/2009/02/09/facebook-myspace-twitter-social-network/ |date=February 9, 2009 |work =Compete Pulse blog |accessdate=February 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' included the site on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;How on earth did we stalk our exes, remember our co-workers' birthdays, bug our friends, and play a rousing game of [[Lexulous|Scrabulous]] before Facebook?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Geier, Thom |coauthors=Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; ''et al.'' |date=December 11, 2009 |title=THE 100 Greatest Movies, TV Shows, Albums, Books, Characters, Scenes, Episodes, Songs, Dresses, Music Videos, and Trends that entertained us over the 10 Years |work=Entertainment Weekly | location = New York |issue=(1079/1080):74â84}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantcast]] estimates Facebook has 138.9 million monthly unique U.S. visitors in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quantcast.com/facebook.com |title=facebook.com&amp;nbsp;â Quantcast Audience Profile |publisher=Quantcast.com |date=April 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Social Media Today'', in April 2010 an estimated 41.6% of the U.S. population had a Facebook account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first= Roy | last= Wells |work= Social Media Today |url=http://www.socialmediatoday.com/roywells1/158020/416-us-population-has-facebook-account |title=41.6% of the U.S. Population has a Facebook account |date=August 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, Facebook's market growth started to stall in some regions, with the site losing 7 million active users in the United States and Canada in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/TECH/social.media/06/13/facebook.dropping.america/index.html|title=Is Facebook growth stalling in North America?|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Facebook|Timeline of Facebook}}
[[File:MarkZuckerberg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mark Zuckerberg]] co-created Facebook in his [[Harvard University|Harvard]] dorm room.]]

Mark Zuckerberg wrote Facemash, the predecessor to Facebook, on October 28, 2003, while attending [[Harvard University|Harvard]] as a sophomore. According to ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', the site was comparable to [[Hot or Not]], and &quot;used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |author=Locke, Laura |url= http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1644040,00.html |title= The Future of Facebook |newspaper =Time |location =New York |date= July 17, 2007 |accessdate= November 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357292 |title=Hundreds Register for New Facebook Website |first=Alan J. |last=Tabak |date=February 9, 2004 |newspaper=The Harvard Crimson |location =Cambridge, MA |accessdate=November 7, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050403215543/http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=357292 |archivedate=April 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To accomplish this, Zuckerberg [[Hacker (computer security)|hacked]] into the protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied the houses' private dormitory [[ID card|ID]] images. Harvard at that time did not have a student &quot;[[Facebook (directory)|facebook]]&quot; (a directory with photos and basic information). Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fastcompany.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author= McGirt, Ellen |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/115/open_features-hacker-dropout-ceo.html |title= Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg: Hacker. Dropout. CEO |work= Fast Company |location =New York |date=May 1, 2007 |accessdate= November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was quickly forwarded to several campus group list-servers, but was shut down a few days later by the Harvard administration. Zuckerberg was charged by the administration with breach of security, violating [[copyright]]s, and violating individual privacy, and faced expulsion. Ultimately, however, the charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;facemash survives&quot;&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=350143 |title= Facemash Creator Survives Ad Board |work=The Harvard Crimson |location =Cambridge, MA |date=November 19, 2003 |author=Kaplan, Katherine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerberg expanded on this initial project that semester by creating a social study tool ahead of an [[art history]] final, by uploading 500 [[History of Rome|Augustan]] images to a Web site, with one image per page along with a comment section.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastcompany.com&quot;/&gt; He opened the site up to his classmates, and people started sharing their notes.

The following semester, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new Web site in January 2004. He was inspired, he said, by an editorial in ''The Harvard Crimson'' about the Facemash incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman, Claire&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=February 5, 2009 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |title=The Battle for Facebook | newspaper=Rolling Stone | location = New York |date=June 28, 2008 |author=Hoffman, Claire |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080703220456/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/21129674/the_battle_for_facebook/ |archivedate = July 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched &quot;Thefacebook&quot;, originally located at thefacebook.com.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepticism&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118539991204578084.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Judge Expresses Skepticism About Facebook Lawsuit |work=The Wall Street Journal | location = New York |date=July 25, 2007 |author=Seward, Zachary M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, [[Cameron Winklevoss]], [[Tyler Winklevoss]], and [[Divya Narendra]], accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called [[ConnectU|HarvardConnection.com]], while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.&lt;ref name=&quot;zuckerberghacked&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first= Nicolas |last=Carlson |title= In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg Broke Into A Facebook User's Private Email Account |date=March 5, 2010 |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-hacked-into-the-harvard-crimson-2010-3 |work=Business Insider |accessdate =March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three complained to the ''Harvard Crimson'', and the newspaper began an investigation. The three later filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg, subsequently settling.&lt;ref name=nytb&gt;{{Cite news |work=New York Times blog |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/judge-ends-facebooks-feud-with-connectu/index.html |date=June 28, 2008| title=Judge Ends Facebook's Feud With ConnectU |author=Stone, Brad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership was initially restricted to students of [[Harvard College]], and within the first month, more than half the undergraduate population at Harvard was registered on the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 7, 2008 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/jul/25/media.newmedia |title= A brief history of Facebook |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=July 25, 2007 |author=Phillips, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduardo Saverin]] (business aspects), [[Dustin Moskovitz]] (programmer), [[Andrew McCollum]] (graphic artist), and [[Chris Hughes]] soon joined Zuckerberg to help promote the Web site. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{Cite press release |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?timeline |title= Company Timeline |publisher=Facebook |date= January 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon opened to the other [[Ivy League]] schools, [[Boston University]], [[New York University]], [[MIT]], and gradually most universities in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 13, 2008 |url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/09/11/facebook-opens-up-cx_rr_0911facebook.html |title=Open Facebook |work=Forbes |location =New York |date= September 11, 2006 |author=Rosmarin, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/2.5541/1.600318 |title= Online network created by Harvard students flourishes |work =[[The Tufts Daily]] |first = Lananh |last= Nguyen |date= April 12, 2004 |location= Medford, MA |accessdate= August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in the summer of 2004, and the entrepreneur [[Sean Parker]], who had been informally advising Zuckerberg, became the company's president.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_260505&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author=Rosen, Ellen | title = Student's Start-Up Draws Attention and $13&amp;nbsp;Million | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/26sbiz.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=thefacebook+parker&amp;st=nyt | newspaper=The New York Times | date = May 26, 2005 | accessdate = May 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004, Facebook moved its base of operations to [[Palo Alto, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt; It received its first investment later that month from [[PayPal]] co-founder [[Peter Thiel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;beware&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/general/beware-facebook/2008/01/18/1200620184398.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 |title=Why you should beware of Facebook |work=The Age |date=January 20, 2008 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company dropped ''The'' from its name after purchasing the [[domain name]] facebook.com in 2005 for $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 13, 2008|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/10/01/facebook_domain_dispute/| title=Facebook wins Manx battle for face-book.com |work =The Register | location = London |date=October 1, 2007|author=Williams, Chris }}|&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Zuckerberg: 24%, [[Accel Partners]]: 10%, [[Digital Sky Technologies]]: 10%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Facebook's friend in Russia |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/04/facebooks-friend-in-russia/?source=cnn_bin&amp;hpt=Sbin |accessdate=December 18, 2010 |work =Fortune |date=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dustin Moskovitz]]: 6%, [[Eduardo Saverin]]: 5%, [[Sean Parker]]: 4%, [[Peter Thiel]]: 3%, [[Greylock Partners]] and [[Meritech Capital Partners]]: between 1 to 2% each, [[Microsoft]]: 1.3%, [[Li Ka-shing]]: 0.75%, the [[Interpublic Group]]: less than 0.5%.  A small group of current and former employees and celebrities own less than 1% each, including [[Matt Cohler]], Jeff Rothschild, [[Adam D'Angelo]], [[Chris Hughes]], and [[Owen Van Natta]], while [[Reid Hoffman]] and [[Mark Pincus]] have sizable holdings of the company.

===Management===
Key management personnel comprise Chris Cox (VP of Product), Sheryl Sandberg (COO), and [[Donald E. Graham]] (Chairman). {{As of|2011|4|df=US}}, Facebook has over 2,000 employees, and offices in 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facebook Factsheet|url=http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?factsheet |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue===
Most of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2011/01/17/facebooks-ad-revenue-hit-1-86b-for-2010/ Facebookâs Ad Revenue Hit $1.86B for 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-20/facebook-revenue-will-reach-4-27-billion-emarketer-says-1-.html Facebook Revenue Will Reach $4.27 Billion, EMarketer Says ]&lt;/ref&gt;. Microsoft is Facebook's exclusive partner for serving [[Web banner|banner advertising]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Product Overview FAQ: Facebook Ads |url=http://www.facebook.com/press/faq.php#Facebook+Ads |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=March 10, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore Facebook serves only advertisements that exist in Microsoft's [[advertising network|advertisement inventory]].

Facebook generally has a lower [[clickthrough rate]] (CTR) for advertisements than most major Web sites. According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate= July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2007/tc20071128_366355_page_2.htm |title= Facebook May Revamp Beacon |work=BusinessWeek |location =New York |date=November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while [[Google]] users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.accuracast.com/seo-weekly/adwords-clickthrough.php |title= Google AdWords Click Through Rates Per Position |publisher= AccuraCast |date= October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook's users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url= http://valleywag.gawker.com/242234/facebook-consistently-the-worst-performing-site |title= Facebook 'consistently the worst performing site' |work= Gawker |date=March 7, 2007 |author=Denton, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Smith, who was Facebook's Online Sales Operations Manager, reports that successful [[advertising campaign]]s on the site can have clickthrough rates as low as 0.05% to 0.04%, and that CTR for ads tend to fall within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://techpulse360.com/2009/08/12/facebook-says-its-click-through-rates-do-not-match-those-at-google/ |title=Facebook Says Click Through Rates Do Not Match Those At Google |work= TechPulse 360 |date= August 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, the CTR for competing social network [[MySpace]] is about 0.1%, about 2.5 times better than Facebook's rate but still low compared to many other Web sites. According to BizReport.com, Facebook's low CTR is because Facebook users are more technologically savvy and therefore use [[ad blocking]] software to hide advertisements, users are younger and therefore better at ignoring advertising messages, users spend their time communicating with friends and therefore have their attention diverted away from advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.bizreport.com/2007/07/advertisers_disappointed_with_facebooks_ctr.html |title=Advertisers disappointed with Facebook's CTR |work= BizReport |date=July 16, 2007 |author=Leggatt, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On pages for brands and products, however, some companies have reported CTR as high as 6.49% for Wall posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate= July 18, 2010 |url= http://adage.com/digitalnext/post?article_id=138442 |title=Facebook's Click-Through Rates Flourish ... for Wall Posts |work=Advertising Age |location =New York |date=August 13, 2009 |author=Klaassen, Abbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Involver, a social marketing platform, announced in July 2008 that it managed to attain a CTR of 0.7% on Facebook (over 10 times the typical CTR for Facebook ad campaigns) for its first client, [[Serena Software]], managing to convert 1.1&amp;nbsp;million views into 8,000 visitors to their Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/07/prweb1162804.htm |title=Involver Delivers Over 10x the Typical Click-Through Rate for Facebook Ad Campaigns |publisher= Involver |date=July 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that, for video advertisements on Facebook, over 40% of users who viewed the videos viewed the entire video, while the industry average was 25% for in-banner video ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |url= http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=130217 |title=Study: Video Ads On Facebook More Engaging Than Outside Sites |work= MediaPost |location =New York |date=June 15, 2010 |author=Walsh, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mergers and acquisitions===
{{Main|List of acquisitions by Facebook}}
On November 15, 2010, Facebook announced it had acquired the domain name fb.com from the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]] for an undisclosed amount. On January 11, 2011, the Farm Bureau disclosed $8.5&amp;nbsp;million in &quot;domain sales income&quot;, making the acquisition of FB.com one of the ten highest domain sales in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=FB.com acquired by Facebook |url=http://namemon.com/news/1-latest-news/115-fbcom-acquired-by-facebook |date=January 11, 2011 |work=NameMon News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users can create profiles with photos, lists of personal interests, contact information, and other personal information. Users can communicate with friends and other users through private or public messages and a chat feature. They can also create and join interest groups and &quot;like pages&quot; (called &quot;fan pages&quot; until April 19, 2010), some of which are maintained by organizations as a means of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 7, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/sitetour/profile.php |title=Edit Your Profile |publisher=Facebook |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227212605/http://w ww.facebook.com/sitetour/profile.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = February 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To allay concerns about privacy, Facebook enables users to choose their own privacy settings and choose who can see specific parts of their profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url=http://www.facebook.com/privacy/?view=search |title=Search Privacy |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Web site is free to users, and generates revenue from advertising, such as [[Web banner|banner ads]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tc&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 9, 2008 |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |title=Facebook goes corporate |work=[[ZDNet]] News |date=April 28, 2006 |author=Barton, Zoe |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080526001748/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9588_22-6066533.html |archivedate = May 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choose Your Privacy Settings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy |title=Choose Your Privacy Settings |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media often compares Facebook to [[MySpace]], but one significant difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 8, 2008 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/technology/25social.html |title=Facebook Expands Into MySpace's Territory |work=The New York Times |author=Stone, Brad |date=May 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=September 10, 2010 |url=http://mobilitytoday.com/news/009500/facebook_connect_mt |title=Facebook Connect fully integrated into Mobility Today |publisher=Mobility Today Fitness |date=May 7, 2009 |author=Ciccone, David }}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS), while Facebook allows only [[plain text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=April 30, 2008 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,134635-c,categories/article.html |title=Is Facebook the New MySpace? |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |location =San Francisco |date=July 24, 2007| author=Sullivan, Mark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the [[Facebook features#Wall|Wall]], a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see;&lt;ref name=&quot;off&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Der |first=Kevin |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=3532972130 |title=Facebook is off-the-wall |accessdate=July 30, 2007|publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Super Poke|Pokes]], which allows users to send a virtual &quot;poke&quot; to each other (a notification then tells a user that they have been poked);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate= March 9, 2008|url= http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=210552142308915&amp;ref_query=pok|title=Inbox, Messages and Pokes |publisher=Facebook }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]], where users can upload albums and photos;&lt;ref name=&quot;gifts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2406207130|accessdate=March 5, 2008|title=The Facebook Gifts|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Facebook features#Status updates|Status]], which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,22822400-5014108,00.html |title=Facebook is ... reconsidering the word &quot;is&quot; |accessdate=March 8, 2008 |work=news.com.au Technology blog |first=Andrew |last=Ramadge |date=November 26, 2007 |location =Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only.&lt;ref name=&quot;off&quot; /&gt;

On September 6, 2006, a [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]] was announced, which appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays of the user's friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2207967130 |title=Facebook Gets a Facelift|accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Sanghvi |first=Ruchi |date=September 6, 2006 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.colnect.com/2010/03/facebook-celebrate-your-birthday-every.html |title=Facebook: Celebrate Your Birthday Every Day |publisher=Colnect blog |accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url= http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2006/tc20060908_536553.htm?campaign_id=rss_tech |title=Facebook Learns from Its Fumble |work=BusinessWeek |location =New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Lacy, Sarah |authorlink= Sarah Lacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Zuckerberg issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Since then, users have been able to control what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts, and newly added friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/ebusiness/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=192700574 |title=Facebook Founder Apologizes In Privacy Flap; Users Given More Control |work=[[InformationWeek]] | location = New York |date=September 8, 2006 |author=Gonsalves, Antone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=7669123 |status=patent}}&lt;/ref&gt; on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the same activity of another user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themelis-cuiper.com/22/us-patent-no-7669123.html |title=US Patent No. 7669123 |accessdate=March 9, 2010|publisher=Social Media|date=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patent may encourage Facebook to pursue action against Web sites that violate its patent, which may potentially include Web sites such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/26/facebook.patent/index.html |title= Facebook's news-feed patent could mean lawsuits |work=CNN |date= February 26, 2010 |accessdate =July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular applications on Facebook is the [[Facebook features#Photo and video uploads|Photos]] application, where users can upload albums and photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |url=http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/24/facebook-launches-facebook-platform-they-are-the-anti-myspace/ |title=Facebook Launches Facebook Platform; They are the Anti-MySpace |work=[[TechCrunch]] |date=May 24, 2007 |author=Arrington, Michael |authorlink=Michael Arrington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook allows users to upload an unlimited number of photos, compared with other [[image hosting service]]s such as [[Photobucket]] and [[Flickr]], which apply limits to the number of photos that a user is allowed to upload. During the first years, Facebook users were limited to 60&amp;nbsp;photos per album. As of May 2009, this limit has been increased to 200&amp;nbsp;photos per album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=87157517130 |title=Share More Memories with Larger Photo Albums |accessdate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=7363 |title=Upload: 60 or 200 photos in the same album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=2305272732&amp;topic=4947 |title=How can I add more than 60 photos to an album? |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2003726&amp;l=5f3c8&amp;id=1352160452 |title=Example of album from a regular user with a 200-photo limit |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy settings can be set for individual albums, limiting the groups of users that can see an album. For example, the privacy of an album can be set so that only the user's friends can see the album, while the privacy of another album can be set so that all Facebook users can see it. Another feature of the Photos application is the ability to &quot;[[tag (metadata)|tag]]&quot;, or label, users in a photo. For instance, if a photo contains a user's friend, then the user can tag the friend in the photo. This sends a notification to the friend that they have been tagged, and provides them a link to see the photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 15, 2008|url=http://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=7|title=Photos |publisher=Facebook }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook Notes was introduced on August 22, 2006, a blogging feature that allowed tags and embeddable images. Users were later able to import blogs from [[Xanga]], [[LiveJournal]], [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]], and other blogging services.&lt;ref name=&quot;welcome&quot; /&gt; During the week of April 7, 2008, Facebook released a [[Comet (programming)|Comet]]-based&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 2, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=14218138919&amp;id=9445547199&amp;index=0|title=Facebook Chat |publisher=Facebook|date=May 14, 2008|author=Eugene }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[instant messaging]] application called &quot;Chat&quot; to several networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Announcement: Facebook Launches Facebook Chat | publisher=Facebook | date = April 6, 2008 | url = http://www.facebook.com/press/releases.php?p=27681 | accessdate = April 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows users to communicate with friends and is similar in functionality to desktop-based [[instant messengers]].

Facebook launched [[Facebook features#Gifts|Gifts]] on February 8, 2007, which allows users to send virtual gifts to their friends that appear on the recipient's profile. Gifts cost $1.00 each to purchase, and a personalized message can be attached to each gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 15, 2008|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2234372130 |title=Give gifts on Facebook! |publisher=Facebook }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 15, 2008 |url=http://www.facebook.com/help.php?page=16|title=Gifts |publisher=Facebook }}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, 2007, Facebook launched [[Facebook features#Marketplace|Marketplace]], which lets users post free classified ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 15, 2008|url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2383962130 |title=The Marketplace Is Open.. |publisher=The Facebook Blog |author=Morgenstern, Jared |date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marketplace has been compared to [[Craigslist]] by [[CNET]], which points out that the major difference between the two is that listings posted by a user on Marketplace are seen only by users in the same network as that user, whereas listings posted on Craigslist can be seen by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |accessdate=March 15, 2008 |url= http://www.news.com/8301-10784_3-9718779-7.html |title=Hands-on with Facebook Marketplace |work=CNET |date=May 13, 2007 |author=McCarthy, Caroline }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2008, Facebook introduced &quot;Facebook Beta&quot;, a significant redesign of its user interface on selected networks. The Mini-Feed and Wall were consolidated, profiles were separated into tabbed sections, and an effort was made to create a &quot;cleaner&quot; look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/idg/IDG_852573C4006938800025748D0064C292.html?ref=technology |title= Facebook Facelift Targets Aging Users and New Competitors |work= The New York Times |author=Havenstein, Heather |date= July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initially giving users a choice to switch, Facebook began migrating all users to the new version starting in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.new.facebook.com/blog.php?post=30074837130 |title=Moving to the new Facebook |publisher=The Facebook Blog |accessdate=September 12, 2008 |author=Slee, Mark |date=September 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2008, it was announced that Facebook was testing a simpler signup process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/11/facebook-testing-even-simpler-sign-up-closing-the-gap-with-myspace-in-the-us/ |title= Facebook Testing Even Simpler Sign Up; Closing The Gap With MySpace In The U.S |work= [[TechCrunch]] |date= December 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2009, Facebook introduced a &quot;Usernames&quot; feature, whereby pages can be linked with simpler [[URL]]s such as &lt;code&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/facebook http://www.facebook.com/facebook]&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728 http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=20531316728]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=June 13, 2009 |url= http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=90316352130 |title=Coming Soon: Facebook Usernames |author=DiPersia, Blaise |date=June 9, 2009 |publisher=The Facebook Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new [[smartphone]]s offer access to Facebook services through either their Web browsers or applications. An official Facebook application is available for the operating systems [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], and [[webOS]]. [[Nokia]] and [[Research In Motion]] both provide Facebook applications for their own mobile devices. More than 150&amp;nbsp;million active users access Facebook through mobile devices across 200 mobile operators in 60 countries.

On November 15, 2010, Facebook announced a new &quot;Facebook Messages&quot; service. In a media event that day, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, &quot;It's true that people will be able to have an @facebook.com email addresses, but it's not email&quot;. The launch of such a feature had been anticipated for some time before the announcement, with some calling it a &quot;Gmail killer&quot;. The system, to be available to all of the Web site's users, combines [[text messaging]], [[instant messaging]], [[email]]s, and regular messages, and will include privacy settings similar to those of other Facebook services.

In February 2011, Facebook began to use the [[HCalendar|hCalendar microformat]] to mark up events, and the [[HCard|hCard microformat]] for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protalinski&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-adds-hcalendar-and-hcard-microformats-to-events/266 |title=Facebook adds hCalendar and hCard microformats to Events |last=Protalinski |first=Emil |date=February 18, 2011 |work=ZDNet blog |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2011 Facebook users have had the ability to make live voice calls via Facebook Chat, allowing users to chat with others from all over the world.

A 2011 study by Internet scholars danah boyd, Eszther Hargittai, Jason Schultz and John Palfrey in the online journal ''First Monday'', âWhy Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act,&quot; examines how parents consistently enable children as young as 10 years old to sign up for accounts, directly violating Facebook's policy banning young visitors. This policy technically allows Facebook to avoid conflicts with the 1998 Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), requiring that minors aged 13 or younger gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. Of the more than 1,000 households surveyed for the study, more than three-quarters (76%) of parents reported that their child joined Facebook when she was younger than 13, the minimum age in the siteâs terms of service. The study notes that, in response to widespread reports of underage users, a Facebook executive has said that âFacebook removes 20,000 people a day, people who are underage.&quot; The study's authors also note, &quot;Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join.&quot; The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is a site recommendation (not a condition of site use), or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, and not 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/education/parents-children-facebook-privacy-age/ |title = &quot;Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act&quot; |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, several Facebook users reported that their accounts were hacked and their profile pictures were morphed into pornographic images. For more than a week, users' news feeds were spammed with pornographic, violent and sexual contents. It has been reported that more than 200,000 accounts in [[Bangalore]], [[India]] were hacked and Facebook denies it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Bangalore/article2635228.ece?homepage=true Hackers mess up with Facebook accounts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech2.in.com/news/all/facebook-denies-hack-in-india-assures-safety/258592 Facebook denies hack in India, assures safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
===Media impact===
In April 2011, Facebook launched a new portal for marketers and creative agencies to help them develop brand promotions on Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d508bcfc-589c-11e0-9b8a-00144feab49a.html#axzz1K4b20wrT |title= Facebook sets up site for ad creatives |work= Financial Times |location =London |date=March 27, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began its push by inviting a select group of British advertising leaders to meet Facebook's top executives at an &quot;influencers' summit&quot; in February 2010. Facebook has now been involved in campaigns for ''[[True Blood]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'', and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/04/19/4-ways-facebook-social-tv-1-video/ |title=Move Over Twitter: Facebook Wants a Piece of Social TV, Too |work=tvgenius: TV Trends Blog |author= Wells, Emma K. |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social impact===
Facebook has affected the social life and activity of people in various ways. Especially with its availability on many mobile devices, Facebook allows users to continuously stay in touch with friends, relatives and other acquaintances wherever they are in the world, as long as there is access to the Internet. It can also unite people with common interests and/or beliefs through groups and other pages, and has been known to reunite lost family members and friends. One such reunion was between John Watson and the daughter he had been seeking for 20 years. They met after Watson found her Facebook profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/local&amp;id=7739245 |title=Father finds daughter on Facebook after 20 years apart |work=WABC |location=New York |date=October 23, 2010 |accessdate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another father-daughter reunion was between Tony Macnauton and Frances Simpson, who had not seen each other for nearly 48 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.in.msn.com/international/article.aspx?cp-documentid=3570509&amp;= |title=Facebook reunites father, daughter after 48 years |work=MSN India |location=Delhi |date=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that Facebook is beneficial to one's social life because they can continuously stay in contact with their friends and relatives, while others say that it can cause increased antisocial tendencies because people are not directly communicating with each other. Some studies have named Facebook as a source of problems in relationships. Several news stories have suggested that using Facebook causes [[divorce]] and [[infidelity]], but the claims have been questioned and refuted by other commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1334482/The-marriage-killer-One-American-divorces-involve-Facebook.html |title=The marriage killer: One in five American divorces now involve Facebook |work=[[Mail Online]] |location = London |date=December 2, 2010|author=Gardner, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/57742,news-comment,technology,facebook-causes-one-in-five-divorces-says-law-firm |title=Facebook causes one in five divorces, says law firm |work=[[The First Post]] |location=London |date=December 22, 2009|author=Harwood, Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political impact===

{{wikinews|Egyptian man names daughter &quot;Facebook&quot;}}
Facebook's role in the American political process was demonstrated in January 2008, shortly before the [[New Hampshire primary]], when Facebook teamed up with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[Saint Anselm College]] to allow users to give live feedback about the &quot;back to back&quot; January 5 Republican and Democratic debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Politics/story?id=3899006&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News Joins Forces With Facebook |work = ABC News |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first =Doug | last = Minor |url=http://blogs.saintanselmcollege.net/2007/11/29/abcdebates/ |title=Saint Anselm to Host ABC Debates Jan.&amp;nbsp;5 |publisher= Saint Anselm College blog |date=November 29, 2007 |accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first =Tahman | last = Bradley |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/abc_wmur_and_facebook_debates/index.html |title=Republicans Lead off ABC News, WMUR-TV and Facebook Back-To-Back Debates in New Hampshire |publisher=ABC News | work = Political Radar (blog) |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Gibson]] moderated both debates, held at the Dana Center for the Humanities at Saint Anselm College. Facebook users took part in debate groups organized around specific topics, register to vote, and message questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first =Ezra | last = Callahan |url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=8183627130 |title=Tune in to the ABC News/Facebook Debates, Tonight 7&amp;nbsp;pm/6c on ABC |publisher= Facebook Blog |date=January 5, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a million people installed the Facebook application &quot;US politics&quot; in order to take part, and the application measured users' responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first =Russell | last = Goldman |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=4091460&amp;page=1 |title=Facebook Gives Snapshot of Voter Sentiment |work = ABC News |date=January 5, 2007 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate showed the broader community what many young students had already experienced: Facebook was a popular and powerful new way to interact and voice opinions. An article by Michelle Sullivan of Uwire.com illustrates how the &quot;facebook effect&quot; has affected youth voting rates, support by youth of political candidates, and general involvement by the youth population in the 2008 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first =Michelle | last = Sullivan |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/04/politics/uwire/main4568563.shtml |title='Facebook Effect' Mobilizes Youth Vote |work = CBS News |date=November 3, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, a Facebook group called &quot;One Million Voices Against FARC&quot; organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of Colombians marched in protest against the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]], better known as the FARC (from the group's Spanish name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=August 1, 2010 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2008/0204/p04s02-woam.html |title=Facebook used to target Colombia's FARC with global rally |work=Christian Science Monitor | location = Boston |date=February 4, 2008 |author=Brodzinsky, Sibylla }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, one of North Korea's official government Web sites and the official news agency of the country, [[Uriminzokkiri]], joined Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Laura | last = Roberts | title = North Korea joins Facebook | date = August 21, 2010 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7957222/North-Korea-joins-Facebook.html | work= The Daily Telegraph | accessdate = August 22, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 an English director of public health, whose staff was researching [[syphilis]], linked and attributed a rise in cases of the disease in areas of Britain to Facebook. The reports of this research were rebuked by Facebook as &quot;ignoring the difference between [[correlation]] and [[causality|causation]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/7508945/Facebook-linked-to-rise-in-syphilis.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Facebook 'linked to rise in syphilis' | date=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 a controversial ruling by French government to uphold a 1992 decree which stipulates that commercial enterprises should not be promoted on news programs. President Nicolas Sarkozy's colleagues have agreed has said that it will enforce a law so that the words &quot;Facebook&quot; will not be allowed to be spoken on the television or on the radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver Pickup |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1394558/French-ban-words-Twitter-Facebook-used-TV-radio.html |title=French ban the words 'Twitter' and 'Facebook' from being used on TV and radio |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Facebook filed paperwork with the [[Federal Election Commission]] to form a [[political action committee]] under the name ''FB PAC''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/26/facebook-forms-its-own-pac_n_982053.html | title=Facebook forms its own Political Action Committee | date=September 26, 2011 | publisher=Huffington Post | accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an email to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', a spokesman for Facebook said &quot;FB PAC will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/183951-facebook-forming-own-pac-to-back-candidates | title=Facebook to form its own PAC to back political candidates | first=Gautham | last=Nagesh | date=September 26, 2011 | publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
