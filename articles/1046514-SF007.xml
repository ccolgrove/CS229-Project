In 2005, labor unions created new organizations and websites to influence public opinion against Wal-Mart, including [[Wake Up Wal-Mart]] ([[United Food and Commercial Workers]]) and [[Walmart Watch]] ([[Service Employees International Union]]). By the end of 2005, Wal-Mart had launched [[Working Families for Wal-Mart]] to counter criticisms made by these groups.  Additional efforts to counter criticism include launching a public relations campaign in 2005 through its public relations website,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.walmartfacts.com/ walmartfacts.com (official public relations website)].&quot; ''[[Wal-Mart]].''

Economists at the [[Cato Institute]] suggest that Wal-Mart is a success because it sells products that people want to buy at low prices, satisfying customer's wants and needs.

In 1998, Walmart proposed construction of a store off Charlotte Pike near [[Nashville, Tennessee]].  The building site was home to both [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] burial grounds and a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battle site.  Protests were mounted by Native Americans and Civil War interest groups, but the Walmart store was eventually constructed after moving graves and some modifications of the site so as not to interfere with the battlefield.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAC&quot;&gt;(February 13, 2007). &quot;[http://www.anairtn.org/walmart/index.html Walmart / Lowe's Shopping Center Destroys Native American Cemetery]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&quot;.

In 2005, developers tore down the long-closed [[Dixmont State Hospital]] in [[Kilbuck Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Kilbuck Township]], [[Pennsylvania]] near [[Pittsburgh]], with plans to build a shopping complex anchored by a Walmart on the site. While there were initially no general objections to Walmart itself, many residents didn't want to see Dixmont torn down, despite the fact that the Dixmont complexâhaving been abandoned in 1984âwas beyond maintainable condition and teenagers were dangerously trespassing onto the property on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohiotrespassers.com/dixmont.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the land was being excavated after the complex was torn down in order to create a [[plateau]] for the Walmart to sit on, a [[landslide]] covered [[Pennsylvania Route 65]] and the [[railroad]] tracks in between PA 65 and the [[Ohio River]], shutting down both routes for weeks. While Walmart did &quot;stabilize&quot; the landslide, many residents argued that Walmart merely stabilized the hillside so that it could continue with work to build the store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07269/820488-54.stm?cmpid=localstate.xml | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Group wants Walmart to stabilize Kilbuck site | date=September 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in 2007 Walmart decided against developing the site, allowing the land to return to [[nature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kdka.com/topstories/local_story_269132453.html kdka.com - Walmart Won't Develop Kilbuck Twp.

== Allegations of predatory pricing and supplier issues ==

In May 2010, Walmart's US stores pulled its &quot;[[Miley Cyrus]]&quot; line of necklaces and bracelets, three months after the [[Associated Press]] informed the chain that the jewelry contained harmful amounts of the toxic metal [[cadmium]]. Long-term exposure to cadmium can lead to bone softening and [[kidney failure]]. It is also a known [[carcinogen]], and research suggests that it can affect brain development in the very young. Cadmium in jewelry is not known to be dangerous if the items are simply worn, but concerns come when youngsters bite or suck on the jewelry, as many children do. Walmart said that while the jewelry is not intended for children, &quot;it is possible that a few younger consumers may seek it out in stores.&quot; &quot;We are removing all of the jewelry from sale while we investigate its compliance with our children's jewelry standard,&quot; Walmart said.  The tainted jewelry was made at a Chinese manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, May 19, 2010, http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jVwU1ju0oUHJIcQI9t7NyTLkBZcAD9FQ7GV80&lt;/ref&gt;

Walmart has been accused of selling merchandise at such low costs that competitors have tried to sue it for [[predatory pricing]] (intentionally selling a product at low cost in order to drive competitors out of the market). In 1995, in the [[legal case|case]] of ''Walmart Stores, Inc. v. American Drugs, Inc.'', pharmacy retailer American Drugs accused Walmart of selling items at too low a cost for the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition.  The [[Supreme Court of Arkansas]] ruled in favor of Walmart saying that its pricing, including the use of [[loss leader]]s, was not predatory pricing.&lt;ref name=&quot;wm_vs_ad&quot;/&gt; In 2000, the [[Wisconsin]] Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection accused Walmart of selling butter, milk, laundry detergent, and other staple goods at low cost, with the intention of forcing competitors out of business and gaining a [[monopoly]] in local markets.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Hometown Advantage&quot;/&gt; Crest Foods filed a similar lawsuit in [[Oklahoma]], accusing Walmart of predatory pricing on several of its products, in an effort to drive Crest Foods's own company-owned store in [[Edmond, Oklahoma]] out of business.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. (September 28, 2000). &quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4182/is_20000928/ai_n10138957 Crest Foods sues Walmart claiming predatory pricing].&quot; ''The Oklahoma City Journal Record.'' Retrieved on August 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both cases were settled out of court.

In 2003, [[Mexico]]'s antitrust agency, the Federal Competition Commission, investigated Walmart for &quot;monopolistic practices&quot; prompted by charges that the retailer pressured suppliers to sell goods below cost or at prices significantly less than those available to other stores.  Mexican authorities found no wrong-doing on the part of Walmart.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer.

Walmart won appeal of the ruling, then the German Supreme Court overturned the appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;German High Court&quot;/&gt;  Walmart has since sold its stores in Germany.

Walmart has been accused of using [[monopsony]] power to force its suppliers into self-defeating practices. For example, Barry C. Lynn, a senior fellow at the [[New America Foundation]] (a think tank), argues that Walmart's constant demand for lower prices caused [[Kraft Foods]] to &quot;shut down thirty-nine plants, to let go [of] 13,500 workers, and to eliminate a quarter of its products.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn,BC&quot;/&gt; Kraft was unable to compete with other suppliers and claims the cost of production had gone up due to higher energy and raw material costs.  Lynn argues that in a [[free market]], Kraft could have passed those costs on to its distributors and ultimately consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn,BC&quot;&gt;Lynn, Barry C.

For example, most Walmart store pharmacies fill many generic prescriptions for $4 for a month's supply.  However, in California and ten other states, complaints from other pharmacies have resulted in Walmart being required to charge at least $9 for a month's supply of certain drugs.&lt;ref&gt;(November 30, 2006). &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/business/30pharmacy.html?_r=1&amp;ref=health&amp;oref=slogin Side Effects at the Pharmacy]&quot;.

The 2010 remodelings of their smaller stores shifting emphasis away from non-grocery products towards carrying grocery items carried by their supercenters, has created a small backlash amongst some customers.  The smaller and larger sizes in the adult clothing were discontinued as well as other available styles, forcing adult customers to look for clothing in
the children's section, or shop with more expensive specialty &quot;Big and Tall&quot; stores for basic items such as jeans. Their popular Wrangler and Faded Glory brands are not readily available through their on-line stores in the larger sizes, causing many of their customers to feel that Walmart has abandoned their needs.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The incomplete labeling system of the Great Value product line, to the dismay of consumers, usually does not list location of manufacture of the product.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

== Employee and labor relations ==
With close to two million employees worldwide, [[Walmart]] has faced a torrent of lawsuits and issues with regards to its workforce. These issues involve [[wage|low wages]], [[Occupational safety and health|poor working conditions]], inadequate [[health care]], as well as issues involving the company's strong [[trade union|anti-union]] policies. Critics point to Walmart's  high [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] rate as evidence of an unhappy workforce, although other factors may be involved. Approximately 70% of its employees leave within the first year.&lt;ref name=&quot;storewars&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/itvs/storewars/stores3.html Store Wars: When Walmart Comes to Town].&quot; ''[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].'' Retrieved on February 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the turnover rate the company still is able to affect unemployment rates. This was found in a study by Oklahoma State University which states, &quot;Walmart is found to have substantially lowered the relative unemployment rates of blacks in those counties where it is present, but to have had only a limited impact on relative incomes after the influences of other socio-economic variables were taken into account.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Keil, Stanley R., Spector, Lee C.

=== Wages ===
The activist group ''Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy'' (LAANE) said &quot;in 2006 Walmart reports that full time hourly associates received, on average, $10.11 an hour.&quot;  It further calculated that working 34 hours per week an employee earns $17,874 per year and claimed that is about twenty percent less than the average retail worker.  (The number of hours the &quot;average retail worker&quot; worked was not specified.) The report from LAANE further opines that this pay is &quot;over $10,000 less than what the average two-person family needs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LAANEstudy&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.communitybenefits.org/article.php?id=757]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walmart managers are judged, in part, based on their ability to control payroll costs.  Some say this puts extra pressure on higher-paid workers to be more productive.&lt;ref name=&quot;payrollcosts&quot;&gt;Tejada, Carlos; Gary McWilliams.

By contrast, Walmart insists its wages are generally in line with the current local market in retail labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walmartfacts.com/articles/4382.aspx |title=Walmart Increases Start Rates at 1,200 Facilities |publisher=Walmart Facts |date=2006-08-07 |accessdate=2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; although direct comparisons are complicated because Walmart employs more part time workers, and the company's more extensive training, supervision, and automation provides opportunity to workers with little or no experience or skills, which may account for wage differences.  Walmart grants &quot;full time&quot; benefits to those working as little as 34 hours per week, but does not limit workers to just 34 hours per week. The company does control labor costs by such ways as discouraging overtime, and by the use of &quot;off the clock&quot; labor. There have been numerous lawsuits against Walmart by former employees because of this problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://action.walmartwatch.com/page/-/Walmart%20Wage%20and%20Hour%20Settlement.pdf - Walmart Wage and Hour Settlement].

In August 2006, Walmart announced that it would roll out an average pay increase of 6% for all new hires at 1,200 U.S. Walmart and Sam's Club locations, but the same time would institute pay caps on veteran workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;payincrease&quot;&gt;Staff Writer.

He was sentenced to five years probation and required to pay a $50,000 fine and $411,000 in restitution to Walmart and the Internal Revenue Service. A U.S. attorney has stated that no evidence was found to back up Coughlin's initial claims, and Walmart continues to deny the existence of the anti-union program, though Coughlin himself apparently restated those claims to reporters after his sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/11/AR2006081100547.html 'Former Walmart Exec Sentenced for Theft'].&quot; ''Washington Post.''

== Imports and globalization ==
As a large customer to most of its vendors, Walmart openly uses its bargaining power to bring lower prices to attract its customers.  The company negotiates lower prices from vendors.  For certain basic products, Walmart &quot;has a clear policy&quot; that prices go down from year to year.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastco&quot;&gt;Fishman, Charles. &quot;[http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/77/walmart.html The Walmart You Don't Know].&quot; ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]].''

In the mid-1990s, [[Walmart]] had a &quot;Buy American&quot; campaign. Yet by 2005, about 60% of [[Walmart]]'s merchandise was imported, compared to 6% in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; In 2004, Walmart spent $18 billion on Chinese products alone, and if it were an individual economy, the company would rank as China's eighth largest trading partner, ahead of Russia, Australia, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Jingjing, Jiang. &quot;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-11/29/content_395728.htm Walmart's China inventory to hit US$18b this year].&quot; ''[[China Daily]].''

=== Overseas labor concerns ===
Walmart has been criticized for not providing adequate supervision of its foreign suppliers. It has also been criticized for using [[sweatshop]]s and prison labor. For example, in 1995, Chinese dissident [[Harry Wu]] charged that Walmart was contracting [[prison labor]] in [[Guangdong Province]]. However, Walmart says it does not use prison labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;palast&quot;&gt;Palast, Gregory. &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,,288760,00.html Praise Uncle Sam and pass the 18p an hour].&quot; ''[[The Guardian]].'' June 20, 1999. Retrieved on August 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports of teenagers in [[Bangladesh]] working in sweatshops 80 hours per week at $0.14 per hour, for Walmart supplier [[Beximco]]. The documentary film ''[[Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price]]'' shows images of factories that produce goods for Walmart that appear in poor condition, and factory workers subject to abuse and conditions the documentary producers consider inhumane.

According to Walmart and many self-described advocates of [[free trade]], comparisons of wage levels between vastly different countries is not a useful way to assess the fairness of a trade policy. The company also points out that wages paid to overseas workers are comparable to or exceed local prevailing wages. In that case, the company claims that the overseas manufacturing jobs it creates are often an improvement in the quality of life for its employees. They have also drawn attention to the fact that factory jobs with its suppliers are often safer and healthier than local alternatives, which may include prostitution, the drug trade, or scavenging.

[[Walmart]] currently uses monitoring which critics say is inadequate and &quot;leaves outsiders unable to verify&quot; conditions. Since Walmart will not release its audits or factory names, outside organizations are left to simply take Walmart's word.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Aaron. &quot;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_21/b3934103.htm A Major Swipe At Sweatshops].&quot; ''[[Business Week]].'' May 23, 2005. Retrieved on August 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics suggest an agency such as [[Social Accountability International]] or the [[Fair Labor Association]] should do the monitoring. In 2004, Walmart began working with Business for Social Responsibility, a [[San Francisco]], California-based [[nonprofit organization]], to reach out to groups active in monitoring overseas plants.&lt;ref&gt;Berner, Robert. &quot;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2005/nf20050922_6448_db016.htm Can Walmart Wear a White Hat?].&quot; ''[[Business Week]].''

In June 2006, Walmart was excluded from the investment portfolio of [[The Government Pension Fund of Norway]], which held stock values of about US$ 430 million in the company, due to a [[social audit]] into alleged labor rights violations in Walmart operations in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Africa, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fin/Press-Center/Press-releases/2006/Two-companies---Walmart-and-Freeport---.html?id=104396&amp;epslanguage=EN-GB| title=Two companies - Walmart and Freeport - are being excluded from the Norwegian Government Pension Fund â Globalâs investment universe |author=[[Norwegian Ministry of Finance]] |date=2006-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Walmart did not respond to questions from the fund's auditors, it later claimed the decision &quot;[doesn't] appear to be based on complete information&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/24/magazines/fortune/NorwaytoWMT.fortune/index.htm| title=Norway to Walmart: We don't want your shares |author=Vivienne Walt, [[Fortune Magazine]] |date=2006-07-24 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product selection ==
[[Walmart]]'s product selection has been criticized by some groups in the past, primarily as viewed as a promotion of a particular ideology or as a response to its original rural, religious and conservative target market. In 2003, Walmart removed certain [[men's magazines]] from its shelves, such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]],'' citing customer complaints regarding their racy content.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://money.cnn.com/2003/05/06/news/companies/walmart_mags/ Walmart banishes bawdy mags].&quot; ''[[CNN]].'' May 6, 2003. Retrieved on September 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, it decided to partly obscure the covers of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', ''[[Marie Claire]]'', and ''[[Redbook]]'' on store shelves due to &quot;customer concerns&quot;, and refused to stock an issue of [[Sports Illustrated]]'s swimsuit special because it took exception to one photograph. It has also refused to sell the December 2011 issue of [[WWE Magazine]] due to its controversial cover depicting [[The Rock]] doused with fire.&lt;ref&gt;Younge, Gary. &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1020794,00.html When Walmart comes to town]&quot;. ''[[The Guardian]]''. August 18, 2003. Retrieved on September 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, Walmart also has not carried music albums marked with the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s (RIAA's) [[Parental Advisory|Parental Advisory Label]] (contradictory to the allowance of R-rated movies and video games rated Mature), although it carries edited versions of such albums, with obscenities removed or overdubbed with less offensive lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Schneid, Scott. &quot;[http://www.familymediaguide.com/features/articles/Ratings_Soup__Music_II-195.html Ratings Soup â Music II].&quot; ''[http://www.familymediaguide.com/ Family Media Guide].'' July 26, 2005. Retrieved on September 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In one example in 2005, Walmart rejected the original cover of country singer [[Willie Nelson]]'s [[reggae]] album, ''[[Countryman (album)|Countryman]],'' which featured [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] leaves, in an apparent pro-marijuana statement. To satisfy Walmart, the record label, [[Lost Highway Records]], issued the album with an alternative cover, without recalling the original cover. Walmart has never carried [[Marilyn Manson]] albums, solely because of the controversy surrounding the group, but recently began selling [[Nine Inch Nails]] albums after rejecting them for years.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Sarah. &quot;[http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,16920,00.html?tnews Walmart Tweaks Willie's Reggae].&quot; ''[[E!]]'' July 12, 2005. Retrieved on September 29, 2006. {{dead link| date=June 2010 | bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, some albums that do not carry &quot;Parental Advisory&quot; stickers, include profanities and are not edited. Such albums include [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and [[Arctic Monkeys]]' ''[[Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]]''. In 2009 [[Green Day]] refused to make an edited version of their album [[21st Century Breakdown]] for Walmart, with frontman [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] claiming &quot;You feel like you're in 1953 or something&quot;, thus the album is not carried by Walmart stores. However, Walmart's policy on carrying albums with the Parental Advisory Label seems to vary by country, as albums containing the label can be found in Canadian Walmart stores, for example.

In 1999, Walmart announced that it would not stock [[emergency contraception]] pills in its pharmacies, not citing any particular reasons except for a &quot;business decision&quot; that was made earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;morningafter&quot;&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/05/14/health/main47233.shtml Walmart: No Morning-After Pill].&quot; ''[[CBS News]].''

Walmart has also been criticized for selling some controversial products. For example, in 2004 Walmart carried the [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] hoax&lt;ref name=&quot;Zion_hoax&quot;&gt;&quot;A Hoax of Hate&quot; ''Jewish Virtual Library'' [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/hoax.html] Retrieved on April 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' in its online catalogue and Walmart's online product description suggested the text might be genuine{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. The Jewish civil rights organization [[Anti-Defamation League]] wrote to the President of Walmart on September 2008 noting the text, &quot;has been the major weapon in the arsenals of anti-Semites around the world,&quot; and called on Walmart to, &quot;unequivocally state the nature of the book and to disassociate itself from any endorsement of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League [http://www.adl.org/misc/Walmart-protocols-ltr.asp {{Dead link|date=August 2011}} &quot;Letter to Walmart RE: The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;] September 21, 2008, Retrieved on February 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Walmart stopped selling the book shortly thereafter.

In October 2004, Walmart canceled its order for ''[[The Daily Show]]'s'' ''[[America (The Book)]]'' after discovering a page that depicts each [[US Supreme Court]] judge nude. A week later, it returned copies of comedian [[George Carlin]]'s ''[[When Will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops?]],'' with a cover recreating [[The Last Supper]] with Jesus' seat empty and Carlin (an avowed atheist) seated next to it. The company claimed that the copies were shipped to it by mistake and a Walmart spokeswoman said she did not &quot;believe this particular product would appeal&quot; to its customer base.&lt;ref&gt;Staff Writer. &quot;[http://money.cnn.com/2004/10/28/news/newsmakers/walmart_carlin/ Carlin's no joke for Walmart].&quot; ''[[CNN]].''

In January 2006, Walmart was criticized for the recommendation system on its website which suggested that some black-related DVDs, such as ''[[Introducing Dorothy Dandridge]]'' and documentaries on Baptist minister and civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] were similar to the ''[[Planet of the Apes (TV series)|Planet of the Apes]]'' television series DVD box set. It quickly corrected the page, saying that it was a software glitch, but ultimately blamed the matter on human error.&lt;ref&gt;Mui, Ylan Q. &quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/06/AR2006010601875.html Walmart Blames Web Site Incident on Employee's Error].&quot; ''[[The Washington Post]].''

== Taxes ==
Until the mid-1990s, Walmart took out [[corporate-owned life insurance]] policies on its employees including &quot;low-level&quot; employees such as janitors, cashiers, and stockers. This type of insurance is usually purchased to cover a company against financial loss when a high-ranking employee (i.e. management) dies, and is usually known as &quot;Key Man Insurance.&quot;  Critics derided Walmart as buying what they called &quot;Dead Peasants Insurance&quot; or &quot;Janitor Insurance.&quot;  Critics, as well as the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]], charge that the company was trying to profit from the deaths of its employees, and take advantage of the tax law which allowed it to deduct the premiums.  The practice was stopped in the mid-1990s when the federal government closed the tax deduction and began to pursue Walmart for back taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Frank. &quot;[http://fsnews.findlaw.com/articles/andrews/bf/dcl/20050908/20050908walmart.html Walmart Gambled, Lost $1.3B on 'Dead Peasant' Policies, Insurers Say].&quot; ''Andrews Publications.''
