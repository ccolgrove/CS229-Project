The '''Vulcan salute''' is a [[hand gesture]] consisting of a raised hand, palm forward with the [[finger]]s parted between the middle and [[ring finger]], and the thumb extended. Often, the famous line, &quot;'''Live long and prosper'''&quot;, is said after it.  The salute was devised and popularised by [[Leonard Nimoy]], who portrayed the half-[[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] character [[Spock|Mr. Spock]] on [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original ''Star Trek'' television series]] in the late 1960s.

==Overview==
The Vulcan salute first appeared in 1967 on the ''Star Trek'' second season opening episode, &quot;[[Amok Time]]&quot;. The gesture famously has a reputation for being difficult to make without practice or the covert pre-positioning of the fingers, and actors on the original show reportedly had to position their fingers off-screen with the other hand before raising their hand into frame. This reputation may stem from variations in individuals' [[manual dexterity]]. This reputation is parodied somewhat in the motion picture ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' when [[Zefram Cochrane]], upon meeting a Vulcan for the first time in human history, is unable to return the Vulcan salute gesture and instead shakes the Vulcan's hand.

In his autobiography ''[[I Am Not Spock]]'', Nimoy wrote that he based it on the [[Priestly Blessing]] performed by [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Kohen|Kohanim]] with both hands, thumb to thumb in this same position, representing the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] letter [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] (×©), which has three upward strokes similar to the position of the thumb and fingers in the salute. The letter Shin here stands for Shaddai, meaning &quot;Almighty (God)&quot;.  Nimoy wrote that when he was a child, his grandfather took him to an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] synagogue.  There he saw the blessing performed and was very impressed by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/05/leonard-nimoy-star-trek-fans-can-be-scary.html#more|title=Leonard Nimoy: 'Star Trek' fans can be scary |publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accompanying spoken blessing, &quot;''Live long and prosper''&quot; (''Dif-tor heh smusma'' in [[Vulcan (Star Trek)#Language|Vulcan language]] as spoken in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'') also appeared for the first time in &quot;[[Amok Time]]&quot;, scripted by [[Theodore Sturgeon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfsite.com/gary/stur01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The less-known reply is &quot;Peace and long life.&quot; This format is similar to common [[Middle East]]ern greetings (''[[As-Salamu Alaykum|Salaam alaykum]]'' in Arabic and ''[[Shalom aleichem]]'' in Hebrew), meaning &quot;peace be upon you&quot;, and its reply, &quot;upon you be peace&quot;. An even more ancient variation can be found with the Ancient Egyptians: the blessing ''[[ankh wedja seneb]]'', usually translated as &quot;may he live, be prosperous, be healthy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The exact translation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics phrase into English is somewhat open to interpretation, however &quot;life&quot;, &quot;prosperity&quot; and &quot;health&quot; are the three symbols used in the formula. The [[Something Awful]] comedy website translates it as &quot;Live long&quot;..[http://www.somethingawful.com/d/comedy-goldmine/heiroglyphs.php?page=2], while the more academic source (Gardiner, Alan (1957). ''Egyptian Grammar''. Griffith Institute, Ashmolean Museum, page 239) gives it as &quot;may he live, be prosperous, be healthy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' contains the line, &quot;Live and be prosperous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Act V. Sc iii. Romeo and Juliet.  Shakespeare, William. [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] Edition. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
