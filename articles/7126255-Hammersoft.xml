'''''BECK Tribute - Greatful Sound''''' was released as a promotional collectible before the [[BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad|Beck]] anime had been seriously considered, and thus features assorted semi-underground Japanese bands but no actual songs from the manga. The misspelled album title is intentional - &quot;Greatful Sound&quot; is a music festival featured in the manga and anime. This is most likely little more than an example of [[Engrish]], common in anime and manga - BECK especially.
#[[Choke Sleeper]] - Leave Me Alone
#[[Nice Marbles]] - Furouto
#[[Smorgas]] - Dead Man
#[[Loop-Line]] - Flow
#[[Badfish]] - Up Set Vibration
#[[Beratrek]] with POLY-1 from [[Polysics]] - Let's Groove or die
#[[54 Nude Honeys]] - Fat Liver
#[[Bazra]] - Yureru
#[[Coaltar of the Deepers]] - h.s.k.s.
#[[Rumtag]] - Melody
