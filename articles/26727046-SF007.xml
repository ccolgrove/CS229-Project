The '''Samsung Galaxy S''' is an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[smartphone]] that was announced by Samsung in March 2010.

==Reception==

The phone was criticized by some reviewers for sub-par GPS performance. Anandtech, reviewing the Epic 4G variant, said &quot;the phone will take an inordinate amount of time to determine your actual location, and/or it wonât pinpoint your location very accurately.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

==Hardware==
=== Processor ===
The Samsung Galaxy S used the Samsung S5PC110 processor.&lt;ref name=&quot;EETimes&quot;/&gt; This processor combined a 45&amp;nbsp;nm 1&amp;nbsp;GHz [[ARM Cortex-A8]] based [[CPU]] core with a [[PowerVR]] SGX 540 [[GPU]] made by [[Imagination Technologies]] which supported [[OpenGL ES]] 1.1/2.0&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/powervr-graphics.asp|title=POWERVR Graphics|author=Imagination Technologies Ltd.|accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was capable of up to &lt;!-- this figure is in the &quot;GPUtriangle&quot; source, please provide a reliable source if you change this figure --&gt;20 million triangles per second.&lt;ref name=&quot;GPUtriangle&quot;/&gt; The CPU core, code-named &quot;Hummingbird,&quot; was co-developed by [[Samsung]] and [[Intrinsity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/newsView.do?news_id=1030|title=SAMSUNG and Intrinsity Jointly Develop the World's Fastest ARM Cortex-A8 Processor Based Mobile Core in 45 Nanometer Low Power Process|author=Samsung|date=27 July 2009|accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This processor was subsequently renamed to the [[Samsung Exynos#Exynos 3110| Samsung Exynos 3110]] in October 2011.{{fact|date=November 2011}}

=== Memory ===

The Samsung Galaxy S has 512&amp;nbsp;MB of LPDDR2 RAM ([[Mobile DDR]]). Some variants also come with either 8&amp;nbsp;GB or 16&amp;nbsp;GB of OneNAND memory combined in a [[Package on package|package-on-package]] stack with the processor. An external [[microSD]] card slot supports up to 32&amp;nbsp;GB of additional storage memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;EETimes&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
===User interface===
The phone employs the latest proprietary Samsung TouchWiz 3.0 user interface. Unlike TouchWiz 3.0 on the Samsung Wave, it allows up to seven homescreens. However, different from other Android user interfaces, TouchWiz 3.0 allows users to add, delete and rearrange homescreens. The program launcher is also different from other Android user interfaces in that it has an [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]-like program menu which allows customization of shortcuts. In addition, three of the four shortcuts at the bottom of the screen can also be customized.

The Epic 4G features a specialized version of TouchWiz based on TouchWiz 2.5. Because of the Epic 4G's QWERTY slide-out keyboard, the homescreen needed to be able to rotate into landscape mode, and accordingly several key features and applications are absent on the Epic. TouchWiz 3.0 devices do not support this feature, and because of that difference, the Epic 4G ships with a heavily modified TouchWiz 2.5 interface. The customization of homescreens, as well as several other features found on TouchWiz 3.0 devices like the Vibrant, Captivate, and Fascinate, is not supported in the version of TouchWiz that ships on the Epic 4G.

The most important aspect of all three generations of TouchWiz is the widget interface. The most prominent widgets that come with the Galaxy S are the Daily Briefing, weather clock and the Buddies Now widget. In addition to Samsung widgets, standard Android widgets can be added and removed from the homescreens.

===Bundled applications===
Other provided software includes the [[Layar]] Reality Browser, a program that visualizes GPS direction, and Aldiko, an ebook reader. The phone also comes with various upgraded versions of software that came with Samsung's previous generation of smartphones (such as i8910HD and i8000 Omnia II).

===Media support===
The Galaxy S comes with support for many multimedia file formats, including audio codecs ([[FLAC]], [[WAV]], [[Vorbis]], [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[AAC+]], [[eAAC+]], [[WMA]], [[AMR-NB]], [[AMR-WB]], [[MID]], [[AC3]], [[XMF]]), video codecs ([[mpeg4]], [[H.264]], [[H.263]], [[Sorenson codec]], [[DivX HD]]/ [[XviD]], [[VC-1]]) and video formats ([[3GP]] ([[MPEG-4]]), [[WMV]] ([[Advanced Systems Format]]), [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] ([[divx]]), [[Matroska|MKV]], [[FLV]]).

===Updates===
The [[Android (operating system) | Android ]] version is [[mobile network operator | network operator]] dependent and will normally be upgraded over the air, but this will not occur when a handset is configured for one [[mobile network operator | network operator]] but operated on another network.{{fact|date=July 2011}} The latest official [[Android (operating system) | Android ]] version for a handset configured for any carrier is available using the [[Samsung Kies]] application.{{fact|date=July 2011}}  There are also third party versions of Android available for the Galaxy S, for example [http://www.darkyrom.com/ Darky's Rom], but installing them may void the owner's warranty.{{fact|date=July 2011}}.

Samsung is willing to freely upgrade those early devices which do not update via Kies. In the UK at least any Galaxy S should be upgradable to Android 2.3.3.

====Android 2.2 upgrade====
[[File:Android Market.jpg|thumb|Android Market on Samsung Galaxy S.]]
When launched, the Galaxy S had Android 2.1 (&quot;[[Android_(operating_system)#Version_history|Eclair]]&quot;) installed. An official upgrade to Android 2.2 (&quot;[[Android_(operating_system)#Version_history|Froyo]]&quot;) began rolling out worldwide in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;

Verizon's Fascinate was upgraded to Android 2.2 in April 2011. Verizon's Continuum variant, however, remains on Android 2.1.

====Android 2.3 upgrade====
An Android 2.3 (&quot;[[Android_(operating_system)#Version_history|Gingerbread]]&quot;) update became available for Nordic countries, The Netherlands and Germany on April 16, 2011. The update reached UK, Pakistan, India and HongKong by the end of May, 2011. Singapore received the update in June. Australia received the update in August. For other countries it is expected to be available later. The Samsung Epic for Sprint started receiving the Gingerbread update on November 9, 2011 and the update was released for the Samsung Galaxy S 4G on November 15. Currently, the Verizon network is field-testing its gingerbread update for the Samsung Fascinate. As of December 1, 2011, the Samsung Fascinate has been updated to Gingerbread 2.3 ([http://www.droid-life.com/2011/12/01/samsung-fascinate-gingerbread-update-eh03-ready-possibly-rolling-out-now/ Droid-Life]).

}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third Android 2.x phone officially supported on the T-Mobile network (after the Nexus One and MyTouch 3G Slide). The Vibrant supports Quad-band GSM operations as well as the T-Mobile 3G network in the UMTS Band IV ([[Advanced Wireless Services|AWS]], 1700/2100) and also in the UMTS Band I (2100) / II (1900) where coverage and service is available (for example, the Vibrant will work with AT&amp;T 3G where that carrier operates services on the 1,900&amp;nbsp;MHz band). This variant, however, does not operate in 3G in the UMTS Band V (850) because its hardware is not configured for that frequency. It includes 16 GB of internal flash memory, it lacks a front-facing camera and LED flash. The price was $199 with a new, two-year contract, or less through some distributors. T-Mobile also bundled the film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', preloaded onto a microSD card, with the phone.&lt;ref&gt;
