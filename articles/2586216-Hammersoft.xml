&quot;'''7'''&quot; is a song by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[The New Power Generation]], from the 1992 ''[[Love Symbol Album]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Prince-The-New-Power-Generation-7/master/97256 |title=Prince And The New Power Generation* - 7 at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=2004-10-16 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a sample of the 1967 [[Otis Redding]] and [[Carla Thomas]] duet, &quot;[[Tramp (song)|Tramp]]&quot;.

==Music video==
The video was shot on February 27, 1992. It begins with [[Mayte Garcia|Mayte]] whispering &quot;imagine&quot; in Prince's ear, in the position they are in on the single cover. A scene from ''[[3 Chains o' Gold]]'' is shown as well. It features Mayte belly-dancing. The video set is pictured on the album cover, along with a still shot from the video. There are seven little girls wearing yellow belly-dancing outfits almost identical to Mayte's. There are seven little boys wearing black outfits and eyebands identical to Prince's. This video is also notable for Mayte dancing with a sword on her head, which she would later do in live performances.

==Chart performance==
The most successful single from the album in the U.S., &quot;'''7'''&quot; was most successful on the Top 40 Pop/Mainstream charts, where it earned a #3 placement, and coincidentally the single peaked at #7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. It performed respectably on the Rhythmic charts (#19). However, it was less popular with R&amp;B/Hip Hop radio, stalling at #61. In the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts the song peaked at #12.

The single performed well in the U.K., rising as high as #27, but falling short of the success of the previous two releases.
