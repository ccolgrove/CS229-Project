'''Maryland Day''' is a legal [[holiday]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]].  It is observed on the [[anniversary]] of the March 25, 1634, landing of settlers in the [[Province of Maryland]].  On this day settlers from ''The Ark'' and ''The Dove'' first stepped foot onto Maryland soil, at [[St. Clement's Island]] in the [[Potomac River]].  The colony was granted to [[CÃ¦cilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]] two years prior by [[Charles I of England]].  In thanksgiving for the safe landing, [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Father [[Andrew White (Missionary)|Andrew White]] celebrated [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] for the colonists, perhaps for the first time ever in this part of the world.  The landing coincided with the [[Annunciation|Feast of the Annunciation]], a holy day honoring [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Mary]], and the start of the new year in England's legal calendar (prior to 1752).

The holiday began in 1903, the date chosen by the state board of education to honor Maryland history.  In 1916, the legislature authorized Maryland Day as a legal holiday (Chapter 633, Acts of 1916).
