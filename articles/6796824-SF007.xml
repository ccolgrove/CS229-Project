'''Virtual currency''' (or '''in-game currency''' depending on environment) is used to purchase [[virtual goods]] within a variety of online communities; which include [[social networking]] websites, [[virtual worlds]] and [[online game|online gaming]] sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat1&quot;&gt;http://howtostartasocialnetwork.com/2009/12/07/virtual-currencies-and-virtual-goods-definitions-and-revenue-streams-in-social-networks/&lt;/ref&gt;
A key revenue driver within [[social media]], virtual currencies are specific within each game and are used to purchase in-game goods. Characters or [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s in virtual worlds own things within the context of the virtual world and users will collect each games' virtual currency to purchase land, supplies and various items used to enhance their status and add points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat1&quot;/&gt; Some virtual currencies are [[Time-based currency|time-based]], relying upon measurement of in-game achievements in order to accrue exchangeable points.

The word '''virtual currency''' or '''cyber currency''' is also often used, in a more broad sense, to indicate electronic money, that is not contractually backed by tangible assets nor by legal tender laws, and which is not a tangible commodity itself. Examples are [[peer-to-peer]] crypto-currencies like [[bitcoin]] and the above mentioned in-game currencies that are backed by virtual goods.

== Business ==

[[Virtual goods]] have been in popular demand, driving revenue in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] for years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat2&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/07/technology/internet/07virtual.html | work=The New York Times | title=Virtual Goods Start Bringing Real Paydays | date=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat3&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8320184.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sales of virtual goods boom in US | date=22 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the [[United States]] had only devout gamers spending money on virtual goods; driven by the popularity of widely appealing games for social networks such as [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]], this is rapidly changing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat2&quot;/&gt;  [[Zynga]] reported that direct purchases of virtual currency and goods accounted for most of its more than $100 million in revenue for 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat2&quot;/&gt;

== Gamer currency ==

Players of some massively multiplayer online games ([[MMOG]]s) spend real money on virtual currency to purchase swords, houses and magic wands for their in-game avatars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat3&quot;/&gt; In Restaurant City, a game by [[Playfish]], 18 million active users manage their own cafÃ©, while 62 million users cultivate a farm and purchase game dollars towards additions to their farm in [[Zynga]]âs [[FarmVille]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cici Wirachmat3&quot;/&gt;

Virtual currency systems such as [[Hub Culture]]'s [[Ven (currency)|Ven]] are used beyond gaming to enable trade and purchase of real world items, inventory and knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virtual Money&quot;&gt;http://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/02/ff_futureofmoney/2/&lt;/ref&gt; Ven is the first virtual currency to have been used in commodity and carbon credit trades.&lt;ref name= &quot;Commodity Trades&quot;&gt;http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=22475/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In others, such as [[Empire Avenue]], the virtual currency can only be used to invest in other registered members or purchase in-game ads and services while allowing the purchase of virtual currency via PayPal US dollars.&lt;ref name=&quot;empireavenue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenextweb.com/apps/2010/07/26/empire-avenue-the-stockmarket-where-youre-for-sale-invites/|title=Empire Avenue, the stockmarket where YOUâRE for sale|accessdate=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
