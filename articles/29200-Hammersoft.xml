'''Seattle University (SU)''' is a [[Jesuit]] Catholic university located in the [[First Hill, Seattle|First Hill]] neighborhood of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.seattleu.edu/Office_and_Administration/Admission/Seattle_Living/Housing.xml |title=&quot;'&amp;#39;'First Hill'&amp;#39;'. The home of our main campus and known to many as &quot;Pill Hill,&quot; it is also the site of several hospitals, many of them nationally recognized. The area earned its name because it was one of the first established neighborhoods in Seattle.&quot; Retrieved 10 NOV 2010 |publisher=Law.seattleu.edu |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yelp.com/biz/seattle-university-seattle-2 |title=Yelp. &quot;'&amp;#39;Category: Colleges &amp; Universities'&amp;#39;, 900 Broadway, Seattle, WA 98122.

SU is the largest independent university in the Northwest US, with over 7,500 students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs within eight schools, and is one of 28 member institutions of the [[Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities]]. ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', in its &quot;Best Colleges 2011,&quot; ranked Seattle University 6th out of schools in the West that offer a full range of master's and undergraduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/seattle-wa/seattle-university-3790 |title=Seattle University &amp;#124; Best College |publisher=usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1891, Fathers Victor Garrand, S.J., and Adrian Sweere, S.J., took over a small parish near downtown Seattle at Broadway and Madison. At first, the school was named after the surrounding Immaculate Conception parish and did not offer higher education. In 1898, the school was named Seattle College after both the city and [[Chief Seattle]], and it granted its first bachelor's degrees 11 years later. Initially, the school served as both a high school and college. From 1919 to 1931, the college moved to Interlaken Blvd, but in 1931 it returned to First Hill permanently. In 1931, Seattle College created a &quot;night school&quot; for women in order to allow them to attend; becoming coeducational was a highly controversial decision at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleu.edu/history/section2.html |title=1891â1919: Early Days in Seattle â Seattle University: A History of Excellence |publisher=Seattleu.edu |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleu.edu/history/section3.html |title=1919â1933: Off and On Broadway â Seattle University: A History of Excellence |publisher=Seattleu.edu |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Seattle College changed its name to Seattle University under Father Albert A. Lemieux, S.J. In 1993, the [[Seattle University School of Law]] was established through purchase of the Law School from the [[University of Puget Sound]] in [[Tacoma, Washington]].  In 1999 the School of Law moved to the Seattle campus.

In 2009, SU completed the largest capital campaign in the university's history, raising almost $169 million and surpassing the original campaign goal by almost $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleu.edu/campaign/ |title=Seattle University â Alumni Relations â Home |publisher=Seattleu.edu |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign has resulted in new scholarships for students, academic programs and professorships, a fitness complex, an arts center and more. The centerpiece of the capital projects is the $56 million Lemieux Library and McGoldrick Learning Commons, completed in fall 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seattle University (add vcard to contacts) |url=http://www.seattleu.edu/university_news.aspx?id=48795 |title=University News â Seattle University |publisher=Seattleu.edu |date=September 10, 2009 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community Investment==
Investing and partnering with Seattle and the SU neighborhood are part of the Jesuit Catholic mission of education for service and social justice. More than 3,000 studentsâthree out of every fourâtake part in at least one for-credit âservice learningâ class by the time that they graduate; nearly 45 percent participate in a service-learning class in any given year. This translates to 185,000 hours, the equivalent of more than 80 full-time workers or $6 million. By comparison, on a national level only about one-third of college students volunteer, according to the Corporation for National &amp; Community Service.

The number of service learning courses at SU has nearly doubled since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleu.edu/CSCE/Inner.aspx?id=34732 |title=Seattle University â Center for Service and Community Engagement â Letter from the Director |publisher=Seattleu.edu |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-third of service-learning students continue their community work even after their class has ended and they've earned a grade. Many students continue serving after graduation through an SU program called Magis:Alumni Committed for Mission. In the past two years, nearly 100 alumni have participated in Magis efforts such as the Alumni Mexico Mission Trek and the annual Serve Seattle project. And in each of the past three years, at least a dozen graduates have gone into full-time service with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, the Peace Corps and Teach for America.

Because SU is part of Seattle's urban hub, students have easy access to a number of areas that offer a wide variety of service learning opportunities, including the Central District, the International District and Pioneer Square.

The economic impact of SU in the Seattle area in 2008 was $580.4 million. This figure is drawn from the total spending by the university, its students and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleu.edu/csce/default.aspx?id=34720 |title=Seattle University â Center for Service and Community Engagement â Home |publisher=Seattleu.edu |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattleu.edu/uploadedFiles/GCA/SU_BenefitstoCommunityReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental Sustainability==
Among Seattle University's many environmental undertakings, there are projects ranging from composting initiatives to water conservation. There are also solar panels on buildings, and a central recycling yard with an extensive recycling program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.seattleu.edu/sustainability/initiatives.aspx |title=Seattle University |publisher=.seattleu.edu |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has been composting since 1995, and in 2003 it built the first composting facility in the state on an urban campus. The University's Grounds Department is committed to fostering an organic, sustainable and environmentally friendly campus that functions as an urban wildlife sanctuary. 

SU received the Sustainability Innovator Award in 2007 from the Sustainable Endowments Institute for SU's pre-consumer food waste composting program and the Green Washington Award in 2008 from Washington CEO Magazine for SU's sustainable landscape practices and pre-consumer food waste composting program.&lt;ref name=&quot;seattleu.edu&quot;/&gt; The Princeton Review's 2009 Green Rating gave the school a 97 out of a possible 99.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seattle University (add vcard to contacts) |url=http://www.seattleu.edu/university_news.aspx?id=41590 |title=University News â Seattle University |publisher=Seattleu.edu |date=August 7, 2008 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SU's move to a pesticide-free campus began in the early 1980s when Ciscoe Morris, now a local gardening celebrity, was head of the SU Grounds Department in the 1980s.  He put a halt to chemical spraying and in its place released more than 20,000 beneficial insects called [[lacewing]]s to eat the aphids that had infested trees on campus. It worked and that led to a whole host of pesticide-free gardening practices.  Cisco began a transformation that has made the university a model for ecological gardening.

Between 1950 and 1971, Seattle University competed as a Division I independent school. In the 1950s, the basketball team was a powerhouse with brothers Johnny and Eddie O'Brien, who led Seattle University as the only team in history to defeat the world famous [[Harlem Globetrotters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/othersports/55228_globe21.shtml Fifty years ago tonight, Seattle U. upset the mighty Globetrotters], accessed January 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, future [[NBA Hall of Fame]]r [[Elgin Baylor]] paced a men's basketball team that advanced to the [[Final Four]] and defeated top-ranked [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State University]] before losing to the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]].  Seattle University was also a leader in the area of racial diversity, with an integrated squad known as âthe United Nations team.â

The success of men's basketball, in addition to men's golf and baseball, continued into to the 1960s with players [[Eddie Miles]], [[Clint Richardson]], and [[Tom Workman]], all of whom went on to successful careers in the NBA.  The 1966 basketball squad led [[Texas Western University]] to its only defeat in a championship season celebrated in the film ''[[Glory Road]]''. In the course of the 1960s, Seattle University produced more NBA players than any other school. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

During that time women's tennis star [[Janet Hopps]] was the first female to be the top-ranked player for both the men and women nationally. In women's golf, Pat Lesser was twice named to the Curtis Cup in the mid-1950s and was later inducted into the State of Washington Sports Hall of Fame.

Before 1980, more than 25 SU baseball players went on to play professionally in both the major and minor leagues.  Men's golf and a [[Tom Gorman (tennis)|Tom Gorman]] -led tennis team were also very strong{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} national programs.  Gorman went on to lead the US Davis Cup team, where he captained a record 18 match wins and one Davis Cup title (1972) as a player and two more Davis Cup championships as a coach (1990 and 1992). 

SU joined the [[West Coast Conference]] in 1971. In 1980, SU left the West Coast Conference and Division I membership and entered the NAIA, where it remained for nearly 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wccsports.cstv.com/school-bio/west-school-bio.html |title=West Coast Conference Official Athletics Site â On Campus |publisher=Wccsports.cstv.com |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, President Fr. Sundborg started restoring the university's NCAA membership. The athletic program moved into Division II in the fall of 2002.  

Currently, the school is reclassifying from [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]. This integration process will take five years and should be complete in 2012â2013. In 2009, the university hired men's basketball coaches [[Cameron Dollar]], former assistant at University of Washington, and women's coach [[Joan Bonvicini]], former University of Arizona coach and one of the winningest women's college basketball coaches. 

In 1938 the mascot switched from the Maroons to the Chieftains.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattleu.edu/history/section4.xml&lt;/ref&gt; The name was selected to honor the college's namesake, Chief Sealth. In 2000 the university changed its mascot to the Redhawks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seattleu.edu/home/news_events/news/news_detail.asp?elYear=2000&amp;elID=521200210924 |title=Seattle University |publisher=Seattleu.edu |date= |accessdate=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
