'''Randall Patrick Munroe''' (born October 17, 1984)&lt;ref name=&quot;facebook.com&quot;/&gt; is an American [[webcomic]] author and former [[NASA]] [[roboticist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/news/2007/11/xkcd | title=Real Geek Heart Beats in Xkcd's Stick Figures | work=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a [[programmer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | id={{issn|0362-4331}} | last = Cohen | first = Noam | title = This Is Funny Only if You Know Unix | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2008-09-25 | date = 2008-05-26 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/26/business/media/26link.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss }}&lt;/ref&gt; best known as the creator of the webcomic ''[[xkcd]]''. He and the webcomic have developed a [[cult following]], and he is one of a small but growing group of [[List of professional webcomic artists|professional webcomic artists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;

== Biography ==
Munroe was a fan of the [[funny pages]] from an early age,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt; starting off with ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=@Google Talks (venue) |date=2007-12-11 |title=Authors@Google: Randall Munroe |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJOS0sV2a24 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |medium=[[Digital video]] |publisher=[[Google]] |location=[[Mountain View, California]] |accessdate=2008-09-25 |time=24:13 |quote=...Calvin and Hobbes was the first comic that I discovered.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from the [[Mathematics and Science High School at Clover Hill|Chesterfield County Mathematics and Science High School at Clover Hill]]: A Renaissance Program, he graduated from [[Christopher Newport University]] in 2006 with a degree in [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xkcd.com/about/ |title=About |accessdate=2008-09-26 |last=Munroe |first=Randall |publisher=xkcd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://universityrelations.cnu.edu/news/2006/05_17_06grads.html|title= 582 students receive diplomas from Christopher Newport University|accessdate=2008-05-30 |author= |date=2006-05-17 |publisher=Christopher Newport University |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611060823/http://universityrelations.cnu.edu/news/2006/05_17_06grads.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munroe worked as an [[independent contractor]] for [[NASA]] at the [[Langley Research Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJOS0sV2a24 |title=Authors@Google: Randall Munroe |accessdate=2008-09-25 |date=2007-12-11 |work=@Google Talks |publisher=[[Google]] |location=[[Mountain View, California]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; before and after his graduation. In October 2006 NASA did not renew his contract&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xkcd.livejournal.com/|title=Authors@LiveJournal: Randall Munroe |accessdate=2010-06-30 |date=2006-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he began to write ''xkcd'' full-time. He now supports himself by the sale of ''xkcd'' related merchandise.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Hat&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Rebecca |last=Fernandez |title=xkcd: A comic strip for the computer geek |url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/025nov06/features/xkcd/ |work=Red Hat Magazine |publisher=[[Red Hat]] |location=[[Raleigh, North Carolina]] |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The webcomic quickly became very popular, garnering up to 70 million hits a month by October 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Adrienne |last=So |title=Real Geek Heart Beats in Xkcd's Stick Figures |url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/theweb/news/2007/11/xkcd |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[CondÃ© Nast Publications]] |location=[[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] |id={{ISSN|1059-1028}} |date=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also toured the [[lecture]] circuit, giving speeches at such places as [[Google]]'s [[Googleplex]] in [[Mountain View, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beyondsatire.us/?q=node/272 |title=Randall Munroe's visit to Google (xkcd) |accessdate=2008-09-25 |last=Spertus |first=Ellen |authorlink=Ellen Spertus |date=2007-12-21 |work=Beyond Satire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, he wrote a check to [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] which used a complex math expression to specify its amount: $0.002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xkcd.com/verizon/ |title=The check }}&lt;/ref&gt; The check was written as a protest against problems a fellow customer experienced with Verizon's billing department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://verizonmath.blogspot.com/ | title = VerizonMath | first = George | last = Vaccaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|May 2008}}, Munroe lived in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;

In October of 2010 Munroe's fiancÃ©e was diagnosed with stage 3 [[breast cancer]]. The diagnosis had a slight effect on the rate of publication of his comic strip, causing him to occasionally be several hours late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/06/30/family-illness/| title= Munroe's Blog post &quot;family illness&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married in September of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/09/12/672/| title= Munroe's Blog post &quot;&lt;3&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''xkcd''  is a [[stick figure]] comic with themes in [[computer science]], [[technology]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[language]], [[pop culture]] and [[Romance (love)|romance]].  

Munroe had originally used xkcd as an instant messaging screenname because he wanted a name without a meaning so he wouldn't eventually grow tired of it. He registered the domain name, but left it idle until he started posting his drawings&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Hat&quot; /&gt; in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=@Google Talks (venue) |date=2007-12-11 |title=Authors@Google: Randall Munroe |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJOS0sV2a24 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |medium=[[Digital video]] |publisher=[[Google]] |location=[[Mountain View, California]] |accessdate=2008-09-25 |time=48:05 |quote= I'm pretty sure I started in September 2005.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comic has a very loyal fanbase. Munroe said, &quot;I think the comic that's gotten me the most feedback is actually the one about the [http://xkcd.com/277/ stoplights]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired&quot; /&gt;

Munroe licenses his creations under the [[Creative Commons]] [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/ attribution-noncommercial 2.5] license, stating that it isn't just about the [[free culture movement]], but that it also makes good business sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Hat&quot; /&gt; His income derives from the sale of [[merchandise]] to his fans, sales consisting of thousands of [[t-shirts]] a month.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot; /&gt;

The popularity of the strip among [[Science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]] resulted in Munroe being nominated for a [[Hugo Award]] for Best Fan Artist in 2011 (although the award for that year ultimately went to [[Brad Foster]]).

== Other projects ==

Munroe is the creator of the websites &quot;BestThing&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bestthing.info | title = bestthing.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Funniest&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thefunniest.info | title = The Funniest}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Cutest&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thecutest.info | title = The Cutest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;The Fairest&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://thefairest.info | title = The Fairest}}&lt;/ref&gt; each of which presents  the user with two options and asks them to choose one over the other.

He started the &quot;WetRiffs&quot; website as a joke, one month after drawing the &quot;Rule 34&quot; comic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://xkcd.com/305/ | title = Rule 34 | work = xkcd | first = Randall | last = Munroe}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;lamenting the lack of guitar-in-the-shower pictures on the internet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wetriffs.com/ |title=Nudity + Guitars + Showers |accessdate=2008-09-26 |last=Munroe |first=Randall |date=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

LimerickDB encourages the creation of new and the collection of old [[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/02/04/limerickdbcom|title=LimerickDB.com|accessdate=2008-09-26|last=Munroe|first=Randall|date=2008-02-04|work=Blag|publisher=xkcd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently he started a [http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing Geohashing wiki] based on one of his comics which contains an [[algorithm]] that generates pseudo-random coordinates around the world every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Main_Page | title = Geohashing Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from maintaining his websites, Munroe also engages in [[kite aerial photography|kite photography]], in which cameras are attached to kites and pictures are then taken of the ground or buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Ben | last = Kuchera | url = http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2007/07/the-joys-of-kite-photography.ars | title = The joys of kite photography | work = [[Ars Technica]] | date = 2 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Radiation Dose Chart by Xkcd.png|thumb|Various doses of radioactivity in [[sievert]]s, ranging from trivial to lethal.]]
In response to concerns about the radiation released by the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]], and to remedy what he described as &quot;confusing&quot; reporting on radiation levels in the media, Munroe  created a chart of comparative radiation exposure levels.  The chart was rapidly adopted by print and online journalists in several countries, including being linked to by online writers for ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Monbiot|first=George |authorlink=George Monbiot |title=Why Fukushima made me stop worrying and love nuclear power |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/21/pro-nuclear-japan-fukushima |work=The Guardian |accessdate=29 March 2011 |location=London |date=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Revkin|first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Revkin |title=The 'Dread to Risk' Ratio on Radiation and other Discontents |url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/the-dread-to-risk-ratio-on-radiation-and-other-discontents/?hp |work=Dot Earth blog |publisher=''The New York Times'' |accessdate=29 March 2011 |date=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of requests for permission to reprint the chart and to translate it into Japanese, Munroe placed it in the [[public domain]], but requested that his non-expert status should be clearly stated in any reprinting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Munroe|first=Randall |title=&quot;Radiation Chart&quot; |url=http://blog.xkcd.com/2011/03/19/radiation-chart/ |publisher=www.xkcd.com |accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
