'''Jeremy Abbott''' (born June 5, 1985) is an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]]. He is the 2008 [[2008-2009 Grand Prix Final|Grand Prix Final Champion]], a two-time (2007, 2011) [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|Four Continents bronze medalist]] and two-time (2009, 2010) [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. national champion]]. He represented the United States at the [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics â Men's singles|2010 Winter Olympics]], where he placed ninth.

==Personal life==
Jeremy Abbott was born in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. He began skating at age two.&lt;ref name=usfs050511/&gt; He began competing at age four after seeing and becoming inspired by [[Robin Cousins]].&lt;ref name=usfs050511/&gt;

Following his win on the junior level at 2005 US nationals, Abbott established a fund in Aspen, Colorado, to help up-and-coming skaters to pay for training.&lt;ref name=usfs050511/&gt; In 2006, he established a second fund for skaters in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=usfs060921/&gt; In 2011, his Japanese fan club donated $1,000 dollars to his fund.&lt;ref name=tie110908/&gt;

Abbott attended [[Cheyenne Mountain High School]] for five years, stretching his high school career out one year longer than the usual, so he could concentrate on both skating and getting good grades. &lt;ref name=unseen/&gt; He graduated in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;icenetbio&quot;/&gt; His older sister, Gwen Abbott, was a nationally-ranked downhill skier who competed in the X Games as a ski racer.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In addition to his coaches past and present, Jeremy often cites his familyâmother Allison Scott, stepfather Allen Scott, father Danny Abbott and sister Gwen Abbottâas the pillars of his success.&lt;ref name=lifeskate/&gt;
 
==Skating career==
===Early career===
Abbott has competed in three figure skating disciplines. As a juvenile, he competed in [[ice dancing]] with Amanda Cunningham from 1995â1996 and with Katie Hoffmaster from 1997â1998. He competed as a [[pair skating|pair skater]] with [[Brittany Vise]] in 1998â1999 and Krystal Sorenson from 2001â2002.

In 1999, Abbott moved from Aspen to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] to train at the Colorado Springs World Arena with [[Tom Zakrajsek]].&lt;ref name=usfs050511/&gt; He began representing the [[Broadmoor Skating Club]]. 

Abbott began competing in singles at the novice level in the 2000â2001 season, but failed to make it out of sectionals. The next year he made it to Nationals, where he placed 6th at the novice level.

For the 2002â2003 and 2004â2005 seasons, Abbott competed on the junior level nationally, though he did not make it to 2003 nationals at the junior level. He fractured his L5 [[vertebra]] in 2003, which kept him off the ice for fifteen weeks&lt;ref&gt;[http://figureskating.teamusa.org/athletes/jeremy-abbott TeamUSA: Jeremy Abbott]&lt;/ref&gt; leading up to Regionals, yet he was able to win Regionals, and go on to place 7th at the [[2004 United States Figure Skating Championships|2004 U.S. Championships]].

He won the Junior national title at the [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships|2005 U.S. Championships]]. A remark he made during this competition, &quot;Stranger things could happen; pigs could fly!&quot;, led him to adopt as his mascot a pig with wings, or a flying pig. Abbott made it the slogan of his charitable fund, which he started to give back to young male skaters struggling to pay coaching fees, ice time and competition fees.

===Senior career===
Abbott was given his first senior international assignment in the 2005â2006 Olympic season, placing 18th at the [[2005 Nebelhorn Trophy]]. Abbott, then, placed fifth at the very competitive Midwestern Sectionals, and just missed a chance to go on to Nationals and compete for an Olympic berth. Abbott later blamed his performance on his poor training habits,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.figureskatersonline.com/jeremyabbott/spotlightonskating.pdf PDF - Spotlight on Skating]&lt;/ref&gt; and said that he had become lazy after winning the junior national title; failing to make it out of sectionals gave him the motivation he needed.

In the 2006â2007 season, Abbott was given another international assignment, this time to the [[2006 Finlandia Trophy]], which he won. He won sectionals and advanced to Nationals, where he won the pewter medal, the highest placement for a first-timer in the senior men's event at nationals in twenty years. Abbott was named the first alternate to the World and Four Continents teams. When [[Johnny Weir]] withdrew from the [[2007 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2007 Four Continents]], Abbott was given the opportunity to compete at the event, which was held at his home rink, [[World Arena, Colorado Springs]]. He beat out U.S. silver medalist and training mate [[Ryan Bradley]] for the bronze medal.

In the 2007â2008 season, Abbott debuted on the Grand Prix circuit, placing 8th at the [[2007 Skate Canada International|2007 Skate Canada]] and 4th at the [[2007 NHK Trophy]]. At the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]], he again won the pewter medal. He placed 5th at the [[2008 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2008 Four Continents]]. He was sent to the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|2008 World Championships]] after [[Evan Lysacek]] withdrew with injury, and placed 11th.

In the 2008â2009 season, Abbott had a breakthrough season on the Grand Prix circuit. He won the [[2008 Cup of China]] and placed fourth at the [[2008 Cup of Russia]] to qualify for the [[2008-2009 Grand Prix Final]]. He won the Grand Prix Final, becoming the first American man to do so, and achieved the highest total free skate score for an American man at that time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isufs.org/isujsstat/o100mto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 U.S. Championships]] in [[Cleveland]], Abbott won both the short program and the free skate to win the gold medal. At the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 World Championships]], Abbot placed 10th in both the short and long programs and 11th overall. In the off-season, he performed at the [[Festa On Ice]] show in [[South Korea]], his first ice show in a foreign country.

Abbott began the 2009â10 season with a 5th place finish at the [[2009 NHK Trophy]]. He then won the [[2009 Skate Canada]] to qualify once again for the Grand Prix Final, where he placed fourth. At the [[2010 United States Figure Skating Championships|2010 U.S. Championships]], Abbott won both segments of the competition to win the title overall, finishing 25 points ahead of the second place [[Evan Lysacek]]. He was named to the [[United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Olympic team]]. At the [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics â Men's singles|2010 Olympics]], Abbott placed 15th place in the short program, with a score of 69.40.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-figure-skating/schedule-and-results/men-short-program_fsm010201uH.html?update=0|title=Men â Short Program Results|date=February 16, 2010|publisher=IOC/Vancouver 2010|accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbott earned a score of 149.56 in the free skate, placing 9th in that segment of the competition and moving up to place 9th overall. At the [[2010 World Figure Skating Championships|2010 World Championships]], he skated a strong short to place 6th in the segment. In the long program, he fell on the quad and double axel and placed 5th overall.

In the off-season, Abbott performed on the [[Stars on Ice]] tour. His training for the new season was hampered by his first serious boot problems of his career.&lt;ref name=ieoct5/&gt;

In the [[2011 United States Figure Skating Championships|2011 U.S. Championships]], Abbott was second after the short program but struggled through parts of his long program to finished fourth overall and had to settle for the pewter medal after winning the title in 2009â10. Abbott scored 224.16 points overall, missing the bronze medal by just 0.19 points. The selection committee decided to leave him off the [[2011 World Figure Skating Championships|2011 Worlds]] team, disappointing Abbott who thought the rules stated that other results would be taken into consideration.&lt;ref name=breathe/&gt; He was named to the team to the [[2011 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2011 Four Continents]] instead, where he won the bronze medal behind Japanese skaters [[Daisuke Takahashi]] and [[Yuzuru Hanyu]]. The boot problems were resolved after discussions with Reidell.&lt;ref name=in110706/&gt;

For the [[2011â2012 ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|2011â2012 Grand Prix season]], Abbott was assigned to compete at [[2011 Cup of China]] and [[2011 Cup of Russia]].&lt;ref name=in110706/&gt; He later said they were not the two he had asked for but that it had worked out well.&lt;ref name=breathe/&gt; He placed third in both programs at Cup of China and came away with the gold medal overall. At Cup of Russia, Abbott won the short program with a new personal best of 83.54 points. He was fifth in the free program and won the bronze medal overall. He qualified for his third [[2011â2012 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]].

== Coaching changes ==
In his early years, Abbott was coached by Peggy Behr in Aspen, Colorado. In 1999, he moved to [[Tom Zakrajsek]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=usfs050511/&gt; In May 2009, he changed coaches to [[Yuka Sato]] in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]].&lt;ref name=usfsa090522/&gt; Abbott said he would continue training with Sato for the 2010â2011 season.&lt;ref name=roller/&gt; In a November 2011 interview, he said he was seeing a [[Sports psychology|sports psychologist]] once a week.&lt;ref name=breathe/&gt;
