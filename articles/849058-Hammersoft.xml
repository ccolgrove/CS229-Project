==Administration==
The corporation is headed by a Municipal commissioner, an [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]] officer. He wields the executive power of the house. A quinquennial election is held to elect corporators to power. They are responsible for overseeing that their constituencies have the basic civic infrastructure in place, and that there is no lacuna on the part of the authorities. The '''mayor''' (a largely ceremonial post with limited duties) heads the party with the largest vote.

The corporation's legislature, also known as the Corporation Council, is composed of (as of 2009) 227 members.

==Jurisdiction==
The BMC is responsible for most of Mumbai's territory. Their realm extends from [[Colaba]] in the south to [[Mulund]] and [[Dahisar]] in the north. Some regions such as Defence lands, Mumbai Port Trust lands and the [[Borivali National Park]] area are out of their jurisdiction. The city is subdivided into alphabetical wards, from A to T. Each ward has own ward office which oversees its territory. The [[The Municipal Corporation Building, Mumbai|headquarters]] of the civic administration are in [[South Mumbai]] opposite the [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus]].
