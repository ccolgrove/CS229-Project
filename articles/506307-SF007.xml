'''Gibraltar Firewall''' is an [[operating system]] based on [[Debian]]. Gibraltar is used to secure local area networks as a firewall software. The current version is 3.0, published on 06 February, 2010.

Dr. Rene Mayrhofer published Gibraltar Firewall in 1999. Since January 2003, the company eSYS Information Systems is responsible for the development of Gibraltar.
Gibraltar Linux is based on free Software, which was enhanced by a web based administration tool. For running the firewall, no hard disk is needed, because Gibraltar is able to start up and run directly off CDROM. Configuration data can be stored on floppy disk or USB sticks.

Since version 2.4, Gibraltar is also available in combination with several hardware platforms. On these appliances, Gibraltar boots up from compact flash.

The core modules of Gibraltar are:
* [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]] with stateful packet inspection
* [[Proxy server]]
* [[Virtual private network]]
* [[Spamfilter]]
* [[Antivirus]] gateway
* [[Traffic shaping]]
* [[Anonymizer]]
