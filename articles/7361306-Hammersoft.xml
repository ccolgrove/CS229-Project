&quot;'''You Got the Love'''&quot; is a 1986 single by the band [[The Source (band)|The Source]] and [[Candi Staton]]. One of its many remixers also adopted the name [[The Source (musician)|The Source]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Source%2C+The+(7) You Got the Love by The Source, release]. [[Discogs]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the song was recorded by English [[Soul music|soul]] singer [[Joss Stone]] for her fourth [[studio album]], &quot;''[[Colour Me Free!]]''&quot; released in October 2009. In November 2009, another cover version was released as a single by English [[indie rock]] [[music group|band]], [[Florence &amp; The Machine]].

==Details==
The original version is a soul/disco/gospel track (released in the UK by Streetwave in 1986) written by Anthony B. Stephens, Arnecia Michelle Harris and John Bellamy. It featured an a cappella version utilised by Paul Simpson for a remix of the [[Adeva]] song &quot;Musical Freedom&quot; in 1989. The most well known house mix by DJ Eren was released in 1991 and layered the vocal track over an instrumental version of the [[Frankie Knuckles]]/[[Jamie Principle]] house song &quot;[[Your Love (Frankie Knuckles song)|Your Love]]&quot; itself a stripped down version of the italo-disco track &quot;Feels Good (Carrots and Beets)&quot; by Electra featuring Tara Butler. The original Candi Staton track had been recorded for a [[Direct-to-video|video-only]] 1980s documentary about an obese man who was trying to lose weight. When approached by The Source, Candi said she couldn't remember having recorded a song called &quot;You Got the Love&quot;. It was only later that she realised she had performed the song years earlier for the documentary. The producers of the video had selected the song for her to sing, but as they had no funds to pay her, they donated half of the copyright and publishing to Candi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1737687,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=I was so drunk I fell on to the stage | first=Sophie | last=Heawood | date=24 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DJ Eren track was originally released in 1991, and reached number 4 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It was remixed and re-issued in 1997 (including the Now Voyager mix), this time reaching number 3, the song's highest position, and then re-issued again in 2006 with new mixes by the [[Shapeshifters (band)|Shapeshifters]] among others, reaching number 7. The 2006 mix also featured more lyrics than the first two versions.

The &quot;Now Voyager mix&quot; (released in 1996 and 1997) of the track was featured in the final moments of the ''[[Sex and the City]]'' [[An American Girl in Paris, Part Deux (SATC episode)|series finale]] in 2004. The track's new mixes and the inclusion of the track in the show is one factor of its 2006 reissue. The ''Original Bootleg Radio Mix'' of the track was also featured in the film ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' in the club where Sidney talks to the film's protagonist as he looks on at Sidney's girlfriend.

In 2007, Manchester Band [[The Longcut]] recorded a version as part of their double A-Side release on Melodic Records

&quot;Florence and the Machine&quot; version was released 16 November 2009, from the acclaimed album &quot;Lungs&quot;, and is considered to be the song that launched their career

The song has a clear Christian message: Staton talks of giving up on God, only to discover that He has &quot;got the love I need to see me through&quot;, and that &quot;the Saviour's love is real&quot;. The theme behind the song is one of uplift and empowerment.

==Music video==
The 1997 video features the &quot;Now Voyager mix&quot; and portrays a black man carrying a cross, and being guided by an angel and tempted by the Devil.

The 2006 version features the &quot;Now Voyager mix&quot; in a black and white video. Set in London, it portrays an [[Angelic]] young man watching out for the poor, lonely and vulnerable in the streets, subways and gardens.

&quot;'''You've Got the Love'''&quot; is the fifth single released by the band [[Florence and the Machine]]; the band consists of Florence Welch (the lead singer) and a backing band made of session musicians, from their 2009 Brit award-winning debut album ''[[Lungs (album)|Lungs]]''. It was first released on 1 December 2008 as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of their second single &quot;[[Dog Days Are Over]]&quot;. It was then later released as a digital download only single on 5 January 2009 in the United Kingdom only, after the mass praise it received during the release of &quot;Dog Days Are Over&quot;. It is a cover version of the song &quot;You Got the Love&quot; by [[The Source (musician)|The Source]] featuring [[Candi Staton]] with a slightly changed name. After being released well before ''Lungs'' was finally recorded and released, it was later featured on the album as its bonus track.

The single was given a re-release on physical format on 16 November 2009 in the United Kingdom. For the reissue a music video was shot.

===Background===
The track, which is significantly shorter than the original, was produced by [[Charlie Hugall]], who also produced three other tracks on ''Lungs''. Hugall was also involved in the bass and percussion development of the song. The track features Isabella Summers on piano, Christopher Lloyd Hayden on drums, Tom Moth on harp, Rob Ackroyd on guitar and Florence Welch on vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Florence-The-Machine-Lungs/release/1872408 |title=Florence + The Machine* â Lungs (CD, Album, Enh, Ltd, Dig + CD, Album, Ltd, Dig) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florence Welch describing her inspiration behind covering &quot;one of her favourite songs ever&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As a kid, going to clubs and raves, this song made me feel love. At Bestival last year we were top of the bill on that stage, so we were thinking of an amazing cover we could do, and I thought of [[Candi Staton]]. Even in rehearsals, playing it was just the most euphoric feeling. Then playing it live and seeing everyone's arms in the air, and the faces â it was the best feeling ever! I was dressed as a genie sea-monster, and I remember looking at my guitarist as we played the first chords, and then there was the reaction and it was like tearing ourselves open and just exploding on the crowd, and then all did it back. It's a feeling you couldn't express. I'm really excited that now in our live shows I'm going to be playing one of my favourite songs ever, loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florenceandthemachine.net/news/24-30/florence-on-lungs-part-three/0-6 |title=Official Website &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Gigs &amp;#124; Music &amp;#124; Blogs â News |publisher=Florence And The Machine |date= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;You've Got the Love&quot;, a fan favourite of the band has been played at numerous festivals around the United Kingdom during 2008 and 2009. Including the Bestival, [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], Way Out West, [[Brighton]], Electric Picnic, [[Leeds]], Smash &amp; Grab and with an acoustic version being performed at a festival in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. It's also been performed Live In Ibiza on [[BBC Radio 1]] and at the BBC Live Big Weekend.

===Critical response===
Reviewers have also commented on this song during reviews of &quot;Dog Days Are Over&quot;. [[MusicOMH]] commented on the song by saying that &quot;Following with her tradition of some finely chosen cover versions, there's even an excellent rendition of The Source's You Got the Love.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicomh.com/singles/florence-and-the-machine-2_1108.htm Florence and the Machine MusicOMH Review]. [[MusicOMH]] review.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Contactmusic.com]] also commented on the song by saying that &quot;The B-side cover of [[The Source (musician)|The Source]] ft. [[Candi Staton]]'s &quot;You Got the Love&quot; is equally strong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/home.nsf/singlereview/florence-and-the-machine-dog-days-are-overx09x12x08 Florence and the Machine dog days are over - contactmusic review]. [[Contactmusic.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Dailymusicguide.com also positively reviewed the single, writing, 
&quot;Florence + The Machine have used the format of the original remix but have certainly breathed new life into this old classic. With Florence Welch's distinctive voice she makes this song her own. The inclusion of a harp only adds to the gentle sway effect produced by the track, bursting gently in without malice at around eighteen seconds in.
The song's lyrics are empowering: Florence's heavenly voice has a vulnerable quality which, as it has with relatively short career so far, grows stronger through You've Got The Love's verse and chorus. It's empowering, liberating and moving all at the same time, not least conveyed by the emotion in Welch's vocals.

===Music video===
Despite originally being released as a single almost nine months earlier, the band announced on 18 September 2009 that a music video would be made for the song and would be shot on 21 September 2009 in London. It features Welch in a white, sparkly leotard dancing on a large [[moon]]-shaped platform suspended over a nightclub, an homage to [[Studio 54]]. The video later shows many people beneath her dancing to the song. The video that will air on United Kingdom television has a different version of the song to the one on the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.florenceandthemachine.net/news/0-6/appear-in-the-video-for-youve-got-the-love |title=Official Website &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Gigs &amp;#124; Music &amp;#124; Blogs â News |publisher=Florence And The Machine |date= |accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
