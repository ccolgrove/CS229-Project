'''Xmonad''' (styled as xmonad) is a [[tiling window manager]] for the [[X Window System]], written in the [[Functional programming|functional programming language]] [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

Begun in March 2007, it is similar to [[dwm]], [[larswm]], [[Stumpwm|StumpWM]] and other members of the [[tiling window manager]] family in that it arranges windows in a nonoverlapping pattern and strives to make it possible for the user to productively manage windows without the use of the [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]]. Xmonad is [[Package management system|packaged]] and distributed on a wide range of [[Unix-like]] operating systems, such as [[Arch Linux]], [[Debian]], &lt;!-- [[Fedora Linux]]&lt;ref&gt;http://fedorapeople.org/~ynemoy/xmonad/&lt;/ref&gt;,--&gt; [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], [[Source Mage]], [[NixOS]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[Mac OS X]].

While originally a [[Clone (computer science)|clone]] of dwm (derivative in areas such as default keybindings), Xmonad now supports features not available to dwm users&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as per-workspace layout, tiling reflection, state preservation, layout mirroring, [[GNOME]] support and per-screen status bars; it can be customised by modifying an external configuration file and 'reloaded' while running.&lt;ref&gt;Through a combination of swiftly re-compiling and then [[Exec (operating system)|execing]] the new XMonad binary; see {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; XMonad features have begun to influence other tiling window managers - dwm has borrowed &quot;urgency hooks&quot; from XMonad,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.dwm/4325/focus=4330 developer discussion] on the dwm mailing list&lt;/ref&gt; has also included [[Xinerama]] support (for [[Multi-monitor|multihead displays]]) with [[Software versioning|release]] 4.8, and patches exist to reimplement XMonad's Fibonacci layout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suckless.org/dwm/patches/fibonacci.html Suckless.org: Fibonacci layouts patch] to dwm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- There are also many feature requests along the lines of 'XMonad has...why can't we have that?', like http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.awesome/232/match=xmonad but I'm undecided on whether to mention that. --&gt;

Extensions to the core system, including emulation of other window managers and unusual layout algorithms, such as window [[Tessellation|tiling]] based on the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci spiral]], have been implemented by the active community&lt;ref&gt;Xmonad users generate significant traffic in the [http://gogloom.com/FreeNode/xmonad/ #xmonad] [[IRC]] channel and the XMonad mailing list; in addition, there are a significant number of commits to the extension library from non-core devs (see the [http://xmonad.org/statistics.html XMonad statistic page])&lt;/ref&gt; and are available as a library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to obviating the need for the mouse, the Xmonad developers make heavy use of semi-[[formal methods]] and [[program derivation]] for improving reliability and enabling a total [[Source lines of code|line of code]] count less than 1200, as of version 0.7; window manager properties (such as the behavior of window focus) are checked through use of [[QuickCheck]]. This emphasis makes Xmonad unusual in a number of ways; besides being the first window manager written in Haskell, it is also the first to use the [[zipper (data structure)|zipper]] [[data structure]] for automatically managing [[Focus (computing)|focus]], and its core has been proven to be safe with respect to [[Pattern matching|pattern matches]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2007/05/does-xmonad-crash.html &quot;Does xmonad crash? On proving pattern coverage in xmonad with Catch&quot;]; [http://neilmitchell.blogspot.com/2007/05/preconditions-on-xmonad.html &quot;Preconditions on XMonad&quot;]; see also [http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/downloads/slides-detecting_pattern_match_failures_in_haskell-26_nov_2007.pdf &quot;Detecting pattern-match failures in Haskell&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; contributing further to reliability. The developers write:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;xmonad is a tiling window manager for the X Window system, implemented, configured and dynamically extensible in Haskell. This demonstration presents the case that software dominated by side effects can be developed with the precision and efficiency we expect from Haskell by utilising purely functional data structures, an expressive type system, extended static checking and property-
based testing. In addition, we describe the use of Haskell as an application configuration and extension language.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart &amp; Janssen, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;By utilising the expressivity of a modern functional language with a rich [[static typing|static type]] system, xmonad provides a complete, featureful window manager in less than 500 lines of code, with an emphasis on correctness and robustness. Internal properties of the window manager are checked using a combination of static guarantees provided by the type system, and type-based automated testing. A benefit of this is that the code is simple to understand, and easy to modify.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
--&gt;
It makes use of Haskell features and tools such as: QuickCheck, [[Glasgow Haskell Compiler|GHC]] extensions like [[Guard (computing)|pattern guards]], [[Monads in functional programming|monads]], [[monad transformer]]s, zippers, and the [[Cabal (software)|Cabal]] packaging system, in addition to Haskell bindings to [[Xlib]] and [[xft]] fonts&lt;!-- technically a separate package used in XMC, but eh. --&gt; (with rebinding to [[XCB]] planned when the Haskell bindings are released).

&lt;!-- Note: at some point, Neil Mitchell will finish his PhD thesis which uses XMonad as a test-case for Catch. When he does, it'll be listed at http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/catch/ and then we'll be able to add it in as further academic work making use of XMonad. --&gt;
