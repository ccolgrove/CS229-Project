'''''Michael Jackson's Moonwalker''''' ('''ãã¤ã±ã«ã»ã¸ã£ã¯ã½ã³ãºã»ã ã¼ã³ã¦ã©ã¼ã«ã¼''' ''Maikeru Jakusonzu MÅ«n'u~ÅkÄ'') is a franchise for  several [[video game]]s based on the [[Moonwalker|film of the same name]] created by [[U.S. Gold]] and [[Sega]] in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] and [[1990 in video gaming|1990]] that incorporate the personage of and were co-developed by [[Michael Jackson]] himself. The arcade version, home video games and home computer versions all differ in terms of gameplay, but the story and concept remain constant. The story, which is taken from the ''[[Moonwalker]]'' film, follows Michael, using various music and dance related abilities, on a quest to save kidnapped children from the hands of the evil &quot;Mr. Big&quot;. The games incorporated synthesized versions of the musician's hits, such as &quot;[[Beat It]]&quot; and &quot;[[Smooth Criminal]]&quot;. The games have now achieved cult status and are remembered for being a memorable point in Jackson's change to a different stage persona from &quot;[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]&quot;, to &quot;[[Bad (album)|Bad]]&quot;.

According to STI director Roger Hector, [[Michael Jackson]] was brought in initially during development to compose music for the game, but no mention of his involvement was included. This was supposedly due to the scandals that arose around Jackson at the time, his involvement was removed from the title, and much reworking had to be done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Gamasutra |work=GameSetWatch |title=Michael Jackson's Secret Sonic 3 Shame |date=2006-03-27 |author=Carless, Simon |accessdate=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims are dubious, however, and various interviews have made it clear that any involvement Jackson may have had was done without the knowledge of Sega's executives or marketing staff, and no contracts or formal agreements had ever been made.&lt;ref name=&quot;sega-16.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sega-16.com/feature_page.php?id=392&amp;title=Sega%20Legends:%20Michael%20Jackson%20&amp;%20Sonic%203 | title=Sega Legends: Michael Jackson &amp; Sonic 3 | last=Horowitz | first=Ken | publisher=Sega-16|date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Hansen, of Sonic Stuff Research Group, retorts that Cirocco (credited as &quot;Scirocco&quot; in Sonic 3) still has possession of presumably a demo version of fabled soundtrack. &quot;I actually have &quot;ALL&quot; of the tracks...,&quot; he writes, &quot;from the original humming of Michael calling in the middle of the night leaving messages, to his ideas at Record One with Matt and Bruce. - BUT, I don't think I can let any of that out to the public without permission.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;sega-16.com&quot;/&gt; In December 2009, Michael Jackson's composer, Brad Buxer, told French magazine ''Black &amp; White'' that Jackson was actually involved with some of Sonic 3's compositions, supposedly not being credited because he wasn't happy with how they sounded, due to the lack of optimal sound reproduction on the Genesis. Buxer also claimed that the ending music of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 later became the basis for Jackson's single [[Stranger in Moscow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Montgomery, James&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=MTV.com |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1627664/20091204/jackson_michael.jhtml |title=Did Michael Jackson Compose 'Sonic The Hedgehog 3' Soundtrack? |date=2009-12-04 |author=Montgomery, James |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The May 2007 issue of [[Electronic Gaming Monthly|EGM]] contains a quote from series creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi concerning what it was like to work with Michael:
:&quot;We were in the middle of production of ''Space Channel 5'', in 1998 or 1999. I got a call from the U.S. from my partner - the executive producer of ''Space Channel 5'' - and he said, 'Oh, Michael wants to act in ''Space Channel 5''.' I said, 'Who's Michael?' 'Who is Michael Jackson?' he said, '''The'' Michael Jackson - the ''real'' Michael Jackson'
:My partner had shown him the 60-to-70 percent complete version, when it was almost at the end of the game. We had one month to finalize. But Michael wanted to do something, so we suggested that if he was OK with it, we could program the people in the game to do the Michael Jackson dance when taken over by aliens. he said 'yeah.' We initially had five aliens who danced. One of them became Michael Jackson.&quot;
