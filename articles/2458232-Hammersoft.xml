'''Route 140''' is a {{convert|107.8|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[state highway]] which passes through parts of southeastern and central [[Massachusetts]].  The highway follows a southeast-northwest trajectory, running from [[US 6 (MA)|U.S. Route 6]] in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]] just north of [[Buzzards Bay]] northwest to an intersection with [[Massachusetts Route 12]] in [[Winchendon, Massachusetts|Winchendon]], a few miles south of the border with [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Massachusetts Atlas and Gazetteer.&quot;  Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme.  First Edition, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern 19 miles (30&amp;nbsp;km) of Route 140 runs as a [[freeway]] between New Bedford and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] south from exit 12 off [[Route 24 (Massachusetts)|Route 24]] to its southern terminus at US-6.

==Route description==
===Exit list (New Bedford Expressway)===
The New Bedford Expressway has 12 numbered interchanges.  The southbound intersection with U.S. Route 6, despite being an at-grade intersection, is signed as Exit 1 on the overhead guide sign.  The I-195 interchange was formerly signed as Exits 2E and 2W, but have been resigned as Exits 2A and 2B.  Likewise, the interchange with Route 24 formerly signed Exits 12N and 12S are now signed as Exits 12A and 12B.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Street Atlas of Metro Boston and Eastern Massachusetts.&quot;  Bridgewater, Massachusetts: Arrow Map, Inc.  2003 Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Highway Improvements==
The section of Route 140 was Widened to 4 Lanes and Realigned in Franklin. The $22 Million Project was Completed in 2007.

===MA-79 Truck===
[[Image:Truck plate.svg|35px|left]]&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:MA Route 79.svg|35px|left]]

MA-140 runs partially concurrent with MA-79 Truck. It is signed from Exit 10 ([[Massachusetts Route 79|MA-79]]) to Exit 12. At Exit 12 it runs onto [[Massachusetts Route 24|MA-24]] where it meets its parent at Exit 9.

==History==
[[Image:MA Route 64.svg|50px|left]]The section of modern Route 140 from West Boylston to Gardner was numbered '''Route 64''' when it was first commissioned by 1933.  By 1939, the entirety of the route was redesignated as Route 140, effectively extending existing 140 northeast (it had previously run from New Bedford and ended in Grafton).&lt;ref&gt;[http://neilbert.com/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=MA+140 Neilbert.com Home: MA 140]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the building of the freeway section, County Street (the section of road beginning at the Taunton River, and also known as County Road) brought the road southward through East Taunton, Berkley, Lakeville and East Freetown.  The road, which runs parallel to the freeway and crosses it in Lakeville, merged with [[Massachusetts Route 18|Route 18]] in East Freetown, just north of the New Bedford city limits.  The old alignment begins in front of the [[Silver City Galleria]] in Taunton.
