'''Conary''' is a [[free software]] [[package management system]] created by [[rPath]] and distributed under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License#Version 3|GNU General Public License Version 3]].&lt;ref name=&quot;license&quot;&gt;[http://blogs.conary.com/index.php/conarynews/2011/05/26/more_open_source_for_conary/ The license changed] from the [[Common Public License]]. The [http://hg.rpath.com/conary-2.3/rev/ceb203109612 change was implemented] on Aug 15. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on installing packages through automated dependency resolution against distributed online [[Software repository|repositories]], and providing a concise and easy-to-use [[Python (language)|Python]]-based description language to specify how to build a package. It is used by [[Foresight Linux]] and [[rPath|rPath Linux]].

Conary updates only those specific files in packages which need to be updated; this behavior minimizes bandwidth and time requirements for updating software packages. Conary  also features [[Rollback (data management)|Rollback]]s&lt;ref name=rollbacks&gt;[http://almostconnecticut.net/linuxismylife/2011/06/rollback-a-barrel-of-fun/ Rollback, a barrel of fun]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=opensolaris&gt;[http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+conary-eval/ Evaluate Conary (Project conary-eval WebHome]&lt;/ref&gt; of package installation as well as derived packages &lt;ref name=&quot;derived_packages&quot;&gt;[http://ewtroan.livejournal.com/16174.html ewtroan: Derived Packages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Conary toolchain includes '''rmake''', a build server for conary packages, which builds packages inside [[chroot]] environments containing only the package's explicitly listed build requirements and some other fundamental packages. This is very useful for packagers, because it means that package builds can be done inside a reproducible environment, and packagers cannot accidentally introduce dependencies on peculiarities of their machine's environment (such as custom configuration files, or undocumented extra packages).
