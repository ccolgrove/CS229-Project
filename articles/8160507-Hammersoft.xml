Warfare through history has mainly been a matter for men, but women have also played a role, occasionally a leading one. The following list of prominent women in war and their exploits from about 1750 C.E. up to about 1799 C.E. can only indicate the involvement of women, some of them thrust into positions of leadership by [[accident of birth]] or family connection, others by force of circumstance from humble origins.
