[[Image:Fedora line drawing.svg|thumb|A fedora that has been &quot;pinched&quot; at the front and worn pushed back on the head, with the front of the brim bent down over the eyes.]]
A '''fedora''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|f|É¨|Ë|d|ÉË|r|É|}}) is a men's [[felt]] [[hat]]. In reality, &quot;fedora&quot; describes most any men's hat that does not already have another name; quite a few fedoras have famous names of their own including the famous [[Trilby]].

The hat is typically creased lengthwise down the [[Hat#Parts of a hat|crown]] and &quot;pinched&quot; in the front on both sides, &lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cotton, &quot;Hats&quot; (Published by Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang) 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  though the creasing does not define the hat. Fedoras can also be creased with teardrop crowns, diamond crowns, center dents, and others, and the positioning of pinches can vary if they are found at all. Fedoras were originally sold &quot;open crown&quot;, meaning they were uncreased, with the owner creating the desired creases. A customer could always opt to have the shop add shape to the hat if desired.

The brim is usually approximately 2.5 inches wide, but may be wider&lt;ref&gt;Kilgour, Ruth Edwards (1958). A Pageant of Hats Ancient and Modern. R. M. McBride Company.&lt;/ref&gt;, can be left &quot;raw edged&quot;, finished with a sewn ''overwelt'' or ''underwelt'', bound with [[grosgrain]] ribbon, or finished with a self-felted cavanagh edge. A [[trilby]] hat is a kind of fedora, with a slightly narrower brim which is more sharply upturned.

The term ''fedora'' was in use as early as 1891. The fedora came into use in about 1890 as a men's middle-class clothing accessory. Its popularity soared, and eventually it eclipsed the similar-looking [[Homburg (hat)|Homburg]].  Fedoras can be found in nearly any color, but black, grey, tan (&quot;fawn&quot;), and dark brown are the most popular.

==History==

The word ''fedora'' comes from the title of an 1882 play by [[Victorien Sardou]], ''[[FÃ©dora]]'', written for [[Sarah Bernhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;
Encarta Dictionary, Microsoft Encarta Premium Suite 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was first performed in the United States in 1889. Bernhardt played Princess FÃ©dora, the heroine of the play, and she wore a hat similar to what is now considered a fedora. The fedora became a female fashion which lasted into the early part of the 20th century. When the fedora became a male fashion item, it was popular in cities for its stylishness, ability to protect the wearer's head from the wind and weather, and the fact that it could be rolled up when not in use. Since the early part of the 20th century, many [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] and other [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jew]]s have worn black fedoras and continue to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Jody Shields, John Dugdale â &quot;Hats: A Stylish History and Collector's Guide&quot; (Published by Clarkson Potter) 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The hat is sometimes associated with the era of [[Prohibition]], [[Great Depression]]âera gangsters and detectives. Popular stars in the 1950s such as [[Gene Kelly]] wore fedoras often in their movies. In [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood movies]] of the 1940s, characters often wore fedoras, particularly when portraying private detectives, gangsters, or other &quot;tough guy&quot; roles. A [[trench coat]] was frequently part of the costume, a notable example being [[Humphrey Bogart]]'s character in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''. The fedora is widely recognized with the characters of [[The Spirit]], [[Daisuke Jigen]], [[Freddy Krueger]], [[Dick Tracy]], [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] and especially [[Indiana Jones]]. It is also closely associated with [[film noir]] characters.

Like the [[bowler hat]], the fedora was popular from the early 1920s to the mid 1960s on the east coast of the United States.  In the late 1950s the hat began to lose favor on the west coast of the United States, which is known for its more casual clothing. The late 1950s switch from wider lapels and ties to thin ones resulted in shorter-brimmed hats, diminishing their practicality.  This likely played a role in the fedora eventually being deemed a non-essential item.

Also playing a part in the unpopularity of the fedora was the shrinking automobiles of the mid-1950s, which often made it difficult to wear a hat while driving. By the early 1970s, the fedora was seen as a dead fashion, typically only worn by older or more conservative men. However, the fedora has seen a revival in recent fashion seasons. In the early 1980s, pop stars [[Daniel Newton]] and [[Michael Jackson]] began using black and white fedoras which became trademarks. Famous Alabama Crimson Tide head football coach [[Bear Bryant]] was also known for wearing one, as were [[Dallas Cowboys]] head coach [[Tom Landry]] and English [[novelist]] [[Terry Pratchett]].

The [[trilby]], a type of fedora having a narrower brim and lower crown, has become a part of youth fashion in the 2000s due to its [[retro]] appeal, and is normally associated with [[indie rock]]/bohemian, [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] and [[ska]] scenes. [[Leonard Cohen]] (whose sartorial merits have won him the 1997 BOM, Best Dressed Montrealer Award)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardcohenfiles.com/jew.html Leonardcohenfiles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardcohen.com/news_archive.cgi?page=7&amp;display=10 Leonardcohen.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and his band members wore fedoras during the exceptionally successful world-tour of 2008â2010, which saw Leonard Cohen take to the scene after almost a decade of absence.
