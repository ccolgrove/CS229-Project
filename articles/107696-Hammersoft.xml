'''Walnut''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 29,172 at the 2010 census and its current mayor is Tom King, a former Detective from the Los Angeles Police Department.

The city of Walnut obtained its name from the Rancho Los Nogales Mexican land grant, ''nogales'' being the Spanish word for &quot;walnut.&quot; With exceptions to some busy intersections (such as Grand avenue and Amar near [[Mt. San Antonio College]]), the hilly and affluent city is relatively more quiet in comparison to nearby neighborhoods. The city covers nearly nine square miles (23&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and is home to more than 29,000 people and 600 businesses.

[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'s Best Places to Live, &quot;America's best small towns,&quot; ranked Walnut as #70 in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/snapshots/PL0683332.html | work=CNN | title=Best Places to Live 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #57 in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2011/snapshots/PL0683332.html | work=CNN | title=Best Places to Live 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Money's list of America's best small townsthe highest ranking for a Californian city both years.

==History==
The history of Walnut dates back to the Indians who were of Shoshone origin. They were called &quot;Gabrielino Indians&quot; by the Spaniards, who arrived in the early 19th century, because the Indians lived in an area controlled by the San Gabriel Mission. Walnut was primarily used for the grazing of cattle and sheep by the Mission.

The first Mexican land grants in the Walnut area were those of [[Rancho San Jose (Palomares)|Rancho San Jose]] granted to [[Ricardo Vejar]] and [[Ygnacio Palomares]] in 1837; [[Rancho Los Nogales]] granted to Jose De La Cruz Linares in 1840; and [[Rancho La Puente]] granted to [[John A. Rowland|John Rowland]] and [[Workman-Temple family|William Workman]] in 1842.  In 1868, John Rowland and William Workman divided Rancho La Puente, leaving Rowland the eastern half and Workman the western half. Rowlandâs land included the western portion of Walnut. The land was used for raising cattle and growing wheat, grapes, and fruit trees.

The City of Walnutâs Bicentennial Commission selected the construction of Lemon Creek Park and the restoration of the William R. Rowland Adobe Redwood Ranch House as Walnutâs bicentennial project. In 1871, the Lemon Creek Park area became the property of Sheriff William Rowland, who inherited the {{convert|29000|acre|km2|-1|sing=on}} ranch from his father, John Rowland. The modest structure built in 1883 served as the home of Mr. Meridith, [[ranch foreman]] for William Rowland. The adobe redwood ranch house is one of the few remaining original ranch style redwood and adobe structures in the area. On October 1, 1975, the State Landmark Committee placed the W.R. Rowland ranch house in the National Registry of Historical Places.

Walnut, California, is sometimes confused with the city of [[Walnut Creek, California|Walnut Creek]] in [[Northern California]]. 

==Walnut Family Festival==
Walnut holds an annual &quot;Walnut Family Festival.&quot;  On the day of festival, several streets in the area (such as portions of Lemon and La Puente) are closed in the morning and a parade is held in which many local clubs and groups participate.  Later in the afternoon, a fair with booths, games, food, and activities is held in Suzanne Park, adjacent to Suzanne Middle School.

==Proposed NFL Stadium==
In April 2008, billionaire-land developer and co-owner of the Los Angeles Lakers and Kings, [[Edward P. Roski]], unveiled plans for the construction of an $800 million NFL stadium in the neighboring [[Industry, California|City of Industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium proposal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sgvtribune.com/stadium/ci_8967041 | title=NFL stadium set for industry | accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2009, Walnut filed a lawsuit opposing construction of the stadium, but dropped those charges in September.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sgvtribune.com/ci_11996296 | title=Walnut files Lawsuit over NFL Stadium | accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dropped charges&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/09/agreement-gives-proposed-nfl-stadium-in-industry-a-boost.html | title=Plan for NFL site in City of Industry clears major legal hurdle | accessdate=2009-09-24 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2009, California governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed a bill allowing the 75,000-seat stadium to be built in neighboring [[Industry, California|Industry]] in hopes of attracting an NFL team there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=ArNaDzDHPXdDcPkBtWS9VZ9DubYF?slug=ap-nfl-losangeles&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns Governor approves LA-area football stadium waiver]&lt;/ref&gt;  This bill would also nullify a lawsuit filed by local residents over the project's [[environmental impact report]].
