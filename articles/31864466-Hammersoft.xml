'''[[Disney Junior]]''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[English language]] [[premium television]] service aimed at [[preschoolers]]. It was launched as a [[multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] of [[Family (TV channel)|Family]] originally known as [[Playhouse Disney|Playhouse Disney Channel]] on November 30, 2007, a 24/7 commercial-free channel carrying programs aimed at [[preschool]]-aged children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kidscreen.com/articles/magazine/20071101/playhouse.html?__b=yes; Playhouse Disney splashes out for Canuck launch], KidScreen, [[2007-11-01]]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Family, Disney Junior has only one national feed operating from the [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time Zone]]. For satellite, it is exclusively carried on [[Bell TV]]. The channel was re-launched under the new [[Disney Junior]] brand on May 6, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2011/03/c7649.html DISNEY JUNIOR LAUNCHES MAY 6 WITH NEW PROGRAMS AND A NOD TO CLASSIC DISNEY CHARACTERS AND MAGIC], CNW, [[2011-03-03]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Family is licensed as a premium service which allows for the addition of multiplex channels that are consistent with the network's licence, no additional licence was required to launch the service. Existing subscribers of Family are automatically eligible to receive Disney Junior free of charge, subject to carriage by their television service provider; however, it is not available on a standalone basis. The use of Family's existing licence also allows the service to compete with the preschooler-aimed specialty channel, [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]], despite the format protection guidelines for specialty channels. This is so, because Family's nature of service is to broadcast programming targeted toward &quot;youth to age 17&quot;, in which case, a preschool audience would qualify.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2002/db2002-386.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-386], CRTC, 2002-11-28&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Disney Junior (Canadian French TV channel)|French language version]] of the channel, then known as Playhouse Disney TÃ©lÃ©, launched on July 5, 2010. It was re-launched as Disney Junior on May 6, 2011 to coincide with the rebranding of the English channel. However, unlike the English version of Disney Junior, the French version is a [[Category 2 specialty channel|category 2]] service using its own licence, which originally branded the channel as a spin-off of [[Vrak.TV]].
