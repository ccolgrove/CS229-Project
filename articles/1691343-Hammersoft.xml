'''Ralph Garman''' (born November 17, 1964) is an American actor, comedian, and radio host best known as the host of ''[[The Joe Schmo Show]]'', for his voice work in ''[[Family Guy]]'', and as the entertainment reporter and impressionist for the ''[[Kevin and Bean]]'' morning show on Los Angeles radio station, [[KROQ-FM]]. Garman was hired to work on the Kevin and Bean show through [[Jimmy Kimmel]] (who at the time was working as the sports reporter on the show) who had received a recommendation to hire him through former roommate [[Adam Carolla]].&lt;ref&gt;Loveline, 1999-05-20 (Guest - Ralph Garman)&lt;/ref&gt; He currently co-hosts the &quot;Hollywood Babble-On&quot; [[podcast]] with [[Kevin Smith]] on the [[SModcast]] Podcast Network.

==Hollywood Babble-On==
{{unreferenced|date=November 2011}}
In August, 2010 Garman and Smith started recording Hollywood Babble-On at Smith's SModcastle theater; the podcast was subsequently moved to the larger capacity ''Jon Lovitz Podcast Theatre'', formerly known as the ''[[Jon Lovitz#The Jon Lovitz Comedy Club|Jon Lovitz Comedy Club]]''. The show discusses current events happening in Hollywood, and includes segments such as ''Tinseltown Stiffs'' (where recently deceased Hollywood celebrities are discussed) and ''Hollywood Helpers'' (where the pair point out acts of helpfulness or charity amongst the show business crowd). When discussing current events with Smith, Garman will also perform impressions of famous actors such as [[Harrison Ford]], [[Al Pacino]], [[Charlton Heston]], [[Adam West]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Ed Wynn]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]]. Garman also discusses talk-show host [[Chelsea Handler]] (whom he dislikes) in a segment known as the ''Talentless Cunt Update''. Fans of the show have created an informal [[drinking game]] (mostly centered around Garman's phrase &quot;''How dare you, sir?''&quot; and Smith's overuse of the word &quot;''whatnot''&quot;), which the hosts have mentioned approvingly.
