An '''MDS file''' is an optional media [[descriptor]] file that can be generated when creating a [[disk image|disc image]] from a CD or DVD. The format is a [[binary file]] with the [[Magic_number_(programming)|magic number]] &quot;MEDIA DESCRIPTOR&quot; appearing in the beginning of the file. The MDS file contains [[metadata]] about the original media, specifically the position of the [[layer break|layer breaks]] or [[layer breach bit]], a property of the [[CD/DVD copy protection|copy protection feature of DVDs]]. An MDS file is then used in conjunction with its related disc image to re-create the DVD. It is called an ''MDS file'' because of its implemented file extension ''.mds''. It could also be described as being an [[archive file]] of '''MDS format'''.

== Support ==
MDS files  can be created by [[optical disc]] imaging applications. The MDS file format is primarily utilized by the commercial application [[Alcohol 120%]].  However, it was also used by [[DVD Decrypter]] (now [[ImgBurn]]) which has since been released to [[Macrovision]] by its original author, Lightning UK!. It is presently used in limited fashion by Lightning UK! [[ImgBurn]].  [[Daemon Tools]] also uses this format to mount/emulate MDS files. [[CDemu]] allows the MDS files to be used under Linux. [[CDBurnerXP]] supports copying video CDs and DVDs to MDS files.
