'''Sally Kern''' (born November 27, 1946 in [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]], Arkansas) is an [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma House of Representatives|state legislator]] and former [[schoolteacher]] from [[Oklahoma City]] known for her outspoken public views against homosexuality. On May 2, 2011, she was publicly reprimanded by the House of Representatives for comments she made the preceding week against minorities and women.&lt;ref name=&quot;OKhousesite&quot; /&gt; Kern, a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]], represents House District 84. A former teacher, she graduated from the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] and [[East Texas State University]]. She is married to Steve Kern, pastor of Olivet Baptist Church in the Oklahoma City area&lt;ref name=&quot;OKhousesite&quot;&gt;[http://okhouse.gov/Committees/Member.aspx?MemberID=87 Oklahoma House of Representatives â Sally Kern]&lt;/ref&gt; and has two adult sons.

==Political career==
Kern authored a bill, which passed the [[Oklahoma House of Representatives]] in March 2008, mandating that students who espouse [[Young Earth creationism]] still receive passing grades in [[Earth science]] classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/oese/ |title=Legislative: HB 2211 Passes House Education Committee. Help Defeat this Very Bad Bill! |accessdate=March 11, 2008 |date= |work=Oklahomans for Excellence in Science Education }}&lt;/ref&gt; After being passed in the House, it died in a Senate committee without reaching the floor for debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/oese/ | title = House Bill 2211 (Kern's 'Religious Viewpoints Antidiscrimination Act') Dies In Committee | accessdate=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kern co-authored the Religious Viewpoints Antidiscrimination Act that included the provision &quot;Students shall not be penalized or rewarded on account of the religious content of their work&quot;, which was vetoed by Governor [[Brad Henry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080606_1__World33430 | title = Henry vetoes 'Religious Viewpoints Antidiscrimination Act' | publisher=Tulsa World | accessdate=June 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, she published her memoir ''The Stoning of Sally Kern: The Liberal Attack on Christian Conservatism â and Why We Must Take a Stand''.

==Statements on homosexuality==
In March 2008, Kern made national headlines when she stated:

{{cquote|Studies show that no society that has totally embraced homosexuality has lasted more than, you know, a few decades. So it's the death knell of this country. I honestly think it's the biggest threat our nation has, even more so than terrorism or Islam â which I think is a big threat, okay? 'Cause what's happening now is they are going after, in schools, two-year olds...And this stuff is deadly, and it's spreading, and it will destroy our young people, it will destroy this nation!&lt;ref name=&quot;democracynow&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/3/11/headlines#6 |title=Oklahoma State Rep.: Gays &quot;Biggest Threat&quot; to US |accessdate=March 14, 2008 |date=March 11, 2008 |work=DemocracyNow.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2008/03/10/dnt.ok.lawmaker.anti.gay.kwtv Anti-gay stance hits YouTube: An Oklahoma lawmaker's anti-gay comments are attracting national attention.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After receiving attention for the remarks, Kern said &quot;I said nothing that was not true&quot; and refused to apologize.&lt;ref name=&quot;democracynow&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsok.com/article/3214388/ Kern vows not to apologize for remarks against homosexuals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetout.com/news/article.html?2008/03/10/3 PlanetOut online news]&lt;/ref&gt; She received a standing ovation from fellow Republican legislators in a private meeting a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mick |last=Hinton |title=Kern cites support from GOP |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080311_1_A9_hUnde16804 |work=Tulsa World |date=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Kern's comments, hundreds of [[gay rights|gay]] and [[lesbian rights]] supporters protested at the [[Oklahoma State Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Branson|first=Hailey|title=Oklahoma: Lawmaker's Comments Bring Protest|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/us/19brfs-LAWMAKER8217_BRF.html?ref=us|work=The New York Times|location=New York|page=A17|date=March 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1500 people later turned out at the Capitol to support her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=McNutt |title=Amid Controversy, Kern Gets Support |url=http://newsok.com/article/3224704/1207238655 |work=[[The Oklahoman]] |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kern claimed to have received death threats that caused her to hire a [[bodyguard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bodyguard&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwfa.org/articles/14871/CFI/misc/index.htm |title=State Representative Under Attack by Anti-Christian Homosexual Hate Groups |accessdate=March 16, 2008 |date=March 14, 2008 |work=CWFA.org |publisher=Concerned Women for America |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080412082101/http://www.cwfa.org/articles/14871/CFI/misc/index.htm |archivedate = April 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bodyguard2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080315/31528_Lawmaker_Threatened_for_Comparing_Gay_Lifestyle_to_Terrorism.htm |title=Lawmaker Threatened for Comparing Gay Lifestyle to Terrorism |accessdate=March 16, 2008 |last=Phan |first=Katherine T. |date=March 15, 2008 |work=Christian Post Reporter |publisher=The Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation]] officer who reviewed Kern's emails said, &quot;I wouldn't characterize them as death threats.&quot;&lt;ref name = TulsaWorld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080312_1_A13_hThey04584| title= OSBI Reading Kern E-Mails| last=Hinton| first=Mick| date=March 14, 2008| publisher=Tulsa World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kern authored an op-ed counterpoint piece in the June 24, 2009 issue of the ''Oklahoma Gazette'' in which she argued, &quot;Granting marriage status to homosexuals who comprise little more than 3 percent of the population would be like granting all applicants admission to a prestigious college just because a few meet the qualifications. That schoolâs status would fall. Likewise, the status of marriage will fall if same-sex marriage is legalized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.okgazette.com/p/12738/a/4197/Default.aspx |title= Counterpoint: Preserving Traditional Marriage |last = Kern| first=Sally| date=June 24, 2009 | publisher=Oklahoma Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2009 Kern authored the &quot;[http://ftpcontent.worldnow.com/griffin/NEWS9/PDF/0906/OKMoralityProclamation.pdf Oklahoma Citizens Proclamation for Morality]&quot; implicitly blaming gay marriage and President [[Barack Obama]]'s official acknowledgment of [[Gay and Lesbian Pride Month]] (among other things) for the [[Financial crisis of 2007â2010|economic crisis]] which was then ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=12&amp;articleid=20090702_12_0_hrimgs503529 |title= Kern promotes Oklahoma Morality Proclamation| last = Kern| first=Sally| date=July 2, 2009 | publisher=Tulsa World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her 2010 re-election campaign, Kern made the sexual orientation and gender of her opponent a topic of her campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-lawmaker-sally-kern-supporter-calls-transgender-opponent-a-confused-it/article/3494767|title=Oklahoma lawmaker Sally Kern supporter calls transgender opponent a 'confused it'|first=Michael|last=McNutt|date=September 14, 2010|work=The Oklahoman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]], she conflated homosexuality with HIV/AIDS, and reiterated her claim that homosexuality is a greater threat to the United States than terrorism, saying &quot;Itâs more dangerous, and yes I think that itâs also more dangerous because it will tear down the moral fiber of this nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americansfortruth.com/2011/09/08/aftah-interview-with-oklahoma-state-rep-sally-kern-part-one/ &quot;LISTEN: AFTAH Interview with Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern â Part One&quot; Americans for Truth About Homosexuality; recorded August 31, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements on minorities and women==
On April 27, 2011, while debating in favor of SJR 15, a proposed constitutional amendment that would eliminate [[Affirmative Action]] in Oklahoma, Kern said:
{{cquote|We have a high percentage of blacks in prison, and thatâs tragic, but are they in prison just because they are black or because they donât want to study as hard in school? Iâve taught school, and I saw a lot of people of color who didnât study hard because they said the government would take care of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/04/ok-goper-its-a-fact-that-blacks-dont-work-as-hard.php Oklahoma GOPer: Itâs A Fact That âBlacksâ Donât Work As Hard]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the same debate, Kern also stated that 

{{cquote|Women usually don't want to work as hard as a man... women tend to think a little bit more about their family, wanting to be at home more time, wanting to have a little more leisure time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsok.com/rep.-sally-kerns-comments-on-minorities-and-women-cause-stir/article/3562825|title=Kern apologizes for comments on minorities and women; NAACP says it's not enough|first=Michael McNutt|date=April 29, 2011|work=The Oklahoman}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On May 2, 2011, The Oklahoma State House of Representatives publicly reprimanded Kern for the comments she made against blacks and women during a debate on affirmative action. Rep. Mike Shelton, [[U.S. Democratic Party|D]]-Oklahoma City, made the motion to reprimand her. A member objected, and the House voted 76â17 to reprimand Kern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-house-reprimands-rep.-sally-kern/article/3564084|title=Oklahoma House reprimands Rep.
