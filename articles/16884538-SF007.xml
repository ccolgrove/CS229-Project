'''Moblin''', short for 'mobile [[Linux]]', was an [[open source]] [[operating system]] and application stack for [[Mobile Internet Device]]s (MIDs), [[netbook]]s, [[nettop]]s and embedded devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moblin.org/community/netbooks/moblin_netbook_nettop.php Moblin.org - Mobile Linux Internet Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been merged into the [[MeeGo]] project, and bears its name. Built around the [[Intel Atom]] processor, current builds are designed to minimize boot times and power consumption to create a netbook and MID-centric operating system. The netbook/desktop version of Moblin currently supports other chipsets based on the [[SSSE3]] instruction set, such as the [[Core2]] and some [[Celeron]] processors.

Commercial products built around Moblin 2 include a [[Foxconn]] netbook&lt;ref name=LinpusFoxcon&gt;http://www.slashgear.com/foxconn-sz901-netbook-with-linpus-lite-moblin-v2-video-2945348/&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[InvenTech]] [[smartphone]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midmoves.com/2009/06/mr-blurrycam-spots-a-mediaphone/&lt;/ref&gt;, both announced at [[Computex]] 2009. [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] has also announced the replacement of [[Linpus Linux|Linpus]] Linux with Moblin on their [[Acer Aspire One]] netbooks.&lt;ref name=&quot;LinpusFoxconn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9133889/Acer_will_use_Moblin_Linux_across_its_products IDG News Service &quot;Acer Will Use Moblin Linux Across Its Products&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; For its [[mobile Internet device]] class [[smartphone]]  '''LG GW990''', [[LG Electronics]] chose Moblin OS 2.1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More recently, [[Dell]] began accepting orders for its [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] Moblin Remix, a [[Canonical Ltd.]] project that builds Moblin using a more full-featured Ubuntu distribution as base &lt;ref&gt;http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/09/moblin-2-arriving-via-dell-with-moblin-ubuntu-remix-netbook.ars&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Mandriva]] has started to offer Moblin's v2 version to all Mandriva distribution and netbook owners. &lt;ref name=Mandriva-mini based on Moblin version 2 technology&gt;http://www.mandriva.com/enterprise/en/company/press/mandriva-mini-based-on-moblin-version-2-technology-is-now-available&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2010, MSI and Novell announced the upcoming availability of SUSE Moblin preloaded on the MSI U135 netbook. Following the recent release of Moblin version 2.1, this marks the first original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to sell a fully supported Intel Atom processor-based netbook running Moblin-based technology to consumers. It was demonstrated at both the MSI and Intel booths at the show.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novell.com/news/press/msi-ships-first-netbook-powered-by-suse-moblin-from-novell/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Samsung showed four netbooks preloaded with SUSE Moblin.

At the [[Mobile World Congress]] in February 2010, it was announced that the Moblin project would be merging with [[Maemo]] to create the [[MeeGo]] mobile software platform.

== History ==
[[Intel]] launched the [http://moblin.org Moblin.org] site in July 2007 and significantly updated the site in April 2008 with the launch of the [[Intel Atom]] processor family at the [[Intel Developer Forum]] in Shanghai.  A custom [[software development kit]] (SDK) is available on the site. The Moblin 2 OS was specifically designed to run on an Intel Atom processor in a netbook.&lt;ref&gt;Ganapati, Priya. [http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2009/01/intel-bets-on-m.html &quot;Intel Pushes New Operating System For Netbooks&quot;], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009 Intel turned Moblin over to the [[Linux Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2009/040109-intel-to-turn-moblin-over.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/intel-hands-over-the-keys-to-its-linux-operating-system/ | work=The New York Times | title=Intel Turns Over Its Linux Operating System | first=Ashlee | last=Vance | date=2009-04-01 | accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development is now overseen by the '''Moblin Steering Committee''', currently consisting of Imad Sousou, Arjan van de Ven, Matthew Allum, and Rusty Lynch. Except for Matthew Allum, founder of Intel's recently acquired OpenedHand,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/interview_matthew_allum_openedhand&lt;/ref&gt; all committee members are Intel employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/speaker/26479&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/interview-arjan-van-de-ven-intel-and-lesswattsorg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2007/view/e_spkr/3904&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moblin 2==
At the Linux Collaboration Summit in April 2009, Intel demonstrated that the Moblin 2 alpha release can load major components of the stack, including the graphics system, and start up in mere seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2009/04/intel-aims-for-2-second-boot-time-with-moblin-linux-platform.ars Intel aims for 2-second boot time with Moblin Linux platform]&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 19 2009, Imad Sousou announced the release of Moblin v2.0 beta for Netbooks and Nettops for developer testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moblin.org/community/blogs/imad/2009/moblin-v20-beta-netbooks-and-nettops-its-here Moblin v2.0 beta for Netbooks and Nettops - It's here...]&lt;/ref&gt; Moblin 2's Core distribution is based on recent builds of [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], but other distributions to announce future support for the core Moblin stack include [[Linpus Linux|Linpus]]&lt;ref name=LinpusFoxconn&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2009/06/03/acer-to-join-the-moblin-linux-bandwagon/ Engadget &quot;Acer to join the Moblin Linux&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Ubuntu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Specs/MobileKarmicMoblinRemix Spec of Ubuntu Moblin Remix]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubuntu.com/news/canoical-commits-ubuntu-moblin Canonical announces support for Moblin v2]&lt;/ref&gt;

This second major release marked a shift from the [[Xfce]] [[desktop environment]] to a custom-built [[GNOME Mobile]] UI based on [[OpenedHand]]'s [[Clutter (toolkit)|Clutter]], a key piece of the [[Maemo]] graphical environment, built around the [[X Window System]]. The new UI also includes an integrated [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] web browser.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2009/05/hands-on-intel-brings-rich-ui-to-moblin-linux-platform.ars Hands-on: Intel brings rich UI to Moblin Linux platform] [[Ars Technica]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Register]] was impressed by the interface but noted the presence of &quot;quite a few apparent bugs&quot; and described the beta release of Moblin 2 as &quot;closer to an alpha than a beta.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/06/09/which_linux_for_netbooks/page6.html The best netbook-friendly Linux distros]'' by Andrew Miller of [[The Register]]. June 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Major components ==
* '''Moblin Image Creator''' (MIC): allows developers to create a custom Linux file system for a device.  Using MIC, a platform developer can choose which components from Moblin they want on their device, build the target file system, copy all the necessary files to a [[USB mass storage]] device and load the resulting files onto the target.
* '''Kernel''': platform-specific patches to the [[Linux kernel]] and various other device drivers.
* '''UI Framework''': screen interface and its underlying [[Clutter (toolkit)|Clutter]]- and [[GTK]]-based framework.
* '''Power Management Policy''': extending and enhancing existing Linux power management capabilities
* '''Browser''': the Moblin browser is full-featured web browser based on [[Mozilla]] technologies with a finger-driven UI and MID UI integration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The Moblin browser supports key plug-ins{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} like [[Adobe Flash]].
* '''Multimedia''': audio and video playback and photo viewing including [[Helix (project)|Helix]] or [[GStreamer]] multimedia frameworks with [[Universal Plug and Play]] support through the GUPnP library.
* '''Linux Connection Manager''': [[Internet]] connections that can be extended through plug-ins{{Clarify|date=September 2009}} to support various wired or wireless technologies.

The Intel team has acknowledged that Moblin v2.0 is built using the openSUSE Build Service. {{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Applications==
Moblin 2's interface is designed for netbook and nettops and built on open source graphics technology, such as Clutter, [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|DRI2]], and [[Mode-setting|KMS]], which are designed around toolbars and panels available at the top of the screen.
* Myzone is a variation on the desktop or home screen. It provides an overview of the userâs latest activities on the system. The screen is divided into three areas: recent activities, that is calendar and to-do items (left); recent files and websites, such as pictures viewed and websites visited (center); and recent social network updates, currently tracking Twitter and Last.fm (right).

* A custom toolbar provides more personalized content on the screens it navigates to, than most toolbars do. Most menu items open screens that display the most recently accessed topical content. For example, the work zones panel manages, organizes, and switches to currently running applications and the media panel displays recently played and viewed media files.

* The optimized browser is based on Mozilla browser technology revised into a Clutter shell.

* A 'zoomable' media player allows going from viewing all media at once down to focusing on an individual picture, movie, or audio track. The media player detects and indexes media on external USB devices, as well as UPnP devices on a network.
