The [[Christmas music|holiday album]] comprises teen pop and dance-pop music, while featuring guest appearances from [[Christina Milian]], [[Romeo Miller|Lil' Romeo]] and Duff's sister [[Haylie Duff|Haylie]].

The album peaked at the second position of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[Top Heatseekers]] and [[Top Kid Audio]] charts, and peaked at the 154th position on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for shipping 500,000 copies to retailers.

== Background ==
In 2001, Duff gained fame through her starring role in the [[Disney Channel]] series ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmovie.com/artist/hilary-duff-263869/bio|title=Hilary Duff &gt; Biography|last=Deming|first=Mark|work=[[Allmovie]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became interested in pursuing a music career after attending a [[Radio Disney]] concert in 2001. &quot;There were all these [[Pop music|pop]] acts backstage at the concert,&quot; Duff explained. &quot;They were all getting ready backstage and warming up, and I was like, 'I want to do this so bad.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=Craig|date=January 31, 2004|title=Hilary Duff: A Performer's Metamorphosis|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|volume=116|issue=5|pages=10â14|issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day, Duff met Andre Recke, who would soon become her manager. She told him of her interest in becoming a singer and briefly performed for him. This prompted him to tell her, &quot;I want to work with you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;2007. &quot;At Home with Hilary Duff&quot; featurette on ''[[Dignity (album)|Dignity]]'' deluxe edition DVD. [[Hollywood Records]].&lt;/ref&gt; Recke said of his encounter with Duff, &quot;When I met Hilary, I knew she had something special. Sometimes you just have that feeling, that, 'Wow, she's a star.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen&quot;/&gt;

Duff's music career began with two soundtrack appearances. In 2002, she appeared on the [[Lizzie McGuire (soundtrack)|soundtrack to ''Lizzie McGuire'']], performing a cover of [[Brooke McClymont]]'s &quot;[[I Can't Wait (Brooke McClymont song)#Other versions|I Can't Wait]]&quot;, and the [[Walt Disney Records]] compilation ''[[DisneyMania]]'', performing a cover of &quot;[[The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room]]&quot;. Recke noted of Duff's ''DisneyMania'' appearance, &quot;That was the first test to see how her fans would react to her as a singer and not just an actress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen&quot;/&gt; Duff stated that she felt [[Christmas]] came early for her when she recorded ''Santa Claus Lane''. She continued, &quot;I really loved singing these songs. It was a lot of hard work, but also big fun!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;linernotes&quot;&gt;2002. ''Santa Claus Lane'' (album liner notes).
