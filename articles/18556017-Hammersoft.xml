At present the UN has in total 17&lt;ref&gt;Eckart Klein: ''United Nations, Specialized Agencies'', para.9. In: [http://www.mpepil.com Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law].&lt;/ref&gt; specialized agencies that carry out various functions on behalf of the UN. The specialized agencies are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/structure/index.shtml UN structure and organization, Specialized Agencies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) ==
{{Main|Food and Agriculture Organization}}
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations leads international efforts to defeat hunger. Serving both developed and developing countries, FAO acts as a neutral forum where all nations meet as equals to negotiate agreements and debate policy. FAO's mandate is to raise levels of nutrition, improve agricultural productivity, better the lives of rural populations and contribute to the growth of the world economy. FAO is the largest of UN agencies and its headquarters are in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

== International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) ==
[[File:Flag of ICAO.svg|thumb|ICAO flag.]]
{{Main|International Civil Aviation Organization}}
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was founded in 1947. It codifies the principles and techniques of international air navigation and fosters the planning and development of international [[airline|air transport]] to ensure safe and orderly growth. Its headquarters are located in the [[Quartier international de MontrÃ©al]] of [[Montreal]], [[Canada]].

The ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air navigation, prevention of unlawful interference, and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international [[civil aviation]]. In addition, the ICAO defines the protocols for air accident investigation followed by transport safety authorities in countries signatory to the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation]], commonly known as the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|Chicago Convention]].

== International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) ==
{{Main|International Fund for Agricultural Development}}
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) was established as an international financial institution in 1977, as one of the major outcomes of the 1974 World Food Conference and a response to the situation in the [[Sahel]]. IFAD is dedicated to eradicating rural poverty in developing countries. Its headquarters are in [[Rome]], [[Italy]].

== International Labour Organization (ILO) ==
[[File:Flag of ILO.svg|thumb|ILO flag.]]
{{Main|International Labour Organization}}
The International Labour Organization (ILO) deals with [[labour (economics)|labour]] issues. Its headquarters are in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Founded in 1919, it was formed through the negotiations of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and was initially an agency of the [[League of Nations]]. It became a member of the UN system after the demise of the League and the formation of the UN at the end of World War II. Its Constitution, as amended to date, includes the [[Declaration of Philadelphia]] on the aims and purposes of the Organization. Its secretariat is known as the International Labour Office.

== International Maritime Organization (IMO) ==
[[File:Flag of the International Maritime Organization.svg|thumb|IMO flag.]]
{{Main|International Maritime Organization}}
The International Maritime Organization (IMO), formerly known as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO), was established in 1948 through the United Nations to coordinate international maritime safety and related practices. However the IMO did not enter into full force until 1958.

Headquartered in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], the IMO promotes cooperation among governments and the shipping industry to improve maritime safety and to prevent marine pollution. IMO is governed by an Assembly of members and is financially administered by a Council of members elected from the Assembly. The work of IMO is conducted through five committees and these are supported by technical sub-committees. Member organizations of the UN organizational family may observe the proceedings of the IMO. Observer status may be granted to qualified non-governmental organizations.

The IMO is supported by a permanent secretariat of employees who are representative of its members. The secretariat is composed of a Secretary-General who is periodically elected by the Assembly, and various divisions including, ''inter alia'', marine safety, environmental protection, and a conference section.

== International Monetary Fund (IMF) ==
{{Main|International Monetary Fund}}

International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides monetary cooperation and financial stability and acts as a forum for advice, negotiation and assistance on financial issues. It is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]].

== International Telecommunication Union (ITU) ==
[[File:Flag of ITU.svg|thumb|ITU flag.]]
{{Main|International Telecommunication Union}}
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) was established to standardize and regulate international radio and [[telecommunication]]s. It was founded as the International Telegraph Union in [[Paris]] on 17 May 1865. Its main tasks include [[standardization]], allocation of the [[radio]] spectrum, and organizing interconnection arrangements between different countries to allow international phone calls â in which regard it performs for telecommunications a similar function to what the UPU performs for postal services. It has its headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], next to the main United Nations campus.

== United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ==
[[File:Flag of UNESCO.svg|thumb|UNESCO flag.]]
{{Main|UNESCO}}
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations established in 1946 with its headquarters in [[Paris]], [[France]]. Its stated purpose is to contribute to peace and security by promoting international collaboration through education, science, and culture in order to further universal respect for justice, the rule of law, and the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the UN Charter.

== United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) ==
{{Main|United Nations Industrial Development Organization}}
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations system, headquartered in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The Organization's primary objective is the promotion and acceleration of industrial development in developing countries and countries with economies in transition and the promotion of international industrial cooperation.

UNIDO believes that competitive and environmentally sustainable industry has a crucial role to play in accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The Organization therefore works towards improving the quality of life of the world's poor by drawing on its combined global resources and expertise in the following three interrelated thematic areas:
* Poverty reduction through productive activities;
* Trade capacity-building; and
* Energy and environment.

== Universal Postal Union (UPU) ==
[[File:Flag of UPU.svg|thumb|UPU flag.]]
{{Main|Universal Postal Union}}
The Universal Postal Union (UPU), headquartered in [[Berne]], [[Switzerland]], coordinates postal policies between member nations, and hence the worldwide postal system. Each member country agrees to the same set of terms for conducting international postal duties.

== World Bank Group ==
The World Bank Group comprises a group of five legally separate but affiliated institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Development Association (IDA), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). It is a vital source of financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world. Its mission is to fight poverty with passion and professionalism for lasting results and to help people help themselves and their environment by providing resources, sharing knowledge, [[Capacity building|building capacity]] and forging partnerships in the public and private sectors. Three of the five World Bank Group organizations, namely the IBRD, the IFC, and the IDA, are specialized agencies of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Ragazzi: ''World Bank Group'', para.7. In: [http://www.mpepil.com Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;poligar&lt;/small&gt;=== International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) ===
{{Main|International Bank for Reconstruction and Development}}
The IBRD makes loans to developing countries for development programmes with the stated goal of reducing poverty. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).

=== International Finance Corporation (IFC) ===
{{Main|International Finance Corporation}}
The IFC is the largest multilateral source of loan and equity financing for private sector projects in the developing world. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).

=== International Development Association (IDA) ===
{{Main|International Development Association}}
The IDA's mandate is close to that of IBRD, with the focus on the poorest countries. It is part of the World Bank Group (WBG).

== World Health Organization (WHO) ==
[[File:Flag of WHO.svg|thumb|WHO flag.]]
{{Main|World Health Organization}}
The World Health Organization (WHO) acts as a coordinating authority on international public health. Established on 7 April 1948, and headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], the agency inherited the mandate and resources of its predecessor, the Health Organization, which had been an agency of the League of Nations.

== World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) ==
{{Main|World Intellectual Property Organization}}
The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations created in 1967 and headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Its purpose is to encourage creative activity and to promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the world. The organisation administers several treaties concerning the protection of [[intellectual property]] rights.

== World Meteorological Organization (WMO) ==
[[File:Flag of the World Meteorological Organization.svg|thumb|WMO flag.]]
{{Main|World Meteorological Organization}}

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), which was founded in 1873. Established in 1950, WMO became the specialized agency of the United Nations for meteorology (weather and climate), operational hydrology and related geophysical sciences. It has its headquarters in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

== World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) ==
{{Main|World Tourism Organization}}

The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) was established in 1946 in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], to replace the International Union of Official Tourist Propaganda Organization (IUOTPO). UNWTO has 160 member states and 350 affiliated members representing private organizations, educational institutions and others. It is headquartered in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The World Tourism Organization serves as a forum for tourism policies and acts as a practical source for tourism know-how.

== Former specialized agencies ==
The only UN specialized agency to go out of existence is the [[International Refugee Organization]], which existed from 1946 to 1952. In 1952, it was replaced by the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], which is a subsidiary organ of the [[United Nations General Assembly]].

== Related and comparable organizations ==
There are many other intergovernmental organizations that have concluded cooperation agreements with the United Nations. In terms of cooperation structures, some agreements come very close to the relationship agreements concluded under articles 57 and 63 of the UN Charter. This is why these organizations are called ''related organizations'', but due to lack of formalities required by articles 57 and 63, they are not specialized agencies of the United Nations.

=== International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ===
[[File:Flag of IAEA.svg|thumb|IAEA flag.]]
{{Main|International Atomic Energy Agency}}

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an intergovernmental organization for scientific and technical cooperation in the field of [[nuclear power|nuclear]] technology. It seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for [[nuclear weapon|military purposes]]. The IAEA was set up as an autonomous organization in 29 July 1957. Prior to this, in 1953, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] envisioned the creation of this international body to control and develop the use of atomic energy, in his &quot;''[[Atoms for Peace]]''&quot; speech before the UN General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/About/history.html About IAEA: History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The organization and its former Director General, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] announced on 7 October 2005. Its current membership is 144 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/About/by_the_numbers.html About IAEA: By the Numbers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to historical reasons and the political nature of its work, the IAEA is not a specialized agency. Instead, its relationship to the United Nations is governed by a special agreement as well as by its statute that commits the IAEA to report annually to the General Assembly and, when appropriate, to the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;Johan Rautenbach: ''International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'', para.2. In: [http://www.mpepil.com Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Trade Organization (WTO) ===
{{Main|World Trade Organization}}
The WTO was established instead of the failed proposal for a specialized agency dealing with [[international trade|trade issues]], the [[International Trade Organization]]. headquarter is in Geneva, Switzerland.

=== Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ===
