{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull''}}
'''''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull''''' is a 2008 American [[adventure science fiction]] film. It is the fourth film in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]], created by [[George Lucas]] and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. Released nineteen years after [[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade|the previous film]], the film acknowledges its star [[Harrison Ford]]'s age by being set in 1957. It pays tribute to the [[B movies (Transition in the 1950s)|science fiction B-movies of the era]], pitting [[Indiana Jones]] against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agentsâled by Irina Spalko ([[Cate Blanchett]])&amp;mdash;for a psychic alien [[crystal skull]]. Indiana is aided by his former lover [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]) and their son [[Mutt Williams]] ([[Shia LaBeouf]]). [[Ray Winstone]], [[John Hurt]] and [[Jim Broadbent]] are also part of the supporting cast.

Screenwriters [[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]], [[Jeffrey Boam]], [[Frank Darabont]] and [[Jeff Nathanson]] wrote drafts before [[David Koepp]]'s script satisfied the producers. Shooting began on June 18, 2007 and took place in various locations: New Mexico, New Haven, Connecticut, Hawaii, Fresno, California and on soundstages in Los Angeles. To keep aesthetic continuity with the previous films the crew relied on traditional stunt work instead of computer-generated stunt doubles and [[cinematographer]] [[Janusz KamiÅski]] studied [[Douglas Slocombe]]'s style from the previous films.

Marketing relied heavily on the public's nostalgia for the series, with products taking inspiration from all four films. Anticipation for the film was heightened by secrecy, which resulted in a legal dispute over an extra violating his [[non-disclosure agreement]] and the arrest of another man for stealing a computer containing various documents related to the production. ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was released worldwide on May 22, 2008, and was a financial success, grossing over $786 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of the franchise, the second highest-grossing film of 2008 and the third highest-grossing film ever produced by [[Lucasfilm]] when not adjusted for inflation, after ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]''.

&lt;!-- Wikipedia:WikiProject Films/Style guidelines states this section's length should be kept around 700 words.--&gt;
In 1957, [[World War II]] hero Indiana Jones and his long-time partner [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Mac|George &quot;Mac&quot; McHale]] are kidnapped by a group of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents led by the mysterious [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Irina Spalko|Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko]]. The Soviets infiltrate a warehouse labeled &quot;[[Area 51|51]]&quot; in [[Nevada]] and force &quot;Dr. Jones&quot; to find a crate containing the remains of an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] being that [[Roswell UFO incident|crashed ten years prior]] near [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. After finding the crateâits contents possessing [[magnetism|magnetic]] propertiesâMac double-crosses Indiana, having been bought off by the Soviets. After a fight with the Soviets, Indiana manages to escape into the desert (though not before the crate containing the [[Ark of the Covenant]] from ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' is revealed in the same warehouse); he then stumbles upon a [[Nevada Test Site|nuclear test town]] and survives a nuclear explosion by hiding in a [[lead]]-lined refrigerator. He is later debriefed by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] because of Mac's Soviet ties. Shortly after returning to [[Marshall College]], Indiana is offered an indefinite leave of absence to avoid being fired because of the incident.

At a train station, Indiana is stopped by [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] Henry &quot;Mutt&quot; Williams, who tells him that his old colleague [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#Harold Oxley|Harold Oxley]] was kidnapped after discovering a [[crystal skull]] in [[Peru]]. Indiana proceeds to tell Mutt the legend of a [[crystal skull]] found in the mystical city of [[El Dorado|Akator]], in which whoever returns the skull to the city would be given control over its supernatural powers. Mutt gives Indiana a letter from his mother, who was also kidnapped, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] language, which leads them to the [[Nazca Lines]] in Peru. There they discover that Oxley was incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital, having suffered a mental breakdown from the powers of the skull, until he was kidnapped by the Soviets. In Oxley's cell, they find clues that lead them to the grave of [[Francisco de Orellana]], a [[Conquistador]] who went missing in the 16th century while searching for Akator. They discover the skull at the grave, with Indiana reasoning that Oxley had hidden it there after finding it.

Shortly afterward, Indiana and Mutt are captured by the Soviets and taken to their camp, where they find Oxley and Mutt's mother, who turns out to be Indiana's old love, Marion Ravenwood, and reveals that Mutt is Indiana's son, Henry Jones III. Spalko believes that the crystal skull belongs to an [[Extraterrestrial life|interdimensional being]] and holds great [[psychic]] power, and reveals that the specimen stolen from the warehouse is also a crystal skull. She also believes that returning the skull to Akator will grant the Soviets the advantage of psychic warfare. Indiana, Marion, Mutt and Oxley manage to escape from the Soviets into the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]]; however, they are recaptured after Indiana falls into a swamp and Oxley fetches the Soviets for help, and with their hands tied taken to the city [[temple]] through the Rainforest. Marion and Indiana argue so much that the Soviet guard finally gags Marion with a cloth. However, Indiana and Mutt manage to overpower him while he does this. Indiana frees himself with a hidden knife of Mutt's. He ungags Marion, then Mutt frees her while Indiana throws out the driver. A fight ensues (displaying Spalko's [[fencing]] prowess), but only after evading the Soviets again during a brush with [[Siafu|siafu ants]], negotiating three waterfalls in a [[Amphibious vehicle|duck]], and nearly being killed by an elusive tribe living in the long-abandoned city, are they able to enter the temple. Mac, who claims to be a [[double agent]] (to Indiana's bewilderment, questioning his loyalty), secretly leaves a trail for the Soviets to follow.

Inside the temple, they find artifacts from several [[Civilization|ancient civilizations]]. Indiana deduces that the creatures were kindred spirits; they too were &quot;[[Ancient astronauts|archaeologists]]&quot; studying the different cultures of [[Earth]]. The five enter a chamber containing the crystal skeletons of thirteen interdimensional beings seated on thrones in a circle, one missing a skull. After the Soviets arrive, Spalko places the skull onto the headless skeleton. They begin communicating to the group through Oxley in an ancient dialect, promising to reward them with a &quot;big gift&quot;; Spalko approaches them and demands to &quot;know everything&quot;. The skeletons grant her request and psychically transfer their collective knowledge into her mind, activating a [[Portals in fiction|portal]] to another dimension. Indiana, Marion, Mutt and the now-sane Oxley escape the temple, but Mac and the other Soviets are sucked into the portal. The skeletons, meanwhile, combine to form a single living interdimensional being which overwhelms Spalko, causing her to disintegrate; her scattered essence is then drawn into the portal. The temple crumbles and reveals a massive fast-spinning [[flying saucer]] slowly rising from the debris (thought to be buried for millennia, the aliens &quot;instructing&quot; the [[human]] ancestors to build a city on top of it to hide it from plain sight); the survivors watch as it hovers in the atmosphere, defying the [[laws of physics]] and disappears into the cosmos in a split second, the &quot;space between spaces&quot;. Indiana, amazed by the spectacle but also overwhelmed by the sudden turn of events, is now happily reconciled with his new family.

Not long afterward, Indiana, now reinstated and made an associate dean at Marshall College, marries Marion. At the wedding's conclusion, a sudden wind bursts through the church doors and blows Indiana's hat onto the floor at Mutt's feet. Mutt picks it up and is about to place it on his head, only to have his father grab and put it on as he and his wife walk down the aisle.

His physicality is a big part of it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places.

* [[Shia LaBeouf]] plays [[List of Indiana Jones characters#Mutt Williams|Henry &quot;Mutt Williams&quot; Jones III]], a motorcycle-riding greaser and Indiana's sidekick and son. The concept of Indiana Jones having offspring was introduced in ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'', in which Old Indy is shown to have a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;''The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles'', &quot;Ireland, April 1916&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; During development of ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', this idea was incorporated into [[Frank Darabont]]'s script, with Indiana and Marion having a 13-year-old daughter. However, Spielberg found this too similar to ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'',&lt;ref name=atomicants&gt;Rinzler, Bouzereau, Chapter 11: &quot;Atomic Ants from Space: May 1989 to June 2007&quot; p. 231â247&lt;/ref&gt; so a son was created instead.&lt;ref name=legend&gt;''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' DVD special features: ''The Return of a Legend''&lt;/ref&gt; Koepp credited the character's creation to [[Jeff Nathanson]] and Lucas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koeppmag&quot;/&gt; Koepp wanted to make Mutt into a nerd, but Lucas refused, explaining he had to resemble [[Marlon Brando]] in ''[[The Wild One]]''; &quot;he needs to be what Indiana Jones' father thought of [him]&amp;nbsp;â the curse returns in the form of his own son&amp;nbsp;â he's everything a father can't stand&quot;.&lt;ref name=atomicants /&gt; LaBeouf was Spielberg's first choice for the role, having been impressed by his performance in ''[[Holes (film)|Holes]]''.&lt;ref name=pre/&gt; Excited at the prospect of being in an Indiana Jones film, LaBeouf signed on without reading the script and did not know what character he would play.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Anthony Breznican | title = Shia LaBeouf tapped for 'Indy 4' role | publisher = USA Today | date = 2007-04-13 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2007-04-12-shia-indiana-jones_N.htm?csp=34 | accessdate = 2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked out and gained fifteen pounds of muscle for the role,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Aaron Parsley | title = Shia LaBeouf: How I'm Getting Buff for Indiana Jones | publisher = People | date = 2007-04-23 | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20036458,00.html | accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also repeatedly watched the other films to get into character.&lt;ref name=shootingstart&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.indianajones.com/site/index.html?deeplink=videos/1/v18 | title=New Indy Adventure Begins Shooting | accessdate=2008-04-08 | date=2007-06-18 | publisher=IndianaJones.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaBeouf also watched ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'', ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' and ''[[The Wild One]]'' to get into his character's mindset,&lt;ref name=pre/&gt; copying mannerisms and words from characters in those films, such as the use of a [[switchblade]] as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Nick de Semlyen | title = Shia LaBeouf is Indiana Jones Jr. | publisher = Empire | date = April 2008 | pages = 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas also consulted on the greaser look, joking that LaBeouf was &quot;sent to the ''[[American Graffiti]]'' school of greaserland.&quot;&lt;ref name=titans/&gt; LaBeouf pulled his [[rotator cuff]] when filming his duel with Spalko, which was his first injury in his career, an injury which worsened throughout filming.

* [[Cate Blanchett]] plays the villainous Soviet agent [[Irina Spalko]].

He noted, &quot;There's no aspect of her behavior that was not consistent with this bizarre person she's playing.&quot;&lt;ref name=ford/&gt;

* [[Karen Allen]] reprises the role of [[Marion Ravenwood]], under the married name of Marion Williams, who appeared in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Frank Darabont's script introduced the idea of Marion Ravenwood returning as Indiana's love interest.&lt;ref name=atomicants/&gt; Allen was not aware her character was in the script until Spielberg called her in January 2007, saying, &quot;It's been announced!

She's a completely self-sufficient woman, and that's part of the character she plays. A lot of her charm and the charm of the character is there. And again, it's not an age-dependent thing. It has to do with her spirit and her nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=ford/&gt; Allen found Ford easier to work with on this film, in contrast to the first film, where she slowly befriended the private actor.&lt;ref name=glory&gt;{{cite news | author = Matthew Leyland | title = Fortune and Glory | publisher = Total Film | date = June 2008 | pages = 68â71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Ray Winstone]] plays George &quot;Mac&quot; McHale, a British agent whom Jones worked alongside in World War II, but has now allied with the Russians due to his financial problems. The character acts as a spin on [[Sallah]] and [[List of characters in the Indiana Jones series#RenÃ© Belloq|RenÃ© Belloq]] - Jones's friend and nemesis, respectively, in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.&lt;ref name=&quot;villainess&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author = Shawn Adler | title = 'Indiana Jones' Roles For Cate Blanchett, Ray Winstone Revealed Exclusively To MTV News | publisher = MTV | date = 2007-12-07 | url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576038/20071207/story.jhtml | accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg cast Winstone as he found him &quot;one of the most brilliant actors around&quot;, having seen ''[[Sexy Beast]]''.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Production | publisher = Official site | url = http://www.indianajones.com/site/index.html | format = Flash | accessdate=2008-05-14}} To access, click &quot;The Film&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Winstone tore his [[hamstring]] during filming. &quot;I keep getting these action parts as Iâm getting older,&quot; he remarked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Kim Gregory | title = Ray Winstone thinks Cate Blanchett is the best actress in the world | publisher = Showbiz Spy | date = 2008-02-15 | url = http://www.showbizspy.com/2008/02/15/ray-winstone-thinks-cate-blanchett-is-the-best-actress-in-the-world/ | accessdate=2008-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like John Hurt, Winstone wished to see the script prior to committing to the film. In interviews on British TV&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Soccer AM&quot; (Sky Sports 1) and &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; (BBC1)&lt;/ref&gt; Winstone explained that he was only able to read the script if it was delivered by courier, who waited while he read the script, and returned to the US with the script once Winstone had read it. His reasoning for wanting to read the script was, &quot;If I'm gonna be in it, I want to ''be'' in it.&quot; He gave suggestions to Spielberg, including the idea of Mac pretending to be a [[double agent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myparkmag.co.uk/articles/celebrity/ray-winstones-spielberg-suggestions.html|title=Ray Winstone's Spielberg suggestions|work=My Park magazine|date=2008-12-27|accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that once filming was completed he had to return the script, such was the secrecy about the film. He was later presented with a copy of the script to keep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, BBC1, May 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[John Hurt]] plays Harold &quot;Ox&quot; Oxley, Mutt's surrogate father and an old friend of Indiana, whom he lost contact with in 1937. Six months prior to the events of the film, he went insane after discovering the crystal skull, which commanded him to return it to Akator. Frank Darabont had suggested Hurt when he was writing the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Shawn Adler|title=Frank Darabont Expects Fight Over âIndy IVâ Writing Credits|publisher=MTV|date=2007-11-12|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2007/11/12/frank-darabont-expects-fight-over-indy-iv-writing-credits/|accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is inspired by Ben Gunn from ''[[Treasure Island]]''.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; Hurt wanted to read the script before signing on, unlike other cast members who came on &quot;because Steven&amp;nbsp;â you know, 'God'&amp;nbsp;â was doing it. And I said, 'Well, I need to have a little bit of previous knowledge even if God is doing it.' So they sent a [[courier]] over with the script from Los Angeles, gave it to me at three o'clock in the afternoon in London, collected it again at eight o'clock in the evening, and he returned the next day to Los Angeles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;peru&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author = Matt Mueller | title = Q&amp;A Exclusive: John Hurt on 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' | publisher = Premiere | date = 2007-12-20 | url = http://www.premiere.com/features/4335/q-a-exclusive-john-hurt-on-indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull.html  | accessdate=2008-12-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080208231813/http://www.premiere.com/features/4335/q-a-exclusive-john-hurt-on-indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull.html |archivedate = 2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Jim Broadbent]] plays Dean Charles Stanforth, an academic colleague and friend of Jones. Broadbent's character stands in for [[Marcus Brody]], whose portrayer, [[Denholm Elliott]], died in 1992.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; As a tribute to Elliott, the filmmakers put a portrait and a statue on the Marshall College location, and a picture on Jones' desk, saying he died shortly after Indiana's father.

* [[Igor Jijikine]] plays the Russian Colonel Dovchenko. His character stands in for the heavily built henchman [[Pat Roach]] played in the previous films (Roach died in 2004).&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

[[Joel Stoffer]] and [[Neil Flynn]] have minor roles as FBI agents interrogating Indiana in a scene following the opening sequence. [[Alan Dale]] plays General Ross, who protests his innocence. [[Andrew Divoff]] and [[Pavel Lychnikoff]] play Russian soldiers.

{{Quote_box|width=40%|align=right|quote=&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;''Indiana Jones and the Saucer Men from Mars'' script by [[Jeb Stuart (writer)|Jeb Stuart]], dated February 20, 1995:
The second draft's prologue is set in [[Borneo]] in 1949, with Indiana proposing to Dr. Elaine McGregor after defeating pirates. She abandons him at the altar, because the government requests her aid in decoding an alien cylinder (covered in Egyptian, Mayan and Sanskrit symbols) in New Mexico. Indiana pursues her, and battles Russians agents and aliens for the cylinder.

The script featured [[army ant]]s, a [[rocket sled]] fight, Indiana surviving an atomic explosion by sealing himself in a fridge, and a climactic battle between the US military and flying saucers. Henry Jones, Sr., [[Short Round]], Sallah, Marion Ravenwood and [[Willie Scott (Indiana Jones character)|Willie]] cameo at Indiana and Elaine's wedding(s). Indiana is also a former colonel and was assigned to the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bellosh | title = Raiders of the Lost Drafts | publisher = TheRaider.net | date = 2001-01-16 | url = http://www.theraider.net/features/articles/lost_drafts_05.php | accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;}}

During the late 1970s, [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] made a deal with [[Paramount Pictures]] for five Indiana Jones films.&lt;ref&gt;Rinzler, Bouzereau, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1989 release of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Lucas let the series end as he felt he could not think of a good [[plot device]] to drive the next installment, and chose instead to produce ''The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles'' for TV, which explored the character in his early years.&lt;ref name=atomicants /&gt; Harrison Ford played Indiana in one episode, narrating his adventures in 1920 Chicago. When Lucas shot Ford's role in December 1992, he realized the scene opened up the possibility of a film with an older Indiana set in the 1950s. The film could reflect a science fiction 1950s B-movie, with aliens as the plot device.&lt;ref name=atomicants /&gt; Meanwhile, Spielberg believed he was going to &quot;mature&quot; as a filmmaker after making the trilogy, and felt he would just produce any future installments.&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;

Ford disliked the new angle, telling Lucas, &quot;No way am I being in a Steven Spielberg movie like that.&quot;&lt;ref name=untold /&gt; Spielberg himself, who depicted aliens in ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', resisted it. Lucas came up with a story, which Jeb Stuart turned into a script from October 1993 to May 1994.&lt;ref name=atomicants/&gt; (Stuart had previously written ''The Fugitive,'' which starred Ford.) Lucas wanted Indiana to get married, which would allow Henry Jones, Sr. to return, expressing concern over whether his son is happy with what he has accomplished. After he learned that [[Joseph Stalin]] was interested in psychic warfare, he decided to have Russians as the villains and the aliens to have psychic powers.&lt;ref name=commentary&gt;Rinzler, Bouzereau, &quot;Script draft by David Koepp summary and commentary: April 23, 2007&quot;, p. 248â255&lt;/ref&gt; Following Stuart's next draft, Lucas hired ''Last Crusade'' writer [[Jeffrey Boam]] to write the next three versions, the last of which was completed in March 1996. Three months later, ''[[Independence Day (film)|Independence Day]]'' was released, and Spielberg told Lucas he would not make another alien invasion film. Lucas decided to focus on the ''Star Wars'' prequels''.&lt;ref name=atomicants /&gt;

In 2000, Spielberg's son asked when the next Indiana Jones film would be released, which made him interested in reviving the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;curse&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author = Ann Donahue | title = Indiana Jones and the Curse of Development Hell | publisher = [[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] |date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Ford, Lucas, Spielberg, [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] and [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] met during the [[American Film Institute]]'s tribute to Ford, and decided they wanted to enjoy the experience of making an Indiana Jones film again. Spielberg also found returning to the series a respite from his many dark films during this period, such as ''A.I.: Artificial Intelligence,'' ''Minority Report,'' and ''Munich''.&lt;ref name=glory/&gt; Lucas convinced Spielberg to use aliens in the plot by saying they were not &quot;extraterrestrials,&quot; but &quot;[[Multiverse|interdimensional]],&quot; with this concept taking inspiration in the [[superstring theory]].&lt;ref name=legend/&gt; Spielberg and Lucas discussed the central idea of a B-movie involving aliens, and Lucas suggested using the [[crystal skull]]s to ground the idea. Lucas found those artifacts as fascinating as the [[Ark of the Covenant]],&lt;ref name=keys&gt;{{Cite news | author = Jim Windolf | title = Keys to the Kingdom | publisher = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date = February 2008 | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indianajones200802 | accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had intended to feature them for a ''Young Indiana Jones'' episode before the show's cancellation.&lt;ref name=atomicants/&gt; [[M.

Spielberg decided he could not satirize the Nazis after directing ''[[Schindler's List]]'',&lt;ref name=titans/&gt; while Ford noted, &quot;We plum[b] wore the Nazis out.&quot;&lt;ref name=untold/&gt;

[[Jeff Nathanson]] met with Spielberg and Lucas in August 2004, and turned in the next drafts in October and November 2005, titled ''The Atomic Ants''. [[David Koepp]] continued on from there, giving his script the subtitle ''Destroyer of Worlds'',&lt;ref name=atomicants/&gt; based on the [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] quote. It was changed to ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', as Spielberg found it more inviting a title and actually named the plot device of the crystal skulls. Lucas insisted on the ''Kingdom'' part.&lt;ref name=wild&gt;Rinzler, Bouzereau, Chapter 12: &quot;Mr. Jones's Wild Ride: June to December 2007&quot;, p. 254â295&lt;/ref&gt; Koepp's &quot;bright [title] idea&quot; was ''Indiana Jones and the Son of Indiana Jones'', and Spielberg had also considered having the title name the aliens as ''[[The Mysterians]]'', but dropped that when he remembered that was the name of a film.&lt;ref name=legend/&gt; Koepp collaborated with ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' screenwriter [[Lawrence Kasdan]] on the film's &quot;love dialogue.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Koeppmag&quot; /&gt;

=== Filming ===
[[Image:Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.jpg|thumb|The production crew converts a storefront in downtown New Haven, Connecticut to be used in a scene set in the 1950s.]]
Unlike the previous Indiana Jones films, Spielberg shot the entire film in the United States, stating he did not want to be away from his family.&lt;ref name=lucasqaa/&gt; Shooting began on June 18, 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;shootingstart&quot; /&gt; at [[Deming, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isle&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author=John Burnett | title=Ford lands on Big Isle | publisher=Hawaii Tribune-Herald | date=2007-07-11 | url=http://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/articles/2007/07/11/local_news/local07.txt | accessdate=2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive chase scene set at Indiana Jones's fictional Marshall College was filmed between June 28 and July 7 at [[Yale University]] in New Haven, Connecticut (where Spielberg's son Theo was studying).&lt;ref name=&quot;isle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;path&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author=Ed Stannard | title=Casting call creates excitement far and wide | publisher=New Haven Register | date=2007-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fandango/&gt; To keep in line with the fact the story takes place in the 1950s, several facades were changed, although signs were put up in between shots to tell the public what the store or restaurant actually was.

=== Design ===
Spielberg and [[Janusz KamiÅski]], who has shot all of the director's films since 1993's ''Schindler's List'', reviewed the previous films to study [[Douglas Slocombe]]'s style. &quot;I didnât want Janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century,&quot; Spielberg explained. &quot;I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz and I had to swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer's look, and I had to approximate this younger director's look that I thought I had moved away from after almost two decades.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;keys&quot; /&gt; Spielberg also hired production designer [[Guy Hendrix Dyas]] after admiring his design work for ''[[Superman Returns]]''. Spielberg did not want to [[fast cutting|fast cut]] action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace,&lt;ref name=&quot;keys&quot; /&gt; and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted.&lt;ref name=&quot;lie&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Come Lie With Me | pages= 80â1 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=2003-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas felt &quot;it looks like it was shot three years after ''Last Crusade''. The people, the look of it, everything. Youâd never know there was 20 years between shooting.&quot;&lt;ref name=lucasqaa&gt;{{cite news | author = Jim Windolf | title = Q&amp;A: George Lucas | publisher = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] | date = 2008-01-02 | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/lucas_qanda200802?currentPage=4 | accessdate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; KamiÅski commented upon watching the three films back-to-back, he was amazed how each of them advanced technologically, but were all nevertheless consistent, neither too brightly or darkly lit.&lt;ref name=pre&gt;''Pre-production'' DVD featurette, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

While shooting ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' in late 2004, Spielberg met with stunt coordinator [[Vic Armstrong]], who doubled for Ford in the previous films, to discuss three action sequences he had envisioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;race against time&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author=Nick de Semlyen, Ian Freer, Chris Hewitt, Ian Nathan, Sam Toy | title = A Race Against Time: Indiana Jones IV | pages = 100 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=2006-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Armstrong was filming ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]'' during shooting of ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', so [[Dan Bradley]] was hired instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Is Dan Bradley stunt coordinator for Indy 4? | publisher = TheRaider.net | date = 2007-09-04 | url = http://www.theraider.net/news/fullstory_indy4.php?id=308 | accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley and Spielberg used [[previsualization]] for all the action scenes, except the motorcycle chase at Marshall College, because that idea was conceived after the animators had left. Bradley drew traditional [[storyboard]]s instead, and was given free rein to create dramatic moments, just as ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' [[second unit]] director [[Michael D. Moore]] did when filming the truck chase.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Ian Freer]] | title = The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = May 2008 | pages = 80&amp;nbsp;â 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg improvised on set, changing the location of Mutt and Spalko's duel from the ground to on top of vehicles.&lt;ref name=pre/&gt;

The [[Ark of the Covenant]] is seen in a broken crate during the Hangar 51 opening sequence. Lucasfilm used the same prop from ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. Guards were hired to protect the highly-sought after piece of film memorabilia during the day of its use. A replica of the staff carried by [[Charlton Heston]] in ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' was also used to populate the set to illustrate the Hangar's history.&lt;ref name=wild/&gt;

=== Effects ===
[[Image:IJandthefakeleaves.jpg|thumb|250px|Stunts involving vehicles were shot on location in Hawaii, while CGI was used to add plants to the forest]]
Producer Frank Marshall stated in 2003 that the film would use traditional stunt work so as to be consistent with the previous films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Exclusive: B-Movie Feel For Indy IV | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date=2003-09-09 | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?nid=11918|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip).&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. However, it did not go off and he was not injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Chrissy Iley | title = Keeping up with Indiana Jones | publisher = [[The Observer]] | date = 2008-04-27 | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,2275988,00.html | accessdate=2008-04-30 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Spielberg stated before production began that very few CGI effects would be used to maintain consistency with the other films. During filming however, significantly more CGI work was done than initially anticipated as in many cases it proved to be more practical. There ended up being a total of about 450 CGI shots in the film, with an estimated 30 percent of the film's shots containing CG [[matte painting]]s.&lt;ref name=windingdown/&gt; Spielberg initially wanted brushstrokes to be visible on the paintings for added consistency with the previous films, but decided against it.&lt;ref name=untold/&gt; The script also required a non-deforested jungle for a chase scene, but this would have been unsafe and much CGI work was done to create the jungle action sequence. [[Visual effects supervisor]] Pablo Helman (who worked on Lucas' ''[[Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' as well as Spielberg's ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' and ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'') traveled to Brazil and Argentina to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. Industrial Light and Magic then effectively created a virtual jungle with a geography like the real Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Derrik J. Lang/[[Associated Press]] | title = 'Indiana Jones' and the computer-generated jungle | work = [[Seattle Times]] | date = 2008-05-22 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/movies/2004430694_apfilmindyeffects.html | accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of a live alien and flying saucer was in flux. Spielberg wanted the alien to resemble a [[Gray alien]], and also rejected early versions of the saucer that looked &quot;too ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind|Close Encounters]]''&quot;. Art director Christian Alzmann said the aesthetic was &quot;looking at a lot of older B-movie designs&amp;nbsp;â but trying to make that look more real and gritty to fit in with the Indy universe.&quot; Other reference for the visual effects work included government tapes of nuclear tests, and video reference of real [[prairie dog]]s shot in 1080p by Nathan Edward Denning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Patrick Kolan|title=The Indiana Jones 4 Post-Mortem|work=[[IGN]]|date=2008-10-29|url=http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/925/925408p1.html|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Marshall remarked, &quot;In today's information age, secrecy has been a real challenge. [...] People actually said, 'No, we're going to respect Steven's vision.&quot; Fans on the internet have scrutinized numerous photos and the film's promotional [[LEGO]] sets in hope of understanding plot details; Spielberg biographer [[Ian Freer]] wrote, &quot;What ''Indy IV'' is actually about has been the great cultural guessing game of 2007/08. Yet, it has to be said, there is something refreshing about being ten weeks away from a giant blockbuster and knowing next to nothing about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=empire/&gt; To distract investigative fans from the film's title during filming,&lt;ref name=&quot;decision&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | author = Robert Sanchez | title = IESB Chats with The Master&amp;nbsp;â Steven Spielberg! | publisher = IESB | date = 2008-10-09 | url = http://www.iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3450&amp;Itemid=99 | accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; five fake titles were registered with the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]; ''The City of Gods'', ''The Destroyer of Worlds'', ''The Fourth Corner of the Earth'', ''The Lost City of Gold'' and ''The Quest for the Covenant''.&lt;ref name=&quot;titles&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = The 25 Most Exciting Movies of 2008 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/features/25_most_exciting_movies_of_2008/default.asp | accessdate=2008-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas and Spielberg had also wanted to keep Karen Allen's return a secret until the film's release, but decided to confirm it at the 2007 [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | title = Indiana casting a surprise for Allen | publisher = [[Television New Zealand]] | url = http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411749/1764589 | accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Indiana Jones'' is distributed by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, [[Lucasfilm]]. The pre-production arrangement between the two organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than the original $125 million estimate,&lt;ref name=&quot;titles&quot; /&gt; Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount could cover the film's costs. In order for Paramount to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film had to make over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and those with smaller profit-sharing deals would also begin to collect their cut.&lt;ref name=treasure&gt;{{cite news | author = Claudia Eller | title = Ford, Lucas, Spielberg on risky quest for treasure | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2008-04-21 | url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-indianajones21apr21,1,4784324.story | accessdate=2008-04-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080422143034/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-indianajones21apr21,1,4784324.story |archivedate = April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception ===
The film received mostly positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that 77% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 246 reviews.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, a rating he also gave to ''The Last Crusade''.

However, the ''[[Associated Press]]'' reported the film received a &quot;respectful&amp;nbsp;â though far from glowing&amp;nbsp;â reception,&quot; saying that &quot;some viewers at its first press screening loved it, some called it slick and enjoyable though formulaic, some said it was not worth the 19-year wait,&quot; adding that J.

''[[USA Today]]'' stated reviews were &quot;mixed&quot; and reviewers felt the &quot;movie suffers from predictable plot points and cheesy special effects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Scott Bowles | title = 'Indiana Jones' gets mixed reviews on the Web | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = 2008-05-11 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2008-05-11-indy-web-reviews_N.htm | accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critic [[James Berardinelli]] gave the film 2 stars out of 4, calling it &quot;the most lifeless of the series&quot; and &quot;simply [not] a very good motion picture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[James Berardinelli]] | title = Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull | publisher = Reel Views | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/i/indiana_jones4.html | accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Pomeranz of ''[[At the Movies (Australian TV series)|At the Movies]]'' gave the film 2 1/2 stars out of 5, saying that the filmmakers &quot;had 19 years since the last Indiana Jones movie to come up with something truly exciting and fresh, but I feel thereâs a certain laziness and cynicism in this latest adventure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s2258196.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Metacritic user ratings for the film (as opposed to critics' ratings) rank at only 5.1 out of 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metacritic&quot;/&gt;

Some fans of the franchise who were disappointed with the film adopted the term &quot;[[nuking the fridge|nuked the fridge]],&quot; based on a scene in the film where Indiana Jones survives a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator, which then blows Jones miraculously all the way to safety. To users of the phrase, the phrase denotes the point in a movie series when it has passed its peak and crossed into the level of the absurd, similar to &quot;[[jumping the shark]]&quot; on television. This phrase has since appeared across the Internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.newsweek.com/id/143782 | title=âJump the Shark,â Meet âNuke the Fridgeâ | date = 2008-07-14 | work=[[Newsweek]] | accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was chosen as #5 on [[Time Magazine]]'s list of &quot;top ten buzzwords&quot; of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2008/top10/article/0,30583,1855948_1864100_1864105,00.html | work=Time | title=The Top 10 Everything Of 2008 | date=2008-11-03 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[South Park]]'' parodied the film in the episode &quot;[[The China Probrem]],&quot; broadcast five months after the film's release. The episode was highly critical of the movie, with the characters filing a police report against Lucas and Spielberg for [[raping]] Indiana Jones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carl Cortez|title=South Park&amp;nbsp;â Season Twelve&amp;nbsp;â The China Probrem|work=iF Magazine|date=2008-10-09|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=2809|accessdate=2008-10-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] called for the film to be banned, accusing the production team of demonizing the Soviet Union. Party official Andrei Andreyev said: &quot;It is very disturbing if talented directors want to provoke a new Cold War.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7418727.stm |title=Indiana angers Russian communists |accessdate=2008-05-25 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2008-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another party official commented, &quot;(I)n 1957 the USSR was not sending terrorists to America but sending the [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik satellite]] into space!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.russiatoday.ru/entertainment/news/25168 |title=Indiana Jones and the Propaganda Machine |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher=[[Russia Today]] |date=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg responded that he is not unfamiliar with Russia. He explained: &quot;When we decided the fourth installment would take place in 1957, we had no choice but to make the Russians the enemies. [[World War II]] had just ended and the [[Cold War]] had begun. The U.S. didn't have any other enemies at the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://orenburg.kp.ru/daily/24103/329446/ |title= Steven Spielberg: &quot;I'm Russian. But that doesn't explain a thing.&quot; |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher= [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |date=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's depiction of Peru also received criticism from the Peruvian and Spanish-speaking public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/510903.html |title=Califican en PerÃº de ''ofensivos'' errores en ''Indiana Jones'' |accessdate=2008-05-26 |publisher=[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]] |date=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmaffinity.com/es/reviews2/1/301570.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical and Geographical inaccuracies are present throughout the movie - like Nazca being apparently located in Cuzco. 

The mixed fanbase reaction did not surprise Lucas, who was familiar with mixed response to the ''Star Wars'' prequels. &quot;We're all going to get people throwing tomatoes at us,&quot; the series' creator had predicted. &quot;But it's a fun movie to make.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Indiana Jones rides into Cannes | work = [[Reuters]] | date = 2008-05-17 | url = http://uk.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUKELK76198620080517?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 | accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Koepp reflects, &quot;I knew I was going to get hammered from a number of quarters [but] what I liked about the way the movie ended up playing was it was popular with families. I like that families really embraced it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shawn Adler|title=Shia LaBeouf Defends 'Nuking The Fridge' And Other Fantastical 'Indy 4' Moments|work=[[MTV]]|date=2008-09-16|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1594844/story.jhtml|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the infamous &quot;[[nuke the fridge]]&quot; sequence, Spielberg replied, Blame me. Don't blame George. That was my silly idea. People stopped saying 'jump the shark'. They now say, &quot;nuked the fridge&quot;. I'm proud of that. I'm glad I was able to bring that into popular culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=32315&lt;/ref&gt;
