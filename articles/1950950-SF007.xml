'''PC-BSD''' is a [[Unix-like]], desktop-oriented [[operating system]] based on [[FreeBSD]].  It aims to be easy to install by using a graphical installation program, and easy and ready-to-use immediately by providing [[KDE Software Compilation 4|KDE SC]] as the pre-installed [[graphical user interface]]. PC-BSD provides official binary [[nVidia]] and [[Intel]] drivers for hardware acceleration and an optional 3D desktop interface through [[Kwin]]. PC-BSD also contains a [[package management system]] allowing users to graphically install [[Executable|pre-built]] software packages from a single downloaded executable file, which is uncommon on BSD operating systems. In August 2006 it was voted the most beginner friendly operating system by OSWeekly.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2287&amp;Itemid=449|title=The Most Beginner Friendly OS|accessdate=2006-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PC-BSD was originally founded by FreeBSD professional Kris Moore in early 2005.

The first Beta consisted of only a GUI installer to get the user up and running with a FreeBSD 6 system with KDE3 pre-configured. This was a major innovation for the time as anyone wishing to install FreeBSD would have to manually tweak and run through a text installer. Kris Moore's goal was to make FreeBSD easy for everyone to use on the desktop and has since diverged even more in the direction of usability by including additional GUI administration tools and PBI packages (see [[PC-BSD#Package management|Package management]]).

Since October 10, 2006 PC-BSD has been supported by the enterprise-class hardware solution provider [[iXsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ixsystems.com/ix/media/ixsystems-announces-acquisition-of-pc-bsd-operating-system|title=iXsystems Announces Acquisition of PC-BSD Operating System |work=iXsystems.com |accessdate=2011-06-29}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/57794?theme=print |title=Why iXsystems bought PC-BSD |author=Mayank Sharma |date=2006-10-13 |work=linux.com |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; iXsystems now employs Mr. Moore as a full time developer and leader of the project. In November 2007, iXsystems entered into a distribution agreement with [[Fry's Electronics]] whereby Fry's Electronics stores nationwide carry boxed copies of PC-BSD version 1.4 (Da Vinci Edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ixsystems.com/ix/media/ixsystems-announces-distribution-agreement-with-frys-electronics-for-pc-bsd|title=iXsystems Announces Distribution Agreement with Fry's Electronics |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, iXsystems entered into a similar agreement with [[Micro Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ixsystems.com/ix/media/ixsystems-announces-distribution-agreement-with-micro-center-for-pc-bsd|title=iXsystems Announces Distribution Agreement with Micro Center for PC-BSD |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since version 7, PC-BSD began following the same numbering system as [[FreeBSD]]. PC-BSD exclusively uses [[KDE Software Compilation 4|KDE SC]], which has been customized to support tighter application integration and the PBI package management system. While manual installation of other desktops such as [[Xfce]] and [[GNOME]] is technically possible, none of these are supported and major functionality is lost when not using PC-BSD's special build of KDE SC.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcbsdfaq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faqs.pcbsd.org/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=8&amp;id=334&amp;artlang=en |title=Can I use Gnome with PC-BSD? |work=PC-BSD knowledge base |accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;GNOME will be offered, including several other desktop environments, starting with PC-BSD 9.0.

PC-BSD supports [[x86]] and [[x86-64]] architectures.

==Package management==

PC-BSD's [[package management system]] takes a different approach to installing software than many other [[Unix-like]] operating systems. Instead of using the [[FreeBSD ports]] tree directly (although it remains available), PC-BSD uses files with the ''.pbi'' [[filename extension]] which, when double-clicked, bring up an installation [[wizard (software)|wizard]] program. An autobuild system tracks the FreeBSD ports collection and generates new PBIs daily. The generated PBIs are maintained at the [http://www.pbidir.com/ PC-BSD software repository].

All software packages and dependencies are installed in their own self-contained directories in ''/Programs''. This convention is aimed to decrease confusion about where binary programs reside, remove the possibility of a package breaking if system libraries are upgraded or changed, and prevent [[dependency hell]]. The PC-BSD package manager also takes care of creating categorized links in the KDE menu and on the KDE SC desktop.

The PC-BSD package management system aims to be similar to that of major operating systems such as [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Mac OS X]], where applications are installed from a single downloaded file with graphical prompts, rather than the traditional package management systems that many Unix-like systems use.

==License==

PC-BSD was originally licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) because the developers were under the impression that applications using the [[Qt (framework)|Qt]], which PC-BSD uses for its interface development, must be licensed under the GPL or the [[QPL]]. Upon discovering that there was no such restriction in fact, the PC-BSD developers later relicensed the code under a BSD-like license. In March 2009 Qt added an [[LGPL]] License.

==PC-BSD 8.x Requirements==

Minimum system requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.pcbsd.org/index.php/Minimum_Hardware_Requirements|title=Minimum requirement from Users handbook.}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

* [[Pentium II|Intel Pentium II]] or higher
* 512 MB RAM
* 12 GB of free Hard Drive space (Primary partition or entire disk)
* Network card
* Sound card

Recommended system requirements:

* [[Pentium 4|Intel Pentium 4]] or higher&lt;!-- P4 is inefficient!! --&gt;
* 1 GB of RAM
* 20 GB of free Hard Drive space (Primary partition or entire disk)
* Network card
* Sound card
* 3D accelerated video card (NVIDIA, ATI, or Intel)

Though 512 MB RAM is the absolute minimum, one should use at least 1 GB of RAM if possible. To play modern video games, a fast CPU is recommended, and to create a collection of music and videos, a larger hard disk drive is recommended.
