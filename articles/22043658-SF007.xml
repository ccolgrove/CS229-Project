'''Alco Gravure''' was originally the printing division of Crowll Collier, which published ''[[This Week (magazine)|This Week Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,754559,00.html|title=Knapp's Week|date=February 25, 1935|work=TIME Magazine|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime in the 1960s, the magazine folded, and McMillan, Inc. purchased the company, calling it Crowell Collier Macmillan, and later [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Publishing]]. Alco had five plants: [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]; [[Glen Burnie, Maryland|Glen Burnie]], [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]; [[Whitehaven, Memphis|Whitehaven]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]]; [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; and [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]]. Their business was split between two markets, Sunday magazines for major newspapers and mail pieces and newspaper inserts for major retailers. Customers included [[Sears]], [[Walgreens]], [[Montgomery Wards]], [[W.T. Grant]], [[Macy's]], [[The New York Times]], [[Chicago Tribune]], [[Washington Star]], [[Philadelphia Bulletin]] and [[Los Angeles Times]]. It operated as a commercial gravure printer under Macmillan's ownership until 1981.

Unfortunately, Macmillan used the company for its cash flow, and did not fund needed upgrades as technology changed the way the industry operated. There were also high operating costs due to strong union presence. In 1981, Macmillan put the company on the market, and it was purchased by the Alco management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/22/business/briefs-129248.html|title=Briefs|date=May 22, 1981|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They operated the company as an [[Employee ownership|esop]] until 1987, when they sold it to [[Maxwell Communications Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/03/business/company-news-maxwell-to-buy-alco-gravure.html|title=Company News; Maxwell to Buy Alco-Gravure|date=November 3, 1987|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell Communications held ownership until [[Robert Maxwell]]'s death in 1991. Alco was last purchased by World Color, now [[Quebecor]]. The only facility remaining is the Memphis location.

'''Alco's''' antiquated reproduction process used an acid resist etching film made by '''DuPont'''. '''RR Donnelley''' utilized a''' HelioKlischograph''' which produces more predictable results than the acid etch process. '''Alco'''  lost the '''NYT Magazine''' contract to '''Donnelley'''. '''Donnelley's''' workers were non union.
