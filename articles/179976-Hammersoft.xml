==History==
[[File:Murchison 1.jpg|thumb|right|Winspear Auditorium, [[University of North Texas College of Music]] (photo by Craig D. Blackmon, FAIA, courtesy of Holzman Moss Architecture)]]

The university was founded in 1890 by Joshua Crittenden Chilton as the '''Texas Normal College and Teachers' Training Institute''' and was originally housed in leased facilities above a hardware store. In 1893, overworked and facing poor health, Chilton turned the school over to John Jackson Crumley. Renamed '''North Texas Normal College''', the school was once again turned over to Menter B. Terrill in 1894. By 1899 the school had been made a state institution by the Texas Legislature, becoming '''North Texas State Normal College''' under its fourth president, J.S. Kendall. In 1923, after president William H. Bruce's suggestion, the school underwent its fourth name change, becoming '''North Texas State Teachers' College'''. Under president Dr. W. Joseph McConnell, the college grew tremendously; the first master's degrees were awarded in 1936 and the school was given its own Board of Regents in 1949, changing its name once again to '''North Texas State College'''. President Dr. J.C. Matthews' tenure also saw important development. In 1961 the college became '''North Texas State University''', and by 1964 was approved by the Texas Commission on Higher Education to begin several doctoral programs. In 1988, the university changed names one final time, becoming the '''University of North Texas'''.&lt;ref name=Traditions&gt;[http://www.unt.edu/traditions/ University of North Texas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions and symbols===
====Mascot====
UNT's mascot is the [[eagle]] and was adopted in 1922 in a student election over the dragon, the lion, and the cottontail rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;UNT InHouse&quot; (faculty newsletter), December 22, 2005 (retrieved September 17, 2007) [http://inhouse.unt.edu/index.cfm?date=12/2005 Unt.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; This selection is said to have reflected the student population's ideals of individual liberty and freedom of expression, values the UNT community continues to cherish.{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} The costumed eagle character, Scrappy, appears at sporting and university events, though he didn't always go by that name; in 1974, students who felt &quot;Scrappy&quot; was too warlike dubbed the bird &quot;Eppy,&quot; and he kept that name until 1995. Athletic teams are referred to as the &quot;Mean Green.&quot;  This name is usually associated with football star and 1969 graduate [[Joe Greene (American football)|&quot;Mean&quot; Joe Greene]], a legendary member of the famous [[Steel Curtain]] defense of the 1970s [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]; however, accounts vary about the actual origins of &quot;Mean Green.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/archives/w04/mean.htm University of North Texas North Texan Online Fall 2004: Mean Green video memories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2002, the school's chapter of the Albino Squirrel Preservation Society attempted to make the group's namesake the school's secondary mascot. The student body narrowly rejected the measure.&lt;ref&gt;North Texas Daily, April 8, 2003 (retrieved September 17, 2007) [http://media.www.ntdaily.com/media/storage/paper877/news/2003/04/08/UndefinedSection/Students.Express.Opinions.In.Sga.Vote-1887675.shtml NTdaily.com]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation broken|date=June 2011}} In August 2006, the albino squirrel, believed to bring luck to students who spotted him before an exam, was killed by a red-tailed hawk.&lt;ref&gt;North Texas News Service, February 2006 (retrieved September 17, 2007) [http://www.unt.edu/northtexan/archives/f06/untnews.htm Unt.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2007, another albino squirrel had been born on campus.&lt;ref&gt;Albino Squirrel Preservation Society Web site (retrieved September 17, 2007) [http://orgs.unt.edu/asps Unt.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

====UNT Fight Song====
After winning a university sponsored contest, alumnus Francis Stroup wrote the school's fight song in 1939. Throughout the years, the song has changed its lyrics to reflect the name changes of the university.

''Let's give a cheer for U of NT;''&lt;br /&gt;
''Cheer for the Green and White.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Victory's in store whatever the score,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Our team will ever fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!''&lt;br /&gt;
''Shoulder to shoulder we march along,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Striving for victory.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Playing the game for the honor and fame,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And the glory of UNT.''&lt;br /&gt;
''U ... N ... T ... Eagles!''&lt;br /&gt;
''UNT Eagles Fight, Fight, Fight!''&lt;ref name=Enrollment/&gt;

====Alma Mater====
In 1919, [[Julia Smith (composer)|Julia Smith]], member of the university's band (now called the [[Green Brigade Marching Band|Green Brigade]]), composed '''&quot;Glory to the Green and White&quot;''' which was adopted as the school's [[alma mater]] in 1922.

''Singing glory to the green,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Singing glory to the white,''&lt;br /&gt;
''For we know our university is''&lt;br /&gt;
''striving for the right,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Down the corridor of years,''&lt;br /&gt;
''We'll forget the joys and tears,''&lt;br /&gt;
''But North Texas, North Texas,''&lt;br /&gt;
''We love!''''&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;

====Traditions====
[[Image:UNT Eagle statue.jpg|right|thumb|&quot;In High Places&quot; is a prominent representation of the eagle on campus.]]
* The '''Spirit Bell''' is a 2,000-pound bell originally brought in from Michigan in 1891 to signal class changes and curfew. Members of the Talons spirit group later began running it up and down the field at football games; it was retired to the University Union in 1982 after it developed a crack. A 1,600-pound Spirit Bell is currently in use at games.&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;
* '''McConnell Tower''', the clock tower atop the Hurley Administration Building at the center of campus, is bathed in green light for each victory by a UNT athletic team. It appears on the official class ring with two different times on its faces: 1:00 (for the One O'Clock Lab Band) and 7:00 (the 1892 curfew time for Texas Normal College and Teacher Training Institute students).&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;
* The '''eagle talon''' hand gesture is made by curling the thumb, index and middle fingers forward, leaving the ring finger and pinky closed against the palm.&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;
* A bonfire is built with thousands of pallets donated by [[Miller Brewing]] of Denton and the local [[Peterbilt]] plant. The pallets are stacked in a 40-foot by 40-foot footprint then stacked to a final height of 25 feet. It is assembled by members of the Talons spirit group the week before Homecoming and is lit on the Friday night of Homecoming week (when a burn ban is not in effect).&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;
* [http://incipientstage.20megsfree.com/images/boomerlimberfouts1_792x594.jpg'''Boomer the Cannon'''], hand crafted from solid oak on the Denton campus, the 7/8th scale M1841 6 pound, smooth bore muzzleloader cannon has been used to signify scores by the Mean Green since Fall 1970. Since that time &quot;Boomer the Cannon&quot; has gone through three different phases of restoration by Talon alumni. The final was in the Fall of 2007 in which the final phase saw him fitted with a custom Limber to assist with transportation and equipment handling.&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;
* The '''Green Machine''' is a green 1931 Ford Model A Tudor Sedan and is driven by members of the Talons Cannon Crew at home football games and special events. This should not be confused with the ''Mean Green Machine,'' a large mechanical eagle trailed by remote panel in a truck, controlled by three physics students, that made Homecoming and other appearances between 1968 and 1976. The Green Machine is currently undergoing an overhaul by members of Talons Cannon Crew.&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;
* '''&quot;In High Places&quot;''', a 22-foot-tall bronze statue of a flying eagle created by Gerald Balciar, is a popular landmark and meeting place, and is often decorated in green for school spirit. It was dedicated during the university's centennial celebrations in 1990.&lt;ref name=Traditions/&gt;
