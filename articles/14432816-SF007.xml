'''Tux, of Math Command''' (TuxMath, for short) is an [[open source]] [[arcade game|arcade]]-style [[video game]] for learning [[mathematics]], initially created for [[Linux]].  The game-play mechanic is based loosely on that of the arcade game [[Missile Command]], but with [[comets]] falling on cities, rather than [[missiles]]. Like Missile Command, players attempt to protect their cities, but rather than using a [[trackball]]-controlled targeting cross-hair, players solve math problems that label each comet, which causes a [[laser]] to destroy it. Since 1.7.0 the game also include a multiplayer mode and Factor-fraction activity called Factoroids.

Eventually the city imagery was replaced with [[igloos]], to match the [[arctic]] theme of [[Tux]], the Linux penguin, who stars in the game. (The first alpha of the game was released by its initial developer, [[Bill Kendrick]], in September 2001, days prior to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It was decided that the imagery of exploding buildings was no longer suitable.)

==Features==
* Multiple user support (useful for schools)
* On-screen tutorials
* High score table
* Training mode - over 50 bundled lessons ranging from simple number typing up through all four basic arithmetic operations with negative numbers and &quot;missing number&quot; questions (e.g. &quot;3 x ? = 12&quot;).
* Multi-platform support ([[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[BeOS]])
* [[Internationalization and localization|Localization]] to over thirty (human) languages.
* Supports LAN multiplayer mode.
* Missions
* Factoroids: clone of classic Atari video game &quot;Asteroids&quot;, modified to be an activity to train factorization.

==Distribution==
TuxMath is included in numerous Linux [[Linux distribution|distributions]], including the [[Edubuntu]] flavor of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. It is included as a game on the [[ASUS Eee PC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.com/feature/124240 Linux.com review of the ASUS Eee PC], January 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included on the [[Dish Network]] 721 [[Digital Video Recorder|PVR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/bill/news/2002.12.shtml News from Bill Kendrick's personal website], December, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
