Of his casting Makarem commented: &quot;Nikhil is a fiercely ambitious and determined individual, but having lived in the shadow of his brother in the past, he has an indomitable spirit and drive to make the factory a success. He's very quick-witted and extremely protective of his younger sister. I'm really looking forward to filming my first scenes later this month.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt; The show's series producer Gavin Blyth said of the family: &quot;The Sharmas are a young, contemporary family independent of their parents and will bring the factory into the heart of the village community. They will add real vitality to life in ''Emmerdale''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt; Makarem began filming his scenes on 21 July.&lt;ref name=&quot;three&quot;/&gt;

==Character history==
Nikhil and his brother [[Jai Sharma|Jai]] arrived in the village on September 11, 2009, having purchased a new sweet factory. The brothers soon realise they have locked themselves out of their new home and ask the Dingles for help in breaking in. After successfully gaining entry, [[Lisa Dingle]] convinces Jai to give her husband [[Zak Dingle|Zak]] a job in the factory as the driver. Jai agrees. Nikhil reminded his brother that he was the real boss and did not want Jai undermiming him. This has provided a source of tension between the brothers as they opened the factory. As their business venture continued, Nikhil decided to leave the business to his brother, who had been taking control despite Nikhil being the actual owner. He eventually decided to stay however, and promoted his sister Priya to supervisor.

Nikhil started dating [[Maisie Wylde]] in 2010. They were briefly engaged in january 2011 until Maisie admitted she didn't love him, before leaving Emmerdale with her younger brother Will, leaving Nikhil heartbroken.
