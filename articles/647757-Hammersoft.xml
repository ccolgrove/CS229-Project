The '''United States women's national soccer team''' (sometimes referred to as '''USWNT''') represents the United States in international [[association football|soccer]] competition and is controlled by [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]]. The U.S. team won the first ever [[FIFA Women's World Cup|Women's World Cup]] in [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]], and has since been a superpower in women's soccer. It is currently ranked first in the world by the [[FIFA Women's World Rankings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=usa/ranking/gender=f/index.html], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; The team has also won the [[1999 Women's World Cup]], three [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Women's Gold Medals]] (1996, 2004 and 2008) and eight [[Algarve Cup]]s (2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011).

Among its many other honors, the team was selected the U.S. Olympic Committee's Team of the Year in 1997 and 1999. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' chose the entire team as its 1999 [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportspeople of the Year]].

==History==
The team played its first match on August 18, 1985, coached by Mike Ryan (not related to 2005â2007 coach Greg Ryan). In March 2004, two of its stars, [[Mia Hamm]] (who retired later that year after a post-[[2004 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] team tour of the USA) and [[Michelle Akers]] (who had already retired), were the only two women and the only two Americans named to the [[FIFA 100]], a list of the 125 greatest living soccer players chosen by [[PelÃ©]] as part of [[FIFA]]'s centenary observances.

Arguably their most influential and memorable victory came in the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup|1999 World Cup]] when they beat [[China women's national football team|China]] 5â4 in a penalty shootout. With this win they emerged onto the world stage and brought significant media attention to women's soccer and athletics. On July 10, 1999, over 90,000 people (the largest ever for a womenâs sporting event and one of the largest attendances in the world for a tournament game final) filled the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] to watch the United States play China in the Final. After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0â0 at full time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With [[Briana Scurry]]'s save of China's third kick, the score was 4â4 with only [[Brandi Chastain]] left to shoot. She scored and won the game for the United States. Chastain famously dropped to her knees and whipped off her shirt, celebrating in her [[sports bra]], which later made the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' and the front pages of newspapers around the country and world.

Perhaps the second most influential victory came on July 10, 2011, in the quarterfinal of the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup|2011 Women's World Cup]] in Germany, where the US beat [[Brazil women's national soccer team|Brazil]] 5â3 on penalty kicks. [[Abby Wambach]] tied the game 2â2 in the 2nd minute of extra time in the 2nd period of overtime (the 122nd minute of the match overall). Earlier in the game, Brazil had evened the score 1â1 on a controversial penalty kick. Interestingly, the game was played on the 12th anniversary of the memorable 1999 World Cup Final (described above), which the US also won on penalty kicks.

==Kit==
Traditionally since the team started, the kit has been an all white kit. Occasionally blue shorts have been used. As of May 2011, the away kit is all black. Like the [[United States men's national soccer team|men's team]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] is the team's kit manufacturer. The team also wears two [[Star (football crest)|stars]] above the US Soccer crest, to signify their two world championships.
