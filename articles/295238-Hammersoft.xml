==History==
===Origin===
At the conclusion of the [[US Civil War|Civil War]], '''Henry B. Bryant''' and '''Henry D. Stratton''', operators of a chain of business schools decided to open a school in New Jersey. On October 1, 1865, '''The Trenton Business College''' was established in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], located in Temperance Hall at the corner of South Broad and Front Streets. '''Andrew Jackson Rider''' became its first president.&lt;ref name=&quot;philadelphia.about.com&quot;&gt;http://philadelphia.about.com/od/colleges/p/rider_univ.htm&lt;/ref&gt; President Rider was also known as a leading force in the [[cranberry]] industry, as he owned 500 acres of cranberry bogs near [[Hammonton, New Jersey]]. (One of the school colors is cranberry, incidentally.)

President Rider steered the business school through a period of growth, and the school continued to move to larger quarters. In 1896 women were admitted to the school. In 1897, the school was renamed '''The Rider Business College'''. President Rider stepped down the following year. In 1957 Rider introduced liberal studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;philadelphia.about.com&quot;/&gt; The institution officially became known as '''Rider College''' upon its move to East State Street in Trenton in 1921, and the following year the [[New Jersey Board of Education]] granted Rider College permission to confer the degrees of Bachelor of Accounts and Bachelor of Commercial Science. Rider College moved to Lawrenceville in 1964. It affiliated with nearby Princeton [[Westminster Choir College]] in 1991, merged with Westminster in 1992 and became a university in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rider.edu/about&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 2000===
Rider has invested more than $100 million since 2004 to construct new and renovate existing facilities for teaching, performing arts, residences and recreation. In 2005 Rider completed its {{convert|63000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Student Recreation Center (SRC), a new 186-bed residence hall, and three-story additions to Ziegler and Hill Residence Halls, visually symbolizing the renewal taking place on both campuses. It contains locker rooms, a {{convert|3600|sqft|m2|adj=on}} fitness room with cardiovascular and strength training equipment, about 30 workout machines; 10 with built-in TVs, two group-exercise studios, three multi-purpose courts for basketball, tennis; and volleyball, 3-lane elevated track, and game room.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rider.edu/athletics/directions-facilities/student-recreation-center/facilities&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 President Rozanski announced the creation of the School of Fine and Performing Arts to integrate the Lawrenceville and Princeton campuses and expand programming for the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comm.rider.edu/ridernews/html/sections/2006_2007/01_09_22_06/news/01_newsstory.html The Rider News]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years President Rozanski announced new academic programs and new financial aid resources that will help students be able to afford to attend Rider.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[http://www.rider.edu/news/2009/09/04/rozanski-strikes-positive-notes-fall-convocation Rozanski Strikes Positive Notes at Fall Convocation]&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2009, construction was completed on a new, environmentally-friendly 150-bed residence hall on the Lawrenceville campus, and more than 300 new parking spaces. In the summer of 2010 the University began two construction projects, a new, [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED)-silver certified, {{convert|21250|sqft|m2|adj=on}} academic building to be built next to Moore Library, and an {{convert|11000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} expansion of the Bart Luedeke Center Theater, that will include dressing rooms, an orchestra pit, black box theater and a dance studio.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theridernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/100209_optimized.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Both are scheduled to be completed by the Fall 2011 semester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rider University breaks ground&quot;/&gt; As of 2010 fundraising is continuing toward completion of several future facilities priorities including a new performance complex on the Princeton campus, complete with classrooms, rehearsal and performance space, a large reception lobby and a connector to the Playhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Fundraising and planning are also under way to extensively renovate Alumni Gym on the Lawrenceville campus in order to enhance venues for menâs and womenâs basketball, volleyball and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/9548c238#/9548c238/8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
[[File:RiderBroncLogo.png|thumb|right|Athletics logo]]
{{Main|Rider Broncs}}
{{See also|List of college athletic programs in New Jersey, USA#Division I}}
Athletic teams are nicknamed the Broncs. The school competes in the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]].

The intercollegiate sports program at Rider was started by coach [[Clair Bee]] in the 1920s. Two of the school's most famous athletic alumni are former [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] basketball coach and current [[ESPN]] sportscaster [[Digger Phelps]], who played basketball at Rider from 1959 to 1963 and [[Jason Thompson]] who played basketball at Rider from 2004 to 2008 and was drafted by the [[Sacramento Kings]] with the 12th pick of the 2008 NBA Draft while never winning a MAAC championship or appearing in the NCAA Tournament.

The university competed in [[American football|football]] until 1951, when the university was placed under investigation after allegations of paying recruits, as well as improper benefits for players on the team. The NCAA asked the school to discontinue the football program, and the Broncs have not fielded a team since.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Rider students often proclaim their football team &quot;undefeated since 1951,&quot; as they have not existed since that time.

As of January 20, 2007, there are 78 members in the Rider University Athletics [[Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gobroncs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=20200&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=1372269 Rider Athletics Hall of Fame Nominations] (including alphabetical list of inductees).
