The '''Indiana State Sycamores football''' team is the [[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] men's [[American football|football]] program of [[Indiana State University]] in [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], [[Indiana]]. They currently compete in the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]]. The team last played in the NCAA Playoffs in the 1984 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]]. Their first season was 1896.  The Sycamores boast of 8 Conference Player(s) of the Year; 14 First Team All-Americans, and 90+ First Team All-Conference players.  The Sycamore's greatest season was 1983, when coach Dennis Raetz led them to the 2nd round of the 1983 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]] versus the [[Southern Illinois Salukis]] and ended the season with a record of 9&amp;ndash;4. The Sycamores also appeared in 1984 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]].  Past coaches include Dennis Raetz; Jerry Huntsman, George Ashworth and Wally Marks.  The Indiana State Sycamores play their home games at [[Memorial Stadium (Terre Haute)]] (12,764), and are currently coached by [[Trent Miles]].
There have been recent discussions on replacing venerable Memorial Stadium; according to the new ISU Master Plan, a new football-only stadium in downtown Terre Haute, could be realized in the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indstate.edu/news/news.php?newsid=2075&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt; 1949âPresent  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; [[Memorial Stadium (Terre Haute)]], constructed in 1924.
&lt;/table&gt;

The Sycamores have played football at venerable Memorial Stadium since the 1949 campaign.
Originally constructed in 1922-24, at a cost of $450,000; the 12,764-seat stadium remains a fixture at the intersection of Wabash and Brown Avenues in Terre Haute, IN.

Memorial Stadiumâs inauguration was on May 5, 1925, as the local minor league baseball team, the Terre Haute Tots, hosted their [[Three-I League]] rivals, the Peoria Tractors, before an estimated crowd of 9,000.  Among the esteemed visitors were Major League Baseball Commissioner Judge Kennesaw Mountain Landis and Charles Barnard of the Cleveland Indians.

The facility was acquired (via a 99-year lease) by Indiana State University in 1967.  The installation of Astroturf made Indiana State the first university to own a football stadium with artificial turf.

==Rivalries==
===Eastern Illinois===
From 1901 - 2009, the Sycamores played Eastern Illinois 83 times; the series stands at 37-42-4 in favor of Eastern Illinois; the 2009 game was the last for the foreseeable future.  As of 2010, it is unknown when the series will resume as Indiana State's schedules are complete for the next 4 seasons (2013).

===Ball State===
From 1924 - 2003, the Sycamores played Ball State (Ind.) University 62 times; the series stands at 23-38-1 in favor of Ball State (nÃ©e' Indiana State University - Eastern Division).

In 1940, the respective [[Blue Key]] chapters sponsored a trophy presentation, the 'Victory Bell' to reward the winner of the annual game between Indiana State and Ball State.

===Southern Illinois===
The burgeoning rivalry with Southern Illinois has tilted to SIU's advantage in recent seasons, though the overall series record is 23-24 to Southern Illinois' advantage.  The SIU Salukies also own a victory in the only playoff meeting between the schools as SIU bounced Indiana State from the 1983 NCAA Div I-AA playoffs, 23-7.

Following the 1949 season, the Sycamores were invited to the 1949 [[Shrine Bowl]] vs. the SIU Salukies.  The Salukis avenged their earlier 1949 loss to the Sycamores, 41-14.

==Traditions==
===Homecoming===
The term Homecoming was first used in print announcements for the Alumni-Varsity Basketball Game on Dec. 9, 1916. By the year 1919, this event became known as Blue and White Day and featured dances and entertainment for alumni of the Normal School.
In 1921 the events were organized around a football game scheduled earlier in the autumn. A bonfire and pep rally were added to the festivities in 1922; the Blue-and-White Parade in 1923; and in 1937, Bette Whitmore (Kappa Kappa) was elected ISUs first Homecoming Queen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indstate.edu/whyisu/history_trad.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2010 season will mark the 106th season of Sycamore football and the 91st Homecoming; the Sycamores will face conference foe, Illinois State, on October 9.  This will mark the 7th time that Illinois State has been the Homecoming opponent; following a tremoundous victory (59-24) the Sycamores now own a 5-2 mark vs. Illinois State in Homecoming games.

As of 2010; Indiana State owns a 48-36-2 record in Homecoming games; the outcomes of the remaining 5 games are unknown.

===Victory Bell===
Victory Bell- A symbol of the traditional athletic rivalry in football between Indiana State and Ball State. The Victory Bell tradition was inaugurated in 1940 when the Blue Key chapters at both schools arranged to donate a bell to be presented to the victor of the football game. The idea was to start a traditional exchange of the bell as a means of improving relationships between the two student bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indstate.edu/archives/history/essay/traditions.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The Victory Bell series is 17-34 in favor of Ball State.
