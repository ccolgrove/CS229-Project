'''Sacix''' is a [[Debian Pure Blend]] originally created to support the educational and [[free software]] diffusion goals of the [[Telecentre]]s  project of the city of [[SÃ£o Paulo (city)|SÃ£o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. Sacix is now being used in different projects with similar goals, basically because its main feature is an integrated [[Linux Terminal Server Project|LTSP]]-based solution with a profile for each project (login screen, wallpaper, pre-selected software) that provides a ready [[GNOME]] desktop to multiple [[thin clients]], right after install.

The project is currently supported by an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] called RITS with the help of the [[Coletivo Digital]] (&quot;digital collective&quot;), who were part of the original development team in SÃ£o Paulo and volunteer developers.
