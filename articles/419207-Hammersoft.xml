'''''Zwieback''''' is a type of crisp, sweetened [[bread]], made with [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and [[baked]] twice.

It is sliced before it is baked a second time, which produces crisp, [[brittle]] slices that closely resemble [[melba toast]].&lt;ref name=&quot;medilexicon&quot;&gt;[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=100610 Zweiback - Medical Dictionary Definition]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zwieback'' is commonly used to feed [[teething]] children&lt;ref name=medilexicon/&gt;, and as the first solid food for patients with an upset stomach.

The name comes from [[German language|German]] ''zwei'' (&quot;two&quot;) or ''zwie'' (&quot;twi-&quot;), and ''backen'', meaning &quot;to bake&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O39-zwieback.html zwieback - Health Information About zwieback | Encyclopedia.com: Dictionary Of Food and Nutrition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zwieback'' hence literally translates to &quot;twice-baked&quot;.

''Zwieback'' originated in East Prussia, Germany. The [[Mennonite]]s brought ''Zwieback'' to Russia (now Ukraine); during and after the Russian Revolution, they brought ''Zwieback'' to Canada, and other parts of the world.
