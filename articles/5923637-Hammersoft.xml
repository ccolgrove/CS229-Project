#recurring (appearing in two or more episodes).

===Introduced in season one===

*{{anchor|Jack Geller}}{{anchor|Judy Geller}}'''Jack''' and '''Judy Geller''' ([[Elliott Gould]] and [[Christina Pickles]])âRoss and Monica's parents. In early appearances, Jack frequently makes inappropriate comments, which he punctuates by exclaiming &quot;I'm just ''saying''...!&quot; Judy often makes condescending remarks about Monica's lack of a love life and sometimes forgets her daughter even exists, while simultaneously favoring Ross.
:Pickles was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her appearance in &quot;The One Where Nana Dies Twice&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;e&quot; name=&quot;Nana&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title= The One Where Nana Dies Twice|credits= |airdate= September 10, 1994|season= 1|number= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' ranked Jack and Judy jointly as the second best guest character of the series in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;McFadden&quot;/&gt;

*{{anchor|Barry Farber}}'''Barry Farber''' ([[Mitchell Whitfield]])âRachel's jilted fiancÃ©.

He has also been called &quot;Barry White&quot;. Possibly named as an homage to long-time NY talk show host, Barry Farber.

*{{anchors|Carol Willick|Susan Bunch}}'''Carol Willick''' ([[Anita Barone]] for character's debut episode, [[Jane Sibbett]] thereafter) and '''Susan Bunch''' ([[Jessica Hecht]])âRoss' lesbian ex-wife, who came out before the pilot, and her partner.

Susan does not attempt to hide her contempt of Ross and vice versa, but they briefly put aside their differences in &quot;The One with the Birth&quot;&lt;ref group=&quot;e&quot; name=&quot;Birth&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title= The One with the Birth |credits= |airdate= May 11, 1995|season= 1|number= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Carol gives birth to a boy, Ben.

:Carol and Susan were based on Marta Kauffman and David Crane's best friends in New York: &quot;We didn't create them for any particular political reason or because of lesbian chic. It was just an opportunity to tell a really interesting story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stallings (2000), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The characters were called a positive example of a gay couple on television by [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|GLAAD]]. Jessica Hecht originally auditioned to play Monica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=? |first=Bret |last=Watson |newspaper=Entertainment Weekly |date=December 1, 1995 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299751,00.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{anchor|Gunther}}'''Gunther''' ([[James Michael Tyler]])âthe manager of the Central Perk coffee house, who first appears as a background character in &quot;The One with the Thumb&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;e&quot; name=&quot;Thumb&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title= The One with the Thumb|credits= |airdate= October 6, 1994|season= 1|number= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character develops an unrequited crush on Rachel in the third season, which he keeps to himself until &quot;[[The Last One (Friends)|The Last One]]&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;e&quot; name=&quot;Last One&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title= The Last One |credits= |airdate= May 6, 2004|season= 10|number= 17 &amp; 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His jealousy of Ross is made clear numerous times, most notably in &quot;The One the Morning After&quot;,&lt;ref group=&quot;e&quot; name=&quot;Morning After&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title= The One with the Morning After |credits= |airdate= February 20, 1997|season= 3|number= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he reveals to Rachel that Ross cheated on her when they were &quot;on a break&quot;. Gunther appears in nearly every episode, but only occasionally calls attention to himself and almost never has a large role in the plot of an episode. In the Season 8 Episode &quot;The One With The Stain&quot;, Gunther is shown to be fluent in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (although with a hint of an American accent), calling Ross an ''[[donkey|ezel]]'' as he converses with him. (Ross is trying to learn Dutch in order to secure an apartment from a dying Dutch woman.) He also claimed to have played Bryce on ''[[All My Children]]'' and was &quot;killed in an avalanche.&quot;

:James Michael Tyler was cast as Gunther because he was the only extra who could competently work the coffee machine on the Central Perk set. Tyler appears as Gunther in a co-host voice-over in the ''Friends'' trivia game for [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], PC and [[Xbox]], and in the board game ''Friends: Scene It?''. ''The Seattle Times'' ranked Gunther as the eighth best guest character of the series in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;McFadden&quot;/&gt; When asked in 2009 by [[Heat (magazine)|Heatworld.com]] what Gunther would be doing &quot;now&quot;, Tyler joked, &quot;He'd probably have a very traditional marriage, with lots of white-haired babies running around with hair brighter than the sun.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff |date= September 24, 2009|url= http://www.heatworld.com/Article/12312/Friends-/There-was-a-Friends-party-last-night-%E2%80%93-and-it-was-AMAZING|title= There was a Friends party last nightâand it was AMAZING!|publisher=Heatworld.com (Bauer Consumer Media)|accessdate= September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to keep the [[Animal control officer]]{{who|date=November 2011}}âa former classmate of Rachel's and Monica'sâfrom confiscating Marcel, Rachel threatens to tell the woman's boss about how she shot Phoebe &quot;in the ass with a dart&quot; that had been meant for Marcel. Later, as Marcel sexually matures and begins to hump everything, Ross has to give him away to a zoo{{Issue|date=November 2011}}â&quot;where he can have access to regular monkey-lovin'.&quot; Ultimately, Ross finds out that Marcel then got stolen from the zoo and taken into a life of [[show business]], andâafter starring in a liquor commercialâis starring in a movie in New York&lt;ref group=&quot;e&quot; name=&quot;Superbowl&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = The One After the Super Bowl | credits = | airdate = Jaunary 28, 1996 | season = 2 | number = 12 &amp; 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;, where they are reunited one last time.

Tyler told the ''[[St Petersburg Times]]'', &quot;I hope [people's] frustration over [the lack of diversity] is tempered by the fact that when they wrote this role, they didn't wimp out.
