As a child, he trained in ballet and guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills&quot; /&gt; His sister Louise's work in theatre also influenced his decision to become an actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills&quot; /&gt; Bale's father was very supportive of his son's acting, resigning from his job as a commercial pilot to travel and manage Bale's burgeoning career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wills&quot;/&gt; The elder Bale later married feminist icon [[Gloria Steinem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Broughton&quot; /&gt; He died, at age 62, on 30 December 2003 from [[lymphoma|brain lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zielbauer&quot;/&gt;

Bale made his film debut as [[Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia]] in the made-for-television film ''[[Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna]]'' in 1986, which was followed by leading roles in the miniseries ''Heart of the Country'' and the fantasy adventure ''[[Mio in the Land of Faraway]]'', in which he appeared with [[Christopher Lee]] and [[Nick Pickard]].

In 1987, [[Amy Irving]], his co-star in ''Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna'', recommended Bale to her then-husband, [[Steven Spielberg]], for a role in ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', adapted from the [[J.G.

In 1999, Bale played serial killer [[Patrick Bateman]] in ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]'', director [[Mary Harron]]'s adaptation of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' [[American Psycho|controversial novel]]. Bale was briefly dropped from the project in favor of [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], but DiCaprio eventually dropped out to star in ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'', and Bale was cast once again.

''American Psycho'' premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival|2000 Sundance Film Festival]] to much controversy.

On 14 April 2000, [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate Films]] released ''American Psycho'' in theatres. Bale was later approached to make a [[cameo appearance]] in another Bret Easton Ellis adaptation, ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'', a film loosely connected to ''American Psycho'', but he declined out of loyalty to Harron's vision of Bateman, which he felt could not be properly expressed by anyone else.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;&gt;Morris, Clint.

Bale has played an assortment of diverse characters since 2001. His first role after ''American Psycho'' was in the [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] [[Captain Corelli's Mandolin (film)|adaptation]] of the best-selling novel ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]''. Bale played Mandras, a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[fisherman]] who vied with [[Nicolas Cage]]'s title character for the affections of Pelagia ([[Penelope Cruz]]). ''Captain Corelli's Mandolin'' was Bale's second time working with [[John Hurt]], after ''All the Little Animals''.

===2002â2004===
From 2002 to 2003, Bale starred in three feature films. ''[[Laurel Canyon (film)|Laurel Canyon]]'' (2002) was generally well received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laurel Canyon (2003)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/laurel_canyon|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film also marked the second time he worked with actress [[Kate Beckinsale]], his costar in ''Prince of Jutland'' (1994).

''Equilibrium'' featured a fictional [[martial art]] called [[Gun Kata]] that combined [[firearm|gunfighting]] with [[hand-to-hand combat]]. According to moviebodycounts.com, the character of John Preston has the third most on-screen kills in a single movie ever with 118, exactly half of the movie's total of 236.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviebodycounts.com|title=Equilibrium Body Count|accessdate=15 September 2006|publisher= Movie Body Counts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year's hiatus, Bale returned in 2004 to play Trevor Reznik, the title character in the [[psychological thriller]] ''[[The Machinist]]''. Bale gained attention for his devotion to the role and for the lengths to which he went to achieve Reznik's emaciated, skeletal appearance. He went without proper rest for prolonged periods, and placed himself on a [[crash diet]] of generally coffee and apples,&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioFree&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Michael J.|url=http://movies.radiofree.com/interviews/themachi_christian_bale.shtml|title=Interviews Christian Bale, The Machinist|accessdate=5 May 2008|date=4 October 2004|publisher=Radio Free}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reduced his weight by 63 pounds ({{convert|4|st|4|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=s}}) in a matter of months.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/557/557527p1.html|title=IGN Interviews Christian Bale|work=[[IGN]] FilmForce| publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=15 October 2004|accessdate=15 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of filming Bale weighed only 121 pounds ({{convert|8|st|9|lb|kg|abbr=on|disp=s}}),&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioFree&quot;/&gt; a transformation he described as &quot;very calming mentally&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Movieweb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Topel|first=Fred|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEHtLOKJ9zqXLO|title=Christian Bale talks The Machinist|date=15 October 2004|accessdate=5 May 2008|publisher=Movie Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which drew comparisons to [[Robert De Niro]]'s alternate weight-gaining regimen for his role as [[Jake LaMotta]] in the 1980 film ''[[Raging Bull]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/22/movies/22mach.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1129953600&amp;en=26674be522fa7098&amp;ei=5083&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes|title=Insomnia and Then Emaciation; Now Paranoia Takes Its Turn|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=22 October 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale claimed that he had not worked for a period of time before he was cast in the film. &quot;...I just hadn't found scripts that I'd really been interested in.

===Batman: 2005âpresent===
It was reported that Bale had previously auditioned for the role of [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] in ''[[Batman Forever]]'' (1995) and later ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]'' (1997), but lost out to [[Chris O'Donnell]]. However, this rumor was later dispelled by Bale himself in a magazine interview in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;''ShortList'', issue 42, page 28, 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, after completing filming for ''[[The Machinist]]'', Bale won the coveted role of [[Batman]] and his alter ego Bruce Wayne in [[Christopher Nolan]]'s ''[[Batman Begins]]'', a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|Batman film series]].

Still fresh off ''The Machinist'', it became necessary for Bale to bulk up to match Batman's muscular physique. He was given a deadline of six months to do this. Bale recalled it as far from a simple accomplishment: &quot;...when it actually came to building muscle, I was useless. I couldn't do one push up the first day. All of the muscles were gone, so I had a real tough time rebuilding all of that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot; /&gt; With the help of a [[personal trainer]], Bale succeeded in meeting the deadline, gaining a total of {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in six months.

Bale had initial concerns about playing Batman, as he felt more ridiculous than intimidating in the [[Batsuit]]. He dealt with this by depicting Batman as a savage beast.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot; /&gt; To attain a deeper understanding of the character, Bale read various Batman comic books. He explained his interpretation of the young boy: &quot;Batman is his hidden, [[demon]]ic rage-filled side. The creature Batman creates is an absolutely sincere creature and one that he has to control but does so in a very haphazard way. He's capable of enacting violence&amp;nbsp;â and to kill&amp;nbsp;â so he's constantly having to rein himself in.&quot; For Bale, the most gruelling part about playing Batman was the suit. &quot;You stick it on, you get hot, you sweat and you get a headache in the mask,&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm not going to bitch about it because I get to play Batman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Angela.

It has been confirmed that Bale will star in the third projected movie in the rebooted franchise, ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', which will be released on 20 July 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ray Subers|title='Batman' Returns July&amp;nbsp;20,&amp;nbsp;2012|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=30 April 2010|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=2747&amp;p=.htm|accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Bale the actor who has played Batman more times than any other actor in feature film. Bale has given the same opinion as Nolan that, if the latter was forced to bring Robin into the films, he would never again play Batman; even though one of his favorite Batman stories, ''[[Batman: Dark Victory]]'', focuses on Robin's origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://batman.ugo.com/movies/batman_begins/bale.asp|title=UGO's World of Batman â Christian Bale interview for Batman Begins|publisher=[[UGO Networks]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Batman Begins'', Bale returned to appearing in independent films. He was cast as one of the two leads in the [[South Los Angeles|South Central]] [[David Ayer]]-helmed crime drama ''[[Harsh Times]]'', co-starring with [[Freddy Rodriguez]] and [[Eva Longoria]]. Bale played Jim Luther Davis, a grim [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|Afghanistan War]] veteran afflicted with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], approached by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and hired as a federal agent. ''Harsh Times'' premiered at the 2005 [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and had a wide release on 10 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-07-26-blanchett-toronto_x.htm|title=Blanchett joins Toronto festival lineup|date=26 July 2005|work=[[USA Today]]|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terrence Malick]] directed ''[[The New World (film)|The New World]]'', a [[period piece]] inspired by the stories of [[Pocahontas]], and Bale was cast as [[John Rolfe]]. He shared the screen with [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Q'Orianka Kilcher]], who played John Smith and Pocahontas. The majority of screen time was devoted to Farrell and Kilcher; Bale was a secondary character, and only appeared during the last third of the film. The film was a failure at the U.S. box office and its worldwide total (US$29,506,437) fell short of turning a profit (the production budget was placed at US$30 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New World at Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=newworld.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Bale took on four projects. ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'', by German filmmaker [[Werner Herzog]], had him playing U.S. [[Fighter aircraft|Fighter]] pilot [[Dieter Dengler]], who has to fight for his life after being shot down while on a mission during the [[Vietnam War]]. Bale left a strong impression on Herzog, with the director complimenting his acting abilities: &quot;I find him one of the greatest talents of his generation. We made up our own minds long before he did ''[[Batman (film series)|Batman]]''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/movies/movie-news/Christian+Bale-15606.html &quot;Herzog Hails Bale&quot;] ''Female First'', 24 March 2006, retrieved on 17 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast of ''The Prestige'' also included [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Piper Perabo]], and [[David Bowie]]. ''[[I'm Not There]]'', a film in which Bale again worked alongside Todd Haynes and [[Heath Ledger]] (who would go on to play [[Joker (comics)|The Joker]] in ''The Dark Knight''), is an artistic reflection of the life of [[Bob Dylan]]. He starred opposite  [[Russell Crowe]] in a commercially and critically successful Western film, ''[[3:10 to Yuma (2007 film)|3:10 to Yuma]]''.
