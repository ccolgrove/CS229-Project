'''Count Lippe''' is a [[fictional character]] and henchman in the [[James Bond]] novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.  He also appears in the 1965 film of the same name and the 1983 [[remake]], ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.  In ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', he is played by [[Guy Doleman]]; and in ''Never Say Never Again'' by [[Pat Roach]].

The Counts of [[Lippe]] really existed and have descendants still living today.  However, since [[1806]] all members of the family have had the title of Prince, not Count.  The name is probably a reference to [[Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands]] (originally a Prince of Lippe-Biesterfeld) who was a friend of Ian Fleming.  The Prince said to friends the name 'Lippe' in the original novel was a practical joke on the part of Fleming. This joke would be lost on most Germans though; in the German-dubbed movie version, on the other hand, James Bond has an additional line referencing [[Detmold]], the capital of the former principality.&lt;!-- easy to verify; script of English version is online, German dub discussed in several formus --&gt;

===Film===
====''[[Never Say Never Again]]''====

Unlike the previous version of Lippe in ''Thunderball'', in ''Never Say Never Again'' there is no mention of him being a count.  Also he is not directly involved in SPECTRE's plot to have Jack Petachi (this film's version of FranÃ§ois Derval/Angelo Palazzi) steal [[NATO]] [[nuclear warheads]].  Instead, he is merely an [[assassination|assassin]] sent by [[List of characters in Never Say Never Again#Fatima Blush|Fatima Blush]] to kill Bond at the clinic.  He and Bond have a brutal fight that destroys the clinic, and Lippe is ultimately killed after Bond throws a [[beaker]] filled with a [[urine]] [[specimen]] into the killer's face, causing the attacker to scream in disgust and suffer temporary loss of vision. The resulting disorientation causes Lippe to trip and fall on broken beakers, which then is acute enough to cause him to bleed to death.

}}
'''Angelo Palazzi''', played by Greek actor [http://www.autographica.co.uk Paul Stassino], is an agent of SPECTRE.  Palazzi goes through two years studying [[NATO]] pilot FranÃ§ois Derval, taking flying lessons and finally going through [[plastic surgery]] in order to impersonate Derval, so he can hijack an [[Avro Vulcan]] jet and its atomic bombs.  Palazzi's first appearance is in a health clinic, covered in bandages due to the surgery.  After Bond spies in his room, his contractor Count Lippe tries to kill Bond in a spinal traction machine.  Then Palazzi comes to Derval's home with SPECTRE agents while the latter is making love to Fiona Volpe, fatally gasses Derval and takes his documents and [[dog tag (identifier)|dogtag]], and before leaving demands a higher fee of $250,000 for his mission, which his cohorts  appear to reluctantly agree to.

In the air, Palazzi gasses the crew, allowing him to take control of the plane and sink it in a designated location with underwater landing lights near the [[Bahamas]].  However, when he tries to get out of his seat, he is unable to release his restraining harness.  Emilio Largo comes with his men as Palazzi signals for help with his harness, but Largo cuts the air hose of Palazzi's [[oxygen mask]] instead.  Palazzi is left to drown in the cockpit while Largo and his men take the bombs away.

Later, Bond discovers the sunken airplane and takes Derval's dogtag and watch from Palazzi in order to get some help from Derval's sister, [[Domino Vitali|Dominique]].

===Novel===
In the novel, the V bomber is hijacked by Domino's brother Giuseppe Petacchi.  He is an Italian Air Force pilot, hired by Lippe at [[MoD Boscombe Down|Boscombe Down Airfield]].  Petacchi goes into the V bomber acting as a NATO observer of [[Royal Air Force]] procedure.  After killing the crew, he successfully flies the bomber to the Bahamas.  After successfully ditching the aircraft, Petacchi walks out on the wing to meet Vargas, a SPECTRE operative. Instead of congratulating him, Vargas quickly kills him with one thrust from a [[stiletto]] and dumps the body into the sea.  (In the movie version, the part of a henchman being eaten by sharks was taken over by Quist [see below].)

===''Never Say Never Again''===
The plane hijacker in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' is again Domino's brother, '''Jack Petachi''' ([[Gavan O'Herlihy]]).  Petachi has undergone an operation to alter one of his [[retina]]s to match the retinal pattern of the American President.  Using his position as a pilot and the president's eye pattern to [[retina scan|circumvent security]], Petachi infiltrates an American military base in England and orders the dummy warheads in two cruise missiles replaced with two live nuclear warheads, which SPECTRE captures and uses to extort billions of dollars from the governments of the world.  He is then killed by [[List of characters in Never Say Never Again#Fatima Blush|Fatima Blush]].

'''Vargas''' is a [[villain]] and [[assassination|assassin]] in the [[1965]] [[James Bond]] film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.  He is an assassin of [[SPECTRE]] and a personal henchman of [[Emilio Largo]].  The character is portrayed by [[Philip Locke]].

According to Largo, Vargas does not [[drinking|drink]], [[tobacco smoking|smoke]], or [[sexual intercourse|make love]]; abstinence which emphasizes his devotion as a killer.  Those characteristics were used by Ian Fleming to describe the whole Disco Volante crew, but the filmmakers reduced to only one character because it would be &quot;many men doing nothing&quot;.  He is later properly introduced to 007 by Largo while visiting the latter's estate, Palmyra. (Bond had previously met Vargas at a casino while gambling with Largo the other night). A few days later he kidnaps Bond's ally Paula Caplan at their [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] hotel with fellow henchman Janni's help.   

He is killed by James Bond on a [[beach]] with a [[speargun]] in the chest after trying to kill Bond and [[Domino Vitali|Dominique Derval]] while lurking in the [[palm tree]]s, with Bond coolly remarking &quot;I think he got the point&quot;.

Boitier was a SPECTRE agent (SPECTRE #6) and a French colonel featured at the beginning of the film, where his funeral is taking place. Bond says that Boitier murdered two of his colleagues. It is revealed that the operative faked his death and dressed up as his own widow at the funeral.  Bond surprises him at his French chateau, where a fight ensues and Bond kills him by breaking his neck with a fire poker.  

During the bogus funeral, one of the French liaison remarks that Boitier and Bond both share the same initials, possibly an in-joke reference to Simmons portraying as Bond in the previous [[Gun barrel sequence (James Bond)|gun barrel sequences]].

In the film adaptation, the character was renamed '''Jacques Bouvar'''.

He appears at the SPECTRE meeting early in the film, at the point in which Blofeld requests financial information from each of the operatives. Upon requesting SPECTRE #11's report, #11 relays information about money he and #9 have brought into the organization. Blofeld questions #11 about the fact that the amount he described was less than the amount he brought in. #11 denies any knowledge of this, but Blofeld already knows the truth: One of them has been [[embezzlement|embezzling]] money from SPECTRE, which he reveals to #11. Fear grips #11, who thinks his death is imminent, and #9 gives a quick glance, aware that he is the culprit and believing that #11 has taken the fall. However, Blofeld proceeds to use his trademark method of intimidation: after consulting #11 skeptically, he uses his control panel to send an electric current through #9's chair, thus killing the real culprit. The Chair disappears with #9's body and then comes back up again. His death horrifies the other agents while Largo looks at it rather indifferently. {This scene was parodied in [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] Movie}

Fear grips #11, who thinks his death is imminent. Blofeld proceeds to question #11 about his oversight on the operation smuggling [[heroin]] into [[Red China]], demanding to know why the profit margin is so low. A nervous #11 explains that Latin American drug cartels have been tough competition for SPECTRE's heroin business, but Blofeld states he factored that into the operation. When Blofeld says #11 has one last chance to be honest about the reports, #11's last statement is &quot;To the penny, #1.&quot; Blofeld proceeds to use his trademark method of intimidation: after consulting #11 skeptically, he uses his control panel to send an electric current through #9's chair, thus killing the real culprit, which horrifies #11 as a warning for #11 to never deceive Blofeld. #11 is not seen after this, although it is presumed he is still working for SPECTRE.
