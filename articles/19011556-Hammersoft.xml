I actually regard the system as distressing: I am offended by some of the things said in the Bible and the Koran, and I refute them.&quot; She knows she's being controversial, but she believes passionately in what she says, and passionately believes it needs saying. &quot;I think that the Bible as a system of moral guidance in the 21st century is insufficient, to put it mildly,'' she continues, frowning a little. I feel quite strongly that we need a new moral lodestone if we can't rely on what is inside our own selves. Which I think, actually, is pretty reliable.&quot; &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Cornwell interviewing Thompson, '[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,,24497883-15803,00.html Acting on outspoken beliefs]', ''The Australian'', 15 October 2008, Features, Pg. 19 (accessed 11 February 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

|{{sortname|Frank J.|Tipler|Frank J. Tipler}}
|1947&amp;ndash;
|Scientist
|American mathematical physicist and professor at [[Tulane University]].
|Although an atheist, Tipler believes 'God' will eventually exist in the last moments of the universe: 
&quot;The theory is basically this: just as the Earth began with a Big Bang, so it will end, in a single point, which Tipler calls the Omega Point. And just as life on Earth began with a single cell which colonised the planet, so life at the end of time will, according to Tipler, &quot;become omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient which are the three attributes of God&quot;. The Omega Point/God is the point of ultimate, infinite knowledge when the earth will be inhabited by beings who are, to all intents and purposes, computers. Tipler says they can be called beings because he defines life as information processing, as did the famous biologist Richard Dawkins, who called computers &quot;biological objects&quot;. [...] &lt;br /&gt;
Tipler says his own viewpoint is that of an atheist. Though brought up a Christian fundamentalist, he rejected religion when he was 16, because the Church claimed the Earth was 6,000 years old, when he knew that it went back 4.6 billion years. [...] &lt;br /&gt;
Still, it seems excessively generous for the beings of the future to want to resurrect all of us. Tipler answers that they will be extremely intelligent beings, and therefore extremely curious, interested in all the variations that preceded them, from the very beginning, just as today's scientists are working to recreate the first single cell, in all its possible forms. &quot;I think the evidence is very strong that this particular version of you and this particular version of me will actually be there in the future. It will be you and me emulated down to the atom.&quot; Why, he says, we might even end up repeating the whole interview.&quot; Megan Tressider, 'The Megan Tressider Interview: Meaning of life is, er, God and Omega; Physicist Frank J Tipler, an atheist, says he has found God',&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' (London), 18 March 1995, Features Pages, Pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

|17??&amp;ndash;1788?
|Scientist
|British (English) chemist, surgeon, teacher and radical theologian, author of the first published work of avowed atheism in Britain (1782).
|&quot;In religion he was raised as a theist, but in 1782, in an Answer to Dr. Priestley, on the Existence of God, a response to Priestley's Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever, he described himself as a freethinker (p.&amp;nbsp;5). This work, first published under the pseudonym William Hammon, was subsequently republished by Richard Carlile in 1826. In the pamphlet Turner declared that he was an atheist, though he did admit that the 'vis naturae', gravity, and matter's elasticity and repulsive powers demonstrated that the universe was permeated by 'a principle of intelligence and design' (ibid., 17). Despite the 'perpetual industry' of nature, he denied that this intelligence entailed that philosophers needed to posit the existence of a deity extraneous to the material world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;E.

|&quot;Creation myths tap into the same kind of issues as post-human SF, albeit sometimes turned upside-down: &quot;Where are we going?&quot; instead of &quot;Where did we come from?&quot;  &quot;What does it mean to be human or to play god?&quot;  I find these kind of questions perpetually interesting, so will probably keep coming back to them forever.  The solo space opera books are certainly tapping into the same vein, perhaps more overtly than ever.  This is what comes of being an atheist, perhaps: we think about these things more than most people.  Obsess about them, probably.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sffworld.com/interview/211p0.html Interview with Sean Williams], SFFWorld.com, 19 November 2006 (accessed 9 March 2009)).&lt;/ref&gt;

|&quot;When I heard on the phone that Yehuda had died, there was never a moment of disbelief. I knew what kind of universe I lived in. How is my religious family to comprehend it, working, as they must, from the assumption that Yehuda was murdered by a benevolent God? The same loving God, I presume, who arranges for millions of children to grow up illiterate and starving; the same kindly tribal father-figure who arranged the Holocaust and the Inquisition's torture of witches. I would not hesitate to call it evil, if any sentient mind had committed such an act, permitted such a thing. But I have weighed the evidence as best I can, and I do not believe the universe to be evil, a reply which in these days is called atheism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yudkowsky.net/yehuda.html My little brother, Yehuda Nattan Yudkowsky, is dead.]&lt;/ref&gt;

|&quot;God brought ''evil-doing'' into the world when he devised animals that feed on other animals. The horrific pain that living beings inflict upon other living beings is part of a world created by a âgoodâ God? Good God! Observations made at the level of the informational macromolecules and their interactions do not suggest that living systems have been built up thanks to the insights and decisions of a master engineer. Why would God tinker? Doesnât He know in advance the biological pathways that work? Isnât a tinkering God one who loudly says âI am notâ? And why would He say so if He existed? [...] A direct implication of intelligent design, is that it could only have been carried out by a God. A standard response ... when hard-pressed, they proclaim that it is all a mystery. Existence already was a mystery, before people of faith further deepened it, and solving a mystery with a mystery is no solution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://72.14.235.104/search?q=cache:kz-hjwHMGLEJ:www.idnet.com.au/files/pdf/zuckerkandl%2520on%2520ID.pdf+%22Emile+Zuckerkandl%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=au Intelligent design and biological complexity.]&lt;/ref&gt;
