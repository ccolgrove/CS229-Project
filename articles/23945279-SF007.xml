'''Blu-ray Disc''' (official abbreviation '''BD''') is an [[optical disc]] [[data storage device|storage]] medium designed to supersede the [[DVD]] format. The plastic disc is 120&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick, the same size as [[DVD]]s and [[CD]]s. Blu-ray Discs contain 25 [[gigabyte|GB]] (23.31 [[gibibyte|GiB]]) per layer, with dual layer discs (50 GB) being the norm for feature-length video discs. Triple layer discs (100 GB) and quadruple layers (128 GB) are available for BD-XL Blu-ray re-writer drives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2011/02/23/pioneer-bdxl-bdr-206-review/1&lt;/ref&gt; Currently movie production companies have not utilized the triple or quadruple layer discs; most consumer owned Blu-ray players will not be able to read the additional layers, while newer Blu-ray players may require a [[firmware]] update to play the triple and quadruple sized discs.

The first Blu-ray Disc prototypes were unveiled in October 2000, and the first prototype player was released in April 2003 in [[Japan]]. Afterwards, it continued to be developed until its official release in June 2006.

The name ''Blu-ray Disc'' refers to the [[blue laser]] used to read the disc, which allows information to be stored at a greater density than is possible with the longer-wavelength red laser used for [[DVD]]s.

Blu-ray Disc was developed by the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]], a group representing makers of consumer electronics, computer hardware, and motion pictures. {{As of|June 2011}}, more than 2,500 Blu-ray Disc titles were available in Australia and the United Kingdom, with 3,500 in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/movies.php?show=nowavailable |title=Now Available |publisher=Blu-ray.com |accessdate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, {{as of|July 2010|lc=on}}, more than 3,300 titles have been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/av/docs/bdhdship/|title=Blu-ray/HD DVD releases in Japan|publisher=AVWatch|accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[high definition optical disc format war]], Blu-ray Disc competed with the [[HD DVD]] format. [[Toshiba]], the main company that supported HD DVD, conceded in February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |url=http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm |title=Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses |publisher=Toshiba |date=February 19, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; releasing their own Blu-ray Disc player in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Yomiuri Shimbun page 1, 19 July 2009 Ver. 13S&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Blu-ray disc (BD-RE).JPG|right|thumb|200px|A blank rewritable Blu-ray Disc ([[BD-RE]]).]]

===Origins===
The information density of the [[DVD]] format was limited by the wavelength of the [[laser diodes]] used.  Following protracted development, [[blue laser|blue]] laser diodes operating around 400 [[nanometers]] became available on a production basis.
[[Sony]] started two projects in collaboration with [[Philips]] &lt;ref&gt;''[http://inlatest.com/20101102199/bluray-emmy/ Panasonic, Sony, Philips And TDK Awarded Emmy For Blu-Ray Contribution] &lt;/ref&gt; applying the new diodes: [[Ultra Density Optical|UDO]] (Ultra Density Optical),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press_Archive/200011/00-54E1/ |title=Sony Develops Next Generation Optical Disk Storage System For the Data Server Market |date=November 1, 2000 |work=[[Sony|Sony.net]] |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and DVR Blue (together with [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/31062/new_highcapacity_dvd_to_hold_225gb.html |title=New High-Capacity DVD to Hold 22.5GB |date=October 5, 2000 |last=Williams |first=Martyn |work=[[Pcworld.com]] |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a format of rewritable discs that would eventually become Blu-ray Disc (more specifically, BD-RE). The core technologies of the formats are similar.

The first DVR Blue prototypes were unveiled at the [[CEATEC]] exhibition in October 2000 by [[Sony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The first consumer device arrived in stores on April 10, 2003: the [[Sony BDZ-S77]], a $3,800(US) BD-RE recorder that was made available only in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digit-life.com/articles2/blu-ray/ |title=SONY BDZ-S77 Recorder Review |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Maxim Liadov |date= |work=digit-life.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; But there was no standard for prerecorded video, and no movies were released for this player.

Hollywood studios insisted that players be equipped with [[Digital Rights Management]] before they would release movies for the new format, and they wanted a new DRM system that would be more secure than the failed [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS) used on DVDs.

On October 4, 2004, the name &quot;Blu-ray Disc Founders&quot; was officially changed to the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]] (BDA), and [[20th Century Fox]] joined the BDA's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/041004foxbluray |title=Fox trots towards Blu-ray |accessdate=2009-03-16 |date=2002-10-04 |publisher=ITWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blu-ray Disc physical specifications were completed in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The BD-ROM specifications were finalized in early 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, the final AACS standard was delayed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,123924-page,1/article.html |title=Toshiba Hints at HD DVD Delay |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Martyn Williams |date=2005-12-14 |work=pcworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then delayed again when an important member of the Blu-ray Disc group voiced concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/69559 |title=AACS copy protection for Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD delayed again |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Craig Morris |date=2006-02-14 |work=heise.de |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the initial hardware manufacturers, including Toshiba, Pioneer, and Samsung, an interim standard was published that did not include some features, such as managed copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,124961-page,1/article.html |title=Burning Questions: No Copying From First High-Def Players |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Melissa J.

===Competition from HD DVD===
{{Main|High definition optical disc format war}}

The [[DVD Forum]], chaired by [[Toshiba]], was split over whether to develop the more expensive blue laser technology. In March 2002, the forum approved a proposal endorsed by [[Warner Bros.]] and other [[film studio|motion picture studios]] that involved compressing HD content onto dual-layer standard [[DVD-9]] discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20020301S0091 |title=Picture's fuzzy for DVD |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Junko Yoshida |date=2002-03-01 |work=eetimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20011212S0060 |title=Forum to weigh Microsoft's Corona as DVD encoder |accessdate=2007-10-19 |author=Junko Yoshida |date=2001-12-12 |work=eetimes.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this decision, however, the DVD Forum's Steering Committee announced in April that it was pursuing its own blue-laser [[high-definition video]] solution. In August, Toshiba and NEC announced their competing standard, Advanced Optical Disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,104570-page,1/article.html |title=Toshiba, NEC Share Details of Blue-Laser Storage |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author= |date=2002-08-29 |work=pcworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally adopted by the DVD Forum and renamed [[HD DVD]] the next year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2003/11/28/dvd-forum-backs-toshiba-nec-format |title=DVD Forum backs Toshiba-NEC format |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author= |date=2003-11-28 |work=theinquirer.net |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being voted down twice by DVD Forum members who were also Blu-ray Disc Association membersâa situation that drew preliminary investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6458096.html|title=Opinion: Trust's worth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA6258560.html?q=DVD+Forum+Blu%2Dray|title=Lieberfarb lobs charges at Blu-ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HD DVD had a head start in the high-definition video market, as Blu-ray Disc sales were slow to gain market share. The first Blu-ray Disc player was perceived as expensive and buggy, and there were few titles available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/video-players-and-recorders/samsung-bd-p1000/4505-6463_7-31799185.html#more |title=Samsung BD-P1000 Review |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author=David Katzmaier |date=2006-06-30 |work=cnet.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearance of the Sony [[PlayStation 3]], which contained a Blu-ray Disc player for primary storage, helped turn the tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2008/02/23/dlclaud123.xml|title=Blu-ray Wins&amp;nbsp;â Telegraph|date=2008-02-23|publisher=Telegraph (UK)|accessdate=2008-02-23 | location=London | first=Claudine | last=Beaumont}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony also ran a more thorough and influential marketing campaign for the format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7252506.stm |title=How the PS3 led Blu-ray's triumph |publisher=BBC News |author=Will Smale |date=February 19, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2006 also saw the launch of [[AVCHD]] camcorders, whose recordings can be played back on many Blu-ray Disc players without re-encoding, but not on HD DVD players.

By January 2007, Blu-ray Discs had outsold HD DVDs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homemediamagazine.com/news/html/breaking_article.cfm?article_id=10323 |title=Blu-ray Tips Scales |accessdate=2007-10-18 |author=Stephanie Prange |date=2007-02-23 |work=homemediamagazine.com |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the first three quarters of 2007, BD outsold HD DVDs by about two to one. At [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES 2007]], Warner proposed [[Total Hi Def]]âa hybrid disc containing Blu-ray on one side and HD DVD on the other, but it was never released.

In a June 28, 2007 press release, Twentieth Century Fox cited Blu-ray Disc's adoption of the BD+ anticopying system as key to their decision to support the Blu-ray Disc format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdplusllc.com/news |title=BD+ Technologies Launches Content Protection Licensing Program |publisher=BD+ Technologies, LLC |date=2007-06-28 |accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/02/how-crypto-won.html |title=How Crypto Won the DVD War |publisher=Wired |author=Ryan Singel |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2008, a day before [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2008, [[Warner Bros.]] (the only major studio still releasing movies in both HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc format) announced that it would release only in Blu-ray Disc after May 2008. This effectively included other studios that came under the Warner umbrella, such as [[New Line Cinema]] and [[HBO]]âthough in Europe, [[HBO]] distribution partner, the [[BBC]], announced it would, while keeping an eye on market forces, continue to release product on both formats. This led to a chain reaction in the industry, with major U.S. retailers such as [[Best Buy]], [[Wal-Mart]], and [[Circuit City (1949â2009 company)|Circuit City]] and Canadian chains such as [[Future Shop]] dropping HD DVD in their stores. A then major European retailer, [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]], dropped HD DVD from its inventory.&lt;ref name=woolsworth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2008/01/consumers-analysts-retailers-give-hd-dvd-the-cold-shoulder.ars |title=Consumers, analysts, retailers give HD DVD the cold shoulder | author=Eric Bangeman |publisher=Ars Technica |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netflix]] and [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]]âmajor [[DVD rental]] companiesâsaid they would no longer carry HD DVDs. 

Following these new developments, on February 19, 2008, Toshiba announced it would end production of HD DVD devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7252172.stm |title=Toshiba drops out of the HD DVD war |accessdate=2008-02-19 |publisher=BBC News |date=February 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing Blu-ray Disc to become the industry standard for high-density optical discs. [[Universal Studios]], the sole major movie studio to back HD DVD since its inception, said shortly after Toshiba's announcement, &quot;While Universal values the close partnership we have shared with Toshiba, it is time to turn our focus to releasing new and catalog titles on Blu-ray Disc.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-bluray20feb20,0,5286548.story?page=2 |title=Blu-ray winner by KO in high-definition war |accessdate=2008-02-22 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=2008-02-20 | first1=Dawn C. | last1=Chmielewski | first2=Bruce | last2=Wallace |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080324113847/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-bluray20feb20,0,5286548.story?page=2 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramount Studios, which started releasing movies only in [[HD DVD]] format during late 2007, also said it would start releasing in Blu-ray Disc. Both studios announced initial Blu-ray lineups in May 2008. With this, all major Hollywood studios supported Blu-ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN2118265320080221 |title=All Hollywood studios now lined up behind Blu-Ray |publisher= Reuters (The Hollywood Reporter)|accessdate=2008-02-21 | date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blu-ray Disc began making serious strides as soon as the format war ended. Nielsen VideoScan sales numbers showed that with some titles, such as 20th Century Fox's ''Hitman'', up to 14% of total disc sales were from Blu-ray, although the average for the first half of the year was around 5%. Shortly after the format war ended, a study by The NPD Group found that awareness of Blu-ray Disc had reached 60% of U.S. households. In December 2008, the Blu-ray Disc of ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' sold 600,000 copies on the first day of its launch in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarkKnightDay&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/High-Def_Disc_Sales/Warner/Disc_Sales:_Dark_Knight_Tops_600K_On_Release_Day/2324 |title=Disc Sales: 'Dark Knight' Tops 600K On Release Day |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after launch, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' BD had sold over 1.7 million copies worldwide, making it the first Blu-ray Disc title to sell over a million copies in the first week of release.&lt;ref name=&quot;DarkKnightWeek&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Warner/Disc_Sales/Disc_Sales:_Dark_Knight_Blu-ray_Breaks_1M_First-Week_Barrier/2341 |title=Disc Sales: 'Dark Knight' Blu-ray Breaks 1M First-Week Barrier |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=2008-12-17 |accessdate=2009-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Singulus Technologies]] AG, Blu-ray is being adopted faster than the DVD format was at a similar period in its development. This conclusion was based on the fact that Singulus Technologies has received orders for 21 Blu-ray dual-layer machines during the first quarter of 2008, while 17 DVD machines of this type were made in the same period in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.infoniac.com/hi-tech/blu-ray-is-being-adopted-much-faster-than-dvd.html |title=Blu-ray is Being Adopted Much Faster Than DVD 11 Years Ago |publisher=InfoNIAC.com |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GfK Retail and Technology, in the first week of November 2008, sales of Blu-ray recorders surpassed DVD recorders in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/multimedia/display/20081210121641_Sales_of_Blu_Ray_Disc_Recorders_Leave_Behind_Sales_of_DVD_Recorders_in_Japan.html |title=Sales of Blu-ray Disc Recorders Leave Behind Sales of DVD Recorders in Japan |work=xbitlabs.com |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |last=Shilov |first=Anton}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Digital Entertainment Group, the total number of Blu-ray Disc playback devices (both set-top box and game console) sold in the U.S. had reached 28.5 millions by the end of 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;2010sales&quot;/&gt;.

===Laser and optics===
While a DVD uses a 650&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] red laser, Blu-ray Disc uses a 405&amp;nbsp;nm &quot;[[blue laser|blue]]&quot; [[laser diode]]. Note that even though the laser is called &quot;blue&quot;, its color is actually in the [[Violet (color)|violet]] range. The smaller beam focuses more precisely, thus enabling it to read information recorded in pits that are less than half the size of those on a DVD, and can consequently be spaced more closely, resulting in a shorter track pitch, enabling a Blu-ray Disc to hold about five times the amount of information that can be stored on a DVD. 

The lasers are [[gallium nitride|GaN]] (gallium nitride) laser diodes that produce 405&amp;nbsp;nm light directly, that is, without [[frequency doubling]] or other [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear optical]] mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sony.net/Products/SC-HP/laserdiodewld/tec/index03.html 3. Laser Diodes for Blu-ray Discs], Sony, says Blu-ray Disc laser diodes use GaN&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional [[DVD]]s use 650&amp;nbsp;nm red lasers, and [[Compact Disc|CD]]s use 780&amp;nbsp;nm near-infrared lasers.

[[File:Panasonic BD-CMBUJ120.jpg|right|thumb|Panasonic Internal Blu-ray ROM notebook drive]]

The minimum &quot;[[spatial resolution|spot size]]&quot; on which a laser can be focused is limited by [[diffraction]], and depends on the wavelength of the light and the [[Numerical aperture (microscopy)|numerical aperture]] of the [[lens (optics)|lens]] used to focus it. By decreasing the wavelength, increasing the numerical aperture from 0.60 to 0.85, and making the cover layer thinner to avoid unwanted optical effects, the laser beam can be focused to a smaller spot, which effectively allows more information to be stored in the same area.&lt;ref name=&quot;BDF physical format whitepaper&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In addition to the optical improvements, Blu-ray Discs feature improvements in data encoding that further increase the amount of content that can be stored.&lt;ref name=&quot;encoding&quot;&gt;{{Cite thesis

===Hard-coating technology===
Since the Blu-ray Disc data layer is closer to the surface of the disc compared to the [[DVD]] standard, it was at first more vulnerable to scratches.&lt;ref name=&quot;BDF general whitepaper&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/general_bluraydiscformat-15263.pdf

|accessdate=2009-04-16
|date=2004-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first discs were housed in [[caddy (hardware)|cartridges]] for protection, resembling [[Professional Disc]]s introduced by Sony in 2003.

Using a cartridge would increase the price of an already expensive medium, so hard-coating of the pickup surface was chosen instead. [[TDK Corporation|TDK]] was the first company to develop a working scratch-protection coating for Blu-ray Discs. It was named [[Durabis]]. In addition, both Sony and Panasonic's replication methods include proprietary hard-coat technologies. Sony's rewritable media are spin-coated, using a scratch-resistant and antistatic coating. [[Verbatim Corporation|Verbatim's]] recordable and rewritable Blu-ray Discs use their own proprietary hard-coat technology, called ScratchGuard.

The Blu-ray Disc specification requires the testing of resistance to scratches by [[Abrasion (mechanical)|mechanical abrasion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BDF physical format whitepaper&quot;/&gt; In contrast, DVD media are not required to be scratch-resistant, but since development of the technology, some companies, such as Verbatim, implemented hard-coating for more expensive lineups of recordable DVDs.

===Variants===
====Mini Blu-ray Disc====
The &quot;Mini Blu-ray Disc&quot; (also, &quot;Mini-BD&quot; and &quot;Mini Blu-ray&quot;) is a compact 8&amp;nbsp;cm (~3&amp;nbsp;in)-diameter variant of the Blu-ray Disc that can store approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;GB of data. It is similar in concept to the [[MiniDVD]] and [[MiniCD]]. Recordable (BD-R) and rewritable (BD-RE) versions of Mini Blu-ray Disc have been developed specifically for compact camcorders and other compact recording devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verbatim_MiniBR&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blu-ray Disc recordable====
{{Main|Blu-ray Disc recordable}}
&quot;Blu-ray Disc recordable&quot; refers to two [[optical disc]] formats that can be recorded with an [[optical disc recorder]]. BD-Rs can be written to once, whereas BD-REs can be erased and re-recorded multiple times. The current practical maximum speed for Blu-ray Discs is about 12Ã. Higher speeds of rotation (10,000+ rpm) cause too much wobble for the discs to be read properly, as with the 20Ã and 52Ã maximum speeds, respectively, of standard [[DVD]]s and [[Compact Disc|CDs]].

Since September 2007, [[BD-RE]] is also available in the smaller 8&amp;nbsp;cm Mini Blu-ray Disc size.&lt;ref name=&quot;Verbatim_MiniBR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20070803/137462/ Hitachi First in Industry to Release Blu-ray Disc Camcorder] Naoki Asakawa, Nikkei Electronics, Nikkei Business Publications, 2007-08-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2007, [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] and [[Mitsubishi]] codeveloped BD-R LTH (&quot;Low to High&quot; in groove recording), which features an [[organic compound|organic]] dye recording layer that can be manufactured by modifying existing CD-R and DVD-R production equipment, significantly reducing manufacturing costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=21422 | title = Pioneer and [[Mitsubishi]] Develop Low cost BD-R Discs Using Organic Recording Layers | publisher = CDRInfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, [[Taiyo Yuden]], Mitsubishi, and [[Maxell]] released the first BD-R LTH Discs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=22521 Taiyo Yuden, Mitsubishi and Maxell Release First LTH BD-R Discs] cdrinfo.com&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2008, Sony's PlayStation 3 gained official support for BD-R LTH Discs with the 2.20 firmware update.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/13371.cfm PS3 firmware update v2.20 available&amp;nbsp;â added support for LTH BD-R] afterdawn.com&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 Verbatim/Mitsubishi announced the industry's first 6X BD-R LTH media, which allows recording a 25&amp;nbsp;GB disc in about 16 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS108367+21-May-2009+BW20090521 Verbatim/MKM certified BD-R LTH type media makes performance leap to 6X] reuters.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the previous releases of 120&amp;nbsp;mm [[optical disc]]s (i.e., [[CD]]s and standard [[DVD]]s), Blu-ray recorders hit the market almost simultaneously with Blu-ray's debut.

====BD9 and BD5====
The BD9 format was proposed to the Blu-ray Disc Association by Warner Home Video as a cost-effective alternative to the 25/50&amp;nbsp;GB BD-ROM discs. The format was supposed to use the same codecs and program structure as Blu-ray Disc video, but recorded onto less expensive 8.5&amp;nbsp;GB dual-layer DVD. This red-laser media could be manufactured on existing DVD production lines with lower costs of production than the 25/50&amp;nbsp;GB Blu-ray media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=16769 |title=BD9 Licensing Further Delays The Launch of Blu-ray Burners |accessdate=2007-10-18 |date=2006-04-11 |work=cdrinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of BD9 for releasing content on &quot;pressed&quot; discs has never caught on. After the end of the format war, major producers ramped up the production of Blu-ray Discs and lowered their prices to the level of DVDs. On the other hand, the idea of using inexpensive DVD media became popular among individual users. A lower-capacity version of this format that uses single-layer 4.7&amp;nbsp;GB DVDs has been unofficially called BD5. Both formats are being used by individuals for recording high definition content in Blu-ray format onto recordable DVD media.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doom9_BDAuth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=134402 |title=Quick Blu-ray content (BD, BD-5 and BD-9) authoring guide (PS3+PowerDVD) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite the fact that the BD9 format has been adopted as part of the BD-ROM basic format, none of the existing Blu-ray player models support it explicitly. As such, the discs recorded in BD9 and BD5 formats are not guaranteed to play on standard Blu-ray Disc players.

[[AVCHD]] and [[AVCREC]] also use inexpensive media like DVDs, but unlike BD9 and BD5 these formats have limited interactivity, codec types, and data rates.

====BDXL====
The BDXL format supports 100GB and 128GB write-once discs&lt;ref name=&quot;bdxlihbd1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/news/show/Industry_Trends/BDXL/BDXL_Spec_Upgrades_Blu-ray_Storage_to_128GB/4493 |title=BDXL Spec Upgrades Blu-ray Storage to 128GB |accessdate=2010-04-06 |date=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdxlihbd2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Bluray+Disc+Association+Unveils+128GB+Specification/article18059.htm |title=Blu-ray Disc Association Unveils 128GB Specification |accessdate=2010-04-06 |date=2010-04-06 |last=McGlaun |first=Shane |work=DailyTech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100GB rewritable discs for commercial applications. It was defined in June 2010.

BD-R 3.0 Format Specification (BDXL) defined a multi-layered disc recordable in BDAV format with the speed of 2X and 4X, capable of 100/128GB and usage of UDF2.5/2.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/r3-spec.php |title=R3 Format Specification (BDXL) |author=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BD-RE 4.0 Format Specification (BDXL) defined a multi-layered disc rewritable in BDAV with the speed of 2X and 4X, capable of 100GB and usage of UDF2.5 as file system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/re4-spec.php |title=RE4 Format Specification (BDXL) |author=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BDXL discs are not compatible with existing BD drives.
[[File:SHARP BD-XL 100GB TRIPLE LAYER.jpg|thumb|100GB BDXL Triple layer disc made by Sharp]]

====IH-BD====
The IH-BD (Intra-Hybrid Blu-ray) format includes a 25GB write-once layer (BD-R) and a 25GB read-only layer (BD-ROM), designed to work with existing Blu-ray Discs.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdxlihbd1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdxlihbd2&quot; /&gt;

==Software standards==
===Filesystem===
Blu-ray Disc specifies the use of [[Universal Disk Format]] (UDF) 2.50 as a convergent friendly format for both PC and consumer electronics environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;filesystem&quot; /&gt; It is used in latest specifications of BD-ROM, BD-RE and BD-R.&lt;ref name=&quot;r2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;re3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bd-books&quot; /&gt;

In the first BD-RE specification (defined in 2002), the BDFS (Blu-ray Disc File System) was used. The BD-RE 1.0 specification was defined mainly for the [[digital recording]] of  [[High Definition Television]] (HDTV) [[broadcast television]]. The BDFS was replaced by UDF 2.50 in the second BD-RE specification in 2005, in order to enable interoperability among consumer electronics Blu-ray recorders and [[personal computer]] systems.

The Blu-ray Disc application (BDAV application) for recording of [[digital broadcasting]] has been developed as ''System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications''. The requirements related with [[computer file]] system have been specified in ''System Description Blu-ray Rewritable Disc Format part 2 File System Specifications version 1.0'' (BDFS).&lt;ref name=&quot;filesystem&quot; /&gt;

Initially, the BD-RE version 1.0 (BDFS) was specifically developed for recording of digital broadcasting using the Blu-ray Disc
application (BDAV application). To support UDF, these requirements are superseded by the ''Blu-ray Rewritable Disc File System Specifications version 2.0'' (UDF) (a.k.a. ''RE 2.0'') and ''Blu-ray Recordable Disc File System Specifications version 1.0'' (UDF) (a.k.a. ''R 1.0''). Additionally, a new application format, BDMV (''System Description Blu-ray Disc Prerecorded Format part 3 Audio Visual Basic Specifications'') for High Definition Content Distribution was developed for BD-ROM. The only file system developed for BDMV is the ''System Description Blu-ray Read-Only Disc Format part 2 File System Specifications version 1.0'' (UDF) which defines the requirements for UDF 2.50.&lt;ref name=&quot;filesystem&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bd-books&quot; /&gt;

===Media format===
====Container format====
Audio, video and other streams are [[multiplexed]] and stored on Blu-ray Discs in a [[container format (digital)|container format]] based on the [[MPEG transport stream]]. It is also known as [[MPEG transport stream#Modifications of transport stream specification for random-access media (M2TS)|BDAV MPEG-2 transport stream]] and can use filename extension [[.m2ts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bdav-videohelp&quot;&gt;Videohelp.com [http://www.videohelp.com/hd What is Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD?], Retrieved on 2009-07-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bda-av&quot; /&gt; Blu-ray Disc titles authored with menu support are in the BDMV (Blu-ray Disc Movie) format and contain audio, video, and other streams in BDAV container.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdvm&quot;&gt;AfterDawn.com [http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/bd-mv.cfm Glossary â BD-MV (Blu-ray Movie) and BDAV container], Retrieved on 2009-07-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bdav&quot;&gt;AfterDawn.com [http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/terms/bdav.cfm Glossary â BDAV container], Retrieved on 2009-07-26&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the BDAV (Blu-ray Disc Audio/Visual) format, the consumer oriented alternative to the BDMV format used for movie releases. The BDAV format is used on BD-REs and BD-Rs for audio/video recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;bdav&quot; /&gt; BDMV format was later defined also for BD-RE and BD-R (in September 2006, in the third revision of BD-RE specification and second revision of BD-R specification).&lt;ref name=&quot;r2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/r2-spec.php |title=R2 Format Specification |author=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;re3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format-spec/re3-spec.php |title=RE3 Format Specification |author=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blu-ray Disc employs the MPEG transport stream recording method. That enables transport streams of digital broadcasts to be recorded as they are without altering the format.&lt;ref name=&quot;bda-bdre&quot;&gt;Blu-ray Disc Association (March 2008) [http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/BD-RE_Part3_V2.1_WhitePaper_080406-15271.pdf BD-RE â Audiovisual Application Format Specification for BD-RE 2.1] (PDF), [http://www.blu-raydisc.com/en/Technical/TechnicalWhitePapers/BDRE.html Technical White Papers â BD RE], Retrieved on 2009-07-28&lt;/ref&gt; It also enables flexible editing of a digital broadcast that is recorded as is and where the data can be edited just by rewriting the playback stream. Although it is quite natural, a function for high-speed and easy-to use retrieval is built in.&lt;ref name=&quot;bda-bdre&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bda&quot;&gt;Blu-ray Disc Association (August 2004) [http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/general_bluraydiscformat-15263.pdf Blu-ray Disc Format, White paper] (PDF) Page 22, Retrieved on 2009-07-28&lt;/ref&gt; Blu-ray Disc Video use MPEG transport streams, compared to DVD's [[MPEG program stream]]s. This allows multiple video programs to be stored in the same file so they can be played back simultaneously (e.g., with &quot;[[Picture in picture]]&quot; effect).

====Codecs====

The [[BD-ROM]] specification mandates certain codec compatibilities for both hardware decoders (players) and movie software (content).&lt;ref name=&quot;bda-av&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/Assets/Downloadablefile/2b_bdrom_audiovisualapplication_0305-12955-15269.pdf |title=White paper Blu-ray Disc Format â 2.B Audio Visual Application Format Specifications for BD-ROM |format=PDF |page=15 |author=Blu-ray Disc Association |date=2005-03 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/en/Technical/TechnicalWhitePapers/BDROM.html |title=Technical White Papers&amp;nbsp;â BD ROM |author=Blu-ray Disc Association |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For video, all players are required to support [[MPEG-2 Part 2]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]], and [[SMPTE]] [[VC-1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/117681/bluray_disc_to_support_mpeg4_vc1.html |title=Blu-ray Disc To Support MPEG-4, VC-1|accessdate=June 15, 2011 |last=Williams |first=Martyn |date=September 2, 2004 |work=[[Pcworld.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; MPEG-2 is the compression standard used on regular [[DVD]]s, which allows [[backwards compatibility]]. MPEG-4 AVC was developed by [[MPEG]], [[Sony]], and [[Video Coding Experts Group|VCEG]]. VC-1 is a compression standard that was mainly developed by [[Microsoft]]. BD-ROM titles with video must store video using one of the three mandatory formats; multiple formats on a single title are allowed.

The choice of formats affects the producer's licensing/royalty costs as well as the title's maximum run time, due to differences in compression efficiency. Discs encoded in MPEG-2 video typically limit content producers to around two hours of high-definition content on a single-layer (25&amp;nbsp;GB) BD-ROM. The more-advanced video formats (VC-1 and MPEG-4 AVC) typically achieve a video run time twice that of MPEG-2, with comparable quality.

MPEG-2 was used by many studios (including [[Paramount Pictures]], which initially used the [[VC-1]] format for [[HD DVD]] releases) for the first series of Blu-ray Discs, which were launched throughout 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?ReleaseDate=2006 Statistics Page]. Blu-rayStats.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern releases are now often encoded in either MPEG-4 AVC or VC-1, allowing film studios to place all content on one disc, reducing costs and improving ease of use. Using these formats also frees a lot of space for storage of bonus content in HD ([[1080i]]/[[1080p|p]]), as opposed to the [[Standard Definition|SD]] ([[480i]]/[[480p|p]]) typically used for most titles. Some studios, such as [[Warner Bros.]], have released bonus content on discs encoded in a different format than the main feature title. For example, the Blu-ray Disc release of ''[[Superman Returns]]'' uses VC-1 for the feature film and MPEG-2 for some of its bonus content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehdroom.com/news/Superman_Returns_Review_Blu-ray/2505 |title=Superman Returns Review (Blu-ray)|accessdate=2011-10-27 |last=Fitzgerald |first=Shawn |date=2008-04-23 |work=TheHDRoom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Warner and other studios typically provide bonus content in the video format that matches the feature.

=====Audio=====
For audio, BD-ROM players are required to support [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3), [[DTS Coherent Acoustics|DTS]], and [[Linear pulse code modulation|linear PCM]]. Players may optionally support [[Dolby Digital Plus]] and [[Digital Theater System#DTS-HD High Resolution Audio|DTS-HD High Resolution Audio]] as well as [[Audio compression (data)#Lossless audio compression|lossless]] formats [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD Master Audio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twice.com/article/CA6323699.html|work=TWICE.com|title=1st HD DVD Players To Decode All Mandatory, Optional Audio Codecs |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |last=Palenchar |first=Joseph |date=April 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; BD-ROM titles must use one of the mandatory schemes for the primary soundtrack. A secondary audiotrack, if present, may use any of the mandatory or optional codecs.

====Bit rate====
For users recording [[digital television]] programming, the recordable Blu-ray Disc standard's initial data rate of 36&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s is more than adequate to record high-definition broadcasts from any source ([[IPTV]], cable/satellite, or terrestrial). BD Video movies have a maximum data transfer rate of 54 Mbit/s, a maximum AV bitrate of 48&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s (for both audio and video data), and a maximum video bit rate of 40&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. This compares to HD DVD movies, which have a maximum data transfer rate of 36 Mbit/s, a maximum AV bitrate of 30.24&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, and a maximum video bitrate of 29.4&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videohelp.com/hd|title=What is Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD?|accessdate=2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Java software support===
{{Main|BD-J}}
At the 2005 [[JavaOne]] trade show, it was announced that [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[Java platform|Java]] cross-platform software environment would be included in all Blu-ray Disc players as a mandatory part of the standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005JavaOne&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| last = Foote | first = Bill | coauthors = Moll, Erik | title = Java Technology Goes to the Movies: Java Technology in Next-Generation Optical Disc Formats | publisher = 2005 JavaOne conference, Session TS-7091 | url = http://www.jovial.com/slides/2005_TS-7091_Foote_Moll_DF.pdf | accessdate =2011-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Java is used to implement interactive menus on Blu-ray Discs, as opposed to the method used on [[DVD]]-video discs. DVDs use pre-rendered MPEG segments and selectable subtitle pictures, which are considerably more primitive and rarely seamless. At the conference, Java creator [[James Gosling]] suggested that the inclusion of a [[Java Virtual Machine]], as well as network connectivity in some BD devices, will allow updates to Blu-ray Discs via the Internet, adding content such as additional subtitle languages and promotional features not included on the disc at pressing time&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet_nextgen_dvd&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/Java-to-appear-in-next-gen-DVD-players/2100-1046_3-5766409.html |title=Java to appear in next-gen DVD players |last1=Shankland  |first1=Steven |date=2005-06-26 |publisher=[[cnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This Java Version is called [[BD-J]] and is a subset of the [[Globally Executable MHP]] (GEM) standard; GEM is the worldwide version of the [[Multimedia Home Platform]] standard.

===Player profiles===
The BD-ROM specification defines four Blu-ray Disc player profiles, including an audio-only player profile (BD-Audio) that does not require video decoding or [[BD-J]]. All three of the video-based player profiles (BD-Video) are required to have a full implementation of [[BD-J]], with varying levels of hardware support.

====BD-Live====
The biggest difference between Bonus View and BD-Live is that BD-Live requires the Blu-ray Disc player to have an Internet connection to access Internet-based content. BD-Live features have included Internet chats, scheduled chats with the director, Internet games, downloadable featurettes, downloadable quizzes, and downloadable movie trailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/1219/tinkerbell.html |title=Tinker Bell (Blu-ray) |first=Peter | last=Bracke |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=2008-10-28 |accessdate=2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/1437/hellboyii.html |title=Hellboy II: The Golden Army (Blu-ray) |first=Joshua |last=Zyber |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=2008-11-11 |accessdate=2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluray.highdefdigest.com/1738/kungfupanda.html |title=Kung Fu Panda (Blu-ray) |first=Kenneth | last=Brown |publisher=highdefdigest.com |date=2008-11-09 |accessdate=2009-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that while some Bonus View players may have an Ethernet port, these are used for firmware updates and are not used for Internet-based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docs.sony.com/release/specs/BDPBX1_mksp.pdf |title=Sony BDP-BX1 player specifications |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2011-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Profile 2.0 also requires more local storage in order to handle this content.

As with the implementation of [[DVD region codes|region codes for DVDs]], Blu-ray Disc players sold in a specific geographical region are designed to play only discs authorized by the content provider for that region. This is intended to permit content providers (motion picture studios, etc.) the ability to support product differences in content, price, release date, etc., by region. According to the Blu-ray Disc Association, &quot;all Blu-ray Disc players...(and) Blu-ray Disc-equipped computer systems are required to support regional coding.&quot; However, &quot;Use of region playback codes is optional for content providers...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.blu-raydisc.com/#/pages/faq &quot;How does regional coding work in the computer space?&quot;] us.blu-raydisc.com FAQ retrieved October 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some current estimates suggest 70% of available [movie] Blu-ray Discs from the major studios are region-code-free and can therefore be played on any Blu-ray Disc player, in any region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://regionfreemovies.com/ &quot;Latest Confirmed Region Free Blu-Rays&quot;]. Retrieved October 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie studios have different region coding policies. Among major U.S. studios, [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Universal Studios]] have released all of their titles region-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Paramount |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Paramount |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Universal |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Universal |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] have released most of their titles region-free.&lt;ref&gt;although titles released by Warner's [[New Line]] division were initially region-coded, but subsequently have been released without region-coding.  Titles released by other labels on behalf of New Line are still subject to region-coding.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Sony |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Sony |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Warner |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Warner |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lionsgate]] and [[Walt Disney Pictures]] have released a mix of region-free and region-coded titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Lionsgate |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Lionsgate |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Disney |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics Disney |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[20th Century Fox]] and [[MGM]] have released most of their titles region-coded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=Fox |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics 20th Century Fox|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php?OrderBy=Studio&amp;Studio=MGM |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics MGM |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blu-ray Disc region coding scheme divides the world into 3 regions, labeled A, B, and C.
* Region A includes most North, Central and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus the Republic of China (Taiwan), Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and Korea.
* Region B includes most European, African and southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.
* Region C contains the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as the People's Republic of China and Russia.

In circumvention of region coding restrictions, stand-alone Blu-ray Disc players are sometimes modified by third parties to allow for playback of Blu-ray Discs (and DVDs) with ''any'' region code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/06/26/first-region-free-blu-ray-players-available/ &quot;First Region Free Blu-ray Players Available&quot;] www.engadgethd.com. Retrieved October 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructions ('hacks') describing how to reset the Blu-ray region counter of computer player applications to make them multi-region indefinitely are also regularly posted to video enthusiast websites and forums. Unlike DVD region codes, Blu-ray region codes are verified only by the player software, not by the [[Regional Playback Control|optical drive's firmware]].

===Digital rights management===
The Blu-ray Disc format employs several layers of [[digital rights management]] (DRM).&lt;ref name=&quot;dellbd-romprotection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/vectors/brcp.pdf |title=Blu-ray Disc Next-Generation Optical Storage: Protecting Content on the BD-ROM |accessdate=2007-05-03 |publisher=[[DELL]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.com/assets/downloadablefile/5th_japan_05-13343.pdf |format=PDF|title=Overview of BD-ROM security |accessdate=2007-05-03 |author=AJIMA, Kosuke

====High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection====
Blu-ray equipment is encouraged to implement the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection ([[HDCP]]) system to encrypt the data sent by players to rendering devices through physical connections. This is aimed at preventing the copy of copyrighted content as it travels across cables. Through a [[Flag (computing)|protocol flag]] in the media stream called the [[Image Constraint Token]], a Blu-ray Disc can enforce its reproduction in a lower resolution whenever a full HDCP-compliant link is not used. In order to ease the transition to high definition formats, the adoption of this protection method has been postponed until 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacs_adopters&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title = Advanced Access Content System (&quot;AACS&quot;) Adopter Agreement | url=http://www.aacsla.com/license/AACS_Adopter_Agrmt_090619.pdf|date=2009-06|accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advanced Access Content System====
[[Image:AACS dataflow.svg|right|thumb|The AACS decryption process.]]
The [[Advanced Access Content System]] (AACS) is a standard for [[content distribution]] and [[digital rights management]]. It was developed by AS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a [[consortium]] that includes [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Panasonic]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[IBM]], [[Toshiba]], and [[Sony]].

Since appearing in devices in 2006, several successful attacks have been made on the format. The first known attack relied on the [[trusted client]] problem. In addition, decryption keys have been extracted from a weakly protected player ([[WinDVD]]). Since keys can be revoked in newer releases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aacsla.com/press/|title=Response to Reports of Attacks on AACS Technology |publisher=AACS|date=April 16, 2007|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is only a temporary attack, and new keys must continually be discovered in order to decrypt the latest discs. This [[Cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse game]] has gone through several cycles.

====BD+====
[[BD+]] was developed by [[Cryptography Research|Cryptography Research Inc.]] and is based on their concept of [[Self-Protecting Digital Content]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryptography.com/technology/spdc/bluray.html Content Protection â BD+ and Blu-ray&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] from cryptography.com&lt;/ref&gt; BD+, effectively a small [[virtual machine]] embedded in authorized players, allows content providers to include executable programs on Blu-ray Discs. Such programs can:&lt;ref name=&quot;dellbd-romprotection&quot;/&gt;
* examine the host environment to see if the player has been tampered with. Every licensed playback device manufacturer must provide the BD+ licensing authority with memory footprints that identify their devices.
* verify that the player's keys have not been changed.
* execute native code, possibly to patch an otherwise insecure system.
* transform the audio and video output. Parts of the content will not be viewable without letting the BD+ program unscramble it.

If a playback device manufacturer finds that its devices have been hacked, it can potentially release BD+ code that detects and circumvents the vulnerability. These programs can then be included in all new content releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=2010169663 |status=application |title=Systems and Methods for Detecting Authorized Players |pubdate=2010-07-01 |fdate=2009-01-22 |assign1=CYBERLINK CORPORATION}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifications of the BD+ virtual machine are available only to licensed device manufacturers. A list of licensed commercial adopters is available from the [http://www.bdplusllc.com/home/list_of_adopters_content_participants_and_eligible_code_developers BD+ website].

The first titles using BD+ were released in October 2007. Since November 2007, versions of BD+ protection have been circumvented by various versions of the [[AnyDVD]] HD program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/07/slysofts-latest-anydvd-beta-cracks-bd/ |title=SlySoft's latest AnyDVD beta cracks BD+ |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2010-07-21 |author=Darren Murph |publisher=engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/slysoft-cracks-blu-ray-bd-encryption/1542 |title=SlySoft cracks Blu-ray BD+ encryption |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2010-07-21 |author=Adrian Kingsley-Hughes |publisher=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs known to be capable of circumventing BD+ protection are DumpHD (versions 0.6 and above, along with some supporting software),&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=123111 Doom9.org]&lt;/ref&gt; MakeMKV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/145794/2010/01/bluray_ripping.html |title=Blu-ray ripping on the Mac |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2010-07-21 |author=Jonathan Seff |publisher=Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two applications from DVDFab (Passkey and HD Decrypter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5559007/the-hassle+free-guide-to-ripping-your-blu+ray-collection |title=The Hassle-Free Guide to Ripping Your Blu-Ray Collection |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-07-21 |author=Whitson Gordon |publisher=Lifehacker}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

====BD-ROM Mark====
[[ROM-Mark|BD-ROM Mark]] is a small amount of cryptographic data that is stored separately from normal Blu-ray Disc data, aiming to prevent illegal replication of the discs. The cryptographic data is needed to decrypt the copyrighted disc content protected by AACS.&lt;ref name=&quot;aacs-bd&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.aacsla.com/specifications/AACS_Spec_BD_Prerecorded_0.912.pdf |format=PDF |title=Advanced Access Content System (AACS) Blu-ray Disc Pre-recorded Book, Revision 0.912 |date=2006-07-27 |accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A specially licensed piece of hardware is required to insert the ROM-Mark into the media during replication. In consequence, sector-by-sector copies of a disc made with a regular recorder will lack the ROM-Mark data, and will be unreadable on standard players.

==Backward compatibility==
Though not compulsory, the Blu-ray Disc Association recommends that Blu-ray Disc drives be capable of reading standard DVDs and CDs, for [[backward compatibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Hitachi stated that such a disc could be used to store 7 hours of 32 Mbit/s video (HDTV) or 3 hours and 30 minutes of 64 Mbit/s video ([[4K resolution|Cinema 4K]]). In August 2006, [[TDK]] announced that they have created a working experimental Blu-ray Disc capable of holding 200&amp;nbsp;GB of data on a single side, using six 33&amp;nbsp;GB data layers.&lt;ref name=&quot;TDK200GB_announcement&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Also, behind closed doors at [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2007, [[Ritek]] revealed that they had successfully developed a High Definition optical disc process that extends the disc capacity to ten layers, which increases the capacity of the discs to 250&amp;nbsp;GB. However, they noted that the major obstacle is that current read/write technology does not support the additional layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[JVC]] has developed a three-layer technology that allows putting both standard-definition DVD data and HD data on a BD/(standard) DVD combination. If successfully commercialized, this would enable the consumer to purchase a disc that can be played on  DVD players and can also reveal its HD version when played on a BD player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At CES 2009, Panasonic unveiled the DMP-B15, the first portable Blu-ray Disc player, and Sharp introduced the LC-BD60U and LC-BD80U series, the first LCD HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray Disc players. Sharp has also announced that they will sell HDTVs with integrated Blu-ray Disc recorders in the United States by the end of 2009.  Set-top box recorders are not being sold in the U.S. due to fears of piracy. However, personal computers with Blu-ray recorder drives are available.

On January 1, 2010, Sony, in association with Panasonic, announced plans to increase the storage capacity on their Blu-ray Discs from 25GB to 33.4 GB via a technology called i-MLSE ([[Maximum likelihood]] Sequence Estimation). The higher-capacity discs, according to Sony, will be readable on current Blu-ray Disc players with a firmware upgrade. No date has been set to include the increased space, but according to Blu-ray.com &quot;it will likely happen sometime later this year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=3977 |title=FSony, Panasonic Propose Blu-ray Capacity Increase |work=Blu-ray.com |date=2010-01-04 |accessdate=2010-01-08 |last=Dreuth |first=Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 20, 2010, the research team of Sony and Japanese Tohoku University announced the joint development of a blue-violet laser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201007/10-0720E/index.html |title=Joint development of the world's first blue-violet ultrafast pulsed semiconductor laser |accessdate=2010-07-20 |date=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which will help in creating Blu-ray discs with a capacity of 1 TB (dual layer).

===Blu-ray 3D===
[[File:Blu-ray 3D.svg|thumb|148px|right|Blu-ray 3D logo.]]
The Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA) created a task force made up of executives from the film industry and the consumer electronics and IT sectors to help define standards for putting [[3-D film]] and [[3-D television]] content on a Blu-ray Disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2009/05/20/bda_taskforce/ |title=Blu-ray brains create 3D taskforce |publisher=reghardware.co.uk |date=2009-05-20 |accessdate=2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Dec. 17, 2009 the BDA officially announced 3D specs for Blu-ray Disc, allowing backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hd-report.com/2009/12/18/3d-specs-finalized-for-blu-ray-to-hit-market-next-year/ |title=3D specs finalized for Blu-ray, to hit market next year | publisher=HD Report |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2009-12-17 |last=Chabot |first=Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BDA has said, &quot;The Blu-ray 3D specification calls for encoding 3D video using the &quot;Stereo High&quot; profile defined by [[Multiview Video Coding]] (MVC), an extension to the ITU-T H.264 Advanced Video Coding (AVC) codec currently supported by all Blu-ray Disc players. MPEG4-MVC compresses both left and right eye views with a typical 50% overhead compared to equivalent 2D content, and can provide full 1080p resolution backward compatibility with current 2D Blu-ray Disc players.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20091217005371&amp;newsLang=en |title=Blu-ray Disc Association Announces Final 3D Specification | publisher=Business Wire |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means the MVC (3D) stream is backward compatible with H.264/AVC (2D) stream, allowing older 2D devices and software to decode stereoscopic video streams, ignoring additional information for the second view.

Sony has released a firmware upgrade for PlayStation 3 consoles that enables 3D Blu-ray Disc playback. They previously released support for 3D gaming on April 21, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/04/21/ps3-3-30-system-software-update/ |title=PS3 goes 3D on 10 June |work=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |last=Lempel |first=Eric |accessdate=June 14, 2011 |date=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (followed by the availability of 3D movies). Since the version 3.70 software update in August 9, 2011, the PlayStation 3 can support DTS-HD Master Audio and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio while playing 3D Blu-ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2011/08/09/ps3-system-software-update-v3-70/ |title=PS3 System Software Update (v3.70) |work=[[PlayStation.Blog]] |last=Lempel |first=Eric |accessdate=November 2, 2011 |date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolby TrueHD is used on a small minority of Blu-ray 3D releases, and is currently unsupported by the PS3. It can play 3D Blu-ray content at full 1080p.

==Variations==
===AVCHD===
{{Main|AVCHD}}
AVCHD was originally developed as a high definition format for consumer [[tapeless]] [[camcorder]]s. Derived from the Blu-ray Disc specification, AVCHD shares a similar [[random access]] directory structure, but is restricted to lower audio and video bitrates, simpler interactivity, and the use of AVC-video and Dolby AC-3 (or linear PCM) audio.

Being primarily an acquisition format, AVCHD playback is not universally supported by all devices that support Blu-Ray Disc playback.  Nevertheless, many such devices are capable of playing AVCHD recordings from removable media, such as DVDs, [[Secure Digital card|SD]]/[[Secure Digital card#SDHC|SDHC]] memory cards, &quot;[[Memory Stick]]&quot; cards, and [[hard disk drive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avchd-info.org/press/index.html |title=AVCHD Information Web Site press releases}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AVCREC===
{{Main|AVCREC}}
AVCREC uses a BDAV container to record high definition content on conventional DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-raydisc.info/format_spec/avcrec_specs.php |title=AVREC Format Specifications }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently AVCREC is tightly integrated with the Japanese [[ISDB]] broadcast standard and is not marketed outside of Japan. AVCREC is used primarily in set-top [[digital video recorder]]s and in this regard is comparable to [[HD DVD#HD REC|HD REC]].
