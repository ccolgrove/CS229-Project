Sandoval''' is a songwriter, musician, author and Grammy nominated producer and engineer. His career in music began in 1986 as the editor and publisher of a fanzine called &quot;New Breed&quot;, a project that blossomed into work as a reissue producer for such labels as Rhino and PolyGram.

In December 1989, Andrew performed his first live show as a solo musician and began professionally recording his music soon after (though his first record release did not appear until 1995).

On September 11, 2006 Andrew added DJ to his list of credits when he launched a weekly radio show called &quot;Come To The Sunshine&quot; on [http://www.luxuriamusic.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=219 www.luxuriamusic.com] which is broadcast live from Los Angeles every Monday from 4 to 6pm PST. The show repeats on Sundays from 7 to 9am PST. A website - www.cometothesunshine.com - chronicling the show was launched during the program's second series.

On December 1, 2010 Andrew received his first Grammy nomination as a producer and engineer for the Rhino release [[Where The Action Is!: Los Angeles Nuggets 1965-1968]].

Sandoval wrote the 2005 book ''[[The Monkees: The Day-by-Day Story of the 60s TV Pop Sensation]]''. Mojo magazine said of this work was &quot;The only Monkees book you needâ¦Essential reading and a poignant primer in how the template was set for today's shooting starsâ¦as close as you'll get to the official wordâ¦an engaging document of one of the '60s most important phenomena.â

The book reached a notable milestone at 2:21:34 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Thursday, August 11, 2005 when Anne Slane, a cataloguer at Worthington (Ohio) Libraries for 23 years, entered the book as the 1 billionth holding in WorldCat, the world's richest online resource for finding library materials.
