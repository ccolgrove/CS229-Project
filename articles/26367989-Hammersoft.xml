'''WGXA-DT2''' is the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated [[television station]] for [[Central Georgia]]. The station is a second digital subchannel of [[Fox Network|Fox]] affiliate [[WGXA]] that is owned by Frontier Radio Management. Over-the-air, it broadcasts a digital signal on [[UHF]] channel 16.2 from a transmitter on GA 87/[[U.S. Route 23|U.S. 23]]/[[U.S. Route 129|U.S. 129 Alternate]] along the [[Bibb County, Georgia|Bibb]] and [[Twiggs County, Georgia|Twiggs]] County line. It can also be seen on [[Cox Communications|Cox]] channel 15 and in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on digital channel 715. Syndicated programming on WGXA-DT2 includes: ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'', ''[[Extra (TV series)|Extra]]'', and ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (U.S. syndicated game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]''. 

Known on-air as '''''ABC 16''''' after WGXA's physical digital channel location, its parent station has studios on [[Martin Luther King Junior|Martin Luther King Jr.]] Boulevard ([[Georgia State Route 11|GA 11]]/[[Georgia State Route 22|GA 22]]/[[Georgia State Route 49|GA 49]]/[[U.S. Route 80|U.S. 80]]/[[U.S. Route 129|U.S. 129]]) in Downtown [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]]. The channel space for WGXA is split into two [[720p]] high definition signals for the original service and the second digital subchannel. 720p is the native broadcasting format for both networks. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/lineup_web/US:31202#lineup_1308996 January 4, 2009 aircheck of Macon television signals provided by] SilliconDust&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
On October 29, 2009, Register Communications owner of ABC affiliate [[WPGA-TV]] announced they would drop the network and go [[Independent station (North America)|Independent]] on [[New Year's Day]] 2010. The company cited current network programming that is not &quot;family-friendly,&quot; specifically homosexual content, as its reason for dropping ABC. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.macon.com/local/story/943521.html&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, WGXA entered a long-term agreement with the network and once again picked it up as an affiliate this second digital subchannel. The main channel had been Macon's original ABC affiliate from its 1983 sign-on until switching to Fox in 1996. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fox24.com/news/local/67337237.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.macon.com/149/story/897611.html#Comments_Container&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.fox24.com/inside/employment&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;mt-coxdispute&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macon.com/local/story/943521.html|title=Cox, WPGA at odds over channel placement|last=Ramati|first=Phillip|date=December 7, 2009|work=[[The Telegraph (Macon)|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cox had intended to remove WPGA from its lineup and place WGXA-DT2 on channel 6 and in high definition on digital channel 706. 

However on December 22, WPGA was granted a temporary restraining order requiring Cox to continue to carry that station on those channels. As a result, WGXA-DT2 is instead be seen on channel 15 pre-empting what is usually the channel space for [[The Inspiration Network]] until the settlement of WPGA's issues. &lt;ref name=&quot;mt-courtinjunction&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macon.com/197/story/962889.html|title=http://www.macon.com/local/story/962889.html|last=Ramati|first=Phillip|date=December 23, 2009|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=December 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.macon.com/local/story/1008669.html&lt;/ref&gt; On April 30, 2010, the court dismissed WPGA's case which would have allowed WGXA-DT2 to be seen on Cox channels 6 and 706 while WPGA is moved to another channel. However, Register filed an appeal and, in light of this, the judge ordered Cox to leave WPGA at channels 6 and 706 until an appeals court hears the case. In addition, Register also filed a petition with the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) over the status of WPGA. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macon.com/2010/05/04/1116166/judge-dismisses-wpga-lawsuit-against.html Macon Telegraph: &quot;Judge dismisses WPGA lawsuit against Cox&quot;, April 4, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2011, it was announced that the Georgia Court of Appeals upheld the ruling that would enable Cox to drop WPGA from its line-up, effective July 28. On that date, WGXA-DT2 will simulcast on its new slot on channel 6, as well as its current channel 15 position; on August 28, it will be seen on channel 6 only, with channel 15 replaced with another channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macon.com/2011/06/23/1606565/cox-to-drop-wpga-in-july.htm Macon Telegraph: &quot;Cox to drop WPGA in July&quot;, June 23, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 12, 2011 Register filed a complaint Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia, seeking an injunction to prevent Cox from not only dropping WPGA, but from giving channel 6 to WGXA-DT2. However, Cox announced that their plan will continue anyway, despite the complaint, as the previous court case authorised them to make the changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macon.com/2011/07/12/1629290/wpga-takes-cable-company-fight.html Macon Telegraph: &quot;WPGA takes cable company fight to federal court&quot;, July 12, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Newscasts==
[[File:Wgxa news logo.png|thumb|right|Its news logo.]]

Starting March 1, 2010, there were new weeknight 7 and 11 o'clock broadcasts (along with weekday morning ''[[Good Morning America]]'' local cut-ins) added to WGXA-DT2 which required an expansion of the news department and personnel. These newscasts have a separate anchor team but utilize the same reporting, weather, and sports personnel. The 7 p.m. show competes with a newscast that airs on [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate [[WMGT-DT2]]. 

In a report in the May 28, 2010 edition of ''[[The Macon Telegraph]]'', it was announced that talk show hosts Kenny Burgamy, Charles Richardson, and Liz Fabian would no longer be hosting a morning show on WPGA-TV and [[WPGA-FM]] 100.9 after July 20. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.macon.com/2010/05/28/1143258/telegraph-fox-abc-940-am-to-partner.html#ixzz0pIoURlcA&lt;/ref&gt; The morning news, talk, information, and entertainment show moved to the WGXA stations as well as [[WMAC]]-AM 940 on July 26. The program currently airs on weekdays from 6 to 7 on WGXA-DT2 and from 6 to 9 on the main signal. The ''Good Morning America'' weather cut-ins continue to be seen as well.
