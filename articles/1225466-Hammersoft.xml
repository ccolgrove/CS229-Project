'''Clevedon''' is a rural town in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], located in the Franklin ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of Auckland city. The town is governed by the [[Auckland Council]].

The town and surrounding rural area has a population of 2,508 (2006 census),&lt;ref&gt;{{NZ Quickstats|3525201|Clevedon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the centre of an administrative ward of Manukau which takes in much of the largely rural area to the east of the urban heart of the city.

Clevedon is located on the [[Wairoa River, Auckland|Wairoa River]] five kilometres from its estuary and outflow into the [[Tamaki Strait]], an arm of the [[Hauraki Gulf]]. It is 14 kilometres from the centre of the suburb of Manukau, which lies to the northwest. To the south of Clevedon rise the rugged hills of the [[Hunua Ranges]]. Several popular beaches are located on the coast close to Clevedon, including [[Duder's Beach]] and [[Kawakawa Bay]].  Between these two beaches lies the [[Duder Regional Park]].

Clevedon was named for [[Clevedon]], [[England]], in 1866. It was previously known as Te Wairoa ([[MÄori language|MÄori]]: 'the Long River').

There were formerly many schools located in Clevedon (the Wairoa district) but only one remains, Clevedon School.
