The '''[[2006 NFL season|2006]] [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] season''' began with the team trying to improve on their 11-5 record in [[2005 NFL season|2005]].

==Summary==
After winning the division in 2005, the Buccaneers suffered through an abysmal 2006 season. The season was plagued by injuries, with starters such as G [[Dan Buenning]], WR [[Michael Clayton (American football)|Michael Clayton]], RB [[Carnell Williams]], DE [[Simeon Rice]], CB [[Brian Kelly (cornerback)|Brian Kelly]], and QB [[Chris Simms]] all being placed on injured reserve at some point in the season. The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs, such as QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]], T [[Jeremy Trueblood]], and G [[Davin Joseph]]. The league schedule was also unfriendly to the Bucs, scheduling them for 3 games (two of them away games) within 11 days of each other.

There was more to the lost season than just injuries however, as most of the players put on injured reserve had been done so after the team's 0-3 start, and offensive shutouts in the first two games in which no touchdowns were scored by the Buccaneers. The departure of several key defensive coaches and assistants didn't bode well with players, who complained to some in the media of not being able to hear coaches in team meetings.

Inconsistent and unorganized are how some players referred to one of the newcomers, who most players had a hard time making the transition from long time favorites [[Rod Marinelli]] and others. Some believe the problems in 2006 were rooted in recent years mistakes, lack of salary cap room to bring in high impact free agents, lack of top 50 draft picks over the last 5 or 6 years due to trades, and maybe even a failure to properly assess talent resulting in a lack of contribution from second day draft picks in recent history.

The Bucs started off the season 0-3, with QB [[Chris Simms]] throwing only 1 touchdown to 7 interceptions. In the third game of the season, a last-minute loss to the Carolina Panthers, Simms's [[spleen]] was ruptured, and he was placed on injured reserve for the rest of the season. After their bye week, the Bucs elected to start rookie quarterback [[Bruce Gradkowski]], a 6th-round pick from Toledo.

Gradkowski started off performing decently. People who in hindsight claim the Bucs should have started the more experienced [[Tim Rattay]] forget the Bucs nearly upset the New Orleans Saints, and then went on to win two narrow victories: one, against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], winning on an overturned call resulting in a touchdown; and another against the Philadelphia Eagles, thanks to [[Matt Bryant]]'s 62-yard field goal. After these victories, though, Gradkowski's performance declined. After a 3-17 loss to the New York Giants in heavy winds, the Bucs proceeded to lose 5 of their next 6 games, leading them to a record of 3-10 (0-6 in their division). In the loss to the Atlanta Falcons, Gradkowski was replaced in the 4th quarter by Rattay.

In the first half of the Bucs' next game, against the Chicago Bears, Gradkowski was again replaced by Rattay, who led the team from a 24-3 deficit to a score of 31-31, with three touchdowns in the fourth quarter. However, the Bucs then lost the game in overtime, 34-31. Rattay was then named the new starting quarterback for the last two games for the season. The Bucs finished their season with a 4-12 record, tied for third worst in the NFL. The overall defense was ranked in the low 20's, the first time time a Tampa defense was not ranked in the top ten since 1996.

The Bucs sent three players to the [[2007 Pro Bowl]], cornerback [[Ronde Barber]], tight end/long snapper [[Dave Moore (American football player)|Dave Moore]] (A &quot;Need&quot; player according to Saints coach [[Sean Payton]]), and late addition outside linebacker [[Derrick Brooks]](as an injury replacement). This would be Brooks's 10th consecutive Pro Bowl and 10th Pro Bowl overall.

==Offseason==
In the [[2006 NFL Draft]], the Buccaneers used their first pick on Oklahoma Guard [[Davin Joseph]]. They then used their next pick on Boston College OT [[Jeremy Trueblood]]. The rest of their picks included Notre Dame WR [[Maurice Stovall]], Penn St. CB [[Alan Zemaitis]], Stanford DE [[Julian Jenkins]], Toledo QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]], North Carolina St. TE [[T.J. Williams]] (who was lost for the upcoming season to injury when he tore his right Achilles tendon the week of June 19), Oregon CB [[Justin Phinisee]], Clemson DE [[Charles Bennett (football player)|Charles Bennett]], and Michigan TE [[Tim Massaquoi]].

After a potential season-ending injury to backup [[quarterback]] [[Luke McCown]], the Buccaneers signed veteran quarterback [[Jay Fiedler]] to back up [[Chris Simms]] on June 29. The signing maintains the four-deep status of the backup quarterback position, as [[Tim Rattay]], [[Jared Allen]], and [[Bruce Gradkowski]] are still on the roster (as of July 18). Additionally, the team signed two-year veteran [[tight end]] [[Matt Kranchick]] to replace T.J. Williams, who was lost for the season due to injury, as noted above.

The Buccaneers opened the regular season at home against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on September 10 with a shutout, their first since Week 14 of the 2005 season. The game began with the Ravens scoring a touchdown after a clock-killing 80-yard drive, and the Bucs were never able to respond. Bucs QB [[Chris Simms]] threw three interceptions and many of his passes were batted down at the line of scrimmage, an issue that was present during the pre-season and would continue to plague Simms in the next two games. In addition, second-year RB [[Carnell Williams|Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams]] struggled with back spasms and was held to just 22 rushing yards on 8 carries.

The Bucs went to the [[Georgia Dome]] for a Week 2 contest against their division rival, the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. Historically, the Buccaneers had been able to effectively contain Falcons' QB [[Michael Vick]], shutting down the Falcons' offense in the process. However, the Bucs' performance here had not improved much from Week 1. The defense was unable to stop the running duo of Vick and RB [[Warrick Dunn]], whose combined performance netted 261 yards, and 306 for Atlanta as a teamâa new Falcons team record. Also illustrating their sharp fall in performance from their #1 NFL ranking the previous season, the Bucs' defense also allowed a 1-yard QB TD run by Vick and a 4-yard TD pass to RB [[Fred McCrary]]. Bucs QB [[Chris Simms]] continued to struggle, throwing another three interceptions, while [[Carnell Williams|Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams]] was held to just 37 yards on 15 carries. The Bucs' only points came on a chip-shot 22-yard field goal by kicker [[Matt Bryant]].

The Bucs played one of their most heated rivals, the [[Carolina Panthers]], at home. In the first half, it was a rout 20-7 with Bucs QB [[Chris Simms]]' first pass intercepted by the Panthers' [[Chris Gamble]]. In the second quarter, Tampa Bay finally scored its first touchdown of the season on a short pass from Simms to [[Joey Galloway]], then followed that up in the third quarter with [[Carnell Williams]] scoring his first TD run of the season. Later that quarter, Simms led a drive that was wrapped up by a 2-yard bootleg by Simms on a fake to [[Mike Alstott]], but Simms was hit hard on the play, and had to leave the game momentarily to let rookie [[Bruce Gradkowski]] take over. Simms returned in the fourth quarter to lead another scoring drive which ended with a long field goal by [[Matt Bryant]]. Unfortunately for the Bucs, the Panthers' kicker [[John Kasay]] hit his fourth field goal of the day, winning the game for the Panthers with only six seconds to spare. After the game, it was learned that Simms had a ruptured [[spleen]] and went into emergency surgery to remove it. Originally diagnosed as bruised ribs, it was only discovered shortly after the game ended. If discovery had been delayed any longer, Simms would have died. The injury cost Simms the rest of the season.

===Week 4: Open date===
The Buccaneers bye week was scheduled for week 4.

Coming off their bye week, the Buccaneers were still looking for their first win of the season. The Bucs traveled to the [[Louisiana Superdome]] for their third divisional match-up in a rowâthis time, against the [[New Orleans Saints]]. The Bucs scored first as rookie QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]] threw a 18-yard TD pass to WR [[Joey Galloway]] in the first quarter; the Saints responded with a 21-yard field goal from kicker [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]]. The Saints continued scoring, with a 24-yard TD run from RB [[Deuce McAllister]] in the second quarter, and a 9-yard TD pass to TE [[Ernie Conwell]] in the third quarter. The Bucs finally responded with a 1-yard TD run from FB [[Mike Alstott]], and took the lead in the fourth quarter with Gradkowski's 3-yard TD pass to TE [[Alex Smith (tight end)|Alex Smith]]. Unfortunately for the Bucs, a special teams breakdown led to Saints RB [[Reggie Bush]] getting his inaugural NFL touchdown on a 65-yard punt return, which sealed the win for the Saints.

===Week 6: vs. Cincinnati Bengals===

The Bucs were predicted by many as an underdog by several sports commentators to defeat the 3-1 Bengals, and they pulled off an upset win, with Bruce Gradkowski throwing 2 touchdowns, and Cadillac Williams running for 94 yards. With 34 seconds remaining in the 4th quarter, Gradkowkski threw a pass to wide receiver [[Michael Clayton (American football)|Michael Clayton]], who appeared to cross the goal line in a dive, but dropped the football in the end zone. The pass was initially ruled incomplete. The replay official initiated a review, and referee [[Mike Carey (American football official)|Mike Carey]] determined that Clayton had possession of the football when he crossed the plain of the goal line. The call was reversed, and the Buccaneers were awarded the touchdown. At the end of regulation, [[Shayne Graham]] had a chance to win the game with a 62-yard field goal, but missed it wide right, giving the Bucs their first win of 2006.

===Week 7: vs. Philadelphia Eagles===

The Bucs entered week 7 against an Eagles team looking to build upon their 14-13 win over the Bengals. The Bucs defense stepped up big early, particularly [[Ronde Barber]], who returned two [[Donovan McNabb]] interceptions for touchdowns. The Bucs however blew a 17-point lead when [[Brian Westbrook]] scored on a 52 yard touchdown with 33 seconds left. With two timeouts remaining, the Bucs drove to the Philadelphia 45 yard line with 4 seconds left. Kicker [[Matt Bryant]] then converted on an improbable, franchise record 62-yard field goal as time expired to give the Bucs a 23-21 victory. Ironically, the kick was the same distance [[Cincinnati Bengals|Bengals]]' [[Shayne Graham]] missed from the previous week. The Bucs improved to 2-4. The kick was one yard short of the NFL record (63 yards) and the second-longest game-winning field goal in NFL history.

Hoping to build off their dramatic home win over the Eagles, the Buccaneers flew to [[Giants Stadium]] for their Week 8 game with the [[New York Giants]]. Bucs CB [[Ronde Barber]] would be facing his brother, RB [[Tiki Barber]] for the last time in NFL competition as the latter planned to retire after the season. In the first quarter, Tampa Bay fell behind early, as QB [[Eli Manning]] completed a 7-yard TD pass to WR [[Plaxico Burress]] for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bucs' woes continued as Giants RB [[Brandon Jacobs]] got a 1-yard TD run. Kicker [[Matt Bryant]] would get Tampa Bay a 43-yard field goal, but that would all of the points that the Bucs would get, because after a scoreless third quarter, Giants kicker [[Jay Feely]] kicked a 31-yard field goal to put the game away.

In the second quarter, kicker [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]] helped New Orleans improve its lead with a 46-yard field goal. Tampa Bay would valiantly fight back, as QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]] completed a 44-yard TD pass and a 17-yard TD pass to WR [[Joey Galloway]], but that would be as close as they would get. In the third quarter, Saints pulled away with RB [[Deuce McAllister]] completing a 3-yard TD run and Bree completing a 45-yard TD pass to Henderson.

The [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] entered week 15 of the NFL season hoping to secure a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs. The Bears led 24-3 win 5:22 left in the third quarter and were en route to winning their third straight, but the Buccaneers had other plans.

Coach [[Jon Gruden]] sent in back-up [[Tim Rattay]] who completed 20 of 35 for 268 yards with 3 touchdowns and one interception as the Bucs battled back to tie the game up at 31 during the 4th quarter. A controversial move was made by Chicago Bear's head coach [[Lovie Smith]] as he decided to let time expire during the 4th quarter and thus send the game into overtime. Tampa Bay won the coin toss, and both teams had three possessions in overtime. After missing earlier in the overtime period, [[Robbie Gould]] connected on a 27-yard field goal with 3:37 remaining to give the Bears the victory, 34-31.
