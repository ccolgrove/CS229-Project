The '''Salvadoran Football Association''' ({{lang-es|FederaciÃ³n SalvadoreÃ±a de FÃºtbol}} or {{lang|es|FESFUT}}) is the official governing [[football (soccer)|football]] organization in [[El Salvador]] and is in charge of the [[El Salvador national football team]].  The federation is also in charge of the three tiers of domestic club competition, including the top-flight [[Primera DivisiÃ³n de FÃºtbol Profesional]]. On May 11, 2010, it was confirmed that FIFA had sanctioned and suspended teams and associated members from international competition on account of government interference with the federation, something FIFA condemns and prohibits. This decision by FIFA was based on the fact that the statutes ratified by the FESFUT general assembly in August 2009 had not been formally entered in the countryâs official register, and that the government had failed to acknowledge the authority of the Normalisation Committee set up to represent FESFUT. Consequently, FIFA considered that it was not possible for FESFUT to organise the elective general assembly in line with the action plan that had been drawn up and suspended FESFUT. For the suspension to be lifted, Salvadoran authorities needed to recognize the legitimacy of the Normalisation Committee. On May 28, the suspension was lifted.

On July 31, 2010, the general assembly of football elected Carlos MÃ©ndez as the new president of the federation. Carlos MÃ©ndez received 27 out of the 40 votes from the delegates.

In November 2010 the association started the first [[women's association football|women's football]] league.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.de/translate?hl=de&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.laprensagrafica.com%2Fdeportes%2Ffutbol-nacional%2F149319-el-toque-femenino.html laprensagrafica.com]; Football finally has a women's league&lt;/ref&gt;
