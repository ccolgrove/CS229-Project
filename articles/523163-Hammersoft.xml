'''Cazenovia College''' is a small, independent, co-educational, baccalaureate college, located in [[Cazenovia, New York]].

==History==
Cazenovia College began in 1824 as the Genesee Seminary.  It was sponsored by the [[Methodist Church]] but was a non-sectarian institution.  It was initially located in the old [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]] Courthouse.  Cazenovia was co-educational from its foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwdev.cazenovia.edu/default.aspx?tabid=104 Cazenovia College History page from Cazenovia College website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the institution was known as [[Cazenovia Seminary]].  It was known as the Oneida and Genesee Conference Seminary, the Oneida Conference Seminary and the Central New York Conference Seminary over the years.  It did not officially adopt the name Cazenovia Seminary until 1894, but the name was at times used from its inception and is often used to refer to it at any time before it became a college.

In 1942 Church sponsorship of Cazenovia was withdrawn, and it was reorganized to include a junior college program as well as the prep school, with the name of Cazenovia Junior College.  It then became Cazenovia College for Women in 1961.  In 1982 it returned to being co-educational and adopted its present name, although it was not recognized as a bachelors degree granting institution until 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwdev.cazenovia.edu/default.aspx?tabid=104 Cazenovia College history]&lt;/ref&gt;
