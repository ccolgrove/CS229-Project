'''Widener University School of Law''' is the [[American Bar Association|ABA]] accredited law school of [[Widener University]].  The school, founded in 1971 as the '''Delaware Law School''', operates on two of Widener's campuses, one in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]], and the other in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], [[Pennsylvania]].

==History==
Originally founded in 1971 as the Delaware Law School, the institution became affiliated with [[Widener University]] in 1975 and graduated its first class of 267 that year.  The school's name was officially changed to Widener University School of Law in 1989 when the [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] campus was added.  With a current enrollment of over 1600 students, Widener Law has grown to become the largest of all Pennsylvania area law schools.

==Campuses==
===Delaware===
Strategically located in [[Wilmington]], the corporate capital of the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.pepperlaw.com/office.aspx?OfficeKey=9| title =Wilmington | publisher = Pepper Hamilton| accessdate =2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widener's 40 acre campus is home to nearly 1,100 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.widener.edu/Media/Website%20Resources/institutionalresearch/QuickFacts2010%20Law%20School.pdf| title = Delaware Campus Quick Facts| publisher = Widener University School of Law| accessdate =2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus offers numerous degrees, many with an emphasis on corporate law.

===Harrisburg===
The [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] campus is located minutes from the [[Pennsylvania State Capitol|state capitol]] building and [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|downtown]] Harrisburg. The 22 acre campus is home to the Widener Law &amp; Government Institute, which specializes in the study and improvement of government law.  The Harrisburg campus boasts a total enrollment of approximately 500 full time and part time students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.law.widener.edu/about/dean_hb.shtml| title =Office of the Dean, Harrisburg Campus | publisher = Widener University School of Law| accessdate =2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
===Overview===
Widener provides a comprehensive legal education program including offering its students the opportunity to work on court cases through legal clinics. The clinics specialize in environmental law, criminal defense, and civil law; which includes bankruptcy, family law, and legal assistance on veteran benefits cases. Another opportunity provided to its students is the Trial Advocacy Institute which offers an eight-day training program that teaches students how to conduct themselves properly in a courtroom trial.

In addition to legal clinics and the Trial Advocacy Institute, Widener offers certification in specialized fields of study. At the Delaware campus it offers special certification from the Health Law Institute, the Institute of Delaware Corporate Law, and Trial Advocacy Institute. At the Harrisburg campus special certification is available through the Law and Government Institute.&lt;ref name=&quot;certificates&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.law.widener.edu/academics/certificate/index.shtml| title =Certificate Programs &amp; Institutes at Widener Law: Focusing On Individual Areas of Law| publisher = Widener University School of Law| accessdate =2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both campuses offer a variety of pro-bono work or community outreach opportunities through the Public Interest Initiative on the Harrisburg campus or the Public Interest Resource Center on the Delaware campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=July 9, 2006 |url =http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?Date=20060709&amp;Category=NEWS03&amp;ArtNo=607090341&amp;Ref=AR| title =Youths learn basics of finance | publisher = Delaware Online| first=Michele |last= Besso| accessdate =2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students also have the opportunity to participate in extra and co-curricular activities such as [[Moot court]], Moe Levine Trial Advocacy Honor Society, and three law reviews; ''The [[Delaware Journal of Corporate Law]]'', ''The [http://widenerlawjournal.org/ Widener Law Journal]'', and ''The [[Widener Law Review]]''.

===Grading curve===
Widener's grading policy is self-described as rigorous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grading_Policy&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://law.widener.edu/CampusLife/CareerDevelopment/RecruitWidenerStudentsandAlumni/WhyHireWidener/OurGradingCurve.aspx| publisher=Widener University| title=Widener's Grading Curve/Ranking Policy| accessdate=2008-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike most law schools, Widener's policy allows the average grade for first-year courses to be set as low as 2.3, which equates to a grade point average between a  &quot;C&quot; and a &quot;C+.&quot; The average grade for upper level courses purports to be only slightly more lenient.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grading_Policy&quot;/&gt;
This low grading curve has been the source of controversy for some students.  According to a 2007 student survey conducted by the Princeton Review and sanctioned by the school, &quot;Widener's C grading curve is also a source of frustration.  Students worry that their curved grade point averages might not stack up to their competitors, 'causing us to lose out on job opportunities.'&quot;  In the same survey, students insist that the current grading policy requires some much needed reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Princeton_Review Survey&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.princetonreview.com/law/research/profiles/studentsSay.asp?listing=1035848&amp;category=5&amp;LTID=5| publisher=Princeton Review| title=Student Survey| accessdate=2007-09-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ranking===
In the 2012 edition of [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'s ''Best Law School Rankings'', Widener is classified as a &quot;Second Tier&quot; law school and is not given a numerical value.&lt;ref&gt;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings/page+8&lt;/ref&gt;  The median LSAT score and the median GPA for the class entering in 2010 were 151 and 3.14 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.widener.edu/Admissions/ApplyasaJDStudent/AdmissionsFAQ.aspx#8|title=Admissions FAQ|publisher=Widener Law|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study abroad===
Study abroad is offered through the Summer International Law Institute. There are five institutes available to students; Kenya, Switzerland, Italy, Australia and the most recent addition of China. While abroad students sometimes have the ability to go out on internships with international organizations.

==Post-graduation==
