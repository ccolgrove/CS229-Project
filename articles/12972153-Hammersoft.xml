The '''Liard Highway''', numbered '''Highway 77''' in [[British Columbia]] and '''Highway 7''' in the [[Northwest Territories]], is a [[highway]] in [[Canada]], which forms the sole road connection between B.C. and the Northwest Territories.

The highway officially opened to traffic in 1984 and was assigned the number 77 in 1986. Highway 77 begins at a point on the [[Alaska Highway]] 28 km (17&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]], and it travels 138 km (86&amp;nbsp;mi) northeast along an expanse of flat land to the border of British Columbia and the Northwest Territories, where it continues as a very rough dirt and gravel road under the 'Highway' 7 designation for 254 km through the Northwest Territories, ending at a junction with [[Mackenzie Highway|Highway 1]] south of [[Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories|Fort Simpson]].
