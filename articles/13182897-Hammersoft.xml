====2007====
Lewis was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the 6th round, being the 185 overall pick in the [[2007 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PlayerProfile&quot; /&gt;
He is the fourth Washburn University player ever to be drafted to an NFL team, joining offensive tackle [[Ed Schneider]], who was picked in the 17th round and the 169th overall pick by the [[New York Giants]] in 1944 and outside linebacker [[Troy Stedman]], who was picked 170th overall by the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in the seventh round of the [[1988 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;49abcnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.49abcnews.com/news/2007/apr/29/washburn_dt_trey_lewis_drafted| title=Washburn DT Trey Lewis drafted| date=2007-04-29|accessdate=2008-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another Washburn Player is on this list but is not listed because he was not signed by the team that drafted him and never played in the NFL.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rquote|left|He's shown a lot of good things, Coming in as a rookie, he's accepting his responsibility now.

Lewis made his first start of the season against the [[Houston Texans|Texans]] on September 30, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantafalcons.com&quot;/&gt; Teammate Michael Boley said of Lewis starting &quot;He's shown a lot of good things, Coming in as a rookie, he's accepting his responsibility now. With us releasing Grady, there's going to be a big weight on his shoulders and I think he's going to take it in stride.&quot; He was then listed as the Starting Defensive Tackle in week 10 after the Falcons cut veteran [[Grady Jackson]]. During training camp, his number was listed as #67, because in college, he was #76, but that number was already taken. Then his number was changed to #97 before the season began because an older falcons player had the same number as him. He finished the [[2007 NFL season]] with 23 tackles and one interception. Because of his size, Lewis played both Defensive Tackle and Nose Tackle during the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlantafalcons.com&quot;/&gt; According To Lewis, the most hard adjustment from NCAA Division II to the NFL was working on his Technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On March 4, 2008, Lewis fell down a set of stairs and re-injured his right knee. Falcons coach [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] said &quot;It's tough for us, but it is also disappointing for Trey because he was making tremendous progress in his rehabilitation,&quot;. His Agent, [[Richard Katz (Agent)|Richard Katz]], told reporters &quot;He's having some surgery this week. Basically, he's lost the three months that he's been rehabbing&quot;'.

I just thought something was weird. I didn't know until a couple days later when I got a call with the results of the MRI. You just have to pick up the pieces and start over again.&quot;&lt;ref name='post-injury' /&gt;
Since his injury, Lewis has been cleared to participate in organized team activities, including on-field work, but he wants to make sure he remains healthy for the rigors of the preseason.&lt;ref name='post-injury' /&gt; He was quotes as saying &quot;As of right now I want to get through this offseason program and make sure everything is good,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever.&quot;&lt;ref name='post-injury' /&gt; When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: &quot;I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to see what I can do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee).&quot;&lt;ref name='post-injury' /&gt; He competed for the starting job in the [[2009 NFL Season]].&lt;ref name='post-injury' /&gt;

Lewis was inactive for the first 2 weeks, but after DT [[Peria Jerry]] was placed on Injured Reserve, Lewis was bumped up a spot on the depth chart.&lt;ref name='firstinawhile'&gt;{{cite news | first=John | last=Manasso | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Smith: Falcons lost some focus in New England | date=2009-09-28 | publisher= | url =http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2009/09/22-30/Smith_Falcons_lost_some_focus_in_New_England.aspx | work =Atlanta Falcons.com | pages = | accessdate = 2009-09-28 | language = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, 2009, against the New England Patriots, Lewis played in his first regular season NFL game since November 2007.&lt;ref name='firstinawhile' /&gt; He amassed 6 tackles.

===Impact===
[[Cary Williams]], a Washburn defensive back who was drafted in the 7th round of the [[2008 NFL Draft]] by the [[Tennessee Titans]], was scouted heavily by scouts coming into the NFL draft. Williams stated that if it hadn't been for Trey Lewis being scouted and drafted, he would not have had a chance at even being scouted. &quot;Trey really opened the door for Washburn (University),&quot; Williams said in an interview with KTKA-49 News in Topeka. KS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
