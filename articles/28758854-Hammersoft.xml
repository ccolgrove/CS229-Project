The club then consolidated their top flight status with an eighth place finish.

===1930s team===
[[File:SCowan1.JPG|thumb|190px|left|Captain [[Sam Cowan]] collecting the FA Cup from [[King George V]] after City triumph in 1935]]


In the 1930s Manchester City began to challenge for honours, regularly challenging for the prestigious FA Cup on numerous occasions in the 30s. 

The team of the 1930s featured some famous names such as [[Matt Busby]] who would later go on to manage Manchester United, [[Frank Swift]] with hands the finger span of 12&amp;nbsp;inches&lt;ref name=&quot;swime&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Sporting hero: Frank Swift |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/71/71756_sporting_hero_frank_swift.html |publisher=menmedia.co.uk |date=2 November 2003 |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is still regarded as one of the best goalkeepers of all time,&lt;ref name=&quot;swime&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Goal.com's Top 50 English Players: Frank Swift (25) |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/2274/goalcoms-top-50-english-players/2009/05/22/1280068/goalcoms-top-50-english-%0A%0Aplayers-frank-swift-25 |publisher=goal.com |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; only the war hiatus preventing him for playing more times for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frank Swift : Obituary |url=http://www.thisisannouncements.co.uk/5848259 |publisher=thisisannouncements.co.uk |date=6 February 1958 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frank Swift was a giant for Man City |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2291365/Frank-Swift-was-a-giant-for-Man-City.html |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=5 September 2010 |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first=James |last=Mossop}}&lt;/ref&gt; the elusive but injury-prone striker [[Fred Tilson]] and influential captain, [[Sam Cowan]] who introduced Tilson to the King at the final saying, &quot;''This is Tilson, your Majesty. He's playing today with two broken legs.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fred Tilson |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/MANCtilson.htm |publisher=spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-place finish and FA Cup semi-final (1932)===
The club finished third in the league in 1930, and were narrowly defeated by [[Herbert Chapman]]'s [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the semi-finals of the 1932 FA Cup, losing to a last minute goal. 

===FA Cup runners-up - Cowan: &quot;We'll win it next year&quot; (1933)===
In the early 1930s, Cowan became Manchester City captain, succeeding [[Jimmy McMullan]]. During his captaincy the club reached two further [[FA Cup Final|FA Cup finals]]. The first of these was in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]], against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. During the match Cowan was up against Everton captain [[Dixie Dean]]. Both players were renowned for their heading ability. [[Matt Busby]] claimed that Cowan could &quot;head a ball as far as most of us could kick it&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City â The Complete Record'', p.&amp;nbsp;170.&lt;/ref&gt; but Dean prevailed in the aerial battle, scoring Everton's second goal with a header. The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' observed that Dean's presence gave Cowan a dilemma: &quot;He was torn between a determination not to leave Dean and a desire to help his forwards. He broke down between the two.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary |last=James |title=Manchester: The Greatest City |publisher=Polar |location=Leicester | year=2002 |isbn=1-899538-22-4}} p136&lt;/ref&gt; Everton were 3â0 victors, but when Cowan received his runner's up medal from the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]], he remarked that he would come back next year to win.&lt;ref&gt;Some sources mistakenly state that the remark was made to [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], who did not attend the 1933 final.&lt;/ref&gt; True to Cowan's word, City returned to [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] the following year.

===Finally FA Cup victory - Cowan fulfils his promise (1934)===
City were gaining a reputation as FA Cup specialists of recent years and in 1934 during another cup run, 84,559 exuberant packed [[Maine Road]] to see City play [[Stoke City]] in the quarter-final,&lt;ref&gt;James, Manchester City â The Complete Record, p524&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Record home attendances of English football clubs|attendance record which still stands to this day]].  In the [[1934 FA Cup Final]], Cowan became the first and thus far only Manchester City player to represent the club in three FA Cup finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof156&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; He captained City to a 2â1 victory over [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. As team captain Cowan held primary responsibility for motivating his fellow players and match tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Graham |title=Terrace Heroes: The Life and Times of the 1930s Professional Footballer |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2004 |isbn=0-7146-5359-4 |page= 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was typical for a captain of his era, as [[Coach (sport)|managers]] of the period were chiefly administrators who had little input into coaching and tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot;/&gt;

The season after the FA Cup truimph, the club [[1934â35_Football_League#First_Division|finished fourth in the league in the 1934-35 season]] and failed to build on their good FA Cup record of late losing 1-0 to [[Tottenham Hotspur|Tottenham]] in the third round. In the following [[1935â36_Football_League#First_Division|1935-36 season City struggled finishing ninth in the league]], however this proved to be the penultimate season that Manchester City would not have the honour of First Division champions.

===Champions finally (1937)===
City finally claimed their maiden [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title [[1936â37_Football_League#First_Division|in 1937]] after being runners-up twice in [[1903â04_Football_League#First_Division|1903-04]] and in [[1920â21 Football League|1920-21]] and third place finished thrice in [[1904â05 Football League|1904-05]], [[1907â08 Football League|1907-08]] and [[1929â30_Football_League#First_Division|1929-30]]. City strolled to victory as they scored over 100 goals, the only team to do so during the season and were unbeaten for 22 matches in the league.

===Reigning champions relegated (1938)===
However they were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=England 1937/38| work=league table from RSSSF | url=http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1937-38.html| accessdate=December 29, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event has been attributed to ''[[Manchester_City_F.C._supporters#.27Typical_City.27_syndrome|typical City syndrome]]'' and City remain the only reigning champions to be relegated in English football.

===War hiatus (1939â1945)===
After a season in the Second Division, play was suspended due to the onset of World War II. During this six year period, a [[Wartime League]] was introduced, however this was set up as sporting entertainment aimed at providing morale to the ordinary people in towns and cities across [[England]]. Some players chose to play for City during the war and some played as ''guests'' for other teams such as [[Frank Swift]], whilst others like [[Jackie Bray]] joined the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1940 to help the war efforts and was awarded a [[British Empire Medal]] for his endeavours during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Football and the Second World War |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWfootball.htm |publisher=spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |accessdate=5 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post war (1946â1964) ==
=== Former captain Cowan takes over and gains promotion (1946-47) ===
When play resumed after the war, Cowan became Manchester City manager in November 1946, succeeding [[Wilf Wild]], who moved to a purely administrative role.&lt;ref name=&quot;mre&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Penney |first=Ian |title=The Maine Road Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |year=1995 |isbn=1-85158-710-1 |pages= 49â50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowan had been known for his motivational skills as a player, and was part of a new generation of managers who took responsibility for tactics and team selection, of which Cowan's contemporary and former defensive team mate at City [[Matt Busby]] became the most well-known. 

Cowan was given a salary of Â£2,000, and came to an agreement whereby he spent part of the week with the Manchester City team and part looking after his business interests in Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City â The Complete Record'', p.&amp;nbsp;243.&lt;/ref&gt; His first match as manager was a 3â0 win against [[Newport County F.C.|Newport County]], and the team then embarked upon a run of 19 matches without defeat. Despite achieving the Division Two title in his first season in charge, Cowan resigned in June 1947 as his commute from Brighton caused tension with club officials.&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Manchester City â The Complete Record'', p.&amp;nbsp;245.&lt;/ref&gt; His resignation was perhaps unfortunate, despite City having a post-war squad far capable of being in the second tier of English football, as former captain he impressed as an young manager and as of 2010 has [[List_of_Manchester_City_F.C._managers#Managers|the highest win percentage of any City manager in history]].

=== Bert Trautmann (1949-1964) ===
{{See also|Bert Trautmann}}
The club courted controversy in 1949 by signing German goalkeeper [[Bert Trautmann]] as a replacement for England international [[Frank Swift]], who had retired.&lt;ref name=&quot;hof76&quot;&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p76&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann's story with Manchester City and importantly the English supporters was soon inscribed in English football folklore and it is hard to think of a footballer who has been on such a life journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;indebert&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Bert Trautmann: In a league of his own |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/bert-trautmann-in-a-league-of-his-own-1972890.html |publisher=independent.co.uk |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=9 September 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously being a [[Nazi]] [[paratrooper]] Trautmann admitted during and prior the war he saw the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Jews]] as enemies, however it was when he taken as a prisoner of war in England that he quickly reappraised his view of both. He was astonished at his treatment as a POW, after being invited for Christmas dinner, an unthinkable luxury in an brainwashing, dictatorial [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indebert&quot;/&gt; Trautmann soon warmed to England that he decided to settle in the country upon repatriation in [[Lancashire]] and even changed his name from the hard to pronounce ''Bernhard'' to a more English ''Bert''. Having taken an interest in sport, he soon played for [[St Helens Town A.F.C.|St Helens Town]] and humbled when Manchester City signed him in 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;bert&quot;/&gt; 

The signing sparked protests; 20,000 people attended a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingle|first=Sean|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/worldcup06/2006/06/07/england_really_can_go_all_the.html |title='England really can go all the way' |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2008-08-17 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore there was pressure on Trautmann himself as he had to replace [[Frank Swift]], still regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time&lt;ref name=&quot;swime&quot;/&gt; as well as one of the most popular with his genial, gentlemanly manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;bert&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Bert Trautmann |url=http://www.football-england.com/bert_trautmann.html |publisher=Football-England |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gained support from a Jewish rabbi who said &quot;''not only one man can be convicted representative for one country''&quot; and Trautmann should no be prejudged.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcibert&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Bernd Carl &quot;Bert&quot; Trautmann OBE |url=http://mcivta.com/players/old/trautmann.html |publisher=mcivta.com |accessdate=9 September 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remarkably his dissenters soon changed their tone with his stellar performances, in an often struggling Manchester City when he first joined.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcibert&quot;/&gt; His bravery to claim a loose ball often at the peril of an oncoming opponent at full speed was admired by many supporters, not only City supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bert Trautmann: from Nazi paratrooper to hero of Manchester City |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/apr/11/bert-trautmann-nazis-manchester-city |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=11 April 2010 |accessdate=9 September 2010 |location=London |first=Louise |last=Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was this technique that gave him a broken neck in the [[1956 FA Cup Final]] and had to play the last 15 minutes as no substitutes were left. Regardless of this event, Trautmann was already seen as a hugely popular figure in English football and by the end of career with City he was lauded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time with 47,000 people attending his testimonial,&lt;ref&gt;James, ''The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame'', p142&lt;/ref&gt; with estimates at closer to 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A life less ordinary |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=344190&amp;cc=5739 |publisher=ESPN |date=28 September 2005 |accessdate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trautmann still revealed his love for City and England in 2010, &quot;''I watch all City's games on TV, they're still my club. I love England too and still shout for them - even if they're playing Germany.''&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester City legend Bert Trautmann |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2926741/Manchester-City-legend-Bert-Trautmann-Todays-Premiership-stars-couldnt-care-less.html |publisher=thesun.co.uk |date=10 April 2010 |accessdate=12 September 2010 |location=London |first=Nigel |last=Blundell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as ''[[Revie Plan|the Revie Plan]]'' reached consecutive FA Cup finals for the second time in its history, and just as in the 1930s.

=== 1955 FA Cup Final ===
{{See also|1955 FA Cup Final}}
The '''1955 FA Cup Final''' was contested by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]. Newcastle won 3&amp;ndash;1, with goals from [[Jackie Milburn]] in the first minute (after 45 seconds, a record in a final at Wembley, a record he held until [[1997 FA Cup Final|1997]]), [[Bobby Mitchell (footballer)|Bobby Mitchell]] and [[George Hannah (footballer born 1928)|George Hannah]]. [[Bobby Johnstone]] scored City's goal. The game was virtually decided when Man City fullback Meadows was turned inside out by the elusive and mercurial Bobby Mitchell and after 22 minutes was stretchered off with a bad leg injury and City were down to 10 men as no substitutes were permitted in the 1950s. Whilst City's much-vaunted ''[[Revie Plan]]'' (based on a deep-lying centre-forward in Don Revie) failed to fire.

=== 1956 FA Cup Final ===
{{See also|1956 FA Cup Final}}
The 1956 final, in which Manchester City beat [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] 3-1, is one of the most famous finals of all-time, and is remembered for City goalkeeper [[Bert Trautmann]] continuing to play after breaking his neck.

Both teams employed the formation typical of the era: two [[defender (association football)#Full back|full-backs]], a [[defender (association football)#Centre back|centre-half]], two [[wing half|wing-halves]], two [[outside forward|outside-forwards]], two [[inside forward|inside-forwards]] and a [[Forward (association football)|centre-forward]]. However, their tactical approaches differed. Birmingham, described by ''[[The Times]]'' as using &quot;iron determination, powerful tackling and open direct methods&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=F.A. Cup Clash of Styles |work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=6 March 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; employed the traditional English approach of getting the ball to the outside-forwards as quickly as possible, whereas Manchester City adopted tactics inspired by the [[Magical Magyars|Hungarian team]] which had [[England v Hungary (1953)|soundly beaten England at Wembley]] three years before. The system involved using [[Don Revie]] in a deeper position than a traditional centre-forward in order to draw a defender out of position, and was therefore known as the &quot;[[Revie Plan]]&quot;. As both teams' first-choice colours were blue, each team wore their change strip to prevent confusion. Manchester City therefore wore maroon, and Birmingham City wore white.

[[File:Wem.jpg|thumb|right|300px|City reached the FA Cup Final at Wembley in consecutive years in 1955 and 1956 - the second time they have done so in their history]]

Birmingham won [[coin flipping|the toss]] and Manchester City kicked off.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEN5may&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=What a start! Hayes Cup goal&amp;nbsp;â City 2-minute lead |work=[[Manchester Evening News]] |page=1 |date=5 May 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Birmingham goal came under pressure almost immediately. Within a minute a far post cross from [[Roy Clarke (footballer)|Roy Clarke]] narrowly eluded Hayes. Two [[corner kick|corners]] followed, the second resulting in a shot by Roy Paul.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEN5may&quot;/&gt; The next attack, in the third minute, resulted in the opening goal. Revie began the move, exchanging passes with Clarke, and back-heeling for the unmarked Hayes to sweep the ball past [[Gil Merrick]] to put Manchester City ahead. Birmingham's confidence was shaken, resulting in a series of Manchester City corners and a chance for Hayes,&lt;ref name=&quot;James122&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester City&amp;nbsp;â The Complete Record |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2006 |isbn= 1-85983-512-0|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they fought back to equalise in the 15th&amp;nbsp;minute. Astall slipped the ball to Brown, who helped it forward. It rebounded off a Manchester City defender into the path of [[Wales national football team|Welsh international]] insideâforward [[Noel Kinsey]], who fired home via Trautmann's far post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |title=Birmingham soon behind but Kinsey quick to equalise |page=1,&amp;nbsp;Final edition |date=5 May 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the remainder of the first half Birmingham had most of the play, exerting pressure on Manchester City full-back Leivers, but were unable to make a breakthrough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The Revie Plan |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Davies, H.D |year=1956}} Reprinted in {{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Stephen (ed.) |title=A Game of Two Halves |publisher=Mandarin |location=Derby |year=1993 |isbn=0-7493-1596-2 |pages=123â126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Birmingham put the ball in the net twice, Brown was adjudged to be [[offside (association football)|offside]] on both occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesMatchRep&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester's New Triumph: F.A. Cup Attacking Plan Succeeds |work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=7 May 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Warhurst missing and Boyd out of position and not fully fit, Birmingham's strength and balance was disrupted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to Manchester City's unconventional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manchester's New Triumph: F.A.

During the half-time interval, a row erupted between the Birmingham manager and some of his players about their fitness;&lt;ref name=&quot;Row&quot;&gt;{{cite news

With internal arguments still simmering the demoralised team simply did not perform in the second half.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Manchester City dressing room, a heated exchange took place between Barnes and Revie. Barnes had played defensively in the first half to counter the threat of [[Peter Murphy (footballer born 1922)|Peter Murphy]], but Revie urged him to play further forward.&lt;ref&gt;Wagg &amp; Barnes, ''This Simple Game'', pp.&amp;nbsp;58â59, &quot;'Where the fuck have you been, Ken?' 'You heard what [Les] McDowall said about me marking Murphy.' 'Bollocks to that, get up here and play.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, manager [[Les McDowall]] exhorted his players to keep possession and make their opponents chase the ball.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period immediately after halfâtime saw few chances, but then, after just over an hour's play, Manchester City regained their stride and suddenly went two goals ahead. A throw-in to Revie led to interplay on the right wing involving Barnes, Dyson, and Johnstone, resulting in a through-ball which put Dyson clear of the defence to score.&lt;ref name=&quot;James122&quot;/&gt; Two minutes later, Trautmann collected the ball at the end of a Birmingham attack and kicked the ball long to Dyson, over the heads of the retreating Birmingham players. Dyson flicked the ball on to [[Bobby Johnstone]], who scored Manchester City's third,&lt;ref name=&quot;T179&quot;&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;179.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first player ever to score in consecutive Wembley finals in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;James122&quot;/&gt;

With 17&amp;nbsp;minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced [[Dave Ewing]]. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at the feet of Murphy to win the ball, but in the collision Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;T179&quot;/&gt; Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No [[substitute (football)|substitute]]s were permitted, so Manchester City would have to see out the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put [[Roy Little]] in goal instead.&lt;ref&gt;Whittell, ''Manchester City Greats'', p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.&lt;ref name=&quot;T180&quot;&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;180.&lt;/ref&gt;

No further goals were scored, and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3â1 to Manchester City. As the players left the field, the crowd sang a chorus of &quot;For he's a jolly good fellow&quot; in tribute to Trautmann's bravery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies&quot;/&gt; Roy Paul led his team up the steps to the royal box to receive Manchester City's third FA Cup. Trautmann's neck continued to cause him pain, and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] commented on its crooked state as he gave Trautmann his winner's medal.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOBE&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article501385.ece |title=OBE for the German hero who stuck his neck out |work=[[The Times]] |date=1 November 2004 |author=Boyes, Roger |accessdate=2 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, an examination revealed that Trautmann had broken a bone in his neck.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio184&quot;&gt;Rowlands, ''Trautmann: The Biography'', p.&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt;
