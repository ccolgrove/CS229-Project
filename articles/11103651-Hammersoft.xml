Hazel then went to stay with Garry in [[Walford]], falling for his best friend [[Minty Peterson]], before Garry hit Minty and Hazel left Walford.

In August 2007, it was revealed that Hazel and Minty had started a relationship behind Garry's back. They took a romantic weekend in [[Brighton]] but did not know that Garry was also there with [[Dawn Swann]]. Garry found out they were seeing each other and was outraged. Back in Walford, Minty found found the engagement ring that Garry had used to propose to Dawn (she said no) and bent down to pick it up off the floor. He was on one knee, holding the ring, when Hazel came in the room. She assumed that Minty was planning to propose to her and immediately said &quot;Yes, I do&quot;. They have since been planning the wedding, and she got a job as a receptionist at Booty.

On 18 October 2007, Hazel was left devastated when Minty took what was thought to be a heart attack whilst trying to lose weight for their wedding. However, after he was checked out at the hospital it turned out that he had only pulled a muscle in his arm, which left her relieved. She then befriended [[Heather Trott]], who is infatuated with her son Garry, and has been trying to put her off him. On 25 October, Hazel then asked an elated Heather to be her bridesmaid at her upcoming wedding to Minty, to which she accepted.

On 28 January 2008, [[Shirley Carter]] went to the salon to berate Hazel because she replaced Heather as her bridesmaid with [[Dawn Swann]] so that she could increase her chances of winning the contest with a glamorous bridesmaid. During the row, Hazel fainted but Shirley caught her. She later told Minty that she was pregnant. He bought lots of things for the baby but Hazel tearfully revealed on 1 February 2008 that it was the [[menopause]], and she could never have a baby. 

Hazel left the square on 4 February 2008, after experiencing her menopause and realising that she would be restricting Minty's future desires to have a family if she stayed with him. She returned on 22 April 2008 and proposed to Minty on his wedding morning to Heather. Hazel told him that they'd get married and set for a life on the cruise ships but he said no. He then ran after Heather and proposed to her for real. Hazel watched as the wedding went ahead without her and said goodbye to Garry and left.

Hazel was last mentioned a year later on 9 February 2009 when Minty heard that Garry was going to join her to work for the cruise liner however Garry thought he should propose to Dawn again. However when that was unsuccessful for the second time, Garry was presumed dead a week later; when his car was discovered at a popular suicide spot, Dawn and Minty decided to send Garry's personal belongings to Hazel. Minty last heard that her cruise ship was heading for [[Monaco]].

Summer was born on 19 June 2007 after her mother, Dawn, went into premature labour on the tube. Dawn made it to the hospital, where she safely delivered Summer with her best friend [[Carly Wicks]] by her side. 

Dawn initially found it hard to bond with Summer as she still wanted to go out partying. However during a trip to [[Brighton]] in August 2007 with Summer and [[Garry Hobbs]], Dawn accepted responsibility for her daughter and vowed to become a proper mother. As January 2008 approached, Summer saw her mother begin a relationship with builder [[Jase Dyer]], and began modelling for catalogues after Dawn took her to an audition. 

Dawn wanted Summer to be a model and entered her for the &quot;Beautiful Baby&quot; competition at [[the Queen Vic]] on her first birthday. Dawn put fake tan on Summer for the competition, which she later had an allergic reaction to, and was named runner-up at the end of the day.   

On Summer's birthday in June 2008 [[May Wright]] returned to Walford, intent on kidnapping Summer from her family. May was married to Summer's father, Rob, when she was conceived during an affair Rob had with Dawn and May, unable to have children, had never quite gotten over it. Upon seeing Summer in fake tan, May branded Dawn a terrible mother before attacking her and her brother [[Mickey Miller|Mickey]] and then trying to make her escape with Summer, who she called Sophie. However, Mickey rescued Summer and locked May out of the bedroom, leaving May trying to break down the door, screaming &quot;Sophie&quot;. Devastated, May went down to the kitchen and committed [[suicide]] by blowing the house up. Mickey then tried to throw Summer out the window but he dropped her when he passed out and Jase caught her. Dawn then pushed Mickey out of the window but passed out, so Keith rushed into the house and rescued her. All three were taken to hospital. Summer was declared healthy once checked on by doctors.

In July 2008, it was revealed that Jase had adopted Summer seen as Dawn had left the father section of her birth certificate blank.

More tragedy struck for Summer's family when her adoptive father, Jase, was murdered by members of a gang he used to run about with, on 26 August 2008. Dawn, Summer, Jase and his son [[Jay Brown|Jay]] had been living at 89b George Street but the flat was cordoned off by police so Dawn and Summer moved in with Garry whilst Jay went into care. However, being in Walford proved too much for Dawn and at the beginning of September she and Summer went to live with their family in the [[Cotswolds]]. Dawn returned to Walford on 6 October for Jase's funeral, leaving Summer with her grandmother [[Rosie Miller|Rosie]], and was adamant that she was returning to the Cotswolds in order to build a new life there with her daughter. However, after much persuasion from Garry, Dawn decided to stay in Walford and two weeks later, mother and daughter moved in with Garry and his flatmates [[Minty Peterson]] and [[Callum Monks]].

Dawn embarked on an affair with her boss [[Phil Mitchell]], but after this was revealed to Garry he decided to give her another chance and they left Walford together sailing on a boat.

'''Damian''' was [[Roxy Slater|Roxy Mitchell]]'s fiancÃ© whom she started avoiding calls from during her stay in Walford. Roxy told her sister [[Ronnie Mitchell|Ronnie]] she was going to leave Damian and never go back to Ibiza, but Ronnie warned her to wait until she got the money out of his business. They then both got into an argument over the situation during which Damian turned up totally unexpectedly at [[The Queen Victoria]]. Later left after Roxy and Ronnie tricked him into believing Roxy's new boyfriend was Ian Beale and she was pregnant with Ian's baby and Roxy snogged Ian to prove she loved him with all her heart in front of Damian.  Damian then left to go back to Ibiza.

Two months later, he returned to Walford to be with Roxy, who was then found crying on the bed pretending she had a miscarriage. Ronnie was horrified that Roxy was setting him up. Roxy tried not to let him know that she was using him only for the money to help Peggy pay off her Â£40,000 debts and the funds for her and Ronnie's future ownership of the [[R&amp;R (EastEnders)|Scarlet]] nightclub. On 29 October, Damian attacked Ian in the cafe when he discovered that he and Roxy were never even in love, and then got himself arrested by [[Jack Branning]] when he 'hit' Ronnie (this was set up by Ronnie, when she made him look like he was sexually assaulting her). Damian also realised what the Mitchell sisters were up to when he then realised that Roxy doesn't really love him, but is using him - only because he had everything.
During the arrest, Ronnie made an excuse and told Damian why he was set up - because he owed her money, so he accepted her offer and then was taken in Jack's car. This was the very last time we ever saw of him.

'''Queenie Trott''' is the mother of [[Heather Trott]]. Queenie is a controlling woman, who prefers Heather to be at her beck and call. She regularly taunts, insults and demeans her daughter, always calling her by the name &quot;Pig&quot;, but she does not react kindly to those who might want to lure her away. When [[Shirley Carter]] asked Heather to move out of her mother's flat and into hers, Queenie manipulated Heather into staying. Queenie claimed she was pleased to see her daughter leave, but then pretended to have an accident and Heather was so concerned for her mother's safety that she decided not to move out. However, Heather later heard Queenie laughing about her deception to a friend on the phone, mocking her daughter's stupidity, calling her a &quot;stupid cow.&quot; Heather was so angry that she decided to move in with Shirley after all, only to find that Shirley had been evicted as she'd failed to pay the rent. Not wanting to remain living with her spiteful mother, Heather decided to pay the rent with money she had in her savings account. She sneaked back to Queenie's to find her savings book, but discovered that her mother had stolen most of her money.

She turned up on Heather's doorstep on 16 March 2008 to meet Heather's new fiancÃ©, [[Minty Peterson]]. She blackmailed Minty and Heather, saying she would not leave unless they gave her their winnings from the wedding competition they were in. Heather revealed to Minty that Queenie had told her that her father walked out on them because he hated living with Heather. Minty then encouraged Heather to stand up to Queenie, which she did, prompting Queenie to leave.

Queenie later tried to stop Minty and Heather's wedding, revealing Heather's true identity to [[List of EastEnders characters (2008)#Marni Merrick|Marni]] from the magazine. Heather married Minty and later berated Queenie for trying to ruin her happiness, and Queenie left.
&lt;br clear=all&gt;

Queenie was mentioned in December 2008 when Heather stated that she wasn't surprised when Queenie hadn't sent her a Christmas card, and again in February 2009 when Heather assumed that she was at [[George Michael]]'s house and reminded herself of her school days, being a fan of George, with Queenie bringing her down of her happiness.

Queenie is mentioned in October 2009, when Heather gave birth to a baby boy whom she named George, after George Michael. Heather phoned Queenie to let her know that she is a grandmother, but was unsurprisingly let down after she took low opinions of the birth. In 2011, Heather tries to visit Queenie but a neighbour tells her that Queenie moved to [[Eastbourne]] a few years ago, and that she wasn't worth Heather's time looking for her.

'''Terry Bates''' was the leader of a [[football hooliganism|football firm]], including [[#Bird Meadows|Bird Meadows]], Dee, and formerly [[Jase Dyer]]. Jase had arrived in [[London]] from [[Manchester]] aged 15, and Terry took him under his wing. After Dee told the police about Jase's unruly behaviour, Jase went to [[prison]] and came out a changed man, caring for his son [[Jay Brown|Jay]]. In October 2007, Terry sent Bird to find Jase in [[Walford]], and Jase met the gang at a pub. The gang later turned on Dee when they found out he had told the police about Jase, and arranged for his car to crash, injuring him severely. Jase expressed his wish to have no part in the gang, so Terry visited Jay while Jase was out, taking him to see a firework display. 

Jase later found Terry in a [[snooker]] [[pool hall|hall]], and again said that he wanted no further involvement with the gang. After playing a game of snooker with Jase, Terry let him go home, watching him menacingly as he left.

Later, Terry decided to storm the Vic with a large group of hitmen, believing Jase was there on a date with [[Dawn Swann]]. Not finding him, Terry's gang smashed the place up, and attacked [[Roxy Mitchell]], [[Ronnie Mitchell]], [[Keith Miller (EastEnders)|Keith Miller]], [[Mickey Miller]], [[Darren Miller]], [[Garry Hobbs]] and [[Patrick Trueman]]. He confronted Jase in the cellar and one of his gang members attacked Jase, knocking a pregnant [[Honey Mitchell]] down into some empty beer kegs,  (who was then rushed to hospital by Jase). Terry later left the area with his gang members.

Terry turned up at the hospital, then later visited Jase's flat and turned Jay against Jase. After an encounter with Jase and [[Phil Mitchell]] lying about [[William Mitchell (EastEnders)|William Mitchell]]'s 'death', Terry and Bird were arrested. 

He returned to Walford on 25 July 2008, after Jase, desperate for money, agreed to work for him again. Terry reappeared in August, where he made plans for Jase to get some of his money back for him. It turned out that Jase has been stealing from him, and Terry, in retaliation, set Jase up, then returned to his flat and held Jay hostage. Jase and [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] rushed to the rescue. A confrontation ensued where Billy managed to get Jay out of the flat to safety in Jase's van. Terry had his men beat Jase to the brink of death. After Jay made a frantic call to Honey, armed [[CO19]] officers stormed 89 George Street and arrested Terry, his men and Billy, who had been hiding in the bathroom after seeing the gang standing over Jase and was too frightened to try to save him. Jase later died in hospital.

Terry returned in May 2009 during his trial. He got his wife [[Viv Bates]] to threaten Billy saying she will hurt Jay if he does go to the trial to testify. When his name is still on the witness list, Viv sent Bird and two other hitmen to hold Jay hostage. However, Terry was found guilty of Jase's murder so Viv left him, throwing her wedding ring at him. He then said he would have revenge on her.

'''William Mitchell''', played by Toby Warpole, is the son of [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy]] ([[Perry Fenwick]]) and [[Honey Mitchell]] ([[Emma Barton]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.walfordweb.co.uk/walfordweb/articles-hqimage.php?id=1118 Honey and William Mitchell]&quot;, ''Walford Web'', URL last accessed 16 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2007, Honey finds out she is pregnant again and tells [[Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]), but asks her not to tell Billy. Pat persuades Honey to tell him, but he is distant initially. He soon comes round, following a heart to heart, and admits to being concerned, like Honey, that they would love the new baby more than Janet if it did not have [[Down's Syndrome]], which Janet has. Honey reassures him it will not happen. After this, the two agree they want the baby and gradually tell their family. On the due date, Honey is knocked over during an incident at [[The Queen Victoria]] involving [[Jase Dyer]] ([[Stephen Lord]]), [[Terry Bates]] ([[Nicholas Ball (actor)|Nicholas Ball]]) and Terry's gang, and she goes into labour. When the baby is born, it seems that he is stillborn because he is not breathing but he pulls through. Honey wants to name him after his father and feels guilty about being happy that he does not have Down's syndrome.

William leaves Walford with Honey and Janet on 2 September 2008 when Billy lies about giving Jase's money to charity, which led to his death. It is revealed a few days later that they are living with William's grandfather [[Jack Edwards (EastEnders)|Jack Edwards]] ([[Nicky Henson]]). On 18 September 2008, Janet and William return when [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) wants a family photo taken. On 25 December 2008, he and Janet return again for Christmas but are not seen on-screen. In April 2009, when it is revealed that William is ill, Billy goes to see him, leaving his family, who are torn apart by the true identity of [[Danielle Jones (EastEnders)|Danielle Jones]] ([[Lauren Crace]]) and her subsequent death, to see William. William reappears the following month, along with Janet, for Billy's 50th birthday party. In May 2010, Billy has trouble telling William and Janet that Honey has been involved in a car crash and that Jack has died. He appears in May 2011 when he meets Billy's girlfriend [[Julie Perkins]] ([[Cathy Murphy]]) for the first time as they play in the local park. In June, he visits Billy on Father's Day, and in July, William and Janet meet their niece [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]) for the first time.

===Reception===
The scenes in which Honey was attacked were subject to heavy criticism, with [[Ofcom]] receiving 78 complaints from viewers about the level of violence displayed, and concerns for the safety of her baby.
