'''Arc''' is a [[dialect (computing)|dialect]] of the [[Lisp programming language]] now under development by [[Paul Graham (computer programmer)|Paul Graham]] and [[Robert Tappan Morris|Robert Morris]].

== History ==

In 2001 Paul Graham announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulgraham.com/arcll1.html Arc at 3 Weeks (Paul Graham)]&lt;/ref&gt; that he was working on a new dialect of Lisp named &quot;Arc&quot;. Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the language, and some internal projects at [[Y Combinator]] have been written in Arc, most notably the [[Hacker News]] web forum and news aggregator program.

In the essay Being Popular&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html Essay:Being Popular]&lt;/ref&gt; Graham describes a few of his goals for the language. Among the claimed design goals are that &quot;Arc should be hackable&quot; and &quot;there should be good [[Library (computing)|libraries]]&quot;; Graham also proposes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be far from the truth to say that a hacker about to write a program decides what language to use, at least subconsciously, based on the total number of characters he'll have to type. If this isn't precisely how hackers think, a language designer would do well to act as if it were.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Paul Graham suggests [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]]'s original [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] to have been built wholly on a small set of &quot;axioms&quot;, and maintains that Arc ought to be constructed in a similar way, even when that means the language may not have features that large organizations want.  Specifically, Graham feels that object-orientation is not useful as OO methods and patterns are just &quot;good design,&quot; and he sees the language features used to implement OO as partially mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulgraham.com/noop.html Why Arc Isn't Especially Object-Oriented]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulgraham.com/arcfaq.html Arc FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy among Lisp programmers is if, and how much, the [[S-expressions]] of the language should be complemented by other forms of [[syntax]]. Graham feels that additional syntax should be used in situations where pure S-expressions would be overly verbose, saying, &quot;I don't think we should be religiously opposed to introducing syntax into Lisp.&quot; Graham also feels that efficiency problems should be solved by giving the programmer a good [[Performance analysis|profiler]].



== Examples ==

[[Hello world]] in Arc :
&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
 (prn &quot;Hello, World&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

A program used by Paul Graham to illustrate Arc's terseness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulgraham.com/arcchallenge.html Take the Arc challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;
It produces at the url &quot;/said&quot; a form with one field. When the form is submitted, it leads to a page with a link that says &quot;click here&quot;, which itself leads to a page with the value of the original input field.

&lt;source lang=&quot;lisp&quot;&gt;
(defop said req
  (aform [onlink &quot;click here&quot; (pr &quot;you said: &quot; (arg _ &quot;foo&quot;))]
    (input &quot;foo&quot;) 
    (submit)))
&lt;/source&gt;

==Versions==
===Official version===
The first publicly released version of Arc was made available on 29 January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://paulgraham.com/arc0.html Arc's Out (29 January 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; implemented on top of [[Racket_(programming_language)|Racket]] (&quot;MzScheme&quot; at that time).  The release comes in the form of a .tar archive, containing the Racket source code for Arc.  A tutorial&lt;ref&gt;[http://ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt tutorial]&lt;/ref&gt; and a discussion forum&lt;ref&gt;[http://arclanguage.org/forum discussion forum]&lt;/ref&gt; are also available.  
The forum uses the same program that [[Hacker_News|news.ycombinator.com]], and is itself written in Arc.

=== Unofficial versions ===
Due to the slow development of the official Arc branch, some members of the Arc community started unofficial repositories with unofficial emendations, extensions and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://github.com/nex3/arc/tree/master arc3 Repository on Github]&lt;/ref&gt;  One version, '''Anarki''', was started to continue development after some members of the community came to feel that the development of Arc centralized under Paul Graham had become stagnant.

'''Rainbow'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/conanite/rainbow Rainbow, an implementation of Arc in java by Conan Dalton]&lt;/ref&gt; is an implementation of Arc in [[Java (programming language)|java]]
