==Early years==

==Career==
Ross is one of the early practitioners of a singing style known as [[vocalese]], which involves the setting of original lyrics to an instrumental jazz solo. Her 1952 treatment of saxophonist [[Wardell Gray]]'s &quot;Twisted&quot; is a classic example of vocalese.&lt;ref name=&quot;am&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Annie Ross  biography|first=John|last=Bush|publisher=Allmusic|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=annie-ross-p7455/biography|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Twisted&quot; has been recorded by [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Maria Friedman]], and many others. Her first album, ''Singin' and Swingin' '' (1952,) was recorded in New York with members of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]. Other albums include ''Annie By Candlelight'' (1956), ''Sings A Song With Mulligan'' (1958) with baritone saxophonist [[Gerry Mulligan]] and [[Chet Baker]] on trumpet, ''A Gasser!'' (1959) with [[Zoot Sims]], ''In Hoagland'' (1981) with [[Georgie Fame]] and [[Hoagy Carmichael]], and ''Music Is Forever'' (1995) featuring [[Tommy Flanagan]] on piano.

In February 1956, the [[United Kingdom|British]] music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported that Ross's song &quot;I Want You to be My Baby&quot; was [[List of songs banned by the BBC|banned]] by the [[BBC]], due to the [[lyric]] &quot;Come upstairs and have some loving&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NME Rock 'N' Roll Years&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Tobler|year=1992|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|edition=1st|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd|location=London|page=23|id=CN 5585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She recorded seven albums with [[Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross]] between 1957 and 1962. Their first, ''[[Sing a Song of Basie]]'' (1957), was to have been performed by a group of singers hired by [[Jon Hendricks]] and [[Dave Lambert]] with Ross brought in only as vocal consultant. When the first two tracks were recorded and deemed unsatisfactory, it was decided that the trio should attempt recording the material and [[overdub]] all the additional vocals themselves.  The resulting album was a success, and the trio became an international hit. Over the next five years, [[Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross]] toured all over the world and recorded such albums as ''[[Lambert, Hendricks, &amp; Ross!]]'' (aka ''The Hottest New Group In Jazz'', 1959), ''Sing Ellington'' (1960), ''High Flying'' (1962), and ''[[The Real Ambassadors]]'' (1962), written by [[Dave Brubeck]] and featuring [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Carmen McRae]].

Ross left the group in 1962&lt;ref name=&quot;am&quot; /&gt; and, in 1964, opened her own [[nightclub]] in London. '''Annie's Room''' featured performances by [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]], [[Stuff Smith]], [[Blossom Dearie]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Jon Hendricks]], and [[Erroll Garner]], as well as Ross herself. A [[compilation album]] of Ross' 1965 performances from Annie's Room was released on [[Compact disc|CD]] in 2006.

Ross has appeared in a number of films. As a child, she sang &quot;Loch Lomond&quot; in ''[[Our Gang Follies of 1938]]'', and later played [[Judy Garland]]'s sister in ''[[Presenting Lily Mars]]'' (1943). Other notable roles include Vera Webster in ''[[Superman III]]'' (1983), Mrs. Hazeltine in ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'' (1987), Loretta Cresswood in ''[[Pump Up the Volume (film)|Pump Up the Volume]]'' (1990), Lydia in ''[[Blue Sky (film)|Blue Sky]]'' (1994), and most notably as Tess Trainer in [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993). 

She provided the speaking voice for [[Britt Ekland]] in ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'' (1973). On stage, Ross appeared in ''Cranks'' (1955) in both London and [[New York City|New York]], ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (1972) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], ''The Seven Deadly Sins'' at [[The Royal Opera House]], ''Kennedy's Children'' (1975) at Arts Theatre, London, ''[[Side By Side By Sondheim]]'', and in the [[Joe Papp]] production of ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1982) with [[Tim Curry]].

In the early 1990s, Ross starred in the [[horror film]]s ''[[Basket Case 2]]'' and ''[[Basket Case 3: The Progeny]]''.

She has received numerous awards and honors including the [[ASCAP]] Jazz Wall Of Fame (2009), the prestigious [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] Jazz Masters Award (2010), and the MAC Award for Lifetime Achievement (2011). She performs regularly at The Metropolitan Room (34 W. 22nd Street) in New York, with Tardo Hammer on piano, Neal Miner on bass, Tony Jefferson on drums, and [[Warren Vache]] on trumpet.
