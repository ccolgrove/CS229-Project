'''Gammu''' is a project which encompasses applications, scripts and drivers for managing various functions on cellular phones and similar devices.

It is a stable{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and mature codebase with support for many models available on the market and provides functions unavailable in other similar projects. Long term development is oriented towards making a shared [[Application programming interface|API]] for classes of device rather than supporting single phone models (which are eventually made obsolete with the arrival of new models).

Gammu itself works in command line or as a daemon, but there exists [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] written in [[wxPython]] called [[Wammu]].

==Features==

* Use to activate [[Nokia network monitor]]
* Supports sending [[SMS]] (with delivery report), picture messages, can send/receive ring tones (as SMS)
* [[Phonebook]]
* Dial/Receive calls
* Calendar
* Todo list
* Notes
* File system manipulations

Can connect using serial/[[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cables, [[infrared]] and [[Bluetooth]].

== Supported phones ==

* Many Nokia models.
* Alcatel BE5 (501/701), BF5 (715), BH4 (535/735).
* AT capable phones (Samsung, Siemens, Nokia, Alcatel, Motorola, Sony-Ericssson, IPAQ).
* [[OBEX]] and IrMC capable phones (Sony-Ericsson, Motorola).
* Symbian phones through gnapplet.

== History==

This project has originally forked from [[Gnokii]] and up to version 0.58 has been named MyGnokii2. Then need for better name arrived and Gammu was chosen as an acronym for GNU All Mobile Management Utilities, without knowing that Gammu from &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot; written by Frank Herbert exists.

Current project leader is [[Michal ÄihaÅ]].
