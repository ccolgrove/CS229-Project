{{Capitalism}}
Proto-capitalist economies and [[free market]]s were active during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution]], where an early [[market economy]] and form of [[merchant capitalism]] took root between the 8thâ12th centuries.

A vigorous [[monetary economy]] was based on a widely-circulated [[currency]] (the [[dinar]]) and the integration of [[monetary]] areas that were previously independent.

[[Organization]]al [[Business|enterprises]] independent from the [[State (polity)|state]] also existed in the medieval Islamic world, while the [[Agency (law)|agency]] institution was also introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Said Amir Arjomand (1999), &quot;The Law, Agency, and Policy in Medieval Islamic Society: Development of the Institutions of Learning from the Tenth to the Fifteenth Century&quot;, ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' '''41''', pp. 263â93.

Many of these early capitalist concepts were adopted and further advanced in [[medieval Europe]] from the 13th century onwards.&lt;ref name=Banaji&gt;{{cite journal | last=Banaji | first=Jairus | journal=[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]] | year=2007 | volume=15 | issue=1 | pages=47-74, 28p |DOI = 10.1163/156920607X171591 | publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
