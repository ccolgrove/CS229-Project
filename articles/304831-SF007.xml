While there is no general agreement upon the greatest [[film]], many publications and organizations have tried to determine the '''films considered the best'''. The films mentioned in this article have all been mentioned in a notable [[Statistical survey|survey]] â be it a popular [[Opinion poll|poll]] or [[Film criticism|critics']] poll. Many of these sources focus on [[Cinema of the United States|American films]] or were polls of [[English language|English-speaking]] film goers, but those considered the greatest within their respective countries are also included here.

None of these citations should be viewed as scientific measures of the film-watching world. They are often influenced by [[vote stacking]] or they survey a population with skewed [[demographics]]. [[Internet]]-based surveys have a self-selecting audience of unknown participants. The methodology of some surveys may be questionable. Sometimes (as in the case of the [[American Film Institute]]) voters were asked to select films from a limited list of entries.

==Polls of critics and filmmakers==
{{Globalize|date=August 2010}}
* Every decade, the British film monthly ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' asks an international group of film professionals to vote for their greatest film of all time. The ''Sight &amp; Sound'' accolade has come to be regarded as one of the most important of the &quot;greatest ever film&quot; lists. [[Roger Ebert]] described it as &quot;by far the most respected of the countless polls of great movies--the only one most serious movie people take seriously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='Citizen Kane' fave film of movie elite | publisher=rogerebert.com | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020811/COMMENTARY/88010305|accessdate=2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first poll, in 1952, was topped by ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948).&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;S&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/polls/topten/|title=Sight &amp; Sound - Top ten|accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) has been voted number one in each of the last five ''Sight &amp; Sound'' polls. A separate poll of established film directors, held for the first time in 1992, has also placed ''Citizen Kane'' at the top.&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;S&quot; /&gt; The film was selected as number one in a ''[[Village Voice]]'' and in a ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]'' critics' poll. It was listed as the greatest American film by the [[American Film Institute]] in both the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|first (1998)]] and [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|second (2007)]] versions of its ''100 Years... 100 Movies'' list.
* ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' (1956) is the film most often mentioned in a poll of the favorite films of directors by German language ''Steadycam'' magazine in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinepad.com/awards/lieblingsfilme.htm |title=Lieblings Filme |publisher=Cinepad.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Tokyo Story]]'' (1953) by [[YasujirÅ Ozu]] topped a critics' poll conducted by Asian film magazine ''[[Cinemaya]]'' in 1998. It was followed by [[Satyajit Ray]]'s ''[[Pather Panchali]]'' (1955) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) tied at second place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; of Canons|first=Donato|last=Totaro|journal=Offscreen Journal|publisher=[[Canada Council|Canada Council for the Arts]]|date=January 31, 2003|url=http://www.horschamp.qc.ca/new_offscreen/canon.html|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Rules of the Game|La RÃ¨gle du Jeu (The Rules of the Game)]]'' (1939) by director [[Jean Renoir]] was named the greatest film by the French film magazine ''[[Positif (magazine)|Positif]]'' in 1991.&lt;ref name=Lists&gt;{{cite web|title=Lists|publisher=Film Journey|url=http://filmjourney.weblogger.com/lists|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds the second slot in the ''Village Voice'' poll,&lt;ref name=villagevoice/&gt; and is one of only two movies to have appeared in every one of the ''Sight &amp; Sound'' polls, the other being ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/critics.html Critics' Top Ten Poll,] ''Sight and Sound'', BFI site&lt;/ref&gt;
