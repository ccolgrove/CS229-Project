The Graduate Department of Computer Science offers a PhD in computer science. In addition it offers Master of Science degrees in computer science, information systems (in conjunction with the Stern School of Business), and in scientific computing. For the PhD program, every PhD computer science student must receive a grade of A or A- on the final examination for algorithms, systems, applications, and a PhD-level course chosen by the student that does not satisfy the first three requirements, such as cryptography and numerical methods. Students may take the final exam for any these courses without being enrolled in the course.

The Computer Science Masters program offers instruction in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work in the computer industry or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree are in a position to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and computational finance. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/graduate/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Graduate Programs in Computer Science |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Courant PhD students are fully funded and are paid with a 9-month stipend. Doctoral students take advanced courses in their areas of specialization, followed by a period of research and the preparation and defense of the doctoral thesis. Courant Students in Ph.D. programs may earn a master's degree while in progress toward the Ph.D program. Areas where there are special funding opportunities for graduate students include: Mathematics, Mechanics, and Material Sciences, Number Theory, Probability, and Scientific Computing. All PhD candidates are required to take a written comprehensive examination, oral preliminary examination, and create a dissertation defense. Each supported doctoral student has access to his or her own dedicated Unix workstation.

Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora_(software)]] social network.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

The undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&amp;sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, two minors (one in computer science, and one in web programming and applications) and a joint minor in computer science/mathematics. The BA degree can also be pursued with honors. Students may combine the degree with other majors within the College of Arts and Science to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with [[NYU-Poly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minor in computer science is designed primarily for mathematics and science majors whose work will require basic programming skills. The minor in web programming and applications is designed for humanities and social sciences students who plan to use computer application software such as spreadsheets, desktop publishing, multimedia, and Internet software extensively in their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/minors |title=NYU Computer Science Department &gt; Computer Science Minors |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graduation ===
The Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers while undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.

It is a one-day festival of classes in the mathematical and computer sciences, designed and taught by graduate and undergraduate students, faculty, and others associated with the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~csplash/index.php |title=Courant Splash! - cSplash |publisher=Cims.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extracurricular activities ===
There are many clubs within the Courant Institute open to undergraduate and graduate students alike. These clubs include the Courant Student Organization, The ACM at NYU, Women-in-Computing (WinC), The Mathematics Society, Masters Association for Computer Science and many more. Additionally, CIMS sponsors and holds seminars and colloquiums almost daily on weekdays on topics of interest, in which some of whom may be held outside of Warren Weaver Hall. Many speakers of these seminars and colloquiums are experienced researchers from corporations from a variety of industries and researchers from private and government research laboratories, top universities, and NYU. Every academic year, CIMS holds award ceremonies, showcases, and parties to celebrate their faculty and undergraduate and graduate students and keep the academic atmosphere fun and enjoyable at CIMS. One such example is the NYU Computer Science Department Showcase held every semester to showcase projects that have been completed in various computer science graduate and undergraduate courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cims.nyu.edu/events/ |title=NYU &gt; Courant Institute &gt; Weekly Bulletin |publisher=Cims.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~wincweb/winc.html |title=New York University - Women in Computing |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~csstu/ |title=Courant Student Organization:: New York University |publisher=Cims.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/math_club/index.html |title=NYU Mathematics Society: Home |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2010-04-24 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/~acmweb/wordpress/ |title=The ACM at NYU |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1934, [[Richard Courant]] left [[GÃ¶ttingen University]] in Germany to become a visiting professor at NYU. He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed &quot;Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics&quot;. Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor Harold Grad in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the third produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].
