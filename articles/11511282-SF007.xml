'''YouPorn''' is a free [[pornographic]] [[video hosting service|video sharing]] website. Since starting in August 2006, it has become the most popular [[internet pornography|pornographic website]]. In November 2007, it was reported to be the largest free pornographic website on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Special Report with Brit Hume]].&quot; Broadcast: November 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2011 it was the 83rd most popular website overall as of May 2011 (It has since been overcome by xvideos.com as of July 8th, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mostpopularwebsites.net/ |title=Most Popular Websites on the Internet |publisher=Mostpopularwebsites.net |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This [[Web 2.0]] (or [[Porn 2.0]]) site differs from many other pornographic websites in that it is completely free and ad-supported. One journalist reported that in May 2007 it generated a monthly ad revenue of $120,000 and that it was owned by Stephen Paul Jones.&lt;ref name=portfolio&gt;[http://www.portfolio.com/culture-lifestyle/culture-inc/arts/2007/10/15/YouPorn-Vivid-Entertainment-Profile Obscene Losses], ''[[CondÃ© Nast Portfolio|Portfolio]]'', 15 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The [[domain name]] was registered by a company in December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.t-online.de/BTO/news/aktuell/2006/11/14/private-s__exfilme/private-s__ex-filme.html Warum zeigen immer mehr Menschen ihre privaten Sexfilme im Internet?], ''Bild.de'', 14 November 2006. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youporn site reports that the owner is Midstream Media International N.V. seated in [[Willemstad]] which is the [[capital city]] of [[CuraÃ§ao]], an [[island]] in the southern [[Caribbean Sea]] that forms a [[constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xbiz.com/news/128103 YouPorn.com Hit With 'History-Sniffing' Lawsuit], ''[[XBIZ]]'', December 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Sunny Freeman, a reporter pursuing a graduate degree in journalism at UBC, wrote one article in The Tyee calling the company &quot;German-based&quot;.&lt;ref name=tyee&gt;[http://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2007/07/06/Porn2-0/ Porn 2.0, and Its Victims], ''[[The Tyee]]'', 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The site is run from a hosting service in Texas. The terms of service document explicitly refers to California law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youporn.com/terms YouPorn Terms of Service], created 20 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
[[File:Youporn-graph.png|thumb|right|220px|Graph of youporn.com access by [[alexa.com]]]]

[[PornoTube]], an earlier pornographic video sharing site that debuted in July 2006 and generated some publicity, has since been overtaken in popularity by YouPorn,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=youporn.com&amp;site1=pornotube.com&amp;site2=&amp;site3=&amp;site4=&amp;y=t&amp;z=3&amp;h=300&amp;w=610&amp;range=3y&amp;size=Medium&amp;url=youporn.com Comparison of YouPorn and PornoTube traffic] Alexa.com&lt;/ref&gt; which debuted in August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=youporn.com |title=Alexa traffic details for youporn.com |publisher=Alexa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2007, YouPorn was the highest-ranked adult website according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]], ranging in the top 35 globally visited sites. In the same year the site was adding 15 million new users each month.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/dec/16/film.usa &quot;Home porn gives industry the blues&quot;], guardian.co.uk, 16 December 2007. Retrieved 04 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other websites now use a similar concept; some serve only videos in a specific category. Several other sites collect and index links to the videos hosted on these sites. Some of the main rivals of YouPorn are [[Xtube]], [[Redtube]], [[Pornhub]] etc.  

[[Porn 2.0]] sites such as these are seen as posing notable competition for paid pornographic websites and traditional magazine and DVD-based pornography.&lt;ref name=portfolio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/industry/2007-06-05-internet-porn_N.htm Purveyors of porn scramble to keep up with Internet], ''USA Today'', 5 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/chris_ayres/article1951164.ece YouTube with fewer clothes], ''The Times'', 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and praise==
{{Criticism section|date=October 2010}}

YouPorn consumes more than three [[terabyte]]s of bandwidth each day, which has caused the site to go down at times due to the sheer volume of users and the large file size of the videos. When the online version of a German newspaper reported on YouPorn in November 2006, the site could not deal with the traffic surge, went down temporarily, and asked its users for an unmetered service provider in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://notes.computernotizen.de/2006/11/15/bildde-verursacht-pornowelle/ Bild.de verursacht Pornowelle], 15 November 2006. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have also surfaced over the inability to verify the age of the persons depicted in the videos, the possibility of [[copyright]]ed videos being uploaded to the site, and the possibility of privacy violations when private sex tapes are uploaded without the consent of all involved parties.&lt;ref name=tyee/&gt; In 2007 [[Vivid Entertainment]] took legal action against YouPorn, claiming that the streaming of copyrighted material was depriving it of revenue.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

YouPorn has been called &quot;a good role model for the sexually naive&quot;, as many of its homemade videos depict amateur couples having ordinary sex (known as &quot;Amateur&quot;), as opposed to the often unreal scenarios of commercial porn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/caitlin_moran/article2509148.ece?openComment=true A good role model for the sexually naive], ''[[The Times]]'', 24 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Court papers filed by Class Action Lawyers, Fears | Nachawati Law Firm, in the Central District of California show that that on December 6, 2010 two men have filed a class action lawsuit against Netherlands-based Midstream Media N.V., owners of YouPorn claiming the companyâs sites use âhistory-sniffingâ technology to hijack usersâ personal information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xbiz.com/news/128103 YouPorn.com Hit With 'History-Sniffing' Lawsuit], ''[[XBIZ]]'', December 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blocking==
===Germany===
German law does not allow hardcore pornography without an effective age verification system, and the German [[BundesprÃ¼fstelle fÃ¼r jugendgefÃ¤hrdende Medien]]'' (Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons)'' placed YouPorn on its index. As a result, since April 2007, the German site of the [[Google]] search engine (&lt;code&gt;google.de&lt;/code&gt;) classified YouPorn.com as a hardcore pornography website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=youporn&amp;btnG=Suche&amp;meta= Search results for &quot;youporn&quot; on google.de] delivering many comments from blogs&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced it with a link to [[Chilling Effects (group)|Chilling Effects]], claiming that a &quot;German regulatory body reported illegal material&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chillingeffects.org/notice.cgi?sID=815 |title=German regulatory body reported illegal material&amp;nbsp;â Chilling Effects Clearinghouse |publisher=Chillingeffects.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a request by a competing pornography service{{Who|date=June 2011}}, German provider [[Arcor (Telecommunications)|Arcor]] categorized YouPorn and a few other porn sites as hardcore pornographic and also blocked access to the website at the routing level in September 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/95804 Arcor blocks access to porno pages],{{dead link|date=December 2010}} ''[[Heise Online]]'', 11 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; affecting over 2 million users. The [[Pirate Party Germany|German Pirate Party]] promptly opened a [[proxy server]] so that Arcor customers could continue to easily access YouPorn.

Arcor lifted the block on September 17 because the [[IP address]]-based filter which had been set up for YouPorn also affected other sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsdsblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/arcor-sperrt-youporncom.html Arcor sperrt Youporn.com] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirchberg{{Who|date=June 2011}} then sued, alleging that Arcor aided unfair competition by YouPorn, and on 19 October 2007 obtained a temporary injunction ordering Arcor to resume limiting the accessibility to YouPorn.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,512460,00.html Landgericht zwingt Arcor zur Porno-Zensur], ''Spiegel Online'', 19 October 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/97676 Arcor muss YouPorn sperren], ''Heise Online'', 19 October 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 2007, Arcor started to control access to YouPorn again, this time with a [[domain name system|DNS]]-based approach that is easily circumvented,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,513053,00.html Arcor blockiert Zugang zu Youporn], ''Spiegel Online'', 23 October 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully filed an appeal against the injunction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/Arcor-muss-YouPorn-nicht-mehr-sperren--/meldung/106513 Heise.de: Arcor muss YouPorn nicht mehr sperren]. Heise.de, 15 April 2008. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchberg has sent notices to 19 German [[ISP]]s demanding that YouPorn be granted access limitations, but none have complied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,512821,00.html Abmahnwelle drÃ¤ngt Internetanbieter zur Web-Zensur], ''Spiegel Online'', 22 October 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts by Kirchberg to obtain injunctions regarding YouPorn from internet providers in [[Kiel]] and [[DÃ¼sseldorf]] were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.golem.de/0711/56153.html Golem.de: Gericht: Provider muss keine Pornoseiten sperren], 23 September 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/100513 Weiterer Antrag auf Sperrung von Pornoseiten zurÃ¼ckgewiesen], ''Heise Online'', 13 December 2007. {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
In May 2008 it was reported that [[Singapore]] had blocked access to YouPorn and [[RedTube]], in what a government officials described as &quot;a symbolic statement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSS2322899620080523 Singapore bans two porn websites in symbolic move], ''Reuters'', May 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
In July 2009 [[Sri Lanka]] blocked access to 12 porn web sites including YouPorn, [[RedTube]], [[XVideos|Xvideos]] and [[Xhamster]]. On 25 July 2009 Sri Lanka Chief Magistrate Nishantha Hapuarachchi ordered the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission to block those 12 websites from all local Internet Service Providers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sri-lankan-court-blocks-porn-websites/494041/ Sri Lankan court blocks porn websites], ''India Express'', July 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/breaking-news-technology/sri-lanka-court-blocks-porn-websites-20090725-dwov.html Sri Lanka court blocks porn websites], ''Brisbane Times, Australia'', July 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
