'''Prayer''' is a form of [[Religious_behaviour#Religious_actions|religious practice]] that seeks to activate a [[volitional]] [[rapport]] to a deity through deliberate practice. Prayer may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private. It may involve the use of words or song. When [[language]] is used, prayer may take the form of a [[hymn]], [[incantation]], formal [[creed]], or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person. There are different forms of prayer such as petitionary prayer, prayers of supplication, thanksgiving, and [[worship]]/praise. Prayer may be directed towards a [[deity]], spirit, deceased person, or lofty idea, for the purpose of worshipping, requesting [[counseling|guidance]], requesting assistance, confessing [[sin]]s or to express one's thoughts and emotions. Thus, people pray for many reasons such as personal benefit or for the sake of others.

Most major [[religion]]s involve prayer in one way or another. Some ritualize the act of prayer, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practiced spontaneously by anyone at any time.

Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. The efficacy of petition in prayer for physical healing to a deity has been evaluated in numerous studies, with contradictory results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galton&quot;&gt;Galton F.

Various spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, graces said over meals, and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] regard dancing as a form of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Littlebird|first= Sarracina|title =Sacred Movement: Dance as Prayer in the Pueblo Cultures of the American Southwest |publisher=Barnard College Department of Dance|date=2008|url=http://dance.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/sarracina_littlebird.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pray according to standardized rituals and liturgies, while others prefer extemporaneous prayers. Still others combine the two.

These methods show a variety of understandings to prayer, which are led by underlying beliefs.

These beliefs may be that
*the finite can communicate with the infinite
*the infinite is interested in communicating with the finite
*prayer is intended to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, rather than to influence the recipient
*prayer is intended to train a person to focus on the recipient through philosophy and intellectual contemplation
*prayer is intended to enable a person to gain a direct experience of the recipient
*prayer is intended to affect the very fabric of reality as we perceive it
*prayer is a catalyst for change in oneself and/or one's circumstances, or likewise those of third party beneficiaries
*the recipient desires and appreciates prayer
*or any combination of these.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The act of prayer is attested in written sources as early as 5000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Ferris J.|title=Ancient Near Eastern Texts|publisher=Princeton|year=1950|pages=391â92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[anthropology|anthropologists]], such as Sir [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and Sir [[James George Frazer]], believed that the earliest intelligent modern humans practiced something that we would recognize today as prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Zaleski, Carol; Zaleski, Philip|title=Prayer: A History|publisher=Mariner Books|location=Boston|year=2006|pages=24â25|isbn=0-618-77360-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Heiler]] is often cited in Christian circles for his systematic ''Typology of Prayer'' which lists six types of prayer: primitive, ritual, Greek cultural, philosophical, mystical, and prophetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Erickson, Millard J.|title=Christian theology|publisher=Baker Book House|location=Grand Rapids|year=1998|isbn=0-8010-2182-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The act of worship==
Prayer has many different forms. Prayer may be done privately and individually, or it may be done corporately in the presence of fellow believers. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily &quot;thought life&quot;, in which one is in constant communication with a god. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses. This is actually regarded as a requirement in several Christian denominations,&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{cite web| last=Knight|first=Kevin|authorlink=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Prayer|publisher=New Advent|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; although enforcement is not possible nor desirable. There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to interpret an answer to a question, if there in fact comes an answer.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; Some may experience audible, physical, or mental epiphanies. If indeed an answer comes, the time and place it comes is considered random.
Some outward acts that sometimes accompany prayer are: anointing with oil;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{bibleverse||James|5:14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; ringing a bell;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheckel|first=Roger J.|title=The Angelus| publisher = The Marian Catechists|date=January 2004|url= http://www.mariancatechist.com/html/spiritualdevelopment/prayer/sanctifyingyourdaywiththeangelus.htm|accessdate=2008-10-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080623093915/http://www.mariancatechist.com/html/spiritualdevelopment/prayer/sanctifyingyourdaywiththeangelus.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-23}}

&lt;/ref&gt; or the East); making the [[sign of the cross]]. One less noticeable act related to prayer is [[fasting]].

A variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.

==Pre-Christian Europe==
===Etruscan, Greek, and Roman paganism===
In the pre-Christian religions of Greeks and Romans ([[Ancient Greek religion]], [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]), ceremonial prayer was highly formulaic and [[ritual]]ized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayor|first=Diane|title=The Homeric Hymns| publisher=University of California Press|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9232/9232.intro.php| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religio Romana|publisher=Nova Roma|url=http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/posture.html|accessdate=2009-01-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iguvine Tables]] contain a supplication that can be translated, &quot;If anything was said improperly, if anything was done improperly, let it be as if it were done correctly.&quot;

The formalism and formulaic nature of these prayers led them to be written down in language that may have only been partially understood by the writer, and our texts of these prayers may in fact be garbled. Prayers in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] were used in the Roman world by [[augur]]s and other [[oracle]]s long after Etruscan became a dead language. The [[Carmen Arvale]] and the [[Carmen Saliare]] are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes, and whose language is full of [[archaism]]s and difficult passages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic De Forest Allen]], ''Remnants of Early Latin'' (Boston: Ginn &amp; Heath 1880 and Ginn &amp; Co 1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman prayers and [[sacrifice]]s were often envisioned as [[religious law|legal]] bargains between deity and worshipper. The Roman principle was expressed as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#do ut des|do ut des]]'': &quot;I give, so that you may give.&quot; [[Cato the Elder]]'s treatise on [[agriculture]] contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.&lt;ref&gt;Cato's Mars Prayer, found in ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'', translated at [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-texts/Mars-prayer.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic paganism===
[[Image:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The [[valkyrie]] [[SigrdrÃ­fa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[SigrdrÃ­fumÃ¡l]]''. Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
An amount of accounts of prayers to the [[Ãsir|gods]] in [[Germanic paganism]] survived the process of [[Christianization]], though only a single prayer has survived without the interjection of Christian references. This prayer is recorded in stanzas 2 and 3 of the poem ''[[SigrdrÃ­fumÃ¡l]]'', compiled in the 13th century ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' from earlier traditional sources, where the [[valkyrie]] [[SigrdrÃ­fa]] prays to the gods and the [[JÃ¶rÃ°|earth]] after being woken by the hero [[Sigurd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe25.htm Translation by Bellows.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A prayer to the bigger god [[Odin]] is mentioned in chapter 2 of the ''[[VÃ¶lsunga saga]]'' where King [[Rerir]] prays for a child. His prayer is answered by [[Frigg]], wife of Odin, who sends him an [[apple]], which is dropped on his lap by Frigg's servant in the form of a crow while Rerir is sitting on a [[tumulus|mound]]. Rerir's wife eats the apple and is then pregnant with the hero [[VÃ¶lsung]]. In stanza 9 of the poem ''[[OddrÃºnargrÃ¡tr]]'', a prayer is made to &quot;kind [[VÃ¦ttir|wights]], Frigg and [[Freyja]], and many gods,&quot; although since the poem is often considered one of the youngest poems in the Poetic Edda, the passage has been the matter of some debate.&lt;ref name=GRUNDY60&gt;[[Stephan Grundy|Grundy, Stephan]] (1998). &quot;Freyja and Frigg&quot; as collected in Billington, Sandra. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover The Concept of the Goddess]'', p. 60. [[Routledge]] ISBN 0415197899&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 21 of ''[[JÃ³msvÃ­kinga saga]]'', wishing to turn the tide of the [[Battle of HjÃ¶rungavÃ¡gr]], [[Haakon Sigurdsson]] eventually finds his prayers answered by the goddesses [[ÃorgerÃ°r HÃ¶lgabrÃºÃ°r and Irpa]] (the first of the two described as Haakon's patron goddess) who appear in the battle, kill many of the opposing fleet, and cause the remnants of their forces to flee. However, this depiction of a pagan prayer has been criticized as inaccurate due to the description of Haakon dropping to his knees.&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER100&gt;Hollander, Lee (trans.) (1955). ''The saga of the JÃ³msvÃ­kings'', p. 100. [[University of Texas Press]] ISBN 0292776233&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th century manuscript for the [[Anglo-Saxon]] charm ''[[Ãcerbot]]'' presents what is thought to be an originally [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan]] prayer for the fertility of the speaker's crops and land, though Christianization is apparent throughout the charm.&lt;ref name=GORDON88-90&gt;Gordon, R.K. (1962). Anglo-Saxon Poetry. Everyman's Library #794. M. Dent &amp; Sons, LTD.&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th century [[Wessobrunn Prayer]] has been proposed as a Christianized pagan prayer and compared to the pagan ''[[VÃ¶luspÃ¡]]''&lt;ref name=LAMBDIN227&gt;Lambdin, Laura C and Robert T. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature'', p. 227. Greenwood Publishing Group ISBN 0313300542&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Merseburg Incantations]], the latter recorded in the 9th or 10th century but of much older traditional origins.&lt;ref name=WELLS51&gt;Wells, C. J.&quot; (1985). ''German, a Linguistic History to 1945: A Linguistic History to 1945'', p  51. [[Oxford University Press]] ISBN 0198157959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrahamic religions==
===Bible===
In the common [[Bible]] of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, various forms of prayer appear; the most common forms being [[petition]], [[thanksgiving]], and [[worship]]. The longest book in the Bible is the [[Book of Psalms]], 150 religious songs which are often regarded as prayers. Other well-known Biblical prayers include the [[Song of Moses]] (Exodus 15:1-18), the [[Song of Hannah]] (1 Samuel 2:1-10), and the [[Magnificat]] (Luke 1:46-55). But perhaps the best-known prayer in the Christian Bible is the [[Lord's Prayer]] (Matthew 6:9â13; Luke 11:2-4).

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish prayer}}
[[Image:Jewish Canadian soldiers during WWII.jpg|left|thumb|Captain Samuel Cass, a rabbi, conducting the first prayer service celebrated on German territory by Jewish personnel of the 1st Canadian Army near Cleve, Germany, 18 March 1945.]]
Jews pray three times a day, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Arvit]] with lengthier prayers on special days, such as the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]] including [[Musaf]] and the reading of the [[Torah]]. The [[siddur]] is the prayerbook used by Jews all over the world, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: ''[[kavanah]]'' (intention) and ''keva'' (the ritualistic, structured elements).

The most important Jewish prayers are the [[Shema Yisrael]] (&quot;Hear O Israel&quot;) and the [[Amidah]] (&quot;the standing prayer&quot;).

Communal prayer is preferred over solitary prayer, and a quorum of 10 adult males (a [[minyan]]) is considered by [[Orthodox Judaism]] a prerequisite for several communal prayers.
[[Image:Women praying in the Western Wall tunnels by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Jewish]] women praying in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall tunnel]]]]

There are also many other ritualistic prayers a Jew performs during their day, such as washing before eating bread, washing after one wakes up in the morning, and doing grace after meals.

====Rationalist approach to prayer====
In this view, ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists.  One example of this approach to prayer is noted by [[Rabbi Steven Weil]], who was appointed the Orthodox Union's Executive-Vice President in 2009. He notes that the word âprayerâ is a derivative of the Latin âprecariâ, which means âto begâ.  The Hebrew equivalent âtefilahâ, however, along with its root âpelelâ or its reflexive âlâhitpallelâ, means the act of self-analysis or self-evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ou.org/torah/article/why_tefilah_doesn&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is sometimes described as the person praying having a dialogue or conversation with God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/862308/jewish/Jewish-Prayer.htm Jewish Prayer] from Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational approach to prayer====
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, [[Yehuda Halevy]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph Dov Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] Siddur (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).

====Kabbalistic approach to prayer====
[[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) uses a series of kavanot, directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/114937/jewish/The-Kabbalah.htm The Kabbalah of Prayer] on Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Jews, this approach has been taken by the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]] (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the [[Isaac Luria|Arizal's]] Kabbalist tradition, [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramchal]], most of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]], the [[Vilna Gaon]], and [[Jacob Emden]].

===Christianity===
{{Main|Prayer in Christianity|Christian worship}}

[[Image:Panagia.jpg|right|thumb|18th c. [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]]-style bronze [[panagia]] from [[Jerusalem]], showing the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] in the [[orans]] prayer posture.]]
Christian prayers are quite varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The most common prayer among Christians is the [[Lord's Prayer]], which according to the [[gospel]] accounts (e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#6:9|Matthew 6:9-13]]) is how [[Jesus]] taught his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 &gt;''Examining Religions: Christianity Foundation Edition'' by Anne Geldart 1999 ISBN 0435303244 page 108&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord's prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 /&gt;

Christians generally pray to God or to the Father. Some Christians (e.g., [[Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]) will also ask the righteous in heaven and &quot;in Christ,&quot; such as [[Virgin Mary]] or other saints to intercede by praying on their behalf ([[intercession of saints]]). Formulaic closures include &quot;through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all the ages of ages,&quot; and &quot;in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&quot;

It is customary among Protestants to end prayers with &quot;In [[Jesus]]' name, Amen&quot; or &quot;In the name of [[Christ]], Amen&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See John 16:23, 26; John 14:13; John 15:16&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most commonly used closure in Christianity is simply &quot;[[Amen]]&quot; (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement, usually translated as ''so be it'').

In the Western or [[Latin Rite]] of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], probably the most common is the [[Rosary]]; In the Eastern Church (the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern rites]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] and Orthodox Church), the [[Jesus Prayer]]. The Jesus Prayer is also often repeated as part of the [[Christian meditation|meditative]] [[hesychasm]] practice in [[Eastern Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Ken; David Melling (editors) (1999). ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'' ISBN 0-631-23203-6 page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins of others'', e.g. for the [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|repair of the sin of blasphemy]] performed by others.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pentecostalism====
In [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations, prayer is often done by speaking in a foreign tongue, a practice now known as [[glossolalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Pentecostal glossolalia may claim that the languages they speak in prayer are real foreign languages, and that the ability to speak those languages spontaneously is a gift of the [[Holy Spirit]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christianity - Pentecostalism|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Company|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm|accessdate=12-5-2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|2:1-13|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, many people outside the movement have offered alternative views. [[George Barton Cutten]] suggested that glossolalia was a sign of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;George Barton Cutten, ''Speaking with Tongues Historically and Psychologically Considered'', Yale University Press, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felicitas Goodman]] suggested that tongue speakers were under a form of hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Felicitas D., ''Speaking in Tongues: A Cross-Cultural Study in Glossolalia''. University of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that it is a learned behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.' ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 8, 2: (1969) 211â26: quote on p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samarin, William J., ''Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism''. Macmillan, New York, 1972, quote on p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these views have allegedly been refuted.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.' ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 8, 2: (1969) 211â26: quote on p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanos, Nicholas P.; Hewitt, Erin C.: Glossolalia: 'A test of the 'trance' and psychopathology hypotheses.' ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'': 1979 Aug Vol 88(4) 427â34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
{{ref-improve|section|date=November 2011}}
[[Christian Science]] teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality (the &quot;[[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]]&quot; in Biblical terms) into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Christian Scientists do not practice [[intercessory prayer]] as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. (However, the choice of healing method is regarded as a matter for the individual, and the Christian Science Church exerts no pressure on members to avoid medical treatment if they wish to avail of it as an alternative to Christian Science healing.) Prayer works through [[love]]: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Christian Science Q&amp;A|title=Is there no intercessory prayer?|url=http://www.christianscience.org/QAIsthereintercesprayer.html|accessdate=2007-10-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevalence of prayer for health====
Some modalities of [[alternative medicine]] employ prayer. A [http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm survey released in May 2004] by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others' health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.

{{Main|Salah}}
[[Muslim]]s pray a ritualistic prayer called ''[[salah]]'' or ''salat'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], facing the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]], five times a day. The command to pray is in the Quran in several chapters. The prophet Muhammed showed each Muslim the true method of offering prayers thus the same method is observed till date. There is the &quot;call for prayer&quot; (''[[adhan]]'' or ''azaan''), where the ''[[muezzin]]'' calls for all the followers to stand together for the prayer. The prayer consists of standing, by mentioning -Ã llÃ h o -Ã qbÃ r (God is great) followed by recitation of the first chapter of the Quran. After the person bends and praises god, then prostrates and again praises god. The prayer ends with the following words &quot;peace and blessings be upon you&quot;. During the prayer a Muslim cannot talk or do anything else besides praying. Once the prayer is complete one can offer voluntary prayers or supplicate -Ã llÃ h for his needs. There are also many standard [[dua]]s or supplications, also in [[Arabic]], to be recited at various times, ''e.g.'' for one's parents, after salah, before eating. Muslims may also say ''dua'' in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers.&lt;ref name=Emerick/&gt; Certain Shia fiqhs pray 3 times a day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UlaBw3MUGBEC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=shia+pray+3+times&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=urkrTeT9MM6IhQeAwrydCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Muslim cultures today: a reference guide] By Kathryn M.

[[BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h]], the [[BÃ¡b]], and [[`Abdu'l-BahÃ¡]] have revealed many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others. [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith|BahÃ¡'Ã­]]s are also required to recite each day one of three [[Obligatory BahÃ¡'Ã­ prayers|obligatory prayers]] revealed by [[BahÃ¡'u'llÃ¡h]]. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the [[Qiblih]] when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. BahÃ¡'Ã­s also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=P.|year=1999|title =A Concise Encyclopedia of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford, UK|pages=274â75|isbn=1851681841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern religions==
In contrast with [[Western religion]], [[Eastern religion]] for the most part discards [[worship]] and places devotional emphasis on the practice of [[meditation]] alongside scriptural study. Consequently, prayer is seen as a form of meditation or an adjunct practice to meditation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Incense-LE.jpg|right|thumb|[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] praying at [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Thailand]].]]
In certain Buddhist sects, prayer accompanies [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]. [[Buddhism]] for the most part sees prayer as a secondary, supportive practice to meditation and [[Dharma (Buddhism)|scriptural study]]. [[Gautama Buddha]] claimed that human beings possess the capacity and potential to become liberated, or [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]], through [[contemplation]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Bhavana|bhÄvana]]'' and ''[[DhyÄna in Buddhism|dhyÄna]]''), leading to [[VipassanÄ|insight]]. Prayer is seen mainly as a powerful psycho-physical practice that can enhance meditation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example http://www.centreguephel.org/prieres.html {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Buddhist tradition, the [[Theravada]], and in the later [[Mahayana]] tradition of [[Zen]] (or [[ChÃ¡n]]), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dizang.org/dzfm/qt21.htm å¸¸ç¨åååãååæ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/avalokiteshvara-ommanipadmehum/article?mid=141 å¸¸ç¨è¿´åååè¼¯]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.netvigator.com/~jalee/budd_text01.html æºæãç¦®æãç¼é¡ãååæ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Collins|first=Steven|title=Selfless Persons|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1982|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=6|isbn=0-521-39726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UpÄya|skillful means]] (Sanskrit: ''upÄya'') of the transfer of merit (Sanskrit: ''[[pariá¹ÄmanÄ]]'') is an [[evocation]] and prayer. Moreover, indeterminate buddhas are available for intercession as they reside in awoken-fields (Sanskrit: ''buddha-kshetra'').

The ''[[Trikaya|nirmÄnakÄya]]'' of an awoken-field is what is generally known and understood as a [[mandala]]. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: ''maá¹á¸ala'') is an active prayer. An active prayer is a mindful activity, an activity in which [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] is not just cultivated but ''is''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangharakshita|first=Bhikshu|title=A Survey of Buddhism|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1993|location=Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom|pages=449â60|isbn=0 904766 65 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common prayer is  &quot;May the merit of my practice, adorn Buddhas' Pure Lands, requite the fourfold kindness from above, and relieve the suffering of the three life-journeys below.

The [[Generation Stage]] (Sanskrit: ''utpatti-krama'') of Vajrayana involves prayer elements.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''. Great Britain, Oxford: Oxford University Press. P.100. ISBN 0-19-860560-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tibetan Buddhism]] tradition emphasizes an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as [[guru yoga]] which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits the existence of various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or [[yidam]] are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: ''santana''; refer [[mindstream]]) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage ''yidam'' or [[tutelary deities]] will depend upon the level or more appropriately ''[[yana (Buddhism)|yana]]'' at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is ''[[ÅÅ«nyatÄ]]''. The views of the more esoteric yana are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] emphasizes the recitation by devotees of prayer-like [[mantra]]s, a practice often called [[Nembutsu]].&lt;ref name=smithnovak03&gt;&quot;The Flowering of Faith: Buddhism's Pure Land Tradition&quot; (pp. 185â98) in {{cite book

According to [[Shinran]], the founder of the [[Pure Land Buddhism]] tradition that is most prevalent in the US,&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Novak (2003) state that &quot;Pure Land Buddhism has entered America almost exclusively from Japan, and the church Shinran founded is the largest Pure Land presence on this continent&quot; (p. 193).&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;for the long haul nothing is as efficacious as the [[Nembutsu]].&quot;&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|197}}&lt;ref&gt;This quotation is Smith and Novak's paraphrase of Shinran's teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realization.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

But beyond all these practices the Buddha emphasized the primacy of individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary. Nevertheless, today many lay people in East Asian countries pray to the Buddha in ways that resemble Western prayerâasking for intervention and offering devotion.

===Hinduism===
[[Image:Bangladesh Prayer.jpg|thumb|Shakta Hindus in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, pray to the goddess during ''[[Durga Puja]]'', October 2003.]]
{{Main|Prayer in Hinduism}}
{{ref-improve|section|date=November 2011}}
[[Hinduism]] has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: ''prÄrthanÄ''), from fire-based [[yajna|rituals]] to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, dhyanam involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as devtas, trinity or incarnation of either devtas or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. All of these are directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment. Ritual [[invocation]] was part and parcel of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the [[Vedas]], are a large collection of [[mantra]]s and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, [[Brahman]], that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the [[Hindu pantheon]]{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}. Hindus in [[India]] have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to Its three manifestations namely creator god called [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]], preserver god called [[Vishnu]] and destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) [[Shiva]], and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together in ''[[pranam]]''. The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting ''[[namaste]]''.

===Jainism===
Although [[Jainism]] believes that no spirit or divine being can assist them on their path, these figures do hold some influence on believers, and on special occasions, Jains will pray for right knowledge to the twenty-four [[Tirthankara]]s or sometimes to deities such as [[Ganesha]] or protectors such as the [[Yaksha]]s and [[Yakshini]]s.

===Shinto===
[[Image:ShintÅ prayer.jpg|thumb|A man praying at a [[Japan]]ese [[Shinto shrine]].]]
{{Main|Shinto|Ema (ShintÅ)}}
{{ref-improve|section|date=November 2011}}
The practices involved in [[Shinto]] prayer are heavily influenced by Buddhism; Japanese Buddhism has also been strongly influenced by Shinto in turn. The most common and basic form of devotion involves throwing a coin, or several, into a collection box, ringing a bell, clapping one's hands, and contemplating one's wish or prayer silently. The bell and hand clapping are meant to wake up or attract the attention of the ''[[kami]]'' of the shrine, so that one's prayer may be heard.

Shinto prayers quite frequently consist of wishes or favors asked of the ''kami'', rather than lengthy praises or devotions. Unlike in certain other faiths, it is not considered irregular or inappropriate to ask favors of the ''kami'' in this way, and indeed many shrines are associated with particular favors, such as success on exams.

In addition, one may write one's wish on a small wooden tablet, called an ''[[ema (ShintÅ)|ema]]'', and leave it hanging at the [[Shinto shrine|shrine]], where the ''kami'' can read it. If the wish is granted, one may return to the shrine to leave another ''ema'' as an act of thanksgiving.

===Sikhism===
[[Image:BhaiSahibJiArdas.jpg|thumb|160px|A Sikh holy man, doing Sikh Prayer ([[ArdÄs]])]]
The [[ArdÄs]] (Punjabi: à¨à¨°à¨¦à¨¾à¨¸) is a [[Sikh]] prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily [[Banis]] (prayers); or completion of a service like the [[Paath]] (scripture reading/recitation), [[kirtan]] (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.

The Ardas is usually always done standing up with folded hands. The beginning of the Ardas is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses word like &quot;[[Waheguru]] please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake&quot; when starting a new task or &quot;[[Akal Purakh]], having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times&quot;, etc. The word &quot;ArdÄs&quot; is derived from Persian word 'Arazdashat', meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.

ArdÄs is a unique prayer based on the fact that it is one of the few well-known prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The ArdÄs cannot be found within the pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word ArdÄs into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all that he has done.&lt;ref&gt;www.sgpc.net/ardas/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
Prayer in Taoism is less common than [[Fulu]], which is the drawing and writing of supernatural talismans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.8763456.com/2004/12-18/15183458963.html Chapter IV: Category of fierce types of spells for explanation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20tv.cn/showart.asp?art_id=331&amp;page=1 ç¥åéå]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animism==
{{Main|Animism|Shamanism}}
Although prayer in its literal sense is not used in [[animism]], communication with the spirit world is vital to the animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a [[shaman]] who, through a trance, gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits' thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using [[astrology]] or contemplating [[Fortune telling|fortune tellers]] and healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omf.org/omf/cambodia/about_cambodia/animism_profile|publisher=OMF|title=Animism Profile in Cambodia|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The native religions in some parts of North, East and South Asia, [[Americas|America]], [[Africa]], and [[Oceania]] are often animistic.

===America===
{{Main|Aztec religion}}
The Aztec religion was not strictly animist. It had an ever increasing pantheon of deities, and the shamans performed ritual prayer to these deities in their respective temples. These shamans made petitions to the proper deities in exchange for a sacrifice offering: food, flowers, effigies, and animals, usually quail. But the larger the thing required from the God the larger the sacrifice had to be, and for the most important rites one would offer one's own blood; by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest or genitals, and often a human life; either warrior, slave, or even self-sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassig|first=Ross|title=El sacrificio y las guerras floridas|journal=[[ArqueologÃ­a mexicana]]|volume=XI|pages=47|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] Indians are known to have used [[prayer stick]]s, that is, sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings. The [[Hopi]] Indians used prayer sticks as well, but they attached to it a small bag of sacred meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Prayer stick|encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian Aboriginal mythology|Dreamtime}}
In [[Australia]], prayers to the &quot;Great Wit&quot; are performed by the &quot;clever wapmen&quot; and &quot;clever women&quot;, or ''kadji''. These [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] shamans use [[maban]] or mabain, the material that is believed to give them their purported magical powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elkin|first=Adolphus P.|title=Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition|publisher=Inner Traditions - Bear &amp; Company|year=1973|isbn=0892814217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
{{ref-improve|section|date=November 2011}}
Adherents to forms of modern [[Neopaganism]] pray to various gods. The most commonly worshiped and prayed to gods are those of Pre-Christian Europe, such as [[Celtic Mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse Mythology|Norse]], or [[Greek Mythology|Graeco-Roman]] gods. Prayer can vary from sect to sect, and with some (such as Wicca) prayer may also be associated with ritual [[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]].

==Theurgy and Western Esotericism==
{{ref-improve|section|date=November 2011}}
Practitioners of [[theurgy]] and [[western esotericism]] may practice a form of ritual which utilizes both pre-sanctioned prayers and names of God, and prayers &quot;from the heart&quot; that, when combined, allows the participant to ascend spiritually, and in some instances, induce a trance in which God or other spiritual beings may be realized. Very similar to hermetic qabala, and orthodox [[qabala]], it is believed that prayer can influence both the physical and non-physical worlds. The use of ritualistic signs and names are believed to be archetypes in which the subconscious may take form as the [[Inner God]], or another spiritual being, and the &quot;prayer from the heart&quot; to be that spiritual force speaking through the participant.

==Meher Baba==
The Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] emphasized both the beauty of prayer as praise and the power of prayer as petition:

&quot;The ideal prayer to the Lord is nothing more than spontaneous praise of His being. You praise Him, not in the spirit of bargain but in the spirit of self-forgetful appreciation of what He really is. You praise Him because He is praiseworthy. Your praise is a 
spontaneous appreciative response to his true being, as infinite light, infinite power and infinite bliss.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]], [http://ambppct.org/meherbaba/Book_Files/Beams.pdf ''Beams from Meher Baba on the Spiritual Panorama''], San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented, 1958, pp. 74-75, ISBN 0060802332.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&quot;Through repeated sincere prayers it is possible to effect an exit from the otherwise inexorable working out of the law of karma.
The forgiveness asked from God evokes from Him His inscrutable grace, which alone can give new direction to the inexorable karmic determination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]], [http://ambppct.org/meherbaba/Book_Files/Beams.pdf ''Beams from Meher Baba on the Spiritual Panorama''], San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented, 1958, p. 38, ISBN 0060802332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approaches to prayer==
[[Image:Albrecht DÃ¼rer Betende HÃ¤nde.jpg|thumb|upright|''Praying Hands'' by [[Albrecht DÃ¼rer]] showing the hand position of a medieval [[commendation ceremony]].]]

===Direct petitions to God===
From Biblical times to today, the most common form of prayer is to directly appeal to God to grant one's requests. This in many ways is the simplest form of prayer. Some have termed this the social approach to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Moshe. Biblical Prose Prayer: As a Window to the Popular Religion of Ancient Israel. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1983 [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft8b69p1w7/]&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, a person directly enters into God's rest, and asks for their needs to be fulfilled. God listens to the prayer, and may so or not choose to answer in the way one asks of him. This is the primary approach to prayer found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud.

===Educational approach===
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] [[Siddur]] (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII).

Among Christian theologians, [[Edward McKendree Bounds|E.M. Bounds]] stated the educational purpose of prayer in every chapter of his book, ''The Necessity of Prayer''. Prayer books such as the [[Book of Common Prayer]] are both a result of this approach and an exhortation to keep it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bounds|first=Edward McKendree|title=The Necessity of Prayer|publisher=AGES Software|year=1907|isbn=0801006597}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Among Muslim theologians.... (please add examples here).
--&gt;

===Rationalist approach===
{{ref-improve|section|date=November 2011}}
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists; it became popular in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths. In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority of people still hold to this approach.

===Experiential approach===
{{ref-improve|section|date=November 2011}}
In this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], this approach is known as [[hesychasm]]. It is also widespread in [[Sufi]] Islam, and in some forms of [[mysticism]]. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve [[contemplation]], although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual.

===Transformative approach===
{{ref-improve|section|date=November 2011}}
In this approach, prayer enables an existential transformation in the person praying. The act of praying elicits a new kind of understanding which wasn't apparent before praying. The Danish philosopher [[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard]] wrote that &quot;the function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.&quot;

==Prayer groups==
A prayer group is a group of people that meet to pray together. These groups, formed mostly within Christian congregations but occasionally among Muslim groups as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Islamic Prayer Group (U.K)|title=Islamicprayergroup.com|year=2008|url=http://islamicprayergroup.com|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather outside of the congregation's regular worship service to pray for perceived needs, sometimes within the congregation, sometimes within their religious group at large. However, these groups often pray also for the world around them, including people who do not share their beliefs.

Many prayer group meetings are held according to a regular schedule, usually once a week. However, extraordinary events, such as the [[September 11 attacks]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WWPG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wide Prayer Group|url=http://www.worldwideprayergroup.org|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or major disasters spawned a number of improvised prayer group meetings. Prayer groups do not need to meet in person, and there are a vast array of single-purpose prayer groups in the world.

==Prayer healing==
{{main|Faith healing}}
Prayer is often used as a means of [[faith healing]] in an attempt to use [[religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] means to prevent illness, cure [[disease]], or improve health. Some attempt to heal by prayer, mental practices, spiritual insights, or other techniques, claiming they can summon divine or supernatural intervention on behalf of the ill. Others advocate that ill people may achieve healing through prayer performed by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pell-adamant-prayer-cures-cancer-20091221-l8fy.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=Pell adamant prayer cures cancer|date=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the varied beliefs of those who practice it, faith healing may be said to afford gradual relief from pain or sickness or to bring about a sudden &quot;miracle cure&quot;, and it may be used in place of, or in tandem with, conventional medical techniques for alleviating or curing diseases. Faith healing has been criticized on the grounds that those who use it may delay seeking potentially curative conventional medical care. This is particularly problematic when parents use faith healing techniques on children.

===Efficacy of prayer healing===
{{main|Efficacy of prayer}}

In 1872, [[Francis Galton]] conducted a famous [[statistics|statistical]] experiment to determine whether prayer had a physical effect on the external environment. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galton&quot;/&gt; While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of [[Confounding variable|confounders]], it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.

Two studies claimed that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened.&lt;ref&gt;http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/07/prayer_still_us.html Prayer still useless&lt;/ref&gt; One such study, with a [[double-blind]] design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthMedJ&quot;/&gt; Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Infidels&quot;/&gt; Another such study was reported by Harris et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began,&lt;ref&gt;Tessman I and Tessman J &quot;Efficacy of Prayer: A Critical Examination of Claims,&quot; Skeptical Inquirer, March/April 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).

One of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990â96, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.&lt;ref&gt;Leibovici L.

Several studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Laoire&quot;/&gt; A 2001 double-blind study of the [[Mayo Clinic]] found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;Aviles JM, Whelan SE, Hernke DA, Williams BA, Kenny KE, O'Fallon WM, Kopecky SL. Intercessory prayer and cardiovascular disease progression in a coronary care unit population: a randomized controlled trial. ''Mayo Clin Proc'' 2001;76:1192-8. PMID 11761499.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Krucoff MW, Crater SW, Gallup D, Blankenship JC, Cuffe M, Guarneri M, Krieger RA, Kshettry VR, Morris K, Oz M, Pichard A, Sketch MH Jr, Koenig HG, Mark D, Lee KL. Music, imagery, touch, and prayer as adjuncts to interventional cardiac care: the Monitoring and Actualisation of Noetic Trainings (MANTRA) II randomised study. ''Lancet'' 2005;366:211-7. PMID 16023511.&lt;/ref&gt; In another similar study published in the ''American Heart Journal'' in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in cardiac bypass patients: A multicenter randomized trial of uncertainty and certainty of receiving intercessory prayer [http://www.ahjonline.com/article/PIIS0002870305006496/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;STEP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2139373/ The Deity in the DataWhat the latest prayer study tells us about God]&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of [[cardiac bypass]] patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Benson ''et al.'', &quot;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569567 Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in cardiac bypass patients: A multicenter randomized trial of uncertainty and certainty of receiving intercessory prayer]&quot;, American Heart Journal, Volume 151, No 4, 934-42 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many believe that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See [[Subject-expectancy effect]].) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, &quot;the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=/Atoz/dc/cen/canc/gen/mindspirit.html#7 Mind and Spirit]. ''from the Health Library section of'' [http://www.centrastate.com CentraState Healthcare System]. Accessed May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other practices such as [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], and [[meditation]] may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.

Others feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The previously mentioned American Heart Journal study published in the ''American Heart Journal'' indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them,&lt;ref name=&quot;STEP&quot;/&gt; saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: {{quote|Prior to the start of this study, intercessors reported that they usually receive information about the patientâs age, gender and progress reports on their medical condition; converse with family members or the patient (not by fax from a third party); use individualized prayers of their own choosing; and pray for a variable time period based on patient or family request.}}

One scientific movement attempts to track the physical effects of prayer through [[neuroscience]]. Leaders in this movement include [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]], an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  In Newberg's brain scans, monks,  priests, nuns and gurus alike have exceptionally focused attention and compassion sites.  This is a result of the frontal lobe of the brainâs engagement (Newberg, 2009). Newburg believes that anybody can connect to the supernatural with practice. Those without religious affiliations benefit from the connection to the metaphysical as well. Newberg also states that further evidence towards humans' need for metaphysical relationships is that as science had increased spirituality has not decreased. Newburg believes that at the end of the eighteenth century, when the scientific method began to consume{{page needed|date=September 2010}} the human mind, religion could have vanished. However, two hundred years later, the perception of spirituality, in many instances, appears to be gaining in strength (2009). Newberg's research also provides the connection between prayer and meditation and health. By understanding how the brain works during religious experiences and practices Newberg's research shows that the brain changes during these practices allowing an understanding of how religion affects psychological and physical health (2009).  For example, brain activity during [[meditation]] indicates that people who frequently practice prayer or meditation  experience lower blood-pressure, lower heart rates, decreased anxiety, and decreased depression.&lt;ref&gt;Newberg, Andrew.
