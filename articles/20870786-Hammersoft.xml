===Coaching changes===
====Hiring Todd Haley====
The decision to hire Scott Pioli as general manager likely meant that head coach [[Herman Edwards]] would not return for a fourth season as Chiefs head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pioli to join&quot;/&gt; The ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' reported that according to two coaches, Edwards and his staff could have been dismissed as soon as Wednesday, January 14,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pioli to join&quot;/&gt; the day when Pioli was introduced in Kansas City.&lt;ref name=&quot;introduces&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Clark Hunt introduces General Manager Scott Pioli | url=http://www.kcchiefs.com/news/2009/01/14/clark_hunt_introduces_general_manager_scott_pioli/ | date=2009-01-14 | accessdate=2009-01-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his press conference, Pioli did not rule out Edwards being retained as the team's head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs fire Edwards&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;introduces&quot;/&gt; Hunt said publicly that he wanted Edwards to return in 2009, but Pioli would have &quot;significant input&quot; in the final decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pioli to join&quot;/&gt;

Several candidates were mentioned as possible replacements for Edwards even before he had been fired. The most notable names mentioned were [[Todd Haley]], the offensive coordinator of the 2008 NFC Champion [[Arizona Cardinals]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Haley&quot;/&gt; [[New York Giants]] defensive coordinator [[Steve Spagnuolo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Pioli to join&quot;/&gt; and [[Mike Shanahan]], the former head coach of the Chiefs' rival Raiders and Broncos franchises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mike Shanahan could be next Chiefs head coach | url=http://www.nbcactionnews.com/sports/story/Mike-Shanahan-Could-be-Next-Chiefs-Head-Coach/EjWyJUYPT0q-lAAApuqgXw.cspx | last=Harry | first=Jack | publisher=NBC Action News, Kansas City | date=2009-01-21 | accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Herm out, Shanahan In? | url=http://www.profootballtalk.com/2009/01/22/herm-out-shanahan-in/ | last=Florio | first=Mike | publisher=Pro Football Talk | date=2009-01-21 | accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible candidates included [[Jon Gruden]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Slant&quot;/&gt; [[Leslie Frazier]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Slant&quot;/&gt; [[Winston Moss]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Slant&quot;/&gt; [[Kirk Ferentz]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Slant&quot;/&gt; [[Jason Garrett]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Slant&quot;/&gt; and even Scott Pioli's father-in-law, [[Bill Parcells]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Slant&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Kansas city Chiefs Inside Slant | url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/4809758/Kansas-City-Chiefs-Inside-Slant | author=Sports Xchange | publisher=Fox Sports | date=2009-01-24 | accessdate=2009-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards was fired on January 23, and [[ESPN]]'s [[Chris Mortensen]] reported later that evening that the Chiefs were targeting Mike Shanahan to become the next head coach. Mortensen initially reported that the Chiefs were negotiating on a contract with Shanahan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs fire Edwards&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Chiefs fire Edwards; Shanahan next? | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3855917 | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2009-01-23 | accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards relieved&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Herm Edwards relieved of duties as Chiefs head coach | url=http://kcchiefs.com/news/2009/01/23/herm_edwards_relieved_of_duties_as_chiefs_head_coach/ | date=2009-01-23 | accessdate=2009-01-23 | publisher=Kansas City Chiefs}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was later denied by Shanahan himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shanahan definitely&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Shanahan will 'definitely' not coach Chiefs, or anyone else in 2009 | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/football/nfl/01/24/shanahan.chiefs/index.html | last=King | publisher=Sports Illustrated | first=Peter | date=2009-01-24 | accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long period in which Haley was considered the front-runner for the head coaching position, there was concern as to whether the Chiefs would violate the [[Rooney Rule]] by immediately hiring Haley.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wooten&quot;/&gt; The Rooney Rule, named after Pittsburgh Steelers owner [[Dan Rooney]], specifies that NFL teams must give fair interviews to minority candidates whenever a head coaching position comes open.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wooten&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Wooten says KC has interviewed minority candidates | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2009-02-05-4055823280_x.htm | last=Tucker | first=Doug | work=USA Today | date=2009-02-05 | accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some minority coaches were reportedly turning down offers from the Chiefs since Haley was the presumed target for the coaching vacancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wooten&quot;/&gt; The Chiefs negotiated with Haley following the Cardinals' loss in [[Super Bowl XLIII]], and Haley accepted the coaching position on February 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haley&quot;/&gt; Haley was introduced as head coach the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haley named&quot;/&gt;

Initially there were doubts as to whether Chan Gailey would retained under Todd Haley's coaching staff, being that Haley had just concluded a successful stint as offensive coordinator at Arizona.

====Additions====
Despite having several needs to be addressed and nearly $35 million in salary cap room, the Chiefs were criticized for being &quot;quiet&quot; in free-agency after the Cassel/Vrabel trade, primarily adding back-up players for depth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Williamson March 13&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=AFC West Blog â Around AFC West â March 13, 2009 | url=http://myespn.go.com/blogs/afcwest/0-3-1769/Around-AFC-West.html | last=Williamson | first=Bill | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2009-03-13 | accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who is making&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=AFC West Blog â Who is making the grade in the AFC West? â March 13, 2009 | url=http://myespn.go.com/blogs/afcwest/0-3-1768/Who-is-making-the-grade-in-the-AFC-West-.html | last=Williamson | first=Bill | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2009-03-13 | accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cassel/Vrabel trade=====
[[File:Matt Cassell.jpg|right|thumb|Matt Cassel was acquired in February.]]
On the first day of free agency (February 27), the Chiefs acquired LB [[Mike Vrabel]] from the Patriots for an undisclosed draft pick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vrabel from Patriots&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Kansas City Chiefs acquire LB Mike Vrabel from Patriots | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3940213 | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2009-02-27 | accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassel, Vrabel&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Chiefs acquire QB Matt Cassel, LB Mike Vrabel in trade with Patriots | url=http://kcchiefs.com/news/2009/02/28/chiefs_acquire_qb_matt_cassel_lb_mike_vrabel_in_trade_with_patriots/ | publisher=Kansas City Chiefs | date=2009-02-28 | accessdate=2009-02-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' speculated that it would be part of a bigger trade involving QB [[Matt Cassel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mike Vrabel analysis&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Mike Vrabel analysis | url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2009/02/mike_vrabel_ana.html | last=Reiss | first=Mike | publisher=Boston Globe | date=2009-02-28 | accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Chiefs confirmed the acquisition of both Vrabel and Cassel from New England in exchange for their second round draft selection in the [[2009 NFL Draft]] (#34 overall).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassel, Vrabel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs complete&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Chiefs complete trade for Cassel | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/peter_king/02/28/chiefs.trade.for.cassel/index.html | last=King | first=Peter | publisher=Sports Illustrated | date=2009-02-28 | accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions to the trade were mixed and it was called &quot;monumentally lopsided&quot; with the Chiefs &quot;clearly (getting) the better end of the deal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs keep quiet&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Chiefs keep quiet after landing Cassel, Vrabel in steal of a deal with Pats | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80f07e50&amp;template=without-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true | author=Associated Press | publisher=NFL.com | date=2009-03-02 | accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Banks]] of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' called the Chiefs the &quot;big winners&quot; of the first weekend of NFL free agency and the Patriots' compensation &quot;laughably low,&quot; but the best they could get in return.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patriots could&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Patriots could have asked for more | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/don_banks/02/28/cassel.traded.chiefs/index.html?eref=T1 | last=Banks | first=Don | publisher=Sports Illustrated | date=2009-02-28 | accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Were the Patriots&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Were the Patriots robbed by the Chiefs?

The Patriots also have [[Tom Brady]] under contract, who is recovering from a knee-injury sufffered in a 2008 game against the Chiefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matt Cassel analysis&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Matt Cassel analysis | url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/ | last=Reiss | first=Mike | publisher=Boston Globe | date=2009-02-28 | accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chiefs returned home to host the [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]] in an attempt to create the biggest upset of the week&lt;ref name='odds'&gt;The Steelers were favored by 11.5 points on Yahoo's combined line odds (which is removed from online view when the game begins), the widest margin for Week 11 in the NFL.&lt;/ref&gt; and get their first back-to-back wins since 2007.  Optimism grew quickly as [[Jamaal Charles]] ran the opening kick 97 yards for a touchdown, starting the game with a 7â0 Chiefs lead.

The Steelers dominated the rest of the first half with 20:45 time of possession, going into halftime with a 17â7 lead.

By the fourth quarter, the Chiefs tied the game up at 17â17.  The fourth quarter resulted in a touchdown each, sending the game into overtime.

The Chiefs defense began the game by demonstrating how unpredictable they have been all season.  After giving up three plays of 10 yards or more, [[Mike Brown (American football)|Mike Brown]] intercepted what would likely have been a touchdown pass, giving the Chiefs offense a chance to take the field.  After a short run and two incomplete passes, the Chiefs punted back to Denver.  The Chiefs defense nearly forced the Broncos to a three-and-out, but the drive was kept going by a [[Ron Edwards (American football)|Ron Edwards]] face mask call.  The end result was a [[Kyle Orton]] to [[Daniel Graham]] touchdown pass.

The Chiefs offense responded by putting together a relatively long series that began at the KC 31 and lasted 20 plays, ending in a 22 yard [[Ryan Succop]] field goal.  After a couple possession changes, the Broncos answered with a series that included three [[Correll Buckhalter]] rushes for over 10 yards, ending in a [[Knowshon Moreno]] rushing touchdown.  The Chiefs would respond before the half with another field goal.

The second began with the Chiefs failing to convert on fourth down and the Broncos scoring on each of their first three possessions.  Before the end of the quarter, [[Matt Cassel]] was replaced by [[Brodie Croyle]].  After the Chiefs lost a [[Jamal Charles]] fumble for a touchdown, they recovered a Kyle Orton fumble and eventually turned it into a Jamal Charles rushing touchdown.  The Broncos immediately responded with yet another touchdown.

With the loss, the Chiefs fall to 3â9.
