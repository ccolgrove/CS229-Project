'''Manjot Singh''' is a Indian Bollywood actor, most famous for his role in the film ''[[Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!]]'' as the young Lucky.

==Childhood==
Manjot Singh was born in a [[Sikh]] family. His father is a doctor and mother is in government service.

==Debut==

Manjotâs father came to know that [[Paramjot Singh]] and his team were in [[Delhi]] scouting for actors and asked his son if he wanted to try it out. They went to [[Arvinder]] for an audition though Manjot had never acted before, even in school plays. After the audition  
the casting director of [[Dibakar Banerjee]]âs [[Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye!]] rejected Manjot Singh for the role of the boy who grows up to be master thief Lucky. However [[Dibakar Banerjee]] knew he had found his Lucky. âEven though the casting director wasnât convinced, I just put my foot down,â the director said.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/oye-lucky/426655/2 Oye Lucky] [[Indian Express]], 22 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
After being selected, Manjot went to [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] for a week long acting workshop. He was asked to observe the way [[Abhay Deol]] walked, smiled and talked so that he could imitate that in his acting. He even wore a cheek pad so that his jaw would look as broad as [[Abhay Deol]]âs.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;
