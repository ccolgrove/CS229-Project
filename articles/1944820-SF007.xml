'''Ettercap''' is a [[free and open source]] [[network security]] tool for [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s on [[LAN]]. It can be used for computer [[network protocol]] analysis and [[computer security|security]] [[Information technology security audit|auditing]]. It runs on various [[Unix-like]] [[operating systems]] including [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[BSD]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and on [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is capable of intercepting traffic on a network segment, capturing passwords, and conducting [[man-in-the-middle attack|active eavesdropping]] against a number of common protocols. It is ranked number 11 in the Top 100 Network Security Tools list released by [[insecure.org]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 100 Network Security Tools&quot;&gt;[http://sectools.org Top 100 Network Security Tools]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functionality==
Ettercap works by putting the network interface into [[promiscuous mode]] and by [[Arp poisoning]] the target machines. Thereby it can act as a 'man in the middle' and unleash various attacks on the victims. Ettercap has plugin support so that the features can be extended by adding new plugins.

==Features==
Ettercap supports active and passive dissection of many [[protocol (computing)|protocols]] (including ciphered ones) and provides many features for network and host analysis. Ettercap offers four modes of operation:

* IP-based: packets are filtered based on IP source and destination.
* MAC-based: packets are filtered based on [[MAC address]], useful for sniffing connections through a gateway.
* [[Address Resolution Protocol|ARP]]-based: uses [[ARP poisoning]] to sniff on a switched LAN between two hosts (full-duplex).
* PublicARP-based: uses ARP poisoning to sniff on a switched LAN from a victim host to all other hosts (half-duplex).

In addition, the software also offers the following features:

* Character injection into an established connection: characters can be injected into a [[server (computing)|server]] (emulating commands) or to a [[client (computing)|client]] (emulating replies) while maintaining a live connection.

* SSH1 support: the sniffing of a username and password, and even the data of an SSH1 connection. Ettercap is the first software capable of [[packet sniffer|sniffing]] an [[Secure Shell|SSH]] connection in full duplex.

* HTTPS support: the sniffing of HTTP [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] secured dataâeven when the connection is made through a [[proxy server|proxy]].

* Remote traffic through a [[Generic Routing Encapsulation|GRE]] tunnel: the sniffing of remote traffic through a GRE tunnel from a remote [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] [[router (computing)|router]], and perform a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] on it.

* Plug-in support: creation of custom plugins using Ettercap's [[Application Programming Interface|API]].

* Password collectors for: [[TELNET]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Post Office Protocol|POP]], [[IMAP]], [[rlogin]], [[Secure Shell|SSH1]], [[ICQ]], [[Server Message Block|SMB]], [[MySQL]], [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]], [[X Window System|X11]], [[Napster]], [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], [[Routing Information Protocol|RIP]], [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]], [[SOCKS|SOCKS 5]], [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP 4]], [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]], [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]], [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]], [[Quake III Arena|Quake 3]], [[MSN Messenger|MSN]], [[Yahoo! Messenger Protocol|YMSG]]

* Packet filtering/dropping: setting up a filter that searches for a particular string (or hexadecimal sequence) in the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] payload and replaces it with a custom string/sequence of choice, or drops the entire packet.

* [[OS fingerprinting]]: determine the [[operating system|OS]] of the victim host and its network adapter.

* Kill a connection: killing connections of choice from the connections-list.

* Passive scanning of the [[local area network|LAN]]: retrieval of information about hosts on the LAN, their open [[TCP and UDP port|ports]], the version numbers of available [[network service|services]], the type of the host ([[gateway (computer networking)|gateway]], [[router (computing)|router]] or simple [[personal computer|PC]]) and estimated distances in number of [[Hop (telecommunications)|hop]]s.

* Hijacking of [[Domain Name System|DNS]] requests.

Ettercap also has the ability to actively or passively find other poisoners on the LAN.
