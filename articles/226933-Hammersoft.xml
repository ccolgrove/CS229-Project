'''RTÃ Two''' ({{lang-ga|RTÃ a DÃ³}}) is a free-to-air general entertainment channel operated by Irish state broadcaster [[RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann]]. RTÃ Two is available throughout the island of Ireland through digital terrestrial service [[Saorview]], [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands, and is also available via [[satellite television|satellite]] ([[DVB-S]]) to Irish subscribers of [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]]. The channel also broadcasts in [[high-definition television|High Definition]] through '''RTÃ Two HD'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clover&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/07/15/rte-details-new-dtt-proposals/|title=RTÃ details new DTT proposals|last=Clover|first=Julian|date=15 July 2010|publisher=Broadband TV News|accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This channel launched on [[May 27]], 2011.

==History==
In the 1970s the Irish government considered three options for the introduction of a second television service: the re-transmission of [[BBC1 Northern Ireland]]; authorization of an independent commercial service; or charging RTÃ with the establishment of a second national channel. It was the last of these that was finally chosen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1970s.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Rte2lar1978.png|thumb|left|150px|The first logo for RTÃ 2]]

The channel began transmissions on 2 November 1978 and became [[Ireland]]'s fifth TV service after BBC One NI (1955), UTV(1959), RTÃ One (1961) and BBC Two (1964) and the Republic of Ireland's second channel. The opening broadcast was a gala ceremony from Cork. Owing to a technical fault, audio from [[BBC2]] was played during the countdown instead of the proper soundtrack, and when the channel commenced programmes, there was no audio for the initial 15 seconds or so. At first the new channel broadcast in the evenings only.

===RTÃ 2 (1978â1988)===
60% of the Republic of Ireland could receive UK channels via spillover or via cable. Cable in the republic was only permitted in areas of spillover up to the mid 1980s, to provide viewers with better reception of channels they could already receive over the air. Hence RTÃ Two was aimed at those that did not have the UK channels. To this end one of their main remits was the re-broadcasting of UK programming to Irish Audiences, that would not otherwise be seen on RTÃ 1. Coronation Street aired on the channel simultaneously with ITV's broadcasts of the programme (this continued until 1992 when it was put on RTÃ 1 due to the [[Olympic Games]] coverage). It broadcast much live programming from the [[BBC]] and [[ITV]]. However the channel in its initial format was not considered a success. 

The channel was also there for Irish speakers who were still looking for a television channel in the Irish language. ''[[CursaÃ­]]'' a current affair programme air on the channel until the mid-1990s. Other Irish language shows included the schools quiz ''Eureka'' and ''Scaoil Amach an BobailÃ­n'' with [[SeÃ¡n BÃ¡n Breathnach]]. 

However by 1987 RTÃ 2 was beginning to rebrand, RTÃ had relaunch with a new logo and both RTÃ 1 and 2 this year had similar idents. While the rebrand was a small success for both channels it was felt that RTÃ 2 and RTÃ 1 needed more specific audiences, RTÃ 2 at this stage was becoming more and more associated with youth orientated programming and sports programming (especially as UK channels were becoming more and more available across the country). In 1988 the majority of sporting and children's programming was moved to Network 2, the new name for RTÃ 2.

=== Network 2 (1988â1997) ===
In September 1988, RTÃ2 was given a major revamp and became Network 2. In addition to the launch of a new vivid red, blue, and green logo, the channel now came on air at 14:30. ''[[The Den (television)|The Den]]'' was moved to the channel, along with most youth and children's programming. ''[[Jo Maxi]]'' was launched as the youth strand. ''Sports Stadium'' took up the entire Saturday afternoon schedule, and all sports programming was aired on the channel, along with [[Irish language]] programming. A late night news bulletin, [[RTÃ News on Two|Network News]], which was followed by the controversial chat show come soap opera ''[[Nighthawks (TV series)|Nighthawks]]'' presented by [[Shay Healy]].
[[Image:Net21st88.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The first logo for Network 2.]]

This relaunch was a big success, and Network 2 remained stable until the mid-1990s. A new logoâreferring to the channel as RTÃ Network Two (though the &quot;RTÃ&quot; part was not referred to by announcers)âwas launched with the new RTÃ logo in 1995. By this time, RTÃ Network Two broadcast from mid-morning onwards, with educational programmes during the day. Also during this era, the channel experimented with late night broadcasts at weekends, under the ''[[The End (television)|The End]]'' brand, anchored by [[Barry Murphy (comedian)|Barry Murphy]] and [[Sean Moncrieff]].
[[Image:Network294.png|thumb|left|150px|Logo for Network 2 September 1995âOctober 1997.]]

===N2 (1997â2004)===
There was another major revamp in 1997, the channel was visually rebranded as &quot;N2&quot;, though announcers continued to refer to &quot;Network 2&quot;. N2 brought about perhaps as big a change as the original relaunch, RTÃ branding was dropped from the station almost completely, with home produced programmes now being referred to as &quot;N2 Productions&quot; (foreign imports were &quot;N2 Presentations&quot;). A futuristic logo along with a series of unusual graphical [[television ident|idents]] were developed. In-vision announcing returned. More importantly, the channel's line-up was completely refreshed. The late night schedule was completely revamped, with the launch of ''News 2''âa tailored bulletin for young peopleâfollowed by a talk show, ''[[Later On 2]]''. Monday nights became comedy nights, with the launch of home-produced comedy such as ''[[Don't Feed The Gondolas]]''. Elsewhere theme nights became a regular fixture, particularly on Fridays and Saturdays. ''The Den'' was now broadcast all day until 18:00 and was renamed ''Den 2''.
[[Image:N2-1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|One of the many logo innovations for N2 from 1997â2004]]
Not all the changes were universally welcomed, with the &quot;N2&quot; era, RTÃ cancelled its long running Saturday sports programme, ''[[Sports Stadium]]'' in 1997. Since then, RTÃ has not regularly aired live sports (or at least, as part of a regular schedule) on Saturday afternoons, though major events are still covered.

Many of the innovations of the N2 era had faded out by 2003. The idents had been replaced by simpler creations, the in-vision continuity had been scrapped again. ''[[Later On 2]]'' had more-or-less ended (one of the strands continues as ''The View'' on [[RTÃ One]]). In September 2003, News 2 reverted to the regular RTÃ News format (as [[RTÃ News on Two]]).

From September 2003, continuity announcers and trailers began to refer to the channel by the fuller title of &quot;RTÃ Network Two&quot;, in line with a new RTÃ initiative to promote the corporate branding. The main channel [[television ident|idents]] never changed, and said merely &quot;N2&quot; (although a newly-introduced on-screen [[Digital On-screen Graphics|DOG]] said &quot;RTÃ N2&quot;.). And finally in 2004 Network 2 was relaunched as RTÃ Two, in line with its sister channel RTÃ One.

===RTÃ Two (2004- )===
[[Image:Rtetwo2009.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Venus Flytrap]] logo from 2009âdate, RTÃ Two's green room look from 2004]]

RTÃ decided that the channel needed another revamp to keep it fresh. The channel's name reverted to RTÃ Two on the morning of 2 October 2004, with a themed evening of programmes called &quot;Farewell Network 2&quot; beginning at 20:00, featuring [[Podge and Rodge]] (see ''[[The Den (television)|The Den]]''). The new logo is similar in style to the current [[RTÃ One]] logo. The new branding is designed to promote the Irishness of the station, green is the dominant colour. New strands were developed. In particular, the number of Irish made programmes has increased, though some of this is made up of a new strand of early evening repeats. The idents from this time were based on a Green Room theme.

The latest change has been a complete rebrand and relaunch of ''[[The Den (television)|The Den]]'', on Saturday 17 September 2005, with the id Two strand becoming ''[[TTV (RTÃ)|TTV]]'' on the following Monday. In September 2009 TTV relaunched as ''Two Tube''.

RTÃ Two got a new look on 17 September 2009. The new idents were created by RTÃ Graphic Design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/tv/ident_rtetwo.html&lt;/ref&gt;


Continuing with the corporate branding of RTÃ radio and Television stations RTÃ TWO's iconic children's brand ''The Den'' ended on the 20 of September 2010. ''The Den'' was replaced by [[TRTÃ]], while ''Den Tots'' was replaced by [[RTÃjr]], this was due mainly to the on set of digital TV on which RTÃjr is available as a separate channel. Two Tube remains as the teenage block of programming. RTÃ Two continues to air a block of programming from RTÃjr.

==RTÃ Two HD==
'''RTÃ Two HD''' launched on [[Saorview]] on 27 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saorview.ie/channels-services/&lt;/ref&gt; The service broadcasts sporting programming from national to international events, documentaries, movies and US programming in high-definition.

==Programming==
RTÃ Two's main emphasis is on programmes for children and young people together with sports and acquired imported programmes. The channel's children's strand is called [[RTÃjr]]/[[TRTÃ]], known from 1986 to 2010 as ''[[The Den (television)|The Den]]'', runs from 06:00 to 17:30 each weekday, followed by its youth strand, ''[[Two Tube]]'' (formerly ''[[TTV (RTÃ)|TTV]]'' and ''[[iD (television)|iD Two]]'') from 17:30 to 19:00. ''[[RTÃ News on Two]]'' airs each weekday after 22:45. Much of RTÃ's programming for 2 - 6 year olds will move to a separtate channel [[RTÃjr]], while it is expected that [[TRTÃ]] will replace [[RTÃjr]]'s hours on RTÃ Two on [[Saorview]] when Analogue signals are replaced by Digital Terrestrial Television [[DTT]] in 2012. 

The channel also has a number of other strands, including ''Two Wild'', ''Two Extreme'', and ''RTÃ Sport on Two''. Films are also regularly aired on the channel especially European cinema and International cinema.                   

After 19:00, RTÃ Two airs its primetime lineup. This includes such imported shows as ''[[CSI: NY]]'', ''[[CSI: Miami]]'', ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''[[The Event]]''  etc., and such home-produced shows as ''Livin' with Lucy'', ''Fade Street'', ''The Model Scouts'', ''The Republic of Telly'' and ''Wagon's Den''. RTÃ Two also airs premier movies under the name ''SCREEN TWO'' and has first run rights to [[Rugby union in Ireland|Irish rugby]] and [[Association football in the Republic of Ireland|football]]. The channel has a reputation for airing many US shows such as before any other networks in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Network 2 must find new Friends  | url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2004/05/30/story762232538.asp# | work=Sunday Business Post | date=2004-05-30 | accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Channel 6 rebranded by owner TV3 as 3e | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0105/1230936655682.html | work=The Irish Times | date=2009-01-05 | accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commissioning Editor===
During the time of the 1997 rebrand of the channel as N2 they had placed the Head of Schedule as &quot;controller&quot; of the channel. Up to then channel was run side by side RTÃ One under RTÃ Television. Andrew Burns was head hunted from [[Border Television]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvpresenters.thetvroomplus.com/channel-23.html|title=ITV Presenters|publisher=The TV Room|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; were he had successful moved from [[Continuity Announcer|continuity announcing]] to TV management in 1996. N2 was a successful relaunched of the channel in the late 1990s however due to allegations of bullying by Andrew Burns towards one of the channels continuity announcers he was forced to resign from his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20020120/ai_n9709237/|title=I didn't go off the rails when I quit RTÃ|last=Tallant|first=Nicola|date=20 January 2002|publisher=BNET|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Fitzpatrick was then poached to take control of RTÃ scheduling from TV3 however N2 pretty much reverted to being part of the over all RTÃ Television structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iolfree.ie/~icdg/news_310301d.htm|title=New controller at RTÃ N2|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2011 it was announced by RTÃ that Eddie Doyle was given the position of Commissioning Editor at RTÃ Two. Eddie Doyle was RTÃ Commission Editor of Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/news/?act1=record&amp;only=1&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4283909&amp;tpl=archnews&amp;force=1|title=Eddie Doyle is New Commission Editor for RTÃ Two|date=19 May 2011|publisher=IFTN.ie|accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imported programming===
====1978â1988====
RTÃ Two was original set up to provide Irish viewers with retransmission of BBC and ITV programming. In 1978 it introduced a simulcast of many British programmes including ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Other UK shows included ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]'', ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'', ''[[Never the Twain]]'', ''[[Treasure Hunt]]'' and ''[[Wogan]]'' and American shows such as ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'', ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Crazy Like a Fox]]'' and ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]''. They also broadcast the Australian soap opera ''[[A Country Practice]]''. In 1988 RTÃ did a major revamp of the service, focusing more on Sports, Children's TV, Irish Programming as RTÃ 2 was still behind both [[UTV]] and [[BBC 1 Northern Ireland|BBC One NI]] in the ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvlistings.thetvroomplus.com/?id=6:ca|title=RTÃ Two TV Listings|last=The TV Room|pages=12|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1988â1993====
As Network 2 the service still focused strongly on imported programming, RTÃ would now look to have first runs of US programming before other European networks. In the early years Network 2 broadcast US sit-coms Monday to Friday at 21:00 such as ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd]]'', ''[[Check it Out! (Canadian TV series)|Check It Out]]'' and ''[[Murphy Brown]]''. They also broadcast ''[[Knots Landing]]'' and  ''[[Falcon Crest]]''. They also began broadcasting the long running Australian soap opera ''[[Home and Away]]'', while ''[[A Country Practice]]'' moved to RTÃ One. In 1992 ''Coronation Street'' moved to RTÃ One. Other US shows at this time included ''[[Head of the Class]]'', ''[[Ferris Bueller]]'' and ''[[Eerie Indiana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvlistings.thetvroomplus.com/?id=6:ca|title=RTÃ Network Two TV Listings|last=The TV Room|pages=4|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1993â1997====
During the 1990s Network 2 began to expand it schedule to cover morning and late night television. Imports still played a major part of the schedule with first showings of popular 1990s TV such as ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[The X Files]]'', ''[[Nowhere Man (TV series)|Nowhere Man]]'', ''[[My So-Called Life]]'', but also Late Night and Daytime repeats of ''[[Yes Minister]]'', ''[[The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[MacGyver]]'' and also the morning strand of ''[[Open University]]''. At 18:00 they began show many US teen sit-coms such as ''[[California Dreams]]'', ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' and ''[[Harry and the Hendersons]]''.

====1997â2004====
During the late 1990s the schedules began to increase in size again. All of the daytime repeat programmes were replaced by Children's television while Late Night TV was extended until 2am each morning with shows like, ''[[Profiler (TV series)|Profiler]]'', ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', ''[[Stargate SG1]]'' and some Australian serials including ''[[Water Rats (TV series)|Water Rats]]'' and ''[[Murder Call]]''. In 2001 they began broadcasting the Australian teen soap ''[[Neighbours]]''. Popular prime time US programmes included ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[Jessie]]'', ''[[Frasier]]'' and ''[[Boston Public]]''. In 2000 Network 2 broadcast all episodes of the cult favourite ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'' and finished the series before [[NBC]] did in the US. During this time they also began airing ''[[The Simpsons]]'' which had not be seen on the channel since ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' in the late 1980s.

===Reality TV===
During the last decade like many other TV channels RTÃ Two have had several reality based TV shows.

In 2003 Network 2 set out to find their news TV presenter in a reality show called ''[[The Selection Box]]'', the eventual winner was [[Caroline Morahan]]. In more recent years they have produced a similar children's series for The Den called ''[[It's My Show]]''.

RTÃ Two also produced two series of the employment reality show ''[[No Experience Required]]'', three prospective candidates are evaluated over the course of a week for a vacant position in a top company, the show follows them through interview stages and tasks set out by their prospective employees. A spin off series entitled ''[[No Experience Require]]'' [[transition years]] was produced for a younger school going audiences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/tv/noexperiencerequired/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 RTÃ Two broadcast ''[[Hollywood Trials]]''. It follow a group of young actors traveling to make it big in LA. The actors where selected by Hollywood acting guru [[Margie Haber]]. Those selected to travel with Margie to LA included [[Chris Newman (actor)|Chris Newman]] from the RTÃ Two drama ''Love is the Drug'', [[George McMahon (actor)|George McMahon]] from RTÃ One soap opera ''[[Fair City]]'' and [[Michael Graham (singer)|Michael Graham]] of [[Boyzone]] fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/tv/hollywoodtrials/cast.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hollywood Trials'' was then followed by ''[[The Model Agent]]''. The model agent in question was [[Ellis]] and with help of [[Erin O'Connor]] as the girls mentor she picked Carrie-Anne Burton for a contract with [[Independent Models]], one of the world's leading modeling agencies and a cover for [[Image magazine]], one of the Ireland's most high profile and respected fashion titles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rte.ie/tv/themodelagent/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; A similar series called ''[[The Model Scouts]]'' is currently in production.

''[[Do the Right Thing (Irish TV series)|Do the Right Thing]]'' is a reality series which began in September 2010 and is hosted by Lucy Kennedy and Baz Ashmawy, in search of the Ireland's ultimate [[volunteer]]. 

In 2011 ''[[Masterchef Ireland]]'' began airing on the channel two nights a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 21:30.

RTÃ Two also ran spin off serials to RTÃ One's reality shows, such as ''[[You're A Star]] Uncut'', ''[[Cabin Fever (TV series)|Cabin Fever]]'', and ''[[Treasure Island]] Uncovered''.

===Drama===
In the first two decades of RTÃ Two little original drama was produce for the channel; often RTÃ would just repeat their dramas on the channel such as ''[[Fair City]]'' and ''[[Glenroe]]''. RTÃ did place some emphasis on [[short film]] in the RTÃ Two series ''Short Cuts''. Short Films remain on RTÃ Two most Monday nights at 11:30; these shorts are not just taken from RTÃ co-financed productions but also from independent producers around the world.

RTÃ Two's most successful drama was a drama/comedy/chat show entitled ''[[Nighthawks]]'' presented by Shay Healy. This was produced as a pseudo-documentary about the behind the scenes of the television production, it featured many well known Irish comedians, however unlike the [[mockumentary]] ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', ''Nighthawks'' featured real interviews and was created by David Blake Knox, who went on to be controller of Network 2 until 1998. Gerry Ryan had a similar format show called ''Gerry Ryan Tonight'' during the 1990s.

====Drama 2000-2008====

From 2000 to 2008 RTÃ were committed to providing new and original drama on RTÃ Two each Monday night each autumn. The dramas had mixed reviews but they included ''[[Paths to Freedom]]'' (2000), ''[[Bachelors Walk (TV series)|Bachelors Walk]]'' (2001â2003), ''The Big Bow Wow'' (2003), ''[[Pure Mule]]'' (2004), ''[[Love is the Drug (TV series)|Love is the Drug]]'' (2004) and ''[[Prosperity (TV series)|Prosperity]]'' (2007). ''[[Raw (television series)|Raw]]'' was RTÃ Two's last Monday night drama; it received mixed reviews but it reached on average 250,000 viewers each week against RTÃ One's ''Prime Time Investigates'' and TV3's''The Apprentice''; Raw's second series ran on [[RTÃ One]]. Most of RTÃ Two's drama output was aimed at a younger audience than that of RTÃ One's and it often contained bad language and sex scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/raws-racy-sex-scenes-failing-to-rattle-viewers-1475229.html|title=Raw's racy sex scenes failing to rattle viewers|last=Horan|first=Niamh|date=14 September 2008|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/STAY+OUT+OF+MY+CHURCH;+Priest+bans+Love+Is+The+Drug+actors+after+RTE...-a0127331056|title=Priest bans Love Is The Drug actors after RTE 'disgrace'|last=Flanagan|first=Pat|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÃ ended their RTÃ Two drama's in 2008 with the first season of Raw, choosing to air its second season on RTÃ One. RTÃ are not currently looking for drama specifically for RTÃ Two which brings to an end a significant amount of work brought to the channel from RTÃ's drama department and independent producers. Many of the dramas of this era on RTÃ Two were seen as experimental but also highly modern and innovative.

===Comedy===
Monday night has been comedy night on RTÃ Two since its 1997 re-launch. Many US sitcoms were intermixed with live Irish comedy such as ''[[Don't Feed The Gondalas]] (DFTG)'', ''[[The Panel (Irish TV series)|The Panel]]'', ''[[The Podge and Rodge Show]]'', ''[[A Scare at Bedtime]] with Podge and Rodge'', ''@LastTV'', ''The Liffey Laughs'', ''[[The Blizzard of Odd]]'', ''[[The Byrne Ultimatum]]'' and ''[[Night Live]]''.

From 1997 to 2010 The Den ran for 10 hours a day starting at 07:00 to 17:00 followed by teenage strands iD, TTV and Two Tube. RTÃ choose to rebrand their children's strands in 2010 effectively axing Ireland's longest running children's TV show. [[TRTÃ]] and [[RTÃjr]] will begin airing from 20 September 2010. 

Saturday programming came from [[RTÃ Cork]] in form the mid-1990s to the late-2000s, starting with ''The Swamp'' which took the place of classic Irish Children's TV such as ''[[Pajo's Junkbox]]'', ''[[Scratch Saturday]]'' and ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (which broadcast on [[RTÃ One]]). ''[[Satitude]]'' was RTÃ Cork's main TV show for children and was broadcast on [[The Den (television)|The Den]] on RTÃ Two on Saturday mornings. Satitude was cancelled in 2009.
