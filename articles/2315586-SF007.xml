This type of music particularly flourished around [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]] and [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], in the 14th and 15th centuries. The name can be roughly translated as &quot;peculiar/unconventional dance.&quot; Although dance was originally involved with the performance, it was of minor importance, and probably involved the performer simply stamping the beat.

==Noh==
It has been said that the [[shirabyÅshi]] culture greatly influenced [[Noh]] drama with this unorthodox form of dancing by introducing it to Noh. The playwright [[Kanami]] incorporated it as part of the formation of his famous [[Noh]] theatre style.
