'''Wohlthat Mountains''' is a large group of associated [[mountain]] features consisting of the [[Humboldt Mountains]], [[Petermann Ranges]], and the [[Gruber Mountains]], located immediately east of the [[Orvin Mountains]] in [[Fimbulheimen]] in the central [[Queen Maud Land]]. Discovered by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938â1939), led by Capt. [[Alfred Ritscher]], and named for [[Councilor of state]] [[Helmuth C.H. Wohlthat]], who as economist and fiscal officer dealt with the organization of the expedition.

The area was reconnoitered and aerially photographed by the 5th Indian Antarctic Expedition (Nov 1985-Mar 1986) with a three month temporary summer camp established there. The area was revisited by later Indian Antarctic expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Breaking the ice in Antarctica: the first Indian wintering in Antarctica |last=Sharma |first=Satya S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=New Age International |location= |isbn=9788122412901 |page= |pages=323 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=emCd_27imFoC |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
