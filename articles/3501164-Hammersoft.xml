'''Cain Dingle''' is a [[fictional character]] in the British [[ITV]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Emmerdale]]'' played by [[Jeff Hordley]]. 

==Creation and casting==
In 2000 series producer Kieran Roberts introduced three new members of the [[Dingle family]]. The new characters were introduced to the regular cast in 2000, who first arrived at the funeral of [[Butch Dingle]] ([[Paul Loughran]]). Among them were Cain ([[Jeff Hordley]]) son of [[Zak Dingle]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]) and [[Faith Dingle]] (Gillian Jephcott). Cain's cousin and one-time lover [[Charity Dingle]] ([[Emma Atkins]]), and Zak's brother [[Shadrach Dingle|Shadrach]] ([[Andy Devine (English actor)|Andy Devine]]). &lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.emmerdale.org/emmerdale/dingles/cain/cain.htm|title=Emmerdale's Cain Dingle|publisher=Emmerdale Org|author=Emmerdale Org|date=3 April 2004|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006 it was announced that Jeff Hordley had quit, however the door had been left open for a possible return in the future. Cain's final scenes aired in September 2006. His storyline saw Cain bow out of the serial drama following the character's successful kidnap and extortion plot involving [[Tom King (Emmerdale)|Tom King]] ([[Ken Farrington]]) and [[Sadie King]] ([[Patsy Kensit]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|last=Green|first=Kris|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a31731/jeff-hordley-quits-emmerdale.html|title=Jeff Hordley quits 'Emmerdale'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=18 April 2006|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 it was announced that Cain Dingle would return to Emmerdale in April that year after a three-year break, his return storyline saw him support and help his daughter, [[Debbie Dingle]] ([[Charley Webb]]) who was being held on remand for the murder of PC [[Shane Doyle]] ([[Paul McEwan]]).&lt;ref name=quit&gt;{{citenews|last=Green|first=Kris |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a141846/cain-dingle-returns-to-emmerdale.html|title=Cain Dingle returns to 'Emmerdale'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=12 January 2009|accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to [[Digital Spy]] about his return, Hordley said &quot;I am really looking forward to returning to Emmerdale. The storylines that lead to Cainâs return are in keeping with his character and a perfect way to bring him back to the heart of the Dingle clan where he belongs&quot;.

As a teenager, Cain had a brief relationship with his cousin Charity and when Charity arrives in Emmerdale, Cain begins causing trouble for her. On hearing she is dating [[Chris Tate]], Cain hits her. After [[Paddy Kirk|Paddy]] and [[Emily Kirk]] foster [[Debbie Dingle|Debbie Jones]], she makes friends with the Dingles. She shows Cain a picture of her biological mother and when he sees Sam looking at old family pictures he realises Charity is her mother.

Cain becomes close to baby Sarah. Debbie makes it clear that she doesn't want to be a mother. Cain pressures her to face up to her responsibilities so she becomes desperate and persuades Emily to take Sarah with her when she leaves the village, angering the Dingles.

Cain and Sadie damage the King's River Show Home. Sadie refuses to sleep with Cain, infuriating him so he tells Jimmy that Sadie had paid him to trash the house and claimed they were having an affair. He and Jimmy plan to set her up. When Sadie confronts him, Cain said he would tell Matthew, that they were having an affair. Sadie hit back by telling Ashley that Cain was sleeping with Jasmine, resulting in the Dingles throwing Cain out and letting Debbie move back in. Cain leaves the village temporarily. The damage caused by Cain to the show house had damaged the gas pipes. Jimmy had them patched up, meaning to do a proper job later. Unfortunately gas built up in a cupboard and when sparked by an automatic light switch, the show house exploded, causing the deaths of [[Dawn Woods]], [[Noreen Bell]] and [[List of minor Emmerdale characters (2006)#David Brown|David Brown]]. Cain and Jimmy feel guilty for their part in the showhome explosion but Sadie showed no remorse. Feeling the need to be punished for what he'd done, he confessed to murdering his late sister-in-law, Alice, so Samson wouldn't lose both his parents. This act redeemed him with his family, even Debbie. He was bailed by Sadie, who sent money to Wishing Well cottage, which Zak and Shadrach surrendered at the hearing. Out on bail, Cain agrees to help Sadie get revenge on [[Tom King|Tom]] and [[Matthew King]]. After learning the King's were millionaires, Cain and Sadie plotted to [[Major Storylines of Emmerdale#Tom King.2C Cain Dingle and Sadie King Kidnap Plot 2006|kidnap Tom]] for a large ransom. Sadie knew nobody would believe Cain was capable of murder so they planned to fake her death so Tom would co-operate. However, things didn't go to plan. Debbie tells Cain that Sadie had paid for Jasmine's abortion, leaving Cain furious. After a violent confrontation with Sadie, Cain follows her to the meeting place.

The police followed him to a quarry where Cain sidetracked them by sending his empty car over a cliff, making everyone think Tom and Sadie were inside. While the police searched the lake, Cain assaulted two policemen and disguised himself in a police uniform. After shooting Sadie, Cain forces Tom to phone Chastity to deliver the ransom. Debbie begs her father to take her with him, even suggesting she get Sarah back but they part in tears. Cain gave some of the ransom to an old lady, asking her to post it to Debbie. Cain was surprised by her honesty and realised he wanted to change. At the airport, Cain got into the plane alone, telling Sadie that he didn't want to be the same person he'd always been. Cain leaves Debbie a message on her voicemail, telling her to ignore what the others said, that he had left Sadie and that he loved Debbie more than he'd shown. On Debbie's 18th, he sends her an expensive silver watch.

Cain tells Maisie he had blackmailed Nathan and Natasha and they had paid him to keep quiet. Cain can't help Ryan without incriminating himself for fraud and blackmail. He attends Ryan's trial and after witnessing Nathans lie in the witness box he decided to take action. After making sure that Sam keeps quiet about the wallet during his witness testimony, Cain kidnaps Nathan. Cain holds him hostage in a disused barn. He threatens to kill Nathan if Ryan if foung guilty. Ryan is found guilty of the murder and Natasha soon after confessed. 

In April 2011 Cain, on the rebound after [[Charity Tate]] makes it clear that she has moved on and their relationship is over, has a [[one-night stand]] with troubled teenager [[Amy Wyatt]]. Cain immediately regrets it and rejects Amy the following day. However his troubles are far from over when Amy announces that she is pregnant with his child in August 2011. Cain bullies her into having an [[abortion]] but at the last minute Amy backs out of the termination and decides to keep her pregnancy a secret, lying that she went ahead with the procedure. Cain makes an enemy out of the Barton family, after having a passionate fling with [[Moira Barton]] and then revealing all to her devastated husband [[John Barton]] the following day. Amy later gives birth to their son Kyle alone in the graveyard in December 2011 and believing him to be dead, she panics and places him in the phonebox where he is discovered by [[Hazel Rhodes]].
