'''klik''' was a system for [[software]] [[download]] and usage on GNU/[[Linux]].

==Technology==
klik did not &quot;install&quot; software in the traditional sense (i.e., it did not put files all over the place in the system). It used one .cmg [[computer file|file]] per [[application software|application]]. Each one is self-contained: it includes all [[library (software)|libraries]] the application [[dependency (computer science)|depends]] on and that are not part of the base system. In this regard, it is similar to &quot;[[application virtualization]]&quot; or ''[[Portable application]]s''. One can ''klik'' a file even if they are not a [[superuser]], or they are using a [[live CD]].

klik integrated with web browsers on the user's computer. Users downloaded and installed software by typing a URL beginning with &lt;code&gt;klik://&lt;/code&gt;. This downloaded a klik &quot;recipe&quot; file, which was used to generate the .cmg file. In this way, one recipe could be used to supply packages to a wide variety of platforms.

klik files were often simpler than compiling and installing an application, as no installation actually took place. The .cmg file is a compressed image which is temporarily mounted to allow access to the program, but not having to extract the program or modify the underlying system. Currently only 8 klik programs can be run at once because of the limitation of mounting compressed images with the [[Linux kernel]], unless [[FUSE (Linux)|FUSE]] is used. The file is remounted each time the program is run, meaning the user can remove the program by simply deleting the .cmg file.

==Release history==
klik was designed in 2004 by Simon Peter. A next version, klik2, was in development; and would natively incorporate the FUSE kernel module, but it never reached past the beta stage. Since 2011 the project homepage ''klik.atekon.de'' is not reachable anymore, but a successor project named ''PortableLinuxApps'' with similar goals was started by the main developer.&lt;ref name=portableapps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portablelinuxapps.org/docs/1.0/AppImageKit.pdf |format=pdf |publisher=PortableLinuxApps.org |first=Simon| last=Peter |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-07-29 |title=AppImageKit Documentation 1.0 |pages=2â3|quote=''The AppImage format has been created with specific objectives in mind: Be Simple [...], Maintain binary compatibility [...], Be distribution-agnostic [...], Remove the need for installation [...], Allow to put apps anywhere [...], Do not require recompilation [...], Keep base operating system untouched [...], Do not require root [...]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
