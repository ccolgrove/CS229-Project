In 1990 he fled the country when the company owned by his brother [[Roberto Ahumada Kurtz|Roberto AnÃ­bal]] was accused of fraud against 900 senior citizens using a [[pyramid scheme]] in 1987&lt;ref name=&quot;Jornada&quot;&gt;http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2004/04/04/mas-najar.html April 4, 2004.

His company obtained a contract in 1994 to build two [[overpass]]es for the city of [[Acapulco]]. That same year he was imprisoned for 29 days for generic fraud.

He also obtained contracts for paving streets for the government of the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]] during the administration of [[Manuel Camacho SolÃ­s]] ([[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]) but it was until 1988 during the administration of the first-elected head of government, [[CuauhtÃ©moc CÃ¡rdenas]] (1997â99, [[Party of the Democratic Revolution|PRD]]) that  the number of contracts became significant. Under the administration of [[Rosario Robles]] (1999â2000, PRD) the number of contracts increased furthermore. In 2003 he obtained contracts for 370 million pesos in [[Ãlvaro ObregÃ³n, D.F.]] a borough of Mexico City administered by [[Luis Eduardo Zuno]], member of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|PAN]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Terra&quot;&gt;[http://www.terra.com.mx/noticias/articulo/131756/ ''Reconoce Ahumada red con polÃ­ticos''] March 31, 2004.

On June 10, 2003 Ahumada videotaped a conversation with [[RenÃ© Bejarano]], then local deputy in the congress of the Federal District and  former personal secretary of [[AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador]], [[Head of Government of the Federal District]] and failed presidential candidate representing the [[Party of the Democratic Revolution]] (PRD) in the [[Mexican general election, 2006|2006 elections]]. The conversation was then presented by [[Federico DÃ¶ring]], a politician belonging to the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN), on [[VÃ­ctor Trujillo]]'s high rated television talk show on March 3 of the same year. In the video, a faceless person was offering $45,000 in cash to Bejarano.&lt;ref name=&quot;La Voz&quot;&gt;[http://www.lavoz.com.ar/2004/0402/internacionales/nota232264_1.htm ''Los Ahumada defienden el origen de su fortuna''] April 2, 2004. Retrieved on February 17, 2006 from lavoz.com.ar {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bejarano then declared the funds were donations to the campaign of [[Leticia Robles ColÃ­n]], another PRD politician. When it was discovered the faceless person in the video was Ahumada, he declared that public servants of the government of the Federal District had been blackmailing him since at least the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terra2&quot;/&gt;

Another video made public in the evening of March 3 showed a conversation between Ahumada and Bejarano where the first complains about non-payments by the Federal District government to Quart. Bejarano then promises to speak with LÃ³pez Obrador about the issue and to remind him that Ahumada has financed the campaigns of several PRD members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terra3&quot;&gt;[http://www.terra.com.mx/noticias/articulo/130119/ ''Video revela ayuda de Bejarano a Ahumada''] March 3, 2004.

This incident and another video of similar content were labeled ''[[videoscandals]]'' by the press. Carlos Ahumada then flew to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] entering the country on February 27 with a Mexican passport. Days later, on March 12 [[Interpol]] notified the [[government of Cuba]] that Ahumada was wanted in Mexico to respond to criminal charges, he was detained on March 30. The [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|government of Mexico]] through its ambassador in Cuba, [[Roberta Lajous]], initiated the process of extradition the next day and on April 28 of the same year Ahumada was deported to Mexico City where he remained imprisoned until May 7, 2007 when he was acquitted of all charges.

On July 8, 2007 Ahumada and his family left Mexico and returned to the land of his birth, Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carlosahumada.com/html/biografia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahumada repeatedly claimed a conspiracy headed by ex-president [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] seeking to &quot;banish [[AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador]] off the Presidential Ballot&quot;, which implicated Attorney General [[Rafael Macedo de la Concha]], Secretary of the Interior [[Santiago Creel]] and senator [[Diego FernÃ¡ndez de Cevallos]]. This conspiracy is also denounced on a video that appeared later.

Bejarano renounced his membership in the PRD &lt;ref name=&quot;Terra4&quot;&gt;[http://www.terra.com.mx/noticias/formato.asp?articuloid=130115&amp;paginaid=1&amp;formatoId=2 ''Renuncia Bejarano a militancia del PRD''] March 3, 2004.
