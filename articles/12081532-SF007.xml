'''SkoleSYS''' is a [[GPL]] licensed, free [[student information system]] developed to target small schools with limited financial resources. The project features a mainserver which acts as gateway, file server and user account database. The system is built for ([[Kubuntu|k]])[[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] based distributions but should not be difficult to implement support for other [[Linux distribution]]s.

==SkoleSYS Features==

There are three [[debian]] packages skolesys-seeder, skolesys-mainserver, skolesys-client. The seeder is an intermidiate package which is used to install on new hosts and then execute one of following: ss_seed_mainserver, ss_seed_ltspserver, ss_seed_workstation. skolesys-client is used for both [[Linux Terminal Server Project|LTSP]] servers and workstations as they are both clients of a mainserver.

SkoleSYS is '''not''' a [[learning management system]] (LMS), such as [[Moodle]].
