==History==
{{Main|History of Dell}}
Dell traces its origins to 1984, when [[Michael Dell]] created ''PCs Limited'' while a student at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. The dorm-room headquartered company sold [[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC-compatible]] computers built from stock components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/about_dell/company/history/history?~ck=ln&amp;c=at&amp;l=de&amp;lnki=0&amp;s=corp |title=About Dell&amp;#124;History &amp;#124; Dell Ãsterreich |publisher=Euro.dell.com |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell dropped out of school in order to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $300,000 in expansion-capital from his family.

In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design, the &quot;Turbo PC&quot;, which sold for US$795.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koehn |first=Nancy Fowler |title=Brand New: How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers' Trust from Wedgwood to Dell |publisher=[[Harvard Business Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=9781578512218 |page=287 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=7j8VefeqUk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=October 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCs Limited advertised its systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. The company [[gross profit|grossed]] more than $73&amp;nbsp;million in its first year of operation.

The company changed its name to &quot;Dell Computer Corporation&quot; in 1988 and began expanding globally. In June 1988, Dell's market capitalization grew by $30&amp;nbsp;million to $80&amp;nbsp;million from its June 22 [[initial public offering]] of 3.5&amp;nbsp;million shares at $8.50 a share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/investor/en/faqs?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp Frequently Asked Questions]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]]'' included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's [[Fortune Global 500|500]] largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In 1996, Dell began selling computers through its website, and in 2002, it expanded its product line to include televisions, [[handhelds]], digital audio players, and [[Printer (computing)|printers]]. Dell's first [[business acquisition|acquisition]] occurred in 1999 with the purchase of ConvergeNet Technologies. In 2003, the company was rebranded as simply &quot;Dell Inc.&quot; to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers. 

From 2004 to 2007, Michael Dell stepped aside as CEO, while long-time Dell employee [[Kevin Rollins]] took the helm. During that time, Dell acquired [[Alienware]], which introduced several new items to Dell products, including [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] microprocessors. To prevent cross-market products, Dell continues to run Alienware as a separate entity, but still a wholly owned subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 29, 2008|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2006/tc20060323_034268.htm|title=Dell Goes High-end and Hip |publisher=McGraw-Hill|work=BusinessWeek |date=March 23, 2006|author=Lee, Louise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lackluster performance, however, in its lower-end computer business prompted Michael Dell to take on the role of CEO again. The founder announced a change campaign called &quot;Dell 2.0,&quot; reducing headcount and diversifying the company's product offerings. The company acquired EqualLogic on January 28, 2008 to gain a foothold in the [[iSCSI]] storage market. Because Dell already had an efficient manufacturing process, integrating EqualLogic's products into the company drove manufacturing prices down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 29, 2008|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/desktop/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=202802668|title=Dell's EqualLogic Buy Could Drive Down iSCSI Storage Prices |work=InformationWeek|publisher=United Business Media|date=November 5, 2007|author=Gonsalves, Antone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manufacturing====
From its early beginnings, Dell operated as a pioneer in the &quot;configure to order&quot; approach to manufacturingâdelivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications. In contrast, most PC manufacturers in those times delivered large orders to intermediaries on a quarterly basis.&lt;ref&gt;Dedrick and Kraemer: [http://pcic.merage.uci.edu/papers/2007/MarketMaking.pdf &quot;Market Making in the PC Industry&quot;], Personal Computing Industry Center, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

To minimize the delay between purchase and delivery, Dell has a general policy of manufacturing its products close to its customers. This also allows for implementing a [[just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] (JIT) manufacturing approach, which minimizes [[inventory]] costs. Low inventory is another signature of the Dell business modelâa critical consideration in an industry where components depreciate very rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer and Dedrick: &quot;Dell Computer: Organization of a Global Production Network&quot;, Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell's manufacturing process covers assembly, software installation, functional testing (including &quot;burn-in&quot;), and quality control. Throughout most of the company's history, Dell manufactured desktop machines in-house and contracted out manufacturing of base notebooks for configuration in-house.&lt;ref&gt;Company Annual Reports, various years.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company's approach has changed. The 2006 Annual Report states &quot;we are continuing to expand our use of original design manufacturing partnerships and manufacturing outsourcing relationships.&quot; ''The Wall Street Journal'' reported in September, 2008 that &quot;Dell has approached contract computer manufacturers with offers to sell&quot; their plants.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, J: &quot;Dell Plans to Sell Factories in Effort to Cut Costs&quot;, ''Wall Street Journal'', September 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembly of desktop computers for the North American market formerly took place at Dell plants in [[Austin, Texas]] (original location) and [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] (opened in 1999). Dell's plant in Austin was shut down in 2008. It closed its desktop manufacturing in Lebanon in early 2009. The plant in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] (opened in 2005) is scheduled to cease operations in November 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/09/13/daily2.html | title=Dell closes N.C. manufacturing plant | date=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is expected that most of the work carried out in North Carolina will be transferred to contract manufacturers in Asia and Mexico, though Dell said some of the work will move to its own factories overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/technology/2009/10/08/1008Dell.html |title=Dell closing its last large U.S. plant |publisher=Austin American-Statesman |date=October 8, 2009 |author=Kirk Ladendorf |accessdate=Nov 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Miami]], [[Florida]] facility of its [[Alienware]] subsidiary remains in operation. Dell servers come from Austin, Texas.

Dell assembles computers for the [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] market at [[Limerick]] in the Republic of Ireland, and employs about 4,500 people in that country. Dell began manufacturing in [[Limerick]] in 1991 and went on to become Ireland's largest exporter of goods and its second-largest company and foreign investor. On January 8, 2009, Dell announced that it would move all Dell manufacturing in Limerick to Dell's new plant in the Polish city of [[ÅÃ³dÅº]] by January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0108/Dell.html 1,900 jobs lost at Dell in Limerick]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}. RTÃ New Report&amp;nbsp;â January 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
[[European Union]] officials said they would investigate a â¬52.7million aid package the Polish government used to attract Dell away from Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0108/Dell1.html EU to investigate Dell aid package]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}. RTÃ New Report&amp;nbsp;â January 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; European Manufacturing Facility 1 (EMF1, opened in 1990) and EMF3 form part of the [[Raheen Industrial Estate]] near Limerick. EMF2 (previously a [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]] facility, later occupied by [[Flextronics]], situated in Castletroy) closed in 2002,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and Dell Inc. has consolidated production into EMF3 (EMF1 now{{When|date=January 2010}} contains only offices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/2000ire/IEP:_The_IE_Professional_No.250_5-17 |title=NY Transfer&amp;nbsp;â Since 1985, All the News That Doesn't Fit |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsidies from the Polish government did keep Dell for a long time. Manufacturing Facility in Lodz was sold to Foxconn as announced in Dec 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industryweek.com/articles/dell_to_sell_polish_plant_to_taiwans_foxconn_20540.aspx|title=Dell to Sell Polish Plant to Taiwan's Foxconn|author=Agence France-Presse|publisher=IndustryWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell's Alienware subsidiary also manufactures PCs in an Athlone, Ireland plant. Construction of EMF4 in [[ÅÃ³dÅº]], Poland has {{As of|2007|alt=started}}: Dell started production there in autumn 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.euro.Dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/emea/corporate/pressoffice/2006/uk/en/2006_09_18_brk_000?c=uk&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp |title=Dell Announces Manufacturing Facility In Poland To Serve Growing Central And Eastern European Markets |publisher=.euro.dell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell opened plants in Penang, [[Malaysia]] in 1995, and in Xiamen, China in 1999. These facilities serve the Asian market and assemble 95% of Dell notebooks. Dell Inc. has invested{{When|date=October 2009}} an estimated $60&amp;nbsp;million in a new manufacturing unit in [[Chennai]], India, to support the sales of its products in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Indian-made products will bear the &quot;Made in India&quot; mark. In 2007 the Chennai facility had the target of producing 400,000 desktop PCs, and plans envisaged it starting to produce notebook PCs and other products in the second half of 2007.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Dell moved desktop and PowerEdge server manufacturing for the South American market from the [[Eldorado do Sul, Brazil|Eldorado do Sul]] plant opened in 1999, to a new plant in [[HortolÃ¢ndia|Hortolandia, Brazil]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2001/2001_02_19_pa_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp Dell Starts Manufacturing Servers in Brazil]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical support==
Dell routes technical support queries according to component-type and to the level of support purchased:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell Services|url=http://www.dell.com/servicedescriptions|publisher=Dell Inc.|accessdate=June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Basic support provides business-hours telephone support and next business-day on-site support/ Return-to-Base, or Collect and Return Services (based on contracts purchased at point of sale) 
# Dell ProSupport provides 24x7x365 telephone and online support, a selection of 4 or 6-hour onsite support after telephone-based troubleshooting, and a Mission Critical option with two-hour onsite support, for customers who choose the highest level of support for their most critical hardware assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Dell.com/ProSupport |title=Support Services |publisher=Dell |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell's Consumer division offers 24x7 phone based and online troubleshooting in certain markets such as the United States and Canada. In 2008 Dell redesigned services-and-support for businesses with &quot;Dell ProSupport&quot;, offering customers more options to adapt services to fit their needs. Rather than take a one-size-fits-all approach, Dell allows various options for its customers. 

In addition, the company provides protection services, advisory services, multivendor hardware support, &quot;how-to&quot; support for software applications, collaborative support with many third-party vendors, and online parts and labor dispatching for customers who diagnose and troubleshoot their hardware. Dell also provides Dell ProSupport customers access to a crisis-center to handle major outages, or problems caused by natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell ProSupport on Dell.com|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/enterprise/d/services/support-services-global-command-center.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial aspects==
===Organization===
A board of directors of nine people runs the company. [[Michael Dell]], the founder of the company, serves as chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Other board members include [[Donald J. Carty|Don Carty]], [[William H. Gray (congressman)|William Gray]], [[Judy Lewent]], [[Klaus Luft]], [[Alex J. Mandl|Alex Mandl]], [[Michael A. Miles]], and [[Sam Nunn]]. [[Shareholder]]s elect the nine board members at [[meeting]]s, and those board members who do not get a majority of votes must submit a [[resignation]] to the board, which will subsequently choose whether or not to accept the resignation. The board of directors usually sets up five committees having oversight over specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues, including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposed mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters (including nomination of the board); and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws.

The corporate structure and management of Dell extends beyond the board of directors. The Dell Global Executive Management Committee sets [[Strategic management|strategic directions]]. Dell has regional senior vice-presidents for countries other than the United States, including David Marmonti for [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]] and Stephen J. Felice for Asia/Japan. {{As of|2007}}, other officers included Martin Garvin (senior vice president for worldwide procurement) and [[Susan Sheskey|Susan E. Sheskey]] (vice president and [[Chief Information Officer]]).

===Marketing===
Dell advertisements have appeared in several types of media including television, the Internet, magazines, [[Mail-order catalog|catalogs]] and newspapers. Some of Dell Inc's marketing strategies include lowering prices at all times of the year, offering free bonus products (such as Dell printers), and offering free shipping in order to encourage more sales and to stave off competitors. In 2006, Dell [http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm?chan=search cut its prices] in an effort to maintain its 19.2% market share. However, this also cut profit-margins by more than half, from 8.7 to 4.3 percent. To maintain its low prices, Dell continues to accept most purchases of its products via the Internet and through the telephone network, and to move its customer-care division to India and [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_03_20_ndi_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp Michael Dell Sees India Playing a Key Role in the Online World]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular United States television and print ad campaign in the early 2000s featured the actor [[Ben Curtis (actor)|Ben Curtis]] playing the part of &quot;Steven&quot;, a lightly mischievous blond-haired youth who came to the assistance of bereft computer purchasers. Each television advertisement usually ended with Steven's catch-phrase: &quot;Dude, you're gettin' a Dell!&quot;

A subsequent advertising campaign featured [[intern]]s at Dell headquarters (with Curtis' character appearing in a small cameo at the end of one of the first commercials in this particular campaign).

A Dell advertising campaign for the XPS line of gaming computers featured in print in the September 2006 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''. It used as a [[tagline]] the common term in Internet and [[gamer]] slang: &quot;FTW&quot;, meaning &quot;For The Win&quot;. However, Dell Inc. soon{{When|date=May 2009}} dropped the campaign.

In the [[first-person shooter]] game [[F.E.A.R. Extraction Point]], several computers visible on desks within the game have recognizable Dell XPS model characteristics, sometimes even including the Dell logo on the monitors.

In 2007, Dell switched advertising agencies in the US from [[BBDO]] to [[Working Mother]] Media. In July 2007, Dell released new advertising created by Working Mother to support the Inspiron and XPS lines. The ads featured music from the [[The Flaming Lips|Flaming Lips]] and [[Devo]] who re-formed especially to record the song in the ad &quot;Work it Out&quot;. Also in 2007, Dell began using the slogan &quot;Yours is here&quot; to say that it customizes computers to fit customers' requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;engadget&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/11/21/dell-launches-star-studded-yours-is-here-ad-campaign/|title=Dell launches star-studded &quot;Yours Is Here&quot; ad campaign|work=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Dell partner program====
In late 2007, Dell Inc. announced that it planned to expand its program to [[value-added reseller]]s (VARs), giving it the official name of &quot;Dell Partner Direct&quot; and a new Website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Partner Direct | publisher=Dell  | accessdate =June 13, 2011 | url = http://partner.Dell.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms of marketing of laptop security====
In 2008, Dell received press coverage over its claim of having the world's most secure laptops, specifically, its Latitude D630 and Latitude D830.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2220173/Dell-scolded-laptop-ads Dell Scolded for Laptop Ads]&lt;/ref&gt; At Lenovo's request, the (U.S.) National Advertising Division (NAD) evaluated the claim, and reported that Dell did not have enough evidence to support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitaldaily.allthingsd.com/20080623/dont-worry-Dell-your-laptops-are-still-the-worlds-ugliest/ |title=Dell's Claim as World's Most Secure Commercial Laptops? |publisher=Digitaldaily.allthingsd.com |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail===
Dell first opened their retail stores in India.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech.fortune.cnn.com&quot;/&gt;

====United States====
In the early 1990s, Dell sold its products through [[Best Buy]], [[Costco]] and [[Sam's Club]] stores in the United States. Dell stopped this practice in 1994, citing low profit-margins on the business. In 2003, Dell briefly sold products in [[Sears]] stores in the U.S. In 2007, Dell started shipping its products to major retailers in the U.S. once again, starting with [[Sam's Club]] and [[Wal-Mart]]. [[Staples Inc.|Staples]], the largest office-supply retailer in the U.S., and [[Best Buy]], the largest electronics retailer in the U.S., became Dell retail partners later that same year.

=====Kiosks=====
Starting in 2002, Dell opened [[kiosk]] locations in shopping malls across the United States in order to give personal service to customers who preferred this method of shopping to using the Internet or the telephone-system. Despite the added expense, prices at the kiosks match or beat prices available through other retail channels. Starting in 2005, Dell expanded [[kiosk]] locations to include shopping malls across [http://www.Dell.com.au/Delldirectstore Australia], [http://www.Dell.ca/Delldirectstore Canada], [http://www1.ap.Dell.com/content/topics/topic.aspx/ap/topics/main/en/direct_kiosk?c=sg&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs Singapore] and Hong Kong.

On January 30, 2008, Dell shut down all 140 kiosks in the U.S. due to expansion into retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/press-releases/2008-01-30-00-direct-retail.aspx |title=Dell Focuses on Direct and Retail Business, Closes Kiosks in U.S |publisher=Content.dell.com |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 3, 2010, Dell had also shut down all of its mall kiosks in Australia. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2010/04/dell-closing-down-their-retail-kiosks-across-the-country/|title=Dell Closing Down Their Retail Kiosks Across The Country  |publisher=gizmodo.com |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Stores=====
In 2006, Dell Inc. opened one full store, {{convert|3000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} in area, at [[NorthPark Center]] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. It operates the retail outlet seven days a week to display about 36 models, including PCs and televisions. As at the kiosks, customers can only see demonstration-computers and place orders through agents. Dell then delivers purchased items just as if the customer had placed the order by phone or over the Internet.

In addition to showcasing products, the stores also support on-site warranties and non-warranty service (&quot;Dell Solution Station&quot;). Services offered include repairing computer video-cards and removing spyware from hard drives.

On February 14, 2008, Dell closed the Service Center in its Dallas NorthPark store and laid off all the technical staff there.{{cn|date=March 2011}}

====Elsewhere====
{{As of|2008|2|alt=As of the end of February 2008}}, Dell products shipped to one of the largest office-supply retailers in Canada, [[Staples Business Depot]]. In April 2008, [[Future Shop]] and [[Best Buy]] began carrying a subset of Dell products, such as certain desktops, laptops, printers, and monitors.

Since some shoppers in certain markets show reluctance to purchase technological products through the phone or the Internet, Dell has looked into opening retail operations in some countries in Central Europe and Russia. In April 2007, Dell opened a retail store in [[Budapest]]. In October of the same year, Dell opened a retail store in Moscow.

In the UK, [[HMV Group plc|HMV]]'s flagship [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]] store has sold Dell XPS PCs since December 2007. From January 2008 the UK stores of [[DSG International (retailer)|DSGi]] have sold Dell products (in particular, through [[Currys]] and [[PC World (retailer)|PC World]] stores). As of 2008, the large supermarket-chain [[Tesco]] has sold Dell laptops and desktops in outlets throughout the UK.

In May 2008, Dell reached an agreement with office supply chain, [[Officeworks]] (part of [[Coles Group]]), to stock a few modified models in the Inspiron desktop and notebook range. These models have slightly different model numbers, but almost replicate the ones available from the Dell Store. Dell continued its retail push in the Australian market with its partnership with [[Harris Technology]] (another part of Coles Group) in November of the same year. In addition, Dell expanded its retail distributions in Australia through an agreement with discount electrical retailer, [[The Good Guys (Australasia)|The Good Guys]], known for &quot;Slashing Prices&quot;. Dell agreed to distribute a variety of makes of both desktops and notebooks, including [[Studio]] and [[Dell XPS|XPS]] systems in late 2008. Dell and [[Dick Smith Electronics]] (owned by [[Woolworths Limited]]) reached an agreement to expand within Dick Smith's 400 stores throughout Australia and New Zealand in May 2009 (1 year since Officeworks&amp;nbsp;â owned by Coles Group&amp;nbsp;â reached a deal). The retailer has agreed to distribute a variety of [[Inspiron]] and [[Studio]] notebooks, with minimal Studio desktops from the Dell range. {{As of|2009}}, Dell continues to run and operate its various kiosks in 18 shopping centres throughout Australia. On March 31, 2010 Dell announced to Australian Kiosk employees that they were shutting down the Australian/New Zealand Dell kiosk program.

In Germany, Dell is selling selected smartphones and notebooks via [[Media Markt]] and Saturn, as well as some shopping websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netzwelt.de/news/87864-discounter-check-dell-venue-pro-media-markt.html |title=Dell Venue Pro offered by Media Markt |publisher=Netzwelt.de |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competition===
Dell's major competitors include [[Hewlett-Packard Company|Hewlett-Packard]] (HP), [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Toshiba]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Sony]], [[Asus]], [[Lenovo Group|Lenovo]], [[IBM]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Sun Microsystems]]. Dell and its subsidiary, [[Alienware]], compete in the enthusiast market against [[AVADirect]], [[Falcon Northwest]], [[VoodooPC]] (a subsidiary of HP), and other manufacturers. In the second quarter of 2006, Dell had between 18% and 19% share of the worldwide personal computer market, compared to HP with roughly 15%.

{{As of|2006|alt=In late 2006}}, Dell lost its lead in the PC-business to Hewlett-Packard. Both [[Gartner]] and [[International Data Corporation|IDC]] estimated that in the third quarter of 2006, HP shipped [http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/19/Dell-computer-earnings-markets-equity-cx_mk_1019markets07.html?partner=yahootix more units]{{dead link|date=January 2011}} worldwide than Dell did. Dell's 3.6% growth paled in comparison to HP's 15% growth during the same period. The problem got worse in the fourth quarter, when Gartner [http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070117006106&amp;newsLang=en estimated] that Dell PC shipments declined 8.9% (versus HP's 23.9% growth). As a result, at the end of 2006 Dell's overall PC market-share stood at 13.9% (versus HP's 17.4%).

IDC reported that Dell lost more server market share than any of the top four competitors in that arena. IDC's Q4 2006 estimates show Dell's share of the server market at 8.1%, down from 9.5% in the previous year. This represents a 8.8% loss year-over-year, primarily to competitors [[EMC Corporation|EMC]] and [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yahoo.reuters.com/news/articlehybrid.aspx?storyID=urn:newsml:reuters.com:20070312:MTFH05034_2007-03-12_21-17-33_N12385967&amp;type=comktNews&amp;rpc=44|agency=Reuters  |title=World News, Business News, Breaking US &amp; International News|Reuters.com}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[The Brand Trust Report]], India study revealed that Dell is ranked as the 27th most trusted brand as compared to Samsung which stood at 5th and HP which ranked 23&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/business/slide-show/slide-show-1-indias-50-most-trusted-brands/20110120.htm |title=India's 50 most trusted brands |publisher=rediff.com |date=2011-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership with EMC===
The Dell/EMC brand applies solely to products that result from Dell's partnership with [[EMC Corporation]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In some cases Dell and EMC jointly design such products; other cases involve EMC products for which Dell will provide support&amp;nbsp;â generally midrange storage systems, such as [[fibre channel]] and [[iSCSI]] [[storage area network]]s. The relationship also promotes and sells OEM versions of backup, recovery, replication and archiving software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Dell.com/emc |title=Dell/EMC products |publisher=Dell.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2008, Dell and EMC announced the multi-year extension, through 2013, of their strategic partnership that began in 2001. In addition, Dell plans to expand its product line-up by adding the EMC [[Celerra]] NX4 storage system to the portfolio of Dell/EMC family of networked storage systems, as well as partnering on a new line of [[data deduplication|de-duplication]] products as part of its TierDisk family of [[data storage device|data-storage devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2008/2008_12_09_rr_000?c=us&amp;l=en |title=Dell, EMC Extend and Expand Strategic Alliance |publisher=Dell |date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2011, Dell announced officially discontinued reselling all EMC storage products, this put end to 10 years of Partnership. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dell, EMC End Storage Reseller Partnership Two Years Early|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Data-Storage/Dell-EMC-End-Storage-Reseller-Partnership-Two-Years-Early-705362/|accessdate=31 October 2011|newspaper=EWeeks|date=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental record==
Dell committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its global activities by 40% by 2015, with 2008 fiscal year as the baseline year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/corp-comm/cr-earth-emissions.aspx |title=Walking the Walk on Greenhouse Gas Reduction |publisher=Dell|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is listed in [[Greenpeace]]âs Guide to Greener Electronics that scores leading electronics manufacturers according to their policies on sustainability, climate and energy and how green their products are. In November 2011, Dell ranked 2nd out of 15 listed electronics makers (increasing its score to 5.1 from 4.9, which it gained in the previous ranking from October 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics|Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Dell was the first company to publicly state a timeline for the elimination of toxic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs), which it planned to phase out by the end of 2009. It revised this commitment and now aims to remove these toxics by the end of 2011 but only in its computing products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/toxics/2010/version16/Ranking%20tables%20Oct%202010-Dell.pdf|title=Ranking tables â October 2010|publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2010, Greenpeace activists protested at Dell offices in Bangalore, Amsterdam and Copenhagen calling for Dellâs founder and CEO Michael Dell to âdrop the toxicsâ and claiming that Dellâs aspiration to be âthe greenest technology company on the planetâ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_06_05_lon_000?c=us&amp;l=en |title=Dell Sets Goal Of Becoming Greenest Technology Company|Dell |publisher=Dell|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was âhypocriticalâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/dell-breaking-promise-290310/ |title=Dell targeted for breaking promise on toxic chemicals|Greenpeace International |publisher=Greenpeace International|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dell has launched its first products completely free of PVC and BFRs with the G-Series monitors (G2210 and G2410) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.dell.com/us/en/corp/d/corp-comm/earth-greener-products-materials.aspx |title=Materials Use: Whatâs Inside Our Products â And Whatâs Not|Dell |publisher=Dell|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green initiatives===
Dell became the first company in the [[information technology industry]] to establish a product-[[recycling]] goal (in 2004) and completed the implementation of its global consumer recycling-program in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialfunds.com/news/article.cgi/1421.html|title=Dell First US Computer Company to Commit to a Global Recycling Goal|author=William Baue|publisher=SocialFunds}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 6, 2007, the National Recycling Coalition awarded Dell its &quot;Recycling Works&quot; award for efforts to promote producer responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Recycling Coalition&quot;&gt;[http://www.nrc-recycle.org/recyclingworkswinners.aspx â National Recycling Coalition]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 19, 2007, Dell announced that it had exceeded targets in working to achieve a multi-year goal of recovering 275 million pounds of computer equipment by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070719/tx_Dell_recycling.html?.v=1 ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company reported the recovery of 78 million pounds (nearly 40,000 tons) of IT equipment from customers in 2006, a 93-percent increase over 2005; and 12.4% of the equipment Dell sold seven years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dell Inc.&quot;&gt;http://www.Dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2007/2007_07_19_rr_001?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp Dell Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2007 Dell set a goal of becoming the greenest technology company on Earth for the long term. The company launched a [[zero-carbon]] initiative that includes:
# reducing Dell's [[carbon intensity]] by 15 percent by 2012
# requiring primary suppliers to report carbon emissions data during quarterly business reviews
# partnering with customers to build the &quot;greenest PC on the planet&quot;
# expanding the company's carbon-offsetting program, &quot;Plant a Tree for Me&quot;.

The company introduced the term &quot;[[The Re-Generation]]&quot; during a [[round table]] in London commemorating 2007 [[World Environment Day]]. &quot;The Re-Generation&quot; refers to people of all ages throughout the world who want to &quot;make a difference&quot; in improving the world's environment. Dell also talked about plans to take the lead in setting an environmental standard for the &quot;[[technology industry]]&quot; and maintaining that [[leadership]] in the future.

Dell reports its environmental performance in an annual [[Corporate Social Responsibility]] (CSR) Report that follows the [[Global Reporting Initiative]] (GRI) protocol. Dell's 2008 CSR report ranked as &quot;Application Level B&quot; as &quot;checked by GRI&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Dell 2008 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, Section &quot;GRI Performance Indicators Index&quot; http://i.Dell.com/sites/content/corporate/environment/en/Documents/Dell%20Corporate%20Responsibility%20Report%202008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The company aims to reduce its external environmental impact through energy-efficient evolution of products, and also reduce its direct operational impact through energy-efficiency programmes. Internal energy-efficiency programmes reportedly save the company more than $3&amp;nbsp;million annually in energy-cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biodiversityscience.org/xp/CELB/news-events/press_releases/080608.xml&lt;/ref&gt; The largest component of the company's internal energy-efficiency savings comes through [[PC power management]]: the company expects to save $1.8&amp;nbsp;million in energy costs through using specialised energy-management software on a network of 50,000 PCs.&lt;ref&gt;How Dell Does IT: Energy Efficiency, Dell Cuts energy costs by up to 40% with a new power management plan http://www.Dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/casestudies/en/emea/eu/fy2008_q3_id688?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dell on Dell: Energy Efficiency Case Study http://www.1e.com/download/whitepapers/688_2007_DellonDellenergy_79991399.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Lawsuits involving Dell Inc.}}
      
In the 1990s, Dell switched from using primarily [[ATX]] [[motherboard]]s and [[Computer power supply|PSU]] to using boards and power-supplies with mechanically identical but differently wired connectors. This meant                 customers wishing to upgrade their hardware would have to replace parts with scarce Dell-compatible parts instead of commonly available parts. However, company practice in this respect changed in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=339053 |title=Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design &gt; Dell proprietary (non-standard) ATX design |publisher=InformIT |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Scott. ''Upgrading and Repairing PCs'', 13ed, Indianapolis: Que Publications, 2002, ISBN 0-7897-2542-8, and subsequent editions&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, complaints about Dell more than doubled to 1,533, after earnings grew 52% that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = It's Dell vs. the Dell Way|url = http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/feb2006/tc20060223_710372.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Dell acknowledged that it had problems with customer service. Issues included call-transfers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060612_046085.htm Dell Spiffs Up Its Service], ''Business Week''&lt;/ref&gt;
of more than 45% of calls and long wait-times. [http://www.direct2Dell.com/ Dell's blog] detailed the response: &quot;We're spending more than a $100&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;â and a lot of blood, sweat and tears of talented people&amp;nbsp;â to fix this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct2Dell.com/one2one/archive/2006/07/13/433.aspx No Magic Wands For Customer Service], The Official Dell blog&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, the company increased its spending on customer service to $150&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/09/18/8386121/index.htm|publisher=CNN|date=September 18, 2006|accessdate=May 1, 2010|title=Dell in the penalty box|first1=David|last1=Kirkpatrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite significant investment in this space, Dell continues to face public scrutiny with even the company's own website littered with complaints regarding the issue escalation process.&lt;ref&gt; [http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/p/19313901/19624973.aspx], Dell Community Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2007, Dell Inc. announced that after an internal investigation into its accounting practices it would restate and reduce earnings from 2003 through to the first quarter of 2007 by a total amount of between $50&amp;nbsp;million and $150&amp;nbsp;million, or 2 cents to 7 cents per share.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news|first=Joshua|last=Lipton|title=Dell's Investigation Comes To a Close|url = http://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/08/17/Dell-computer-investigation-markets-equity-cx_jl_0817markets19.html |work=Forbes|date=August 17, 2007|accessdate=August 19, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation, begun in November 2006, resulted from concerns raised by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] over some documents and information that Dell Inc. had submitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Damon|last=Darlin|title=Dell Accounting Inquiry Made Formal by S.E.C.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/16/technology/16Dell.html?ex=1321333200&amp;en=d4ea7f8f975e4474&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |work=New York Times |date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=August 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that Dell had not disclosed large exclusivity payments received from [[Intel]] for agreeing not to buy processors from a rival manufacturer. In 2010 Dell finally paid $100&amp;nbsp;million to settle the SEC's charges of fraud. Michael Dell and other executives also paid penalties and suffered other sanctions, without admitting or denying the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Reed |title=Dell pays $100m penalty to settle accounting fraud charges |url=http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2266948/dell-pays-100m-penalty-settle |work=Accountancy Age |date=July 23, 2010 |accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Dell apologized after the firm offered its Latitude E4300 notebook at NT$18,558 (US$580), 70% lower than usual price of NT$60,900 (US$1900) in its Taiwan website. The firm withdrew orders and offered a voucher of up to NT$20,000 (US$625) a customer in compensation. The consumer rights authorities in Taiwan fined Dell NT$1&amp;nbsp;million (US$31250) for customer rights infringements. Many consumers sued the firm for the unfair compensation. A court in southern Taiwan ordered the firm to deliver 18 laptops and 76 flat-panel monitors to 31 consumers for NT$490,000 (US$15,120), less than a third of the normal price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2010/06/07/2003474881 Dell loses Taiwan consumer lawsuit: report]&lt;/ref&gt; The court said the event could hardly be regarded as mistakes, as the prestigious firm said the company mispriced its products twice in Taiwanese website within 3 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jirs.judicial.gov.tw/FJUD/PrintFJUD03_0.aspx?jrecno=98%2c%e8%a8%b4%2c1009%2c20100531%2c2&amp;v_court=TND+%e8%87%ba%e7%81%a3%e8%87%ba%e5%8d%97%e5%9c%b0%e6%96%b9%e6%b3%95%e9%99%a2&amp;v_sys=V&amp;jyear=98&amp;jcase=%e8%a8%b4&amp;jno=1009&amp;jdate=990531&amp;jcheck=2 full-text verdict]&lt;/ref&gt;
