'''Arch Linux''' (or ''Arch'', pronounced {{IPA-en|ËÉrtÊ|}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osdir.com/ml/linux.arch.general/2005-08/msg00254.html |title=[arch&amp;#93; Pronunciation of our beloved distribution's name |publisher=Osdir.com |date=2005-08-24 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an independently developed, [[Linux distribution|Linux-based]] [[operating system]] for [[i686]] and [[x86-64]] computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archlinux.org/about/ |title=Arch Linux - About |publisher=www.archlinux.org |accessdate=2011-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed predominantly of [[free and open source software]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/distros/common-distros.html#Arch |title=GNU Project - Explaining Why We Don't Endorse Other Systems |publisher=www.gnu.org |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and supports community involvement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=arch |title=DistroWatch.com: Arch Linux |publisher=www.distrowatch.com |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The design approach of the development team focuses on simplicity, elegance, code correctness and [[minimalism (computing)|minimalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/The_Arch_Way |title=The Arch Way |publisher=Wiki.archlinux.org |date=2009-10-09 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Simplicity&quot;, according to Arch, is defined as &quot;...without unnecessary additions, modifications, or complications..&quot; and is defined from a developer standpoint, rather than a user standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phraktured.net/arch-way.html |title=Archway |publisher=phraktured.net |date=2007-11-09 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by [[CRUX]], another minimalist distribution, Judd Vinet started Arch Linux in March 2002. Vinet led the project until 1 October 2007, when he stepped down due to lack of time, transferring control of the project to Aaron Griffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=38024 |title=Arch Linux Forums / Arch Leadership |publisher=Bbs.archlinux.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the installation images released by the Arch team are simply up to date snapshots of the main system components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/378030/|title=Rolling with Arch Linux [LWN.net]|publisher=lwn.net |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

To facilitate regular package changes, [[Pacman (package manager)|pacman]] was developed by Judd Vinet to provide Arch with its own package manager able to track dependencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/10047|title=Arch Linux: Why It Rocks - OSnews|publisher=www.osnews.com|date=2005-03-21|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users can create packages compatible with pacman using the [[#Arch Build System|Arch Build System]] and custom PKGBUILD scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.linode.com/using-linux/package-management#sph_using-the-arch-build-system-abs|title=Linode Library :: Using the Arch Build System|publisher=library.linode.com|date=2011-09-08|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This functionality has helped support the [[#Arch User Repository|Arch User Repository]], which consists of user contributed packages to supplement the official repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxdistroreview.com/arch-linux|title=Arch Linux - Linux Distro Review|publisher=www.linuxdistroreview.com|date=2011-03-08|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Design and principles ==

Arch is largely based around binary packages. Packages are targeted for [[i686]] and [[x86-64]] [[microprocessors]] to assist performance on modern [[hardware]]. A [[ports collection|ports]]/[[ebuild]]-like system is also provided for automated source compilation, known as the Arch Build System.

The Arch focus on simplicity and economy for developers means, among other things, that the main effort in assisting the user is not expended in crafting GUI configuration tools&amp;nbsp;â the package manager, for example, does not have an official graphical front-end&amp;nbsp;â but making well-annotated configuration files and extensive use of shell scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/5971 |title=OSNews.com |publisher=OSNews.com |date=2004-02-10 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has earned it a reputation as a distribution for &quot;intermediate and advanced Linux users who aren't afraid of the command line&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.polishlinux.org/archlinux |title=PolishLinux.org Wiki: Archlinux |publisher=Wiki.polishlinux.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Relying on complex tools to manage and build your system is going to hurt the end users. [...] &quot;If you try to hide the complexity of the system, you'll end up with a more complex system&quot;. Layers of abstraction that serve to hide internals are never a good thing. Instead, the internals should be designed in a way such that they NEED no hiding.|Aaron Griffin&lt;ref&gt;http://phraktured.net/arch-way.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== init framework ===

Arch uses a [[BSD]]-style [[init]] framework, a tradeoff of flexibility for simplicity. It also includes and permits use of [[UNIX System V|System V]] [[runlevels]] and the inittab file, but there is little differentiation between runlevels. This is because the modules and daemons loaded at startup are arranged as arrays in the central configuration file, /etc/rc.conf, as opposed to System V's system of a directory for each runlevel containing a numbered symbolic link for each daemon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Rc.conf |title=Rc.conf&amp;nbsp;â ArchWiki |publisher=Wiki.archlinux.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the ability to start processes asynchronously, which neither the original BSD init nor the original Sys V init have.
''See [[init]] for more detail on the differences between the two systems.''

== Installation ==

The Arch Linux website supplies [[ISO image]]s that can be run from [[Live CD|CD]] or [[Live USB|USB]]. The Arch Linux installer is a shell script using [[dialog (software)|dialog]] for user interaction. The default install is minimalistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners'_Guide#DON.27T_PANIC.21 |title=ArchWiki :: Beginners Guide&amp;nbsp;â ArchWiki |publisher=Wiki.archlinux.org |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further system customization and expansion (adding a window manager, desktop environment, etc.) must be done manually, installing packages downloaded from online repositories. Arch is therefore generally considered relatively involved to install, in comparison to other operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celettu.wordpress.com/2008/06/25/arch-linux-200806-overlord/ |title=Wordpress :: Arch 2008.06 Review |publisher=Celettu.wordpress.com |date=2008-06-25 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to using CD or USB images for installation is to use the static version of the package manager Pacman, from within another GNU/Linux based operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Install_From_Existing_Linux |title=ArchWiki :: Install From Existing Linux&amp;nbsp;â ArchWiki |publisher=Wiki.archlinux.org |date=2009-11-21 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user can [[mount (Unix)|mount]] his or her newly formatted [[Disk partitioning|drive partition]], and use Pacman with the appropriate [[Command-line argument|command-line switch]] to have it use the mountpoint of the device as [[Root directory|root]] for its operations. This way the base package group and any additional packages can be installed on the newly formatted partition by having Pacman retrieve them from its [[Mirror (computing)|mirrors]]. However, there are further actions that need to be taken before the system is ready for use after this process, most notably installing a [[Booting|bootloader]], and making various configurations to the new system.

== Package management ==

=== Pacman ===
{{Main|Pacman (package manager)}}
All packages are managed using the [[Pacman (package manager)|Pacman]] [[package management|package manager]]. Pacman handles package installation, upgrades, removal and downgrades, and features automatic dependency resolution. The packages for Arch Linux are obtained from the Arch Linux package tree and are compiled for either i686 or x86-64 architectures. Arch Linux is primarily based on binary packages in the tar.gz and tar.xz format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archlinux.org/news/490/ |title=Switching to xz compression for new packages |author=Pierre Schmitz |date=2010-03-23 |work=Archlinux.org |publisher= |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repositories ===

Currently, the following basic official repositories exist:

* ''core'', which contains all the packages needed to set up a base system
* ''extra'', which holds packages not required for the base system, including desktop environments and programs
* ''community'', which contains packages built and voted on by the community; includes packages that have sufficient votes and have been adopted by a &quot;trusted user&quot;.
* ''multilib'', a centralized repository for x86_64 users to more readily support 32-bit applications in a 64-bit environment.

In addition, there also exist ''testing'' repositories that include package candidates for other repositories.  Currently, the following testing repositories exist:
* ''testing'', with packages for ''core'' and ''extra''.
* ''community-testing'', with packages for ''community''.
* ''multilib-testing'', with packages for ''multilib''.

The ''staging'' and ''community-staging'' repositories are used for some rebuilds to avoid broken packages in ''testing''. 

The ''unstable'' repository was dropped in July 2008 and most of the packages moved to other repositories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archlinux.org/static/magazine/2008/newsletter-2008-Aug-04.html|title=Arch Linux Newsletter 08-04-2008|publisher=Archlinux.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the official repositories, there are a number of unofficial user repositories, the most well-known being the [[#Arch User Repository|Arch User Repository]], or AUR, hosted on the Arch Linux site.

===Repository security===
Until version 4.0.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pacman NEWS file as of 4.0.0|url=http://projects.archlinux.org/pacman.git/tree/NEWS?id=d3d3b861ac2c4ce63c306e00395945bfa3c1b6c6|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arch Linux's package manager lacked support for signed packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FS#5331 - Signed packages|url=https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/5331|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packages and metadata were not verified for authenticity by [[Pacman (package manager)|pacman]] during the download-install process. Without package authentication checking, tampered-with or malicious repository mirrors can comprimise the integrity of a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.arizona.edu/stork/packagemanagersecurity/attacks-on-package-managers.html|title=Attacks on Package Managers |publisher=cs.arizona.edu|date=2008-07-10|accessdate=2010-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2011|11|06}}, however, 51% of packages in the repositories are signed.&lt;ref&gt; https://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2011-November/022067.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Arch Build System ===

The Arch Build System is a [[ports collection|ports]]-like source packaging system that compiles source tarballs into binary packages, which are installed via [[Pacman (package manager)|Pacman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System |title=ArchWiki :: Arch Build System&amp;nbsp;â ArchWiki |publisher=Wiki.archlinux.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arch Build System provides a directory tree of [[shell script]]s, called PKGBUILDs, that enable any and all official Arch packages to be customized and compiled. Rebuilding the entire system using modified [[CFLAGS|compiler flags]] is also supported by the Arch Build System. The Arch Build System '''makepkg''' tool can be used to create custom .pkg.tar.xz packages from third-party sources. The resulting packages are also installable and trackable via [[Pacman (package manager)|Pacman]].

=== Arch User Repository ===

In addition to the repositories, the Arch User Repository provides user-made PKGBUILD scripts for packages not included in the repositories. The PKGBUILD scripts simplify building from source by explicitly listing and checking for dependencies and configuring the install to match the Arch architecture. The scripts are available for download from http://aur.archlinux.org. Arch User Repository helper programs can further streamline the downloading and building process. However, such tools that search, download and run PKGBUILD scripts automatically will never be included in the official repositories because of potential security risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardware.no/artikler/aaron_griffin_english/49507/3 |title=INTERVJU: Arch Linux: Popular KISS distro&amp;nbsp;â Interview&amp;nbsp;â Part II |publisher=Hardware.no |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|date=September 2009}}

The Arch User Repository provides the community with packages that are not included in the repositories. Reasons include:

* License issues. Software that cannot be redistributed, but is free to use, can be included in the Arch User Repository since all that is hosted by the Arch Linux web site is a shell script that downloads the actual software from elsewhere. Examples include proprietary [[freeware]] such as [[Google Earth]] and [[RealPlayer]].
* Modified official packages. The Arch User Repository also contains many variations on the official packaging as well as beta versions of software that is contained within the repositories as stable releases.
* Rarity of the software. Some new or rarely used programs have not been added to the official repositories (yet).

PKGBUILDs for any software can be contributed by ordinary users and any PKGBUILD that is not confined to the Arch User Repository for policy reasons can be voted into the community repositories.

== Versions ==

=== &quot;Rolling releases&quot; ===

Similar to [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], and unlike other major distributions such as [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], Arch Linux does not schedule releases for specific dates but uses a &quot;[[rolling release]]&quot; system, with new packages provided daily. Its package management allows users to keep systems up-to-date easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvd-guides.com/content/view/212/104/ |title=Arch Linux Review |publisher=DVD-Guides.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than encouraging users to move between discrete releases, Arch Linux releases are simply snapshots of the current set of packages, sometimes with revised installation software. Therefore it makes no difference from which release Arch gets installed if updates are installed afterwards. In fact, some members of the Arch forums take pride in showing the age of the installation.

From version 2009.02 the goal is to bring coordinated releases following the rhythm of kernel releases, in order to provide optimal hardware support, this means a new release every 3 or 4 months.

{{As of|2011|08}}, the latest image is 2011.08.19, dated 19 August 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011.08.19 installation media&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archlinux.org/news/20110819-installation-media/ |title=2011.08.19 installation media |publisher=Arch Linux |date=2011-08-19 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
