'''California State University, Chico''' is the second-oldest campus in the twenty-three-campus [[California State University]] system.  It is located in [[Chico, California|Chico]], [[California]], about ninety miles north of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. California State University, Chico is commonly known as '''Chico State''' or '''Cal State, Chico'''.

== History ==

On March 12, 1887, a legislative act was enacted to create the Northern Branch State Normal School of California. Less than a month later, Chico was chosen as the location. On June 24, 1887, General [[John Bidwell]] donated {{convert|8|acre|ha}} of land from his cherry [[orchard]]. Then on July 4, 1888, the first cornerstone was laid. On September 3, 1889, doors opened for the 90 enrolled students. The library opened on January 11, 1890 with 350 books. On June 20, 1891 the first graduation took place, a class of 15.

In 1910, Annie Bidwell donated an additional {{convert/spell|2|acre|ha}} of land to be used for work with elementary agriculture. The next year Mrs. Bidwell donated an orange orchard lot 55 Ã {{convert|440|ft|m}} as the children's playground, which is connected to the Training School.&lt;ref name=csuchico&gt;{{cite web | last = Bailey | first = Mary Ellen | title=University Archives: Chico State Normal School (1887-1921)|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lspr/time1.html| accessdate=2008-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty years later in 1921, legislation was enacted to change the school's name to Chico State Teacher's College. In 1922, Chico State Teacher's College added a junior college curriculum and awarded a certificate after two years. Also in 1922, [[Bidwell Mansion State Historic Park|Bidwell Mansion]] was turned into a women's dormitory, Bidwell Hall. In 1923 the first college paper, ''The Collegian'', was published. In 1924, the state board of education allowed the school to grant [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degrees. Also in 1924, the [[Bobcat|wildcat]] was chosen as the [[mascot]]. In 1925 the [[alumni]] organization was founded. In 1927 a fire destroyed the Normal Building. That same year a gym was built on the grounds of Bidwell Mansion. In 1929, the cornerstone for the new administration building was laid on top of Normal Building's original cornerstone. In 1929 the student bookstore was established.

[[Image:Chico State campus in the spring.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Chico State campus in the spring]]
In 1935, Bidwell Hall was turned into a recreation and student center - the first student union. Also in 1935 a legislative act changed the college name from Chico State Teachers College to Chico State College. In 1937 evening classes started on campus and athletic fields were purchased from the Chico Board of Education. In 1939, chimes were installed in library tower. Sororities held a fund drive to raise $600 for them. In 1940 the college offered civilian pilot classes.

In 1948, dorms for 200 male students were set up on west side of Warner Street. The buildings were built during [[World War II]] and were used as bachelor quarters for a Marine Hospital in [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]]. They were brought to Chico State in sections and reconstructed in the spring of 1948. The two-story barrack-like structures had 36 rooms, each occupied by 4 students. North Hall later became a girls [[dormitory]]. The speech and debate team was founded by Herbert Rae, Speech &amp; Drama Department Chair.

In 1950, California's governor allowed state colleges to grant Master of Arts degrees. In 1951 the college reorganized from 18 departments into seven divisions with chairmen. Then in 1956 a new flagpost and sign in front of Kendall Hall was donated by the class of 1956. In the following year, 1957, a new [[cafeteria]] was built and the rose gardens were planted. In 1958 the first &quot;telecourse&quot; was taught, Psychology 51.

KCSC, a student-run radio station, launched, broadcasting old-time radio dramas on the campus public address system in 1951.

In 1972, Chico State College became California State University, Chico as a result of legislation passed in 1971.

In 1975, broadcasts of classes through [[closed circuit television|closed circuit TV]] were used for the first time by residents in [[Oroville, California|Oroville]], [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] and [[Colusa, California|Colusa]]. Also in 1975,'' [[The Orion (California State University, Chico)|The Orion]]'', the campus student newspaper, published its first issue. In 1977, the other campus paper, ''The Wildcat'', changed its name to ''[[News and Review|Chico News and Review]]'' and moved off campus to become an independent publication. In 1978 bike riding was restricted on campus.

Chico State's library was renamed for [[Ted Meriam]] in 1981. Notably, the 75th Pioneer Days was held in 1985, but the event was canceled in 1987, ostensibly because of a [[riot]].

In 1987, Chico State was ranked as the number one party school by ''[[Playboy]]'' &lt;ref name=&quot;SnopesPlay&quot;/&gt; and has subsequently been ranked as a party school by other publications.&lt;ref name=&quot;SnopesPlay&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.snopes.com/college/admin/playboy.asp | title=Playboy's Party Schools| publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |year= 2008 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;online university&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.onlineuniversities.com/rankings/10-biggest-party-schools/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chico State was not included on Playboy's most recent list of party schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.madison.com/archives/read.php?ref=/tct/2006/04/05/0604050459.php | title='books, Babes, Beer' | agency=Associated Press |date= April 5, 2006 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The California State University, Chico campus consists of a {{convert|119|acre|ha|adj=on}} main campus and a {{convert|1,040|acre|ha|adj=on}} university farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;csuc1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/catalog/cat09/01Front/Facts.html |title=CSU, Chico - 2009-2011 University Catalog |publisher=Csuchico.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early construction===
The construction of the normal school building was begun in September, 1887. It was a large brick building, consisting of three stories and full basement. It was of Romanesque design with Elizabethan gables and artificial stone trimmings. The building was destroyed by a fire in 1927. The current administration building Kendall Hall was built on the site of the normal school in 1929.&lt;ref name=&quot;csuchico.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lspr/campbuild.html |title=University Archives - Campus Buildings |publisher=Csuchico.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:AdministrationHallChico.jpg|225px|right|thumb|Chico State's Kendall (Administration) Hall]]

Colusa Hall, completed in 1921 is the oldest building on campus. It was used for purposes related to the industrial arts, but now it serves as an art gallery and public events facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;csuchico.edu&quot;/&gt;

===Residence halls===
Currently, there are seven on-campus residential halls. Sutter, Whitney, Shasta and Lassen halls are on the main campus, while Esken, Mechoopda and Konkow are near the athletic fields about a block and a half away from the main campus. Whitney, Shasta and Lassen are the names of major mountains in Northern California, and the others are named after Indian tribes which used to inhabit the area. Most buildings that make up the campus are named after counties in California.  University Village or &quot;UV&quot; is a university-owned dorm about a mile off campus. The university opened its newest dorm, Sutter Hall, for the Fall 2010 semester. It is located between Whitney and Shasta and Lassen halls. For much of the Fall 2010 semester, Sutter Hall's dining area remained closed.  However, it opened in the Spring 2011 semester, featuring new dining options for students.

===Recent construction===
The Wildcat Recreation Center (WREC), approved by a 2005 student ballot initiative, opened in August 2009. It has received a LEED rating of Gold for its sustainable and environmentally conscious features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.csuchico.edu/2010/08/09/wildcat-recreation-center-receives-gold-rating-for-green-building-standards/ |title=CSU, Chico News Â» Blog Archive Â» Wildcat Recreation Center Receives Gold Rating for Green Building Standards |publisher=News.csuchico.edu |date=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
