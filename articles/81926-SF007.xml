'''Blender''' is a [[free and open source software|free and open-source]] [[3D computer graphics software|3D computer graphics software product]] used for creating animated films, visual effects, interactive 3D applications or video games. The current release (stable) version is 2.60, and was released on October 19, 2011.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-260/ Blender 2.60]&lt;/ref&gt; Blender's features include [[3D modeling]], [[UV mapping|UV unwrapping]], [[Texture mapping|texturing]], [[Skeletal animation|rigging and skinning]], fluid and smoke simulation, [[Particle system|particle]] simulation, [[Computer animation|animating]], [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]], [[video editing software|video editing]] and [[compositing]].

==History==
[[File:Blender3D 2.4.5-screen.jpg|250px|thumb|Blender 2.4 screenshot]]

Blender was developed as an in-house application by the Dutch animation studio NeoGeo and Not a Number Technologies (NaN). It was primarily authored by [[Ton Roosendaal]], who had previously written a [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracer]] called Traces for [[Amiga]] in 1989. The name &quot;Blender&quot; was inspired by a song by [[Yello]], from the album ''[[Baby (Yello album)|Baby]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldsbestlogos.blogspot.com/2007/10/blender-logo.html |title=Brief history of the Blender logo |accessdate=2007-01-18 |last=Kassenaar |first=Joeri |date=2005-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosendaal founded NaN in June 1998 to further develop and distribute the program. The program was initially distributed as [[shareware]]&lt;!--did the c-key make it shareware?--&gt; until NaN went bankrupt in 2002.

The creditors agreed to release Blender under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]], for a one-time payment of â¬100,000 ([[United States Dollar|US$]]100,670 at the time). On July 18, 2002, a Blender funding campaign was started by Roosendaal in order to collect donations and on September 7, 2002 it was announced that enough funds had been collected and that the Blender [[source code]] would be released. Today, Blender is [[free software|free]], open-source software and is, apart from the two half-time employees and the two full-time employees of the Blender Institute, developed by the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.org/blenderorg/blender-foundation/history/|title=Blender.org history|location=Amsterdam|date=2008-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Blender Foundation initially reserved the right to use [[dual license|dual licensing]], so that, in addition to GNU GPL, Blender would have been available also under the &quot;Blender License&quot;, which did not require disclosing source code but required payments to the Blender Foundation. However, this option was never exercised and  was suspended indefinitely in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.org/BL/ |title=Blender License |accessdate=2007-01-19 |last=Roosendaal |first=Ton |date=2005-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Blender is solely available under GNU GPL.

===Suzanne===
[[File:Suzanne.svg|thumb|Suzanne]]
In January/February 2002 it was quite clear that NaN could not survive and would close the doors in March. Nevertheless, they found the energy for doing at least one more release: 2.25. As a sort-of [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]], a last personal tag, the artists and developers decided to add a [[3D model]] of a chimpanzee. It was created by Willem-Paul van Overbruggen (SLiD3), who also named it '''Suzanne''' after the orangutan in the [[Kevin Smith]] film ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]''.

Suzanne is Blender's alternative to more common [[List of common 3D test models|test models]] such as the [[Utah Teapot]] and the [[Stanford Bunny]]. A low-polygon model with only 500 faces, Suzanne is often used as a quick and easy way to test material, animation, rigs, texture, and lighting setups, and is also frequently used in joke images. The largest Blender contest gives out an award called the [[Suzanne Awards]].

==Features==
Blender has a relatively small installation size and runs on several popular computing platforms. Official versions of the software are released for [[Linux]], {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}, [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[FreeBSD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/ |title=Get Blender |publisher=blender.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is often distributed without extensive example scenes found in some other programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caligari.com/products/trueSpace/ts75/Brochure/specification.asp?Cate=BSpecification |title=trueSpace 7.6 specifications |publisher=Caligari Corporation |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the software contains features that are characteristic of high-end 3D software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.cgsociety.org/index.php/Comparison_of_3d_tools |title=Comparison of 3d tools - CGWiki |publisher=Wiki.cgsociety.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its capabilities are:
*Support for a variety of geometric primitives, including [[polygon mesh]]es, fast [[subdivision surface]] modeling, [[Bezier curve]]s, [[Nonuniform rational B-spline|NURBS surfaces]], [[metaballs]], [[digital sculpting]], outline [[font]], and a new n-gon modeling system called B-mesh.
*Internal render engine with ray tracing, indirect lighting, and ambient occlusion that can export in a wide variety of formats.
*Integration with a number of external render engines through plugins.
*Keyframed animation tools including [[Inverse kinematic animation|inverse kinematics]], armature (skeletal), hook, curve and lattice-based deformations, shape keys ([[morphing]]), non-linear animation, constraints, and vertex weighting.
* Simulation tools for Soft body dynamics including mesh collision detection, [[Lattice Boltzmann methods|LBM]] fluid dynamics, smoke simulation, and [[Bullet (software)|Bullet]] rigid body dynamics.
* A particle system which includes support for particle-based hair.
* Modifiers to apply non-destructive effects.
*[[Python (programming language)|Python]] scripting for tool creation and prototyping, game logic, importing and/or exporting from other formats, task automation and custom tools.
*Basic non-linear video/audio editing.
*[[Game Blender]], a sub-project, offers interactivity features such as collision detection, dynamics engine, and programmable logic. It also allows the creation of stand-alone, real-time applications ranging from architectural visualization to [[video game]] construction.
*A fully integrated node-based compositor within the rendering pipeline.
*Procedural and node-based textures, as well as texture painting, projective painting, vertex painting, and weight painting.
*Realtime control during physics simulation and rendering.

===User interface===
[[File:Blender Version 2.570.jpg|300px|thumb|Blender's user interface underwent a significant update during the 2.5x series]]
Blender has had a reputation as being difficult to learn for users accustomed to other 3D graphics software. Nearly every function has a direct keyboard shortcut and there can be several different shortcuts per key. Since Blender became [[free software]], there has been effort to add comprehensive [[contextual menu]]s as well as make the tool usage more logical and streamlined. There have also been efforts to visually enhance the [[user interface]], with the introduction of color themes, transparent floating widgets, a new and improved object tree overview, and other small improvements (such as a color picker widget).
Blender's user interface incorporates the following concepts:
;Editing modes: The two primary modes of work are ''Object Mode'' and ''Edit Mode'', which are toggled with the &lt;tt&gt;Tab&lt;/tt&gt; key. Object mode is used to manipulate individual objects as a unit, while Edit mode is used to manipulate the actual object data. For example, Object Mode can be used to move, scale, and rotate entire polygon meshes, and Edit Mode can be used to manipulate the individual vertices of a single mesh. There are also several other modes, such as Vertex Paint, Weight Paint, and Sculpt Mode. The 2.45 release also had the UV Mapping Mode, but it was merged with the Edit Mode in 2.46 Release Candidate 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blender.org/development/current-projects/changes-since-245/ Blender.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Hotkey]] utilization: Most of the commands are accessible via hotkeys. Until the 2.x and especially the 2.3x versions, this was in fact the only way to give commands, and this was largely responsible for creating Blender's reputation as a difficult-to-learn program. The new versions have more comprehensive [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] menus.
;Numeric input: Numeric buttons can be &quot;dragged&quot; to change their value directly without the need to aim at a particular widget, thus saving screen real estate and time. Both sliders and number buttons can be constrained to various step sizes with modifiers like the &lt;tt&gt;Ctrl&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Shift&lt;/tt&gt; keys. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] expressions can also be typed directly into number entry fields, allowing mathematical expressions to be used to specify values.
;Workspace management: The Blender GUI is made up of one or more screens, each of which can be divided into sections and subsections that can be of any type of Blender's views or window-types. Each window-type's own GUI elements can be controlled with the same tools that manipulate 3D view.  For example, one can zoom in and out of GUI-buttons in the same way one zooms in and out in the 3D viewport. The GUI viewport and screen layout is fully user-customizable. It is possible to set up the interface for specific tasks such as video editing or [[UV mapping]] or texturing by hiding features not utilized for the task. The user interface supports multiple monitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blenderguru.com/quick-tip-use-blender-on-multiple-monitors/ Using Blender with multiple monitors]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware requirements===
Blender has very low hardware requirements compared to other 3D suites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/3ds-max/system-requirements/ |title=System Requirements | publisher=Autodesk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/maya/system-requirements/ |title=System Requirements | publisher=Autodesk |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for advanced effects and high-poly editing, a more powerful system is needed.

===File format===
Blender features an internal file system that allows one to pack multiple scenes into a single file (called a &quot;'''.blend'''&quot; file).
*All of Blender's &quot;.blend&quot; files are forward, backward, and cross-platform compatible with other versions of Blender, with the exception of loading post-2.5 files in Blender pre-2.5.
*Snapshot &quot;.blend&quot; files can be auto-saved periodically by the program, making it easier to survive a program crash.
*All scenes, objects, materials, textures, sounds, images, post-production effects for an entire animation can be stored in a single &quot;.blend&quot; file. Data loaded from external sources, such as images and sounds, can also be stored externally and referenced through either an absolute or relative pathname. Likewise, &quot;.blend&quot; files themselves can also be used as libraries of Blender assets.
*Interface configurations are retained in the &quot;.blend&quot; files, such that what you save is what you get upon load. This file can be stored as &quot;user defaults&quot; so this screen configuration, as well as all the objects stored in it, is used every time you load Blender.

The actual &quot;.blend&quot; file is similar to the [[Electronic Arts|EA]] [[Interchange File Format]], starting with its own header (for example BLENDER_v248) that specifies the version, [[endianness]] and pointer size, followed by a collection of binary chunks storing the data blocks, and all the type and struct definitions also known as DNA. Although it is hard to read and convert a &quot;.blend&quot; file to another format using external tools, the [[readblend]] utility can do this. Dozens of import/export scripts that run inside Blender itself, accessing the object data via [[Application programming interface|API]], make it possible to inter-operate with other 3D tools.

Jeroen Bakker documented the Blender file format to allow inter-operation with other tooling. The document can be found at the ''The mystery of the blend'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmind.nl/blender/mystery_ot_blend.html Atmind.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; A DNA structure browser&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atmind.nl/blender/blender-sdna-249.html Atmind.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; is also available on this site.

Blender organizes data as various kinds of &quot;data blocks&quot;, such as Objects, Meshes, Lamps, Scenes, Materials, Images and so on. An object in Blender consists of multiple data blocks - for example, a polygon mesh has at least an Object and Mesh data block, and usually also a Material. This allows various data blocks to refer to each other; there may be, for example, multiple Objects that refer to the same Mesh, allowing the mesh to be duplicated while only keeping one copy of the mesh data in memory, and allowing subsequent editing of all duplicated meshes at the same time. Data block relationships can also be changed manually. Data blocks can also be referred to in other .blend files, allowing the use of .blend files as reusable object libraries.

==Comparison with other 3D software==
Blender is a dominant open source product&lt;ref name=CGSurvery2010&gt;[http://cgenie.com/articles/1158-cgenies-big-cg-survey-is-now-open-have-your-say.html The Big CG Survey 2010, Initial Results], CGenie, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with a range of features comparable to mid- to high-range commercial, [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref name=CGSurvery2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TDT3D&gt;BenoÃ®t Saint-Moulin. [http://www.tdt3d.be/articles_viewer.php?art_id=99 3D softwares comparisons table], TDT 3D, 7 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, CGenie classed Blender as a fledgling product with the majority of its users being &quot;hobbyists&quot; rather than students or professionals&lt;ref name=CGInd2010&gt;[http://cgenie.com/articles/1289-big-cg-survey-2010-industry-perspective.html The Big CG Survey 2010, Industry Perspective], CGenie, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but with its high standards rising year on year.&lt;ref name=CGSurvery2010 /&gt; They also reported that users thought Blender needed more development and required more compatibility with other programs.&lt;ref name=CGSurvery2010 /&gt;

A 2007 article&lt;ref name=TDT3D/&gt; claimed that Blender's interface was not up to industry standards, but was nevertheless suited to fast workflow and was sometimes more intuitive. Poor documentation was also criticized&lt;ref name=TDT3D /&gt; although there is community support through an online [[wiki]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.blender.org Blender documentation project]&lt;/ref&gt; and a range of books published both by the Blender Foundation and independently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;tbs=bks%3A1&amp;q=blender+3D&amp;btnG=Search Google Book Search for &quot;Blender 3D&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Blender 2.5 was released. Featuring a completely redesigned user interface, it aims to improve work flow and ease of use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-256-beta/ Blender's 2.56 release log - &quot;What to Expect&quot; and &quot;User Interface&quot; details]&lt;/ref&gt; During beta-testing, Blender 2.5's animation system was considered by the [[Sintel]] animators to be as good or better than some commercial packages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3dworldmag.com/2011/02/09/the-making-of-sintel/4/ 3DWorld magazine - Making of Sintel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Stucco-blendergame.jpg|250px|thumb|Game engine [[GLSL]] materials.]]

Since the opening of the source, Blender has experienced significant [[Code refactoring|refactoring]] of the initial codebase and major additions to its feature set.

Recent improvements include an animation system refresh;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BlenderDev/AnimationUpdate Wiki.blender.org]&lt;/ref&gt; a stack-based modifier system;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Blenderdev/Modifiers Wikiblender.org]&lt;/ref&gt; an updated particle system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-240/new-particle-options-and-guides/ Blender.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (which can also be used to simulate hair and fur); fluid dynamics; soft-body dynamics; GLSL shaders support&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-241/glsl-pixel-and-vertex-shaders/ Blender.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in the game engine; advanced UV unwrapping;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.blender.org/development/release-logs/blender-241/subsurf-uv-mapping/ Blender.org]&lt;/ref&gt; a fully recoded render pipeline, allowing separate render passes and &quot;render to texture&quot;; node-based material editing and compositing; Projection painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:Ref/Release_Notes/2.49/Projection_Paint |title=Dev:Ref/Release Notes/2.49/Projection Paint - BlenderWiki |publisher=wiki.blender.org |date=2009-06-03 |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of these developments were fostered by [[Google]]'s [[Google Summer of Code|Summer of Code]] program, in which the Blender Foundation has participated since 2005.

The current release (stable) version is 2.60, and was released on [[October 19]], 2011.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; New features include:
* New user interface
* New animation system, which allows almost any value to be animated
* Re-written, Python 3.x scripting API&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blender.org/documentation/250PythonDoc Blender.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Smoke simulation
* Updated toolset, with improved implementation
* Approximate indirect lighting
* Volume rendering
* Ray tracing optimizations, rendering some scenes &quot;up to 10x faster&quot;
* Solidify modifier
* Sculpt brush and stroke upgrade
* Add-on system

==Support==
In the month following the release of Blender v2.44, it was downloaded 800,000 times;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; this worldwide user base forms the core of the support mechanisms for the program.  Most users learn Blender through community tutorials and discussion forums on the internet such as Blender Artists&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blenderartists.org/forum/ Blenderartists.org]&lt;/ref&gt; ; however, another learning method is to download and inspect ready-made Blender models.

Numerous other sites, for example BlenderArt Magazine&lt;ref&gt;[http://blenderart.org/ Blenderart.org]&lt;/ref&gt;âa free, downloadable magazine with each issue handling a particular area in 3D developmentâand [http://www.blendernation.com/ BlenderNation], provide information on everything surrounding Blender, showcase new techniques and features, and provide tutorials and other guides.

Blender started out as an inhouse tool for a Dutch commercial animation company, NeoGeo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blender.org/blenderorg/blender-foundation/history/ blender.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Blender has been used for television commercials in several parts of the world including Australia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiorola.com/news/blender-in-tv-commercials/ Blender in TV Commercials]&lt;/ref&gt; Iceland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWSAdAO6ynU Midstraeti Showreel on the Blender Foundation's official YouTube channel]&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blendernation.com/new-fiat-campaign-in-brazil-using-blender-3d/ |title=New Fiat campaign in Brazil using Blender 3D |publisher=BlenderNation |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blendernation.com/brasilian-tv-commercial-made-with-blender/ |title=Brasilian TV Commercial made with Blender |publisher=BlenderNation |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blendernation.com/2010/08/25/russian-soda-commercial-by-art-dds/ Blendernation.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/21344454 Apoteksgruppen - ELW TV Commercial made with Blender]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large professional project that used  Blender was ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', where it was primarily used to create [[animatic]]s and pre-visualizations for the storyboard department.

:&quot;As an animatic artist working in the storyboard department of Spider-Man 2, I used Blender's 3D modeling and character animation tools to enhance the storyboards, re-creating sets and props, and putting into motion action and camera moves in 3D space to help make [[Sam Raimi|Sam Raimi's]] vision as clear to other departments as possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Testimonials, {{Wayback |url=http://www.blender.org/features-gallery/testimonials/ |date=20070221025521 |bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Anthony Zierhut,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthonyzierhut.com/ Anthonyzierhut.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Animatic Artist, Los Angeles.

The French-language film ''[[Friday or Another Day]]'' (''[[:fr:Vendredi ou un autre jour|Vendredi ou un autre jour]]'') was the first 35&amp;nbsp;mm feature film to use Blender for all the special effects, made on GNU/Linux workstations.&lt;ref&gt;

Blender has also been used for shows on the [[History (TV channel)|History Channel]], alongside many other professional 3D graphics programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blendernation.com/2006/09/27/blender-on-the-history-channel/ |title=Blender on the History Channel at BlenderNation |publisher=Blendernation.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tomm Moore]]âs ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'', which was partly produced in
Blender by the Belgian studio Digital Graphics, has been nominated for an Oscar in the category âBest Animated Feature Filmâ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blendernation.com/âthe-secret-of-kellsâ-nominated-for-an-oscar/ The Secret of Kellsâ nominated for an Oscar!]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elephants Dream (Open Movie Project: Orange)===
{{Main|Elephants Dream}}
In September 2005, some of the most notable Blender artists and developers began working on a short film using primarily [[free software]], in an initiative known as the Orange Movie Project hosted by the [[Netherlands Media Art Institute (NIMk)]]. The resulting film, ''Elephants Dream'', premiered on March 24, 2006.  In response to the success of ''Elephants Dream'', the Blender Foundation founded the Blender Institute to do additional projects with two announced projects: [[Big Buck Bunny]], also known as &quot;Project Peach&quot; (a 'furry and funny' short open animated film project) and [[Yo Frankie]], also known as Project Apricot (an open game in collaboration with [[CrystalSpace]] which reused some of the assets created during Project Peach).

===Big Buck Bunny (Open Movie Project: Peach)===
{{Main|Big Buck Bunny}}
On October 1, 2007, a new team started working on a second open project, &quot;Peach&quot;, for the production of the short movie ''Big Buck Bunny''. This time, however, the creative concept was totally different.
