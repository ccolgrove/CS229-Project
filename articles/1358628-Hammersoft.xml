'''NTD''' is an [[Australian]] [[television station]], licensed to and serving [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Palmerston, Northern Territory|Palmerston]] and surrounds. The station is owned by the [[Nine Entertainment Co.]], and is an [[owned-and-operated station]] of the [[Nine Network]], under the company name ''Territory Television Pty. Ltd.''.

==History==
===Origins===
NTD-8 was officially launched at 8:00pm on 11 November 1971, with the opening lineup beginning at 5:30pm with ''[[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]]'', followed by ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]'' at 6:00p.m. and at 7:00p.m., ''[[Burt Bacharach|An Evening with Burt Bacharach]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTD&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = NTD8 Darwin | work =  | publisher = Australian Television Archive | url = http://austv.hostforweb.com/cgi-bin/cgi2/index.rb?page=NTD8%20Darwin&amp;section=Television%20History%20Reference/TV%20Stations/Nine%20Network&amp;mode=0  | accessdate = 2008-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station was officially inaugurated at 8:00pm by Northern Territory Administrator, [[Fred Chaney]], followed by speeches from Sir Myles Wright, Fred Yates, John Hickman, and assistant executive John May.

The opening lineup continued with ''[[All the King's Men (1949 film)|All the King's Men]]'' at 8:30 p.m. and ''[[Danger Man]]'' at 10:30 p.m., followed by a station close.

The station was completely wiped out by [[Cyclone Tracy]] in December 1974 and was off air for 10 months while it was rebuilt from the ground up.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTD&quot;/&gt;

===1980s===
NTD-8 did not run any news and current affairs programming until October 18, 1982, after the station hired Rex Clark as a news director to launch a nightly bulletin at 7:00pm entitled ''News at Seven'', alongside a current affairs programme entitled ''Spectrum''.

In the late 1980s, NTD-8 was purchased by [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]], the owners of the [[Nine Network]] at that time. Following the acquisition of the station by Publishing and Broadcasting Limited, NTD-8 adopted a similar on-air presentation to the Nine Network with an ''Eight'' logo. NTD-8's news service revamped and rebranded along with the station, to become ''Eight National News''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTD&quot;/&gt;

===1990s===

NTD-8's first competitor was launched in 1998, owned by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting|Telecasters Australia]] under the name ''[[TND-34|Seven Darwin]]'', now [[Southern Cross Television]]. The introduction of a second commercial television operator in the Darwin television market brought an end to NTD-8's solus commercial operations of the prior three decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTD&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The-gardens-nt.jpg||250px|thumb|The [[Nine Network]]'s Darwin headquarters in [[The Gardens, Northern Territory|The Gardens]], [[Northern Territory]].]]

Territory Television Pty. Ltd. attempted to gain [[Seven Network]] affiliation rights prior to Seven Darwin's launch, in a strategic move to dominate and force the incoming competitor to align with [[Network Ten]]. This would have seen NTD-8 broadcast both Nine Network and Seven Network programming, however after being rejected affiliation, the station gained Network Ten affiliation to supplement their parent company's Nine Network programming.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTD&quot;/&gt;

===2000s===
On [[January 1|New Year's Day]] 2003, '''Eight Darwin''' became '''Nine Darwin''', in line with the rest of [[Kerry Packer]]'s Nine Network [[owned-and-operated station]]s. Following the name change to Channel Nine Darwin, the station defunct [[Network Ten]] programming from their line-up, and in 2005, the Network Ten affiliation rights were officially relinquished, and were then taken by [[Southern Cross Television]]'s [[TND]] in [[2005]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NTD&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, in the midst of the tug-of-war for the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] television rights, [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited|PBL]] announced that [[National Rugby League]] games will take precedence on the station over [[Australian Football League|AFL]] games, a sign that Nine may have be about to give up the race for the rights to a proposed [[Seven Network|Seven]]-[[Network Ten|Ten]] consortium, which they did, but not without putting in a [[Australian Dollar|$]]780 million dollar bid for the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/League/Darwins-wind-of-change-blows-for-NRL/2005/03/31/1111862534893.html | title = Darwin's wind of change blows for NRL | accessdate = 2007-05-19 | date = 2005-04-01 | author = Roy Masters | publisher = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Nine Darwin (NTD) began broadcasting [[Nine HD]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}. In April 2008, [[DTD (TV station)|Darwin Digital Television (DTD)]], a joint venture between the [[Nine Network]] and [[Macquarie Southern Cross Media]], began broadcasting on the [[Digital terrestrial television|digital terrestrial]] platform as a full-time [[Ten Network]] affiliate.&lt;ref name=&quot;acma&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title = New digital commercial television service for Darwin  | url = http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_310217 | publisher = [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] | date = 2007-05-18 | accessdate = 2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, it was speculated that [[Imparja Television]] was planning to purchase the station from the Nine Network.&lt;ref name=&quot;abctakeover&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Imparja takeover of Nine may be a step closer |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/18/2368379.htm |date=2008-09-18 |publisher=ABC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal would have involved the sale of the station, as well as its facilities and license.&lt;ref name=&quot;abctakeover&quot;/&gt; Negotiations for the sale of the station fell through on September 29, when Imparja failed to secure federal government funding to help finance the takeover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Funding refused to Imparja for Nine's Darwin operation |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,24897,24415717-7582,00.html |date=2008-09-29 |publisher=The Australian | accessdate=2008-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
