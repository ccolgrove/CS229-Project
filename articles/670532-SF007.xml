The '''University of Cape Town''' ('''UCT''') is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Cape Town]] in the [[Western Cape]] province of South Africa. UCT was founded in 1829 as the [[South African College]], and is the oldest university in South Africa and the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|second oldest extant university in Africa]].

==History==
[[File:University of Cape Town 1930.jpg|thumb|left|250px|University of Cape Town's Groote Schuur campus in 1930]]
The roots of UCT lie in the establishment of the [[South African College]] in 1829 as a school for boys. In 1874 the [[South African College Schools]], teaching up to secondary level, were separated from the College, which prepared students for the examinations of the [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]]. In 1918 the South African College was elevated to full university status with the power to award degrees, and renamed the University of Cape Town.

UCT moved to the [[Groote Schuur]] Estate campus in 1928. During the [[apartheid]] era, roughly 1960-1990, many UCT students consistently opposed apartheid, and the university was a bastion of liberalism. However, the demographics of the university did not begin to change meaningfully until the 1980s and especially the 1990s. 1987 saw frequent clashes between protesting students and police, with reporting of police presence on the campus being censored by the government. On 24 April 1987 the police entered the campus and this marked the first time since 1972 that South Africa's police services had suppressed a demonstration at a white university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cape Times report&quot;&gt;Cape Times, staff reporter, front page, Saturday, 25 April 1987. &quot;Large parts of the University of Cape Town campus were at times uninhabitable yesterday afternoon and some lectures were disrupted as a result of actions by certain people which may not be reported in terms of state-of-emergency press censorship. South African Breweries suffered a R120 000 loss when a cab of one of their vehicles was burnt on the upper campus in the wake of a studentsâ protest march over the deaths of six railway workers and the dismissal of 16 000 others. The governmentâs Interdepartmental Press Liaison Centre, last night refused the Cape Times permission to publish the full facts concerning the dayâs events at UCT. They also refused the newspaper permission to publish three photographs taken during the afternoon, including one of the burnt out vehicle. A four hour confrontation between the people who may not be identified and about 150 â 200 students followed a lunch time meeting attended by about 700 students, called to protest at the deaths and firing of SA Railwayâs and Harbourâs Workers Union (SARHWU) on Wednesday.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UCT crest was designed in 1859 by [[Charles Davidson Bell]], Surveyor-General of the Cape Colony at the time. Bell was an accomplished artist who also designed medals and the triangular Cape stamp.

==Campus==
[[Image:UCT Upper Campus landscape view.jpg|left|thumb|A view of UCT]]
The main teaching campus, known as the Upper Campus, is located on the [[Cecil Rhodes|Rhodes]] Estate on the slopes of [[Devil's Peak (Cape Town)|Devil's Peak]]. This campus contains, in a relatively compact site, the faculties of [[Science]], [[Engineering]], [[Commerce]], and [[Humanities]] (except for the arts departments), as well as [[Smuts Hall]] and Fuller Hall [[Dormitory|residences]]. Upper Campus is centered on Jameson Hall, the location for graduation and other ceremonial events, as well as many examinations. The original buildings and layout of Upper Campus were designed by [[JM Solomon]] and built between 1928 and 1930. Since that time, many more buildings have been added as the university has grown. Upper Campus is also home to the main library, The Chancellor Oppenheimer library which holds the majority of the University's 1.3 million volume collection.

Contiguous with Upper Campus, but separated from it by university sports fields and the [[M3 road (Cape Town)|M3 expressway]], are the Middle and Lower Campuses. These campuses, which are spread through the suburbs of [[Rondebosch, Cape Town|Rondebosch]], [[Rosebank, Cape Town|Rosebank]] and [[Mowbray, Cape Town|Mowbray]], contain the [[Law]] faculty, the [[South African College of Music]], most of the student residences, most of the university administrative offices, and various sporting facilities. The state of the art artificial grass [[soccer]] field has been approved by FIFA for training for [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uct.ac.za/dailynews/?id=7052&lt;/ref&gt; The Upper, Middle and Lower Campuses together are often referred to as the &quot;main campus&quot;.

The Faculty of [[Health Sciences]] is located on the [[Medical School]] campus next to the [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] in [[Observatory, Cape Town|Observatory]]. The [[Michaelis School of Fine Art|Fine Arts]] and [[Drama]] departments are located on the Hiddingh Campus in central [[Cape Town]]. The University's original building, now known as the ''Egyptian Building'', on the Hiddingh campus, was built in the [[Egyptian Revival]] style. The only other campus built in this style was the [[Medical College of Virginia]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in the United States. The [http://www.gsb.uct.ac.za UCT Graduate School of Business] is located on the [[Breakwater Lodge]] Campus at the [[Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront]].

==Organisation==
[[Image:UCT Jammie Plaza.jpg|thumb|Jameson Hall and Jammie Plaza, the focal point of the upper campus]]
The organisation of the University is defined in the Statute of the University of Cape Town, in accordance with the ''[[Higher Education Act, 1997]]''. Before 2002, it was defined by a [[private act|private Act of Parliament]].

The titular head of the University is the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]]; this is a ceremonial position without executive power. The primary role of the Chancellor is to confer degrees on behalf of the University, and to represent the University to the rest of the world. The current Chancellor is Ms [[GraÃ§a Machel]], elected for her first 10-year term in September 1999 and re-elected in May 2010.

The executive head of the University is the [[Vice-Chancellor]] (or VC). The VC has the overall responsibility for the policy and administration of the University. The current VC is Dr [[Max Price]], who replaced Professor [[Njabulo Ndebele]] on 1 July 2008. The VC is assisted in his task by a number of [[Deputy Vice-Chancellor]]s (DVCs) who handle specific portfolios. The [[Registrar (academic)|Registrar]] is responsible for the academic administration of the University, as well as legal matters, and is secretary to the University Council and Senate.

The academic departments of UCT are divided into six faculties: [[Commerce]], [[Engineering]] and the [[Built Environment]], [[Health Sciences]], [[Humanities]], [[Law]], and [[Science]]; each faculty is led by a Dean. The multidisciplinary Center for Higher Education Development rates on a level equal to the faculties. Although the Graduate School of Business is considered to be part of the Faculty of [[Commerce]], it is run independently and has its own Dean and Director.

==Students and staff==
[[Image:UCT Tugwell and Marquard.jpg|thumb|Tugwell and Marquard residence halls]]
{{As of|2009}}, 23,500 students were enrolled, of which 6,700 (28,5%) were [[postgraduate]] students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uct.ac.za/about/intro/statistics/ |title=Introducing UCT: Statistics |work=About the University |publisher=University of Cape Town |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio between male and female students is almost exactly 50:50. Over 50% of the student body is non-white. International students account for 19% of total student enrollment at 4300, representing over 100 countries. 

UCT employs approximately 4500 staff members of whom 44% are academic staff; the rest are administrative and support staff. In 2007 UCT had 866 permanent academic staff members. Between 85% and 90% of academic staff hold doctoral or masters qualifications.

==Student life==
UCT has 36 different sports clubs, including [[team sport]]s, [[individual sport]]s, [[extreme sport]]s and [[martial arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportsclubs.uct.ac.za/clubs.html |title=Current Sports Clubs at UCT |accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's sports teams, and in particular the [[rugby union]] team, are known as the &quot;[[Ikey Tigers]]&quot; or the &quot;Ikeys&quot;. The &quot;Ikey&quot; nickname originated in the 1910s as an [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] epithet applied to UCT students by the students of [[Stellenbosch University]], because of the supposed large number of Jewish students at UCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Swanson |first=Felicity |editor=Field, Sean, et al. |title=Imagining the City: Memories and Cultures in Cape Town |url=http://www.hsrcpress.ac.za/full_title_info.asp?id=2193 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-06-08 |year=2007 |publisher=HSRC Press |location=Cape Town |isbn=0-7969-2179-2 |page=210 |chapter=âDie SACS kom terugâ: intervarsity rugby, masculinity and white identity at the University of Cape Town, 1960s-1970s |chapterurl=http://www.hsrcpress.ac.za/download.asp?filename=013%20-%2011_Imagining_the_City~216200731940PM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stellenbosch is UCT's traditional rugby opponent; an annual &quot;Intervarsity&quot; match is played between  the two universities.
