The '''Wilson Sporting Goods Company''' is a sports equipment manufacturer based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and currently is a foreign [[subsidiary]] of the [[Finland|Finnish]] company [[Amer Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE7DF1038F932A15751C0A96F948260 Amer Group to Acquire Wilson Sporting Goods, ''New York Times'', 1989-02-21]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson makes equipment for many sports, among them [[badminton]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[softball]], [[American football|football]], [[golf]], [[racquetball]], [[Association football|soccer]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], [[tennis]], and [[volleyball]].

==History==
The company traces its roots to the Schwarzchild &amp; Sulzberger company (later changed to Sulzbeger &amp; Son's) based in New York City that operated [[meat packing]] plants in New York, [[Chicago]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=G4cDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA785&amp;dq=Sulzberger+and+Schwarzchild+KANSAS+CITY#v=onepage&amp;q=Sulzberger%20&amp;f=false Everybody's magazine, Volume 12 - The Greatest Trust in the World - January 1905]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sulzberger founded the '''Ashland Manufacturing Company''' in 1913 to use [[animal by-products]] from its slaughterhouses. It started out making tennis racket strings, violin strings, and surgical sutures but soon expanded into baseball shoes and tennis racquets.&lt;ref name=funding&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Wilson-Sporting-Goods-Company-Company-History.html International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 24. St. James Press, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, [[Thomas E. Wilson]], former president of meatpacker [[Morris &amp; Company]], was appointed President and renamed the company '''Thomas E. Wilson Company'''. The company acquired the Hetzinger Knitting Mills to produce athletic uniforms and a caddie bag company which produced golf balls but soon expanded into footballs and basketballs.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

In 1918, Wilson left to concentrate on the beef-packing business, changing the Sulzberger company to Wilson &amp; Co. (which would ultimately become [[Iowa Beef Packers]] and then be taken over by [[Tyson Foods]]).  The packing company continued to have control in the company until 1966 when it was sold to LTV.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

[[Image:Wilson P1010305.JPG|thumb|120px|left|A Wilson [[basketball]]]]
Under new president L. B. Icely it acquired the Chicago Sporting Goods Company and struck a deal to supply the [[Chicago Cubs]].  It also hired [[Arch Turner]], a leather designer who would design the leather football.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

In 1922, it introduced the [[Ray Schalk]] catcher's mitt which became the standard.  It worked with [[Knute Rockne]] to introduce the double-lined leather football and first valve football and the first waist-line football pants with pads.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

In 1925, it was renamed '''Wilson-Western Sporting Goods''' following a distribution agreement with Western Sporting Goods.

After Rockne's death, the company focused on golf, introducing the R-90, a sand wedge golf club inspired by [[Gene Sarazen]]'s victory in the 1932 [[British Open]].&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

In 1931, it renamed itself '''Wilson Sporting Goods Company'''. During World War II it introduced the Wilson Duke football, featuring the best leather, ends that were hand-sewn, lock-stitch seams, and triple lining, which was adopted as the official ball of the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

After the war it focused on tennis and signed [[Jack Kramer]] who developed its line of Jack Kramer signed tennis rackets.

Icley died in 1950 but the company continued to expand with many{{Who|date=July 2011}} believing that Icely's introduction of a [[computer]] to monitor inventory had been a huge help. In 1955, it acquired Ohio-Kentucky Manufacturing for making footballs.  In 1964 it acquired Wonder Products Company, which made toys and custom-molded items. It transformed the custom-mold section to make protective equipment in football and baseball, such as face masks for football helmets and leg guards for baseball catchers.

In 1967, it was acquired by Ling-Temco-Vought ([[LTV Corporation]]). In 1970 it was acquired by [[PepsiCo]].  It sold the official balls of the [[National Basketball Association]] and National Football League, and provided most of the uniforms of teams in [[Major League Baseball]], United States [[Summer Olympics]] teams.

In 1971, the grandson of Thomas Wilson rejoined the executive team for Wilson, operating as director of North American Operations.  Justin Wilson's corporate office is based in the Cincinnati area.  The family business reaffirmed its regional presence from 1994â2001, during which time Mick Wilson, the current beneficiary of the Wilson Franchise, made himself prominently known throughout the Ohio River Valley Region.  The Wilson family's active involvement continues to leave its legacy to this day.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 1979, Wilson tennis balls were first used in the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilson.com/wilson/racquet/products.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673975924&amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302756175&amp;bmUID=1182358231397 Wilson US Open ball]&lt;/ref&gt; and still are used to this day. In 2006, the [[Australian Open]] began using Wilson Tennis Balls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/sponsors.html Australian Open Sponsors, 2007-06-23]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, it was acquired by Westray Capital Corporation through subsidiary WSGC Holdings.  In 1989, WSGC merged with Bogey Acquisitions Company, which is affiliated with the Amer Group Ltd.&lt;ref name=funding/&gt;

The original [[kevlar]] [[Wilson ProStaff Original 6.0|Pro Staff]] model (Sampras' racquet) was heavy (350+gm) and small-headed (85 sq. in.); Roger Federer also used the same racquet model. Currently, he uses the BLX Six-One Tour model that is heavy (354 g/12.5 oz) and slightly larger (90 sq. in.). Jim Courier and Stefan Edberg also used the ProStaff Original, Edberg later switching to the ProStaff Classic in 1991, which was the same racquet (85 sq. in. with slightly rounded frame edges) but with different paint work. In late 2009, Wilson unveiled their latest line of racquets, codenamed 20x, which they would later rename BLX. This line directly replaces their previous K-Factor series with all new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennisnow.com/Blogs/Tennis-and-stuff-/October-2009/Wilson-BLX-(2010-line)--what-it-is-and-what-s-comi.aspx Wilson 2010 line - Tennis and stuff]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many pros use custom-made racquets that perform differently from the mass-produced versions.

Aside from tennis racquets, the Wilson sporting goods company also makes tennis shoes, strings, clothes, and racquet bags.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilson.com/en-us/tennis/ Tennis products by Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volleyball===
====Associations====
* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]] - Official ball

==In popular culture==
A Wilson volleyball &quot;co-starred&quot; alongside [[Tom Hanks]] in the film ''[[Cast Away]]'', and Tom's character named the ball &quot;Wilson&quot; in the film.  After the success of the film, Wilson Sporting Goods actually created and marketed volleyballs with Wilson's &quot;face&quot; printed on it.  Though no longer available as regular store merchandise, the balls have remained listed on the Wilson Sporting Goods website.

Hanks' character's loss of the famed volleyball is lampooned in a scene in the film [[Behind Enemy Lines (2001 film)|''Behind Enemy Lines'']] when the steam-catapult aboard an [[aircraft carrier]] launches a Wilson football off the flight deck prompting [[Owen Wilson]]'s character to cry &quot;Wilson!&quot;
