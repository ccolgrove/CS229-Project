'''Irina Krush''' (born  December 24, 1983) is an American [[chess]] player who won the [[U.S. Women's Chess Championship]] in 1998, 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;bird&quot;&gt;[http://main.uschess.org/content/view/7902/329/ &quot;Krush Wins Her Second Championship&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;chessbase2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=6530 &quot;Saint Louis: Irina Krush US Women's Champion 2010&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Odessa]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]] (now [[Ukraine]]), she is widely known for her series of chess training videos, the &quot;Krushing Attacks&quot; series.

Krush learned to play chess at age five, emigrating with her parents to [[Brooklyn]] that same year (1989). Krush attended [[Edward R. Murrow High School]] in Brooklyn, which is considered by many to be one of the top high school chess teams in the USA.

At age 14 Krush won the 1998 [[US Women's Chess Championship]] to become the youngest U.S. Women's Champion ever.  She holds the title of [[International Master]] (IM), a [[Woman Grandmaster]] (WGM), and has one of three tournament results (norms) necessary to qualify for the [[International Grandmaster]] (GM) title.  On the September 2011 [[FIDE]] rating list for women, Krush has a [[Elo rating system|FIDE rating]] of 2472, 27th best among active female players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ratings.fide.com/top.phtml?list=women  FIDE: Top 100 Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

Krush gained a measure of fame both inside and outside chess circles during the well-publicized &quot;[[Kasparov versus the World]]&quot; chess competition in 1999.  [[Garry Kasparov]] played the white pieces and the Internet public, via a [[Microsoft]] host website, voted on moves for the black pieces, guided by the recommendations of Krush and three of her contemporaries, [[Ãtienne Bacrot]], [[Elisabeth PÃ¤htz]] and [[Florin Felecan]].  On the tenth move, Krush suggested a [[Chess_terminology#N|novelty]], for which the World Team voted.  Kasparov said later that he lost control of the game at that point, and wasn't sure whether he was winning or losing. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Krush currently plays for the New York Knights in the [[U.S. Chess League]], and both she and her husband Canadian Grandmaster [[Pascal Charbonneau]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bird&quot;/&gt; have played in the United Kingdom league for Guildford-ADC. In 2006 they were students in Paris. She played on the U.S. Women's team in the [[38th Chess Olympiad]].
