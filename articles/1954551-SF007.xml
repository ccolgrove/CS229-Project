'''Mezzo''' is the [[desktop environment]] created by Ryan Quinn. Added to [[Symphony OS]], it follows [[Jason Spisak]]'s Laws of Interface Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=http://ftp.sun.ac.za/ftp/iso-images/mezzo/MezzoGreypaper.pdf |title=Mezzo White Paper |author=Jason Spisak |date=2005 |accessdate=2010-02-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poses a new way of presenting data to the user.  Mezzo uses [[FVWM]] as the window manager.

Mezzo disposes of standard concepts like &quot;The desktop is a folder&quot; and nested menu systems and instead presents all needed information directly to the user via the main desktop and four desk targets for tasks and files related to System, Programs, Files, and Trash. This tries to simplify the desktop.

Originally only available for [[Symphony OS]], some earlier versions of Mezzo were available as a [[.deb]] package for other [[Debian]]-based distributions such as [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. The design of Mezzo has also influenced other projects, particularly the ''Kuartet Desktop'', which is built upon KDE using [[SuperKaramba]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] for the rendering of a similarly designed GUI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=32541 |title=Kuartet Desktop |publisher=Kde-look.org |date=2005-12-15 |accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuartetdesktop.sourceforge.net |title=Kuartet Desktop Project |publisher=Kuartetdesktop |date=2006-02-23 |accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
