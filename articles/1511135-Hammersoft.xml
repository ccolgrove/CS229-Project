The team's white home jersey features its iconic blue sash, which crosses the chest diagonally from the right shoulder to the waist.

Since 1904 the city of Puebla has practiced football.First in 1904 with club [[Puebla A.C.]] founded by [[Englishmen]] who integrated into the Mexican football league during the amateur era. In 1944 and 1949 Puebla F.C. gained second, third and three fourth-place finishes in league play; in the 1944-45 season they won their first [[Copa MÃ©xico]], thereby paving the road for one of the great football clubs in Mexico. During the 1953-54 season they managed their second Copa MÃ©xico title. Puebla took home their first league title in the 1982-83 season after defeating [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] on penalty kicks. A third Copa MÃ©xico was accomplished after the 1987-88 season, and in the 1989-90 season they won both their fourth Copa MÃ©xico and their second league title after beating [[Club Universidad de Guadalajara|Universidad de Guadalajara]]. This feat (winning both the league and the Copa MÃ©xico championships) earned the team the right to be counted among the exclusive &quot;CampeÃ³nÃ­simo&quot; club. In 1991, they defeated [[Police FC (Trinidad and Tobago)|Police F.C.]] from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] for their first [[CONCACAF]] championship.

Due to the lack of opponents, having only one with neighboring town [[San MartÃ­n Texmelucan de Labastida|San MartÃ­n Texmelucan]], the club would be forced to go [[Orizaba]], [[Veracruz]] to find competition where they participated for a few years In the old '''Liga Veracruzana de Futbol'''. The club would have to wait until 1944 when football had been professionalized to once again make its return.

===Professional Debut===

In the 61st minute Manolo AlarcÃ³n scored a goal for America, and 3&amp;nbsp;minutes later Nicoluau scored another goal, and at the 69th minute Scarone scored yet another, reducing the deficit to a single goal. It seemed that America could achieve a historic comeback. But Puebla was a team with a lot of character and knew how to respond to America's 3 goals.

The 1992â1993&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puebla80s.blogspot.com/2009/06/equipo-puebla-1992-1995.html|title=Clubs stats and starting line up from 1992-1995|language=Spanish Blogspot by Carlos Morenastats |accessdate= |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wTMeb9hH |archivedate = 2011-02-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; championship marked the start of a difficult period in the club. The tournament started with problems with the Mexican Federation. The owner, Emilio Maurer Espinoza, was accused of irregularities in his administration and was stripped of the club and expelled from the league. That year Puebla finish 4th in group 2 with 43 points and didn't qualify.

In the 1993-1994&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt; championship. Puebla finished third in group one with 34 points.

In the 1994-1995 championship Puebla, after an irregular tournament, finishing in 3&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt; th in group 3 with 40 points and managed to qualify to a knockout series against Veracruz. Puebla defeated Veracruz 1-0, but they were eliminated in quarterfinals by [[Club AmÃ©rica|AmÃ©rica]] with an overall score of 4-2.

In the 1995-1996 championship Puebla changed owners and the brothers Abed came to power. The new owners had no respect for the clubs history or tradition changing the club colors. That year was one of clubs worst tournaments in Puebla's history and they finished in last place with 28 points by means of 6 victories, 10 draws, and 18 losses with 29 goals for and 54 against.

In 1997 Puebla welcomed the short tournament era in white an orange home kit, impulsed by the brothers Abed showing little interest in the clubs tradition. Nonetheless, that tournament was a success and qualified to the quarterfinals after getting 31 points in group 2. In quarterfinals Puebla eliminated [[Deportivo Toluca FÃºtbol Club|Toluca]] by a score of 2-1. In semifinals, however, Pueblas was eliminated by [[Necaxa]] with an aggregated score of 7-2.

Carlos also holds the record of most goals scored in one game in the history of the short tournaments, scoring 4 goals against [[Estudiantes Tecos|Tecos]] in 1996 and 4 goals against [[Monarcas Morelia|Morelia]] in 1998.

After three years as owners of the club the brothers Abed dismantled the club and sold it to Francisco Bernad Cid who along with Francisco Regordosa made up the directors board. They brought back the traditional crest and colors. In that position the coach [[RaÃºl CÃ¡rdenas]] didn't ask for any players from the draft and brought five players from [[Yugoslavia]] which were a disappointment. This tournament was the worst in the clubs history, with only 9 points in 2 victories, 3 draws, and 12 losses, with 13 goals in favor and 41 against. The club's lead scorer was Aleksandar Janjic with a couple of goals.

In the Summer of 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puebla80s.blogspot.com/2009/06/equipo-puebla-1998-1999.html|title=Clubs stats and starting line up from 1998-1999|language=Spanish Blogspot by Carlos Moreno |accessdate=2009 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wTMgeR6u |archivedate = 2011-02-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the story wasn't different from the last years. Alfredo Tena took over as coach and brought some reinforcements as MartÃ­n Ubaldi, FranÃ§ois Omam Biyik, RubÃ©n Ruiz DÃ­az, and Miguel Pardeza. Puebla didn't improve and Tena was replace by JosÃ© Mari Bakero as coach. The team played worse and in the last round they tied against [[Club de FÃºtbol Monterrey|Monterrey]] and were relegated to the second division for the second time since 1964 when the club was formed. The numbers were 3 victories, 4 ties and 10 losses with 15 goals for and 30 against for a total of 13 points.

'''UniÃ³n de Curtidores purchase'''

When everyone thought that Puebla would play in second division, during the league's draft it was announced the sell of [[Club LeÃ³n|LeÃ³n]] by Valente Aguirre to Francisco Bernat, who on June 21 announced that [[Club LeÃ³n|LeÃ³n]] was going to convert into Puebla F.C. Valente Aguirre said that there was no way Leon was moving out of [[Guanajuato]]. In response, Francisco Bernat said ''if we bought the club was to move it to [[Puebla]], we're from Puebla and its our duty to our fans to have a club in first division... now, if they want the club to remain in Leon they'll have to pay us the 9 millions that we paid''.  That situation gave way to an uproar from the supporters of Leon who didn't want to the their disappearing. On June 23&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puebla80s.blogspot.com/2009/06/equipo-puebla-1999.html|title=Clubs stats and UniÃ³n de Curtidores purchase from 1999-2000|language=Spanish Blogspot by Carlos Moreno |accessdate=2009 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wTMiQsvw |archivedate = 2011-02-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it was announced that Puebla would remain in first division, also that Leon would remain in [[Leon, Mexico|Leon]] by purchasing [[UniÃ³n de Curtidores]], the other team based in Leon.

===All time top goalscorers===
Since 1950s, when [[Ricardo Ãlvarez (Mexican footballer)|Ricardo Alvarez]] scored his 86th and last goal with the club, no one else has accomplished this feat. It was on May 21, 1959 when Alvarez scored his last goals with Puebla before leaving the club to join [[Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz|Veracruz]]. [[Ricardo Ãlvarez (Mexican footballer)|Ricardo Alvarez]] left a record of 86 goals in 125 games through a career that spanned 5 years. Half a century later, the name of  &quot;La Changa&quot; Alvarez is still the best goal scorer ever in the history of Puebla F.C. in first division. Even with the clubs constancy in first division, playing a total of 54 championships, no other player has reached Alvarez's number of goals scored and only one player has obtained the league goal scoring title in 1996.

It was the Spanish [[Carlos Antonio MuÃ±oz Cobo|Carlos MuÃ±oz]] who gave Puebla F.C. their only one goal scoring title in 1996 with 15 goals. Thanks to 4 good tournaments, [[Carlos Antonio MuÃ±oz Cobo|Carlos MuÃ±oz]] placed himself in the list of the best goal scorers in the club's history but still far from the 86 scored by Ricardo Alvarez.
Two players were close to beat Alvarez's record: [[Silvio Fogel]] in The 1970s and  [[Carlos Poblete]] in the 1980s. [[Silvio Fogel]] scored 84 goals and now is the scoring runner-up in Puebla's history. Carlos Poblete scored 83 and now is third place in the all time scoring list. [[Carlos Poblete]] is at the top of the list in goals scored in playoffs with 15 goals scored.  [[Carlos Poblete]] and Silvio scored over 100 goals each one, but this was done playing with different clubs. And [[Ricardo Ãlvarez (Mexican footballer)|Ricardo Alvarez]] did the same scoring 113 goals in his career playing for Puebla F.C., [[Moctezuma de Orizaba|Moctezuma]], and [[Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz|Veracruz]].
