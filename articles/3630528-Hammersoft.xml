'''Alou Diarra''' ({{IPA-fr|alu djaÊa}}) (born 15 July 1981 in [[Villepinte, Seine-Saint-Denis|Villepinte]]) is a [[List of France international footballers|French international footballer]] who currently plays for French club [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in [[Ligue 1]]. He primarily plays as a [[Midfielder|defensive midfielder]], but can also deputized as a [[Defender (football)|centre back]] if necessary. Diarra is described as a player who is &quot;strong, athletic and very powerful&quot; and possesses a &quot;combative edge&quot; similar to former [[France national football team|French international]] [[Patrick Vieira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/jan/05/newsstory.sport4  | title = Wenger weighs up Â£5m move for Liverpool cast-off Diarra |date = 5 January 2006 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matt | last=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra is also known for his leadership ability and has served as captain of both Bordeaux domestically and [[France national football team|France]] internationally.

Diarra began his career playing for clubs based in [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], such as CSL Aulnay and hometown club FC Villepinte. In 1997, he joined [[CS Louhans-Cuiseaux|Louhans-Cuiseaux]] and made his professional debut with the club in the [[1999â2000 French Division 2|1999â2000 season]] while the club was playing in the [[Ligue 2|second division]]. In 2000, Diarra was recruited by German club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. He spent two years playing on the club's reserve team, [[Bayern Munich II]]. In 2002, he was signed by compatriot [[GÃ©rard Houllier]] as part of the manager's ''French Revolution'' to play for English club [[Liverpool F.C|Liverpool]]. Diarra's stint at the club was deemed a disappointment as he spent both years at the club on loan in France playing for [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]], [[SC Bastia|Bastia]], and [[RC Lens|Lens]]. 

After a successful 2004â05 season with Lens, Diarra made a permanent return to France joining the club from Liverpool on a permanent deal. He spent two seasons at the club amassing over 70 appearances before signing with the then five-team defending champions [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]. At Lyon, Diarra struggled for playing time and left the club to join [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] after one year. He did earn a winner's medal as a result of the club winning the [[2006â07 Ligue 1]] title. With Bordeaux, Diarra was ever-present within the team under manager [[Laurent Blanc]]. He was a prominent figure on the Bordeaux team that won the [[The double|league and league cup double]] in the [[2008â09 Ligue 1|2008â09 season]]. Diarra has also won two [[TrophÃ©e des champions]] while playing for the club.

Diarra is also a [[France national football team|France international]]. Prior to playing at senior level, he played at [[France national under-20 football team|under-20]] and [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. With the under-20 team, Diarra played on the team that participated in the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. He made his senior international debut in October 2004 in a [[Exhibition match|friendly match]] against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]. Diarra has participated in both the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] editions of the [[FIFA World Cup]]. In the 2006 competition, he appeared in a group stage match against [[Togo national football team|Togo]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|the final match]] against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] as a substitute. In the 2010 edition, Diarra captained France for the first time in the team's final group stage match against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]].

== Personal life ==
Diarra was born in the [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[Villepinte, Seine-Saint-Denis|Villepinte]] in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] to [[Mali]]an parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_career&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.rmc.fr/editorial/111685/alou-diarra-le-perseverant/ | publisher=[[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] | title = Alou Diarra, le persÃ©vÃ©rant |date = 20 May 2010 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three younger brothers and one sister. One of his brothers, ZankÃ©, is also a footballer and currently plays for amateur club [[ES Viry-ChÃ¢tillon|Viry-ChÃ¢tillon]] in the [[Championnat de France amateur]], the fourth division of French football, after being released from the [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve team]] of professional club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. Another brother, Idrissa, assists in running a [[social networking]] site that helps amateur footballers find a club.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_family&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/zanke-diarra-dans-l-ombre-d-alou-29-12-2010-1205880.php |work=Le Parisien |location=France | title = ZankÃ© Diarra, dans l'ombre d'Alou |date = 29 December 2010| accessdate = 7 April 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra and his siblings were raised in the neighborhood of Rose des Vents located in the nearby commune of [[Aulnay-sous-Bois]], where his parents still reside.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_family&quot;/&gt; He is currently married and has two children. On 28 May 2010, ahead of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], Diarra departed the national team's training camp to be beside his wife as she gave birth to his second child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.footmercato.net/edf-alou-diarra-quitte-ses-partenaires_50119 | publisher=FootMercato | title = Alou Diarra quitte ses partenaires |date = 28 May 2010 | accessdate = 7 April 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club career ==
=== Early career ===
Diarra began his football career at hometown club CSL Aulnay.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_career&quot;/&gt; After six years in Aulnay, Diarra moved back to his birth city to join FC Villepinte. While in the youth academy of Villepinte, he struggled to attract the attention of professional clubs often personally contacting clubs in order to earn [[Evaluation|trials]]. Diarra was ultimately denied several opportunities, most notably by [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]] and, according to his brother, the struggle made the elder Diarra &quot;very motivated to succeed&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_career&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_career2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.rmc.fr/editorial/131388/diarra-juste-quelqu-un-de-bien/ | publisher=[[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] | title = Diarra, juste quelquâun de bienâ¦ |date = 20 October 2010 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Diarra was signed to an amateur contract by professional club [[CS Louhans-Cuiseaux]] who were playing in [[Ligue 2]], the second level of [[Football in France|French football]], and was inserted into the club's youth academy. In the 1998â99 season, Diarra was promoted to the club's reserve team and spent two seasons playing there. In the latter part of the [[1999â2000 French Division 2|1999â2000 season]], he was called up to the senior team by manager [[Philippe Hinschberger]]. On 15 April 2000, Diarra made his professional debut in a 2â1 defeat to [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]] picking up a [[Penalty card|yellow card]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/45708 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Louhans-Cuiseaux v. Toulouse Match Report |date = 15 April 2000 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, he made his first professional start in the team's 3â2 loss to [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Niort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/45660 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Louhans-Cuiseaux v. Niort Match Report |date = 29 April 2000 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final appearance with Louhans-Cuiseaux, Diarra received his first red card of his career after incurring two yellow card infractions in a 2â1 defeat to Le Mans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue2/feuille_match/45660 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Le Mans v. Louhans-Cuiseaux Match Report |date = 5 May 2000 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Louhans-Cuiseaux finished the campaign in last place and were relegated to the semi-professional [[Championnat National]], the third division of French football. After the season, Louhans-Cuiseaux attempted to tie down Diarra on a long-term deal and offered the player a trainee contract. Diarra refused the deal and was subsequently available to sign with any club on a [[Free transfer (football)|free transfer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_contract&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/media-watch/diarra-in-french-dispute | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra in French dispute  |date = 20 September 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany and England ===

[[File:GÃ©rard Houllier.jpg|thumb|175px|[[GÃ©rard Houllier]] recruited Diarra at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and later managed the player again at [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]].]]

During the summer of 2000, Diarra was signed by German club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] after the club saw him play one match with Louhans-Cuiseaux.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_career2&quot;/&gt; Upon his arrival to the club, he was immediately placed onto the club's reserve team, [[Bayern Munich II]], in the [[Regionalliga SÃ¼d]], the fourth level of [[Football in Germany|German football]]. Diarra was a regular within the team playing alongside the likes of [[Owen Hargreaves]], [[Philip Lahm]], [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], and [[Zvjezdan MisimoviÄ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_bayern&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2010/round=2000028/match=2000396/prematch/focus/index.html | publisher=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] | title = Diarra keeping plenty in reserve for Bayern |date = 21 October 2009 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season with the reserve team, he appeared in 28 matches scoring four goals. Diarra's influence in the team was immediate as he scored his first goal for the team in the first league match of the season against [[VfR Mannheim]] in a 4â2 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/regionalliga/sued/2001/1/bayernii-vfrmannheim/ | publisher=Fussballdaten | title = Spielstatistik FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen II â VfR Mannheim |date = 30 July 2000 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; His combative style of play also began to take shape as he collected nine yellow cards during the campaign with seven of them coming in the team's first 17 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fussballdaten.de/spieler/diarraalou/2001/#Regionalliga_Sued | publisher=Fussballdaten | title = Spiele als Spieler 2000/2001 |date = | accessdate = 7 April 2011 | language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season was ultimately a success for Diarra partly due to the player being promoted to the senior team for the [[2001â02 FuÃball-Bundesliga|2001â02 season]] by manager [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]]. He was assigned the number 30 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.geocities.ws/rien0101/0102.htm | publisher=[[Geocities]] | title = Team of 2001/2002 |date = | accessdate = 7 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarra began the 2001â02 season by making the bench in several of the team's league matches in August and September, but failing to make an appearance. In October 2001, he was dropped back down to the club's reserve team and appeared in four matches before earning promotion back to the senior team for its [[2001 Intercontinental Cup]] showdown with [[Argentina|Argentine]] club [[Boca Juniors]]. Diarra made the bench for the match, but did not feature as Bayern won the match courtesy of an extra time goal from [[Samuel Kuffour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid=510885.html#toyota+cup+2001 | publisher=[[FIFA|FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association]] | title = Toyota Cup 2001 |date = 27 November 2001 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victory gave Diarra his first major honour of his career. Afterwards, he returned to the reserve team and later suffered an injury, which required a lengthy absence.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_bild&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.bild.de/sport/fussball/bayern-muenchen/bayern-amateur-jetzt-bordeaux-kapitaen-10165790.bild.html | publisher=[[Bild]] | title = Bayern verdient bei jedem Diarra-Wechsel |date = 21 October 2009 | accessdate = 2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra rejoined the team in March 2002 under new manager [[Hermann Gerland]] and made nine more appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_bild&quot;/&gt; Following the season, Diarra was offered a new three-year contract with the club, but rejected it citing his limited playing time.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_bild&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_liverpool&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-11-useless-facts-you-must-know | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra: 11 useless facts you must know!  |date = 10 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his disappointing stint with Bayern, which included failing to make an appearance with the club's senior team, in 2009, Diarra stated &quot;I have very fond memories of my time in Bayern&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_bayern&quot;/&gt; Following Diarra's success at [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], Bayern's general manager [[Uli HoeneÃ]] admitted that Diarra's rise to prominence as a footballer is &quot;one of the seven wonders of the world&quot;. HoeneÃ admitted that he was surprised by Diarra's resurgence stating &quot;If somebody had told me [he would return for a UEFA Champions League game] five years ago and made a bet with me, I would have lost a fortune&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_bayern&quot;/&gt; Since Diarra departing the club in 2002, due to [[FIFA]] compensation laws, Bayern have recouped over â¬800,000 as a result of the player's future transfers.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_bild&quot;/&gt;

On 3 July 2002, English club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] confirmed its interest in signing Diarra under the guidance of manager [[GÃ©rard Houllier]] who had likened the player to [[Patrick Vieira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/liverpool-confirm-interest-in-diarra | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Liverpool confirm interest in Diarra  |date = 3 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liverpool were also in competition with [[Italy|Italian]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and several French clubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_liverpool&quot;/&gt; On 9 July, Liverpool confirmed that the club had signed the player from Bayern Munich. Diarra agreed to a five-year contract and made his club debut against [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] during the club's pre-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/houllier-swoops-for-midfielder | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Houllier swoops for midfielder   |date = 9 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-makes-reds-debut | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra makes Reds debut  |date = 19 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day after the match against Le Havre, it was reported that Diarra was on a verge of a loan move to the same club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-loan-move-a-possibility | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra loan move a possibility  |date = 20 July 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August, the loan was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-loan-deal-done | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra loan deal done  |date = 1 August 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Loan stints in France

Diarra made his debut for Le Havre on 17 August 2002 in the team's 1â1 draw with [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] appearing as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/47521 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Strasbourg v. Le Havre Match Report |date = 17 August 2002 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a frequent starter for the majority of the fall season, but, following the winter break, began appearing primarily as a substitute. In September 2002, Diarra's contract dispute with Louhans-Cuiseaux came into the spotlight after his former club admitted that the player was reportedly banned from playing in France professionally for three years due to moving abroad without Louhans-Cuiseaux receiving a trainers' compensation fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;alou_contract&quot;/&gt; Louhans-Cuiseaux reported the situation to [[FIFA]], however, the organization ruled in favor of Diarra who was allowed to continue his career with Le Havre. Diarra scored his first professional goal on 25 January 2003 in a 2â1 defeat to [[Stade Lavallois|Laval]] in the [[Coupe de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-on-target-for-le-havre | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra on target for Le Havre |date = 26 January 2003| accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the campaign with 28 total appearances.

In the 2003 off-season, Diarra admitted that he would love to return to Liverpool stating &quot;I'm someone who is ambitious and I hope to win my place at Anfield next season&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-hoping-for-anfield-return | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra hoping for Anfield return |date = 19 June 2003| accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2003, Houllier confirmed that Diarra would remain in France on loan, this time with [[Corsica]]n club [[SC Bastia|Bastia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-set-for-another-loan-spell | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra set for another loan spell  |date = 15 June 2003| accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrival to the club, Diarra was inserted as a starter by manager [[GÃ©rard Gili]] and paid immediate dividends scoring in back-to-back weeks in a 4â2 win against [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] and a 4â1 loss to [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48102 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Bastia v.

After the season, Diarra returned to Liverpool for pre-season training, however, not under the guidance of his recruiter Houllier, but under Spanish coach [[Rafael BenÃ­tez]]. As a result, he was, for the third consecutive season, linked with a loan move.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/media-watch/lens-eye-diarra-loan-move | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Lens eye Diarra loan move  |date = 23 July 2004 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His non-inclusion on the club's roster for its North America tour meant a loan move was inevitable and, on 27 July 2004, he was loaned to [[RC Lens|Lens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-set-to-go-out-on-loan-again | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra set to go out on loan again |date = 27 July 2004 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar to his stint at Bastia, Diarra was included in the team as a starter by coach [[JoÃ«l Muller]]. The season was a major success for Diarra as he was the only player in the team to start every league match he played for the club. He also served as captain for a majority of the season. His consistent performances led to his call up to the senior national team. Diarra scored his first goal of the campaign in a 1â1 draw with [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]]. He scored the goal in the opening minute of the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48934 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Lens v.

Diarra also collected 11 yellow cards.

=== Return to France ===
After establishing himself as a premier player in France and an international during the 2004â05 campaign, BenÃ­tez declared that Diarra still had a future at Liverpool stating &quot;I think it's still early days for him, but it's good news for us to see a young player doing so well. If he continues to play well for his club and is in the national team, we will be reminding everyone he is our player&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/rafa-diarra-can-have-a-future-here | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Rafa: Diarra can have a future here   |date = 14 October 2004 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in April 2005, Diarra revealed that he wanted to stay with Lens for the long-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-i-want-to-stay-at-lens | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra: I want to stay at Lens  |date = 19 April 2005 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing the season, on 24 June 2005, Liverpool granted his request after Lens reached an agreement with the club on a transfer fee, purported to be â¬3.2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/lens-agree-terms-for-diarra | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Lens agree terms for Diarra  |date = 24 June 2005 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra finished his Liverpool career with no first-team appearances and only one club appearance, which came in a pre-season friendly.

Diarra remained a starter at Lens and also retained his consistency appearing in a career-high 44 matches, scoring two goals, and providing four assists. His two goals came in a 2â1 away win over [[AS Nancy|Nancy]] and a 2â2 draw with [[OGC Nice|Nice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49702 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Nancy v.

He made his European debut on 3 July 2005 in a [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] second round tie against [[Poland|Polish]] club [[Lech PoznaÅ]]. Diarra ultimately appeared in ten matches in the club's European campaign as Lens reached the Round of 32 where the club was defeated 3â1 on aggregate by Italian outfit [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]].

=== Lyon ===
Following the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], Diarra was linked with a move to the then five-team defending champions [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] where he could reunite with former manager GÃ©rard Houllier. On 23 August 2006, the move came to fruition following the departure of Diarra's namesake, [[Mahamadou Diarra|Mahamadou]], who moved to Spanish club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for a fee of â¬26&amp;nbsp;million. The transfer fee was priced at â¬6.25&amp;nbsp;million and Diarra was assigned the number 18 shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11679_2387320,00.html | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | title = Diarra agrees Lyon move |date = 23 August 2006 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra struggled to make an impact at the club as Houllier preferred the younger [[JÃ©rÃ©my Toulalan]] and [[Tiago Mendes]] as his starting defensive midfielder and box-to-box midfielder, respectively. He made his club debut late in the season on 16 September 2006 in the team's 3â1 away win over [[FC Lorient|Lorient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/50570 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Lorient v.

The match ended in a 1â1 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=2006/round=2357/match=1116403/index.html | publisher=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] | title = Steaua denied by Diarra strike |date = 6 December 2006 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, he scored his second goal in the team's 3â1 win over Nancy in the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] quarterfinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/51293 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Lyon v.

Following the winter break, Diarra struggled with a thigh injury and didn't appear with the team for almost three months. In March 2007, he finally returned to the team in its 3â1 win over [[Derby du RhÃ´ne]] rivals [[AS Saint-Ãtienne|Saint-Ãtienne]] appearing as a substitute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/50855 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Saint-Ãtienne v.

Diarra refused the orders and Houllier responded by reportedly threatening not to play him for the rest of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11806_2410543,00.html | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | title = Diarra in Houllier spat |date = 7 April 2007 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lyon manager later stated the Diarra should issue an apology to him and the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11806_2410917,00.html | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | title = Diarra spats with Houllier |date = 11 April 2007 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The defensive midfielder did not budge and, subsequently, missed the team's next four league matches, as well as the [[2007 Coupe de la Ligue Final]].

Included in one of those three matches was Diarra's first league goal for the club, which came in a 3â0 victory over his former club Lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/50804 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Lyon v.

=== Bordeaux ===
==== 2006â2009 ====
[[File:Alou Diarra.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Diarra during a training session with Bordeaux.]]

After the 2006â07 season with Lyon, Diarra sought to play for another club and was linked primarily to English clubs [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. In July 2007, Lyon president [[Jean-Michel Aulas]] confirmed that the club had accepted a bid of [[British pound|Â£]]5&amp;nbsp;million from Portsmouth. However, Aulas also revealed that Diarra refused the move and preferred to stay in France and join Bordeaux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11674_2595761,00.html | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | title = Diarra snubbed Pompey chance |date = 18 July 2007 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 July, after a week-long negotiation, Bordeaux confirmed the signing of Diarra. The midfielder signed a four-year contract and the transfer fee was priced at â¬7.75&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11806_2410917,00.html | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | title = Diarra opts for Bordeaux |date = 20 July 2007 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra stated his primary reason for joining Bordeaux over Portsmouth was because Bordeaux &quot;wants to play for the first positions in Ligue 1 and I am attracted to that&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11674_2610234,00.html | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | title = Diarra reveals Pompey snub |date = 13 July 2007 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra was signed as a replacement for the departed [[Rio Mavuba]] who ventured to Spain. His arrival to the club also coincided with the insertion of former football player [[Laurent Blanc]] as manager.

Diarra was assigned the number 4 shirt and made his competitive debut for the club on 4 August 2007 in a 1â0 league win over his former club Lens receiving a yellow card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51301 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Bordeaux v.

Bordeaux Match Report |date = 29 August 2007 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra was a regular within the starting lineup for the entire season starting all 36 league matches he appeared in. He formed excellent midfield partnerships with box-to-box midfielders [[Alejandro Alonso (footballer)|Alejandro Alonso]] and [[Fernando Menegazzo]] who gave Diarra the freedom to distribute the ball and dismantle impending attacks from the opposition. On 2 December, Diarra scored a goal in Bordeaux's 4â3 win over [[Derby de la Garonne]] rivals Toulouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51420 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Bordeaux v. Toulouse Match Report |date = 2 December 2007 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Diarra also participated in European competition with Bordeaux during the season. He played in four matches during the club's UEFA Cup campaign. Bordeaux reached the Round of 32 where the club was eliminated by [[Belgium|Belgian]] club [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] on a 3â2 aggregate scoreline. In the [[Coupe de France]], Bordeaux reached the quarter-finals. Diarra appeared in all four matches the team contested, which included playing 120 minutes in back-to-back rounds. He scored two more goals for the club; both of which came in the league in wins over Metz and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51483 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Bordeaux v.

It was the closest gap Lyon had endured since the [[2003â04 Ligue 1|2003â04 season]] when the club won the league by three points over Paris Saint-Germain. Diarra finished the season with 44 total appearances and four goals.

In the [[2008â09 Ligue 1|2008â09 season]], Diarra remained a starter as Bordeaux was boosted by the arrival of the influential [[Yoann Gourcuff]]. He appeared in Bordeaux's 5â4 win on penalties in the [[2008 TrophÃ©e des Champions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/tropheeChampions/feuille_match/53019 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Bordeaux v.

Included in those matches was Diarra's first red card for the club, which came in a 1â0 win over Grenoble after he collected two yellow cards. The two infractions came within a span of five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/52246 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Grenoble v.

Diarra missed the final match due to injury, but did play in the semi-final match, a 3â0 win over Paris Saint-Germain, that resulted in Bordeaux qualifying for the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/53018 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Paris Saint-Germain v.

On 19 April 2009, Diarra scored the only goal in Bordeaux's 1â0 win over title rivals Lyon at the [[Stade de Gerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/52485 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Lyon v.

Bordeaux, subsequently, went on a six-match winning streak to close out the season, which resulted in the club capturing the sixth title in its history and its first since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/jun/01/bordeaux-laurent-blanc-french-football  | title = Bordeaux claim Ligue 1 title to justify faith in Laurent Blanc |date = 1 June 2009 | accessdate = 7 April 2011 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ben | last=Lyttleton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bordeaux also recorded its second ever [[The Double|double]], as a result of its league cup title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.football365.fr/france/coupe-de-la-ligue/article_313013_Les-Girondins-atomisent-le-VOC.shtml | publisher=Football365 | title = Les Girondins atomisent le VOC |date = 25 April 2009 | accessdate = 7 April 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra finished the season with a career-high 45 total appearances and three goals.

Ahead of the [[2009â10 Ligue 1|2009â10 season]], following the replacement of captain [[Ulrich RamÃ©]] as the starting goalkeeper, Blanc tipped Diarra as his replacement to wear the armband. He began the season claiming his fourth silverware with Bordeaux on 25 July 2009, winning the [[2009 TrophÃ©e des Champions]] title in a 2â0 victory over [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/tropheeChampions/feuille_match/53542 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Bordeaux v.

Prior to the start of the [[2010â11 in French football|2010â11 season]], Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]].

He was supported by his former coach Laurent Blanc who stated that Diarra made a simple mistake that he immediately regretted as soon as he realized what he did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_6454289,00.html | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | title = Blanc â Go easy on Diarra |date = 19 October 2010 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra was initially suspended for three matches, however, following a November tribunal by the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]], his suspension was upgraded to six matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2010-10-21-4045515963_x.htm |work=USA Today  | title = Bordeaux's Alou Diarra suspended for ref shove |date = 21 October 2010 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_6488432,00.html | publisher=[[Sky Sports]] | title = Diarra handed six-game ban |date = 5 November 2010 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra returned to the team on 27 November playing only the first half in the team's 1â1 draw with Lille.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/53766 | publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] | title = Bordeaux v.

=== Marseille ===

On 4 July 2011, Diarra completed his much-anticipated move from Bordeaux to league rivals [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] agreeing to a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.om.net/fr/Saison/101002/Actualites/54591/Alou_Diarra_a_signe_a_l_OM | publisher=[[Olympique de Marseille]] | title = Alou Diarra a signÃ© Ã  l'OM  |date = 4 July 2011 | accessdate = 4 July 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer fee was undisclosed, but is reported to be in the region of â¬5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=1648864.html|title=Marseille move for Bordeaux's Diarra|date=4 July 2011|accessdate=4 July 2011 |publisher=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International career ==
=== Youth ===
Diarra is a former [[France national youth football team|French youth international]] having earned caps at [[France national under-20 football team|under-20]] and [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. He earned his first international youth call up in 2001 by coach [[Raymond Domenech]] ahead of the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]]. Diarra played in the first group stage match; a 5â0 hammering of [[Iran national football team|Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=104/edition=4295/matches/match=22022/report.html | publisher=[[FIFA|FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association]] | title = Iran â France |date = 18 June 2001 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 30th minute of the match against Iran, Diarra was substituted out due to an injury. The injury was deemed severe and Diarra missed the rest of the tournament. France ultimately crashed out of the competition in the quarter-finals losing 3â1 to a [[Javier Saviola]]-led [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina]]. Diarra's only other confirmed appearance with the under-20 team was in a 1â0 win over [[Egypt national under-20 football team|Egypt]] in April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fff.fr/selections/20ans/22748.shtml | publisher=[[French Football Federation]] | title = Du minimum Ã  l'essentiel (1â0) |date = 17 April 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarra earned his first call up to the under-21 team in August 2002 for a friendly match against [[Cyprus national under-21 football team|Cyprus]]. He made his debut in the match as France cruised to a 1â0 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fff.fr/selections/espoirs/actualite/32306.shtml | publisher=[[French Football Federation]] | title = Les Bleuets assurent l'essentiel (1â0) |date = 17 April 2002 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra featured regularly within the team as France attempted to qualify for both the [[2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]] and the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics â Men's tournament|football tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics]]. France failed to qualify for both competitions, which resulted in the end of Diarra's youth career. He appeared in 10 competitive matches with the team and scored his only goal in a 3â1 UEFA U21 tournament qualification win over [[Israel national under-21 football team|Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/under21/history/season=2004/round=1585/match=69094/index.html | publisher=[[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] | title = Israel v. France Match Report |date = 1 April 2003 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2003, Diarra was called up to the [[Mali national football team|Mali national team]] to participate in the [[2004 Africa Cup of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/3337043.stm | publisher=[[BBC|BBC Sport]] | title = Kanoute named in Mali squad |date = 20 December 2003 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diarra turned down the opportunity to represent the nation of his parents in order to continue his career with his home country France.

=== Senior ===

On 13 August 2004, Diarra was named to the [[France national football team|senior national team]] for the first time by Domenech to participate in a friendly match against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/cisse-and-diarra-named-in-france-squad | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Cisse and Diarra named in France squad  |date = 13 August 2004 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not make his debut in the match, but was named to the team again in October for [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches against the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-shines-in-france | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra shines in France  |date = 4 October 2004 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Diarra earn his debut cap in the match against Ireland appearing as a substitute for [[Olivier Dacourt]] in a 0â0 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/latest-news/diarra-makes-french-debut | publisher=[[Liverpool F.C.]] | title = Diarra makes French debut   |date = 10 October 2004 | accessdate = 4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured with the team heavily in World Cup qualification primarily as a substitute for either Patrick Vieira or [[Claude MakÃ©lÃ©lÃ©]] and, following France's qualification for the tournament, was named to the team to participate in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/304080.shtml | publisher=[[French Football Federation]] | title = Les &quot;Mondialistes&quot; en chiffres |date = 14 May 2006 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the competition, Diarra appeared in two matches. He appeared as a substitute for Vieira in the team's final group stage match against [[Togo national football team|Togo]] and repeated this in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]] against [[Italy national football team|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/results/matches/match=97410045/report.html | publisher=[[FIFA|FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association]] | title = Togo â France |date = 23 June 2006 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/results/matches/match=97410064/report.html | publisher=[[FIFA|FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association]] | title = Italy â France |date = 9 July 2006 | accessdate = 3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; France lost the final 5â3 in a penalty shootout, which Diarra did not participate in.

After appearing in a November 2006 friendly match against [[Greece national football team|Greece]], Diarra was absent from the national team for nearly two years, partly due to his struggle for playing time in [[Lyon]]. As a result, he missed [[UEFA Euro 2008]], although he was named to the competition's preliminary squad. After regaining his form at Bordeaux, Diarra began making his way back into the team and participated in seven [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying]] matches. He was later selected to participate in his second consecutive FIFA World Cup. France endured a disastrous campaign as the players went on strike in response to its disagreement over the expulsion of [[striker]] [[Nicolas Anelka]] from the team. In the team's final group stage match against hosts [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]], with several veteran players missing from the squad, Diarra was rewarded with the captaincy for the first time in his international career and led the team to a 2â1 loss, which resulted in its elimination from the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alou Diarra, bon capitaine&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.sport.fr/football/l-equipe-de-france-de-football-alou-diarra-bon-capitaine-199078.shtm | publisher=Football365 | title = Alou Diarra, bon capitaine? |date = 11 October 2010 | accessdate = 4 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.girondins.com/diarra-capitaine-en-bleu.html | publisher=[[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]] | title = Diarra â Capitaine en bleu |date = 22 June 2010 | accessdate = 3 March 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Diarra was one of several players retained by incoming coach [[Laurent Blanc]], his former manager. After missing the August 2010 friendly due to suspension, he returned to the team in September playing the entire match in 2â0 wins over both Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Diarra served as captain in both matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.rmc.fr/editorial/125426/a-diarra-capitaine-valbuena-titulaire/ | publisher=[[Radio Monte Carlo|RMC Sport]] | title = A.
