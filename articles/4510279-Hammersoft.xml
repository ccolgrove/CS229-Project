'''Blake Anthony Foster''' (born May 29, 1985) is an American actor and martial artist.

Foster was born in [[Northridge, California]], the son of Patricia and John Foster.  

Foster was the ''[[Huggies]]'' baby at the age of sixteen months in 1986. He is perhaps best known for his role as [[Justin Stewart]], the child who assumed the mantle of the Blue Turbo Ranger in the fifth season of [[Power Rangers]], ''[[Power Rangers: Turbo]]'', making his debut for the show in the movie ''[[Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= TV Playbook: ''Let's Add a Kid!''|work=IGN|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/935/935812p5.html|accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foster reprised the role in an episode of ''[[Power Rangers: In Space]]'', wrapping up plot holes left behind from his abrupt departure at the conclusion of ''Turbo''. Foster made appearances at the 2009 [[Anime Expo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anime-expo.org/archive/ax2009-guests/ax2009-power-ranger-industry-guests/ Power Ranger Industry Guests]&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2010 [[Power Morphicon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officialpowermorphicon.com/guests/ Power Morphicon Guests]&lt;/ref&gt; At both events he reunited with his former ''Power Rangers'' co-stars [[Selwyn Ward]], [[Roger Velasco]], [[Patricia Ja Lee]] (Only Anime Expo) and [[Tracy Lynn Cruz]] (Only Power Morphicon).
