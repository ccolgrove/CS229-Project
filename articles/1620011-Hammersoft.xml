The '''First Nations University of Canada (FNUniv) ''' (formerly '''Saskatchewan Indian Federated College''') is a university in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]] with campuses in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]], and [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. The Regina campus building was designed by architect [[Douglas Cardinal]].

==Basic information==
{{Weasel|date=April 2010}}{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
Although it is called the First Nations University of Canada (FNUniv) and is recognized as a university by the Saskatchewan Government, the institution is actually a  federated college of the University of Regina (U of R), and its  degrees  are recognized as U of R degrees. The enabling legislation is ''An Act Respecting the University of Regina, Chapter U-5.'' &lt;ref&gt; http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/publications/index.cfm?fuseaction=details&amp;c=2036&amp;id=2  ''The University of Regina Act.'' &lt;/ref&gt; 

The top two and a half floors of its Regina campus building are leased as office space to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) who assist and oversee daily operations of the university.   

FNUniv students at the Regina campus pay regular U of R related and University of Regina Student Union  fees. Like the other federated colleges of Luther and Campion, FNUniv students may utilize all of the U of R facilities (libraries, book stores, clubs, parking, labs, etc.) and services (meal plans, residences, web/on-line services, career counselling, etc.).  The FNUniv degree programs are correlated  with the rest of the U of R curriculum.

FNUniv is open to students of all cultures and nationalities and not restricted only to those of First Nations descent.

==History==

[[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]] opened the university in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{Cquote2|This stone was taken from the grounds of Balmoral Castle in the Highlands of Scotland â a place dear to my great great grandmother, Queen Victoria.

[[Star Blanket Cree Nation]] has proposed a plan to declare the institution's property an [[Urban Indian reserve]] under a Saskatchewan Treaty Land Entitlement Agreement involving Star Blanket, the provincial and federal governments. Band members of the Star Blanket Nation unanimously voted in favour of this plan during a 2008 referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2008/17/c9836.html | accessdate=2008-05-17 | title=100 per cent Vote in Favour of Urban Reserve Proposal | date=17 May 2008 | publisher=[[CNW Group]] | author=First Nations University of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saskatchewan Indian Federated College was affiliated  from the first with the [[University of Regina]].  It was founded in 1976 by an agreement between the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations and the University of Regina, with the stated intent of serving &quot;the academic, cultural and spiritual needs of First Nations' students&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sasknetwork.gov.sk.ca/html/Learners/educationtraining/federatedcolleges.htm SaskNetWork - Federated Colleges&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal programs==
The university  designed special programs in partnership with Aboriginal communities to meet the human resource needs of Aboriginal communities in areas such as health, education and the environment - examples include its National School of Dental Therapy, Nursing and Health Studies programs. A special first-year bridging programs for Aboriginal students is provided, with  Aboriginal Elders present on campus to provide social supports. FNUniv offers a comprehensive career services program to meet the vocational problems of Aboriginal students.  .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Controversies==
===Professional standing===
In May 2007, the university was put on probation by the [[Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada|AUCC]], following a controversy in February 2005, in which the university fired a number of staff members. The association demanded the university establish full independence from the [[Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations]] within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The university complied with the AUCC directives, and was reinstated in April 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;plans&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In November 2008, the [[Canadian Association of University Teachers]] voted unanimously to censure FNUniv and asked its members not accept jobs, honours or awards at the university. Changes made relating to academic freedom, governance and political autonomy were reported to be reason for the censure vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Financial support===
In October 2008, the government of Saskatchewan gave the university [[Canadian dollar|$]]1.6 million to relieve a chronic budget deficit. The money was given to cover salaries of faculty and operating expenses. Another $400,000 was to be spent on a review of the university's long-term operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In February 2009, the provincial government withheld $200,000 of funding. Lack of progress in solving the institution's problems was cited as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However, on   March 23, 2010, the province of Saskatchewan restored funding. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Saskatchewan-Restores-Support/22013/?sid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en|title=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2010-07-11|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, the federal government announced the provision of $4 million of support in response to the changes in governance that were underway; however, these funds would be administered on behalf of FNUniv by the University of Regina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/troubled-first-nations-university-gets-4-million-lifeline-from-ottawa/article1590073/|title= Troubled First Nations University gets $4-million lifeline from Ottawa|date=2010-05-02|accessdate=2010-09-11|location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail|first=Jennifer|last=Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, it was discovered that nearly $400,000 of the FNUniv's scholarship fund had been spent on general operations. The fund had dwindled from $390,000 in spring 2009 to just $15,000 in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On June 9th 2011, Wesley Robert Stevenson, a former top official with FNUC, plead guilty to charges of fraud. Between January and March of 2005 Stevenson spent $15000 from the Canadian Federal government (originally intended for a FNUC trip to Scotland) on a 'working holiday' for himself as well as other FNUC expenses. The CBC reported that Stevenson had already made full restitution before pleading guilty. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
