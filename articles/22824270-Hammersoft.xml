The '''2009â10 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team''' represented the [[University of Connecticut]] in the 2009â2010 [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I]] basketball season. The Huskies were coached by [[Geno Auriemma]], as the Huskies played their home games at the [[XL_Center#The_Veterans_Memorial_Coliseum|Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in the  [[XL Center]] located in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and on campus at the [[Harry A. Gampel Pavilion]] in [[Storrs, Connecticut]]. The Huskies are a member of the [[Big East Conference]] and won their seventh NCAA championship against Stanford on April 6, 2010.

==Regular season==
===Pre-season===
The Connecticut team opened the year ranked #1 in both the ESPN Coaches poll and the AP Top 25 Poll , following a 39â0 record leading to a National Championship in the prior season.&lt;ref name=&quot;preseason polls&quot;/&gt; In both cases, the polling results were unanimous. UConn graduated three seniors, Renee Montgomery, Tahirah Williams and Cassie Kerns, but only Renee was a regular starter. The team added one freshman, Kelly Faris, and Caroline Doty returned to the line-up after missing most of the prior season due to injury.

The two preseason games were wins against '''[[The College of Saint Rose|St. Rose College]]'''(85â44) and '''[[Vanguard University of Southern California|Vanguard]]''' (98â68).

===Non-conference games===
The defending national champions opened their season against '''[[Northeastern University|Northeastern]]'''. The outcome of the game was never in doubt, with a final score of 105â35; the game was more about personal accomplishments than the game itself. Senior Tina Charles pulled down her 1000th career rebound while senior Kalana Greene scored her 1000th career point. The win would continue a consecutive streak started the previous year, then at 40 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northeastern&quot;/&gt;
The game against '''[[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]]''', played in San Antonio, the location of this season's Final Four, was expected to be competitive, as Texas was ranked tenth in the nation by the AP. However, UConn pulled out to a 21 point lead by halftime, and ended up winning by 25, 83â58.&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas&quot;/&gt;

Connecticut's next game against '''[[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]]''' would mark the 20th game between the two teams, an annual competition going back to the 1985â86 season. At the start of the series, the schools were competitive, with the teams splitting the first four meetings. However, UConn has not lost since, and entered the game with a 17â2 series record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holy Cross1&quot;/&gt; UConn prevailed 87â34.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holy Cross2&quot;/&gt;

After the WBCA Classic, UConn would play '''[[University of Vermont|Vermont]]'''  in a rematch of the previous year's NCAA opening round game. UConn won easily 84â42, on a night in which senior Tina Charles became the second leading rebounder in school history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vermont&quot;/&gt;

UConn's next opponent, '''[[University of Hartford|Hartford]]''', was coached by former UConn star [[Jennifer Rizzotti]]. Hartford had never beaten UConn, and this game would be no exception, with UConn winning 80â45 for the eleventh consecutive victory over the Hawks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hartford &quot;/&gt; In the next game, UConn easily beat '''[[Iona College (New York)|Iona]]''' 90â35.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iona&quot;/&gt;

The '''[[Stanford University|Stanford]]''' game was one of the most anticipated games of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anticipation&quot;/&gt; Both teams came into the game undefeated. UConn was ranked #1 in the AP writer's poll and the ESPN Coaches poll, while Stanford was ranked #2 in each poll.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rankings&quot;/&gt; Stanford's last loss was to UConn in the 2009 NCAA Final Four game, while UConn's last loss was to Stanford in the 2008 Final Four game.
UConn hadn't been behind in a game at halftime or later all season until this game, but Stanford entered halftime with a slim two point lead. However, after trading baskets early in the second half, UConn pulled out to a 22 point lead (74â52) with five minutes left in the game,&lt;ref name=&quot;Play by play&quot;/&gt; and coasted to their 49th consecutive victory, all of which were won with a double digit margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanford&quot;/&gt;

UConn ended the calendar year with a 78â59 victory over 11th ranked '''[[Florida State University|Florida State]]'''. The game was relatively close at halftime, 41â35, but UConn's Tina Charles scored 16 of her 24 points in the second half to help ensure a victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Florida State&quot;/&gt;

UConn took a break from conference games to play a home game against the '''[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]'''(UNC).{{Rquote|left|The first half wasn't just the best basketball Connecticut played; it might have been the best basketball it can play.|Graham Hays|&lt;ref name=&quot;Hays&quot;/&gt;}} At the time, UNC was ranked seventh in the country. Despite the prospect of a close game, it was never close. Tina Charles scored 25 points in the first half, single-handedly outscoring the entire UNC team. UConn lead at halftime 56â24, and go on to win by 41 points, 88â47. ESPN's Graham Hays called &quot;the first-half play as good as it gets&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNC&quot;/&gt;

Connecticut had played [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] teams Florida State and North Carolina; on 18 January, they would play their third ACC team of the season, '''[[Duke University|Duke]]'''. Just as North Carolina had been ranked seventh at the time of the game, the Duke team was the seventh ranked team in the country. The margin of victory would not be as large as the UNC game, but it was still a convincing win, with UConn outscoring Duke 81â48. In contrast to the UNC game in which the first half was decision, Duke would remain reasonably close at halftime, down only ten, 38â28, but UConn would stretch out the lead in the second half. Maya Moore hit six three point field goals in the game, and Kalana Greene scored 18 points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duke&quot;/&gt;

Connecticut faced [[Oklahoma Sooners women's basketball|Oklahoma]] in a late, out-of-conference match-up on the 15th of February. Oklahoma was ranked 12th in the nation, but UConn had faced higher ranked opponents, and won relatively easily. Midway through the first half, it appeared UConn was heading for another easy win, as they had doubled the Sooners score 24â12. However, Oklahoma brought the game back to a two point margin at halftime, and took a one point lead in the second half. Five minutes later, UConn had opened up a ten point lead, and extended the lead to a final 16 point margin 76â60.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma MV&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oklahoma&quot;/&gt;

===WBCA Classic===
The WBCA Classic Tournament was held at the UConn campus 27â29 November 2009. Coach Geno Auriemma is the current president of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]]. The four teams participating in the three-day [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] event were host UConn, [[Hofstra University|Hofstra]], [[University of Richmond|Richmond]], and [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. Richmond beat Clemson 86â67 in the first game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond Clemson&quot;/&gt;  UConn easily beat '''Hofstra''' 91â46, but the game was notable for being Auriemma's 700th career win.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofstra&quot;/&gt; Auriemma reached 700 victories the fastest of any coach in Division I history, reaching the mark in his 822nd game.&lt;ref name=&quot;700 wins&quot;/&gt;

The following day, Clemson defeated Hofstra 69â68,&lt;ref name=&quot;Clemson Hofstra&quot;/&gt; while UConn defeated '''Richmond''' 86â37.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond &quot;/&gt; On the final day of the tournament, Richmond defeated Hofstra 42â41,&lt;ref name=&quot;Richmond Hofstra&quot;/&gt; while UConn won the tournament with their victory over '''Clemson''' 87â48.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clemson&quot;/&gt;

===Conference games===
UConn opened conference play against '''[[Seton Hall University|Seton Hall]]''' on 2 Jan 2010. Most away games against Seton Hall are played on campus, but this game was played at the [[Prudential Center]] in Newark. The result was never in doubt, as UConn won 91â24, their largest margin over a Big East team in seven years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton Hall&quot;/&gt; UConn's second conference game was at home against the '''[[University of South Florida]]'''. UConn started out with an 18â2 run, but Charles and Moore got into early foul trouble, and had to sit on the bench. Nevertheless, UConn had a double-digit lead at halftime, leading coach Auriemma to quip, &quot;This is the only place in America where you've got to apologize for being up 14 at halftime.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;USF&quot;/&gt;

UConn's next game, against '''[[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]]''', was notable more for the coaching match up than the game. After twelve years as an assistant coach at Connecticut and four years as a player, [[Jamelle Elliott]] took the head coaching job at Cincinnati. This would be the first match up between Cincinnati and Connecticut since Elliot left Connecticut. UConn won easily 83â51.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cincinnati&quot;/&gt;

UConn returned to Big east play after the UNC game with a game against '''[[Marquette University|Marquette]]''' at their arena. The game outcome wasn't in doubt, as Tina Charles had a double-double (23 points, 11 rebounds) leading to a 24 point halftime lead, and a final score of 68â43.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marquette&quot;/&gt;  The game was unusual for a rare coaching decision near the end of the game. UConn typically declines to attempt to score if the game result is not in doubt, and they are inbounding the ball with less than 30 seconds to play, preferring just to dribble out the end of the game. However, in this game, with 72 seconds on the clock, Coach Auriemma instructed  his player not to even cross half-court, deliberately accepting a shot clock violation and a turnover. The announcers were unsure of the reason at the time, but subsequent remarks by Auriemma clarified that he felt the officials were not doing enough to stop rough play, and he didn't want to  &quot;put his players into any more physical danger by crossing midcourt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marquette midcourt&quot;/&gt;

UConn's game against '''[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]''' on 16 January didn't tipoff until 9 pm, but the arena opened at 7:30 in the morning. The ESPN CollegeGame Day event, traditionally held at the campus on a men's basketball game, held its first ever College Game Day in connection with a women's basketball game. The campus, shut down for winter break, opened a day earlier than usual to allow students to return in time to attend GameDay. Thousands turned to be in the backdrop of the 10 am national coverage. Because the event occurred in the morning, the UConn team was able to participate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GameDay&quot;/&gt;
{{Rquote|right|Right now, if you took a poll of those award-voters who truly follow women's hoops, Charles likely would be the unanimous winner for national player of the year. And she should be.|Mechelle Voepel|&lt;ref name=&quot;Voepel on Charles&quot;/&gt;}}
The game in the evening would pit two undefeated teamsâUConn , ranked #1 in the country with a 16â0 record and Notre Dame, ranked #3 in the country, with a 15â0 record. Despite the closeness of the rankings, and records, the game would not be close. UConn pulled out to a 42â19 halftime lead, and coasted to a 24 point victory, winning 70â46.&lt;ref name=&quot;ND home&quot;/&gt; Tina Charles had a double-double (23 points, 13 rebounds), leading ESPN's Mechelle Voepel to call Charles &quot;another one of UConn's all-time greats&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voepel on Charles&quot;/&gt;

UConn continued their undefeated season with a win over '''[[Villanova]]''', 74â35. This marked the first ever start for senior Meghan Gardler. While seniors traditionally get a starting role on senior day, the Villanova game was played near Gardler's hometown of Springfield Pennsylvania. Many friends and family members were at the game to see her play. The team, which normally would travel by plane to Pennsylvania, took the train, just for the experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Villanova&quot;/&gt;

'''[[Rutgers University|Rutgers]]''' is known for its defense, but UConnâs defense would prove to be superior, as UConn held Rutgers to 36 points, while scoring 73.  Rutgers was the last team to beat UConn in the regular season, winning at their home in 2008, but on this day, the results would not be close.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rutgers&quot;/&gt; UConn next played '''[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]]''', but the story of the game was not the game result, which UConn won easily. 98â56, but the benchmark reached by Tina Charles, as she became only the sixth player in UConn history to score 2,000 points in her career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittsburgh&quot;/&gt;

The next conference opponent, '''[[West Virginia University|West Virginia]]''' would be ranked #8 in the country at the time of the game, but had already faced strong teams this season, and had beaten West Virginia by 30 points in the previous year. This yearâs final score of 80â47 would produce a wider margin, but with a halftime margin of only 12, and a lead dropping to single-digits a few minutes into the second half, the game outcome appeared more in doubt than the final score would indicate.&lt;ref name=&quot;West Virginia&quot;/&gt;

The last time Connecticut played '''[[University of Louisville|Louisville]]''', it was for the National Championship in April 2009. That game wasn't close, but this one would be less of a challenge. UConn tripled Louisville's first half scoring, leading to a 54â18 first half score, and cruised to a final score of 84â38.&lt;ref name=&quot;Louisville&quot;/&gt;

[[DePaul Blue Demons|DePaul]] was within nine points almost 15 minutes into the game, but Tiffnay Hayes and Tina Charles started scoring, each ending up with 19 points for the game. The halftime lead was 20, and UConn started the second half with an 11â1 run to put the game away. The final score was 95â62.&lt;ref name=&quot;DePaul&quot;/&gt;

Before the game against [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's]], Tina Charles was inducted into [[Huskies of Honor]], to reflect her position as one of the most significant figures in the history of the team. Despite the emotion, she scored 25 points and a career high 21 rebounds to help lead UConn over the 24th ranked Red Storm in one of the closest games of the year, with a final score of 66â52. Only the 12 point win over Stanford was closer than the 14 point win against St. John's.&lt;ref name=&quot;St. John's&quot;/&gt;

Connecticut did not have any  trouble against [[Providence College|Providence]] on the 20th of February, quickly building a 20 point lead and extending the lead in the second half, behind a career high points total of 26 from Tina Charles and 21 from Maya Moore. UConn has now won 237 consecutive victories against unranked opponents at home.&lt;ref name=&quot;Providence&quot;/&gt;  Connecticut would continue their winning streak against [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] four days later, when Maya Moore had a season high 38 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in an 87â66 victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Syracuse&quot;/&gt;

Connecticut played 11th ranked [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] with an opportunity to clinch the Big East regular season title. Tina Charles, who had tied her season high points total a week earlier, set a new season record with 33 points, hitting 14 of 16 shot. Seniors Kaili McLaren, Meghan Gardler and Jacquie Fernandes started the game along with Charles and Greene, to follow the tradition of starting seniors in their final home game. Although Georgetown started out strong, hitting three 3-pointers to take an early 9â4 lead, and extended it to 15â9, the largest deficit UConn has faced this season, the team retook the lead later in the first half and did not trail again, winning with a final score of 84â62.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgetown&quot;/&gt;

The last regular season game was a rematch against Notre Dame. The usual Big East schedule has two games against one opponentâfor several seasons, that opponent was Rutgers, but this season, it was the eighth ranked Notre Dame team. UConn won easily 76â51. Tina Charles set two UConn career records in the same game, becoming the all-time scoring leader, surpassing [[Nykesha Sales]]'s record of 2,178 and became the all-time rebound leader, surpassing [[Rebecca Lobo]]'s record of 1,268.&lt;ref name=&quot;ND away&quot;/&gt;

Big East

==Big East Tournament==
===Quarter-final===
The Big East Tournament started with first round action on Friday, 5 March 2010. By virtue of being one of the top four seeds, UConn earned a double-bye, with their first game scheduled in the quarterfinals on Sunday. Syracuse beat Seton Hall on Friday, then beat Providence on Saturday to earn the match up against the number one seeded team in the tournament.
The game would never be close, with UConn leading at the half 44â17, and ended with a 77â41 victory. UConn's Tina Charles would tie her career high with 34 points, while Maya Moore would score the 2000th point of her career, ending the game with 16 points, 14 rebounds  and 7 assists. The win would be UConn's 70th consecutive win, tying an NCAA Division I record for the longest winning streak in the history of women's college basketball, set by UConn in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;BETQuarter&quot;/&gt;

===Semi-Final===
UConn would break their own 70-game winning streak with a 59â44 victory over Notre Dame on March 8, 2010, earning their 71st straight victory; every single victory during their current streak has been by at least 10 points.  The Huskies will play in the Big East Championship game on March 9, 2010, which will be their last game before the NCAA Tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;BETSemi&quot;/&gt;

===Big East Championship Game===
UConn defeated West Virginia, 60â32, to improve their winning streak to 72 games, and making their season record 33â0.  [[Kalana Greene]]'s 15 points guided the Huskies to victory, and help her to earn the Most Outstanding Player award for the tournament. UConn closed the game on 27â4 run after leading 33â28 early in the second half.&lt;ref name=&quot;BETFinal&quot;/&gt;

===NCAA Basketball Tournament===
[[File:UConn women's basketball team at the White House 2010-05-17 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=White House ceremony commemorating the 2010 NCAA National Champion Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team|The Huskies at the White House]]

UConn was awarded a #1 seed (the number one overall seed) and assigned to the Dayton bracket. Their first round game was against [[Southern Jaguars|Southern]], the winner of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]] tournament. Southern would score the first two points, but that would be their only lead of the game. Tina Charles hit her first nine shot attempts, on her way to a 22 point game, and teammate Maya More would add 21. Others would score as well, but those two scored enough to outscore the Jaguars. UConnâs defense would hold the Jaguars to just ten second half points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Southern&quot;/&gt;

The second round game was against [[Temple Owls|Temple]]. The Temple team is coached by Tonya Cardoza, who was an assistant coach at UConn for 14 years, before she accepted the head coaching job at Temple prior to the start of the 2008â2009 season. The game also occurred on Auriemmaâs 56th birthday. UConn outscored Temple 55â12 in the first half, hitting 78% of their field goal attempts.  The starting players ended up playing no more than half the game. Auriemma described the game as âpretty incredible performanceâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Temple&quot;/&gt;

The Sweet Sixteen game was against [[Iowa State Cyclones|Iowa State]]. The two teams last played each other in 1999, when Iowa State knocked number one seeded UConn out of the NCAA tournament. This time, the result would be quite different. Maya Moore outscored Iowa State in the first half, despite sitting more than ten minutes with two fouls. The lead would grow to 50, at which time the starters all sat for the remainder of the game, and the final margin tightened. The final score was 74â36.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iowa State&quot;/&gt;

In the Dayton Regional final, there was a rematch of a game earlier this season against [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]], and it was no contest as the Huskies rolled thanks to Maya Moore's 22 points and Tina Charles added 20 points and had 14 rebounds in a 90â50 rout of the Lady Seminoles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dayton Regional final&quot;/&gt; The win earned them a trip to the Women's Final Four and a date with [[Baylor Bears|Baylor]] and one of the most dominant players in women's basketball, [[Brittney Griner]].

The Final Four semi-final game against Baylor started the way many games this season have started. Despite playing a top-ranked team, Connecticut went out to leads of 11â3 and 25â8.  Baylor didnât quit, and by halftime, the 17 point lead was down to 13. UConn scored the first basket of the second half, but then Baylor scored twelve consecutive points, to cut the margin to three. Baylorâs 6â 8â center Griner had five blocks to go along with 13 points and six rebounds. In contrast, UConnâs center Charles had two blocks along with 21 points and 13 rebounds, while Maya Moore scored 34 points, the fourth highest point total in semifinal history. The final score in favor of Connecticut was 70â50, setting up a rematch with Stanford.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baylor&quot;/&gt;

The National Championship game on Tuesday was against Stanford. Stanford's last loss was to Connecticut in December 2009, and Connecticut's last loss was to Stanford, exactly two years before, in the Final Four of 2008. The game started the way many games for Connecticut have startedâjust over two minutes into the game, Connecticut had a 5â0 lead. However, they would not score for over ten minutes, missing sixteen consecutive shots. Stanford would lead by as many as nine points, and would go to halftime with a 20â12 lead. The twelve points scored by UConn was the lowest first half total in the history of Connecticut basketball.&lt;ref name=&quot;Championship boxscore&quot;/&gt;
{{Rquote|right|the best team in all of sports, any sport, any gender, by far|[[Barack Obama]], May 17, 2010|&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama Quote&quot;/&gt;}}

Maya Moore lead the team after the half, scoring 11 of the team's first 17 points, including the basket that put Connecticut back into the lead, this time for good. Moore would end up with 23 points and 11 rebounds, and earned Most Outstanding Player honors for the Final Four. Connecticut would go on to win 53â47, ending their streak of double-digit victories, but winning their 78th consecutive game, resulting in their seventh National Championship, their second consecutive undefeated season and their fourth overall undefeated season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Championship&quot;/&gt;
