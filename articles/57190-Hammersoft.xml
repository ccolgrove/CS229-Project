The '''Muscogee''' (or '''Muskogee'''), also known as the '''Creek''' or '''Creeks''', are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people traditionally from the [[Southern United States|southeastern United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Transcribed documents&quot;&gt;[http://anpa.ualr.edu/digital_library/Additional%20Texts%20-%20Yuchi%20.htm Transcribed documents] Sequoyah Research Center and the American Native Press Archives&lt;/ref&gt; '''Mvskoke''' is their name in traditional spelling. The modern Muscogee live primarily in [[Oklahoma]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Florida]]. Their language, [[Creek language|Mvskoke]], is a member of the Muscogee branch of the [[Muskogean languages|Muscogean language family]].

They were descendants of the [[Mississippian culture]] peoples, who built [[earthwork (archaeology)|earthwork mounds]] at their regional [[chiefdom]]s located throughout the [[Mississippi River]] valley and its tributaries. The historian Walter Williams and others believe the early [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish explorers]] encountered ancestors of the Muscogee when they visited Mississippian-culture [[chiefdoms]] in the Southeast in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref name=walter_williams_antecedents&gt;

The Muscogee were the first Native Americans to be &quot;civilized&quot; under George Washington's civilization plan. In the 19th century, the Muscogee were known as one of the &quot;[[Five Civilized Tribes]]&quot;, because they had integrated numerous cultural and technological practices of their more recent [[European American]] neighbors. Influenced by their prophetic interpretations of an 1811 [[comet]] and [[earthquake]], the Upper Towns of the Muscogee, supported by the [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]], began to resist European-American encroachment.  Internal divisions with the Lower Towns led to the [[Red Stick War]] (Creek War, 1813-1814); begun as a civil war within the Muscogee Nation, it enmeshed them in the [[War of 1812]] against the United States.

During the [[Indian Removal]] of 1830, most of the Muscogee Nation moved to [[Indian Territory]]. The [[Muscogee Creek Nation]] based in Oklahoma is federally recognized, as are the [[Poarch Band of Creek Indians]] of Alabama, the [[Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana]], and the [[Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas]].

[[Image:Chromesun kincaid site 01.jpg|right|295px|thumb|The Mississippian culture was a mound-building Native American culture that flourished in the United States before the arrival of Europeans.]]

&lt;/ref&gt; Paleo-Indians in the Southeast were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who pursued a wide range of animals, including the [[megafauna]], which became extinct following the end of the [[Pleistocene]] age.&lt;ref name=guy_prentice /&gt; The [[Woodland period]] from 1000 BCE to 1000 CE was marked by the development of pottery and the small-scale horticulture of the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]].

The [[Mississippian culture]] arose as the cultivation of [[Mesoamerican]] crops of corn and beans led to population growth.  Increased population density gave rise of urban centers and regional [[chiefdoms]], of which the greatest was the settlement known as [[Cahokia]], in present-day [[Illinois]].  Stratified societies developed, with [[hereditary]] religious and political elites, and flourished in what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States from 800 to 1500 C.E.

The early historic Muscogee were probably descendants of the [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]]s of the [[Mississippian culture]] along the [[Tennessee River]] in modern [[Tennessee]],&lt;ref name=Finger_2001&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The region is best described as a collection of moderately sized native [[chiefdom]]s (such as the [[Coosa chiefdom]] on the [[Coosa River]]), interspersed with completely autonomous villages and tribal groups. The late [[Mississippian culture]] is what the earliest Spanish explorers encountered, beginning on April 2, 1513, with [[Juan Ponce de LeÃ³n]]'s [[Florida]] landing and the 1526 [[Lucas VÃ¡zquez de AyllÃ³n]] expedition in [[South Carolina]].

===Spanish expedition (1540â1543)===

After [[Ãlvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca|Cabeza de Vaca]], a castaway who survived the ill-fated [[NarvÃ¡ez expedition]] returned to Spain, he described to the Court of [[Hernando de Soto]] that the New World was the &quot;richest country in the world.&quot; Hernando de Soto was a Spanish [[explorer]] and [[conquistador]] who led the first expedition into the interior of the North American continent. De Soto, convinced of the &quot;riches&quot;, wanted Cabeza de Vaca to go on the expedition, but de Vaca declined his offer because of a payment dispute.&lt;ref name=smith_desoto&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; From 1540â1543, de Soto explored through present-day Florida and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and then down into the [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] area.  The areas were later inhabited by the historic Muscogee [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].

De Soto had the best-equipped army at the time. As his military successes were well known in Spain, he attracted many recruits from a variety of backgrounds who joined his quest for riches in the New World. As the de Soto expedition's brutalities became known to the indigenous peoples, they decided to defend their territory.  The [[Chief Tuskaloosa#Battle of Mabila|Battle of Mabila]] was a turning point for the de Soto venture; the battle &quot;broke the back&quot; of the Spanish campaign, and the expedition never fully recovered.

===Rise of the Muscogee Confederacy===
De Soto's expedition, especially the new infectious diseases carried by the Europeans, caused a high rate of fatalities among the [[indigenous peoples]].  Historians believe that disease epidemics contributed to the depopulation and collapse of the [[Mississippian culture]]. As the survivors and descendants regrouped, the Muscogee or [[Creek Confederacy]] arose, which was a loose alliance of Muskogee-speaking peoples.

The Muscogee lived in autonomous villages in river valleys throughout present-day [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Alabama]], speaking several related [[Muskogean languages]]. [[Hitchiti]] was the most widely spoken in present-day Georgia; Hitchiti speakers were the first to be displaced by white settlers, and the language died out.

[[Creek language|Muskogee]] was spoken from the [[Chattahoochee]] to the [[Alabama River|Alabama]].  [[Koasati]] (Coushatta) and [[Alabama (people)|Alibamu]] were spoken in the upper [[Alabama River|Alabama]] basin and parts of the [[Tennessee River]]. The Muscogee were a confederacy of tribes consisting of [[Yuchi]], [[Koasati]], Alabama, [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], [[Tuskeegee]], [[Coweta]], [[Cusseta, Creek Nation|Cusseta]], [[Chehaw]] (Chiaha), Hitchiti, [[Tuckabatchee]], [[Oakfuskee]], and many others.&lt;ref name=confederacy_of_tribes&gt;

The basin social unit was the town (''idalwa''). [[Abihka]], [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], [[Cusseta, Creek Nation|Cusseta]] (Kasihta) and [[Coweta County, Georgia|Coweta]] are the four 'mother towns' of the Muscogee Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;Isham, Theodore and Blue Clark, &quot;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/C/CR006.html Creek (Mvskoke)],&quot; [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/ Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture]'' (accessed May 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the Cusseta and Coweta bands are considered the earliest members of the Muscogee Nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transcribed documents&quot;/&gt; The Lower Towns, along the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]], [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint]], and [[Apalachicola River|Apalachicola]] rivers, and further east along the [[Ocmulgee River|Ocmulgee]] and [[Oconee River|Oconee]] rivers, were Coweta, Cusseta (Kasihta, [[Cofitachequi|Cofitachiqui]]), Upper Chehaw ([[Chiaha]]), [[Hitchiti]], Oconee, Ocmulgee, Okawaigi, [[Apalachee]], [[Yamasee]] (Altamaha), Ocfuskee, Sawokli, and Tamali.

The Upper Towns, located on the [[Coosa River|Coosa]], [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and [[Alabama River|Alabama]] rivers, were [[Tuckabatchee]], [[Abhika]], [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]] (Kusa; the dominant people of [[East Tennessee]] and [[North Georgia]] during the Spanish explorations), Itawa (original inhabitants of the [[Etowah Indian Mounds]]), Hothliwahi (Ullibahali), Hilibi, [[Eufaula tribe|Eufaula]], Wakokai, Atasi, [[Alibamu]], [[Coushatta]] (Koasati; they had absorbed the Kaski/Casqui and the [[Toqua (Tennessee)|Tali]]), and Tuskegee (&quot;Napochi&quot; in the de Luna chronicles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/creek/creektowns.htm Creek Towns] (accessed May 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important leader in Muscogee society was the ''mico'' or village chief. ''Micos'' led warriors in battle and represented their villages, but held authority only insofar as they could persuade others to agree with their decisions.  ''Micos'' ruled with the assistance of ''micalgi'' or lesser chiefs, and various advisors, including a second in charge called the ''heniha'', respected village elders, medicine men, and a ''tustunnuggee'' or ranking warrior, the principal military advisor.  The ''yahola'' or [[medicine man]] officiated at various rituals, especially administering the [[black drink]] imbibed in purification ceremonies.

The most important social unit was the clan. Clans organized hunts, distributed lands, arranged marriages, and punished lawbreakers.  The authority of the ''micos'' was greatly limited by the clan leaders or mothers, mostly elderly women, because clan membership was matrilineal. The Wind Clan was considered the first of the clans.  The majority of ''micos'' belonged to this clan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2550 Creek Indian Leaders],&quot; ''[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/ New Georgia Encyclopedia]'' (accessed May 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===British, French and Spanish Expansion===
{{See|Yamasee War}}
[[File:OcmulgeeRaid.JPG|thumbnail|left|A raiding party against Spanish missions in Florida passes the Ocmulgee trading-post.]]

Britain, France and Spain all established colonies in the present-day [[Southeastern U.S.]] Spain used missions to control the natives, the British and the French opted for trade over conversion. In the 17th century, [[Franciscan]] friars in [[Spanish Florida]] built [[Spanish missions in Florida|missions]] along [[Apalachee Bay]]. In 1670 English settlers from [[Barbados]] founded [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town]], capital of the new [[Carolina Colony|Province of Carolina]]; traders from Carolina exchanged [[flintlocks]], gunpowder, axes, glass beads, cloth and West Indian rum for [[white-tailed deer]] pelts for the English leather industry and Indian slaves for Caribbean plantations. The Spanish and their 'mission Indians' burned most of the towns along the Chattahoochee after they welcomed Scottish explorer [[Henry Woodward (colonist)|Henry Woodward]] in 1685. In 1690, the English built a trading post on the [[Ocmulgee River]], known as Ochese-hatchee (creek), where a dozen towns relocated to escape the Spanish and acquire English trade-goods. The name &quot;Creek&quot; most likely derived from [[Ocheese Creek]] and broadly applies to all of the Muscogee Confederacy, including the [[Yuchi]] and [[Natchez people|Natchez]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker 390&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1704â06, Carolina Governor Col. [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]] led colonial militia and Ochese Creek and Yamasee warriors in raids that destroyed the [[Spanish missions in Florida|Spanish missions of the Florida interior]]; they captured some 10,000 unarmed 'mission Indians,' the [[Timucua]] and [[Apalachee]], and sold them into slavery. With Florida depopulated, English traders paid other tribes to attack and enslave the Yamasee, leading to the [[Yamassee War]] of 1715â17.

[[Image:ChiefTomochichiAndNephew.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yamacraw leader Tomochichi and nephew in 1733.]]

The Ochese Creeks joined the Yamasee, burning trade-posts and raiding back-country settlers, but the revolt ran low on gunpowder and was put down by Carolinian militia and their [[Cherokee]] allies. The Yamasee took refuge in [[Spanish Florida]], the Ochese Creeks fled west to the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]]. [[French Canadian]] explorers founded [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] as the first capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] in 1702, and took advantage of the war to build [[Fort Toulouse]] at the confluence of the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and [[Coosa River|Coosa]] in 1717, trading with the [[Alabama (people)|Alabama]] and [[Coushatta]]. Fearing they would come under French influence, the British reopened the deerskin trade with the Lower Creeks, antagonizing the Yamasee, now allies of Spain.  The French instigated the Upper Creeks to raid the Lower Creeks. In May 1718, the shrewd 'Emperor' Brim, ''mico'' of the powerful [[Coweta County|Coweta]] band, invited representatives of Britain, France, and Spain to his village and, in council with Upper and Lower Creek leaders, declared a policy of Muscogee neutrality in their colonial rivalry. That year, the Spaniards built the presidio of [[San Marcos de Apalache]] on [[Apalachee Bay]].  In 1721 the British built [[Fort King George]] at the mouth of the [[Altamaha River]]. As the three European imperial powers established themselves along the borders of Muscogee lands, the latter's strategy of neutrality allowed them to hold the balance of power.

The colony of [[History of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] was created in 1732; its first settlement, [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], was founded the following year, on a river bluff where the Yamacraw, a Yamasee band that remained allies of England, allowed John Musgrove to establish a fur-trading post. His wife [[Mary Musgrove]] was the daughter of an English trader and a Muscogee woman from the powerful Wind Clan, half-sister of 'Emperor' Brim. She was the principal interpreter for Georgia's founder and first Governor Gen. [[James Oglethorpe]], using her connections to foster peace between the Creek Indians and the new colony.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3543&amp;hl=y Mary Musgrove],&quot; [http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/ Georgia Encyclopedia Online] (accessed May 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The deerskin trade grew, and by the 1750s, [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] exported up to 50,000 deerskins a year.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-579 Creek Indians],&quot; ''[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/ New Georgia Encyclopedia]'' (accessed May 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1736, Spanish and British officials established a neutral zone from the [[Altamaha River|Altamaha]] to the [[St. Johns River]] in present-day Florida, guaranteeing Native hunting grounds for the deerskin trade and protecting [[Spanish Florida]] from further British encroachment. Ca.1750 a group of [[Hitchiti|Ochese]] moved to the neutral zone, after clashing with the [[Creek language|Muskogee]]-speaking towns of the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]], where they had fled after the [[Yamasee War]].

Led by Chief Secoffee ([[Cowkeeper]]), they became the center of a new tribal confederacy, the [[Seminole]], which grew to include earlier refugees from the [[Yamasee War]], remnants of the 'mission Indians,' and escaped African slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Forbs, Gerald, &quot;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v015/v015p102.html#fn30 The Origin of the Seminole Indians],&quot; p. 108, ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'', Vol. 15, No. 1, March 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Their name comes from the Spanish word ''cimarrones'', which originally referred to a domestic animal that had reverted to the wild. ''Cimarrones'' was used by the Spanish and Portuguese to refer to fugitive slavesâ&quot;[[maroon]]&quot; emerges linguistically from this root as wellâand American Indians who fled European invaders. In the [[Hitchiti]] language, which lacked an 'r' sound, it became ''simanoli'', and eventually Seminole.

===American Revolutionary War===
With the end of the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years War]]) in 1763, France lost its North American empire, and British-American settlers moved inland. Indian discontent led to raids against back-country settlers, and the perception that the royal government favored the Indians and the deerskin trade led many back-country white settlers to join the [[Sons of Liberty]]. Fears of land-hungry settlers and need for European manufactured goods led the Muscogee to side with the British, but like many tribes, they were divided by factionalism, and, in general, avoided sustained fighting, preferring to protect their sovereignty through cautious participation.

During the [[American Revolution]], the Upper Creeks sided with the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]], fighting alongside the [[Chickamauga Indian|Chickamauga]] (Lower Cherokee) warriors of [[Dragging Canoe]], in the [[Chickamauga Wars (1776â1794)|Chickamauga Wars]], against white settlers in present-day [[Tennessee]]. This alliance was orchestrated by the [[Coushatta]] chief [[Alexander McGillivray]], son of [[Lachlan McGillivray]], a wealthy Scottish [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] fur-trader and planter, whose properties were confiscated by Georgia. His ex-partner, [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] [[George Galphin]], initially persuaded the Lower Creeks to remain neutral, but [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] Capt. William McIntosh led a group of pro-British [[Hitchiti]], and most of the Lower Creeks nominally allied with Britain after the 1779 [[Capture of Savannah]]. Muscogee warriors fought on behalf of Britain [[Spain in the American Revolution|during the Mobile and Pensacola campaigns of 1780â81]], where Spain re-conquered [[British West Florida]]. Loyalist leader [[Thomas Brown (loyalist)|Thomas Brown]] raised a division of [[King's Rangers]] to contest [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] control over the Georgia and Carolina interior and instigated Cherokee raids against the [[North Carolina]] back-country after the [[Battle of King's Mountain]]. He seized [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] in March 1780, with the aid of an Upper Creek war-party, but reinforcements from the Lower Creeks and local white [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s never came, and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] militia led by [[Elijah Clarke]] retook Augusta in 1781.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Cashin ''The King's Ranger: Thomas Brown and the American Revolution on the Southern Frontier'' Pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The next year an Upper Creek war-party trying to relieve the British garrison at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] was routed by [[Continental Army]] troops under Gen. [[Anthony Wayne|'Mad' Anthony Wayne]].

After the war ended in 1783, the Muscogee learned that Britain had ceded their lands to the now independent [[United States]]. That year, two Lower Creek chiefs, Hopoithle Miko (Tame King) and Eneah Miko (Fat King), ceded {{convert|800|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of land to the state of Georgia. [[Alexander McGillivray]] led  pan-Indian resistance to white encroachment, receiving arms from the [[Spanish Florida|Spanish in Florida]] to fight trespassers. The bilingual and bicultural McGillivray worked to create a sense of Muscogee nationalism and centralize political authority, struggling against village leaders who individually sold land to the United States. He also became a wealthy landowner and merchant, owning as many as sixty black slaves.

In 1784, he negotiated the Treaty of Pensacola with Spain, recognizing Muscogee control over {{convert|3000000|acre|km2|sigfig=2}} of land claimed by Georgia, and guaranteeing access to the British firm [[Panton, Leslie &amp; Company|Panton, Leslie &amp; Co.]] which controlled the deerskin trade, while making himself an official representative of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2313&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1786, a council in [[Tuckabatchee]] decided to wage war against white settlers on Muscogee lands. War parties attacked settlers along the [[Oconee River]], and Georgia mobilized its militia. McGillivray refused to negotiate with the state that had confiscated his father's plantations, but President [[George Washington]] sent a special emissary, Col. [[Marinus Willet]], who persuaded him to travel to [[New York City]], then the capital of the U.S., and deal directly with the federal government. In the summer of 1790, McGillivray and 29 other Muscogee chiefs signed the [[Treaty of New York]], on behalf of the 'Upper, Middle and Lower Creek and Seminole composing the Creek nation of Indians,' ceding a large portion of their lands to the federal government and promising to return fugitive slaves, in return for federal recognition of Muscogee sovereignty and promises to evict white settlers. McGillivray died in 1793, and with the invention of the [[cotton gin]] white settlers on the Southwestern frontier who hoped to become cotton-planters clamored for Indian lands. In 1795, [[Elijah Clarke]] and several hundred followers defied the [[Treaty of New York]] and established the short-lived [[Trans-Oconee Republic]].

===Muscogee and Choctaw land dispute (1790)===
In 1790, the Muscogee and [[Choctaw]] were in conflict over land near the [[Noxubee River]]. The two nations agreed to settle the dispute by ball-play. With nearly 10,000 players and bystanders, the two nations prepared for nearly three months. After a long daylong struggle, the Muscogee won the game. A fight broke out and the two nations fought until sun down with nearly 500 dead and much more wounded.

===State of Muskogee and William Bowles===
{{See|State of Muskogee}}

[[Image:William Bowles.jpg|200px|thumb|left|William Augustus Bowles (1763â1805) was also known as Estajoca, his Muscogee name.]]

[[William Augustus Bowles]] was born into a wealthy [[Maryland]] [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] family, enlisting with the [[Maryland Loyalists Battalion]] at age 14 and becoming an ensign in [[Royal Navy]] by age 15. Cashiered for dereliction of duty after returning too late to his ship at [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], Bowles escaped north and found refuge among the Lower Creek towns of the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] basin. He married two wives, one [[Cherokee]] and the other Hitchiti Muscogee, and became heir to a Muscogee chiefdom. In 1781, a 17-year old Bowles led Muscogee forces at the [[Battle of Pensacola (1781)|Battle of Pensacola]]. After seeking refuge in the [[Bahamas]], he travelled to London.  He was received by King [[George III]] as 'Chief of the Embassy for Creek and Cherokee Nations'; it was with British backing that he returned to train the Muscogee as pirates to attack Spanish ships.

In 1799, Bowles formed the [[State of Muskogee]], with the support of the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] Creeks and the [[Seminoles]]. He established his capital at Miccosuki, a village on the shores of [[Lake Miccosukee]] near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].  It was ruled by ''Mico'' Kanache, his father-in-law and strongest ally. Bowles envisioned the [[State of Muskogee]], with its capital at Miccosuki, encompassing large portions of present-day Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, and incorporating the [[Cherokee]], Upper and Lower Creeks, [[Chickasaw]] and [[Choctaw]]. Bowles' first act was declaring the 1796  [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso]] which drew the boundary between the U.S. and [[West Florida]] null-and-void, because the Indians were not consulted.

He denounced the treaties [[Alexander McGillivray]] had negotiated with Spain and the U.S., threatening to declare war on the United States unless it returned Muscogee lands, and issuing a death sentence against [[George Washington]]'s [[Indian agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]], who won the loyalty of the Lower Creeks. He built a tiny navy, and raided Spanish ships in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and, in 1800, declared war on Spain, briefly capturing the presidio and trading post of [[San Marcos de Apalache]] before being forced to retreat. Although a Spanish force that set out to destroy Mikosuki got lost in the swamps, a second attempt to take San Marcos ended in disaster.  After a European armistice led to the loss of British support, Bowles was discredited.  The Seminole signed a peace treaty with Spain. The following year, he was betrayed by Lower Creek supporters of Hawkins at a tribal council.  They turned Bowles over to the Spanish, and he died in prison in [[Havana, Cuba]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernhistory.us/wabowles.htm Chris Kimball, &quot;W.A.

&lt;/ref&gt; The Muscogee would be the first Native Americans to be &quot;civilized&quot; under Washington's six-point plan. The Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole would follow the Muscogee efforts to implement Washington's new policy of civilization.

In 1796, Washington appointed [[Benjamin Hawkins]] as General Superintendent of Indian Affairs dealing with all tribes south of the [[Ohio River]]. He personally assumed the role of principal agent to the Muscogee. He moved to the area that is now [[Crawford County, Georgia|Crawford County]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He began to teach agricultural practices to the tribe, starting a farm at his home on the Flint River. In time, he brought in [[slaves]] and workers, cleared several hundred acres, and established mills and a trading post as well as his farm.

For years, Hawkins met with chiefs on his porch and discuss matters. He was responsible for the longest period of peace between the settlers and the tribe, overseeing 19 years of peace. In 1805, the Lower Creeks ceded their lands east of the [[Ocmulgee River|Ocmulgee]] to Georgia, with the exception of the sacred burial mounds of the [[Ocmulgee National Monument|Ocmulgee Old Fields]].  They allowed a [[Federal Road (Creek lands)|Federal Road]] linking [[New Orleans]] to [[Washington, D.C.]] to be built through their territory. A number of Muscogee chiefs acquired slaves and created cotton plantations, grist mills and businesses along the Federal Road. In 1806, [[Fort Benjamin Hawkins]] was built on a hill overlooking the [[Ocmulgee National Monument|Ocmulgee Old Fields]], to protect expanding settlements and serve as a reminder of U.S. rule.

Hawkins was disheartened and shocked by the outbreak of the [[Creek War]], which destroyed his life work of improving the Muscogee quality of life. Hawkins saw much of his work toward building a peace destroyed in 1812. A faction of Muscogee joined the Pan-American Indian movement of [[Tenskwatawa]] and [[Tecumseh]], rejecting accommodation with white settlers and adaptation of European-American culture. Although Hawkins personally was never attacked, he was forced to watch an internal civil war among the Muscogee develop into a war with the United States.

{{cquote|''The Muscogee was once a mighty people. The Georgians trembled at your war-whoop, and the maidens of my tribe, on the distant lakes, sung the prowess of your warriors and sighed for their embraces. Now your very blood is white; your tomahawks have no edge; your bows and arrows were buried with your fathers. Oh! Muscogees, brethren of my mother, brush from your eyelids the sleep of slavery; once more strike for vengeance; once more for your country. The spirits of the mighty dead complain. Their tears drop from the weeping skies. Let the white race perish. They seize your land; they corrupt your women; they trample on the ashes of your dead! Back, whence they came, upon a trail of blood, they must be driven. Back! back, ay, into the great water whose accursed waves brought them to our shores! Burn their dwellings! Destroy their stock! Slay their wives and children! The Red Man owns the country, and the Pale-faces must never enjoy it. War now! War forever! ... Tecumseh will soon return to his country. My prophets shall tarry with you. They will stand between you and the bullets of your enemies. When the white men approach you the yawning earth shall swallow them up. Soon shall you see my arm of fire stretched athwart the sky.

===A comet, earthquakes, and Tecumseh (1811)===
{{See|Great Comet of 1811}}
{{See|1812 New Madrid earthquake}}

[[Image:Comet of 1811.jpg|150px|left|thumb|The Great Comet of 1811, as drawn by [[William Henry Smyth]]]]

A comet appeared in March 1811. The [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]], whose name meant &quot;shooting star,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sugden, John. [http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/sugden-tecumseh.html &quot;The Shooting Star.'] ''New York Times: Books.'' 1997 (retrieved 5 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
traveled to [[Tuckabatchee]], where he told the Muscogee that the comet signaled his coming. McKenney reported that the Tecumseh would prove that the [[Great Spirit]] had sent him by giving the Muscogee a sign. Shortly after Tecumseh left the Southeast, the sign arrived as promised in the form of an [[earthquake]].

On December 11, 1811, the [[New Madrid Earthquake]] shook the Muscogee lands and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].  While the interpretation of this event varied from tribe to tribe, one consensus was universally accepted: the powerful earthquake had to have meant something. &lt;!--(Ehle p. 102-104)--&gt; The earthquake and its aftershocks helped the Tecumseh resistance movement by convincing, not only the Muscogee, but other Native American tribes as well, that the Shawnee must be supported.

[[Image:New Madrid Erdbeben.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The New Madrid Earthquake was interpreted by the Muscogee to support the Shawnees' resistance.]]

{{cquote|''The Indians were filled with great terror ... the trees and wigwams shook exceedingly; the ice which skirted the margin of the Arkansas river was broken into pieces; and the most of the Indians thought that the Great Spirit, angry with the human race, was about to destroy the world.''|20px|20px|- Roger L. Nichols, ''The American Indian''}}

The Muscogee who joined Tecumseh's confederation were known as the Red Sticks. Stories of the origin of the Red Stick name varies, but one is that they were named for the Muscogee tradition of carrying a bundle of sticks that mark the days until an event occurs. Sticks painted red symbol war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/creeks.html &quot;The Creeks.&quot;] ''War of 1812&quot; People and Stories.'' (retrieved 5 December 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Stick rebellion===
{{See|Creek War}}
{{See|Fort Mims massacre}}

[[Image:Menawa high resolution.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Menawa]] was one of the principal leaders of the Red Sticks.  After the war, he continued to oppose white encroachment on Muscogee lands, visiting Washington, D.C. in 1826 to protest the [[Treaty of Indian Springs]]. Painted by [[Charles Bird King]], 1837.]]

The Creek War of 1813â1814, also known as the ''Red Stick War'', began as a [[civil war]] within the Muscogee Nation, only to become enmeshed within the [[War of 1812]]. Inspired by the fiery eloquence of the [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]] and their own religious leaders, and encouraged by British traders, Red Stick leaders such as [[William Weatherford]] (Red Eagle), [[Peter McQueen]], and [[Menawa]] won the support of the Upper Creek towns. Allied with the British, they opposed white encroachment on Muscogee lands and the 'civilizing programs' administered by [[Benjamin Hawkins]], and clashed with many of the leading chiefs of the Muscogee Nation, most notably the Lower Creek ''Mico'' [[William McIntosh]], Hawkins' most powerful ally. Their opponents, who sought peaceful relations with white settlers, were known as the White Sticks. Before the Muscogee Civil War began, the Red Sticks attempted to keep their activities secret from the old chiefs. They were emboldened when [[Tecumseh]] rallied his followers and joined with a British invasion to [[Siege of Detroit|capture Fort Detroit]] in August 1812.

In February 1813, a small party of Red Sticks, led by Little Warrior, was returning from [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] when they killed two families of settlers along the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], near [[Nashville]]. Hawkins demanded that the Muscogees turn over Little Warrior and his six companions. Instead of handing the marauders over to the federal agents, Big Warrior and the old chiefs decided to execute the war party. This decision was the spark which ignited the civil war among the Muscogee.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, 777â778&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first clashes between Red Sticks and the American whites took place on July 21, 1813, when a group of American soldiers from [[Fort Mims]] (north of [[Mobile, Alabama]]) stopped a party of Red Sticks who were returning from [[West Florida]], where they had bought munitions from the Spanish governor at [[Pensacola]]. The Red Sticks fled the scene, and the U.S. soldiers looted what they found, allowing the Red Sticks to regroup and retaliate with a surprise attack that forced the Americans to retreat. The [[Battle of Burnt Corn]], as the exchange became known, broadened the Creek Civil War to include American forces.

On August 30, 1813, Red Sticks led by Red Eagle [[William Weatherford]] attacked [[Fort Mims]], where white settlers and their Indian allies had gathered. The Red Sticks captured the fort by surprise, and carried out a [[List of events named massacres|massacre]], killing men, women and children.  They spared only the black [[slaves]] whom they took as captured booty.  After the Indians killed nearly 250-500 at the fort, settlers across the American southwestern frontier were in a panic.

{{cquote|''On the morning of August 30, 1813, few of Fort Mimsâ defenders stirred in the steaming heat. In the forested shade, the Creeks watched and waited. The fortâs main gate, located on the east side of the stockade, had not been closed by the garrison troops ... No sentries occupied the blockhouse. ''|20px|20px|A Short History of the Ft.

The Red Stick victory spread panic throughout the Southeastern United States, and the cry &quot;Remember Fort Mims!&quot; was popular among the public wanting revenge. With Federal troops tied up on the northern front against the British in Canada, the [[Tennessee]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[Mississippi Territory]] militias were commissioned and invaded the Upper Creek towns.  They were joined by Indian allies, the Lower Creek under [[William McIntosh]] and the Cherokee under [[Major Ridge]]. Outnumbered and poorly armed, being too far removed from [[Canada]] to receive British aid, the Red Sticks put up a desperate fight. On March 27, 1814, General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s Tennessee [[militia]], aided by the 39th U. S. [[Infantry]] Regiment and [[Cherokee]] and Lower Creek warriors, crushed the Red Sticks at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] on the [[Tallapoosa River]]. Though the Red Sticks had been soundly defeated and about 3,000 Upper Muscogee died in the war, the remnants held out several months longer.

===Muscogee diaspora (1814)===
[[Image:Jackson and Weatherford.jpg|275px|right|thumb|Depiction of Red Eagle's surrendering to Andrew Jackson after the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Jackson was so impressed with Weatherford's boldness that he let him go.]]

In August 1814, the Red Sticks surrendered to Jackson at ''[[Wetumpka, Alabama|Wetumpka]]'' (near the present city of [[Montgomery, Alabama]]). On August 9, 1814, the Muscogee nation was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]].  It ended the war and required the tribe to cede some 20 million acres (81,000&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of landâ more than half of their ancestral territorial holdingsâ to the United States. Even those who had fought alongside Jackson were compelled to cede land, since Jackson held them responsible for allowing the Red Sticks to revolt. The state of Alabama was created largely from the Red Sticks' domain and was admitted to the United States in 1819.

Many Muscogee refused to surrender and escaped to Florida.  They allied with other remnant tribes, becoming the [[Seminole]]). Muscogee were later involved on both sides of the [[Seminole War]]s in Florida.

===Seminole War===
The Red Stick refugees who arrived in Florida after the [[Creek War]] tripled the Seminole population, and strengthened the tribe's Muscogee characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Merwyn Garbarino, ''The Seminole'' Pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In 1814, British forces landed in [[West Florida]] and began arming the Seminole. The British had built a fort on the [[Apalachicola River|Apalachicola]] at Prospect Bluff, and after the end of the [[War of 1812]], offered it to the Seminole.  They were returning to their villages, so the British offered the fort to fugitive slaves.  It became called '[[Fort Gadsden|Negro Fort]]' by Southern planters, who felt its existence inspired escape or rebellion by their slaves, and complained to the US government. After notifying the Spanish governor, who said he had insufficient forces to take the force, the US sent in soldiers in 1816 on a pretext, and destroyed the fort.  It blew up as a result of heated cannon shot from a gunboat hitting the powder magazine.  All its inhabitants died. 

The Seminole continued to welcome fugitive black slaves and raid American settlers, leading the U.S. to declare war in 1817. The following year, General [[Andrew Jackson]] invaded Florida with an army that included more than 1,000 Lower Creek warriors; they destroyed Seminole towns and captured [[Pensacola]]. Jackson's victory forced Spain to sign the [[AdamsâOnÃ­s Treaty]] in 1819, ceding Florida to the U.S. In 1823, a delegation of Seminole chiefs met with the new U.S. governor of Florida, expressing their opposition to proposals that would reunite them with the Upper and Lower Creek, partly because the latter tribes intended to enslave the [[Black Seminole]]. Instead, the Seminole agreed to move onto a reservation in inland central Florida.

===Treaties of Indian Springs===
[[Image:William McIntosh by Charles Bird King.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Charles Bird King]]'s portrait of [[William McIntosh]].]]

''Mico'' [[William McIntosh]] led the Lower Creek warriors who fought alongside the U.S. in the [[Creek War]] and the [[Seminole War|First Seminole War]]. The son of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] officer of the same name who had recruited a band of [[Hitchiti]] to the British cause, McIntosh never knew his white father.  He had family ties to some of Georgia's planter elite, and after the wars became a wealthy cotton-planter. Through his mother, he was born into the prominent Wind Clan of the Creek; as the Creek had a [[matrilineal]] system of descent and inheritance, he achieved his chieftainship because of her. He was also related to [[Alexander McGillivray]] and [[William Weatherford]], both mixed-race Creek. 

In the late 1810s and early 1820s, McIntosh helped create a centralized police force called 'Law Menders,' establish written laws, and form a National Creek Council.  Later in the decade, he came to view relocation as inevitable. In 1821, McIntosh and several other chiefs signed away Lower Creek lands east of the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] at the first [[Treaty of Indian Springs]].  As a reward, McIntosh was granted {{convert|1000|acre|km2|sigfig=1}} at the treaty site, where he built a hotel to attract tourists to local hot springs. 

The Creek National Council responded by prescribing the death penalty for tribesmen who surrendered additional land.  Georgian settlers continued to pour into Indian lands, particularly after the discovery of gold in northern Georgia. in 1825 McIntosh and his first cousin, Georgia Governor [[George Troup]], a leading advocate of [[Indian removal]], signed the second [[Treaty of Indian Springs]] at his hotel. Signed by six other Lower Creek chiefs, the treaty ceded the last Lower Creek lands to Georgia, and allocated substantial sums to relocate the Muscogee to the [[Arkansas River]].  It provided for an equally large payment directly to McIntosh.

In April, the old [[Red Stick]] [[Menawa]] led about 200 Law Menders to assassinate McIntosh according to their law.  They burned his upper [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] plantation. A delegation of the Creek National Council, led by the speaker ''[[Opthleyahola]]'', traveled to [[Washington D.C.]] to protest the 1825 treaty.  They convinced President [[John Quincy Adams]] that the treaty was invalid, and negotiated  the more favorable [[Treaty of Washington (1826)]].  The tribe ceded their lands to Georgia in return for $200,000, although they were not required to move west. Troup ignored the new treaty and ordered the eviction of the Muscogee from their remaining lands in Georgia without compensation, mobilizing state militia when Adams threatened federal intervention.

===Removal (1834)===
In the aftermath of the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] and the [[Treaty of Washington (1826)]], the Muscogee were confined to a small strip of land in present-day east central [[Alabama]].

Andrew Jackson was elected president of the United States in 1829, and with his inauguration the government stance toward Indians turned harsher.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson1829-5&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson abandoned the policy of his predecessors of treating different Indian groups as separate nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson1829-5&quot;/&gt; Instead, he aggressively pursued plans to move all Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River to Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson1829-5&quot;/&gt;

''|20px|20px|President Andrew Jackson addressing the Creeks , 1829&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson1829-5&quot;/&gt;}}

At Jackson's request, the United States Congress opened a fierce debate on an Indian Removal Bill.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson1829-5&quot;/&gt; In the end, the bill passed, but the vote was close. The Senate passed the measure 28 to 19, while in the House it squeaked by, 102 to 97. Jackson signed the legislation into law June 30, 1830.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson1829-5&quot;/&gt;

Following the [[Indian Removal Act]], in 1832 the Creek National Council signed the [[Treaty of Cusseta]], ceding their remaining lands east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] to the U.S., and accepting relocation to the [[Indian Territory]]. Most Muscogee were removed to Indian Territory during the [[Trail of Tears]] in 1834, although some remained behind. 

Some Muscogee in Alabama live near the federally recognized [[Poarch Creek Reservation]] in [[Atmore, Alabama|Atmore]] (northeast of [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]), and Muscogee live in essentially undocumented ethnic towns in Florida.  The Alabama reservation includes a [[Indian gaming|casino]] and 16-story hotel.  The Creek tribe holds an annual [[powwow]] on [[Thanksgiving]]. Additionally, Muscogee descendants of varying degrees of acculturation live throughout the southeastern United States.

{{cquote|''By 1836, when extensive Creek removal was underway, Eneah Emathala emerged as leader of the Lower Creeks ... their desire was only to be left alone in their homeland ... Gen.

===American Civil War (1861)===
{{See also|Indian Territory in the American Civil War}}
[[Image:Creeks in Oklahoma.png|thumb|245px|left|Members of the Creek Nation in Oklahoma around 1877. They included men of mixed Creek, European and African ancestry.]]
At the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], ''[[Opothleyahola]]'' refused to form an alliance with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], unlike many other tribes, including many of the Lower Creeks.  Runaway slaves, free blacks, [[Chickasaw]] and [[Seminole Indians]] began gathering at Opothleyahola's plantation, where they hoped to remain neutral in the conflict between the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]]. On August 15, 1861, Opothleyahola and tribal chief ''Micco Hutko'' contacted President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to request help for the Union loyalists.  On September 10, they received a positive response, stating the United States government would assist them.  The letter directed Opothleyahola to move his people to [[Fort Row]] in [[Wilson County, Kansas]], where they would receive [[right of asylum|asylum]] and aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skyways.lib.ks.us/kansas/genweb/woodson/Yahola.txt Woodson County history]&lt;/ref&gt; They became known as Loyalists, and many were members of the traditional Snake band in the latter part of the century.

Because the majority of the Creek did support the Confederacy during the Civil War, the US government required a new treaty with the nation in 1866 to define peace after the war.  It required the Creek to [[emancipate]] their [[slaves]] and to admit them as full members and citizens of the Creek Nation, equal to the Creek in receiving annuities and land benefits. They were then known as Creek Freedmen.  The US government required setting aside part of the Creek reservation land to be assigned to the freedmen. Many of the tribe resisted these changes. The loss of lands contributed to problems for the nation in the late 19th century.

The Loyalists among the Creek tended to be [[traditionalists]].  They formed the core of a band that became known as the Snakes, which also included many Creek Freedmen.  At the end of the century, they resisted the extinguishing of tribal government and break-up of communal tribal lands enacted by the US Congress with the [[Dawes Commission]] of 1892. These efforts were part of the US government's attempt to impose assimilation on the tribes, to introduce household ownership of land, and to remove legal barriers to the Indian Territory's achieving statehood. Members of the Creek Nation were registered as individuals on the [[Dawes Rolls]]; the Commission separately registered intermarried whites and Creek Freedmen, whether or not they had any Creek ancestry.  This ruined their claims to Creek membership later, even for people who had parents or other relative who were Creek.  The Dawes Rolls have been used as the basis for many tribes to establish membership descent. European-American settlers had moved into the area and pressed for statehood and access to some of the tribal lands for settlement.

==Culture==
[[Image:Selocta.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Selocta (or Shelocta) was a Muscogee chief.]]

Muscogee culture has greatly evolved over the centuries, combining mostly [[European-American]] influences; however, interaction with [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[England]] greatly shaped it as well. They were known for their rapid incorporation of modernity, developing a written language, transitioning to [[yeoman]] farming methods, and accepting [[European-American]]s and [[African-American]]s into their society. Muscogee people continue to preserve ''chaya'' and share a vibrant tribal identity through events such as annual festivals, stick ball games, and language classes. The [[Stomp Dance]] and [[Green Corn Ceremony]] are revered gatherings and rituals.

===Clans===
While families include people who are directly related to each other, clans are composed of all people who are descendants of the same ancestral clan grouping.  Like many Native American nations, the Muscogee Creek are [[matrilineal]]; each person belongs to the clan of his or her mother, who belongs to the clan of her mother.  Fathers are important within the family system.
But, within the clan, it is the motherâs brother (the motherâs nearest blood relation) who functions as the primary teacher, protector, disciplinarian and role model for children, especially for boys. Clan members do not claim &quot;blood relation&quot; but consider each other as family due to their membership in the same clan. This is expressed by their using the same kinship titles for both family and clan relations. For example, clan members of approximately the same age consider each other &quot;brother&quot; and &quot;sister&quot;, even if they have never met before. Muscogee clans are as follows, an asterisk indicates extinction:&lt;ref name=AAANativeArts&gt;

===Clothing===
Ancestral Muscogee peoples wore clothing made of woven plant materials or animal skins, depending upon the climate. During the summer, they preferred lightweight fabrics woven from tree bark, grasses or reeds. During the harsh winters, they used animal skins and fur for warmth.

During the 17th century, the Muscogee adapted elements of European fashion and materials.  As cloth was more comfortable and colorful than buckskin, it quickly became a popular trade item throughout the region.  Buying bolts of cloth in a variety of patterns and textures, enabled Muscogee women to develop new styles of clothing, which they made for both men and women. They incorporated trade novelties and trinkets such as bells, ribbons, beads and pieces of mirror in the clothing.

===Language===
{{Main|Creek Language}}

The Muscogee language is a member of the [[Muskogean]] family and was well known among the frontiersmen, such as [[Gideon Lincecum]] , of the early 19th century. The language is related to the Choctaw language and with some words being identical in pronunciation. The following table is an example of Muscogee text and its translation:

When hunting, he always knew his dogs had an animal trapped by the sound of their barking.&lt;ref name=creek_language /&gt;

==Treaties==
[[Image:Map of Land Ceded by Treaty of Fort Jackson.png|275px|right|thumb|Ceded area as deemed by the Treaty of Fort Jackson in 1814.]]

Land was the most valuable asset, which the Native Americans held in collective stewardship. The southern English colonies, US government and settlers systematically obtained Muscogee land through treaties, legislation, and warfare. Some treaties, such as the [[Treaty of San Lorenzo]], indirectly affected the Muscogee. The treaties were:

===Indian Appropriations Act of 1871===

In 1871 Congress added a rider to the Indian Appropriations Act to end the United States' recognizing additional Indian tribes or nations, and prohibiting additional treaties.

{{cquote|''That hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty: Provided, further, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to invalidate or impair the obligation of any treaty heretofore lawfully made and ratified with any such Indian nation or tribe.''|20px|20px|-Indian Appropriations Act of 1871&lt;ref name=App_act&gt;
