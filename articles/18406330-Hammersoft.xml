'''Salvatore Miceli''' (born April 12, 1946, in Salemi) is a member of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[Mafia]]. He was on the &quot;[[List of most wanted fugitives in Italy|Most wanted list]]&quot; of the Italian Ministry of the Interior from 2001 until his arrest in Venezuela in June 2009.

==Biography==
Miceli was born in [[Salemi]], [[Italy]], in the [[province of Trapani]]. He was the grandson of the notorious heroin trafficker [[Salvatore Zizzo (Mafia)|Salvatore Zizzo]].&lt;ref name=rel0106&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.parlamento.it/parlam/bicam/14/Antimafia/documenti/rel.conclusiva1.pdf Relazione conclusiva], Commissione parlamentare dâinchiesta sul fenomeno della criminalitÃ  organizzata mafiosa o similare, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Together with [[Roberto Pannunzi]], he is considered to be the intermediary between the Mafia and the Calabrian [['Ndrangheta]] clans with Colombian cocaine cartels. He was involved in a cocaine trafficking network with [[Mariano Agate]], the Mafia boss of [[Mazara del Vallo]] and Calabrian clans of Marando, Trimboli and [[Barbaro 'ndrina|Barbaro]] from [[PlatÃ¬]].&lt;ref name=aduc300503&gt;{{it icon}} [http://droghe.aduc.it/php_artshow_8704.html Italia.

The ring was dismantled in May 2003 â but Miceli remained at large. His wife Veronica Dudzinski and his sons Ivano and Mario Miceli were arrested in May 2003, when the cocaine trafficking network was disrupted.&lt;ref name=mes010603&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.cuntrastamu.org/mafia/news/notizia.php?insid=1358 Dalla cella dava ordini al figlio laureato], Il Messaggero, June 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Mafia turncoats ([[pentito|pentiti]]) referred to Miceli as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, due to his frequent trips abroad. Others called him &quot;the chicken that lays golden eggs&quot;, referring to his lucrative drug business.&lt;ref name=rep210609b/&gt;

In the beginning of the 1990s, after a failed cocaine transport, Mafia boss [[Giovanni Brusca]] condemned Miceli to death. However, he was saved thanks to the intervention of [[Vincenzo Sinacori]] and [[Matteo Messina Denaro]] â the boss of [[Castelvetrano]] â who made clear that Miceli belonged to the Mafia in the [[province of Trapani]], and that the &quot;palermitani&quot; could not act against him without the permission of the Mafia bosses of Trapani.&lt;ref name=ad33/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep210609b&gt;{{it icon}} [http://palermo.repubblica.it/dettaglio/salvatore-miceli-il-ministro-degli-esteri-di-cosa-nostra/1656827 Salvatore Miceli, 'il ministro degli Esteri' di Cosa Nostra], La Repubblica, June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==

On June 20, 2009, Salvatore Miceli was arrested by police in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]. The arrest was made after a joint operation between Italian and Venezuelan authorities and [[Interpol]] agents.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8111885.stm 'Mafia man' arrested in Venezuela], [[BBC News]], June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reu210609&gt;[http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-40490620090621 Italian mafia boss arrested in Venezuela], Reuters, June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was apprehended as he left his house on Sunday, along with two other unnamed Italian suspects.&lt;ref name=ap210609&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hV_o2FzMxD_lM0FEcal6UM8XlP5wD98V31VO0 Top Italian Mafia fugitive arrested in Caracas], [[The Associated Press]], June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Miceli, who had been on the run from authorities since 2001, had been under police surveillance for three days prior to his arrest.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep210609&gt;{{it icon}} [http://palermo.repubblica.it/dettaglio/mafia-arrestato-in-venezuela-il-boss-salvatore-miceli/1656815 Mafia, arrestato in Venezuela: Il boss Salvatore Miceli], La Repubblica, June 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The former head of Italy's [[Antimafia Commission|Antimafia parliamentary commission]], [[Giuseppe Lumia]], suggested that Miceli's arrest would be a major blow to the [[Cosa Nostra|Sicilian Mafia]] and their trans-Atlantic drug trafficking operations.&lt;ref name=reu210609/&gt; 

Venezuela extradited Miceli to Italy on June 30, 2009, to serve his prison term. He was convicted for drug trafficking and Mafia conspiracy in 2001.&lt;ref name=rep300609&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.repubblica.it/2009/03/sezioni/cronaca/mafia-7/miceli-estradato/miceli-estradato.html Il Venezuela estrada il boss Miceli], La Repubblica, June 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he again has been charged for cocaine trafficking between Colombia, Sicily and Calabria.&lt;ref name=ad220609&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.antimafiaduemila.com/content/view/17132/84/ Cosa Nostra e i narcos: la storia di Salvatore Miceli, il boss del narcotraffico], Antmafia Duemila, June 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
