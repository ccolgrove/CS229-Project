==Timeline==
*'''June 14, 1961''' - DYCB-TV 3, the first provincial TV station in the Philippines, was launched by ABS-CBN (then known as Bolinao Electronics Corporation). It first aired a four-hour-a-day schedule (6:00-10:00pm), transmitting on a 50-mile radius within Cebu and nearby islands. The station's 390-foot transmission tower (then the tallest structure in Cebu) was originally from the network's flagship TV station, [[DWWX-TV|DZAQ-TV 3]], used during the first telecasts in 1953.

*'''1973''' - After the declaration of Martial Law by then-President [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and the takeover of ABS-CBN by his crony, Roberto Benedicto, DYCB-TV reopened as DYCW-TV, and became part of the [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]] (along with another ABS-CBN provincial stations, [[DYXL-TV|DYXL-TV 4]] in Bacolod and [[DYAF-TV]] in Iloilo).

*'''1978''' - Channel 3 became an owned-and-operated station of the government-owned GTV (later the Maharlika Broadcasting System, now [[National Broadcasting Network]]). The call letters were reverted to the original DYCB-TV.

*'''1986''' - DYCB-TV reopened under ABS-CBN, its original owner.

*'''1987''' - DYCB-TV introduced the ''Star Network'' with the famous numerical [[gold]] tri-[[ribbon]] channel 3 logo with a star.

*'''1988''' - [[TV Patrol Central Visayas]] becomes the first flagship newscast.

*'''1989''' - DYCB-TV setup its domestic satellite broadcast from Manila.
