The '''2011 United Kingdom anti-austerity protests''' were a series of [[anti-austerity protests]] that took place in the [[United Kingdom]] in early 2011.  While agreeing that the country faced a financial crisis, organisations including some UK [[trade unions]], argued that the [[United Kingdom coalition government (2010âpresent)|Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government]] was pushing deep spending cuts rapidly and without proper consultations or consideration for the impact on the public.  They believed that most of the government cuts were targeting workers, while big businesses, and financial businesses in particular, were going unpunished, despite the latter being the main reason for the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis]] and the subsequent [[Late-2000s recession|recession]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfnews.com/business/opinion/london-faces-a-summer-of-strike-chaos-over-austerity-1.829578&lt;/ref&gt;  

Earlier demonstrations led to a major event, the ''[[March for the Alternative]]'', on March 26, 2011 coordinated by the [[Trades Union Congress]] with a crowd of 500,000 people taking to [[London]]'s streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 110326 Anti-cuts&quot;&gt;[http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/03/26/anti-cuts-march-for-the-alternative-draws-500000-protestors-in-london/ Anti-cuts March for the Alternative draws 500,000 protestors in London]; Time Magazine - News Feed; 26 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=live&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8407260/TUC-protest-march-live.html|title=TUC protest march: live|date=26 March 2011|accessdate=26 March 2011|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|first1=Patrick|last1=Sawer|first2=Laura|last2=Donnelly|first3=Michael|last3=Howie|first4=David|last4=Barrett|first5=Ben|last5=Leach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/blog/2011/mar/26/march-for-the-alternative-live-blog-updates March for the Alternative Updates]; The Guardian; 26 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Further smaller demonstrations led up to a second big event, ''J30'', on June 30. This was marked by major rallies in [[London]], [[Brighton]], [[Sheffield]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], and massive strike actions by teachers and public sector workers.

==Background==
In May 2010, the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|United Kingdom general election]] resulted in no political party achieving sufficient support to form a working majority government on their own. For this reason, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and [[Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democratic Party]] entered into [[United Kingdom coalition government (2010âpresent)|a coalition government]] together. The Conservative leader [[David Cameron]] became Prime Minister whilst Liberal Democrat leader [[Nick Clegg]] became Deputy Prime Minister.

The government planned to put into action sharp spending cuts, stating that they were necessary to address the UK's record peacetime [[Government budget deficit|deficit]], with the UK finance minister, [[George Osborne]], saying that Britain risks suffering a debt crisis like those seen in [[Greece]], [[Ireland]] and [[Portugal]] if it fails to reduce the budget deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/UPDATE-1-Osborne-Euro-zone-targetukfocus-1207082316.html?x=0 |title=UPDATE 1-Osborne: Euro zone crisis shows debt dangers for UK - Yahoo!

The planned spending cuts include most government departments, which involves around 300,000 public service jobs ending and other civil servants receiving pay freezes.

The organisers of the protest say that the Government's plans to eliminate the deficit in four years, and to focus on cutting spending rather than raising tax, do not have national support. They say they want to give a voice to all the people affected by the cuts, and to demonstrate to Westminster that the public rejects the argument that there is no alternative. They and many protesters argue that the cuts will threaten the country's economic recovery.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time 110326 Anti-cuts&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP London&quot;/&gt; They suggest that since the government recently spent billions bailing out indebted banks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.marketturmoil | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Credit crunch (Business),Business,Market turmoil,World news,UK news,Economic policy,Politics,Banking (Business sector),Financial crisis (Business) | date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=487951&amp;in_page_id=2 |title=Bank of England: Bailout bill over Â£1 trillion |publisher=This is Money |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government should create new taxes for banks and close loopholes that allow some companies to pay less tax. Labour MP Chuka Umuuna declared that it was &quot;shocking&quot; to learn that Barclay's Bank paid only 1% of its 2009 profits in taxes while the corporate tax in the UK is 28%.

The march followed the [[2010 UK student protests|student protests]] of November and December 2010, which focused on cuts and changes to the funding of higher and further education in England. A previous student protest had descended into violence when students attacked the automobile in which [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and his wife [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]] were riding.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/03/27/3174735.htm?section=justin|title=Anti-austerity protesters descend on London|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=27 March 2011|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the protests represent &quot;the biggest public backlash against the Government's spending cuts since it came to power.&quot;&lt;ref name=live/&gt;

==January and February protests==
On 29 January, the NCAFC (National Campaign Against Cuts &amp; Fees) held a small protest in London. Some minor violence was reported. In Manchester there was a protest of around 5000 people called by the TUC, UCU and the NUS against fees and cuts, billed as &quot;a future that works&quot; rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jan/29/student-protesters-nus-president | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tracy | last=McVeigh | title=Student protesters target NUS president | date=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 February, a disused building at the [[University of Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] was occupied and re-opened as the [[Free Hetherington]] anti-cuts space.

==November 30 strikes==
{{main|2011 UK public sector strikes}}
An additional one-day strike took place across the country on 30 November. The strike was organised by various unions with the [[Trade Union Congress]] calling it the biggest strike in a generation. Nearly two-thirds of England's 21,476 schools were closed, all but 33 of Scotland's 2,700 states schools were closed and 7,000 operations in hospitals were cancelled. Twenty-one arrests were made, as [[Occupy London]] activists marched from Piccadilly Circus to Panton House, the headquarters of international mining company [[Xstrata]], where the highest paid CEO in the [[United Kingdom]] works. The activists entered the building with a large banner saying &quot;All power to the 99%&quot; and subsequently entered onto the rooftop and strapped the banner to the front of the building. Videos of the violent arrests were posted on social-video site [[YouTube]], including a video showing an undercover police officer, tasked with infiltrating the [[Occupy London]] march. A total of 75 activist-related arrests were logged in the capital that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15953806 |title=Public sector strike rallies held across UK |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2011-11-30 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public opinion==
{{Expand section|date=July 2011}}
A [[YouGov]] poll, published 26 March 2011, found that a 52% majority supported the protests &quot;to campaign against public sector spending cuts&quot; while 31% expressed opposition. 55% of voters believe that the cuts are necessary, against 32% who think they are unnecessary, but most feel the cuts are too deep and too fast. The same YouGov poll showed that 38% blame Labour for the cuts, 23% blame the coalition and 26% blame both. The results contained a strong partisan divide, with 83% of Labour supporters and only 19% of Tory supporters backing the protests. [[YouGov]] had surveyed 2,720 adults online between 20â21 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/03/cuts-blame-public-economy How unpopular are the cuts now?]; New Statesman; 25 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/industrial/tuc-19397-f0.cfm|title=Majority back aims of TUC March for the Alternative|date=25 March 2011|publisher=[[Trades Union Congress]]|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a Reuters/Ipsos MORI poll in June 2011 found around an even divide over whether public sector workers are right to strike about cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.omanobserver.om/node/56468 |title=Strike in Britain as protests hit Europe &amp;#124; Oman Observer |publisher=Main.omanobserver.om |date= |accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]] [[Michael Gove]] said on [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|BBC's Radio 4 Today]] early on the morning of 26 March , &quot;Of course people will feel a sense of disquiet, in some cases anger, at what they see happening, but the difficulty we have as the Government inheriting a terrible economic mess, is that we have to take steps to bring the public finances back into balance.&quot; He also speculated that the march could &quot;move from being [a] family event into being something darker&quot;.&lt;ref name=live/&gt;

[[Daniel Hannan]], a journalist and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] for [[South East England (European Parliament constituency)|South East England]], stated that the protesters &quot;have decided to indulge their penchant for empty, futile, self-righteous indignation.&quot; He wrote, &quot;After âNo Cuts!â the marchersâ favourite slogan was âFairness!â Alright, then...
