Commercial video games released as freeware are games that, in their original license, were not considered [[freeware]], but were re-released at a later date with a freeware license, sometimes as publicity for a forthcoming sequel or compilation release.

Some of the following games are not [[freely redistributable software]], as they have only been made available as a free download as freeware, but may only be downloaded from certain websites and with the explicit permission of the copyright owner. Consult the [[software license agreement]].

For games that were originally released as freeware, see [[List of freeware video games]]. For [[FLOSS]] games, and proprietary games re-released as FLOSS, see [[List of open source video games]].

==Available games==
The following formerly paid games have been made available as freeware, and are still in that status:
