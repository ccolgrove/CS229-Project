{{Politics of Egypt}}
A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Egypt]] on 19 March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zayan |first=Jailan |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gLzgMRN5vmANBUJBTJJqvayXqWEg?docId=CNG.0f69b85278e292f4cec1b79291e88739.671 |title=AFP: New Egypt PM addresses crowds in Tahrir Square |publisher=Google.com |date=2011-03-04 |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]]. More than 14 million (77%) were in favour, while around 4 million (23%) opposed the changes; 41% of 45 million eligible voters turned out to vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Maggie |last=Michael |url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/956926--constitutional-amendments-approved-in-egypt-referendum |title=Constitutional amendments approved in Egypt referendum |publisher=The Star |date=2011-03-11 |accessdate=2011-03-21 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approved constitutional reforms included a limitation on the presidency to at most [[term limit|two six-year terms]], [[Judiciary|judicial]] supervision of elections, a requirement for the president to appoint a deputy, a commission to draft a new constitution following the parliamentary election, and easier access to presidential elections by candidatesâvia 30,000 signatures from at least 15 provinces, 30 members of a chamber of the legislature, or nomination by a party holding at least one seat in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/331837 |title=Commission announces proposed changes to Egyptian Constitution &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms were recognised by both sides to increase democratic safeguards, but opponents argued that they did not go far enough and that an election held too soon could favour the well-organised [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and members of the former ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]] of [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Supporters cited concerns that waiting too long could increase the chances of the [[Egyptian military|military]] regaining power or risk destabilisation before an election.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar1&quot;/&gt;

A [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary election]] is planned within the next six months, with groups already working to create new political parties, promote candidates and increase turnout among their supporters.

== Background ==
{{see|History of the Egyptian Constitution}}
The 1971 [[Constitution of Egypt|constitution]] was suspended by the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] on 13 February 2011, two days after the resignation of [[Hosni Mubarak]]. It then organised a [[Egypt Constitutional Review Committee of 2011|committee of jurists]] to draft amendments to pave the way for new parliamentary and presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gyvIy92hyHZzDwY3N_T-NwAdrdeQ?docId=CNG.64b40623ef755670eb1e7e108c8d3448.801 |title=Egypt cyber activists say they met military rulers |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/27/us-egypt-referendum-idUSTRE71Q11620110227 |title=Egypt to call March referendum this week: lawyer |publisher=Reuters |date= 2011-02-27|accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had the referendum resulted in a &quot;no&quot; vote, the 1971 constitution would have been nullified and a new one was to be drawn up before elections, which would likely have extended the planned transition period until an election to 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12763313 |title=BBC News - Q&amp;A: Egypt's constitutional referendum |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2011 Egyptian Constitutional Referendum process in English.svg|thumb|A diagram that explains the 2011 Egyptian Constitutional Referendum process based on a Yes or No vote on 19 March 2011]]
The [[Egyptian military]] called for a media silence over the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/360922 Egypt military calls for media silence on referendum beginning Friday], ''[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]]''&lt;/ref&gt; It also set up a committee to review the proposed amendmends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/348045 Armed Forces form committee to analyze opposition to amendments], ''[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Later saying it would help to secure a vote on the proposed amendments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/352530 Army to help secure vote on Constitution changes], ''[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposition coalition (including presidential candidates [[Amr Moussa]] and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], the [[New Wafd Party]], the [[Coalition of the Youth of the Revolution]], the [[National Progressive Unionist Party]], the [[el-Ghad Party]] and the [[Egyptian Arab Socialist Party]]) criticised the proposed amendments as not enough and that the new constitution needs to be written immediately to regulate the process and the requirements for [[members of parliament]]. They also said that the President's power was not limited enough under the proposed changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;

The [[Christianity in Egypt|Christian Church]] was also opposed to the amendments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/354356 Source: Church rejects proposed constitutional amendments], ''[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]]''&lt;/ref&gt; as was the reformist faction of the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/362657 Muslim Brotherhood reformist wing rejects constitutional amendments], ''[[Al-Masry Al-Youm]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

They have suggested that Article 2 of the constitution (which states that &quot;[[Islam]] is the Religion of the State. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is its official language, and the principal source of legislation is [[Sharia|Islamic Jurisprudence]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/laws/constitution/chp_one/part_one.aspx |title=EgyptÃ¢â¬â¢s Government Services Portal - Egypt Constitution - Chapter one: The State |publisher=Egypt.gov.eg |date= |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;) will be removed or altered if the proposed changes are not approved even though the constitutional amendment committee said that Article 2 will not be touched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/324621 |title=Constitutional amendment committee: Article II will not be touched &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date=2011-02-20 |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheikh [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] advised Egyptians to approve the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=422881&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |title=Gulf Times â Qatarâs top-selling English daily newspaper - Qatar |publisher=Gulf-times.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|NDP]] also have asked their base to vote Yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/1/64/7971/Egypt/Politics-/Egyptian-Islamists,-along-with-NDP,-campaign-hard-.aspx |title=Egyptian Islamists, along with NDP, campaign hard for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote on Constitutional amendments - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2011-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim Brotherhood and the NDP are also perceived to be in favour of an approval because early elections could benefit them the most as they already have the biggest grassroots support while smaller and newly founded parties would have little time to prepare for elections in the planned schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;
