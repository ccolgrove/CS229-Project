The '''University of Utah''', also known as '''the U''' or '''the U of U''', is a [[public university|public]], [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] [[research university]] in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], United States.  The university was established in 1850 as the University of Deseret by the General Assembly of the provisional [[State of Deseret]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot; /&gt; making it Utah's oldest institution of higher education.&lt;ref name=&quot;fast facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Fast Facts | url=http://www.obia.utah.edu/content/fastfacts.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=University of Utah | accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received its current name in 1892, four years before Utah attained statehood, and moved to its current location in 1900.&lt;ref name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot; /&gt;

The university offers more than 100 undergraduate majors and more than 90 graduate degree programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;fast facts&quot; /&gt; Graduate studies include the [[S.J.

A Board of Regents was organized by [[Brigham Young]] to establish a university in the Salt Lake Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/thebeginningsoftheuniversityofutah.html |title=The Beginnings of the University of Utah |author=Yvette D. Ison |date=January 1995 |accessdate=5 October 2011 |work= |publisher=[[State of Utah]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established on February 28, 1850, as the ''University of Deseret'' by the General Assembly of the provisional [[State of Deseret]], and [[Orson Spencer]] was appointed as the first chancellor of the university. Early classes were held in private homes or wherever space could be found. The university closed in 1853 due to lack of funds and lack of [[feeder school]]s.

Following years of intermittent classes in the Salt Lake City [[Council House (Salt Lake City)|Council House]], the university began to be reestablished in 1867 under the direction of [[David O. Calder]], who was followed by [[John R. Park]] in 1869.  The university moved out of the council house into the Union Academy building in 1876 and into Union Square in 1884. In 1892, the school's name was changed to the University of Utah, and [[John R. Park]] began arranging to obtain land belonging to the U.S. Army's [[Fort Douglas (Utah)|Fort Douglas]] on the east bench of the [[Salt Lake Valley]], where the university moved permanently in 1900. Additional [[Fort Douglas (Utah)|Fort Douglas]] land has been granted to the university over the years, and the fort was officially closed on October 26, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Brief History of Fort Douglas | url=http://www.fortdouglas.org/fdhist.htm | publisher=Fort Douglas Military Museum Association | accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death in 1900, Dr. John R.

[[File:UofU campus close-up early 1920s.jpg|thumb|right|The University of Utah campus in the early 1920s]]

The university grew rapidly in the early 20th century but was involved in an [[academic freedom]] controversy in 1915 when [[Joseph T. Kingsbury]] recommended that five faculty members be dismissed after a graduation speaker made a speech critical of mayor [[William Spry]]. One third of the faculty resigned in protest of these dismissals. Some felt that the dismissals were a result of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]]'s influence on the university, while others felt that they reflected a more general pattern of repressing religious and political expression that might be deemed offensive. The controversy was largely resolved when Kingsbury resigned in 1916, but university operations were again interrupted by World War I, and later [[The Great Depression]] and World War II. Student enrollment dropped to a low of 3,418 during the last year of World War II, but [[A. Ray Olpin]] was able to make substantial additions to campus following the war, and enrollment reached 12,000 by the time he retired in 1964. Growth continued throughout the following decades as the university developed into a center for computer, medical, and other research.&lt;ref name=&quot;sesquicentennial&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;transition&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexander|first=Thomas G.|authorlink=Thomas G.

==Student life==
[[Image:Uofu union.jpg|thumb|right|[[A.

An additional 1,115 family apartments are available to students, staff, and faculty. One of the university's primary four goals for long-term campus growth is to increase student engagement through the addition of on-campus housing, intramural fields, athletic centers, and a new [[student activity center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;plan elements&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facilities.utah.edu/static-content/facilitiesmanagement/files/pdf/2008_UofU_CMP_5_Plan_Elements.pdf|title=Plan Elements (50 MB)|year=2008 | format=PDF|work=Campus Master Plan|publisher=University of Utah|accessdate=2009-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current student activity center, the [[A.
