The '''EaglesâGiants rivalry''' involves the [[National Football League]] teams the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and the [[New York Giants]]. The rivalry dates back to 1933. However, the competition began to heat up when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The rivalry is mainly based on the two teams being in the same division in the NFL since 1933 and the geographic [[New York City|New York]]-[[Philadelphia]] rivalry. It is ranked by Sports Illustrated as amongst the top ten NFL rivalries of all-time at #4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/2005/12/15/gallery.oldrivals/content.7.html|title=Top 10 NFL Rivalries Of All Time: No. 4 Giants-Eagles|publisher=si.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the geographic rivalry between the Eagles and Giants is well known in football circles, meriting mention on ESPN.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3086647&amp;type=Columnist&amp;imagesPrint=off|title=Ranking the NFL's best rivalries: Where does Colts-Pats fit?|last=Chadiha|first=Jeffri|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2007-10-31|accessdate=2008-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable rivalry moments==
{{recentism|date=September 2011}}
* The Giants/Eagles rivalry is the oldest of the [[NFC East]] rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933 and has been called the best rivalry in the NFL in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=BestRivalry&gt;{{cite news|title=The Birds' Biggest Rival&amp;mdash;In a division of fierce foes, the Giants have battled the Eagles as tough as anyone|date=September 17, 2006|first=Bob|last=Brookover|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eagles&amp;mdash;Giants among top rivalries|date=November 6, 2008|first=Bob|last=Brookover|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ernie Accorsi]], general manager of the Giants from 1998 until his retirement after the {{nfly|2006}} season, saw his first NFL game between the teams back in 1951 in his native Hershey, Pa., and grew up as an Eagles fan.&lt;ref name=BestRivalry/&gt;
* In a 1960 game, the Eagles' [[Chuck Bednarik]] cleanly blindsided Giants running back [[Frank Gifford]], sending Gifford into an 18-month retirement due to a severe concussion.&lt;ref name=BestRivalry/&gt;
* On November 19, 1978 at Giants Stadium, the Giants were leading the Eagles 17-12 with 20 seconds remaining. Offenseive coordinator Bob Gibson called for a running play when all that was needed was for the Giants to take a knee. The handoff between quarterback Joe Pisarcik and Larry Csonka was fumbled and Eagles cornerback Herman Edwards grabbed the loose ball and returned it for the winning score. This play is commonly referred to as [[The Miracle at the Meadowlands]] by Eagles fans and just &quot;The Fumble&quot; by Giants fans.
* On January 7, 2001 in a divisional playoff game, the Giants defeated the Eagles 20-10 thanks to Ron Dixon's 97-yard kickoff return and Jason Sehorn's acrobatic 32-yard interception return. This win would help propel the Giants to [[Super Bowl XXXV]] which they ultimately lost to the [[Baltimore Ravens]] 34-7.
* In the two teams' first meeting of the 2006 season, Philadelphia held a 17-point lead going into the fourth quarter. However, the Giants rallied to tie the game, and go into overtime. In overtime, Giants quarterback Eli Manning threw a game winning touchdown pass to WR Plaxico Burress, and the Giants won 30-24. In the second meeting, the Eagles behind quarterback Jeff Garcia (who had replaced Donovan McNabb due to injury to McNabb a few weeks earlier) would get some payback in a 36-22 victory, which was capped with DE Trent Cole intercepting a pass from Manning (who was getting hit and he ended up throwing the ball up in the air) and returning it for a touchdown. They would meet for a third time in the 2006-2007 playoffs, where the Giants rallied to tie the game at 20 in a late fourth quarter drive; the Eagles then executed a textbook late-game rush-oriented drive and won on a game-ending field goal, 23-20.
* The two teams split their 2008 meetings.  The Giants rallied to edge the Eagles in [[Lincoln Financial Field|Philly]] 36-31, then the Eagles stymied New York's offense en route to a 20-14 win at [[Giants Stadium]]. They met again on January 11, 2009 in the 2008 NFC Divisional Playoffs at [[Giants Stadium]], the fourth career playoff matchup between the two as #6 seed Philadelphia Eagles defeated the top-seeded New York Giants 23-11, leaving the series tied 2-2 in the playoffs; it was also the 11th time in the 2000s that the road team won.
*On [[Miracle at the New Meadowlands|December 19, 2010]], the Giants led the Eagles 31-10 with 7:28 left in the first game between the teams at [[New Meadowlands Stadium]] where first place in the NFC East was on the line. But the Eagles would rally to tie the score, then win the game on [[DeSean Jackson]]'s 65 yard punt return for a touchdown with no time left on the clock for a shocking 38-31 victory.&lt;ref name=NewMeadowlands&gt;{{cite news|title=MIRACLE AT THE NEW MEADOWLANDS&amp;mdash;Comeback, runback give Birds their East edge back|date=December 20, 2010|first=Jeff|last=McLane|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Elias Sports Bureau]] also believes that this is the first walk-off punt return in NFL history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=22937|title=The First Walk-Off Punt Return In History?|work=www.philadelphiaeagles.com|date=December 19, 2010|first=Chris|last=McPhersonm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Giants went on to miss the playoffs, despite finishing tied for first with the Eagles at 10-6,&lt;ref name=2010Season&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/recap?gid=20110102028&amp;print=1|title=Giants beat Redskins 17-14, but miss playoffs|date=January 2, 2011|accessdate=January 3, 2011|first=Howard|last=Fendrich|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|quote=The Giants (10-6) and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are the first NFC teams since 1991 to miss out on the postseason despite double-digit victory totals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Eagles lost their last two games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pack Coming Back&amp;mdash;Eagles fall to Cowboys, start preparing for rematch with Green Bay|date=January 3, 2011|first=Jeff|last=McLane|newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Going into their first match-up of the 2011 season on September 25, 2011 the [[New York Giants]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] seemed like two teams going in two different directions.  While the Eagles, which some had nicknamed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, had had a very strong off season which saw several big free agent signings including [[Cullen Jenkins]] formerly of the Green Bay Packers, [[Nnamdi Asomugha]] formerly of the Oakland Raiders, and [[Vince Young]] formerly of the Tennessee Titans, the Giants lost many key free agents including tight end Kevin Boss and wide receiver Steve Smith.  The loss of Steve Smith was particularly bitter for Big Blue as he signed with the Eagles.  Even more devastating, the Giants entered the season with 8 players on injured reserve including starters Terrell Thomas (CB) and Jonathan Goff (MLB).  Additionally the Giants lost Domenik Hixon (WR) for the season the week before the game and had [[Mario Manningham]] (#2 wide receiver), [[Prince Amukamara]] (1st round draft pick and corner back) and [[Osi Umenyiora]] (pro-bowl defensive end) ruled out for the game as well.  No one gave the Giants a chance to win the game decimated as they were with injuries&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/nfceast/post/_/id/30889/rapid-reaction-giants-29-eagles-16&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Giants rallied around their remaining players and refused to give up any big plays to the Eagles.  After victimizing the Eagles defense with two huge plays, a 40 yard touchdown pass to Brandon Jacobs&lt;ref&gt;scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=310925021&lt;/ref&gt;, and a 74 yard touchdown pass to rookie Victor Cruz&lt;ref&gt;scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=310925021&lt;/ref&gt; the Giants took a stunning 14-0 lead by the end of the 1st quarter.  While the Eagles would take a 16-14 3rd quarter lead, the Giants rallied taking a 22-16 lead and knocked Eagles quarterback [[Michael Vick]] out of the game with a broken hand.  With Eagles back-up quarterback Mike Kafka entering the game the Giants intercepted two passes in the 4th quarter to ultimately win 29-16, stunning the Eagles faithful. This is also the Giants' only victory against the Eagles in their last 8 attempts, dating back to the 2008 season.
