'''Karl Helge Hampus Hellekant''', later '''Karl Svensson''' (born January 30, 1976 in [[Danderyd]], [[Stockholm County]]) is a Swedish [[neo-Nazi]] who was sentenced to 11 years of prison for the murder of [[syndicalist]] [[Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation|union]] member [[BjÃ¶rn SÃ¶derberg]] on October 12, 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hellekant's efforts to become a physician, and his eventual dismissal from medical school at [[Karolinska Institutet|Karolinska Institute]], became a controversial case in [[medical ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob M. &quot;Sweden Asks:  Should Convicted Murderers Practice Medicine?&quot; ''Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, Vol. 19, No. 4, Oct. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Murder of BjÃ¶rn SÃ¶derberg ==
On September 16, 1999, the [[syndicalist]] newspaper ''[[Arbetaren]]'' revealed that [[Robert Vesterlund]], a prominent figure in the Swedish neo-Nazi movement, held a chair in the board of the local chapter of the [[Swedish Commercial Employees' Union]] at ''SvanstrÃ¶ms lager'' in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ab-omfattandebevis&quot;&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbetaren had received the information from a co-worker of Vesterlund, the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden|syndicalist union]] member BjÃ¶rn SÃ¶derberg.&lt;ref name=&quot;ab-omfattandebevis&quot;/&gt; A week later, Vesterlund was expelled from his union, and quit his job.&lt;ref name=&quot;ab-omfattandebevis&quot;/&gt;

Because of this, Hellekant and two friends, BjÃ¶rn Lindberg-Hernlund and Jimmy Niklasson, came to SÃ¶derberg's home in [[SÃ¤tra]] on October 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;ab-bjornhedrad&quot;&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A brawl ensued, and a few minutes later, SÃ¶derberg had been shot multiple times, including in the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;ab-bjornhedrad&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, he was caught while on temporary release from the prison, suspected of assisting a fellow inmate at the Hall prison in an escape attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;expressen-2005&quot;/&gt;  In February 2007, he was released on probation.&lt;ref name=&quot;dn-lakareutkastad&quot;/&gt;

== Medical school controversy ==

In the fall of 2007, Hellekant enrolled in [[medical school]] at the [[Karolinska University Hospital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dn-lakareutkastad&quot;/&gt; When his criminal history became known to the university as well as the media in early November, a debate ensued as to whether a convicted murderer should be allowed to practice medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;dn-lakareutkastad&quot;/&gt; While some commentators called for Hellekant to be expelled from the university,&lt;ref name=&quot;dn-lakareutkastad&quot;/&gt; Karolinska decided that he would be allowed to continue his studies, with head master Harriet Wallberg-Henriksson stating there was no legal way to expel him, as &quot;no national policy covers the situation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; She did however state that she considers it unethical to let convicted murderers practice medicine,&lt;ref name=&quot;dn-lakareutkastad&quot;/&gt; and that it would be hard for Hellekant to get a physicians' license from the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]], which is required to practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt; In January 2008 it was discovered that Hellekant apparently had falsified the name on his high school transcripts, and that the authenticity of his high school grades could not be verified. He was then expelled from Karolinska.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dn-lakareutkastad&quot;/&gt; However, in 2009 it was reported that Hellekant had been accepted to medical school at [[Uppsala University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Appel, Jacob M. &quot;Sweden Asks: Should Convicted Murderers Practice Medicine?&quot; Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics, Vol. 19, No. 4, Oct. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=SvÃ¤rdkrona|first=Zendry|title=DÃ¶md mÃ¶rdare vill bli lÃ¤kare â igen|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article4204904.ab|accessdate=5 October 2011|newspaper=Aftonbladet|date=18 January 2009|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case generated a debate within the medical community, both in Sweden and abroad, over the appropriate criteria for exclusion from medical school.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  Bioethicist [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]], an advocate for Hellekant, argued that &quot;medical authorities would be remiss if they overlooked the unique, positive characterisistics that a gifted ex-felon might bring to the profession&quot; and suggested that ex-felons might be well-suited to the distinctive demands of providing medical care within the prison system.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
