The '''Copa del Rey 1908''' was the 6th edition of the [[Copa del Rey]]. 

[[Athletic de Bilbao]] refused to participate, disgusted with the attitude of the people of Madrid in some games of the [[1907 Copa del Rey|previous tournament]]. Others teams invited, like the Catalonian champion X Sporting Club, decline the invitation for economical reasons. Finally, only two teams were inscribed: [[Real Madrid|Madrid FC]] and [[Real Vigo Sporting]]. 

The tournament was won by [[Real Madrid|Madrid FC]], who claimed their fourth Cup title in a row.
