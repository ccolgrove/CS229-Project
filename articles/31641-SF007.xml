'''UseModWiki''' is a [[wiki software|wiki engine]] written in the [[Perl]] programming language. It is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Pages in '''UseModWiki''' are stored in [[Flat file database|ordinary files]], not in a [[relational database]].  Something similar to the interface can be seen in [[MediaWiki]] with the classic skin.

== History ==

Clifford Adams based UseModWiki on the code of [[AtisWiki]] by Marcus Denker. AtisWiki was based on [[CvWiki]] by Peter Merel. CvWiki was the first GNU-licensed wiki based on [[WikiBase]], the wiki engine of the original [[WikiWikiWeb]] by [[Ward Cunningham]].

The first installation of UseModWiki was Adams's usemod.com wiki, the basis of the ''Use''net ''Mod''eration Project (Usemod) which had been running on AtisWiki since October 11, 1999. The second wiki to use UseModWiki, the [[MeatballWiki]] created by Adams and [[Sunir Shah]] dedicated to online communities, was installed on the usemod.com Web site on April 24, 2000.

From January 15, 2001 until early 2002, UseModWiki was also used to run [[Wikipedia]]. All language instances of Wikipedia have since been moved over to [[MediaWiki]].

[[WikiWikiWeb]]'s sister wiki [[WikiWikiWeb:TheAdjunct|the Adjunct]], started in July 2005, also runs on UseModWiki.
