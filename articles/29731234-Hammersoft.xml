The term '''Tirana derby''' refers to the [[local derby|local derbies]] in [[Tirana]] played between two of the three professional [[association football|football]] clubs [[KF Tirana]], [[Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo]] or [[Partizani Tirana|Partizani]]. It specifically refers to individual matches between the clubs, but can also be used to describe the general ongoing rivalry between the clubs, players and / or fans. 

Tirana is the only city in the [[Albania]] hosting three professional football clubs. The only other Albanian city to host more than one professional football club is [[Vlora]], home of [[Flamurtari VlorÃ«|Flamurtari]] and [[KF Vlora]]. However, the two Vlora clubs hardly play head-to-head due to KF Vlora's common lower division status.
