'''''Zoot Suit Riot: The Swingin' Hits of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies''''' (often shortened to '''''Zoot Suit Riot''''') is a [[compilation album]] by American [[ska]]-[[swing music|swing]] band the [[Cherry Poppin' Daddies]], released on March 18, 1997 on Space Age Bachelor Pad Records.

Self-produced by the Daddies to satisfy demand for their swing material while the group was between studio releases, ''Zoot Suit Riot'' consists of only the straight swing tracks compiled from the band's first three albums - which were predominantly [[punk rock|punk]] and ska-oriented - plus four [[bonus track]]s recorded exclusively for this compilation. 

Released independently in March 1997, ''Zoot Suit Riot'' was eventually re-issued and nationally distributed by major label subsidiary [[Mojo Records]] following the Daddies' signing to the label. By early 1998, steady airplay of its [[Zoot Suit Riot (song)|titular single]] propelled the album to the top of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Top Heatseekers]], helping serve as a catalyst for the short-lived [[swing revival]] of the late 1990s. At its peak, ''Zoot Suit Riot'' reached number seventeen on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over two million copies in the United States.

==Background==
By 1996, the Cherry Poppin' Daddies had eked out a living as a full-time independent band, having released three regionally successful studio albums and carving out a touring niche within the American [[third wave ska]] scene, consistently appearing as tour support for prominent ska bands such as [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]] and [[Reel Big Fish]] at a time when ska was just beginning to generate commercial interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cherry Poppin' Daddies: Swingin' Since 1989 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427059/19971021/cherry_poppin_daddies.jhtml |work= |publisher=[[MTV]].com |date=October 21, 1997 |accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michigan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Harwin, Lise |title=Cherry Poppers Come Into Detroit |url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1996/oct/10-09-96/arts/art5.html  |work= |publisher=''[[Michigan Daily]]'' |date=October 9, 1996 |accessdate=August 11, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041015223650/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1996/oct/10-09-96/arts/art5.html |archivedate = October 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the Daddies were almost exclusively playing ska-based tours at this time, the coincident radio success of the [[Squirrel Nut Zippers]] and [[Royal Crown Revue]] began drawing media attention towards the formerly underground [[swing revival]] movement. Before long, the Daddies were regularly attracting a separate, larger audience for their swing material, though soon came to realize the band lacked an album which fully represented the swing elements of their music, and more so lacked the finances to record a new one. Singer-songwriter [[Steve Perry (Oregon musician)|Steve Perry]] explained how the concept of a compilation came to be in an interview for ''[[The Daily of the University of Washington]]'':

{{cquote|We didn't want to be a &quot;swing band&quot;. What happened was that our manager said, &quot;Everybody comes up and they ask me which CD has the most swing on it,&quot; - that's what we mostly played live - &quot;and I don't know what the fuck to tell them because two of the CDs have the same amount and the other has less. So it's between these, and I don't know what to do. I swear to God, if you put all of those swing songs on one record, people would just shit. They would really want that, because how many people have all three Cherry Poppin' Daddies records?&quot; &quot;Well, none.&quot; &quot;Well, yeah. There you go.&quot; And I went, &quot;I don't think that a band from Eugene with three records could put a greatest hits record out.&quot; &quot;Then record some new songs.&quot; We had talked about it for a while, and we decided to do it. And it was cheap. So we did it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clayton&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Warped Tour Interview |author=Hollifield, Clayton |newspaper=[[The Daily of the University of Washington]] |date=July 7, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Release and impact==
After a brief recording period, ''Zoot Suit Riot'' was released through the Daddies' self-owned label [[Space Age Bachelor Pad Records]] on March 18, 1997. In its initial run, the album became an unexpectedly popular item, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.&lt;ref name=&quot;OregonLive&quot;&gt;Foyston, John. ['Cherry Poppin' Daddies'] ''OregonLive''. September 6, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Despite steady sales, however, securing wider distribution and marketing outside of the Northwest proved difficult through an entirely DIY label. Following a tour together, Reel Big Fish helped arrange a meeting between the Daddies and their label [[Mojo Records]] in the hopes of getting the band a [[distribution deal]], negotiations of which instead led to the Daddies being signed to a three-album [[recording contract|record deal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clayton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Focus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=Mark |year=1997 |month=September |title=Cherry Poppin' Daddies |journal=Focus Magazine |volume= |issue=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Zoot Suit Riot'' was re-issued and given national distribution by Mojo on July 1, 1997, less than four months after its original release.

By October 1997, the growing popularity of swing music had contributed to the increased sales of ''Zoot Suit Riot'', leading Mojo to issue one of the album's bonus tracks, &quot;[[Zoot Suit Riot (song)|Zoot Suit Riot]]&quot;, as a single and distribute it among [[modern rock]] radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tangents&quot;&gt;Fulmer, Carl &amp; Coston, Daniel. 'Tangents Magazine Interview'. ''Tangents Magazine''. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The Daddies, who were in preparation over recording a new studio album, protested Mojo's actions under their belief that a swing song would never receive airplay on mainstream radio and the band would have to recoup the costs of its marketing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clayton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lofi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kane |first=Laura |year=1998 |month= |title=Pop Your Cherry |journal=Lo-Fi Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Mojo went ahead with the plan, and to the band's surprise, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; soon found regular rotation on both [[college radio]] and major stations such as Los Angeles' [[KROQ-FM]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Chris |year=1998 |month= March |title=2 Daddies Swing Big |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |issue=Vol. 110, No. 12 |page=112 |issn=0006-2510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several months of regular rotation on KROQ-FM, ''Zoot Suit Riot'' eventually climbed to #1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' [[Top Heatseekers]] chart, going on to become the first album of the neo-swing revival to crack the top 40 of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number 17 and spending an ultimate total of 53 weeks on the charts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=305&amp;cfgn=Albums&amp;cfn=The+Billboard+200&amp;ci=3033295&amp;cdi=7414155&amp;cid=02%2F27%2F1999 Zoot Suit Riot - Billboard] www.billboard.com&lt;/ref&gt; The album surpassed sales of 500,000 in June 1998, eventually attaining [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] status on August 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;SkaSuit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Newfound Popularity of Ska Suits These Daddies Just Fine |author=Stout, Gene |newspaper=[[Eugene Weekly]] |date=July 3, 1998 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1998/9807030008.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Platinum&quot;&gt;MTV News.

The Daddies reached their commercial zenith in the summer of 1998, embarking on a world tour as part of the 1998 [[Warped Tour]] and receiving heavy media coverage, frequently appearing on television programs ranging from ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|The Tonight Show]]'' to ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and ''[[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'' 1998 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywood.com/tv/Dick_Clarks_New_Years_Rockin_Eve_99/5176001 'New Year's Rockin' Eve 1998-1999']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Richard [http://wweek.com/html/timbre050698.html 'Timbre'] [[Willamette Week]]. May 6, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The surrealistic [[music video]] for &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, directed by [[pornography|pornographer]] [[Gregory Dark]], was nominated for a &quot;Best New Artist in a Video&quot; award at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]]. [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]] even recorded a parody of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; on his 1999 album ''[[Running with Scissors (album)|Running with Scissors]]'', reworked as &quot;Grapefruit Diet&quot;.

Two additional singles were released from ''Zoot Suit Riot'': &quot;Brown Derby Jump&quot;, for which a music video was filmed, and a rerecorded and rearranged version of &quot;Here Comes the Snake&quot;, a track which originally appeared on the band's 1996 album ''[[Kids on the Street]]''. Both singles failed to chart.

''Zoot Suit Riot'' received mixed reviews from critics. On the positive end of the critical spectrum, ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', comparing albums by the most popular artists of the swing revival, chose the Daddies as having &quot;the most effective music for the dance fad of the moment&quot;, citing the bands' &quot;suggestive lyrics and occasionally interesting musical textures&quot; as their most distinguishing quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Separating the Faddies From the Real Swingin' Daddies |author=Heckman, Don |newspaper=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=August 2, 1998 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/02/entertainment/ca-9310}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the Daddies as &quot;one of the few neo-swing bands that can win over a skeptic with their rhythm section&quot;, noting Perry's lyricism as having &quot;an inventiveness missing from most of the other swing bands' lyrics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Critic's Notebook: It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing |author=Ratliff, Ben |newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=April 7, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pif Magazine]]'', at first approaching the album with skepticism, ultimately remarked &quot;the Cherry Poppin' Daddies do not take one false step on ''Zoot Suit Riot''&quot;, delivering most of their praise on its lyricism and anti-retro rhetoric, noting &quot;this is not a band that is trying to sell pants, but a serious band that is interested in traditional forms of American music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zoot Suit Riot &gt; Overview |url=http://www.pifmagazine.com/1998/09/zoot-suit-riot/ |work= |publisher=[[Pif Magazine]] |date=September 1, 1998 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the negative end, [[allmusic]] gave the album a rating of 2.5 out of 5 stars, noting that while the band pulled off &quot;reasonably infectious&quot; tunes, the lyrics had lent ''Zoot Suit Riot'' a &quot;condescending Gen-X attitude, as well as a lack of understanding about what made swing fun&quot;, writing the album off as a &quot;smirking hipster joke, only without any humor and very little music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Erlewine, Thomas |title=Zoot Suit Riot &gt; Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r278005|pure_url=yes}} |work= |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz critic [[Scott Yanow]], in his 2000 book ''Swing!'', labeled the Daddies as the perfect &quot;whipping boy for the Retro Swing movement&quot;, noting &quot;The Daddies sound as if they are a [[punk rock]] band who has chosen to masquerade as swing...the rhythm section has difficulty swinging, the vocals are often profane...the music, although excitable in spots, usually comes dangerously close to [[camp (style)|camp]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swing!&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Swing! |last=Yanow |first=Scott |year=2000 |publisher=Miller Freeman |isbn=0-87930-600-9 |pages=463â464 |accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
