On July 12, 2009, WBGN-CD began broadcasting digitally in the Pittsburgh area on physical channel 16 (485&amp;nbsp;MHz), the former analog designation of [[WINP-TV]].

The main WBGN signal plus all of its satellite stations signed off their analog signals on June 22, 2010, since many fell within the [[channel 52]]-[[channel 69|69]] spectrum that was freed up for other uses by the FCC. Like the main signal, the digital signal in New Castle airs on a former analog designation, in this case [[channel 27]], the former analog home of [[CBS]] affiliate [[WKBN-TV]] in [[Youngstown, Ohio]] as does the digital signal in Greensburg which airs on the former analog designation of [[The CW Television Network|CW]] affiliate [[WPCW]] Pittsburgh/Jeanette, PA. As of July 28, 2010 WBGN and all of its satellite stations including New Castle (WPCP), Butler (WNNB), Beaver (WJMB), and Greensburg (WEMW) are transmitting digitally.

Currently four standard definition channels are being provided by the station.
