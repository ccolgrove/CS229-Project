==Popular culture==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
East L.A. is a major hub of the Los Angeles area's large Hispanic (esp. Mexican) population. The development began in the 1910s when the first wave of Mexican immigrants settled down in the east sides of L.A. In the 1920s, many east L.A. residents were in fact [[Jewish American|Jewish]] European immigrants and their families, then began to relocate outward since the 1920s. Older [[English American|Anglo]] (non-Hispanic white) residents also relocated en masse and by 1950, the community became majority Mexican-American. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Later, East L.A. was a hotbed of activity during the [[Chicano]] rights movement in the 1960s. East L.A. of the 1970s and 80s developed a double reputation for poverty, high crime, street gangs and illegal drug trafficking, but romanticized for the strength of a small-knit family-oriented Hispanic culture and a strong sense of community. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The Boyle Heights and Lincoln Heights areas of Los Angeles are often mistakenly referred to as East L.A. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} although it's the eastern section of original Los Angeles in the late 19th century.  

East L.A. was both the origin and destination of [[Cheech Marin]] in both the song and the movie [[Born in East L.A.]].  At the end of the song (which was a parody of [[Born in the U.S.A.]]), he parodies [[Randy Newman]]'s [[I Love L.A.]] by singing the East L.A. streets [[Soto Street]], [[Cesar Chavez Avenue|Brooklyn Avenue]], [[City Terrace]], and [[Whittier Boulevard]].

[[Dirty Vegas]] filmed their music video for their song &quot;[[Days Go By (Dirty Vegas song)|Days Go By]]&quot; on the sidewalk in front of Chroni's Famous Sandwich Shop in East L.A.  In the video, a man dances in front of Chroni's, supposedly year after year, in an effort to win his ex-girlfriend back into his life.  Chroni's, along with other East L.A. landmarks, is also mentioned in [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]]'s novel, [[The Revolt of the Cockroach People]].  

The area is also referenced in the [[MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e]] song Wildside.

East L.A. is mentioned in the song [[Maria Maria]] by [[Carlos Santana]].

East L.A. is mentioned in the song &quot;Americano&quot; by [[Lady Gaga]].
