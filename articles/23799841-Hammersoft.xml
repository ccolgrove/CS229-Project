'''Channel Awesome''' is an online media production company based in [[Naperville, Illinois]].  The company was created in 2008 by '''Mike Michaud''' ([[Chief executive officer]]), '''Mike Ellis''' (former [[Chief operating officer]]) and '''Bhargav Dronamraju''' ([[Executive producer|Chief executive producer]]).  Channel Awesome currently operates the ''[[That Guy with the Glasses]]'' website,  joined by ''Bar Fiesta'' in November 2009, and ''Blistered Thumbs'' in November 2010. All of Channel Awesome's content is hosted by [[Blip.tv]].  The company is believed to have earned $150,000 in 2009, the majority of which came from advertising through their site and web series. '''Robert Walker''', brother of '''Douglas Walker''' (That Guy with the Glasses), is the company's Creative Content Officer in charge of recruiting talent for the website.

==History==
Mike Michaud created Channel Awesome with two others after they were laid off from [[Circuit City (1949â2009 company)|Circuit City]] in 2007.  The three discussed the idea of such a company while still employed, but their dismissal was the impetus to put their plans into action. Michaud has stated that &quot;If we didn't lose our jobs, [the business] wouldn't have happened anytime soon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune060709&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Meyer |authorlink= |title=Growing breed of accidental entrepreneur has recession to thank for business creation |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-07-06/news/0907050116_1_kauffman-foundation-entrepreneurship-older-entrepreneurs |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt;

The company's first website is ''[[That Guy with the Glasses]]'' based on the characters created by Douglas Walker.  Walker had previously hosted these through [[YouTube]], but they were repeatedly removed under suspicion of copyright infringement.  The site was launched in April 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;suntimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Brad |last=Spirrison |authorlink= |title=Entertainers don't need TV break to hit it big |url=http://www.chicagolandec.org/pdf/CST_BradsMayorArticleFF.pdf |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was also featured in [[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur magazine]] on December 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;entrepreneur magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Daley |authorlink=|title=The Entrepreneur Economy |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneur/2009/december/204086.html |work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur Magazine]] |date=December 2009|accessdate=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the history of the site was discussed as well as the plans for the future. The site later expanded to feature content from various other contributors.

Douglas Walker's ''The Nostalgia Critic'' show averages about 600,000 viewers per week and the ''That Guy with the Glasses'' site as a whole receives 18.5&amp;nbsp;million page views per month.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune060709&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suntimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jefferson |last=Graham |authorlink=Jefferson Graham |title=Blip.tv gives videomakers a chance to be a star |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2009-02-10-blip-tv-videomakers_N.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=February 13, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected to increase following content-provider Blip.tv's deal with YouTube in July 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;adage&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Learmonth |authorlink= |title=Blip.tv Brings Programs to YouTube, Ads to 'Channel Awesome' |url=http://adage.com/digital/article?article_id=138164 |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=July 28, 2009 |accessdate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site earns more than $10,000 per month in advertising revenue and has received over $11,000 in online donations from viewers. The company expects to earn $150,000 by the end of the year. In the third quarter of the 2009 [[Fiscal year]], Walker's shows earned $53,000. This revenue was generated by [[run of network]] from Puma and [[Starburst (confectionery)|Starburst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune060709&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;suntimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;adage&quot; /&gt; As of June 2011, the company employs seven full time staff.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian|last=Stelter|authorlink= |title=Online Video Start-Ups Seek to Carve Out a Place Beside YouTube|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/business/media/06blip.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=B1|date=June 5, 2011 |accessdate=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production costs of Channel Awesome's web series are minimal, requiring just a camera, software and the stars of the shows themselves.  According to Walker, &quot;these people are cheap to get because we are happy to see any amount of money.&quot;  Channel Awesome's ability to attract a significant audience with such low expenditure is having an effect on video entertainment production.&lt;ref name=&quot;suntimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;adage&quot; /&gt;

On December 5, 2009, the company held a donation drive for the [[Ronald McDonald House]] charity. The donation drive lasted on the upwards of seven hours and raised $26,400.  During the event, calls were taken, prizes were awarded to people who donated large sums of money and videos featuring the talent on the site were aired. The donation drive was extended a few more days making the grand total $32,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charity Aftermath |url=http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/video-updates/14565-ncud20091210 |date=December 10, 2009 |work= That Guy With The Glasses |accessdate=December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Charity You Made Possible! |url=http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/specials/15127-rmhc01 |date=December 24, 2009 |work=That Guy With The Glasses |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=That Guy With The Glasses-Ronald McDonald House Charities of Chicagoland &amp; Northwest Indiana |url=http://www.rmhccni.org/spotlight/That-Guy-With-The-Glasses |date=December 2009 |work= Ronald McDonald House Charities| accessdate= December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drive itself was also archived on ThatGuyWithTheGlasses for all to see.

Channel Awesome has plans to build on the success of ''That Guy with the Glasses'' with a network of new websites including ''Bar Fiesta'' (covering Chicago entertainment and nightlife) and ''Inked Reality'' for anime and comic books. ''Blistered Thumbs'' (a spin off incorporating the current site's videogame content) was launched November 4, 2010 as the beginning of the new Channel Awesome network. Mike Michaud told the [[Chicago Sun-Times]] that he has 300 new show ideas in the works, intends to discover more performers like Walker, and has plans to increase revenue through sponsorship and merchandising.&lt;ref name=&quot;suntimes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Status of the Site 6/5/09 |url=http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/site-news/general-updates/7914-sots60509 |date=June 5, 2009 |work=That Guy With The Glasses |accessdate=July 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 Michaud is looking for warehouse space in suburban Chicago.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

In 2011, Michaud told the [[The New York Times]], &quot;My company has a lot of growing up to do, but I believe that sometime in the next one to two years someone will create that one series that gets everyone talking... [and attract audiences] to the endless options of online video.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt;
