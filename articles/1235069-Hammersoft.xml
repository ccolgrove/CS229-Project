'''David Bellion''' (born 27 November 1982 in [[Paris]]) is a [[French people|French]] [[Association football|football]]er who currently plays for [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux]]. He is of [[Senegal]]ese origin.

==Club career==
===Cannes===
Bellion started his career at [[AS Cannes|Cannes]] at the age of 14, and earned a move to English side [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the summer of 2001. In his youth he was a talented athlete, competing in the 2001 National Indoor Youth Championships he won the 60 metres.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2007/20070807_141337Dev.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sunderland===
He made his [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] senior debut at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in August 2001, coming on as a substitute. The Frenchman's first senior goal was against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] at the [[Stadium of Light]] which gave [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] a 1â0 win in September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2272638.stm|title=Sunderland edge to victory|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=28 September 2002 |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the goal, Bellion found himself a first team regular at Sunderland, although was unable to save them from [[Promotion and relegation|relegation]] with the third-lowest [[Premier League]] points tally ever. Towards the end of the season, Bellion attracted interest from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], and angered many fans by going [[desertion|AWOL]] to France at a time when the Black Cats needed him most. Upon returning, Bellion claimed he had been visiting his sick grandmother, and made himself temporarily unavailable for selection, claiming he was &quot;mentally unfit&quot; to be playing in a relegation battle. At the time, speculation was rife that Bellion had been &quot;tapped up&quot; by United, although Manchester United and Bellion's [[Sports agent|agent]] firmly denied this. Despite this, Bellion agreed a move to the &quot;Red Devils&quot; after his contract expired in June 2003, although the transfer was not without controversy. As Bellion was under the age of 23, Sunderland were eligible for compensation, and a fee of Â£2&amp;nbsp;million, rising to Â£3&amp;nbsp;million depending on appearances, was agreed out of court. The fee was agreed on the basis that Sunderland chairman [[Bob Murray (businessman)|Bob Murray]] signed a &quot;confidentiality agreement&quot; and did not launch a complaint against Manchester United over the alleged &quot;tapping up&quot; of Bellion, after former [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] vice-chairman [[David Dein]] claimed Bellion had been offered to Arsenal by his agent illegally,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} and that United had been paying for Bellion's mobile phone bills whilst still at Sunderland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Manchester United===
Bellion moved to [[Old Trafford]] in August 2003 and scored on his debut against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] on the club's pre-season American tour. His first competitive goal came at [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Leeds 2â3 Man Utd
|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] 
|date=28 October 2003 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the striker scored two goals in the [[2003â04 in English football|2003â04]] season â against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=20 March 2004 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; both at Old Trafford.

Despite a smattering of early-season goals against Norwich City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Man Utd 2â1 Norwich

|title=Bolton 2â2 Man Utd
|publisher=[[BBC Sport]] 
|date=11 September 2004 |accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2004â05 in English football|2004â05]] campaign proved equally frustrating for Bellion as he found himself increasingly frozen out of the first team picture. A fruitful spell in the Reserves followed, but Bellion's season was curtailed in early May when he suffered a fractured fibula against Charlton Reserves.  Bellion spent time on loan at [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] at the beginning of the [[2005â06 in English football|2005â06]] season, returning to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for the first time as an unused substitute for the Hammers in October 2005, where he was booed whilst warming up. He scored on his debut, a [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] win over [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] on 20 September 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[[BBC]] 
|date=20 September 2005 |accessdate=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to make ten appearances for the club, mostly as [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]].

===Nice===
He returned to France on 9 January 2006, joining Nice, a loan until the end of the season that was made a permanent move in June 2006.

===Bordeaux===
Bellion joined [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] on 15 July 2007, signing a four-year deal. He marked his first match by scoring the only goal in Bordeaux's 1â0 win over [[RC Lens|Lens]].

===Nice===
In December 2010, Bellion returned to [[OGC Nice|Nice]] on loan until the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ogcnice.com/actualite/news.php?clef=6697 |title=Accord pour le prÃªt de Bellion }}&lt;/ref&gt;
