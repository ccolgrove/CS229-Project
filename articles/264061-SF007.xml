'''William &quot;Bill&quot; Maher, Jr.'''  ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|m|ÉË|r}}; born January 20, 1956) is an American [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], television host, [[pundit (expert)|political commentator]], author and actor.

Maher is known for his [[political satire]] and [[sociopolitical]] commentary, which targets a wide swath of topics: [[religion]], politics, [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] of many kinds, [[political correctness]], the [[mass media]], greed among people and persons in positions of high political and social power, the lack of intellectual curiosity of the electorate, among many topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Early career==

Since beginning his career as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and [[actor]], he occasionally acts and tours. He was host of the [[New York City]] [[comedy club]] [[Catch a Rising Star]] in 1979. Thanks to [[Steve Allen]], he began appearing on [[Johnny Carson]]'s and [[David Letterman]]'s shows in 1982. He made limited television appearances including a recurring role in ''[[Sara (US TV series)|Sara]]'' (1985), appeared in ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]'' (1987), two separate appearances on ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' (1989, 1990), a recurring role in ''[[Charlie Hoover]]'' (1991) and other productions.

==Television career==

===''Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher''===

{{Main|Politically Incorrect}}

Maher assumed the host role ''[[Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]]'', a late-night political [[talk show]] that ran on [[Comedy Central]] from 1993â1997 and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1997â2002. The show regularly began with a topical [[monologue]] by Maher preceding the introduction of four guests, usually a diverse group of individuals from [[show business]], [[popular culture]], political [[pundits]], [[political]] [[consultants]], [[authors]], and occasionally news figures. The group would discuss topical issues selected by Maher, who also participated in the  discussions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

''Politically Incorrect'' won an array of awards, including an [[Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Technical Direction, two [[CableACE]] awards for Best Talk Show Series, and a [[Genesis Award]] for Best Television Talk Show. Maher earned numerous award nominations for his producing, writing and hosting of ''Politically Incorrect'', including ten [[Emmy]] nominations, two [[TV Guide]] nominations, and two [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] nominations.  ABC decided against renewing Maher's contract for ''Politically Incorrect'' in 2002, after he made a [[controversial]] [[Broadcasting|on-air]] remark shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebigstory.org/ov/ov-politicallyincorrect.html |title=The Big Story: Politically Incorrect |accessdate=June 19, 2007 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He agreed with his guest, [[conservative]] [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] [[Dinesh D'Souza]], that the 9/11 terrorists did not act in a cowardly manner (in rebuttal to President Bush's statement calling 9/11 hijackers cowards). Maher said, &quot;We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from two thousand miles away. That's cowardly. Staying in the airplane when it hits the building. Say what you want about it. Not cowardly. You're right.&quot; Maher later clarified that his comment was not anti-military in any way whatsoever, referencing his well-documented longstanding support for the American military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goldberg |first=Danny |authorlink= |title=It's a Free Country: Personal Freedom in America After September&amp;nbsp;11 |publisher=[[RDV Books]] |year=2002 |page=77 |isbn=0971920605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Garofoli |first=Joe |title=Talk host's towering rant: S.F. not worth saving |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/11/11/MNGFMFMNV41.DTL |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |last=Navasky |first=Victor |title= Profiles in Cowardice |url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011105/navasky |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |publisher=[[The Nation]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the attacks, some corporate advertisers found the comment too insensitive and controversial. Several companies, including [[FedEx]] and [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]], pulled their [[Advertising|advertisement]]s from the show, costing the show more than it returned.

The show was cancelled on June 16, 2002, and the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]] had dropped the show from its [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-[[Network affiliate|affiliated]] stations months prior. On June 22, 2002, just six days after the cancellation of ''Politically Incorrect'', Maher received the [[Los Angeles]] Press Club president's award (for &quot;championing [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]&quot;). Maher was on the board of judges one year for the [[PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award]].

Maher's remarks after 9/11 were not the first time he had sparked controversy on ''Politically Incorrect''. In the same year, Maher was widely criticized for comparing dogs to retarded children.  He apologized for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9D06E6DA1F3DF93BA25752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=TV Host's Words Draw Criticism and Apology | date=January 18, 2001 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Real Time with Bill Maher''===

{{Main|Real Time with Bill Maher}}

In 2003, Maher became the host, co-producer and co-writer of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', a weekly hour-long political comedy [[talk show]] on the [[cable television]] network [[HBO]]. During an interview, Maher told [[Terry Gross]] (on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'') that he much prefers having serious and well-informed guests on his program, as opposed to the random [[celebrities]] that fleshed out his roundtable discussions on ''Politically Incorrect''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4490632 | work=NPR | title=Bill Maher: Four More Years | date=February 8, 2005 | accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with his previous show, ''Politically Incorrect'', Maher begins ''Real Time'' with a comic opening monologue based upon [[current events]] and other topical issues. He proceeds to a one-on-one interview with a guest, either in-studio or via [[satellite]]. Following the interview, Maher sits with three panelists, usually consisting of [[pundits]], [[authors]], [[activists]] and [[journalists]], for a discussion of the week's events. In the segment &quot;New Rules&quot; at the end of each show, Maher delivers a humorous editorial on [[popular culture]] and [[American politics]].

In late May 2005, [[Alabama]] Congressman [[Spencer Bachus]] sent a letter to [[Time Warner]]'s board of directors requesting ''Real Time'' be cancelled after remarks Maher made after noting the military had missed its recruiting goals by 42 percent. Bachus said he felt the comments were demeaning to the military and treasonous.  Maher stated his highest regard and support for the troops and asked why the congressman criticized him instead of doing something about the recruitment problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,157435,00.html |title=Bill Maher's Remark About Army 'Borders on Treason,' Lawmaker Says â Celebrity Gossip &amp;#124; Entertainment News &amp;#124; Arts And Entertainment |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=May 23, 2005 |accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Real Time'' has earned widespread praise. It has been nominated for more than ten [[Primetime]] [[Emmy Awards]] and six [[Writers Guild of America|Writer's Guild]] awards. In 2007, Maher and his co-producers were awarded the Television Producer of the Year Award in Variety Television. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In early 2006, ''Real Time'' was released as an audio CD, along with another CD entitled ''Bill Maher's New Rules'' which features clips, segments and teasers from Real Time. Starting with Episode 67 (2-23-06), ''Real Time'' became available in the USA on [[iTunes]] as a free weekly audio [[podcast]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Maher holds the record for the most Emmy nominations without a win, having been nominated on 22 occasions and not winning once. Eleven of the nominations were for ''Politically Incorrect'', while nine were for ''Real Time.'' The other two were nominations for two of his HBO comedy specials: ''Bill Maher: I'm Swiss'' and ''Bill Maher: The Decider.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/07/will-emmys-biggest-loser-bill-maher-ever-win.html | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Gold Derby | date=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HBO announced in July 2011 the show was renewed for a tenth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=LA Times |date=July 28, 2011 |title=TCA 2011: HBO to get 'Luck'-y in January |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/07/tca-2011-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher favors a partial privatization of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], ending [[corporate welfare]] and federal funding of [[Non-profit organization|non-profits]], and legalization of [[gambling]], [[prostitution]], and marijuana.  Maher is a member of [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws|NORML]]'s Advisory Board, an organization which supports regulated legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. He describes himself as an [[environmentalist]], and he has spoken in favor of the [[Kyoto treaty]] on [[global warming]] on his show ''Real Time''. He often criticizes industry figures involved in environmental pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;halem2001&quot;&gt;Halem, Dann. (August 1, 2001.)

Maher is a board member of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]]. He has expressed his distaste for the [[Pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] and [[health care]] industries in general, on the grounds that they make their money out of curing people who are made sick by consuming [[junk food|unhealthy food]] that corporations urge upon the public. He maintains that mass consumption of [[high-fructose corn syrup]] is a contributor to the rise in frequency of [[obesity]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0409/13/lkl.00.html Larry King Live â Interview With Bill Maher]; CNN; September 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]], Maher became candid in his stated opposition to the re-election of [[George W. Bush]] and in his support for [[John Kerry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/02/us/convictions-intact-nader-soldiers-on.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Maher%202000%20Bush&amp;st=cse&quot; | work=The New York Times | title=Convictions Intact, Nader Soldiers On | first=Katharine Q. | last=Seelye | date=August 2, 2004 | accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known for protesting against the demonization of the word &quot;liberal&quot;, during the campaign Maher criticized Kerry for being ashamed of the word. On his show, the comedian has noted the paradox of people claiming they distrusted &quot;elite&quot; politicians while at the same time wanting elite doctors to treat them and elite lawyers to represent them in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2007/04/13/pat_robertson &quot;Say it loud: I'm elite and proud!&quot;] Salon; April 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Maher supports the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], the legality of [[abortion]] and [[euthanasia]].

He is skeptical of Iraq surviving without civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Modell |first=Josh |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/bill-maher,14307/ |title=Bill Maher &amp;#124; Film &amp;#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V.

In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], Maher announced his support for [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/20080204_down_to_the_wire/ |title=Ear to the Ground â Down to the Wire |publisher=Truthdig |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Maher welcomed Obama's electoral victory, he has subjected him to criticism once in office for not acting boldly on health care reform and other progressive issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/15/bill-maher-tells-olberman_n_215964.html | work=Huffington post | title=Bill Maher Tells Olbermann Why He's Criticizing Obama | date=June 15, 2009 | accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{See also|Religulous}}
Maher is highly critical of [[religion]], and views it as not worth the bother.  He has referred to himself as an [[Apatheism|apatheist]], instead of an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] or [[atheist]], on ''[[Scarborough Country]]'' on April 24, 2007, and again in July of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/videos/932-bill-maher-apatheist &quot;Bill Maher â APATHEIST&quot;], The Richard Dawkins Foundation, April 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/07/12/maher-on-religion/&quot;], CNN Belief Blogs, July 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He has reiterated this stance in subsequent interviews, rejecting both the certitude of the existence, as well as the certitude of nonexistence of deities, concluding, &quot;I'm saying that doubt is the only appropriate response for human beings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article6010432.ece &quot;Bill Maher: The God Botherer&quot;]; The Sunday Times; April 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  He is an advisory board member of author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]]'s [[The Reason Project]], a foundation that promotes scientific knowledge and secular values within society.

Maher and director [[Larry Charles]] teamed up to make the feature film ''[[Religulous]]'' (2008), described by trade publication ''Variety'' as a documentary &quot;that spoofs religious extremism across the world.&quot; It was released on October 3, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

While Maher is critcal towards Christianity, he is an outspoken critic of religion as a whole, including Islam.  On October 29, 2010, during a Real Time segment, Maher commented on a news story saying that the name Mohammed had become the most popular baby name in the United Kingdom.  He asked, &quot;Am I a racist to feel alarmed by that?  Because I am. And itâs not because of the race, itâs because of the religion. I donât have to apologize, do I, for not wanting the Western world to be taken over by Islam in 300 years? Sharia law is being institutionalized in England? Well, then I am right, I should be alarmed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/11/01/bill_maher_on_muslims|title=Bill Maher to Muslims: Go away|publisher = [[Salon.com]]|date = October 29, 2010|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later defended his comments on [[CNN]], saying, &quot;And when I say Westerner, I mean someone who believes in the values that Western people believe in that a lot of the Muslim world does not. Like separation of church and state. Like equality of the sexes. Like respect for minorities, free elections, free speech, freedom to gather. These things are not just different from cultures that donât have them. â¦ Itâs better. â¦ I would like to keep those values here.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/bill-maher-stands-by-mohammed-remarks-i-dont-need-to-apologize-for-being-a-proud-westerner/|title=Bill Maher Stands By Mohammed Remarks: âI Donât Need To Apologize For Being A Proud Westernerâ|publisher = Mediaite.com |date = November 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher received the [[Richard Dawkins Award]] for 2009 from [[Atheist Alliance International]] &quot;for his efforts to further the values science and reason in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atheistalliance.org/news-a-articles/aai-news/31-aai-announces-site-of-2009-convention AAI Announces Site of 2009 Convention]; AAI Organization; May 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care===
Maher has stated that the [[American Medical Association|AMA]] is a powerful lobbying group and one of the primary reasons why the United States had failed to enact health care reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube.com&quot;&gt;(2009-06-15). [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJ2L1aQy-io Keith Olbermann: Bill Maher Talks About Taking On Obama]. Countdown With Keith Olbermann. Retrieved June 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/31387052/ns/msnbc_tv-countdown_with_keith_olbermann/ Countdown With Keith Olbermann]; MSNBC; June 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2009, Maher was a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' and on the topic of getting universal health care legislation passed, Maher stated that Obama should forget about trying to get 60 votes for it, &quot;he only needs 51.&quot; &quot;Forget getting the sixty votes or sixty percent â sixty percent of people don't believe in evolution in this country â he just needs to drag them to it, like I said, they're stupid; get health care done, with or without them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonightshowwithconanobrien.com/video/clips/bill-maher-pt2-082409/1149697/ |title='&amp;#39;Tonight Show'&amp;#39; with Conan O'Brien |publisher=Tonightshowwithconanobrien.com |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher has expressed the view that most illness is generally the result of poor diet and that medicine is often not the best way of addressing illness. In an episode of the show about the 2008 presidential candidates' health plans, Maher stated that poor nutrition is the primary cause of illness, and that &quot;the answer isn't another pill.&quot;

In a discussion with Michael Moore about the film ''[[Sicko]]'', Maher asks, &quot;The human body is pretty amazing; it doesn't get sick, usually, for no reason. I mean, there's some genetic stuff that can get to you, but, basically, people are sick in this country because they're poisoned. The environment is a poisoning factor, but also, we gotta say, they poison themselves. They eat shit. People eat shit, and that's, to my way of thinking, about 90 percent of why people are sick, is because they eat shit. Would you agree?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kerry-trueman/maher-and-moore-chew-out-_b_50004.html Maher and Moore Chew (Out) the Fat]; Kerry Trueman, ''The Huffington Post''; May 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2009, on his HBO show, Maher debated the effectiveness of flu vaccinations with [[Bill Frist]] and stated, &quot;Why would you let them be the ones to stick a disease into your arm? I would never get a swine flu vaccine or any vaccine. I donât trust the government, especially with my health.&quot;  Maher also expressed skepticism about the seriousness of the swine flu and whether completely healthy people could die from it.  His comments have generated criticism, and his remarks have been called unscientific and even harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/bill-maher-vs-the-flu-vaccine/ | work=The New York Times | first=Tara | last=Parker-Pope | date=October 13, 2009 | accessdate=April 1, 2010 | title=Bill Maher vs. the Flu Vaccine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher responded to the criticism, noting, &quot;What I've read about what they think I'm saying is not what I've said. I'm not a germ theory denier. I believe vaccinations can work. Polio is a good example. Do I think in certain situations that inoculating Third World children against malaria or diphtheria, or whatever, is right? Of course. In a situation like that, the benefits outweigh costs. But to me living in Los Angeles? To get a flu shot? No.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegsun.com/entertainment/tv/2009/10/28/11548266-sun.html Needling Bill Maher]; Winnipeg Sun; October 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Vaccine controversy]])

===Criticism of 9/11 conspiracy theories===
Maher has been a critic of [[9/11 conspiracy theories]]. On October 19, 2007, Maher confronted several [[9/11 truth movement|9/11 truthers]] and had them ejected from his show audience after they interrupted the live show numerous times by calling out from the audience.  The incident drew significant media attention and praise from Fox News talk show host and frequent critic [[John Gibson (political commentator)|John Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,304240,00.html|title = Hat's Off to Bill Maher|date = October 22, 2007|accessdate = January 17, 2008|publisher = Fox News Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Maher has never married. In 2003, he began dating former [[Playboy Cyber Girl]] Coco Johnsen. In November 2004, at the end of their 17-month relationship, she sued him for [[United States dollar|USD]] $9 million for &quot;pain and suffering&quot; for alleged &quot;insulting, humiliating and degrading racial comments.&quot; Her suit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1111041coco1.html|title=Bill Maher Hit With Palimony Suit|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that Maher promised to marry her and father her children, support her financially, and purchase a Beverly Hills home. Her suit also alleged that she quit her job as a flight attendant and occasional model to be with him. Maher's lawyers in their response filed on November 23, 2004, in Los Angeles Superior Court said Maher is a &quot;confirmed bachelor, and a very public one at that&quot; who &quot;never promised to marry [Johnsen] or to have children with her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/12-1-2004-62384.asp|title=Bill Maher Fights Back|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maher's filing stated that &quot;When the dating ended, [Johnson] (sic) launched a campaign to embarrass, humiliate, and extort ridiculous sums of money from Bill Maher.&quot; Johnsen accused another former boyfriend of rape and kidnapping in 1997, and the charges were later dismissed for lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/399/000022333/|title=Bill Maher|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her lawsuit against Maher was dismissed on May 2, 2005.

[[File:BillMaherStarSept10.jpg|thumb|right|Maher next to his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in September 2010]]
Maher enjoys his bachelor status and states that he does not want to get married. On his website, he is quoted as saying, &quot;I'm the last of my guy friends to have never gotten married, and their wives â they don't want them playing with me. I'm like the escaped slave â I bring news of freedom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billmaher.com/|title=About Bill Maher|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he began dating [[Karrine Steffans]], best-selling author  and former [[hip hop model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allreaders.com/topics/Info_35499.asp|title=Plot Summary of Confessions of A Video Vixen|last=Calhoune|first=Sandra |accessdate=January 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;savvy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savvyinsider.com/article.php?op=viewArticle&amp;article_ID=305|title=Bill Maher&amp;nbsp;â Smart, Snide, Still Single|accessdate=January 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/28/AR2005072802242.html A Bawdy Lifestyle, and How to Shake It] Washington Post; July 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; When commentators suggested there was a pattern to his dating because both his girlfriend and former girlfriend were [[African American|black]], Maher said, &quot;People say I'm into black women. [[Robert De Niro]] is into black women. I'm just into women who are real, and they happen to be black.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;savvy&quot; /&gt;
