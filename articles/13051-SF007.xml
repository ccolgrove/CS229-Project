'''Gnumeric''' is a [[spreadsheet]] program that is part of the [[GNOME]] Free Software Desktop Project. Gnumeric version 1.0 was released December 31, 2001. Gnumeric is distributed as [[free software]] under the [[GNU GPL]] license; it is intended to replace [[proprietary software|proprietary]] and other spreadsheet programs such as [[Microsoft Excel]], which it broadly and openly emulates.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Gnumeric was created and developed by [[Miguel de Icaza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/software/gnumeric/gnumeric.html | title = The Gnumeric spreadsheet | author = Gnumeric authors | accessdate = 2010-09-06 | quote = ''Gnumeric has been coded mainly by Miguel de Icaza, with help from other intrepid hackers that have contributed code, bug fixes and documentation.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he has since moved on to other projects. The current maintainer is [[Jody Goldberg]].

Gnumeric has the ability to import and export data in several file formats, including [[Comma-separated values|CSV]], Microsoft Excel (write support for the more recent .xlsx format is incomplete&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/doc/sect-file-formats.shtml Gnumeric v1.10 manual, file formats]&lt;/ref&gt;), [[HTML]], [[LaTeX]], [[Lotus 1-2-3]], [[OpenDocument]] and [[Quattro Pro]]; its native format is the ''Gnumeric file format'' (.gnm or .gnumeric), an [[XML]] file compressed with [[gzip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.gnome.org/gnumeric/doc/file-format-gnumeric.shtml|title=''Gnumeric'' XML File Format|date=November 2007|work=The Gnumeric Manual, version 1.8|publisher=GNOME Documentation Project|accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes all of the [[Subroutine|spreadsheet function]]s of the [[North America]]n edition of [[Microsoft Excel]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and many functions unique to Gnumeric. [[Pivot table]]s are not yet supported.

Gnumeric's accuracy has helped it to establish a niche for [[statistical analysis]] and other [[scientific]] tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csdassn.org/software_reports/gnumeric.pdf|title=Fixing Statistical Errors in Spreadsheet Software: The Cases of Gnumeric and Excel|last=McCullough|first=B. D.|date=2004-06-04|work=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis|accessdate=31 January 2010|quote=The most recent versions given a full analysis in this report (available without charge) are Microsoft Excel XP and Gnumeric 1.1.2, and the author has more-limited data on then-new Excel 2003.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCullough|first=B. D.|coauthors=Wilson, Berry|date=15 June 2005|title=On the accuracy of statistical procedures in Microsoft Excel 2003|journal=Computational Statistics &amp; Data Analysis |volume=49|issue=4|pages=1244â1252|issn=0167-9473|url=http://arc.nucapt.northwestern.edu/~karnesky/sdarticle.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2010|quote=In this journal article, after a more complete analysis of Excel 2003, McCullough concludes that Excel 2003 is an improvement over previous versions, but not enough has been done that its use for statistical purposes can be recommended}}&lt;/ref&gt; For improving the accuracy of Gnumeric, the developers are cooperating with the [[R programming language|R Project]].

Gnumeric has a different interface for the creation and editing of graphs than other spreadsheet software. For editing a graph, Gnumeric displays a window where all the elements of the graph are listed. Other spreadsheet programs typically require the user to select the individual elements of the graph in the graph itself in order to edit them.
