'''''Three Forty Three''''' is a ''RAnger 4200'' Class [[Robert Allan Ltd.]] designed [[fireboat]] built to replace the ''[[John D. McKean (fireboat)|John D. McKean]]'' to serve the [[New York City Fire Department]] as Marine Company 1.&lt;ref&gt;http://marine1fdny.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  It was placed into service at 0900 on September 11, 2010, nine years after the terrorist attacks.

==Namesake==
The boat's name comes from the number of [[FDNY]] members killed in the line of duty on [[September 11th, 2001]].  For days following the terrorist attack the only water available to the area was provided by the FDNYâs Marine Units.

==Manufacturing==
The ''Three Forty Three'' was built by [[Eastern Shipbuilding Group]] of [[Panama City, Florida]] and is the largest single purpose fireboat built to date with the highest pumping capacity of any fireboat ever built. A sister vessel named ''[[Fire Fighter II]]'' was delivered and placed in service with Marine 9 in November 2010 to replace the 70 year old ''[[Fire Fighter (fireboat)|Fire Fighter]]'', which is listed on the National Register of Historical Places.

==Features==
The 140-foot, 500-ton, $27 million dollar fast response boat is the countryâs largest fireboat, with a maximum speed of 18 knots. The ''Three Forty Three'' incorporates the latest technology available for marine vessels, including the capability of pumping 50,000 gallons of water per minute, nearly 30,000 gallons more than its predecessor. It has an operating crew of seven.
