'''PortableApps.com''' is a site offering [[portable application|portable]] [[application software|software]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portableapps.com/news/2009-07-28_-_portableapps.com_hits_100_million_portable_apps_downloaded |title=PortableApps.com Hits 100 Million Portable Apps Downloaded|publisher=PortableApps.com |accessdate=2009-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The site was founded by John T. Haller and includes contributions from over 100 people, including developers, designers and translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portableapps.com/about/team |title=Our Team |publisher=PortableApps.com |accessdate=2011-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The site and project started out of a portable version of [[Mozilla Firefox, Portable Edition|Mozilla Firefox]]&lt;ref&gt;http://portableapps.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; in March of 2004. John T. Haller then expanded the project to include [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and [[OpenOffice.org]].  Soon the [[open source]] suite of programs outgrew Haller's personal website and Haller moved it to a community site, PortableApps.com. The site currently hosts various projects created by forum members. The site is also used for [[Software bug|bug]] reporting and suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portableapps.com/node/11606 |title=PortableApps.com Update (Week of Feb 18, 2007) |publisher=PortableApps.com |accessdate=2008-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compatibility==
The majority of applications can run on most computers with [[Windows 2000]] or later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portableapps.com/apps/compatibility |title=PortableApps.com OS Compatibility List |publisher= PortableApps.com |accessdate=2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most apps will also run under [[Wine (software)|Wine]] on [[Linux]]-based operating systems. Older versions of many apps support Windows 95/98/Me, but no new releases support these systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portableapps.com/news/2010-04-27_-_ending_windows_95-98-me_support |title=Ending Windows 95/98/Me Support |publisher=PortableApps.com |accessdate=2010-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Application installers designed for use with the PortableApps.com menu follow the convention of using filenames ending in a &quot;.paf.exe&quot; extension, include [[HTML]] documentation and store data in the Data directory, allowing for simple backup of data with the PortableApps.com Backup utility. Installers intended for use with the PortableApps.com menu should be [[Nullsoft Scriptable Install System|NSIS]] installers, generated with the PortableApps.com Installer, but can be compressed archives with self extractors, or any installer executable.

==PortableApps.com Launcher==
The PortableApps.com Launcher is used to make applications portable by handling path redirection, environment variable changes, file and directory movement, configuration file path updates and similar changes, as configured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portableapps.com/apps/development/portableapps.com_launcher |title=PortableApps.com Launcher| accessdate=2010-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PortableApps.com Launcher allows software to be made portable without the need to write custom code or make changes to the base application. While some of the software packages released on PortableApps.com currently still contain their own custom launchers, the PortableApps.com Launcher is used in all new apps released.

==List of bundled applications in the PortableApps.com Suite==
The Suite Light (150 [[Megabyte|MB]]) and Suite Standard (400 MB) are packages containing the PortableApps.com Platform and certain popular apps for various tasks. The Platform by itself does not have any bundled applications, permitting users to only install what they want more easily.
