'''Harlon Henry Block''' (November 6, 1924 â March 1, 1945) was a [[United States Marine]] during [[World War II]].  Born in [[Texas]], Block joined the Marine Corps in November 1943 and subsequently saw action during the [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Battle of Bougainville]] and the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] where he was killed in action.  He is best known as one of the six men photographed [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|raising the flag on Iwo Jima]].

==Early life==
Block was born in [[Yorktown, Texas]], the third of six children to Edward Frederick Block and Ada Belle Brantley, a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh day-Adventist]] family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/BB/fbl52.html Biograph] from the Handbook of Texas Online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marines.mil/unit/mcbhawaii/Pages/2005/Famed%20Iwo%20Jima%20flag%20raisers%20gone%20but%20not%20forgotten.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The Block children were: Edward, Jr., Maurine, Harlon, Larry, Corky, and Melford.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Frederick Block was a [[World War I]] veteran and supported his family by working as a dairy farmer.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'' by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]], p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

In hopes of improving the family, the Block family relocated to [[Weslaco, Texas]], a small town located in the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. His father became a dairy farmer, and the children attended a Seventh-day Adventist private school. Harlon Block was expelled in his freshman year when he refused to tell the principal which student had vandalised the school. Block then transferred to [[Weslaco High School]] in Weslaco, and was remembered as an outgoing student with many friends. A natural athlete, Block led the Weslaco Panther Football Team to the Conference Championship. He was honored as &quot;All South Texas End.&quot;

==Military service==
Block and twelve of his teammates enlisted in the Marine Corps through the [[Selective Service System]] at [[San Antonio]] on February 18, 1943.  After basic training in [[San Diego]], he took [[parachute]] training and qualifying as a [[Paramarine]], and was promoted to [[Private First Class]] on May 22, 1943.

He was served in the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific Theatre]], and arrived at [[New Caledonia]] on November 15, 1943, where he participated with the Headquarters and Service Company of the [[1st Marine Parachute Regiment]], [[I Marine Amphibious Corps]].  He served in the [[Bougainville Campaign]] after landing there on December 21.  He returned to San Diego, due to the Marine Parachute Regiment disbanding on February 29, 1944.  He joined Company E, [[2nd Battalion, 28th Marines]], [[5th Marine Division]] at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]], and was promoted Corporal on October 27, 1944.

==The Battle of Iwo Jima==
Block landed on [[Iwo Jima]] on February 19, 1945, and was involved in the second flag-raising on [[Mount Suribachi]] on February 23, 1945.  As a corporal, he was second-in-command of his squad to Sergeant [[Michael Strank]] at Iwo Jima. He idolized Strank, and as written in the book ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', followed Strank without question. Block assumed leadership of his squad when Sergeant Strank was killed.  Block was also killed by a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] blast just hours later on the same day, March 1, as the squad attacked toward Nishi Ridge. &quot;They killed me!&quot; were his last words.

*[[Purple Heart]] (awarded posthumously);
*[[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] with one star (for Iwo Jima),
*[[American Campaign Medal]]
*[[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]] with two stars (for the Consolidation of the Northern Solomons and [[Iwo Jima]]),
*[[World War II Victory Medal]].

==Flag raising controversy==
[[File:Raising the Flag outline.png|thumb|left|A photo to show all six men]]
In the battle aftermath, controversy arose as to the identity of the Marine who planted the flag in the famous photograph of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima.  When his mother first viewed [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s iconic flag raising photograph in the Weslaco newspaper on February 25, just two days after the photo was taken, she immediately exclaimed, &quot;That's Harlon&quot;, pointing to the figure on the far right.  However, [[Rene Gagnon]] mistakenly identified the figure as Sergeant [[Hank Hansen]] of [[Boston]], another Paramarine who was involved in the first flag-raising earlier that day, but who was not included in the famous photograph.  [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]] concurred with Gagnon at that time.

Block's mother never wavered in her belief that it was Harlon insisting, &quot;I know my boy&quot;, yet no one believed her.  Some eighteen months later, a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] investigation revealed that it was indeed Block and not Hansen in the photograph.  Fellow Paramarine [[Ira Hayes]] was instrumental in proving Block's involvement in the famous photograph, and in the end, both Gagnon and Bradley agreed that &quot;it could be Block.&quot;  In fact, Hayes had told Marine officials that the sixth flag raiser was Block, but since the Marines had already made announcements that Hansen had been identified, he was told not to make waves.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bradley (author)|Bradley, James]].  ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]''. p.417&lt;/ref&gt;

Block was originally buried in the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima, and then re-interred in Weslaco in January 1949.  His body was moved in 1995 to a burial place near to the [[Iwo Jima Monument]] in [[Harlingen, Texas]], near the [[Marine Military Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|18154|accessdate=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal in film==
Harlon Block is featured in the 2006 [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'', and was portrayed by [[United States|American]] actor [[Benjamin Walker (actor)|Benjamin Walker]]. His parents are portrayed by Christopher Curry  and [[Judith Ivey]]. The film is based on the [[Flags of Our Fathers|book of the same title]].
