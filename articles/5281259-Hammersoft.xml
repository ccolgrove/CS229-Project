'''Johnny Bristol''' (born '''John William Bristol''', February 3, 1939 - March 21, 2004&lt;ref name =&quot;amg&quot;&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p59488|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography - accessed January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;), was an [[United States|American]] [[musician]], most famous as a [[songwriter]] and [[record producer]] for the [[Motown Records|Motown]] [[record label|label]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was a native of [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]], [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt;

==Motown producer==
Bristol first came to local attention in the [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] area as a member of the [[soul music|soul]] [[duet (music)|duo]] 'Johnny &amp; Jackey' with Jackey Beavers,&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; an associate Bristol met while in the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]]. The pair [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] two [[single (music)|singles]] in 1959 for [[Anna Records]], a label owned by Gwen Gordy ([[Berry Gordy]]'s [[sibling|sister]]) and Billy Davis and four 45s for Gwen Gordy and [[Harvey Fuqua]]'s Tri-Phi label, none of which was a success beyond the [[Midwestern United States]].

In the mid 1960s, Motown had absorbed Tri-Phi and Bristol began working with Fuqua as a songwriter and producer. Among their successes as producers were [[hit single]]s such as [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Tammi Terrell]]'s &quot;[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]&quot; (1967), &quot;[[Your Precious Love]]&quot; (1967), and &quot;[[If I Could Build My Whole World Around You]]&quot; (1968); [[Edwin Starr]]'s &quot;Twenty-Five Miles&quot; (1969); and [[David Ruffin]]'s &quot;[[My Whole World Ended (The Moment You Left Me)]]&quot; (1969).

Bristol flourished at Motown working with some of the label's best-selling acts. His producer and/or writer credits included: [[The Velvelettes]] &quot;These Things Keep Me Loving You&quot; (1973); [[Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips]]' &quot;I Don't Want To Do Wrong&quot; (1971) and &quot;Daddy Could Swear, I Declare&quot; (1972); and [[Jr. Walker &amp; the All Stars]], who charted with a number of Bristol-written songs, including &quot;What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)&quot; (1969), &quot;Gotta Hold On To This Feeling&quot; (1970) and &quot;Walk in the Night&quot; (1972). One of his last successes was [[Jermaine Jackson]]'s first solo record, &quot;That's How Love Goes&quot; (1972).

Notably, Bristol was the producer and co-writer of the final singles for both [[The Supremes|Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes]] and [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson &amp; the Miracles]], before each group lost its namesake lead [[singer]]. While the Miracles' &quot;[[We've Come Too Far to End It Now]]&quot; (1972) was an original, the Supremes' &quot;[[Someday We'll Be Together]]&quot; (1969) was a [[cover version]] of a Johnny &amp; Jackey single from 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040325/ai_n12775509 Obituary for Johnny Bristol - Independent, The (London),  Mar 25, 2004 by Pierre Perrone]&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol is the male [[human voice|voice]] on the Supremes' version of &quot;Someday We'll Be Together,&quot; singing response to [[Diana Ross]]' lead vocal&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; (Ross actually recorded the song with [[session musician|session singers]] replacing the other two Supremes).

==Producer and solo performer==
Bristol left Motown in 1973 to join [[CBS Records|CBS]] as a producer. He worked with a number of emerging singers that included [[Randy Crawford]], for whom Bristol wrote &quot;Caught in Love's Triangle&quot;, as well as producing established performers such as [[Marlena Shaw]], [[Johnny Mathis]] and [[Boz Scaggs]]. Now in his early 30s, he was anxious to resume his own recording career, and when CBS/Columbia showed little enthusiasm he signed a [[recording contract]] with [[MGM Records|MGM]].

At MGM, Bristol recorded two successful [[album]]s and charted with several singles, notably &quot;[[Hang on in There Baby]]&quot; (1974, #8 [[Billboard Hot 100|US Pop]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Charts&quot;&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p59488|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com - Charts &amp; Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; #2 US R&amp;B chart and #3 [[UK Singles Chart|UK]]&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;/&gt;), &quot;You and I&quot; (1974, #20 [[Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs|US R&amp;B]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Charts&quot;/&gt;), &quot;Leave My World&quot; (1975, #23 US R&amp;B&lt;ref name=&quot;Charts&quot;/&gt;) and &quot;Do It To My Mind&quot; (1976, #5 US R&amp;B). He also recorded the original version of &quot;[[Love Me for a Reason]]&quot;, later a major hit for [[The Osmonds]]. He was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1975 for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], ultimately  losing out to [[Marvin Hamlisch]].

Bristol then recorded two albums for Atlantic, ''Bristol's Creme'' (1976) and ''Strangers'' (1978). One track from the Atlantic period, &quot;Strangers In The Dark Corners,&quot; has become popular on the European rare-soul scene. He maintained a parallel role as a producer during this period, working mainly for artists signed to [[Columbia Records]], including Boz Scaggs. Bristol can be credited with creating Scaggs' [[blue-eyed soul]] sound for the ''[[Slow Dancer]]'' album (1974). Bristol also produced [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]' 1975 album, ''Memories Don't Leave Like People Do'', which included five covers of Bristol's songs, including the title track. He continued to be held in high regard as a producer, and some of the other acts with whom he worked included [[Tavares (band)|Tavares]], Margie Joseph and [[The Jackson Sisters]].

Bristol's main market was in [[Europe]] by the early 1980s. His [[duet (music)|duet]] with [[Amii Stewart]] on a [[medley (music)|medley]] of &quot;[[My Guy]] - [[My Girl (The Temptations song)|My Girl]]&quot; reached #39 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot;&gt;{{cite book

An accompanying album failed to consolidate his status, and it would be eight years before new product by Bristol appeared, with a 12&quot; single &quot;I'm Just a Musician&quot; for Hansa. An affiliation in 1989 with the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[record label]] [[Motorcity Records]] was brief,&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;/&gt; but did result in one of Bristol's most popular releases, &quot;Man Up in the Sky&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; and a cover of the Bristol-penned &quot;What Does it Take to Win Your Love&quot;, originally a hit for Jr. Walker &amp; the All Stars.

Bristol's last releases were a [[Gramophone record|12&quot; single]] in 1991 for Whichway Records, &quot;Come to Me&quot;, and an album, ''Life &amp; Love'', released for the [[Japan]]ese market in 1993. The latter included [[Earth, Wind &amp; Fire]]'s &quot;That's The Way I Feel About You&quot; as a duet with his daughter, Shanna J. Bristol. The album received a US release three years later under the title ''Come To Me''.

Bristol died in his [[Brighton Township, Michigan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; home on 21 March 2004, of [[Death by natural causes|natural causes]], at the age of sixty-five.&lt;ref&gt;Motown:The Golden Years by Bill Dahl &amp; Weldon A McDougall III p.216-218 Krause ISBN 0-87349-286-2&lt;/ref&gt;
