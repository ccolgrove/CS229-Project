The '''Liverpool Dockers' Strike''' lasted from 1995 to 1998.

Although referred to as a strike it was strictly a ''[[dispute]]'' because the employers, the '''MDHC''' ([[Mersey Docks and Harbour Company]]) had actually used the opportunity to sack the dockers who were caught up in a separate dispute.

The Liverpool dockers refused to cross a [[picket line]] set up in support of a group of fellow dockers working for [[Torside]]. That was on 29 September 1995, and they were sacked by their employers. Some dockers were offered new contracts but all contracts were subject to alteration by the MDHC, so the dispute began. Over the next two and a half years the dockers waged a very high profile public campaign for their reinstatement, and allied themselves with dockers worldwide and support groups such as [[Reclaim the Streets]].  The strike failed in its declared objectives, but was very successful in providing a modern example of strong [[social movement unionism]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. A t-shirt was designed to show support for the dockers incorporating the [[Calvin Klein]] 'CK' into the word docker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://garstontowers.blogspot.com/2010/07/blast-from-past-for-lefty-socialist.html Image of CK t-shirt]&lt;/ref&gt; The t-shirt was worn by many celebrities but most famously by [[Robbie Fowler]] during a goal celebration while playing for [[Liverpool FC]].

The dispute went on to be one of the longest in British industrial relations history. It was in February 1998 that the dockers finally accepted a settlement.

British director [[Ken Loach]] made a documentary about the strike, ''[[The Flickering Flame]]'', in 1997. A group of sacked dockers themselves wrote the script for a film about their experiences with the help of well-known [[Liverpool]] writer [[Jimmy McGovern]] and the author [[Irvine Welsh]]. The film, 'Dockers', was shown on [[Channel 4]] in 1999.

After the dispute some of the dockers bought the Casa Bar on Hope St. in Liverpool town centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/food/bar-reviews/2008/01/14/casa-hope-street-liverpool-64375-20350139/ Liverpool Daily Post bar review]&lt;/ref&gt;.
