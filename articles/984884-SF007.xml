'''Windows NT 3.5''' is the second release of the [[Microsoft]] [[Windows NT]] [[operating system]]. It was released on 21 September 1994.

One of the primary goals during Windows NT 3.5's development was to increase the speed of the operating system; as a result, the project was given the codename &quot;Daytona&quot; in reference to the [[Daytona International Speedway]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mark E. Russinovich |author2=David A. Solomon |authorlink1=Mark Russinovich |authorlink2=David A. Solomon |title=Microsoft Windows Internals |url=http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/book.aspx?ID=6710&amp;locale=en-us |accessdate=4 September 2009 |edition=4th |date=8 December 2004 |publisher=Microsoft |isbn=978-0-7356-1917-3 |quote=The first release of Windows NT was larger and slower than expected, so the next major push was a project called &quot;Daytona&quot;, named after the speedway in Florida. The main goals for this release were to reduce the size of the system, increase the speed of the system, and, of course, to make it more reliable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Windows NT 3.5''' was finally succeeded by [[Windows NT 3.51]] in 1995 and by [[Windows NT 4.0]] in 1996.

This is the first Windows NT version to adopt the names ''Windows NT Workstation'' and ''Windows NT Server'' for its editions. The editions of the previous Windows NT release, [[Windows NT 3.1]], were named ''Windows NT'' and ''Windows NT Advanced Server''. The Workstation edition allowed only 10 concurrent clients to access the file server and no Mac clients. The Server edition included all of the functions and network options.

Windows NT 3.5 included integrated [[Winsock]] and [[TCP/IP]] support. The initial commercially available version of Windows NT, version 3.1, included only a proprietary and quite incomplete implementation of TCP/IP based on the AT&amp;T UNIX System V &quot;Streams&quot; API. The TCP/IP and IPX/SPX stacks in Windows NT 3.5 are rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/140552 How to Optimize Windows NT to Run Over Slow WAN Links w/TCP/IP]&lt;/ref&gt; [[NetBIOS over TCP/IP]] (NetBT) support as a compatibility layer for TCP/IP was introduced as also the Microsoft DHCP and [[Windows Internet Name Service|WINS]] clients and DHCP and WINS servers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/169289 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Basics]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Windows NT 3.5 can share files through FTP and printers through LPR and act as Gopher, Web, and [[Wide area information server|WAIS]] servers. The Windows NT 3.5 Resource Kit included the first implementation of [[Microsoft DNS]]. Windows NT 3.5 included [[Remote Access Service]] for remote dial-up modem access to LAN services using either SLIP or PPP protocols.

Other new features in Windows NT 3.5 include [[VFAT]] (ability to use long file names of up to 255 characters), and support for [[Input/output completion port|I/O completion ports]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sysinternals.kompjoefriek.nl/rip/www.sysinternals.com/Information/IoCompletionPorts.html Inside I/O Completion Ports: Sysinternals]&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a new [[Windows NT startup process|startup]] screen. The interface was updated to be consistent with the [[Windows 3.1x|Windows for Workgroups 3.xx]]. It also upgraded [[Object Linking and Embedding]] (OLE) support from version 1.0 to version 2.0 and is more efficient - performance is higher and it requires less memory than Windows NT 3.1.

Windows NT 3.5 did not support laptop computers as it had no drivers for PCMCIA adapter cards.

In July 1995, Windows NT 3.5 with Service Pack 3 was rated by the [[National Security Agency]] as complying with [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria|TCSEC]] C2 criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows NT Server 4.0 - Maintain - Revision 1.1 |url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc767093.aspx |publisher=Microsoft |year=1998 |accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows NT 3.5 refuses to install on a processor newer than the original [[Intel P5|Pentium]] (P5 core).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows NT 3.5 Setup and the Pentium Pro Processor |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/151212/en-us |publisher=Microsoft |date=1 November 2006 |accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows NT 3.51]] fixed this. It is however possible to modify files on the install CD which will allow it to install.
