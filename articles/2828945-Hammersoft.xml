Text from the original silent film titles:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeIXfdogJbA Alice in Wonderland (1903)], restored version by the BFI/British Film Institute at YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

# &quot;Alice dreams that she sees the White Rabbit and follows him down the Rabbit-hole, into the Hall of Many Doors.&quot;
# &quot;Alice, now very small, has gained access to the Garden where she meets a Dog and tries to make him play with her.&quot;
# &quot;Alice enters the White Rabbit's tiny House, but, having suddenly resumed her normal size, she is unable to get out until she remembers the magic fan.&quot;
# &quot;The Duchess's Cheshire Cat appears to Alice and directs her to the Mad Hatter. â The Mad Tea-Party.&quot;
# &quot;THE ROYAL PROCESSION â The Queen invites Alice to join. â Alice unintentionally offends the Queen who calls the Executioner to behead her. But Alice, growing bolder, boxes his ears and in the confusion which results, she awakes.&quot;
