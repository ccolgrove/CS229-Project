The '''Leader of the Labour Party''' is the most senior politician within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Since 25 September 2010, the office has been held by [[Ed Miliband]], following the resignation of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]].

[[Harriet Harman]] is currently the [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party]]
==Background==
The post of Leader of the Labour Party was officially created in 1922. Before this time, between when Labour MPs were first elected in [[UK general election, 1906|1906]] and the election in [[UK general election, 1922|1922]], when substantial gains were made, the post was known as '''[[Parliamentary Labour Party|Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party]]'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;A History Of The British Labour Party&quot;&gt; Thorpe, Andrew. (2001) ''A History Of The British Labour Party'', Palgrave, ISBN 0-333-92908-x&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other British political party leaders, the Labour Leader does not have the power to dismiss or appoint their Deputy. Both the Leader and Deputy Leader are elected by an [[Alternative Vote]] system in an electoral college, with a third of the votes allocated to the Party's [[List of Labour Party (UK) MPs|MPs]] and [[List of members of the European Parliament 2009â2014|MEPs]], a third to individual members of the Labour Party, and a third to individual members of all affiliated organisations, including [[Socialist society (Labour Party)|socialist societies]] and [[Affiliated trade union|trade unions]].

When the Labour Party is in [[Her Majesty's Most Loyal Opposition|Opposition]], as it currently is, the Leader of the Labour Party usually acts as the [[Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition|Leader of the Opposition]], and chairs the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]]. Concordantly, when the Party is in [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]], the Leader would usually become the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[First Lord of the Treasury]] and [[Minister for the Civil Service]], as well as appointing the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]].

In 1921, [[John Robert Clynes]] became the first Leader of the Labour Party to be born in [[England]]; prior to this, all Leaders had been born in [[Scotland]]. In [[UK general election, 1924|1924]], [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first ever [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], leading a minority administration. [[Clement Attlee]] would become the first Leader to lead a majority government in [[UK general election, 1945|1945]]. The first to be born in [[Wales]] was [[Neil Kinnock]], who was elected in [[UK general election, 1983|1983]]. The most electorally successful Labour Leader to date is [[Tony Blair]], who won three in [[UK general election, 1997|1997]], [[UK general election, 2001|2001]], both [[landslide victories]], and [[UK general election, 2005|2005]].

&lt;sup&gt;â &lt;/sup&gt; Although these were technically leaders of the Labour Party, they only assumed this role because of the death or resignation of the incumbent and were not elected to the post. They were in effect acting temporary leaders. [[Margaret Beckett]] was deputy leader when leader [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] suddenly and unexpectedly died, Beckett automatically became leader as a result of his death. Similarly [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] became leader after the death of [[Hugh Gaitskell]], Brown too had been deputy leader at the time of Gaitskell's death. [[Harriet Harman]] was deputy leader when [[Gordon Brown]] resigned the leadership in the wake of his May 2010 election defeat, she too became leader automatically and remained leader while the Labour Party went through the process of electing a new leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.savethelabourparty.org/labourpartyrulebook2008.pdf|title=Labour Party Rule Book 2008|publisher=The Labour Party|quote=&quot;When the party is in opposition and the party leader, for whatever reason, becomes permanently unavailable, the deputy leader shall automatically become party leader on a pro-tem basis.&quot;|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
It is not uncommon for a retired Leader of the Labour Party to be granted a [[peerage]] upon their retirement, particularly if they served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]; examples of this include [[Clement Attlee]] and [[Harold Wilson]]. However, [[Neil Kinnock]] was also elevated to the [[House of Lords]], despite never being Prime Minister, and [[Michael Foot]] declined a similar offer.

There are currently five living former Leaders of the Labour Party (with the period they were in office):
* [[Baron#Style of address|The Rt Hon]]&lt;/small&gt; [[Neil Kinnock|The Lord Kinnock]] (1983â1992)
* [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#Rights and privileges of members|The Rt Hon]] [[Margaret Beckett]] &lt;small&gt;[[Member of Parliament|MP]]&lt;/small&gt; (1994)
* [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#Rights and privileges of members|The Rt Hon]] [[Tony Blair]]&lt;!-- No 'PC' for Privy Council here as Tony Blair is not a peer --&gt; (1994â2007)
* [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#Rights and privileges of members|The Rt Hon]] [[Gordon Brown]] &lt;small&gt;[[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]&lt;/small&gt; (2007â2010)
* [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council#Rights and privileges of members|The Rt Hon]] [[Harriet Harman]] &lt;small&gt;[[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]&lt;/small&gt; (2010)
