'''JkDefrag''' is a free [[open source]] [[Defragmentation|disk defragmenting]] [[Utility software|utility]] [[computer program]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It was developed by Jeroen Kessels beginning in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Information obtained from product release notes: history.txt file&lt;/ref&gt; and is released under the [[GNU]] [[GPL|General Public License]]. The &quot;Jk&quot; part of the utility name is taken from the developer's name, Jeroen Kessels. In 2008, from version 4, much changed from previous versions; JkDefrag was renamed [[MyDefrag]] by its developer, and JkDefrag was discontinued, although still available. MyDefrag is [[closed source]] [[freeware]].

== Operation ==

JkDefrag has many options. If run without options it groups files into 3 zones with the intention of optimizing speed: 
# Directories and system files
# Regular files
# Large files referred to as &quot;space hogs&quot; in the documentation
Files outside their zone are moved to their zone. Directories are perhaps the most accessed data on disk, so zone 1 is placed at the beginning of the drive. After the directories comes a free space area, then zone 2 with regular files, another free area, and then zone 3 with &quot;space hogs&quot;, which are large files, archives, recycle bin contents, service pack files, and other infrequently accessed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kessels.nl/JkDefrag/index.html | title = JkDefrag v3.36 | first = Jeoren | last = Kessels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* No need for installation; runs with default options by opening JkDefrag.exe;
* [[Screensaver]] defragmentation, with the option to run another screensaver when done;
* Source code (Microsoft Visual C++ 2005) available;

JkDefrag runs on the Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista Operating Systems, and defragments both [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] and [[NTFS]] filesystems. It uses the standard Windows defragmentation [[API]]. User support was provided through web-based forums.
