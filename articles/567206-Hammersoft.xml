'''CITV-DT''' is a [[television station]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. Known on air as '''Global Edmonton''', the station is owned by [[Shaw Media]], and is an [[owned-and-operated station]] (O&amp;O) of the [[Global Television Network]]. It transmits on channel 13 and cable 8 in Edmonton, and is carried on the [[Bell TV]] (channel 240) and [[Shaw Direct]] (channel 339) [[direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] services. Its high-definition/digital signal is available on Shaw HD on channel 211, and on Telus Optik on channel 610.

CITV is carried by the [[Canadian Satellite Communications|Cancom]] system from 1981 as an independent signal for Canadian cable television systems too distant to receive a variety of television signals over-the-air.

CITV's programming is similar to [[CICT-TV]], the Global O&amp;O in [[Calgary]]. CITV's master control is also based out of CICT, along with all the rest of Shaw's television stations. The station carries the full Global network schedule along with 39 hours a week of local news programming.

==History==
{{Expand section|further information on CITV's history|date=September 2011}}
[[File:ITV Logo Old.jpg|thumb|left|150px|First logo used while as ''ITV'', used during the 1980s.]]
The station was launched on September 1, 1974. CITV was originally owned by [[Allarcom]], owned by Dr. [[Charles Allard]], and launched as '''Independent Television (ITV)''', a brand used until 2000 when it became part of the Global Television Network. In 1991, Allarcom was purchased by [[Western International Communications]]' WIC Television division, which in turn was purchased by Canwest in 1999. It joined the Global Television Network on September 4, 2000, along with fellow Alberta stations [[CICT-TV|CICT]] and [[CISA-TV|CISA]], but had been carrying Global's programming since 1988.

==News operation==
[[File:CITV 1990.PNG|thumb|100px|left|''ITV'' logo used from 1990s until the 2000 when CITV joined Global. For logos used as Global, please refer to the [[Global Television Network]] article.]]
The station currently produces a total of 45 hours of local newscasts each week; seven hours of news every weekday (consisting of a 3Â½ hour morning newscast, hour-long newscasts at noon and 6 p.m., and half-hour newscasts at 5 and 11 p.m.), and five hours on weekends (consisting of a three-hour Saturday morning newscast, two-hour Sunday morning news cast, an hour-long newscast at 6 p.m. and half-hour newscast at 11 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday nights).

The station is also the first in Edmonton to have a news helicopter. The helicopter, called Global 1, is shared with [[CHED (AM)]] for their traffic reports during the ''Morning News'' (5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.) and the ''Early News'' (5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 5:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.). The helicopter is also used frequently for breaking news coverage. Both CHED ([[Corus Entertainment]]) and CITV (Shaw Media) are owned by the [[J. R. Shaw|Shaw family]], but are operated as separate businesses.

On November 15, 2010, Global Edmonton became the first television station in Alberta to produce and broadcast its locally-produced programming in [[high-definition television|high definition]].

On May 31, 2011, Shaw Media announced that a new two-hour Sunday morning newscast will debut on CITV-DT on September 11, 2011, running from 8-10 a.m. [[Mountain Time Zone|MT]]. In addition, the ''Saturday Morning News'' will be expanded to three hours, running from 7-10 a.m. MT, on the following day.&lt;ref&gt;http://newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2011/31/c9068.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/global-edmonton-expands-morning-news-coverage/1000570623/ Global Edmonton Expands Morning News Coverage]&lt;/ref&gt;
