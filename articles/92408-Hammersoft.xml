== Tournament of Roses Parade ==
[[Image:PreRoseParade-010104.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Spectators gather before the 2004 Rose Parade.]]
{{Main|Tournament of Roses Parade}}
Pasadena is home to the Tournament of Roses Parade, held each year on January 1 (or on January 2, if the 1st falls on a Sunday). The first parade was held in 1890 and was originally sponsored by the [[Valley Hunt Club]], a Pasadena [[social club]]. The motivation for having the parade was, as member Professor Charles F. Holder said, &quot;In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let's hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose&quot;&gt;[http://tournamentofroses.com/history/ Tournament of Roses History]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1895, the festivities had outgrown the Valley Hunt Club, and the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses|Tournament of Roses Association]] was  formed to take charge of the parade.  The Rose Parade, as it is familiarly known, traditionally features elaborate floats. According to the organizers, &quot;Every inch of every float must be covered with flowers, or other natural materials, such as leaves, seeds, or bark.  On average a float requires about 100,000 flowers and greenery. Volunteer workers swarm over the floats in the days after Christmas, their hands and clothes covered with glue and petals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;float&quot;&gt;[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/events/floatdecorating.asp Float Decorating ~ Tournament of Roses]&lt;/ref&gt; The most perishable flowers are placed in small vials of water, which are placed onto the float individually. Over the almost 3 hours of the parade, floats, and participants travel over five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km)&lt;ref name=&quot;float&quot;/&gt; and pass by over one million viewers who traditionally camp out over New Year's Eve to have the best view along the parade route.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather1&quot;&gt;[http://uk.weather.com/events/events-Pasadena-USCA0840?eventId=42104&amp;cat=2229 Doo Dah Parade Event Details - weather.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rose Parade is satirized by the popular [[Doo Dah Parade]], an annual event that originated in Old Pasadena in 1978, and soon gained national notoriety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasdd&quot;&gt;[http://www.pasadenadoodahparade.info/dd_info.htm Pasadena Doo Dah Parade 2011 | Information]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Readers Digest]]'' named the Doo Dah Parade âAmericaâs Best Paradeâ, and was a recent feature in ''50 Places You Must Visit Before You Die!''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasdd&quot; /&gt;  It was formerly held around Thanksgiving, a month before the Rose Parade,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasadenadoodahparade.info/ 2011 Pasadena Doo Dah Parade - Welcome]&lt;/ref&gt; but the parade is now held in May. In 2011, after 33 years in Pasadena, the parade moved to East Pasadena for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather1&quot;/&gt; It features unusual and absurd entrants such as the BBQ &amp; Hibachi Marching Grill Team, the Men of Leisure, and the Bastard Sons of Lee Marvin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasdd&quot;/&gt; Proceeds from the parade's pancake breakfast, t-shirts, and after-party are donated to charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pasdd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasadenadoodahparade.info/dd_archive.htm Pasadena Doo Dah Parade 2011 | Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rose Bowl Game===

The [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], is host of the first, oldest, and most famous [[college football]] postseason [[bowl game]], the [[Pasadena Tournament of Roses|Tournament of Roses]] Rose Bowl Game, every New Year's Day. In 1895, the Tournament of Roses Association was formed to take charge of the parade. In 1902, the association declared that a football game would be added to the day's events. The game, now known as the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], would become the first New year's post-season college football game ever and has developed into a tradition in many college arenas. Soon outgrowing its original facility, a new stadium was constructed in the Arroyo Seco area. The new stadium hosted its first New Year's Day football game in 1923 and was soon christened &quot;The Rose Bowl.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose&quot; /&gt;

===Fire Department===
The Pasadena Fire Department moved into its first formal and permanent station in 1889. Before that they had been housed in a ramshackle structure and summoned by the church bell. There were 24 firemen for two shifts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/Fire/FirstPermanentStation/ City of Pasadena Fire Department]&lt;/ref&gt;
Today The Pasadena Fire Department consists of 185 full time employees, 153 shift personnel, 32 administrative personnel, and eight modern fire stations that serve an area in a radius of {{convert|60|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/Fire/GeneralInformation/ City of Pasadena Fire Department]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and Power Department===
Pasadena Water and Power Department (PWP) provides services to an area {{convert|60|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and includes areas outside of the city proper including unincorporated areas of southern Altadena, East Pasadena, Chapman Woods, and East San Gabriel. 

Pasadena created the Pasadena Municipal Light and Power Department in 1906. On May 3, 1906, a $125,000 bond was issued to pay for the construction of a power plant. This first power plant was a wood frame and corrugated sheet iron structure which housed one 200-kW Crocker-Wheeler generator driven by a Fleming-Corliss engine, one 200-pound pressure boiler, a condenser, pumps, and other auxiliary equipment and only supplied power to the city's street lights. Expanding continued and more generating capacity was expanded and the city then offered power to commercial customers in 1908, and bought out [[Southern California Edison]]'s Pasadena operations in 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;power&quot;&gt;[http://ww2.cityofpasadena.net/waterandpower/aboutpwp_history.asp City of Pasadena Department of Water and Power]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 the city contracted with the federal government to buy electricity from [[Boulder Dam]], later renamed [[Hoover Dam]], which began delivering power in 1935.  

During the [[Great Depression|Depression]] the power company extended its building programs to provide short term jobs for citizens by severally affected by the collapse  of the economy. Customers were permitted to work for the company for two week periods to earn money for  food, utility bills and housing. Following many further improvements, two 50,000 kW generating units in a completely new outdoor plant went on-line in 1955 and 1958. In June 1965, a 71 MW, 83 MVA reheat unit with steam backup auxiliaries was put into service to cover the growing needs for more power in the city. 

In 1911, the city began condemnation actions against a number of small, local water companies. In 1912, the Water Department was created; in 1913, it began actual operations. The city continued to acquire small, local water companies for several decades afterwards, usually ''en toto'', such as the Pasadena Lake Vineyard and Land Company, and sometimes in part, such as Las Flores Water Company's southern portions and San Gabriel Valley Water Company's operations in the southern reaches of Pasadena. In 1915, the Water Department added a chlorine generation system (from the Electro Beaching Gas Company of New York)to disinfect water taken from the Arroyo Seco. In the late 1920s, Pasadena took the initiative to obtain water from the Colorado River and lead the formation of the [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]] (MWDSC or &quot;Met&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The charter for the MWDSC was signed on November 6, 1928. In 1967, the Water Department and the Light and Power department were consolidated into the &quot;Pasadena Water and Power Department&quot; (or PWP).&lt;ref name=&quot;power&quot;/&gt;

It operates a number of wells, has a spreading ground for the capture of surface water from the Arroyo Seco, and purchases surface water from MWDSC. Historically, water from the Arroyo Seco and Eaton Canyon were collected and distributed directly to the service areas. Not long after the city took over operations, 1915, chlorine was added to the Arroyo Seco water. In 1971 the John Behner Treatment Plant was constructed to give full surface water treatment to the Arroyo Seco water. Eventually as regulatory limits were made stricter, PWP ceased all direct surface water treatment. The use of spreading grounds to recharge ground water on both the Arroyo Seco and Eaton Canyon capture considerable volumes of water, a little over {{convert|2,000|acre.ft|m3}} per year.

A number of wells on the west side of the service area had become contaminated with volatile organic chemicals and perchlorate and had to be shut down several years. A treatment plant was built to remove these chemicals which began operation in July 2011.

=== Public transit ===
[[Image:Memorialparkstation.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Gold Line Memorial Park Station.]]

Pasadena is the northern terminus of the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Los Angeles Metro]] [[Metro Gold Line (LACMTA)|Gold Line]] [[light rail]], which originates at the [[Atlantic (LACMTA station)|Atlantic Station]] in East Los Angeles. Opening in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pasadena to Los Angeles rail service returns today|newspaper=Pasadena Star-News|author=Mary Bender|date=June 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are currently six Gold Line stations in Pasadena: [[Fillmore (LACMTA station)|Fillmore Station]], [[Del Mar (LACMTA station)|Del Mar Station]] in [[Old Pasadena]], [[Memorial Park (LACMTA station)|Memorial Park Station]] in Old Pasadena, [[Lake (LACMTA station)|Lake Station]] in Downtown, [[Allen (LACMTA station)|Allen Station]] and [[Sierra Madre Villa (LACMTA station)|Sierra Madre Villa Station]]. Construction began in June 2010 to extend the Gold Line east through several additional foothill communities of the San Gabriel Valley.

Pasadena is also served by various bus services. The [[Pasadena Area Rapid Transit System]] exclusively serves the city while Los Angeles metropolitan area bus services [[Foothill Transit]], [[LADOT Commuter Express|LADOT]], [[Metro Local]] and [[Metro Rapid]] also serve Pasadena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.cityofpasadena.net/trans/transit/default.asp Transit Operations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trains===
[[File:ATSF 1890s passenger train.jpg|225px|thumb|An AT&amp;SF [[passenger train]] in operation, ''circa'' 1895.]]
Pasadena was served by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] at a [[Santa Fe Depot (Pasadena)|Santa Fe Depot]] in downtown when the Second District was opened in 1887.&lt;ref name=&quot;train&quot;&gt;[http://www.trainweb.com/cities/city_pas.html] Train Web&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, the historical and traditionally-styled station in Pasadena was opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;train&quot;/&gt;  Originally, the Second District was an invaluable line; it served manufacturing and agricultural businesses throughout the entire San Gabriel Valley. Unfortunately, the longer trains had great difficulty climbing the precipitous 2.2% grade at [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]], between Pasadena and Los Angeles. Additional locomotives were often necessary, causing a more costly and less efficient operation. The still-used Third District opened in 1888, just a year after the Second District, and rapidly took over most of longer freight trains more efficaciously.&lt;ref name=&quot;train&quot;/&gt;

The Second District and the Pasadena Depot became well known by the many transcontinental passenger trains that it served. Historically, up to 26 passenger trains went through Pasadena every day. In order to avoid the media in Los Angeles, many celebrities chose to use Pasadena as their main train station, bringing to it an ambience and legacy of the glamour of old Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;train&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;La times&quot;/&gt;

[[Amtrak]] took over passenger rail operations in 1971, serving Pasadena with trains such as the ''[[Southwest Chief]]'', ''[[Las Vegas Limited]]'', and ''[[Desert Wind]]''. On January 15, 1994, the final ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' train arrived in Pasadena.&lt;ref name=&quot;La times&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Final Boarding Call Nostalgia|author=Bob Pool|date=January 15, 1994|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATSF sold the line between Los Angeles and San Bernardino via Pasadena (known as the &quot;second division&quot;). (Now the ''Southwest Chief'' operates over the [[Southern Transcon|transcon]] via Fullerton.) The LACMTA Gold Line still uses the same [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] (although different tracks) as the Santa Fe did. The old depot is still visible at the [[Del Mar (LACMTA station)|Del Mar station]].

=== Airports ===
[[Bob hope airport|Bob Hope Airport]] (also known as Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport) in nearby [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] serves as the regional airport for Pasadena. The airport is owned and operated by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. The airport is under the control of the governments of the three cities for which it is named. Most destinations from Bob Hope Airport are within the  United States, so [[Los Angeles Airport|Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Ontario International Airport|LA/Ontario International Airport]] in [[Ontario, California|Ontario]] are also important airports less than an hour from Pasadena. [[Long Beach Airport]] in [[Long Beach, California]], is about an hour's drive away. [[John Wayne Airport]] in [[Orange County, California]], is slightly more than an hourâs drive away from Pasadena.

=== Freeways and highways ===
Four freeways run through Pasadena, and Pasadena is a [[control city]] for all of them. The most important is the [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill Freeway (I-210)]] which enters the northwestern portion of the city from [[La CaÃ±ada Flintridge, California|La CaÃ±ada Flintridge]]. The Foothill Freeway initially runs due south, passing the [[Rose Bowl Stadium|Rose Bowl]] before its junction with the [[California State Route 134|Ventura Freeway]]. At this interchange, the Foothill Freeway shifts its alignment and direction, becoming an east-west freeway, exiting the city on its eastern boundary before entering [[Arcadia, California|Arcadia]]. The Foothill Freeway connects Pasadena with [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]] (westbound) and [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] (eastbound).
[[Image:210Freeway.JPG|thumb|left|240px|[[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill Freeway (I-210)]] as seen from the Metro Gold Line [[Sierra Madre Villa (LACMTA station)|Sierra Madre Villa Station]]]]

The [[California State Route 134|Ventura Freeway (SR 134)]] starts at the junction of the [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill Freeway (I-210)]] at the edge of downtown Pasadena and travels westward. This freeway is the main connector to [[Bob hope airport|Bob Hope Airport]] and the [[San Fernando Valley]].

A spur of the controversial [[California State Route 710|Long Beach Freeway (SR 710 in Pasadena)]] is also located in Pasadena. The Long Beach Freeway was intended to connect [[Long Beach, CA|Long Beach]] to Pasadena but a gap, known as the [[Interstate 710#The South Pasadena Gap|South Pasadena Gap]], between [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] and Pasadena has not been completed due to legal battles involving the city of South Pasadena. The spur starts at the junction of the [[California State Route 134|Ventura Freeway]] and [[Interstate 210 and State Route 210 (California)|Foothill Freeway]] and travels south along the eastern edge of Old Pasadena with two exits for [[Colorado Boulevard]] and Del Mar Boulevard before ending at an at-grade intersection with [[California Boulevard (Pasadena)|California Boulevard]]. Currently, Caltrans is researching the possibility of using advanced tunneling technologies to build the Long Beach Freeway under South Pasadena without disturbing the [[residential]] neighborhoods on the surface. This would create twin tunnels that are {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} long, the longest in the United States.

[[Image:Pasadena Colorado Street Bridge 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Colorado Street Bridge seen from the Arroyo Seco below]]
The [[Arroyo Seco Parkway|Arroyo Seco Parkway (SR 110)]] (also known as the Pasadena Freeway) is the first freeway in California, connecting Los Angeles with Pasadena alongside the [[Arroyo Seco (Los Angeles County)|Arroyo Seco]] and is the primary access to [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The freeway enters the southern part of the city from South Pasadena. Only one exit is actually inside city limits, the southbound exit connecting to State Street with access to [[Fair Oaks Avenue]]. At Glenarm Street, the freeway ends and the four-lane Arroyo Parkway continues northward to Old Pasadena.

Three state highways enter the city of Pasadena. Arroyo Parkway (SR 110), maintained by the city of Pasadena, runs from the termination of the Pasadena Freeway at Glenarm Street to Colorado Boulevard in Old Town Pasadena. While Arroyo Parkway continues north two more blocks, SR 110 ends at Glenarm Street.

[[Rosemead Boulevard]] ([[California State Route 19|SR 19]]) is a state highway on the eastern edge of Pasadena and [[East Pasadena, California|unincorporated Pasadena]] from [[Huntington Drive]] to [[Foothill Boulevard (Southern California)|Foothill Boulevard]].

An obscure portion of the [[Angeles Crest Highway]] ([[California State Route 2|SR 2]]) in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] cuts through Pasadena near the Angeles Crest Ranger Station. This {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of highway in the Angeles National Forest is north of [[La CaÃ±ada Flintridge, California|La CaÃ±ada Flintridge]] and west of [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]] and is approximately {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in elevation.

Historic [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|U.S. Route 66]] used to run through Pasadena until it was decommissioned in 1964. The historic highway entered Pasadena from the east on Colorado Boulevard and then jogged south on Arroyo Parkway before becoming part of the [[Pasadena Freeway|Pasadena Freeway (SR 110)]].

The intersection of [[Fair Oaks Avenue (Pasadena, California)|Fair Oaks Avenue]] and Colorado Boulevard in Old Pasadena is the zero-zero, east-west, north-south postal division of Pasadena.

== Culture ==
=== Performing arts ===
[[File:Pasadena City Hall 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pasadena City Hall]]]]
The Pasadena Symphony, founded in 1862, offers several concerts a year at the [[Pasadena Civic Center]] and the Pasadena Pops plays at the Rose Bowl. The Civic Center also holds a few traveling [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows each year. The legendary [[Pasadena Playhouse]], presently in reorganization, usually presents seven shows a season, each show running six to eight weeks. The [[Furious Theatre Company]] is one of several small theatre companies in Pasadena. They are currently housed in the [[Carrie Hamilton#Theatre|Carrie Hamilton Theatre]] adjacent to the Pasadena Playhouse. Boston Court Performing Arts Center, opened in 2003, is near Lake and Colorado. Its resident theatre company, the award-winning The Theatre @ Boston Court presents four productions a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostoncourt.com|title=Boston Court|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music at the Court presents numerous music concerts each year, ranging from classical to [[jazz]]. The Friends of the Levitt organization presents a free summer concert series in Memorial Park, with the 2008 summer season marking its sixth year.

Beckman Auditorium and other venues on the Caltech campus present a wide range of performing arts, lectures, films, classes and entertainment events, primarily during the academic year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.caltech.edu/venues.html Venues]&lt;/ref&gt;

The California Philharmonic performs two series in Pasadena, Cal Phil at the [[Ambassador Auditorium]] from November through April, and Cal Phil Music Martinis &amp; the Maestro in the Romanesque Room at the Green Hotel from January to May. They also perform Cal Phil Festival on the Green at nearby Los Angeles County Arboretum &amp; Botanic Garden in Arcadia from July to September, and from July to August Cal Phil at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. In conjunction with The Old Mill Foundation, they perform a summer chamber concert series Cal Phil at the Mill in San Marino.

For more than ten years, twice annually Pasadena's cultural institutions have opened their doors for free during ArtNight Pasadena,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnightpasadena.org |title= ArtNight Pasadena |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering the public a rich sampling of quality art, artifacts and music within the city.  This has evolved into the yearly PasadenART Weekend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasadenaartweekend.org |title= Celebrate the Arts in Pasadena |accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a three day citywide event which, as of 2007, encompasses ArtNight, ArtWalk, ArtHeritage, ArtMarket, and ArtPerformance, a vibrant outdoor music event showcasing emerging and nationally recognized talent.  Free concerts take place on multiple stages throughout Old Pasadena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnightpasadena.org/ Art Night Pasadena]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2008-1226-Pasadena-001-AmbassadorCollege-pan.JPG|left|thumb|270px|The Ambassador Auditorium, center, along with other former Ambassador College buildings, in December 2008.]]

[[Ambassador Auditorium]] was built under the guidance of [[Herbert W. Armstrong]] as both a facility to be used by the [[Worldwide Church of God]] for religious services and as a concert hall for public performances celebrating the [[performing arts]].  In 2007, the native Pasadena band [[Ozma (band)|Ozma]] reunited and produced the album ''Pasadena'' in tribute to the city. The album photos and artwork were shot at the [[Colorado Street Bridge (Pasadena, California)|Colorado Street Bridge]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The 1960s song &quot;[[The Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]&quot; parodies a popular Southern California image of Pasadena as home to a large population of aged eccentrics.  In the song, [[Jan and Dean]] sing of an elderly lady who drives a powerful &quot;[[Dodge 330|Super Stock Dodge]]&quot; [[muscle car]] and is &quot;the terror of Colorado Boulevard.&quot;  The [[Dead Kennedys]] paid a tribute to this archetypal song in the track &quot;Buzzbomb From Pasadena&quot; in the album ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]''.

=== Visual arts ===
A number of artists of national repute, such as [[Guy Rose]], [[Alson S. Clark]], [[Marion Wachtel]] and [[Ernest A. Batchelder]], of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], made Pasadena their home in the early twentieth century.  The formation of the [[California Art Club]], Pasadena Arts Institute and the [[Pasadena Society of Artists]] heralded the city's emergence as a regional center for the visual arts.

===Museums and galleries===
Pasadena is home to a number of art museums and public galleries, including the Norton Simon Museum, widely acknowledged as one of the finest art collections in the Western United States.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The museum's collections include European paintings, sculpture, and tapestry; sculpture from [[Southern Asia]]; and an extensive [[sculpture garden]]. The museum also has the [[contemporary art]] collection of its predecessor, the Pasadena Museum of Art, which focused on [[Modern art|modern]] and contemporary art before being taken over by Simon in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nortonsimon.org/directions-and-parking/ Directions and Parking Â» Norton Simon Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Preserving and sharing the rich history and culture of Pasadena and its adjacent communities is the ''Pasadena Museum of History.'' Located on a campus of {{convert|2|acre|m2}}, it has gardens, a history center, the Finnish Folk Art Museum, the Curtin House, and the Fenyes Mansion, a 1906 [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]]-style architectural residence and a Pasadena Cultural Heritage Landmark.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Orange Grove Boulevard===
[[Image:Tournament House.jpg|thumb|Tournament House]]
{{main|Orange Grove Boulevard}}
The [[Norton Simon Museum]] is at the intersection of Orange Grove and Colorado Boulevards. This corner is the official start of the Rose Parade route and the museum can be quite clearly seen every year during the parade television broadcast.

Orange Grove Boulevard is one of several exclusive residential districts in Pasadena, and has been a home for the rich and famous since the early 20th century. Because of the number of landmark mansions, the street earned the name [[Millionaire's Row]], an appropriate sobriquet considering that the estates that once lined this spacious boulevard and the surrounding neighborhood read like a [[Who's Who]] of American consumer products.

===Historical estates===
The maker of [[Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company|Wrigley's chewing gum]], [[William Wrigley Jr.]]'s, substantial home was offered to the city of Pasadena after Mrs. Wrigley's death in 1958, under the condition that their home would be the Rose Parade's permanent headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/aboutus/house.asp Tournament House, Pasadena, California]&lt;/ref&gt; The stately [[Tournament House]] stands today, and serves as the headquarters for the Tournament of Roses Parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/pasadena-tournament-of-roses/the-house/history History of the Tournament House - Pasadena Tournament of RosesÂ®]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tournamentofroses.com/pasadena-tournament-of-roses/the-house/history Pasadena Tournament of RosesÂ®]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Adolphus Busch]], co-founder of [[Anheuser-Busch]], brewer of [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] beer, established the first of a series of [[Busch Gardens]] in Pasadena. When Busch died at his Pasadena estate, his wife generously offered the property to the City of Pasadena, an offer the city inexplicably refused. [[Henry Markham]], who lived adjacent to Busch, was the 18th Governor of the state of California (1891â1895) and wrote ''Pasadena: Its Early Years''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000134 MARKHAM, Henry Harrison - Biographical Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The home of David Gamble, son of consumer product maker James Gamble of [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], is located on the north end of Orange Grove Boulevard.

== Shopping and dining ==
[[Image:Old Town Pasadena.jpg|thumb]]
Old Pasadena spans 21 blocks downtown.  It boasts upscale retail shops and a wide variety of restaurants, nightclubs, outdoor cafÃ©s, pubs, and comedy clubs. &quot;One Colorado&quot; features renovated historic architecture that attracted the new retail stores and restaurants. This development filled vacant buildings and was the impetus of the revitalization of Old Town on Colorado Boulevard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onecolorado.com/facts.html One Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paseo Colorado]] is an upscale shopping mall designed to be a modern urban village. An open-air mall that covers three city blocks, Paseo Colorado is anchored on the west end by upscale grocery store Gelson's, on the east end by Macy's and Arclight Cinemas centers the middle portion of the mall.  Another shopping district is located in the [[South Lake, Pasadena, California|South Lake Avenue]] neighborhood. On Lake Avenue, an old [[Macy's]] department store and furniture gallery is in a registered California historical landmark. The building was originally designed and built as the fourth [[Bullock's]] department store in the mid 1950s (the last freestanding store they constructed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.cityofpasadena.net/planninganddevelopment/CentralArea/SouthLake.asp South Lake Business District]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pasadena averages {{convert|21|in|mm}} of rain a year, about 6&amp;nbsp;inches more than nearby Los Angeles due to the [[rain shadow]] effect created by the [[San Gabriel Mountains]].  Situated at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, snow is known to fall occasionally in Pasadena.   The heaviest snowfall in Pasadena history occurred on January 11, 1949; 6&amp;nbsp;inches fell at Pasadena's city hall and more than {{convert|12|in|mm}} fell in the foothills of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca6719 |title=PASADENA, CALIFORNIA - Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
===Civic Auditorium venue===
The Civic Auditorium is on Green Street.  It was designed to be the south cornerstone of Pasadena's  Civic Plaza.  Every year, the popular television competition, [[American Idol]] films their &quot;Hollywood Week&quot; show  there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanidol.com/auditions/season_9/los_angeles/ Los Angeles - Season 9 Auditions - American Idol&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the venue for the [[Miss Teen USA 2007]] pageant.  The main auditorium is large enough to have been  home to the annual [[Emmy Awards]] ceremony for nearly 25 years, from 1977 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Emmy_Awards/|title=Emmy Awards|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Television ===
Pasadena is the setting of many TV shows including ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://hookedonhouses.net/2009/03/08/brothers-sisters-nora-walkers-house-in-pasadena/ Brothers &amp; Sisters: Nora Walkerâs House in Pasadena]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigbangtheorystreaming.com/ The Big Bang Theory Streaming]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Pasadena Community Network|Pasadena Community Access Corporation]] oversees four television stations: The Arroyo Channel (Channel 32), KPAS (Channel 3), KLRN (Channel 95) and PCC TV (Channel 96).

=== Radio ===
Pasadena has been home to a number of notable radio stations. In 1967 radio iconoclasts Tom and Raechel Donahue took over an aging studio in the basement of the Pasadena Presbyterian Church and introduced Los Angeles to FM freeform radio. Broadcasting under the [[KPPC (defunct)|KPPC-FM]] call sign at 106.7 FM it quickly became the voice of the counterculture and provided the soundtrack to LA's hippie era.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Early on-air personalities included [[Michael McKean]], [[David Lander]], [[Harry Shearer]], and  [[Dr. Demento]]. The staff was fired en masse in 1971 and the station lost its distinctive personality.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Today the primary radio station in Pasadena goes by the call sign [[KPCC (radio station)|KPCC]] located at 89.3 FM. Broadcasting from the Pasadena City College campus, this public radio station carries many shows from [[National Public Radio]] but maintains an independent streak, committing a large chunk of air time to presenting local and state news. Accordingly, the station has received numerous awards for journalistic excellence and continues to be an important part of the city's heritage.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=== Newspapers ===
Pasadena's largest newspaper is the ''[[Pasadena Star-News]]'', which was first published in 1884. The alternative ''[[Pasadena Weekly]]'' is published by [[Southland Publishing]]. The ''[[Pasadena Sun]]'', a community weekly, is published by ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''.

=== Parrots ===

Pasadena has a large, non-indigenous population of  [[Feral parrots|naturalized parrots]].  According to the &quot;Parrot Project of Los Angeles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://natureali.org/parrot_project/suburban_jungles.htm Parrot Project of Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt; the parrots are of at least five species.&lt;ref name=&quot;CApp&quot;&gt;[http://www.californiaparrotproject.org/ The California Parrot Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;par&quot;&gt;[http://www.ci.pasadena.ca.us/About/ City of Pasadena, Pasadena Facts, Parrots]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some residents have come to enjoy the birds as part of their unique city's culture,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasadenaviews.com/sunday-spectrum-pasadenas-parrots Pasadena Parrots Enjoy Spring]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://socalrunning.com/the-parrots-of-pasadena/ The Parrots of Pasadena | SoCalRunning.com]&lt;/ref&gt; while others consider them to be loud pests. Many theories surround the mystery of how the parrots landed in Pasadena and claimed the area as their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottsla.com/articles-parrots-wild-in-pasadena.htm Wild Parrots in Pasadena? Yep! by Scott's L.A. Audio CD Tours]&lt;/ref&gt; A widely accepted story is that they were part of the stock that were set free for their survival from the large pet emporium at Simpson's Garden Town on East Colorado Boulevard, which burned down in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;par&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot;&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=119786&amp;page=1 Wild Parrots Crowd Other Birds in L.A. - ABC News]&lt;/ref&gt;
