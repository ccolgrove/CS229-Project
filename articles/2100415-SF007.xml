'''Exact Audio Copy''' ('''EAC''') is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[Ripping|CD ripping]] [[Computer program|program]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. It has also been tested to work under newer versions of [[Wine (software)|Wine]] on [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iAppId=1190 Wine Application DB entry for EAC]&lt;/ref&gt; This program was created by Andre Wiethoff in 1998, while he was a student at the [[Dortmund University of Technology|University of Dortmund]] in [[Germany]], stating he became &quot;fed up with other audio grabbers&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audiomastermind.us/2006/03/10/exact-audio-copy/ |title=AudioMastermind Weblog|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080626030539/http://www.audiomastermind.us/2006/03/10/exact-audio-copy/|archivedate=2008-06-26|accessdate=2011-03-26|publisher=audiomastermind.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and decided to develop his own.

The main differences between EAC and most other audio grabbers:
*It works with a new technology, reading audio CDs almost perfectly, even damaged or scratched CD's{{fact|date=December 2011}}
*It successfully reads all the disc, including the [[pregap]] which most other software normally ignores.
*It allows users to set up profiles that allow for individual preferences, encoding in different formats, etc.

If there are any errors that can't be corrected, the software tells the user which time position the (possible) distortion occurred, so they could easily control it with, for example, the media player.

EAC is used to convert the tracks on standard audio CD's to [[WAV]] files, which can then be transcoded into other formats. These include lossy ones such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], or lossless ones such as [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]], [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], or [[WavPack]] using external encoders. It also has the option of using the Windows Audio Compression Manager (ACM Codecs) for direct compression. It supports AccurateRip (automatically comparing the copy with those rips made by others)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuraterip.com/ AccurateRip]&lt;/ref&gt; and can automatically create [[Cue sheet (computing)|Cue Sheets]], with all gaps, track attributes, [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]], and [[CD-Text]] included. EAC also supports automatic ID3 tagging using Internet-based databases such as [[Freedb|freedb]], GD3 (see below), or a local database.

With the release of 1.0b1, EAC supported the downloading of CD cover art, and in b2, an option was added to have the ID3 information, such as artist, CD title, track names, and cover art downloaded automatically from the GD3 database. The GD3 option allowed a user who set up an account to make 10 free initial queries, but afterwards, required them to pay a one-time fee of $7.99, after which they were allowed to make an unlimited number of queries.

Exact Audio Copy is [[freeware]], free for [[non-commercial]] use&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exactaudiocopy.de/en/index.php/resources/registration/ Registration Information]&lt;/ref&gt; and highly popular among [[audiophile]]s for its high accuracy and ability to rip severely damaged audio [[compact disc]]s.
