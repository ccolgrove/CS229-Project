A '''cantenna''' is a directional [[waveguide]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] for long-range [[Wi-Fi]] used to increase the range of (or discover) a wireless network.

== Origin of the name==
[[Image:Cantenna.JPG|thumb|right|100px|Cantenna (in this case a paint can) [[dummy load]] suitable up to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz and up to 1&amp;nbsp;kW]]
The term &quot;Cantenna&quot; originally referred to a product sold by [[Heathkit|Heathkit Co]]. in [[Benton Harbor, MI]], [[USA]].  It was a 50&amp;nbsp;ohm resistive load used by radio amateurs.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Chuck. (May 1984). &quot;Heathkit Cantenna, Model HN-31A&quot;. ''QST''. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the more casual vernacular of the Do-It-Yourself community, it has functionally become a [[portmanteau]] of ''can'' (e.g. an empty Pringles can, see below) and ''antenna'', since the device is used to broadcast (and receive) signals, and not just terminate them.

==Construction==
Although some designs are based on a [[Pringles]] potato chip can, in reality this tube is too narrow to be practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PC FAQ's: Build a 'Cantenna' Aerial|url=http://www.pelaginox.com/pc/pc-cantenna.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080411034630/http://www.pelaginox.com/pc/pc-cantenna.html|archivedate=2008-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a cantenna can be made from various cans or tubes of an appropriate diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saunalahti.fi/elepal/antenna2.html Wlan antenna Waveguide type (includes table of suitable dimensions for cantenna)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some designs include a pole mount to elevate the cantenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mali.geekcorps.org/2005/11/07/how-to-make-a-bottlenet-antenna/ Cantenna build on a pole (includes construction plans)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz, losses can occur if the cable from the cantenna to the Wi-Fi circuitry is too long. A more efficient cantenna can be made by minimising this length or connecting the cantenna directly to the Wi-Fi circuitry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amateurlogic.com/blog/?p=15 Amateurlogic Episode 3 (Construction details for a more efficient cantenna)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

* While cantennas are useful for extending a [[wireless local area network]] (WLAN), the tiny design makes them ideal for mobile applications such as [[wardriving]].  The design of the cantenna is so simple that it is often the first antenna Wi-Fi experimenters learn to build.
* Cantennas can be used to increase cell phone range,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2006/10/cell-phone-cantenna-diagr.html MAKE: Blog: Cell phone - Cantenna diagram and parts list&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; improve reception, and decrease noise.
* A cantenna can be used as a [[satellite dish]] [[feed horn]]. The 5.5&amp;nbsp;GHz cantenna dimensions are almost perfect in that they make a perfect fit for the standard TV [[satellite dish]]. The resulting setup is a low-cost high-quality high-gain antenna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pwmn.net/wiki/index.php/How_to_make_5ghz_cantenna_-_feeder_for_sat-dish 5.5 GHz cantenna as a satellite dish feed]&lt;/ref&gt; Such setups are widely used in [[wireless community network]]s for long-distance Wi-Fi links.
* Cantennas may be used with other RF devices such as wireless security cameras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cantenna.com/CantennaUserGuide.pdf Cantenna.com User Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
