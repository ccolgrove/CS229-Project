The largest campus is located in St. John's. [[Parkway (St. John's)|Prince Philip Drive]] runs east-west through the main campus, with Westerland Road bordering it to the west, Elizabeth Avenue to the south and Allandale Road to the east. The majority of the academic buildings are located south of Prince Philip Drive; the Arts and Administration building, Science building, Chemistry and Physics, Mathematics, Music, Education, Physical Education and the Bruneau Centre for Research and Innovation.

==History==

Memorial University of Newfoundland is a non-denominational university in [[St John's, Newfoundland]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0002335 Memorial University of Newfoundland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial University began as Memorial University College (MUC), which opened in September 1925 at a campus on Parade Street in St. John's.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

The first president was J. L. Paton. It offered the first two years of university studies. MUC's initial enrollment was 57 students, rising to a peak of over 400 in the 1940s. In 1933 it merged with the adjacent Normal School and took responsibility for teacher training. During the College's early years it received considerable support from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]].

The college was established as a memorial to the Newfoundlanders who had lost their lives on active service during the First World War.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; It was later rededicated to also encompass the province's war dead of the Second World War.&lt;ref name=MUNHistory&gt;{{cite web

The post-Confederation government elevated the status of Memorial University College to full university status in August 1949, renaming the institution to Memorial University of Newfoundland.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Memorial University was established by the Memorial University Act.&lt;ref&gt;assembly.nl.ca/Legislation/sr/statutes/m07.htm Memorial University Act&lt;/ref&gt;

The enrollment in MUN's first year was 307 students. In 1961, enrollment having increased to 1400, MUN moved from Parade Street to its present location on Elizabeth Avenue (Main Campus).
&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On8 March 1965, the government of Newfoundland announced free tuition for first year students enrolled at Memorial University in St. John's. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Faculty of Medicine of Memorial University of Newfoundland]] was established in 1967, and the first students were admitted in 1969. It admits approximately 60 students into the M.D. program each year, and also offers M.Sc. and Ph.D. programs.

MUN maintains a campus in [[Harlow]], England which opened to students in 1969. This campus has been a popular location for internships in Education, and now offers credit courses, work terms, and internships in a number of areas. The campus accommodates approximately 50 students.

Memorial established the Institut Frecker in [[St. Pierre and Miquelon|St. Pierre]] in 1973, to offer one-semester French immersion programs. It was housed in a building provided by the archdiocese of St. Pierre until 2000. Now known as the Programme Frecker, it is currently run from the [[FrancoForum]], a language teaching facility owned by the government of St. Pierre. The program is partly supported by the governments of Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador.

In September 1975 a campus was opened in [[Corner Brook, Newfoundland and Labrador|Corner Brook]]; it was first renamed [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in 1979 and renamed again in 2010 as [[Grenfell Campus, Memorial University of Newfoundland]].  Currently 1300 students attend Grenfell, which offers full degree programs in several disciplines, including Fine Arts, and partial programs, which can be completed at the main campus, in many other subjects.

The university operates the [[Bonne Bay Marine Station]] in [[Gros Morne National Park]].

==Motto, shield, and arms==

The shield of arms bears a representation of the sea, books, and a cross.  The Arms of Memorial University have as their central element a [[Cross (heraldry)|cross moline]], which is a fitting symbol for an institution dedicated to the memory of soldiers of Newfoundland who died during the Great Wars.
