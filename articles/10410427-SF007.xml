'''Partimage''' is a [[disk cloning]] utility for [[Linux]]/[[UNIX]] environments. Partimage can save [[disk partitioning|partitions]] in many formats to a [[disk image]]. Utilities such as Partimage are useful in a number of situations which are commonly encountered by network administrators as well as advanced computer users who maintain their own systems.

== Common Uses ==
Some common uses for Partimage are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debianadmin.com/backup-and-restore-linux-partitions-using-partimage.html Backup and Restore Linux Partitions Using Partimage - Debian Admin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Backup]] of individual disk partitions. [[Volume (computing)|volume]] backups are very useful for recovery in the case of a disk failure or data corruption.
* Large-scale operating system deployment. Organizations with multiple, similar computer systems may use Partimage or similar utilities to ease the process of [[operating system]] and [[software]] [[provisioning]].

== Features ==
For [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] users, Partimage includes experimental support for [[NTFS]]. Partimage supports most common Linux [[file systems]], and can be found in many [[Linux distribution]]s, including [[Debian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/partimage Debian Partimage]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Live Distro]]s PING,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ping.windowsdream.com/ping/download.html PING Partimage]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knoppix]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kernel.org/pub/dist/knoppix/packages.txt Knoppix Partimage]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SystemRescueCD]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sysresccd.org/Detailed-packages-list SystemRescueCD Partimage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable features include [[data compression|compression]] of disk image files, support for backup/restore from a network file server and data [[encryption]].

Partimage uses [[Newt (programming library)|Newt]] for its GUI.

Partimage is limited to cloning partitions that have supported filesystem types. This includes [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Reiserfs]], [[Fat16]], [[Fat32]], [[HPFS]], [[JFS (file system)|JFS]], [[Xfs]], [[Unix file system|UFS]], [[Hierarchical File System|HFS]] and [[Ntfs]]. Partimage does NOT support [[Ext4]] which is the default on new Ubuntu installations.
