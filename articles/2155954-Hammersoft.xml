The '''Municipality of Sogod''' (pronounced {{IPA-tl|sugud|}} [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]: ''Lungsod sa Sogod'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''Bayan ng Sogod'', [[Waray-Waray language|Waray]]: ''Bungto han Sogod'') is a 2nd class [[Philippine municipality|municipality]] in the [[Philippine province|province]] of [[Southern Leyte province|Southern Leyte]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/municipality.asp?muncode=086417000&amp;regcode=08&amp;provcode=64.html|title= Sogod's Municipal Information|date= August 1, 2007|publisher= nscb.gov.ph|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sogod is connected in the [[Maharlika Highway|Maharlika Highway (AH26)]] that links [[Luzon]] to [[Mindanao]], one of the most important highways in the [[Philippines]]. It is located seventy-two (72) kilometers northeast of [[Maasin City]], the capital city of the province, one hundred twenty-six (126) kilometers south of [[Tacloban City]], the regional center of [[Eastern Visayas]], twenty-four (24) kilometers north of [[Liloan, Southern Leyte|Liloan]], a major port town that connects [[Surigao City]], and thirty-six (36) kilometers east of [[Hilongos, Leyte|Hilongos]], another major port town in the province of [[Leyte]]. It is the largest municipality in the province encompassing a total land area of 23,690 hectares or about 236.9 square kilometers followed by the [[Maasin City|City of Maasin]] having a total area of 21,165.8 hectares or 211.7 square kilometers. The name of the municipality means &quot;to start&quot;, from the Cebuano word, '''''sogod''''', a fitting name for the municipality as it is experiencing a massive economic growth since the establishment of many industries. According to the 2007 National Statistics Office (NSO) census, it has a population of 39,864 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Statistics Office&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html|title= Total Population by Province, City, Municipality and Barangay as of August 1, 2007 (Southern Leyte)|date= August 1, 2007|publisher= National Statistics Office|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its varied landscape is composed of rugged mountain ranges in the northern portion and a flat-plained terrain in the center and southern areas of the municipality. The town has numerous river and creek systems suitable for agriculture it produces rice, corn, copra, tobacco, abaca and root crops. The mining and quarrying business in the [[Subangdaku River]] provides the town with an efficient supply of gravel and sand, which are either exported domestically to other neighboring provinces.

The municipality is home to [[Southern Leyte State University]] (SLSU) Main Campus, a premier and foremost state university in the province of [[Southern Leyte]], the [[Saint Thomas Aquinas College (Sogod)|Saint Thomas Aquinas College (STAC)]], one of the oldest and leading catholic institutions in the province and in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Maasin]] that served the community since January 6, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas College Pupil's Handbook|year= 2006|publisher= Saint Thomas Aquinas College (SOGOD)|location= Sogod, Southern Leyte|page= 3|accessdate=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It houses the Agas-Agas Bridge, the country's tallest bridge. It measures thirty (30) stories high or two hundred ninety-two (292) feet above ground. The bridge houses the longest and only zipline in [[Eastern Visayas]] in the length of eight hundred eighty (880) meters, established by the province as a tourist attraction. This bridge is by far the tallest pier or column that involves the construction of a three hundred fifty (350) linear meter bridge, with a mix of steel and concrete, supported by two (2) piers from the ground.

Within the bay, the town is the center for trade, commerce and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=706718.html|title= Sogod|date= September 28, 2008|publisher= skyscrapercity.com|accessdate= May 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
=== Location and Land Area ===

[[Image:Poblacion Sogod as seen from the town of Bontoc.JPG|350px|left|thumb|Poblacion Sogod as seen from the town of Bontoc.]]

The municipality of Sogod covers 23,690&amp;nbsp;hectares or about 236.9 square kilometers in land area. It is situated in the northern portion of the province of Southern Leyte and in the south-central side of [[Leyte]] Island, facing the Sogod Bay. It is located 10Â°23â10 North Longitude and 124Â°58â48 East Latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.travelmath.com/city/Sogod,+Philippines.html|title= Longitude and Latitude of Sogod|publisher= travelmath.com|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town belongs to the province of [[Southern Leyte]]. It is approximately seventy-two kilometers (72) from the City of Maasin, the provincial capital of Southern Leyte; one hundred twenty-seven (127) kilometers from [[Tacloban City]], the regional centre of [[Eastern Visayas]] and the provincial capital of [[Leyte]]; one hundred six kilometers (106) from [[Ormoc City]], the major entry of point of Leyte.

The town is bounded on the north by the municipality of [[Mahaplag, Leyte]], approximately thirty-eight (38) kilometers northbound via the [[Maharlika Highway]]; in the east are the municipalities of [[Silago]], [[Hinunangan]], and some portion of the municipality [[Saint Bernard, Southern Leyte|Saint Bernard]]; in the southeast is the municipality of [[Libagon]], about twenty-two (22) kilometers eastbound via the [[maharlika highway|national highway]]; facing to the south is Sogod Bay, the only water form that divides the [[province]] from west to east; monitoring six (6) kilometers southwest bound lies the municipality of [[Bontoc, Southern Leyte|Bontoc]]; in the west are the towns of [[Hindang]], [[Hilongos]], and several portion of the municipalities of [[Bato, Leyte|Bato]] and [[Inopacan]].

It is either bounded by mountain ranges, rivers, creeks, and irrigation canals that run thru the municipality. In the north, the Mahaplag-Sogod boundary line is the provincial boundary line that separates the two provinces: [[Leyte]] and [[Southern Leyte]], wherein the mountain slopes serves as a line. In Barangay Kahupian (particularly at Sitio Balintulay), passing by the Agas-Agas Bridge, are two bridges that links Sogod and [[Mahaplag, Leyte]]. Beneath these bridges are deep ravenous ridges that are made as a boundary for the two provinces and its people. In the east and west sides of the municipality are much similar to the north side, the mountain slopes serves also barricades from the other municipalities. However, some mountain roads are passable and people from these [[hinterlands]] are using these pivotal roads in order to bargain and trade their produce. In the southern part is bounded by rivers and creeks, wherein Santa Cruz creek serves as demarcation line bounded by the municipality of Bontoc and Gakat creek on the southeastern side of the town.

=== Topography ===

[[Image:Rice Fields from the outskirts of Sogod.JPG|350px|left|thumb|Rice paddies in Barangay Salvacion with the Abuyog-Liloan Cordillera in the background.]]

Sogod has mostly plains in the southern portion, making the land suitable for agriculture with rivers abound in the municipality. The most prominent ones are the [[Subangdaku River]], which is situated in the central portion and considered as hazardous, and the other one is the San Francisco River, the river that is the major channel for the Subangdaku Riverâs sustenance. Its source is found somewhere in the municipalities of [[Abuyog, Leyte]] and [[Mahaplag, Leyte]] where it is an extension of the Layug River that leads to [[Mahaplag]] town and the Cadac-an River of Abuyog town, where is it the mouth of these rivers in the north. Eventually, hard rains contribute to the connection of Subangdaku River and Maag River in the municipality of [[Silago, Southern Leyte]].

While rivers are abundant in the municipality, springs or ''tubod'' are literally found in the municipality. Mostly it is found on the barrios, which supplies the water they need for household purposes. The Magaupas Spring in Barangay Pandan and the Banat-e Spring in Barangay San Pedro are the sources of freshwater of the Sogod Water District (SWD), the local distributor of freshwater in Sogod Town Proper.

In the northern part are mountain slopes that are dotted with thick rain forests and serves as a habitat for rare species of [[flora]] and [[fauna]].There are three mountain ranges that separates the municipality from the other towns, these are: [[Baybay]] to [[Maasin]] [[Cordillera]], the [[Abuyog]] to [[Liloan, Southern Leyte|Liloan]] Cordillera and [[Mahaplag]] Mountain range. The [[Baybay]] to [[Maasin]] Cordillera are relatively scattered hills with high mountains situated on the Baybay-Hindang portion and it has varied upland plains, which is inhabited by the locals. The Abuyog to Liloan [[Cordillera]] is somehow different and remote. It is mountainous and somehow regarded as the bounty for endangered animals such as the [[tarsier]]s, eagles, deers, monkeys, and others. The mountain range has an altitude of about 2,000 above sea level. It houses the Sogod rainforest, a vast area that is being exploited by loggers because of lumber. Due to massive timber cutting, it caused severe flowing of the [[Subangdaku River]] and mudslides to the nearby communities that surrounds the mountainous joint of the municipality. In mid-1980s, the [[Philippine Government]] issued the banning of timber cutting in the entire country, leading to the massive restoration of the forests in the country including Eastern Visayas. Now, the mountains and its environs are slowly restoring its virgin forest by reforestation projects headed by the Local Government Units ([[Local government|LGU]]) and [[non-government organizations]] (NGO). The Mahaplag Cordillera is an arm of the Abuyog to Liloan Mountain Range and has the same characteristics with the other mountain ranges. Because of the dense forest and isolated by human activities, it is also home to other species of flora and fauna. But, however, the [[New Peopleâs Army]], a communist separatist group that is reckoning havoc since the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] era, is actively operating and took camp in the vast hinterlands of the area.

The coastline of Sogod is characterized by black sands on the southeastern portion and in the southwestern side are pebbles and rocks that cover the entire ''poblacion''. However, the length of the coastline of Sogod is small, the bay that surrounds the province is named after the municipality because the town is centrally located at the heart of the bay.

'''Subangdaku River'''
{{Main|Subangdaku River}}
[[File:Subang Daku River Barangay Suba, Sogod, Southern Leyte.JPG|350px|thumb|left|Subang Daku River]]
It is the townâs biggest river lying on the central part of the area that drains to the Sogod Bay. It is considered as the major drainage of the bay together with Divisoria River found in Barangay Divisoria, [[Bontoc, Southern Leyte|Bontoc]] town.

For years, following the floodings of the river, it created an issue over the province. It has been quarried and rechanneled which caused the incidents. After many attempts, the issue remained unsolved.

By description, it can be considered a braided river composed of several channels from near areas that divide and reunite forming an alluvial fan with very wide floodplain. As such, the river usually became hazardous during typhoon after a heavy rain.&lt;ref name=Inecar&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20091026230001/http://geocities.com/sogodbay/Inecar.html Inercar Paper]&lt;/ref&gt; The river sometime overflows spilling its waters on the low-lying barangays of San Juan and San Vicente and destroyed an ongoing flood control project worth millions of pesos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samarnews.com/News_clips/news5.htm Southern Leyte-News on Samar 5]&lt;/ref&gt; The river has been known to meander along its course, ever changing its way over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pia.gov.ph/Default.asp?m=11&amp;sec=archive&amp;r=ALL&amp;sp=10&amp;fi=p061004.htm&amp;no=27 PIA Information Services - Philippine Information Agency] {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the time itâs flooding, it destructs every side of its course. In 2001, portion of the road and banks in Barangay San Miguel along the river have been destroyed.&lt;ref name=Inecar/&gt; It hampered the economic activities of the local residents as well as national because the destroyed portion is part of the Philippine National Road. The local officials blamed the rechannelization and uncontrolled quarrying of gravel and sand at the side of river as the cause of the flood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news01_dec21_2003 Manila Standard: The Future is Ours] {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a meeting on March 18, 2002, one of the representatives of a government agency alleged that the reason of the incidents of flood and other environmental problems in the river was due to the [[Philippine Fault System]] which caused rocks to rumble down. However, the reason was contended because the fault is a geological feature and environmental problems in the province just occurred that time.&lt;ref name=Inecar/&gt;

In 2007, Governor Damian Mercado and Congressman Roger Mercado, together with Mayor Sheffered Tan, order the complete rechannelization of the river with dikes to protect the barangays that touches the river namely: Suba, San Isidro, San Miguel and Concepcion, following to the plans of former Governor Rossette Yniguez-Lerias to rehabilitate the said river. Today, the dike is not strong enough to maintain the wild rage of the course of the river, although it stands but the foundation of the dike is weak and it is made of rocks that are concreted and formed into a barricade against the river (grouted riffraff).

An irrigation dam was constructed beneath the mighty Subangdaku River, to control the flow of the current to the farmlands in the southeastern portion of the municipality. It was destroyed during hard rains occurred last January 2011.

=== Climate ===
[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is throughout the year making [[agriculture]] favorable. Two climate conditions exist: Type D, which is characterized by rainfall more or less evenly distributed all year round and Type E, with no dry season and a very pronounced maximum [[rainfall]] from November to January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Climate (Southern Leyte)|last= Chong|first= Joaquin|year= 1995|location= Maasin City, Southern Leyte|page= 17|accessdate= May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Type E affects the eastern part of Sogod and Type D affects the western part of Sogod. The Subangdaku River is a dividing line between the two climate conditions.

=== Political Subdivision ===

[[File:Sogod Municipal Hall - June 2011.JPG|420px|thumb|right|Sogod Municipal Hall (will be replaced by a new municipal building)]]

The ''[[barangay]]'' (ward/district) plays a pivotal role as the planning and implementing unit of government policies, programs and activities. Each barangay is led and governed by its Barangay Officials. The Barangay considered as a Local Government Unit (LGU) same as the Provincial and the Municipal Government. It is composed of a ''Punong Barangay'' (Barangay Captain/Chairman/Chief), a ''[[Sangguniang Barangay]]'' (Barangay Council) with seven ''[[Barangay Kagawad]]s'' (Barangay Councilors) who are all duly elected by their constituents, and a ''[[Sangguniang Kabataan]]'' (Youth Council) Chairman afforded with full membership status in the Council after being duly elected but only by the barangay's youth sector. Thus, there are eight members of the [[Legislative Council]] in a barangay. Each [[Kagawad]] has his/her own respective Committee where he/she is the chairperson. Three members are appointed to carry out the functions of each committee. Below are the committees in the Barangay Council:

# Peace and Order Committee,
# Appropriations, Finance and Ways and Means Committee,
# Education Committee,
# Health Committee,
# Agriculture Committee,
# Tourism Committee,
# Infrastructure Committee, and
# Youth and Sports Committee.

Sogod is politically subdivided into forty-five (45) barangays or ''barrios''. Of the forty-five [[barangays]], ten barangays are within the poblacion (town proper) while thirty-five barangays are situated in the rustic countryside. The ''[[Poblacion]]'' of Sogod comprises the Barangays of Rizal, San Jose, San Pedro, San Roque, Tampoong, Zone I, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV and Zone V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wikimapia.org/#lat=10.3870469&amp;lon=124.9823356&amp;z=16&amp;l=0&amp;m=b.html|title= Location of Poblacion Sogod|publisher= wikimapia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest barangay in the municipality is Kahupian. Barangay Kahupian, like many other barrios in the municipality, is rustic and sleepy. However, it is the bulk of the ''[[abaca]]'' and ''[[copra]]'' businesses, together with the mountain barrios in the northern portion of the municipality. The Manila hemp or ''abaca'' is a strong fiber from the leafstalks of a banana plant. It is exported to other countries because it is used as ropes and papers. While the ''[[copra]]'' is the dried coconut shell and it is extracted into [[coconut oil]], which is very useful to humans. The ''barrio'' is also famous for the Agas-Agas Bridge, the highest bridge in the Philippines. Barangay Kahupian has a total population of about 1,400 individuals, each distributed in six sitios, namely: Balintulay, Centro, Hagna, Kabernal, Lubong Sapa, and Silao Bato. Other larger barangays are San Francisco Mabuhay, Hipantag, Kauswagan, Javier, Hindangan and Magatas. The said barangays, except Barangay Javier, are found on the mountainous part of Sogod and are isolated or separated from the other barangays due to the distance and location of the barrio proper.

Barangay Zone IV, found at the centermost part of the ''[[poblacion]]'', ranks as the smallest. The barangay is home to 500 individuals. It is classified as the residential and commercial zone of the municipality. In the barangay resides the Sogod Auditorium, the ''[[Sangguniang Bayan]]'' Session Hall, the Vice Mayorâs office and other government offices that are equidistant to the present municipal hall, which is under the jurisdiction of Barangay Zone I. Most of the smaller barangays are found in the densely populated areas in the municipality, particularly in the poblacion and in the southeastern part of the municipality.

These are the barangays or barrios that constitute the Municipality of Sogod:&lt;ref name=&quot;National Statistics Office&quot;/&gt;

Through his efforts, it was named '''''âFrancisco Mabuhayâ'''''. Since, the people are mainly Catholics and are religious in nature; they put the '''''âSanâ''''' ([[Saint]] or Holy) before the name of the barangay.

[[File:Sogod New Public Market.JPG|350px|right|thumb|Sogod Integrated Public Market]]

While ethnicity of the municipality is widely [[Cebuanos]], Boholanos and Surigaonons (locally prefer as Bisaya), most people in Sogod are farmers and fisherfolks. Minorities include the Tagalogs and the Warays are also found within the municipality.

Generally, rice is the staple food of the province and also includes corn. Mountain living folks, however, prefer root crops which is abundant in the place. Native delicacies of the municipality include ''tres marias'', ''suman'', ''bocarillo'', ''salvaro'', ''bibingka'', ''ampaw'', ''puto'', ''biko'', ''bibingka'', ''empanada'', and ''starhoy''. They also have their own ''kinilaw'', a Filipino ceviche made with raw fish cubed and marinated in vinegar or Calamansi (lemon) juice along with garlic, onions, ginger, tomato and various peppers.

The town has a total population of about 40,064 individuals, registered in the Sogod District Hospital. But as of 2007 National Statistics Office (NSO) Census, the municipality of Sogod has 39,864 inhabitants. The town ranks second, after the [[Maasin City|City of Maasin]], in terms of population in the province of [[Southern Leyte]].

Within the municipality, Barangay Zone V registered as the highest population of about 3,382 inhabitants, followed by Barangay Zone III and Barangay Maac with the population of 1,934 inhabitants and 1,869 inhabitants, respectively.

But the barangay with the lowest population is Barangay Lum-an ,having a population of only 90 individuals; followed by Barangay Hindangan and Barangay Buac Daku with the population of 116 individuals and 119 individuals.

The town is also suffering from [[Human migration|population migration]] because of the massive economic progress in the municipality. Rustic barangays, mostly found in the hinterlands, are now experiencing a decrease in their population rate because of the lack of progress in their communities and migrated to the town proper.

=== Language and Literacy ===
The native language is [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] and the major language spoken in the municipality. The speech variety however used by the people has also Boholano ''(Bol-anon)'' influences because of its proximity with the province Bohol. Some Sogodnons also used the Surigaonon dialect with mixed Boholano variety, those having a Surigaonon lineage. Furthermore, [[Waray-Waray language|Waray-Waray]] is spoken as a secondary language. Natives also understood foreign languages such as [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

=== Religion ===
The majority of the population of Sogod belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with a percentage of about 93% of the total population. 7% adheres to other Protestant sects and some Muslim followers. The Catholics built their own church around mid 1600s by the Jesuit Fathers and later the light of Christianity in the whole municipality arose when it was established as a mission in 1720. Priests were served from the mother parish of [[Malitbog, Southern Leyte|Malitbog]], [[San Juan, Southern Leyte|San Juan]], [[Hilongos]] and [[Maasin]]. The present church, which was constructed on 1960s, is one of the largest churches in the whole [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Maasin]]. Sogod is considered as the bulk or the stronghold of the Catholic faith in the whole province because of its large number of adherents, despite of the growing proliferation of the Protestant faiths.

Protestant churches such as the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[United Church of Christ in the Philippines]] ([[United Church of Christ in the Philippines|UCCP]]), [[Iglesia Ni Cristo]] ([[Iglesia ni Cristo|INC]]), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] ([[Mormons]]), [[Members Church of God International|Church of God International]] ''([[Ang Dating Daan]])'', Filipino Crusaders World Army (Moncados), [[Baptist Church]], [[Jehovahâs Witnesses]], Church of Christ, Sogod Alliance Church, [[Assembly of God]] (AG) and others, set and maintain their churches in christening the town. The [[Protestants]] are active in areas which are far from the town proper and in the hinterlands. [[Muslim]]s are present in the town, but their number for the past years gradually decreased because their [[mosque]] and homes were demolished and regarded as [[squatters]].

Every [[barangay]] and [[sitio]] has its own [[Roman Catholic]] [[chapel]] aside from the [[parish church]] in the ''[[Poblacion]]'' (Town Proper) and in Barangay Consolacion. The municipality is under the [[patronage]] of the [[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception]], which the Sogodnons celebrated her feast day on every 15 December. Sogod parish is the seat of the Vicariate of the [[Immaculate Conception]], which is composed of six parishes ([[Bontoc, Southern Leyte|Bontoc]], Barangay Consolacion, Barangay Divisoria, [[Libagon]], Sogod and [[Tomas Oppus]] parishes). The Consolacion parish was created on 1967, under the patronage of the Holy Child Jesus ''([[Santo NiÃ±o de Cebu|Santo NiÃ±o]])'' and celebrates their fiesta on every Last Saturday of January. (Atoy Manlunas III (NORTHERNHASHBERRY) - October 17, 2010)

=== Tradition ===
'''Beliefs'''&lt;br /&gt;
Although most people are [[Christians]], a very few who live in remote villages of the municipality hold-on to [[Pre-Hispanic]] influences in making offerings and sacrifices before planting their crops. Farmers ritually sacrifice chickens and pigs to ensure that the spirits or elementals which they believe to be the cause of good harvest will grant them.

'''Religious Events'''&lt;br /&gt;
Fiesta, a Spanish term which means festivity, is celebrated in the municipality with prayer, food/drinking, dance and music. Every barangay in the town have their own distinct date of celebration. Sogod pays homage to the patroness, [[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception]], every 14th and 15 December.

== Catholicism in Sogod ==
{{See also|Roman Catholic Diocese of Maasin}}
[[Catholicism]] is a deeply rooted institution in this municipality within 93% of the entire population of Sogod embracing the faith. Hence, Sogod is predominantly [[Roman Catholic]]. While 7% belongs to other Protestant sects and a small Muslim minority. In May 8, 2011, the Diocese of Maasin are appointing the priests to their respected assignments. Reverend Monsignor Nestor S. Astillo, PC, Reverend Father Pepito Generan Jr., assistant parish priest; Reverend Father Wilson Delos Reyes are the new [[parish]] [[curate]], parochial [[vicar]] and resident priest of the Immaculate Conception Parish of Sogod, respectively. In the Holy Child Parish of Barangay Consolacion, Reverend Father Jose Benito S. Labrador is currently the parish priest of the parish.

Sogod, under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Maasin since 1968, is divided into two parishes, namely:
* '''Holy Child Parish''', Barangay Consolacion
* '''Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Parish''', Barangay Rizal

=== Holy Child Parish of Barangay Consolacion ===

[[File:Holy Child Parish - Barangay Consolacion, Sogod, Southern Leyte.JPG|left|350px|thumb|Holy Child Parish]]

Barangay Consolacion is one of the oldest existing ''barrios'' in the municipality of Sogod, established in '''February 3, 1730''' as a village. The ''barrioâs'' primitive name is ''âMaakâ'', comes from the word ''âMaaâ'', signifying water fault as the river ceased to pass through the village. Maak was one of the mother barangays among several ''barrios'' located along the southern shore of the municipality. It includes Barangays Consolacion, Salvacion, Mahayahay, Javier and Maac itself. The area of the barangay was reduced to its present form due to the clamor of the people in the sitios to become an independent barangays. First, when the people from Maak proper agitated for a new name for their barangay. But when the people from Maak proper choose the name ''âConsolacionâ'', the people from the eastern side refused to organized and negotiate from the people living in the proper because they want ''âMaakâ'' to be the maiden name of the place. Thus, the name ''âConsolacionâ'' was stuck. However, the people from Maak proper changed the name of their ''barrio'' into ''Consolacion''. As years pass by, people from the eastern side of the ''barrio'' urges to have an independent ''barrio'' named after the original name of the place, Maak. After much determination of the ''barrio'' leaders together with the municipal government, the sitio was carved out from ''barrio'' Consolacion and named the ''barrio'', Maac. The letter âkâ of the named was dropped out and turned it into letter âCâ. Second, when Consolacion was again cut in half due to the growing needs of the people and perhaps its population or the size of the community. The metes and bounds of the new barangay were clear and the elementary and secondary schools are transferred to this barangay. Later, Barangay Salvacion was formed and declared as a ''barrio''. Now the ''barrio'' houses the current Consolacion Elementary School and Consolacion National High School.

After Maac regain its barangayhood from Consolacion, the ''barrio'' was later subdivided into two ''barrios'': Mahayahay and Maac. Barangay Maacâs area was gradually larger for sometime because the area of Barangay Mahayahay was small.

Then, Barangay Javier, named in honor of the late [[Daniel Falcon Javier]], was worn out from Barangay Maac. People from the western side of Barangay Maac were urging to have a separate barrio government. After sometime, it was passed on the congress and obtains its barrio status against Barangay Maac until it is declared as a separate barangay of Javier. However, a boundary dispute took place between Maac and Javier after a certain portion of the said bill was unclear. Immediately, the boundary dispute has been settled not long after the bill was passed.

Mano Daniel Javier is a teacher and principal of the Cebu Normal School (now known as [[Cebu Normal University]]). After his resignation, he went to [[Cabadbaran, Agusan del Norte]] where he used to farmed to his land and provide extensive farming activities to the people. He is also the fountainhead of making ''barrio'' Bugho in the town of [[Abuyog, Leyte]] progressive and led the people in community activities in the fields of health, education and agriculture. When he died on 1957, Bugho was raised into municipal status and renamed their town ''âJavierâ'' on December 1965.

Barangay Consolacion was said to be livelier, populous and progressive than Sogod. Like Sogod, it has a bustling port were boats ply from Cebu and Surigao and fish boats arrived together with their catch and sell it to the people. Because of the being progressive and the centermost ''barrio'' in the southeastern portion of the municipality, people from other places migrated and settle their business in the ''barrio''. Barangay Consolacion was designated as the ''poblacion'' of Sogod in 1904 when Ladislao Decenteceo was elected as mayor in the municipality. However, it was short-lived and upon the election of Vicente CariÃ±o as mayor in 1912, he restored the seat of government to Sogod proper. Nowadays, Barangay Consolacion has a total population of 1,200 inhabitants and just like other barrios in the province; it is progressive and productive but sleepy barrio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= (Holy Child Parish - Consolacion) Silver Anniversary Diocese of Maasin|year= 1993|publisher= Diocese of Maasin|location= Maasin City, Southern Leyte|page= 49|accessdate=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holy Child Parish of Consolacion, Sogod was established on '''1967''' by the Most Reverend Bishop Teotimo Pacis, [[Archdiocese of Palo]]. As of the 1993 census, the total Catholic population is 9,616.

At present, the Parish has maintained a number of mandated religious organizations which are active in the various fields of church apostolates, namely: [[Catholic Women's League]], Legion of Mary, Charismatic Renewal Movement, and ''cofradias'' ([[confraternities]]) like the ''Birhen sa Lourdes'' (Our Lady of Lourdes), ''Sagrada Corazon'' ([[Sacred Heart]]), ''Inahan sa Kanunayng Panabang'' ([[Our Lady of Perpetual Help]]), ''[[San Jose, California|San Jose]]'' ([[Saint Joseph]]) and ''[[San Antonio]]'' ([[Saint Anthony of Padua]]). Other organizations are the Knights of the [[Santo NiÃ±o de Cebu|Santo NiÃ±o]] (established by Reverend Father Oliver Edulan), [[Lay Ministers]], [[Catechist]], CF-LAMP, Parish Emergency Action Team and the Knights of the Altar.

Recently, the Parish embarked on a church-expansion program, a project initiated by Father Edulan and substantially aided by the Bishop of Maasin. A Project Committee has been organized to administer and oversee the project.

From September 1992 to March 1993, the Parish launched an intensive doctrinal and spiritual formation program through the Catholic Faith Lay Apostolic Movement of the Philippines. (CF-LAMP), a local group tasked of defending the Catholic faith from proselytizing sects. This program has brought about remarkable conversations especially among the nominal and indifferent Catholics that the effects have been dubbed balik-Simbahan. One of the fruits of this program is that the barrio faithful have also embarked on renovations and extensions of their respective chapels.

It is the hope of the parish to mold, form and activate small Christian communities so that they will ultimately become the images of Christ here on earth â that of a worshipping, evangelizing, and serving community.

=== Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish of Sogod ===

[[File:Our Lady of Immaculate Conception Parish - Sogod, Southern Leyte.JPG|left|350px|thumb|Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish (Under renovation)]]

âSOGODâ, Cebuano term meaning âto startâ and this word aptly describes this booming town located at the innermost part of the bay on the southern portion of Leyte Island.  One look at the map of the island, and one certainly cannot miss this town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedalino 1993 47&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Silver Anniversary Diocese of Maasin|last= Pedalino|first= Bong|year= 1993|publisher= Diocese of Maasin|location= Maasin City, Southern Leyte|page= 47|accessdate=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aptly so, because Sogod is where thousand start their journey to other parts of the [[archipelago]]. In other words, this town is a junction to many places.  One can take a ride to the capital town with ease, for buses and [[jeepneys]] go there by the hour.  You need to go to a regional office in [[Tacloban City]], and several buses a day can take you there.  The ferry terminal in [[Liloan, Southern Leyte|Liloan]] is just an hourâs ride away, and Mindanao is almost at the doorstep from there. A Trip to Manila is not a problem, for long-distance transport is available. Indeed, Sogod is a good place to start when one wants to go to somewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedalino 1993 47&quot;/&gt;

Demised Mariologists may turn in their graves, but the patroness of Sogod can also be said to be a Sogodnon.  For, technically speaking (may God allow the use of this phrase in His divine plan), ''Immaculada Concepcion'' speaks of the beginning of the Incarnation. The Blessed Virgin, chosen by God to become the Mother of his Son, is starting her earthly life through an âImmaculate Conceptionâ in her motherâs womb. Aptly chosen as the patroness of the parish as well by the community, indeed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedalino 1993 47&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Immaculate Conception Shrine.JPG|right|350px|thumb|Immaculate Conception Shrine]]

Of course, under the mantle of Our Lady, the Sogodnons have already begun their journey towards salvation.  It all began when the people of Sogod started building a church of light materials.  But Moro pirates, as legend tells it, razed the structure to the ground.  Unfazed, the people again started to build another church â now made of strong materials- and a watch tower.  The Moro invaders returned and burned and destroyed the church and the watch tower.  In spite of these tragedies, the people remained where they were. It is regarded as a test of faith to see their churches burned time and again, the Sogodnons transformed their community into a church with a capital C.  This community â Godâs people became a parish on '''May 14, 1866''' under the patronage of [[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception]] by virtue of a ''Real Aprobacion''. Another leg of the journey had been overcome.

The history of Sogod Parish seems to be an endless cycle of starts and beginnings (Even its present church building which was started in the early 1960s and considered one of the biggest in the diocese is still unfinished.)  But this is where one can find the charm of the place and its people. Undaunted by events that somehow destroy what they had begun, the Sogodnons can always be counted to rise up and start all over again. (Atoy Manlunas III (NORTHERNHASHBERRY) - October 17, 2010)

A view of Sogodâs history before the coming of the Spaniards may be termed as a âLost Horizonâ. This is due to the dearth of materials on his subject, and the little information we have at present comes from the testimonies of the early Spanish missionaries and chronicles whose works cannot be verified properly. Hence, the difficulty of making an exhaustive survey.

=== Etymology and Origins ===

[[File:The Old Baluarte - Sogod, Southern Leyte.JPG|350px|right|thumb|The ruins of the old ''Baluarte'' was used to safeguard the village of then ''Sugut'' from [[Moro people|Moro]] pirates.]]

Before it officially became a municipality in 1853, Sogod was already a trading center in the southern portion of [[Leyte Island]]. Natives of then Sugut village found a settlement near the banks of the great [[Subangdaku River]] in the enclaves of ''Seilani'' (present-day [[Southern Leyte province]]) in what the Spaniards named ''baluarte'' (Barangay Zone III, formerly known as ''[[San Lorenzo Ruiz]]'', named after the latterâs patron saint) which has retained its name until today, where the ruins of an old church and a [[watchtower]] can be found.

In 1543, during the era of Villalobos expedition, folks living in [[Abuyog, Leyte]] informed the navigators that a certain area in the southeastern part of the island lies a village named '''''Sugut'''''. It is although a thriving center of [[trade]] and [[commerce]], Chinese traders are frequently visiting the settlement and traded the natives with gold and slaves. This information was later confirmed when the [[Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1565 came to visit the country. It was described as a large and thickly populated village facing the island of Panaon. Seventeen years later, the Spanish chronicler Loarca noted that ''Sugut'' was one of the aboriginal villages in [[Leyte]], together with ''Cabalian'' ([[San Juan, Southern Leyte]]), ''Ormog'' ([[Ormoc City]]) and ''Tandaya'' ([[Carigara, Leyte]]). On September 6, 1571, Sogod became a part of the Spanish [[encomienda]] (commission).

The community was object to frequent Moro raids so that a ''baluarte'' (watchtower, its ruins still visible today) was built to warn villagers against the approach of the raiders. In such crisis, a colorful personality emerged â '''Datu Mangkaw'''. His real name was ''Bankaw'', the person who led the [[Leyte revolt]] in 1622 against the [[Spaniards]]. He was known as a net-fisherman. Already a fishing ground that it is today, Sogod then had houses clustered close to shore around the watchtower. Datu Mangkaw, an expert in the art of casting the net, laya, he could send out the casting net in a perfect circle in the sea. As the community grew bigger, the residents agitated for a name for their place. Meetings after meetings were held presided by Datu Mangkaw. But every time a meeting is ongoing, a shoal of fish would be seen by the subtle ripplings and dimplings of the surface or quick shifting shadow beneath the surface and the eyes of Datu Mangkaw kept stalking it, interfering with the meeting. Satisfying his unequalled fishermanâs instinct, he would leave the meeting unattended and his body language was being watched by the attendees, feasting their eyes on the artful slide of the feet of Datu Mangkaw so as not to disturb the surface, his eyes fixed on the school. Then, he shared his catch with the people for the asking, even by strangers. After which, shouts of '''''âSogod, sogodâ''''' (begin) would reconvene the meeting. Thus the word '''''âSOGODâ''''' became the name of the village then and the town as it is today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Southern Leyte (Book II - Towns)|last= Chong|first= Joaquin|year= 1996|location= Maasin City, Southern Leyte|pages= 50â51|accessdate=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Atoy Manlunas III (NORTHERNHASHBERRY) - October 17, 2010)

=== New Municipality ===
[[File:Official Seal of Sogod, Southern Leyte.gif|180px|left|thumb|Official Seal of the Municipality of Sogod]]
Sogod was founded by the Jesuit missionaries as a mission in '''1616'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/r8_leytesouth.html#sogod|title= Sogod's foundation by missionaries|publisher= http://www.admu.edu.ph|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at the baptism of Datu Mangkaw, the village chieftain and his household, that Father Fabricio Sersali laid the foundation of the [[Christian faith]] in Sogod.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Southern Leyte (Book II - Towns)|last= Chong|first= Joaquin|year= 1996|location= Maasin City, Southern Leyte|page= 51|accessdate=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A church of light materials was constructed near the seashore, and a mission was established and serviced by the [[Jesuits]] from [[Carigara]], [[Hilongos]] and [[Cabalian]] ''Residencias''. During the [[Muslim]] raids in 1603 and 1634, the church was burned and Father Ventura Barcena was brought as captive in [[Tawi-Tawi]]. In 1634, during a [[Moro people|Moro]] raid Father Francisco Lauzon was killed and Sogod was subject to frequent Moro raids as it faced Mindanao. Another incident occurred again on September 27, 1705, when the [[Moro people|Moros]] attack the seashore and killed Father Pedro Oriel. On account of this, the [[Jesuit missionaries]] in Cabalian (San Juan) undertook the construction of the concrete church and a watchtower in 1718 upon the order of Bishop Sebastian Faronda, Diocese of [[Cebu]] (now [[Archdiocese of Cebu]]. In 1720, the [[Jesuits]] formally assigned priests into the settlement together with the newly constructed watchtower and concrete church. These were razed to the ground and the ''Kampanang Bulaw'' (Golden Bell) was thrown into the rice fields when the Moros returned and raided Sogod in 1754.

Sogod was officially established as a ''barrio'' (district/ward) on '''May 18, 1700'''. Later it was incorporated as a ''barrio'' of [[Maasin]] in 1755. It was placed under the jurisdiction of [[Malitbog, Southern Leyte|Malitbog]] in 1768, after obtaining separation from [[Maasin]] and became an independent ''pueblo'' (municipality).

Through the efforts of the political leaders of Sogod, ''Buntuk'' ([[Bontoc, Southern Leyte|Bontoc]] town) and ''Maak'' (present-day Barangay Consolacion) led by Juan Cavales (Cabales), Antonio Prima, Enero Cegales (Segales), German Catajoy, Silverio Bilisa (Billesa), Juan Barcelon, Miguel Tubia and Juan Dagaas, Sogod became a fully pledged municipality by virtue of a [[decree]] signed by [[Governor-General]] Antonio de Urbiztondo on '''June 10, 1853'''. The first ''[[gobernadorcillo]]'' is Don Juan Cavales, which its leadership lasted for two years. On '''August 8, 1869''', thirteen year after its inauguration, Sogod was raised with a parochial status under the patronage of [[Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception]] by virtue of a ''Real Aprobacion'', an Episcopal decree dated '''May 14, 1866'''. Sogod was separated from the mother [[municipality]], Malitbog, in terms of parochial and municipal status. However, on 1886, Father Redondo reports that the church, which was made of light materials, and the ''convento'' were in the bad condition.

There are no remains of [[Jesuit]] architecture in Sogod. The old church traces to the initiative of the [[secular]] priest who built the church in the late 19th century. (Atoy Manlunas III (NORTHERNHASHBERRY) - October 17, 2010)

=== Governance ===

The newly created [[municipality]] was governed by duly elected ''[[gobernadorcillo]]s'' like:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Sogod, Southern Leyte: Then and Now|last= Gan|first= Edito|year= 1990|publisher= Sogod Local Government Units|location= Sogod, Southern Leyte|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1853â1855 â Don Juan Cavales

* 1858â1859 â Don Eulogio Cavales
* 1876â1878 â Don Patricio Tubia

However, when Don Nicolas Idjao became ''[[gobernadorcillo]]'' in 1885, he transferred the ''[[poblacion]]'' (seat of government) to the ''barrio'' of [[Libagon]], being a native to the place. The ''[[Poblacion]]'' (town proper) of Sogod then became ''Sogod Viejo'' (sometimes called ''Sogod Del Norte''), meaning Old Sogod and Libagon became ''Sogod Nuevo'' (sometimes called ''Sogod Del Sur''), meaning New Sogod. There the municipality was governed by:

* 1885â1887 â Don Nicolas Idjao
* 1887â1889 â Don Eleuterio Faelnar
* 1891â1893 â Don Luis Espina
* 1893â1895 â Don Nicolas Idjao
* 1895â1897 â Don Luis Espina

It was also during this time that the seat of the [[parish]] was transferred to [[Libagon]].

In 1903 to 1904, Don Benito Faelnar became the first ''Capitan Municipal'' (equivalent to present-day Mayor) of Sogod, the seat of government was transferred to Sogod.

When Capitan Ladislao Decenteceo took office on 1904, the seat of government was again transferred from Sogod to Barangay Consolacion. He was proclaimed winner after Faelnar run for re-election and lost. The voting process was done by whispering the name of a candidate of the voterâs choice to the municipal secretary. He served for 1904 to 1905.

In 1905, Capitan Dionisio Labata won from the first election of municipal president by balloting (replacing the Capitan Municipal), serving for 1905 to 1907. But on 1908, Capitan Gregorio Leviste replaced him and served the municipality from 1908 to 1911.

In 1912, upon the election of Vicente CariÃ±o as municipal president (the term ''âCapitan Municipalâ'' was defunct, after the arrival of the Americans and changed it to municipal president), the seat of government was restored to Sogod, being centrally located while Barangay Consolacion in the southern extreme of the municipality. On '''October 16, 1913''', Libagon was made an independent municipality, appointing the first municipal president of Libagon, Mariano Espina.

At Sogod:
* 1912â1916 â Don Vicente CariÃ±o
* 1917â1919 â Don Estanislao Flores
* 1920â1922 â Don Floro Espina
* 1923â1925 â Don Filomeno Mercado
* 1926â1931 â Don Gervacio Cadavos,
Governed the municipality after its return. Cadavos was later succeeded by Severino Macasocol, who due untimely death, served as mayor only for several months in 1941 to 1942. He was succeeded by:
* 1943â1944 â Hospicio Labata
* 1944â1947 â Francisco Villamor

During the forty years after the war, the mayors who served the municipality were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= (Mayors after the War) Sogod, Southern Leyte: Then and Now|last= Gan|first= Edito|year= 1990|publisher= Sogod Local Government Units|location= Sogod, Southern Leyte|accessdate=April 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1950â1951 â Cecilio Gonzales

On the 2004 Philippine General Elections, Shefferd Lino Siengco Tan won against the [[incumbent]] mayor, [[Physician|Doctor]] Edmundo Reyes Villa. During his term, the municipality undergoes multiple changes and become the leading progressive center in the province. Again, Tan was reelected as municipal mayor of Sogod in the 2007 elections, after a close-fisted fight against the opponent, Colonel George Rabusa, a resigned top military official that served the municipality for a couple of years. During those days, the municipality was appointed by the [[Commission on Elections]] ([[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|COMELEC]]) as âelection hotspotâ, because tensions abrupt between the two parties.

Tan was also running for reelection for the 2010 Philippine General Elections. Fortunately, he won a landslide victory against the former mayor, Ignacio âIgningâ Siega, to whom he served the town for twenty years. Siegaâs known development in the town during the Marcos regime was the improvement and building the first stable municipality hall which was made out of concrete and wood. This time, this is the third term where he is the mayor of Sogod, serving the municipality for three straight consecutive years (July 1, 2004-June 30, 2007; July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2010 and July 1, 2010 until present).

To date, Sogod has a total population of 40,064 distributed among forty-five (45) barangays on a land area of 23,690&amp;nbsp;hectares or 236.9 square kilometers. Being the center of [[Southern Leyte]] mainland, Sogod has become the link between Leyte province and the Pan-Philippine National Highway. The town has still an untapped economy which could contribute to its development as another commercio-industrial center giving socio-economic lifeblood to trade and culture in the [[Eastern Visayas Region]].

=== The Creation of the Municipality of Libagon ===
{{Main|Libagon, Southern Leyte}}
[[File:Official Seal of the Municipality of Libagon.jpg|160px|left|thumb|Official Seal of the Municipality of Libagon]]
The municipality of Libagon is a 4th class municipality in the province of Southern Leyte, having a total population of 14, 238, as of 2007.

Libagon is home to Mount Patag Daku, one of the frontier mountains of the province. The name âPatag Dakuâ comes from the two Cebuano words â Patag means flatland and Daku means wide, because in the top of the mountain is a plateau and its soil is fertile. The mountain is found at the northern portion of the municipality which describe as the hinterlands between the mountainous borders between the municipalities of Libagon and Saint Bernard. The mountain contains all the wild flora and faunas imaginable on the topics. The area covers a thousand hectares and characterizes half flat land and half gentle weltering hills with rivers and creeks glide down on a hillside and flow to a tributary winding down to the sea. Its economy is preserved. Access to the mountain paradise is being chartered to open its verdant plateau for tourism Wildlife Park, an Amazon Valley-like wilderness in Southern Leyte rimmed by scenic mountain ranges two (2) kilometers wide and five (5) kilometers long of unsullied wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Libagon - Patag Daku|last= Chong|first= Joaquin|year= 1995|location= Maasin City, Southern Leyte|page= (Book II) 26|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of the town comes from a small depression to the ground describe as ''âIbaongâ'', ''âLibaongâ'' or ''âLibagongâ'', which the name '''''&quot;Libagon&quot;''''' is its primitive name. Spanish authorities mistook reference to the ground fault on the land being tilled as the name of the place. Since that happening, the town is been known as âLibagonâ. The name âLibagonâ suits the townâs characteristics because of its wide flatlands which is a promising agricultural development area or as game or a tourist destination for its beauty and a suspicion of a volcano, which is an effect of eccentric earth vibration over the years. But there is no exact evidence on this suspicion as verified by the concerned agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Suspicion of a Volcano close to Libagon|last= Chong|first= Joaquin|year= 1995|location= Maasin City, Southern Leyte|page= (Book II) 26|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was a barrio of Sogod, together with Bontoc and Consolacion. In 1885, Nicolas Idjao was elected as ''gobernadorcillo'' and transferred the ''poblacion'' of Sogod to Libagon, twenty-two kilometers from Sogod. Then, he renamed Libagon as Sogod Nuevo or Sogod Del Norte while Sogod as Sogod Viejo or Sogod Del Sur. After twelve years of power, the poblacion was restored to Sogod for sometime when Benito Faelnar was appointed as capitan municipal. But on 1904, Ladislao Decenteceo was elected and transferred the ''poblacion'' to Barangay Consolacion, a barrio twelve (12) kilometers from Libagon. However on 1912, the poblacion was transferred to Sogod, when Vicente CariÃ±o took office in that year.

After much determination and time-after-time transfer of the ''poblacion'' of Sogod, Libagon was finally inaugurated as a municipality. On October 16, 1913, the Municipality of Libagon got separated from the municipality of Sogod with its new capitan municipal, Mariano Espina. Espina was a konsehal (councilor) during the Decenteceo administration and he was the fountainhead of creating Libagon a municipality.

Libagon is known of its Spanish style municipal hall building. Libagon is one of the places that can attract more tourists to the province. These spots are: Biasong Spring (Barangay Biasong), Pangi Black Sand Beach (Barangay Pangi), Endriga Beach Resort (Barangay Jubas), Uwan-Uwanan Waterfalls (Barangay Kawayan), ruins of the Old Pantalan (seaport; Barangay Jubas) and the old building of the Libagon Academy Foundation, Inc. (Barangay Jubas).

The municipality is known to be religious and famous towards the province because they have two annual fiestas in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary. One is the feast of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, the town patroness, which is celebrated every 8 December. Another is the feast of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which is regarded as the secondary patroness of the town and celebrated on every 16 July. These two (2) fiestas is greatly known because of the strong faith of the Libagonhons to their patrons and also known for its creative floral arrangement of their caros and the church's altar. The people's main sources of income are copra, abaca, farming, and fishing.

=== The Creation of the Municipality of Bontoc ===
{{Main|Bontoc, Southern Leyte}}
[[File:Official Seal of the Municipality of Bontoc.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Official Seal of the Municipality of Bontoc]]
The municipality of Bontoc has a total population 27,592 inhabitants in 5,303 households. The town houses the Southern Leyte State University â Bontoc Campus, which offers agricultural and industrial courses. Its inhabitants are closely related with its mother municipality, Sogod, because of its distance.

The town is named after a creek which is found at the center of Barangays Poblacion and Talisay. The former site of the town is in the area of what is known as âLungsodaanâ (Old Town) at Barangay Santo NiÃ±o where the present cemetery stands. But later, the townspeople transfer a kilometer northbound to its present site.

During the Japanese occupation, the town serves as the seat of resistance movement against the Japanese with its general headquarters in sitio Mamingaw, Barangay Banahaw and under the command of Colonel Ruperto K. Kangleon. Also, a small monument stands in front of Bontoc motor pool at sitio Trece, Barangay Santo NiÃ±o commemorating the annihilation of truckload of Japanese soldiers that patrol in the surrounding area.

After the inauguration of the municipality, Bontoc progressed and was tentatively classified as 3rd class âFâ in the province with an average annual budget of over P15,000. Also, the town boasts of its long stretch of rich alluvial plain, which is drained by the Salog and Divisoria Rivers. Because of its rich soil, the town is subjected to rice farming and considered as the greatest farming region in the entire Sogod Bay District. The town is also the producer of Abaca, Copra and Tobacco in the Bay District.

The town celebrates their fiesta in honor of the Holy Child Jesus. The Karatong Festival, held every 15 January, was done by colorful participants dancing in honor of the icon of the SeÃ±or Santo NiÃ±o (Holy Child Jesus). Some devotees to the SeÃ±or Santo NiÃ±o said that it can performed miracles that can heal sickness of those who touches the said icon.

== Economy ==
[[File:Gaisano Capital Sogod.JPG|350px|left|thumb|[[Gaisano|Gaisano Capital Sogod]] - first constructed mall in [[Southern Leyte]].]]
The total [[Internal Revenue Allotment]] (IRA) of the municipality of Sogod for the [[Fiscal year|fiscal]] year of 2008 is PHP 58,209,905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dbm.gov.ph/irapdf08/pcm/VIII.pdf|title= CY 2008 FINAL INTERNAL REVENUE ALLOTMENT FOR LGUs (Southern Leyte)|year= 2008|publisher= www.dbm.gov.ph|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the municipality as the largest income-maker and IRA in the entire province of Southern Leyte. Also, it is one of the largest in the entire of island and being competitive to other neighboring municipalities like Abuyog, Albuera, Bato, Baybay, Dulag, Hilongos, Liloan, San Juan, and Maasin City. The municipality is one of the fastest growing economies in the southern portion of island of Leyte, as it is very evident until today because many people from other communities gather in the public market and in the major groceries (like Joaquin Yap and Sons Marketing, Inc. (JYSMI), PANELANS and the Antonio  Palanca Remedios Aquino (APRA) Grocery) to meet their local necessities and to sell their products and produce. Fishes, meat, vegetables and rice are also abundant in the public market of Sogod because there are many consumers and they can afford to transfer their produce from their area to the market easily by well-maintained roads and infrastructure that leads to the ''poblacion''.

Majority of the people living in the Pacific Coast and the [[Panaon Island]] chooses Sogod as their choice because of its proximity and location than commuting to Maasin City due to its location, being the farthest area of trade. The municipality is also booming due to the heavy migration that the municipality has encountered, seeking a better future in the municipality.

Despite of its economy, the town is facing a major facelift, as the town undergoes several construction of buildings like banks, cooperatives, restaurants and a mall. [[Gaisano|Gaisano Capital]] Group, one of largest shopping mall chains in the country, has been opened it's first constructed mall in the [[Southern Leyte|province]] last June 10, 2011 during the town fiesta and can be found at the corner between Benito Faelnar Circumferential Road and Bagares Street, Barangay Zone V.

=== Banking and Finance ===
[[Bank]]s and [[pawnshops]] are becoming the indicator of economic growth in the municipality. The town, since the mid 1990s, is experiencing the high economic rate and mass migration due to banking, making it as the center of trade and commerce in Southern Leyte. Nowadays, Sogod has established six banks and eight pawnshops and attracting people from other places.

=== Industry ===

'''Manufacturing and Trade'''
[[File:Port of Sogod - July 10, 2011.JPG|350px|right|thumb|Port of Sogod - trade route that links to [[Mindanao]] and other provinces.]]
[[Manufacturing]] is small scale: [[charcoal]] (burnt coconut shells), [[abaca]] products, [[ceramics]], [[coconut oil]], [[furniture]] making, hollow block making, and [[gravel]] and [[sand]].  Export products are copra, abaca, abaca handicrafts and fiber craft items.  Minerals  As of 1992, the province of Southern Leyteâs metallic reserves totaled 771,830 metric tons. All of the municipalities and one city in the province have mineral deposits including Sogod. The town has [[magnesite]], [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[copper]] deposits. However, Sogodâs mountains are unexplored and the soil is not suitable for mining due to soft clay surface.

'''Metalworks'''&lt;br /&gt;
Except for [[blacksmithing]], work is undertaken principally in the ''poblacion'' and in the barrios of Sogod, turning out working bolos, machete and steel fabrication of window grills and other household needs; metalwork for the past years changed but the old process in molding metals are still being used. The body repairs of vehicles are carried out by small metal shops somewhere in the municipality or in Barangay Talisay in Bontoc, doubling as jack-of-all-trade. [[Metalwork]] is concerned with an accessory fabrication for pump boats that abound in the townâs waters and building construction where steel had replaced the disappearing wood as housing material.

== Health ==
[[File:Sogod District Hospital.JPG|350px|right|thumb|Sogod District Hospital]]
The Municipality of Sogod has one government-owned hospital and three private hospitals that cater the community. Recently, the three hospitals (excluding the newly constructed Pudpud Surgical Hospital) has upgraded its equipments and rehabilitated its facilities and buildings. Doctors in the municipality are taking shifts and regular visits in these hospitals to require the needs of the people. Nurses and midwives are also doing their job to assure the patientâs health. However, the municipality is a recipient of the N.A.R.S project, a program that gives jobs to those nursing students who are unemployed, supplies nurses to Sogod District Hospital. Nursing students from the schools in Sogod are practicing their profession in the hospitals that were assigned.

=== List of Hospitals ===

* '''Consuelo K. Tan Memorial Medical Center''' (established in 1960) â OsmeÃ±a Street, Barangay Zone II, Sogod, Southern Leyte
* '''Corrompido Specialty Hospital''' (established in 1960) â Leopoldo Regis Street, Barangay Zone V, Sogod, Southern Leyte
* '''Pudpud Surgical Hospital''' â Barangay San Miguel, Sogod, Southern Leyte
* '''Sogod District Hospital''' (created on June 18, 1960, through the provisions stated by the Republic Act No. 2693) â OsmeÃ±a Street, Barangay Zone I, Sogod, Southern Leyte

== Communications ==
Telephone systems are served by [[Bayan Telecommunications]] ([[BayanTel]]), covering the town of Sogod and the nearby town of Bontoc; and Globe Telecoms, covers the town of Sogod and nearby communities.  Cellphone systems are also being improved in the town since its existence on 2001 with [[Smart Communications]] as the first company to set foot on the town grounds by making cell towers, providing signal to the community and its environs. Later, [[Globe Telecom]] build their cell towers in the town and creating cellphone signals to the community.

== Cable Television ==
The town has its own cable television that operates the towns of Sogod and Bontoc. The Sogod Cable TV, owned by Congressman Roger G. Mercado, provides 40 to 50 channels with less payment for every month. Recently, the cable television upgraded its facilities and also their signals eastward, providing excellent receptions from the barrio folks.  Also, Dream Satellite TV is operating also in the town and other places in Leyte.

== Transportation ==

[[File:Sogod Bus Terminal - Sogod, Southern Leyte.JPG|left|350px|thumb|Sogod Bus Terminal]]

The medium of transportation in the [[municipality]] is the ''potpot'', a [[tricycle]] which carries nine to twelve passengers including the driver. But people in the far flung areas use the ''habal-habal'', a hired motorcycle which carries less than eight persons including the driver.  The potpots in Sogod has their assigned color scheme which indicates their area. There are three colored potpots which roam towards the entire vicinity of the municipality and other towns, which are Blue, Red and White. The Blue ones are assigned only on the poblacion (town proper) and in the barrios that is equidistant to the poblacion (Barangays Mabicay, Pandan, San Isidro and San Miguel in Sogod, and Barangays Casao and Santa Cruz in [[Bontoc, Southern Leyte|Bontoc]]). The white potpots are assigned westwards from Barangay Casao, to the town of Tomas Oppus. The red potpots are traversing eastwards from Barangay San Isidro to Barangays Buac Gamay, Consolacion and Maac.   The fare ranges from PHP 6.00 to P10.00 in the entire poblacion and its environs in blue ''potpots''; PHP 10.00 is minimum rate with PHP 1.00 for every succeeding barangay from Sogod to Barangay Maac in the red motorcabs; PHP 10.00 is the minimum rate from Sogod to [[Tomas Oppus]] in [[white]] motorcabs (potpot). [[File:Transportation in Poblacion Sogod.JPG|right|350px|thumb|Motorized tricycles are Sogod's primary transportation.]] In days without school, the rates are increased with P1.00 without further notice.  The ''habals-habals'' or single motorcycles are used as modes of transportation in carrying commuters and excess baggage to distant and mountainous areas in the municipality. Its area covers the barangays northwards from Barangay Suba (Crossing Sawong) to Barangay Kahupian and to Mahaplag; Barangay Suba (Crossing Sawong) to Barangay San Francisco; Barangays Magatas and Benit to Barangays Kauswagan and Hipantag; westwards from Barangays Milagroso, Santa Maria to Barangay Libas; Barangays Mabicay and Pangi to Barangays Libas, Ta-a, and Cabadbaran; Barangays Libas to Barangay Hilaan to Bontoc; Barangay Hilaan (Bontoc) to Barangay San Vicente (Bontoc); and on the east covers Barangays Buac Daku, Malinao and Maria Plana.  There are no fixed [[rates]] in commuting habals-habals because it is not registered as transportation in [[Land Transportation Office]] (LTO). But the suggested fare is P15.00 to P50.00, depending on the distance of its destination. Like the ''potpots'', the rates are increased when it comes to summer.  On traversing from Sogod to other places, there are plenty of [[vehicles]] that accommodate in Sogod because the town is the major terminus in the south central portion in Leyte Island. It is the vital link in connecting Visayas to Mindanao.   The [[buses]], [[jeepneys]], and for hire [[vans]] terminate from Sogod to [[Maasin City]], [[Ormoc City]], [[Tacloban City]], [[Bato, Leyte|Bato]]-[[Hilongos]], [[Liloan, Southern Leyte|Liloan]], [[Hinunangan]] and [[Silago]]. Fairs are organized by the [[Land Transportation Office]] (LTO).

=== Agas-Agas Bridge ===

The Agas-Agas Bridge is situated in [[Southern Leyte]], the highest ever built in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lakbaypilipinas.com/blog/2009/08/09/agas-agas-bridge-philippines-tallest-leyte-bridge-is-the-countrys-newest-tourist-attraction.html|title= Agas-Agas Bridge : Philippines Tallest Leyte bridge is the countryâs newest tourist attraction|date= August 9, 2009|publisher= lakbaypilipinas.com|accessdate=April 30, 2011}} {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge straddles between two mountains and traverses along the Mahaplag-Sogod (south-central) section of the [[Maharlika Highway]]. It provides a significant link to motorists traveling from Luzon to [[Mindanao]]. This bridge is by far the tallest pier or column that the Philippine [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] (DPWH) has constructed with a help from the Japanese Government. It involves the construction of a 350 linear meter bridge, with a mix of steel and concrete, supported by two piers from the ground and has a height of 292&amp;nbsp;feet above ground.

Residents said that the Agas-Agas section of the Maharlika Highway in Southern Leyte is known for being prone to slides during heavy rains. Since it is situated in a mountainous area, it is regularly reported that movements of loose soil or [[landslide]]s take place whenever it rains heavily, much more when typhoon strikes the province. Thus, the [[viaduct]] was constructed in 2006 primarily to help motorists avoid the mountainous sections that are prone to landslides and road slips and prevent life and property losses.

Seeing its high tourism potential the [[Department of Public Works and Highways]] (DPWH), the executive department which is responsible for all safety of projects in the filed of public works and roads, submitted to the [[President Gloria Arroyo]], a plan to turn the PHP 1,024,000 billion bridge into a haven for sports enthusiasts who are into bungee jumping, paramotor, downhill skateboarding and zipline rapelling and other extreme sports. Seeing the panoramic beauty of the mountains and rivers around it, then-President Arroyo had ordered that a bungee jumping platform be constructed along the bridge as well as other tourists amenities.

'''Zip Southern Leyte'''

On April 11, 2011,The newly completed construction of the much-awaited zip line, an environment friendly tourist attraction, has now become an added feature of Agas-agas Bridge, the tallest bridge in the Philippines located in Sogod, Southern Leyte.

A soft opening of Zip Southern Leyte, is the first tandem zipline facility in Eastern Visayas, will be officially opened to the public on Friday, Provincial Governor Damian G. Mercado said in his letter invitation to PIA Southern Leyte.

The zip line extreme sports facility is the typical Public Private Partnership (PPP) undertaking by the provincial government of Southern Leyte and a local investor, Edwin Sakdalan, who is based in Camp Sabros, Digos City, Provincial Tourism Officer Nedgar Garvez said to PIA. PPP is a priority project.

On the same occasion, the provincial government has also scheduled for the groundbreaking ceremony of the planned Provincial Pavilion at the vicinity of Agas-agas Bridge in Barangay Kahupian, Sogod, he said.

From Maasin City, a motorcade will commence at the Provincial Capitol at Agas-agas Bridge and converge at Sogod Suba Junction road for the motorcade coming from Libagon, Pacific and Pana-on municipal and provincial officials, he further said.

The Southern Leyte Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SLCCI) has identified the construction of zip line among the four tourism hubs, namely, the Canopy Walk in the virgin forests of Silago, dive sites of San Francisco and Padre Burgos and the animal park in Danao Forest Park in Maasin City, SLCCI President Engr. Robert CastaÃ±ares disclosed to PIA earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=1&amp;t=1&amp;id=27065.html|title= Zip Southern Leyte in Sogod completes construction, opens to public soon|last= Gorne|first= Es|date= April 11, 2011|publisher= pia.gov.ph|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
Two radio stations, DYSL (Government) an AM and FM station operating in SLSU Campus, Barangay San Roque, and the DYSC 101.1 (owned by the [[Radyo Natin Network]]) an FM station that is operating also in Barangay San Roque, serves the locals with programs and news.  Print media is also present in the municipality. There are two provincial newspapers which are the ''Southern Leyte Times'' (English) and the ''Southern Leyte Balita'' (Cebuano). The newspapers are based in the capital city of Maasin and gives accurate and constructive news on the province and the neighboring Leyte province. Other leading newspapers have reached the town before the establishment of provincial newspapers providing the news from the entire nation and in the world.

[[File:Sogod Bay.jpg|left|350px|thumb|Sogod Coastline in Barangay San Jose]]

Unfortunately, the Municipality of Sogod pays no attention to the sites found in the town. There are falls, a lake and a cave system, beaches and hotels. But accommodations are plenty to choose from and found at the vicinity of the poblacion.

The '''Pasanon Falls''' and River in Barangay Dagsa, '''Lum-an Falls''' in Barangay Lum-an, '''Lake Lanao''' and Springs in Barangay San Juan, '''Subangdaku River''' in Barangays Suba and San Miguel, man-made lake in Barangay Malinao, '''Labong Cave''' in Barangay Javier, '''Magapso Beach''' in Barangay Maac, Black Sand Beaches in Barangay Consolacion and Prima, Cabadoy and Palanca Pebble Beaches in Barangay San Jose are one of the few sites that the municipality can offer. But some of these sites are in ruins, endangered or rather unexplored by human activities.

In the fields of infrastructure and agro-tourism, the '''Agas-Agas Bridge''' is famous and considered as the highest bridge in the Philippines. It stands 85&amp;nbsp;meters tall or 1,000&amp;nbsp;feet high and spans 300&amp;nbsp;meters connecting the Maharlika Highway. It is built so, because the area is prone to landslides and often many accidents occurred in this narrow corridor with a deep ravine on its side. Today, the bridge carries visitors to visit the area and government officials have plans to make it as a tourist attraction. Some bridges like the Subangdaku Bridge is regarded as one of the longest bridge in the entire province and up to now another bridge is constructed to minimize the travel time for the commuters traveling along the arterial highways. Along the bridge, one can see a dam that controls the river current when bad weather occurs. Also, CTL Farms, named in-memory of the owner's son Carlo Tirso Luzon, in Barangay Concepcion and La Caridad Farms in Barangay Buac Gamay offers wide array of beautiful flora and fauna. The farms also offer many activities, either you can go fishing or roam around and enjoy the fields of green by affordable prices.

=== Cainting Cave and Falls ===

A hidden cave has recently been discovered by foreign visitors who enjoyed its long bushy trail complete with leeches down wet crossings.
Former Mayor Edmund Villa shared a rather unlikely advice from the very people who had trekked the site: don't touch anything there.

The foreigners stressed that the natural ways of going to the covered hideaway be left as it is, including the leeches, to underscore nature at its best, former mayor Villa said, quoting his visitors.

He described the site as the meeting point of three rivers, a scenic junction which developed into a natural pool deep into the jungle in what remains as Sogod's lush forests- an imposing sight to behold.

The blissful area can be reached after a three kilometer walk from the road proper - virtually just a short distance, but surely a bloody one if any unsuspecting intruder is not careful enough for blood-sucking ''&quot;limatok&quot;'', the presence of which added yet another twisting thrill and adventure to the trip. The cave, matched with a cascading falls, has not yet been fully explored inside.

The advice on not to touch anything at a natural resort was a basic principle in eco-tourism, where the natural environment would be preserved for all its inherent beauty, wonders and surprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&amp;sec=reader&amp;rp=1&amp;fi=p031211.htm&amp;no=5&amp;date=12/11/2003.html|title= Kainting Cave in Sogod attracts tourists|date= 2003-12-11|publisher= www.pia.gov.ph|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cave is in Barangay San Francisco Mabuhay, a barangay found in the mountainous area of the municipality, is accessible by a rough road leading to Sitio Kabernal (part of Barangay Kahupian, Sitio Silao Bato (part of Barangay Kahupian) and Sitio Hagna (part of Barangay San Francisco Mabuhay) through ''habal-habal'' (single tricycles). The cave, however, is equidistant to the Agas-Agas Bridge, the municipal cattle farms, and the zipline.

Besides, it helps when any tourists attraction is not meticulously planned, after all, to make for a spontaneous hike or climb from interested nature lovers and less development expense, too, on the part of the local government.
