[[Knight Bachelor|Sir]] '''Ludovic Henry Coverley Kennedy''' (3 November 1919{{ndash}}18 October 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_obit&quot;/&gt;) was a British [[journalist]], [[Presenter|broadcaster]], [[humanism|humanist]] and author best known for re-examining cases such as the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]] and the murder convictions of [[Timothy Evans]] and [[Derek Bentley]], and for his role in the abolition of the [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|death penalty]] in the United Kingdom.

==Early life and naval career==
Kennedy was born in [[Edinburgh]], the son of a career [[Royal Navy]] officer, Edward Coverley Kennedy, and his wife, Rosalind Grant, daughter of [[Grant Baronets|Sir Ludovic Grant, 11th Baronet]]. His mother Rosalind was a cousin of the Conservative politician [[Robert Boothby, Baron Boothby|Robert Boothby]], later Lord Boothby. He was schooled at [[Eton College]] (where he played in a jazz band with [[Humphrey Lyttelton]]),&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; and was set for university when the [[Second World War]] broke out.

Kennedy's father, by then a 60 year old retired captain, returned to the navy and was given command of [[HMS Rawalpindi|HMS ''Rawalpindi'']],&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; a hastily militarised [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] steamship, known as an [[Armed merchantmen|Armed Merchant Cruiser]]. On 23 November 1939, while on patrol southeast of [[Iceland]] the ''Rawalpindi'' encountered two of the most powerful German warships, the small battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} trying to break out through the [[GIUK gap]] into the Atlantic. The ''Rawalpindi'' was able to signal the German ships' location back to base. Despite being hopelessly outgunned, Captain Edward Coverley Kennedy of the ''Rawalpindi'' decided to fight, rather than surrender as demanded by the Germans. ''Scharnhorst'' sank ''Rawalpindi''; of her 312 crew 275 (including her captain) were killed. His son Ludovic was just twenty years old. Captain Kennedy was posthumously [[Mentioned in Despatches]] and his decision to fight against overwhelming odds entered the folklore of the Royal Navy.&lt;ref name=&quot;navy_rawalpindi&quot;/&gt;

Ludovic Kennedy followed his father into the navy; he served as an officer on [[destroyer]]s, mostly in the same northern seas. His ship ([[HMS Tartar (F43)|HMS ''Tartar'']]) was one of those that pursued the [[battleship]] [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] following the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]] although he did not witness her sinking because ''Tartar'' went to refuel some hours before the end.  Kennedy later wrote about this in ''Pursuit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Kennedy | first= Ludovic | title= Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the &quot;Bismarck&quot; | ISBN = 978-0-304-35526-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; his chronicle of the chase and sinking of the ''Bismarck''.&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt;

He had two younger sisters, Morar and Katherine. Morar married the playwright [[Royce Ryton]] in 1954. Katherine married Major [[Ion Calvocoressi]] in 1947.

==Journalism and broadcasting==
After the war he attended [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and began a career as a journalist.&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt;

A campaigning, investigative reporter, Kennedy wrote for a number of publications, including ''[[Newsweek]]''. From 1953, he edited and introduced the ''First Reading'' radio series on the [[BBC Third Programme]], presenting young writers such as [[Kingsley Amis]] and [[Philip Larkin]]. Later he became a television journalist and a [[news presenter|newsreader]] on ITV's [[Independent Television News]]. He presented the BBC's flagship current affairs programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' for several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;herald_obit&quot;/&gt; Kennedy was interested in miscarriages of justice, and he wrote and broadcast on numerous cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

From 1980 to 1988&lt;ref name=&quot;Steel&quot;/&gt; he presented the television review programme ''[[Did You See...?]]'' He interviewed [[Peter Cook]]'s character [[Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling]] in ''A Life in Pieces'' in 1990. He appeared as himself in several episodes on the political comedy series ''[[Yes, Minister]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/yes-minister/the-challenge/episode/74550/summary.html |title=Yes, Minister: 'The Challenge' episode summary |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/yes-prime-minister/the-tangled-web/episode/156010/summary.html?tag=prev_episode;title |title=Yes, Prime Minister: 'The Tangled Web' episode summary |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=2010-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was the subject of an episode of ''[[That Reminds Me]]'' (2002: season 4, episode 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epguides.com/ThatRemindsMe/ |title=That Reminds Me: A Titles &amp; Air Dates Guide |date=2006 |publisher=epguides.com |accessdate=2010-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine sometimes referred to him as 'Ludicrous Kennedy'.  In the long-running BBC sitcom ''[[Till Death Us Do Part (British TV series)|Till Death Us Do Part]]'', [[Alf Garnett]] - while attacking BBC personalities - spoke of him as a ''Russian Mick'' (''&quot;Mick&quot;'' being an offensive term for an Irishman), meaning &quot;that ''Ludovich Kennedy!&quot;''

==Writing==
[[File:Timothyevans.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Timothy Evans under arrest]]

Kennedy's highly regarded book ''Pursuit: The Chase and Sinking of the &quot;Bismarck&quot;'' (ISBN 978-0-304-35526-6) detailed the career of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], her sinking of British [[battlecruiser]] [[HMS Hood (51)|''Hood'']], and her destruction by the Royal Navy.

===Miscarriages of justice===
He wrote several books that questioned convictions in a number of notable cases in British criminal history. One of the first [[miscarriages of justice]] he investigated was the conviction and hanging of [[Timothy Evans]] in his book ''[[John Christie (murderer)|Ten Rillington Place]]'' (ISBN 978-0-586-03428-6). He was found to have murdered his baby daughter in 1950, but Kennedy contended that Evans was innocent, and that the murders of his wife and baby had been committed by the [[serial killer]] [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;  Christie was hanged three years after the hanging of Evans, following the discovery of six more bodies at 10 Rillington Place, none of which could be ascribed to Evans. Indeed, two of the skeletons found at the house dated back to the war. After a long campaign, Evans was [[Wiktionary:posthumous|posthumously]] [[pardon]]ed in 1966. The scandal helped in the abolition of the [[death penalty]] in the UK. Kennedy's book was filmed in 1970: [[Richard Fleischer]]'s film ''[[10 Rillington Place]]'' starred [[John Hurt]] as Evans and [[Richard Attenborough]] as Christie.

In 1985, Kennedy published ''The Airman And The Carpenter'' (ISBN 978-0-670-80606-5), in which he argued that [[Bruno Hauptmann]] did not kidnap and murder [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s baby, a crime for which he was executed in 1936.&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; The book was made into a 1996 [[HBO]] film ''[[Crime of the Century (TV film)|Crime Of The Century]]'', starring [[Stephen Rea]] and [[Isabella Rossellini]].&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt;

In 1990, Kennedy became the advisory committee chairman of [[David Jessel|''Just Television'']], a television production company dedicated to exposing miscarriages of justice.

In 2003, he wrote ''36 Murders and 2 Immoral Earnings'' (ISBN 978-1-86197-457-0), in which he analysed a number of noted cases, including the Evans case and those of [[Derek Bentley]] and the [[Birmingham Six]], a number of which were affected by claims of police failure, [[police misconduct]] or [[perjury]]. In it he concluded that the [[adversarial system]] of justice in the UK and the United States &quot;is an invitation to the police to commit perjury, which they frequently do&quot;, and said that he preferred the [[inquisitorial system]].

==Politics==

In 1958, Kennedy stood for election to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate in the [[Rochdale by-election, 1958|Rochdale by-election]] called after the death of the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, [[Wentworth Schofield]] in December 1957.  He lost to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, [[Jack McCann]], but achieved a massive increase in the Liberal vote, pushing the Conservatives into a distant third place. The Rochdale contest was the first British by-election to receive live television coverage (locally, by [[Granada Television]]).

Kennedy supported [[Scottish Independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_obit&quot;/&gt;

==Campaigning==
In addition to his writing and campaigning on [[Miscarriage of justice|miscarriages of justice]], Kennedy campaigned on a number of other issues.

A lifelong [[atheism|atheist]], he published ''All In The Mind: A Farewell To God'' (ISBN 978-0-340-68063-6) in 1999, in which he discussed his philosophical objections to religion, and the ills he felt had come from [[Christianity]]. He was a Distinguished Supporter of the [[British Humanist Association]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_report_of_death&quot;/&gt; he contributed to ''[[New Humanist]]'' magazine, he was an Honorary Associate of the [[National Secular Society]] and a Distinguished Supporter of the [[Humanist Society of Scotland]].

He was also an advocate of the legalisation of [[assisted suicide]], and is a co-founder and former chair of the [[Voluntary Euthanasia Society]]. His book, ''Euthanasia: The Case for the Good Death'' (ISBN 978-0-7011-3639-0), was published in 1990.

Kennedy resigned from the [[Liberal Democrats]] in 2001,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_kennedy_quits_libdems&quot;/&gt; citing the incompatibility of his pro-voluntary euthanasia views with those of the then Liberal Democrat leader [[Charles Kennedy]] (no relation) who is a Roman Catholic.

He then stood as an independent on a platform of legalising voluntary euthanasia in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] for the [[Wiltshire]] constituency of [[Devizes (UK Parliament constituency)|Devizes]].&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; He won 2% of the vote and subsequently rejoined the Liberal Democrats.

== Personal life ==
In February 1950 he married the dancer and actress [[Moira Shearer]] in the [[Chapel Royal]], [[Hampton Court Palace]]. The couple went on to have one son and three daughters from a 56-year marriage that ended with her death on 31 January 2006 at the age of 80.

==Honours==
He received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Strathclyde]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;strathclyde_hon_degree&quot;/&gt;

He was [[knighthood|knighted]] in 1994 for services to journalism, on the recommendation of [[John Major]]'s government.  Major's predecessor [[Margaret Thatcher]] had vetoed Kennedy's knighthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_obit&quot;/&gt;

== Death ==
Kennedy died of [[pneumonia]] in a nursing home in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 18 October 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booth&quot;/&gt;
