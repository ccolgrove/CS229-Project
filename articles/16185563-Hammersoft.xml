'''''Zombie Nation''''' is a [[2004 in film|2004]] independent horror film directed by [[Ulli Lommel]].

== Plot outline ==
Police officer Joe Singer lives a secret night life in which he kidnaps women, and takes them bound to his warehouse loft, injects them with a mysterious liquid, and then murders them. During his day shift as a cop, Joe is angry and vitriolic on the job. He arrests a woman for jay walking and she ends up in the loft. A psychiatrist visits Joe and keeps repeating, &quot;Is it safe?&quot; A group of Voodoo priestesses perform a ritual that brings several of Joe's victims back to life as zombies. These girls attack and eat random people before they eventually find Joe.

== Reception ==
Reception of the film has been overwhelmingly negative. As of February 15, 2011, ''Zombie Nation'' is ranked #11 worst movie on [[IMDb]]'s Bottom 100&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom&lt;/ref&gt;.

The following is an excerpt from IMDb's reviews page, an addition made by acclaimed film reviewer Timothy Morrissey:

&quot;I was not sure, at any stage, whether this film was made as a satirical portrayal of low-brow horror films, and the ridiculousness of this genre's position as a segue between proper dramatic film and naff obscenity, or whether it was the result of a group of cashed up wanna be directors/actors/cinematographers who, bursting with the ill gotten prestige of their celebrity parents, have put together a collection of their favourite storylines, scenes, and dramatic effects to create a monsterously absurd turd of a film, starring their friends and a group of pornographic actors.  I hope, for the love of God, that it is the former.&quot;
