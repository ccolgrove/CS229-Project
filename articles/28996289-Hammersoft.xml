'''Gliese 581 g''' ({{pron-en|ËÉ¡liËzÉ}}), also '''Gl 581 g''' or '''GJ 581 g''', is an [[extrasolar planet]] of the [[red dwarf]] star [[Gliese 581]], 20.5 light-years from Earth in the [[constellation]] of [[Libra (constellation)|Libra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/science/Found-Planet-thats-just-like-Earth/articleshow/10899740.cms ''Times of India'' website]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the sixth planet discovered in the [[Gliese 581#Planetary system|Gliese 581 planetary system]] and the fourth in order of increasing distance from the star. The discovery was announced by the [[Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey]] in late September 2010, after a decade of observation.  However, according to one recent study the planet may be &quot;unlikely&quot; to exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forveille&quot;&gt;{{Cite arxiv |last=Forveille |first=T. |coauthors=Bonfils, X.; Delfosse, X.; Alonso, R.; Udry, S.; Bouchy, F.; Gillon, M.; Lovis, C.; Neves, V.; Mayor, M.; Pepe, F.; Queloz, D.; Santos, N.

Gliese 581 g has attracted attention because, if it exists, it is near the middle of the [[habitable zone]] of its parent star.  That means it could sustain liquid water on its surface and could potentially host life similar to that on Earth. (The planet is expected to be around 20 Farenheit degrees cooler than Earth, however). If it is a [[terrestrial planet|rocky planet]], favorable atmospheric conditions could permit the presence of liquid water, a [[Water#Effects on life|necessity for all known life]], on its surface. With a mass 3.1 to 4.3 times Earth's, Gliese 581 g is considered a [[super-Earth]] and is the planet closest in size to Earth known in a habitable zone. This makes it the most [[Terrestrial planet#Most Earth-like exoplanets|Earth-like]] [[Goldilocks planet]] found outside the [[Solar System]] and the exoplanet with the greatest recognized potential for harboring life.&lt;ref name= &quot;Palmer&quot;&gt;The planet is much too far away to reach with today's technology: at the speed of the [[space shuttle]], &quot;it would take 766,000 years to get to Gliese 581 gâthat's more than three times longer than homo sapiens have been around.&quot; - {{Cite news|last = Palmer|first = Brian|url = http://www.slate.com/id/2269244 |title = Gliese 581 g or Bust!|work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], [[Washingtonpost Newsweek Interactive]] |date = 2010-09-30|accessdate = 2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The detection of Gliese 581 g after such a [[Discoveries of extrasolar planets|short period of searching]] and at such close proximity has led some astronomers to hypothesize that the proportion of stars with habitable planets may be greater than ten percent.&lt;ref name = &quot;Vogt&quot;/&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:GJ581orbits Vogt2010.svg|thumb|left|The six-planet model of the [[Gliese 581]] planetary system with circular orbits.]]
The planet was detected by astronomers in the [[Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey]], led by principal investigator [[Steven S. Vogt]], professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] and co-investigator [[R. Paul Butler]] of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. The discovery was made using [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial velocity measurements]], combining 122 observations obtained over 11 years from the [[W. M. Keck Observatory#Instruments|High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer]] (HIRES) instrument of the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck 1 telescope]] with 119 measurements obtained over 4.3 years from the [[High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher]] (HARPS) instrument of the [[European Southern Observatory]]'s [[ESO 3.6 m Telescope|3.6 m telescope]] at [[La Silla Observatory]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Vogt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last = Alleyne|first = Richard|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/8033124/Gliese-581g-the-most-Earth-like-planet-yet-discovered.html|title = Gliese 581g the most Earth like planet yet discovered|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date = 2010-09-30|accessdate = 2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After subtracting the signals of the previously known Gliese 581 planets, ''[[Gliese 581 b|b]]'', ''[[Gliese 581 c|c]]'', ''[[Gliese 581 d|d]]'' and ''[[Gliese 581 e|e]]'', the signals of two additional planets were apparent: a 445-day signal from a newly recognized outermost planet designated ''[[Gliese 581 f|f]]'', and the 37-day signal from Gliese 581 g.&lt;ref name = &quot;Vogt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Alexander&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Alexander|first=Amir|title=Billions and Billions?

Although not sanctioned by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]'s naming conventions, Vogt's team informally refers to the planet as &quot;'''Zarmina's World'''&quot; after his wife,&lt;ref name= &quot;Meichsner&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last = Meichsner|first = Von Irene|url = http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1284751479322.shtml|title = ErdÃ¤hnlicher Planet entdeckt|work=[[KÃ¶lner Stadt-Anzeiger]]|date = 2010-09-30|accessdate = 2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some cases simply as '''Zarmina'''.

===Nondetection in new HARPS data analysis===

Two weeks after the announcement of the discovery of Gliese 581 g,  astronomer [[Francesco Pepe]] of the [[Geneva Observatory]] reported that in a new analysis of 179 measurements taken by the [[HARPS]] spectrograph over 6.5 years, neither planet ''g'' nor planet ''f'' was detectable.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kerr&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kerr|first=Richard A.|title=Recently Discovered Habitable World May Not Exist|work=Science Now|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]]|date=2010-10-12|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/10/recently-discovered-habitable-world.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mullen&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Mullen|first=Leslie|title=Doubt Cast on Existence of Habitable Alien World|publisher=''Astrobiology Magazine''|date=2010-10-12|url = http://www.astrobio.net/exclusive/3647/doubt-cast-on-existence-of-habitable-alien-world|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogt responded to the latest concerns by saying, &quot;I am not overly surprised by this as these are very weak signals, and adding 60 points onto 119 does not necessarily translate to big gains in sensitivity.&quot;  He cautioned that not finding the planet in this study does not make a strong case for it not existing, because both data sets may be needed to detect it.&lt;ref name= &quot;Grossman&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Grossman|first=Lisa|title = Exoplanet Wars: &quot;First Habitable World&quot; May Not Exist |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=2010-10-12 |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/10/gliese581g-may-not-exist |accessdate =2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Vogt added, &quot;I feel confident that we have accurately and honestly reported our uncertainties and done a thorough and responsible job extracting what information this data set has to offer. I feel confident that anyone independently analyzing this data set will come to the same conclusions.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;Wall&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wall|first=Mike|title = Astronomer Stands By Discovery of Alien Planet Gliese 581g Amid Doubts|publisher=[[Space.com]]|date=2010-10-13|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/gliese-581g-discoverer-responds-101013.html|accessdate =2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in the two groups' results may involve the planetary orbital characteristics assumed in calculations.  According to MIT astronomer [[Sara Seager]], Vogt postulated the planets around Gliese 581 had perfectly circular orbits whereas the Swiss group thought the orbits were more [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Cowen&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cowen|first=Ron|title = Swiss team fails to confirm recent discovery of an extrasolar planet that might have right conditions for life|work=[[Science News]]|date = 2010-10-13|url = http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/64308/title/Existence_of_habitable_exoplanet_questioned |accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference in approach may be the reason for the disagreement, according to [[Alan Boss]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowen&quot;/&gt; Butler remarked that with additional observations, &quot;I would expect that on the time scale of a year or two this should be settled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerr&quot;/&gt; Other astronomers also supported a deliberate evaluation: Seager stated, &quot;We will have consensus at some point; I don't think we need to vote right now.&quot; and [[Ray Jayawardhana]] noted, &quot;Given the extremely interesting implications of such a discovery, it's important to have independent confirmation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowen&quot;/&gt; Gliese 581 g is listed as &quot;unconfirmed&quot; in the ''[[Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exoplanet.eu/star.php?st=Gl+581|title=Notes for star Gl 581|work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia|accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erroneous data analysis===
In December 2010, a methodological error has been revealed in the data analysis that led to the &quot;discovery&quot; of Gliese 581 f and g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1012.3754|title=Dos and don'ts of reduced chi-squared|author1=Rene Andrae|author2=Tim Schulze-Hartung|author3=Peter Melchior|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team around Steven Vogt inferred the number of exoplanets by using a [[chi square|reduced chi-square]], although the orbital models are nonlinear in the model parameters. Therefore, reduced chi-square is not a trustworthy diagnostic. In fact, an investigation of the fit residuals showed that the data used by Vogt's team actually prefers a model with four planets, not six, in agreement with the results of Francesco Pepe's team.

===Further analyses of HIRES/HARPS data===

Another re-analysis found no clear evidence for a fifth planetary signal in the combined HIRES/HARPS data set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1101.0800 |author1=Gregory |title=Bayesian Re-analysis of the Gliese 581 Exoplanet System |class=astro-ph.SR |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The claim was made that the HARPS data ''only'' provided some evidence for 5 planet signals, while incorporation of both data sets actually ''degraded'' the evidence for more than four planets (i.e., none for 581 f or 581 g).

&quot;I have studied [the paper] in detail and do not agree with his conclusions,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/01/14/habitable-planet-gliese-vogt-gregory.html &quot;Habitable planet find doubted by B.C. scientist.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Vogt said in reply, concerned that Gregory has considered the HIRES data as more uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space.com/10897-alien-planet-gliese-581g-great-debate.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of Gliese 581g's existence won't be settled definitively until researchers gather more high-precision radial velocity data, Vogt said.

By performing a number of statistical tests, Guillen Anglada-Escude of the Carnegie Institute of Washington concluded that the existence of Gl 581 g was well supported by the available data.  This despite the presence of a statistical degeneracy that derives from an alias of the first eccentric harmonic of another planet in the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1011.0186 |author1=Guillem Anglada-EscudÃ© |title=Aliases of the first eccentric harmonic : Is GJ 581g a genuine planet
  candidate? |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a forthcoming paper, Anglada-Escude and Rebekah Dawson claim âWith the data we have, the most likely explanation is that this planet is still there.â&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/gliese-581g-questioned/&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikko Tuomi of the University of Turku performed a Bayesian re-analysis of the HARPS and HIRES data with the result that they &quot;do not imply the conclusion that there are two additional companions orbiting GJ 581&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=1102.3314 |author1=Mikko Tuomi |title=Bayesian re-analysis of the radial velocities of Gliese 581. Evidence in favour of only four planetary companions |class=astro-ph.EP |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==

Gliese 581 g has an orbital period of 37 days, orbiting at a distance of 0.146 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] from its parent star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogt&quot;/&gt; It is believed to have a mass of 3.1 to 4.3 times Earth's and a radius of 1.3 to 2.0 times Earth's (1.3 to 1.5 times larger if predominantly rocky, 1.7 to 2.0 times larger if predominantly water ice). Its mass indicates it is probably a rocky planet with a solid surface. The planet's [[surface gravity]] is expected to be in the range of [[Gravity of Earth|1.1 to 1.7 times Earth's]], enough to hold on to an atmosphere likely to be denser than [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogt&quot;/&gt;

==Tidal locking and habitability==
{{main|Habitability of red dwarf systems}}

Because of Gliese 581 g's proximity to its parent star, it is predicted to be [[Tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Gliese 581. Just as Earth's [[Moon]] always presents the same face to the Earth, the length of Gliese 581 g's [[sidereal day]] would then precisely match the length of its year, meaning it would be permanently light on one half and permanently dark on the other half of its surface.&lt;ref name = &quot;Vogt&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Berardelli |first=Phil |date=2010-09-29 |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/09/astronomers-find-most-earth-like.html |title=Astronomers Find Most Earth-like Planet to Date |work=[[Science (journal)|ScienceNOW]] |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tidal locking also means the planet would have no [[axial tilt]] and therefore no [[seasonality]] in a conventional sense.

With one side of the planet always facing the star, temperatures could range from blazing hot in the bright side to freezing cold in the dark side if atmospheric heat transport is limited. The atmosphere's inventory of volatile [[Chemical compound|compound]]s such as water and [[carbon dioxide]] could then permanently freeze out on the dark side. However, an atmosphere of the expected density would be likely to moderate these extremes.

===Atmospheric effects===
[[File:Gliese 581 system compared to solar system.jpg|thumb|right|Planetary orbits in the Gliese 581 system compared to those of our own Solar System (&quot;g&quot; designates Gliese 581g)]]
An atmosphere that is dense will circulate heat, potentially allowing a wide area on the surface to be habitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa004&amp;articleID=000CC344-B043-1353-AF3383414B7FFE9F | title=Red Star Rising | last=Alpert | first=Mark | date=2005-11-07 | work=[[Scientific American]] | accessdate = 2007â04â25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Venus]] has a [[Solar time|solar]] rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's, producing prolonged days and nights.

Whether or not a tide-locked planet with the orbital characteristics of Gliese 581g is actually habitable depends on the composition of the atmosphere and the nature of the planetary surface.  A comprehensive modeling study &lt;ref name = &quot;PierrehumbertApJL1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

The same study identified two habitable states for a water-rich planet.  If the planet has a very thin atmosphere, a thick ice crust forms over most of the surface, but the substellar point remains hot enough to yield a region of thin ice or even episodically open water.  If the planet has an atmosphere with Earthlike pressures, containing approximately 20% (molar) carbon dioxide, then the greenhouse effect is sufficiently strong to maintain a pool of open water under the substellar point with temperatures comparable to the Earth's tropics.  This state has been dubbed &quot;Eyeball Earth&quot; by the author.

Modeling of the effect of tidal locking on Gliese 581 g's possible atmosphere, using a general circulation model employing an atmosphere with Earthlike surface pressure but a highly idealized representation of radiative processes, indicates that for a solid-surface planet the locations of maximum warmth would be distributed in a sideways [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]]-shaped pattern centered near the substellar point.&lt;ref name = &quot;Heng&quot;&gt;{{Cite arxiv

===Temperatures===

It is estimated that the average global equilibrium temperature (the temperature in the absence of atmospheric effects) of Gliese 581 g ranges from 209 to 228&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] (â64 to â45&amp;nbsp;Â°C, or â84 to â49&amp;nbsp;Â°F) for [[Bond albedo]]s (reflectivities) from 0.5 to 0.3 (with the latter being more characteristic of the inner [[Solar System]]).

By comparison, Earth's present global equilibrium temperature is 255 K (â18 Â°C), which is raised to 288 K (15 Â°C) by greenhouse effects. However, when life evolved [[Archean|early in Earth's history]], the Sun's energy output is thought to have been [[Faint young Sun paradox|only about 75%]] of its current value,&lt;ref name=&quot;science177&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Two previously discovered planets in the same system, [[Gliese 581 c]] and [[Gliese 581 d|d]] (inward and outward from planet ''g'', respectively), were also regarded as potentially habitable following their discovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;udry&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2007A&amp;A...469L..43U|title=The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets.

===Potential for life===
{{further|[[Planetary habitability]]}}
In an interview with Lisa-Joy Zgorski of the [[National Science Foundation]], Steven Vogt was asked what he thought about the chances of life existing on Gliese 581 g. Vogt was optimistic: &quot;I'm not a biologist, nor do I want to play one on TV. Personally, given the ubiquity and propensity of life to flourish wherever it can, I would say that, my own personal feeling is that the chances of life on this planet are 100%. I have almost no doubt about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Release 10-172 - Video&quot;&gt;NSF. [http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_videos.jsp?cntn_id=117765&amp;media_id=68454&amp;org=NSF Press Release 10-172 - Video]. Event occurs at 41:25-42:31. See {{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |date=2010-09-29 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/science/space/30planet.html?_r=1 |title=New Planet May Be Able to Nurture Organisms |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'|accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same article Dr. Seager is quoted as saying &quot;Everyone is so primed to say here's the next place weâre going to find life, but this isnât a good planet for follow-up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Press Release 10-172 - Video&quot;/&gt;
According to Vogt, the long lifetime of red dwarfs improves the chances of life being present. &quot;It's pretty hard to stop life once you give it the right conditions&quot;, he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;sb&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Borenstein |first=Seth |date=2010-09-30 |url=http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2010/9/60768_space.html |title=Could 'Goldilocks' planet be just right for life? |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Life on other planets doesn't mean E.T. Even a simple single-cell bacteria or the equivalent of [[Mold|shower mold]] would shake perceptions about the uniqueness of life on Earth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sb&quot;/&gt;

==Implications==
[[File:KeckTwilight-hi.png|thumb|Keck telescope at twilight]]

Scientists have monitored only a relatively small number of stars in the search for exoplanets. The discovery of a potentially habitable planet like Gliese 581 g so early in the search might mean that habitable planets are more widely distributed than had been previously believed. According to Vogt, the discovery &quot;implies an interesting lower limit on the fraction of stars that have at least one potentially habitable planet as there are only ~116 known solar-type or later stars out to the 6.3 parsec distance of Gliese 581.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vogt 2010, pp.32-33.  For more information, see {{cite journal |last=Turnbull |first=Margaret C. |authorlink=Margaret Turnbull|coauthors=[[Jill Tarter|Tarter, Jill C.]] |date=March 2003 |arxiv=astro-ph/0210675 |title= Target Selection for SETI: 1. A Catalog of Nearby Habitable Stellar Systems |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing |bibcode = 2003ApJS..145..181T |doi = 10.1086/345779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This finding foreshadows what Vogt calls a new, second [[Age of Discovery]] in [[exoplanetology]]:&lt;ref&gt;NSF. Press Release 10-172 - Video. Event occurs at 17:00-17:46.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Confirmation by other teams through additional high-precision RVs would be most
welcome. But if GJ 581g is confirmed by further RV scrutiny, the mere fact that a habitable
planet has been detected this soon, around such a nearby star, suggests that Î·{{Sub|â}} could well be on the order of a few tens of percent, and thus that either we have just been incredibly lucky in this early detection, or we are truly on the threshold of a second Age of Discovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogt&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If the fraction of stars with potentially habitable planets (Î·{{Sub|â}}, &quot;[[Drake equation#eta-earth|eta-Earth]]&quot;) is on the order of a few tens of percent as Vogt proposes, and the Sun's [[stellar neighborhood]] is a typical sample of the galaxy, then the discovery of Gliese 581 g in the habitable zone of its star points to the [[Drake equation|potential of billions of Earth-like planets]] in our [[Milky Way]] galaxy alone.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt 2010, p.2.
