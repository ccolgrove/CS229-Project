Due to quarterback [[Brady Quinn]]'s poor performance in the season thus far, head coach [[Eric Mangini]] named quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] the starter.

Cleveland would trail early in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Chad Ochocinco]]. The Browns would continue to struggle in the second quarter as defensive end [[Robert Geathers]] returned a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland would respond with Anderson completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Steve Heiden]].

The Browns would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Cleveland would take the lead in the fourth quarter with a 26-yard and a 31-yard field goal from kicker [[Billy Cundiff]].

In the end, the Bengals emerged victorious with kicker [[Shayne Graham]] kicking the game-winning 31-yard field goal.

With the loss, the Browns fell to 0â4.

After a heartbreaking loss to the Bengals, the Browns headed to Buffalo, the site of their last win in Week 11 of the 2008 season, and trying to avoid tying a franchise record 11 straight losses. In very windy conditions, the Browns' hero was punter [[Dave Zastudil]] who pinned the Bills within their 5 yard line 3 times. After trading field goals in the 2nd and 3rd quarters, the Browns recovered a fumble on a punt return by WR [[Roscoe Parrish]], and kicker [[Billy Cundiff]] secured the victory with a short field goal. The Browns won despite QB [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] completing only 2 of 17 passes (11.8%) for 23 yards, setting a record for lowest completion percentage in a win since the [[AFL-NFL merger]]. This also marked [[Eric Mangini]]'s first win as head coach of the Browns.

With the win, the Browns improved to 1â4. Zastudil was named the AFC special teams player of the week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woio.com/global/story.asp?s=11314816 Dave Zastudil Named AFC Player Of The Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

Trying to snap a two-game losing streak, the Browns flew to [[Soldier Field]] for a Week 8 interconference duel with the [[Chicago Bears]]. The Browns' defense held up well early, limiting the Bears to three field goals by kicker [[Robbie Gould]] (a 37-yard &amp; a 29-yard in the first quarter and a 32-yard in the second). However, the Browns could not manage to get on the board and Chicago RB [[Matt FortÃ©]] scored on a 1-yard run, putting the Browns down 16 at the half. The Browns struck first in the third quarter on a one yard run by QB [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]], but the PAT was blocked. FortÃ© scored again in the third with a 10-yard touchdown run and the Bears put the Browns away with a 21-yard interception return for a touchdown by CB [[Charles Tillman]] in the fourth quarter. Late in the fourth, Derek Anderson was benched for [[Brady Quinn]] after going 6 of 17 (35.2%) for 76 yards and 2 interceptions.

With the loss, the Browns went into their bye week at 1â7.

Looking to snap a four-game losing streak, the Browns flew to [[Ford Field]] for a Week 11 interconference duel with the [[Detroit Lions]]. Both teams began the game with field goals, as Cleveland kicker [[Phil Dawson]] made a 44-yard field goal while Lions kicker [[Jason Hanson]] got a 31-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Browns' offense exploded as quarterback [[Brady Quinn]] completed a 59-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver [[Mohamed Massaquoi]], a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Chansi Stuckey]], and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Josh Cribbs. Detroit would answer with quarterback [[Matthew Stafford]] completing a 26-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Aaron Brown (running back)|Aaron Brown]]. The Lions would tie the game in the second quarter as Stafford hooked up with running back [[Kevin Smith (running back)|Kevin Smith]] on a 25-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 75-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Calvin Johnson (American football)|Calvin Johnson]]. Afterwards, Cleveland would end the half with Dawson nailing a 29-yard field goal.

Detroit would take the lead in the third quarter with Stafford's 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Will Heller]], the Browns would pick up a safety after Stafford was called for intentional grounding from his own end zone. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland regained the lead with Quinn's 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Michael Gaines]] (followed by running back [[Jamal Lewis]] getting a 2-point conversion run). The Lions would take over, and with no time left, Browns safety [[Brodney Pool]] intercepted the ball. However, cornerback [[Hank Poteat]] was flagged for pass interference in the end zone. Since the game cannot end on a defensive penalty, Detroit was given one un-timed down from the Browns' 1 yard line and Stafford completed the game-winning touchdown pass to tight end [[Brandon Pettigrew]].

With the loss, Cleveland fell to 1â9.

After another [[Phil Dawson]] field goal in the second, the Chiefs scored three straight touchdowns to take a 24â13 lead.

In the second half, [[Jerome Harrison]] rushed for three touchdowns and amassed a [[filibuster]]-proof majority of his 286 rushing yards. This set a Browns' rushing record for a single game, was the record for most rushing yards in the NFL this season, and was the third most rushing yards in a game in NFL history. [[Matt Cassel]]'s final desperation pass ricocheted off the cross bar, and the Browns defeated the Chiefs 41â34, with their highest point total of the season.

With the win, the Browns improved to 3â11 and finished the season 2â6 on the road.
