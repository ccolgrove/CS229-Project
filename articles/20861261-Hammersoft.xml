The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[Indianapolis Colts]] [[List of Indianapolis Colts seasons|season]]''' was the 57th season for the team in the [[National Football League]] and the 26th in Indianapolis. It was the first season since [[2002 Indianapolis Colts season|2002]] that the Colts did not have [[Tony Dungy]] on their coaching staff, due to his retirement from coaching. The 2009 Indianapolis Colts improved upon their 12â4 record from 2008 as well as winning their sixth AFC South division championship in seven years. The Colts also clinched the #1 playoff seed in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]]. The Colts became the sole undefeated team after week 15. The following week, the Colts lost to the New York Jets. During the [[2009â10 NFL playoffs|playoffs]], the Colts defeated the [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] in the divisional round and the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in the AFC Championship game, but lost to the [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] in [[Super Bowl XLIV]], 31â17.

The Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots set up for their rivalry game at Lucas Oil Stadium.  The Colts came in at 8â0 while the Patriots came in 6â2, both shooting for home field advantage during the playoffs.  The Colts struck first with a 15-yard pass from Manning to Addai.  However New England answered with 24 unanswered points in the first and second quarter.  The Colts finally got back into the game with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne towards the end of the first half.  The third quarter was scoreless with the Colts still trailing by 10, but the Patriots started the fourth with a touchdown pass to Randy Moss with the Patriots now leading 31â14.  The Colts came back quickly scoring a touchdown, making it 31â21.  After a New England field goal, the Colts scored a touchdown on an Addai run.  The Patriots were still in the lead 34â28, however the Colts were hot with Peyton Manning ready to lead them to a win if the defense could hold the Patriot offense for one more drive.  With less the two and a half minutes remaining in the game, the New England Patriots were faced with a fourth and two on the Indianapolis 28 yard line.  Bill Belichick decided to go for it on [[4th and 2|a controversial play]], where Brady threw to Kevin Faulk, who gained control of the ball behind the first down marker, forcing the Patriots to turn the ball over on downs. Having wasted their last time out on the preceding play and the play occurring before the two minute warning, the Patriots couldn't challenge the ruling on the field. With a minute left Peyton Manning found Reggie Wayne for the touchdown to seal a 35â34 victory over the Patriots.

Coming off their divisional win over the Ravens, the Colts would stay at home for the [[AFC Championship Game]] against the #5 [[New York Jets]]. After a scoreless first quarter, Indianapolis would begin the second quarter with a 25-yard field goal from kicker [[Matt Stover]]. However, the Jets responded with quarterback [[Mark Sanchez]] completing an 80-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Braylon Edwards]]. The Colts would come right back with Stover's 19-yard field goal, but New York answered with Sanchez's nine-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Dustin Keller]], followed by kicker [[Jay Feely]] making a 48-yard field goal. Fortunately, Indianapolis would strike back as quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] found rookie wide receiver [[Austin Collie]] on a 16-yard touchdown pass.

The Colts would take the lead in the third quarter with Manning hooking up with wide receiver [[Pierre GarÃ§on]] on a four-yard touchdown pass. Indianapolis would add onto their lead in the fourth quarter as Manning hooked up with tight end [[Dallas Clark]] on a 15-yard touchdown pass, followed by Stover's 21-yard field goal.

With the win, not only did the Colts improve their overall record to 16â2, but they would advance to their second Super Bowl in four years.

After the coin toss, the Saints wanted the ball first; however, this didn't help their first drive. The Colts drove the ball down the field with an attempt to score the first touchdown but was denied and forced Matt Stover to kick a 38 yard goal. But the Colts were not finished: on their next possession, Pierre Garcon caught a 19 yard TD pass from Peyton Manning, and the Colts led 10â0 after fifteen minutes. In the second quarter, the Saints were forced to look upon Garrett Hartley for two field goals â a 46 yarder and a 44 yarder respectively â and the deficit was reduced to four points by halftime.

Kicking off the second half, the Saints caught Indy by surprise with the &quot;Ambush&quot; play (an onside kick in kickoff formation), which the Saints recovered, shifting the momentum to them. Pierre Thomas caught a 16 yard screen pass from Drew Brees and NO had their first lead of the game, 13â10 after the extra point. The Colts would not be denied from scoring again with the rushing attack of Joseph Addai, capping off the scoring drive with a 4-yard run. From here, however, the Saints would be denied. The Saints still stood by Hartley to keep the game close with a 47 yard field goal, taking the score to 17â16. In the fourth quarter, Jeremy Shockey caught a two-yard touchdown pass from Drew Brees with Lance Moore catching a two-point conversion and the Saints led 24â17. In the end, it was the defense that came through when Tracy Porter intercepted and returned 74 yards for a touchdown to seal the win and the first Super Bowl title for the New Orleans Saints in their 44 year existence.

==Criticism==
In week 16, the Indianapolis Colts faced against the [[2009 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] with an undefeated record of 14â0, having already clinched homeâfield advantage throughout the playoffs. In the third quarter with a 15â10 lead, [[head coach]] [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] benched [[Peyton Manning]] for [[Curtis Painter]]. The Jets forced Painter to fumble, then recovered it for a touchdown and turned into a 18â15 lead. Indianapolis never recovered, never put Manning into the game, and lost 29â15, ending the Colts' chance at an undefeated season. Manning's reaction was, &quot;Until any player in here is the head coach, you follow orders and you follow them with all of your heart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfl.fanhouse.com/2009/12/27/colts-quit-on-perfection-pull-manning-for-painter/ |title=Colts Quit on Perfection, Pull Manning for Painter |publisher=NFL FanHouse |date= |accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On fans' reaction to the game, [[Jeff Saturday]] stated,  &quot;I don't blame them a bit, man.. I probably would have booed, too. I don't blame them.
