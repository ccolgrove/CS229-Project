'''Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol''' ('''XMPP''') is an [[open standard|open-standard]] [[communications protocol]] for [[message-oriented middleware]] based on [[XML]] (Extensible Markup Language).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | contribution-url = http://www.gnomis.org/presentasjoner/oslo2005/xmpp.pdf | contribution = XMPP as MOM | title = Greater NOrdic MIddleware Symposium (GNOMIS) | first = Leif | last = Johansson | publisher = University of Stockholm | date = April 18, 2005 | place = Oslo | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol was originally named '''Jabber''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac49/ac0/ac1/ac258/JabberInc.html Jabber Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed by the Jabber open-source community in 1999 for near-[[Real-time computing|real-time]], [[Extensibility|extensible]] [[instant messaging]] (IM), [[presence information]], and [[contact list]] maintenance. Designed to be extensible, the protocol today also finds application in [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] and file transfer signaling.

Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP uses an [[open system (computing)|open systems]] approach of development and application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations' implementations.  The software implementation and many client applications are distributed as [[free and open source software]].

The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) formed an XMPP Working Group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP WG produced four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved by the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]] as Proposed Standards in 2004. The [[XMPP Standards Foundation]] (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions.
In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 have been superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, and RFC 6122 comes to specify the XMPP address format.

XMPP-based software is deployed widely across the Internet, and by 2003, was used by over ten million people worldwide, according to the [[XMPP Standards Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://xmpp.org/xsf/press/2003-09-22.shtml | title = Jabber Instant Messaging User Base Surpasses ICQ | publisher = [[XMPP Standards Foundation]] | date = September 22, 2003 | accessdate =November 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Jeremie Miller]] began working on the Jabber technology in 1998 and released the first version of the &lt;tt&gt;[[jabberd14|jabberd]]&lt;/tt&gt; server on January 4, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/01/04/1621211 Open Real Time Messaging System]&lt;/ref&gt; The early Jabber community focused on open-source software, mainly the jabberd server (e.g., version 1.0 in May 2000, version 1.2 in October 2000, and version 1.4 in February 2001), but its major outcome proved the development of the XMPP protocol.

The early Jabber [[Communications protocol|protocol]], as developed in 1999 and 2000, formed the basis for XMPP as published in RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 (the primary changes during formalization by the IETF's XMPP Working Group were the addition of [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] for channel encryption and [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] for authentication). XMPP has often been regarded as a competitor to [[SIMPLE]], based on the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) protocol, as the standard protocol for instant messaging and presence notification.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;XMPP rises to face SIMPLE standard&quot;, Infoworld magazine, April 17, 2003 [http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/xmpp-rises-face-simple-standard-018 XMPP rises to face SIMPLE standard]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;XMPP vs SIMPLE: The race for messaging standards&quot;, Infoworld magazine, May 23, 2003 [http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/xmpp-vs-simple-race-messaging-standards-295 Infoworld.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first IM service based on XMPP was Jabber.org, which has operated continuously since 1999 and has offered free accounts to users of XMPP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6489 Chatting Up the Chef] ''Linux Journal'' March 1, 2003 by Marcel GagnÃ©&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 until February 2006, the service used [[jabberd14|jabberd]] as its server software, at which time it migrated to [[ejabberd]] (both of which are [[free software]] application servers). In January 2010, the service plans to migrate to [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] M-Link software produced by [[Isode Limited|Isode Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jabber.org/2009/08/xmpp-server-migration/  |

In August 2005, [[Google]] introduced [[Google Talk]], a combination [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] and IM system that uses XMPP for instant messaging and as a base for a voice and file transfer signaling protocol.  (The initial launch did not include [[inter-server|server-to-server]] communications; Google enabled that feature on January 17, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

In September 2008, [[Cisco Systems]] acquired Jabber, Inc., the creators of the commercial product Jabber XCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |

In February 2010, the social-networking site [[Facebook]] opened up its [[Facebook features#Chat|chat feature]] to third-party applications via XMPP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |
url=http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=297991732130 |
title=Facebook Chat Now Available Everywhere |
accessdate=February 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Facebook developers' site notes that Facebook Chat does not actually run an XMPP server internally, but merely presents an XMPP interface to clients; consequently, some server-side features like roster editing cannot be done via XMPP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developers.facebook.com/docs/chat/|title=Facebook Chat API|accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Google Talk, many other public IM services use XMPP, including 

* [[LiveJournal]]'s &quot;LJ Talk&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=270 Question FAQ #270]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Nokia's [[Ovi (Nokia)|Ovi]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://betalabs.nokia.com/betas/view/contacts-ovi Ovi Contacts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, several enterprise IM software products that do not natively use XMPP nevertheless include gateways to XMPP, including 

* [[IBM Lotus Sametime]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lotus Sametime 7.5 Interoperates with AIM, Google Talk&quot;, eWeek, December 6, 2006 [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Messaging-and-Collaboration/Lotus-Sametime-75-Interoperates-with-AIM-Google-Talk/ Eweek.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Lotus ships gateway to integrate IM with AOL, Yahoo, Google&quot;, Network World, December 6, 2006 [http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/120606-sametime-links-up-with-aim.html Networkworld.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strengths ==
;Decentralization
: The architecture of the XMPP network is similar to email; anyone can run their own XMPP server and there is no central master server.
;Open standards
: The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] has formalized XMPP as an approved instant messaging and presence technology under the name of XMPP, and the XMPP specifications have been published as RFC 3920 and RFC 3921. No royalties are required to implement support of these specifications and their development is not tied to a single vendor.
;History
: XMPP technologies have been in use since 1998. Multiple implementations of the XMPP standards exist for clients, servers, components, and code libraries, with the backing of large companies such as [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Google]].
;Security
: XMPP servers may be isolated from the public XMPP network (e.g., on a company intranet), and robust security (via [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]) has been built into the core XMPP specifications. To encourage use of channel encryption, the [http://xmpp.org/ XMPP Standards Foundation] currently runs an intermediate [[Certificate authority|certification authority]] at [http://startssl.com StartSSL] (formerly at [http://xmpp.net xmpp.net]) offering free [[Public key certificate|digital certificates]] to XMPP server administrators under the auspices of the StartCom Certification Authority (which is the root CA for the intermediate CA).
;Flexibility
: Custom functionality can be built on top of XMPP; to maintain interoperability, common extensions are managed by the XMPP Software Foundation. XMPP applications beyond IM include groupchat, network management, content syndication, collaboration tools, file sharing, gaming, remote systems control and monitoring, geolocation, middleware and cloud computing, VoIP and Identity services.

== Weaknesses ==
;In-band binary data transfer is inefficient
: Because XMPP is not yet encoded as [[Efficient XML Interchange]] but as a single long XML document, [[binary data]] must be first [[base64]] encoded before it can be transmitted in-band. Therefore any significant amount of binary data (e.g., [[file transfer]]s) is best transmitted out-of-band, using in-band messages to coordinate. The best example of this is the [[Jingle (protocol)|Jingle XMPP Extension Protocol]], [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html XEP-0166].

== Decentralization and addressing ==
The XMPP network uses a [[Clientâserver model|clientâserver]] architecture (clients do not talk directly to one another).  However, it is decentralizedâby design, there is no central authoritative server, as there is with services such as [[AOL Instant Messenger]] or [[Windows Live Messenger]]. Some confusion often arises on this point as there is a public XMPP server being run at &lt;tt&gt;jabber.org&lt;/tt&gt;, to which a large number of users subscribe.  However, anyone may run their own XMPP server on their own domain. 

Every user on the network has a unique ''Jabber ID'' (usually abbreviated as ''JID''). To avoid requiring a central server to maintain a list of IDs, the JID is structured like an [[e-mail address]] with a username and a [[domain name]] (or [[IP address]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6122 RFC-Standard 6122 for XMPP]&lt;/ref&gt;) for the server where that user resides, separated by an [[at sign]] (&lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt;), such as &lt;tt&gt;username@example.com&lt;/tt&gt;.

Since a user may wish to log in from multiple locations, they may specify a '''resource'''.  A resource identifies a particular client belonging to the user (for example home, work, or mobile). This may be included in the JID by appending a slash followed by the name of the resource. For example, the full JID of a user's mobile account would be &lt;tt&gt;username@example.com/mobile&lt;/tt&gt;.

Each resource may have specified a numerical value called '''priority'''.  Messages simply sent to &lt;tt&gt;username@example.com&lt;/tt&gt; will go to the client with highest priority, but those sent to &lt;tt&gt;username@example.com/mobile&lt;/tt&gt; will go ''only'' to the mobile client.  The highest priority is the one with largest numerical value.

JIDs without a username part are also valid, and may be used for system messages and control of special features on the server.  A resource remains optional for these JIDs as well.

== Connecting to other protocols ==
[[Image:Wie ein Jabber-Transport funktioniert.svg|600px|right|thumb|Alice sends a message through the XMPP net to the ICQ transport. The message is next routed to Bob via the ICQ network.]]
Another useful feature of the XMPP system is that of ''transports'', also known as ''gateways'', which allow users to access networks using other protocols. This can be other instant messaging protocols, but also protocols such as [[SMS]] or [[Email]].  Unlike [[Multiprotocol instant messaging application|multi-protocol clients]], XMPP provides this access at the server level by communicating via special gateway services running on a remote computer.  Any user can &quot;register&quot; with one of these gateways by providing the information needed to log on to that network, and can then communicate with users of that network as though they were XMPP users.  This means any client that fully supports XMPP can access any network with a gateway without extra code in the client, and without the need for the client to have direct access to the Internet. This may violate terms of service on the protocol usedâbut such terms of service are not legally enforceable in several countries. This also requires sending your IM username and password to the third-party site that operates the transport, which may raise privacy concerns.

== XMPP via HTTP transport ==
Another aspect of XMPP is the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] binding for users behind restricted [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]. In the original specification, XMPP could use HTTP in two ways: ''polling''&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0025.html XEP-0025: Jabber HTTP Polling]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''binding''.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html XEP-0124: Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH)]&lt;/ref&gt; The polling method, now deprecated, essentially implies messages stored on a server-side database are being fetched (and posted) regularly by an XMPP client by way of HTTP 'GET' and 'POST' requests. With HTTP binding, the client uses longer-lived HTTP connections to receive messages as soon as they are sent.  This push model of notification is more efficient than polling, where many of the polls return no new data.

Because the client uses HTTP, most firewalls allow clients to fetch and post messages without any hindrances. Thus, in scenarios where the TCP port used by XMPP is blocked, a server can listen on the normal HTTP port and the traffic should pass without problems.  Various websites let people sign in to XMPP via a browser. Furthermore, there are open public servers that listen on standard http (port 80) and https (port 443) ports, and hence allow connections from behind most firewalls.

== Implementations ==
XMPP is implemented by a large number of XMPP [http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients/ clients], [http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/servers/ servers], and [http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/libraries/ code libraries].

== Development ==
The IETF XMPP [[IETF working group|working group]] has produced a number of [[Request for Comments|RFC]] protocol documents:
RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923, RFC 4622, RFC 4854, RFC 4979
* RFC 3920, ''Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Core'', which describes [[Clientâserver model|clientâserver]] messaging using two open-ended [[XML]] streams. XML streams consist of &amp;lt;presence/&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;message/&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;iq/&amp;gt; (info/query). A connection is authenticated with [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer]] (SASL) and [[Encryption|encrypted]] with [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS).
* RFC 3921, ''Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP): Instant Messaging and Presence'' describes [[instant messaging]] (IM), the most common application of XMPP.
* RFC 3922, ''Mapping the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) to Common Presence and Instant Messaging (CPIM)'' relates XMPP and the Common Presence and Instant Messaging (CPIM) specifications.
* RFC 3923, ''End-to-End Signing and Object Encryption for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)'' describes end to end [[encryption]] of XMPP messages using [[S/MIME]]. Conflicting this proposal, many clients currently use [[GNU Privacy Guard|GPG]] for encrypting messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0027.html XEP-0027: Current Jabber OpenPGP Usage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[XMPP Standards Foundation]] (XSF) develops and publishes extensions to XMPP through a standards process centered on ''XMPP Extension Protocols'' (XEPs, previously known as Jabber Enhancement Proposals/JEPs). The following extensions are in especially wide use:
* Data Forms&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html XEP-0004: Data Forms]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Service Discovery&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html XEP-0030: Service Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multi-User Chat&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html XEP-0045: Multi-User Chat]&lt;/ref&gt;
* XHTML-IM&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html XEP-0071: XHTML-IM]&lt;/ref&gt;
* File Transfer&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0096.html XEP-0096: File Transfer]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entity Capabilities&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html XEP-0115: Entity Capabilities]&lt;/ref&gt;
* HTTP Binding&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;
* Personal Eventing Protocol&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html XEP-0163: Personal Eventing Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt;

XMPP is currently being extended to handle signaling / negotiation for [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] and other media sessions. This signaling protocol is called [[Jingle (protocol)|Jingle]]. Jingle is designed to be consistent with the [[Google Talk]] service and bridgeable with the [[Session Initiation Protocol]].
