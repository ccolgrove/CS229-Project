Lizzie spells trouble from the word go and will be causing all kinds of strife in the village.&quot; Of the casting, the show's series producer Blyth said, &quot;Kitty is an extremely talented actress and I'm pleased that she will be joining the show, marking the arrival of such a fascinating character. Lizzie is forthright and fun and she'll soon prove that she isnât afraid to manipulate circumstances to her advantage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;soaps&quot;/&gt;

McGeever later revealed in an interview with ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]'' that she helped to create her new alter ego Lizzie, of this input she explained, &quot;The character was developed by me with the producers. So I had some input. The producers came to see my standup show and Gavin [Blyth] the producer said: 'We want that woman on stage but toned down', because I'm quite outrageous on stage!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a154317/new-dales-star-reveals-character-input.html|title=New Dales star reveals character input|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=29 April 2009|accessdate=2010-07-09|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi MÃ©dias|Hachette Filipacchi UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to [[BBC Radio 4]]âs ''Front Row'' about filling a disabled quota McGeever said, &quot;Iâm not representing anyone, Iâm Kitty McGeever and Iâm just blind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.disabilitynow.org.uk/latest-news2/old-news/blind-first-for-emmerdale?searchterm=kitty+mc|title=Blind first for Emmerdale|date=April 2009|first=Cathy|last=Reay|accessdate=2010-07-09|publisher=[[Disability Now]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
===2009â2010===
Lizzie is first seen in April 2009, when she meets [[Laurel Thomas]] ([[Charlotte Bellamy]]) at community service. Laurel takes pity on Lizzie after realising she is blind, and buys her a meal after Lizzie lies and says she has left her purse on the bus. Lizzie is then reunited with her old friend [[Lisa Dingle]] ([[Jane Cox]]) in the village shop and whilst in the shop she tries to steal some items and puts them into her bag. However, Lisa catches her and asks her to put them back, with Lizzie getting out her purse which she had told Laurel she had lost. When leaving Laurel and [[Ashley Thomas|Ashley's]] ([[John Middleton (actor)|John Middleton]]) Lizzie is taken away by the police after not obeying her curfew. Lizzie moves in with the Dingles but outstays her welcome which annoys [[Zak Dingle]] ([[Steve Halliwell]]) and she soon makes friends in the village. Lizzie makes friends with [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]) and begins to support him in the upcoming council election, but when she is bribed with money she supports [[Eric Pollard]] ([[Chris Chittell]]) instead. She attends a council function for the disabled with him, but they are both removed by security when she is recognised as a thief and her tag is seen.

Lizzie attends [[Natasha Wylde]] ([[Amanda Donohoe]]) and [[Mark Wylde]]'s ([[Maxwell Caulfield]]) vow renewal reception, and belittles [[Marlon Dingle]]'s ([[Mark Charnock]]) catering, knowing that he would cook her another meal too change her opinion of his cooking. Lizzie and Marlon become friends and Marlon asks her too move into Tall Trees Cottage with him which she accepts, much to the annoyance of his brother, [[Eli Dingle|Eli]] ([[Joseph Gilgun]]). Eli doesn't trust Lizzie and begins to follow her to find out where she makes her money. It eventually turns out that she is working on a [[psychic]] hotline and Marlon later discovers that she is, in fact, the psychic that he had been ringing and asking for romantic advice. After he makes Lizzie give back the money he spent on the premium phone calls. When she wins some money on a scratch card, Eli Dingle and [[Jake Doland]] ([[James Baxter]]) trick her in order to keep the winnings themselves. However, Jake feels guilty and owns up, returning the money. In his defence, Eli then observes that Lizzie herself is a con-artist and she starts to question her own behaviour. She and Eli gradually become good friends.

Over time, Lizzie makes more friends in the village, getting a job at David's cleaning firm; however she eventually takes a job at the sweet factory owned by [[Jai Sharma|Jai]] ([[Chris Bisson]]) and [[Nikhil Sharma]] ([[Rik Makarem]]) instead. Lizzie is attacked by an angry [[Aaron Livesy]] ([[Danny Miller (actor)|Danny Miller]]) sending her handbag into the river and causing her to fall to the ground; thinking she has been mugged, Lizzie calls the police. Aaron later returns the bag after fishing it out of the river which Lizzie is grateful for, however he does not accept the reward she offered him. Lizzie is left feeling traumatised by this â vulnerable at her lack of eyesight. Marlon and Eli become very concerned when she refuses to leave the house. Lisa eventually speaks to her and Lizzie confesses that she had once been violently mugged and just how much her blindness scares her under all the bravado. Lizzie is intimidated when a desperate [[Shadrach Dingle]] ([[Andy Devine (English actor)|Andy Devine]]) hassles her for money for alcohol when they are alone.

Lizzie starts to grow close to [[Bob Hope]] ([[Tony Audenshaw]]). Lizzie hears [[Viv Hope]] ([[Deena Payne]]) and [[Brenda Walker]] ([[Lesley Dunlop]]) doubting his interest in her and begins avoiding him. Later, Lizzie develops feelings for Bob as they spend more time together. When [[Hazel Rhodes]] ([[Pauline Quirke]]) tells Bob that Lizzie has feelings for him, Lizzie is upset when Bob tells her that they are just friends.

In December 2010 her and Bob try to cheer up Marlon after him falling out with his best friend [[Paddy Kirk]] ([[Dominic Brunt]]) because Paddy was seeing Marlon's ex [[Rhona Goskirk]] ([[Zoe Henry]]). She pretends to go ice skating with her friend Toni, but she actually sets up drinks, pizza and games, for Marlon and Paddy to make up - which they do.

===2011â===
In 2011 Lizzie is unaware that [[Derek Benrose]] ([[Stephen Bent]]) had raped her close friend, Lisa Dingle. After Lisa had been raped, Derek starts flirting with Lizzie and Lizzie is flattered with the attention she is getting from Derek, when Lisa tries to tell Lizzie that he is messing with her, Lizzie tells her to back off and thinks she is jelous that the man Lisa used to flirt with was paying someone else attenton. The later on in that week, Nikhill asks someone to do over time and Derek volunteers himself and Lizzie, Lisa is worried by this because he thinks that Derek might rape Lizzie, so Lisa puts a stop to it by finally revealling that Derek raped her, he is suspended pending an investigation and Lizzie feels guilty because she blocked her best friend out when she needed to talk to someone, she apologises to Lisa and they make up and since then Lizzie has taken a distinct dislike to Derek and she, Lisa and everyone else was happy when Derek was sent down for rape.

==Reception==
Disabled charity Leonard Cheshire Disability praised the decision to sign the first blind actress to be cast in a UK soap, John Knight the charity's assistant director of policy and campaigns, said of the move, &quot;We applaud the decision by ''Emmerdale'' to champion the country's first ever blind soap actress.
