__FORCETOC__
The '''2010&amp;ndash;11 South Florida Bulls men's basketball team''' represented the [[University of South Florida]] [[South Florida Bulls|Bulls]] during the [[2010â11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]].

==Off season==
During the off-season, there were several important milestones for the USF basketball program.  In March, ground was broken on the Muma Basketball Center; a {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, basketball practice facility, adjacent to the USF Sun Dome. Construction is expected to be completed by the end of spring 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&amp;ATCLID=204900191&lt;/ref&gt; In June, [[Dominique Jones]] became the highest player ever drafted to the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] from USF. He was selected in the first round, as the 25th overall pick by the [[Memphis Grizzlies]], and then traded to the [[Dallas Mavericks]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=7700&amp;ATCLID=204963867&amp;SPID=2923&amp;SPSID=36686&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the team represented the United States in Brazil for the 2010 Pan American University Championships. They took home the silver medal, losing in the finals to Brazil, and finishing with a record of 4-1. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&amp;ATCLID=204943624&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=7700&amp;ATCLID=204974928&amp;SPID=2923&amp;SPSID=36686&lt;/ref&gt; At Big East Media day in October, the Bulls were selected to finish in 13th place in the Big East Preseason Coaches' Poll.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/214542/Pittsburgh-Chosen-As-BIG-EAST-Hoops-Favorite.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
