'''ÂµTorrent''' (or '''uTorrent'''; commonly abbreviated as &quot;'''ÂµT'''&quot; or &quot;'''uT'''&quot;) is a [[freeware]], [[closed source]] [[BitTorrent client]] owned by [[BitTorrent (company)|BitTorrent, Inc]]. It is the most widely used BitTorrent client outside China, where [[Xunlei]] is more popular. It gets the &quot;[[Âµ]]&quot; in its name from the [[SI prefix]] &quot;[[micro-]]&quot;, referring to the program's small [[memory footprint]]: the program is designed to use minimal computer resources while offering functionality comparable to larger BitTorrent clients such as [[Vuze]] or [[BitComet]].

The program has received consistently good reviews for its feature set, performance, stability, and support for older hardware and versions of Windows. A report showed that ÂµTorrent is the second most popular BitTorrent client (after the Chinese [[Xunlei]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Thunder Blasts uTorrentâs Market Share Away | publisher = [[TorrentFreak]] | date = 2009-12-04 | url = http://torrentfreak.com/thunder-blasts-utorrents-market-share-away-091204/ | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is available for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]. A '''ÂµTorrent Server''' is available for [[Linux]]. All versions are written in [[C++]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FAQ: How can ÂµTorrent be so small and so fast? | publisher = BitTorrent, Inc. | date = | url = http://www.utorrent.com/faq/misc#faq14 | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program has been in active development since its first release in 2005. Although originally developed by [[Ludvig Strigeus]], since December 7, 2006, the code is owned and maintained by BitTorrent, Inc.&lt;ref name=&quot;purchase&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = BitTorrent Inc Buys uTorrent | publisher = [[TorrentFreak]] | date = 2006-12-07 | url = http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-inc-buys-%C2%B5torrent/ | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code has also been employed by BitTorrent, Inc. as the basis for version 6.0 and above of the [[BitTorrent (software)|BitTorrent client]], a re-branded version of ÂµTorrent.

==History==
===Early development===
Out of general discontent with [[bloatware]], Serge Paquet suggested to [[Ludvig Strigeus]] that he should make a small and efficient BitTorrent client. Strigeus began to conceptualize the plans for the program's development, which, at the time, did not include making the client feature-rich. After initially working on it for about a month during the last quarter of 2004 (the first build is dated October 17, 2004), mostly during his free time before and after work, Strigeus ceased coding ÂµTorrent for a year. He resumed work on September 15, 2005, and three days later, the first public release (version 1.1 beta) was made available as [[freeware]], and began generating feedback.

===PeerFactor SARL===
On March 4, 2006, PeerFactor SARL announced the signing of a six-month contract with Strigeus for the development of &quot;new content distribution applications on the Web.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slickpeerfactorSARL&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = uTorrent Sign Six Month PeerFactor Agreement | publisher = [[Slyck.com]] | date = 2006-03-04 | url = http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=1117 | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; PeerFactor SARL is a relatively new company formed by former employees of PeerFactor, which was a subsidiary of the French anti-piracy organization [[Retspan]].

Ludde stated that his coding for PeerFactor SARL was to use his expertise at optimization of the BitTorrent [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] to create a [[Dynamic-link library|.dll]] which PeerFactor SARL intended to use as part of a distribution platform for files in a corporate setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = uTorrent, PeerFactor deal | publisher = [[p2pnet]] | date = 2006-03-04 | url = http://www.p2pnet.net/story/8158 | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time there was some speculation that Î¼Torrent may have been modified to spy on users on Peerfactor's behalf,&lt;ref name=&quot;slickpeerfactorSARL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bizarre uTorrent, PeerFactor deal | publisher = [[p2pnet]] | date = 2006-03-06 | url = http://www.p2pnet.net/story/8097 | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; however to date (even following Î¼Torrent's acquisition by BitTorrent, Inc.) no evidence has been produced to support these allegations.

===Ownership change===
On December 7, 2006, ÂµTorrent was purchased by BitTorrent, Inc., as it was announced on their official forum.&lt;ref name=&quot;purchase&quot;/&gt;

On September 18, 2007, [[BitTorrent (software)|BitTorrent]] 6.0 was released, which is a re-branded version of ÂµTorrent. As a result, BitTorrent 6 is closed-source (unlike BitTorrent 5.x and before, which were [[open source software]]).

===Paid version===
On July 15, 2011, BitTorrent announced that they would offer a paid version of ÂµTorrent called &quot;ÂµTorrent Plus&quot;. This new version, which was expected to be released in &quot;late fall&quot; 2011, would offer extra features, such as integrated file conversion, anti-virus and a built in media player.&lt;ref name=&quot;ÂµTorrent plus anouncement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Now Taking Reservations â ÂµTorrent Plus|url=http://blog.bittorrent.com/2011/07/15/1173/|work=Official BitTorrent blog|publisher=BitTorrent. Inc.|accessdate=2011-7-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October 2011, the [[Pre-alpha|Pre-alpha]] of ÂµTorrent Plus was released to an invite only community.&lt;ref name=&quot;ÂµTorrent plus update&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ÂµTorrent Plus Update|url=http://blog.bittorrent.com/2011/10/06/%c2%b5torrent-plus-update/|work=Official BitTorrent blog|publisher=BitTorrent. Inc.|accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2011, the program was still in [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha stage]].

===Size===
ÂµTorrent is shipped as a single stand-alone [[executable compression|compressed executable]] file, installed at first run. Recent versions have included the ability to install themselves on first run. Small executable size is achieved by avoiding the use of many [[library (computer science)|libraries]], notably the C++ standard library and [[iostream|stream facilities]], and creating substitutes written specifically for the program. The executable is then compressed to roughly half of its compiled and linked size using [[UPX]].

===Operating system support===
[[file:Î¼TorrentMac.png|thumb|Screenshot of the Mac OS X version of Î¼Torrent (up to 0.9.2)]]
[[file:UTorrentLinux.png|thumb|Screenshot of Î¼Torrent Server viewed in Firefox]]

ÂµTorrent is available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FAQ: Is there a Linux or Mac version? | publisher = BitTorrent, Inc. | date = | url = http://www.utorrent.com/faq#faq3 | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first test version for Mac OS X, running on [[Mac OS X 10.5]], was released on 27 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = uTorrent Releases Long-Awaited Mac Version | publisher = [[TorrentFreak]] | date = 2008-11-27 | url = http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-releases-mac-version-081127/ | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2, 2010, the native [[Linux]] version of ÂµTorrent Server was released. An administrator said that they have been working on this project for a few months prior to the release as it was the most requested feature for some time. This release is intended for users who are seeking a fast [[command-line interface]] based [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] client with a remote web-based management. They also mentioned that a full featured client with a [[GUI]] is a work in progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;utorrent1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Forum: ÂµTorrent Server 3.0 alpha build 21886 (for Linux) | publisher = BitTorrent, Inc. | date = 2010-09-02 | url = http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?pid=517212#p517212 | accessdate = 2010-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firon also said ''This is a native Linux port and is known to work on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 9.10+, [[Debian]] 5+ and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] 12+. Others may work, but they are not officially supported. Kernel 2.6.13 or newer required. 64-bit host systems currently have some problems, so 32-bit only for now. For trackers who whitelist, the user agent is &quot;uTorrent/300B(build#)(server)&quot;. The peerid is identical to the Windows 3.0 client. They share version numbers because of a common codebase.''&lt;ref name=&quot;utorrent1&quot;/&gt;

==Revenue==
In early versions, Strigeus had built in a web redirection via nanotorrent for search queries entered through the search bar that displayed advertisements in a frame on the web browser. Some users thought this suspicious because tracking could be implemented by recording the [[IP address]]es of those downloading/receiving the advertisements, and the search functionality could easily be used to track user queries through whichever web-interface the client is going through to execute the search. After a short trial period, the advertising was disabled,&lt;!-- what version of ÂµTorrent had it and which version disabled it? --&gt; mitigating possible concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Forum: The search bypass nanotorrent.com (post by Admin &quot;Firon&quot;) | publisher = BitTorrent, Inc. | date = | url = http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?pid=53755#p53755 | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A later version of the software has, instead of ads, a &quot;search all sites&quot; feature, which is a keyword-based search bar that delivers listings of torrent files at different trackers. A frame at the top displays advertisements (server-side) in the browser when the search function is used. In version 1.5, no ads are present in the program itself.

As of build 463, a redirect bypass feature became available in the Advanced options.

As of version 1.8.2, the ÂµTorrent installer gives the user the option to download and install the [[Ask.com toolbar]]. This is done on the first run of the program and the user may explicitly opt out of this feature by deselecting it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Forum: ÂµTorrent 1.8.2 released | publisher = BitTorrent, Inc. | date = 2009-01-24 | url = http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?id=52947 | accessdate = 2009-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = uTorrent Is Going to Make Money With a Toolbar | publisher = [[TorrentFreak]] | date = 2009-04-22 | url = http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-is-going-to-make-money-090422/ | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers stated the addition was needed for funds to continue development. In late 2010, this was replaced with the [[Conduit (publisher network and platform)|Conduit Engine]].

==Pronunciation==
The author of ÂµTorrent wrote in 2005, &quot;I usually say 'you torrent' because it looks like a u&quot;, and offered &quot;microtorrent&quot;, &quot;mytorrent&quot; (as &quot;my&quot; {{IPA|[myË]}} is the Swedish pronunciation of the Greek letter Âµ) and later &quot;mutorrent&quot; as alternate pronunciations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Forum: ÂµTorrent Namesake (post by creator &quot;Ludde&quot;) | publisher = [[Ludvig Strigeus]] | date = 2005-09-20 | url = http://forum.utorrent.com/viewtopic.php?pid=47#p47 | accessdate = 2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol Î¼ is the lowercase [[Greek language|Greek]] letter [[Mu (letter)|Mu]], which stands for the [[SI prefix]] &quot;[[micro-]]&quot; meaning &quot;one millionth&quot;; it refers to the program's small footprint.

The [[English pronunciation of Greek letters|traditional English pronunciation]] of the letter Î¼ is /ËmjuË/ (as in the English word 'mew'), derived from its [[Ancient Greek phonology|Classical Greek pronunciation]] {{IPA-el|mÅ·Ë|}} (impossible to represent accurately with [[Pronunciation respelling for English|&quot;sound-alike&quot; respelling]], since English lacks the [[close front rounded vowel]] [y]). The corresponding [[Modern Greek phonology|Standard Modern Greek pronunciation]] is {{IPA-el|mi|}}, much like the English word 'me'.

==Contributors==
Original development was performed by [[Ludvig Strigeus]] (&quot;ludde&quot;, from [[Sweden]]), the creator of ÂµTorrent. Serge Paquet (&quot;vurlix&quot;, from [[Canada]]) acted as release coordinator, and had intended to work on Linux and Mac OS X ports. He maintained the ÂµTorrent website and forum up until the end of 2005, but is no longer affiliated with ÂµTorrent.

Development after the purchase by BitTorrent is performed by developers Adam Kennedy (&quot;AdamK&quot;), Arvid Norberg (&quot;arvid&quot;, author of [[Libtorrent (Rasterbar)|libtorrent]]), Greg Hazel (&quot;alus&quot;), Jan Brittenson (&quot;CodeRed&quot;), Richard Choi (&quot;rchoi&quot;), and Ryan Norton (&quot;RyanNorton&quot;) at BitTorrent Inc. Strigeus remains as a technical consultant.

Other tasks continue to be performed by ongoing contributors. Giancarlo MartÃ­nez (&quot;Firon&quot;, from [[Puerto Rico]]) maintains the ÂµTorrent forums and FAQ. Carsten Niebuhr (&quot;Directrix&quot;, from [[Germany]]) developed the original ÂµTorrent Web User Interface which is now maintained by &quot;Ultima&quot;.

==Reception==
Î¼Torrent has been praised for its small size and the minimal computer resources it uses which sets it apart from other clients.

==Conduit Toolbar controversy==	
As of late 2010, some controversy has arisen with the release of a new version of the uTorrent client. The installation now includes [[adware]] in the form of the Conduit Engine, which installs a toolbar and makes homepage and default search engine changes to the user's browser. While most have had the option to opt-out of this feature, some users have reported that this installation is made without the user's consent, either installing this software and making these changes without notifying the user, or still going ahead after the user has explicitly opted out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = uTorrent Browser Toolbar Mystery Causes Confusion | publisher = [[Torrentfreak]] | date = 2010-12-18 | url = http://torrentfreak.com/utorrent-browser-toolbar-mystery-causes-havoc-among-users-101218/ | accessdate = 2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there have been complaints that the software is extremely difficult to remove once installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = So long, uTorrent | publisher = First Arkansas News | date = 2010-12-15 | url = http://firstarkansasnews.net/2010/12/so-long-utorrent/ | accessdate = 2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
