'''''Major League Baseball on TBS''''' is a presentation of [[Major League Baseball]] games produced by [[Turner Sports]] and airing on the television channel [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]].

==History==
===Pre-2007: relationship with the Braves===
{{See also|Braves TBS Baseball}}

[[Atlanta Braves]] baseball games had been a local staple on Atlanta station [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]] (which were both owned by [[Ted Turner]]), and subsequently nationally with the launch of its national feed, one of America's first [[superstation]]s. Along with [[WGN-TV]], the station was one of the few broadcasting local sports broadcasts nationally, with some even giving the Braves the title &quot;[[America's Team]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1982/0809.html|last=Wulf|first=Steve|title=America's Team II|date=1982-08-09|publisher=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Major League Baseball realigned to three divisions in each league in {{mlby|1994}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessnews.com/_news/news_347260.php|title=Going Inside MLBâs latest US$3 billion TV agreements|work=Sports Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBS offered Major League Baseball [[United States dollar|$]]40-$45 million a year for rights to another round of playoffs (presumably, the newly created [[Division Series]]). Instead, Major League Baseball along with [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] formed a revenue sharing [[joint venture]] called [[The Baseball Network]] (which was abolished after the [[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995 season]]). Meanwhile, [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]] was offering $130 million a year to renew its previous contract ({{mlby|1990}}-{{mlby|1993}}) before being shut out, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/72750573.html?dids=72750573:72750573&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+06%2C+1995&amp;author=Rudy+Martzke&amp;pub=USA+TODAY+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=McCarver+prefers+all+4+games&amp;pqatl=google|title=McCarver prefers all 4 games|date=October 6, 1995|first=Rudy|last=Martzke|newspaper=USA Today|authorlink=Rudy Martzke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2003 Atlanta Braves season|2003]], Braves games on TBS began to undergo significant change for the first time in many years. These changes reflected increased rights fee payments to Major League Baseball. In turn, national sponsors could fulfill their advertising commitments by purchasing ads on TBS, in addition to [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] or [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]. In the process, they let [[Don Sutton]] and [[Joe Simpson (broadcaster)|Joe Simpson]] be the lead commentators, while longtime play-by-play men [[Skip Caray]] and [[Pete Van Wieren]] had their roles cut back. This was done in an attempt to combat criticism of Caray's on-air &quot;home team&quot; bias and to market its baseball coverage to non-Braves fans. Meanwhile, the slogan '''''Braves Baseball on TBS''''' was replaced by '''''Major League Baseball on TBS'''''. The move was strongly criticized by Braves fans, the local Atlanta media, and Braves manager [[Bobby Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030413165851/http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/sports/braves/0303/27braves.html accessatlanta.com/ajc/sports/braves/0303/27braves.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90[[Percentage|%]] of Braves fans who voted in an online poll conducted by the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' preferred Caray and Van Wieren to the more neutral broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030412191153/www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/sports/braves/0303/26tv.html accessatlanta.com/ajc/sports/braves/0303/26braves.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The move backfired, and ratings for the TBS broadcasts declined sharply. After the [[2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Break]], TBS brought back Skip and Pete to work with the two analysts, while in the following year, the title reverted back to ''Braves Baseball on TBS''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===2007: Going national===
Under an agreement signed on July 11, 2006, [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] earned exclusive rights to all [[Division Series]] playoff games, one of the [[League Championship Series]], as well as rights to the ''[[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Selection Show]]'' held in late June or early July, from 2007&amp;ndash;2013. A national Sunday afternoon baseball package was also planned starting in the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008]] season. As a part of the deal, it was decided that Atlanta Braves games would now only air locally. On October 1, 2007, WTBS severed its ties with the TBS network to become an [[Independent station (North America)|independent]] under the call letters [[WPCH-TV]], branding as ''Peachtree TV''. Along with this, the national TBS feed became available in Atlanta for the first time. Peachtree TV still airs Braves games, but only within the team's market and in [[Canada]] due to local laws currently not allowing the &quot;cable&quot; TBS to be shown unbundled in Canada. TBS' games are shown on [[Rogers Sportsnet]] in Canada.

Since the regular season package began, several contests aired on TBS have featured the Braves. On October 7, 2010, TBS covered their first Braves postseason game since the start of the package: Game 1 of the [[2010 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] against the [[2010 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] (a 1-0 win for the Giants).

On the July 2, 2011 edition of ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular|The CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', TBS' Atlanta based Major League Baseball studio crew of [[Matt Winer]], [[Dennis Eckersley]], [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] and [[David Wells]] presented a [[2011 Major League Baseball season|2011 Major League Baseball]] midseason report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fangsbites.com/2011/06/cbs-sports-spectacular-to-borrow-turner-sports-mlb-crew-on-saturday/ |title=CBS Sports Spectacular To Borrow Turner Sports MLB Crew on Saturday |author=Fang, Ken |date=30 June 2011 |work=Fangsbites.com |publisher=Wordpress |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by ''MLB 2011: Down the Stretch'', which aired on September 24&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_network/release?id=29231 |title=CBS SPECTACULAR AND TBS LOOK AT MLB'S STRETCH DRIVE ON SATURDAY, SEPT. 24 |author= |date=21 September 2011 |work=CBS PressExpress |publisher= |accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. CBS Sports and [[Turner Sports]] have in the past, teamed up on coverage of the [[NCAA March Madness (CBS/Turner)|NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] and the [[Olympics on TNT|Winter Olympics]] in [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992]], [[1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998]].

==Scheduling==
TBS typically begins coverage with the pregame show ''MLB on Deck'', followed by the first pitch of the first game about 38 minutes later. Each day's coverage ends with ''Inside MLB'', its version of ''[[Inside the NBA]]''. TBS does not show commercial breaks after the third, and sixth innings (and also after the 9th inning when the game goes to extra innings). Instead, it airs a &quot;Game Break&quot; allowing the studio host and analysts more air time (similar to what is done for British television coverage of an American sporting event). The studio shows originate from Studio J in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], the same one used for [[NBA on TNT|TNT's NBA coverage]].

===Regular season===
During the regular season, TBS broadcasts a weekly game nationally on Sunday afternoons, under the title ''Sunday MLB on TBS''.  These games are not exclusive to TBS and are [[blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] in local markets to protect local broadcasters. Under the deal, TBS can show an alternate game in those markets, but the network has elected not to do so thus far. Also, despite initial reports that TBS would carry games on [[Memorial Day]], the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]], and [[Labor Day]], these holiday games are not part of the contract. For many years, games on these holidays were shown on [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]], but that network has discontinued them (with the occasional exception of when they fall into the regular Sunday/Monday/Wednesday night slots) in favor of other live sports events.

TBS released a partial schedule of its inaugural slate of Sunday games on February 27, 2008. More games would be added as the season progressed, generally two weeks before each telecast date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080227&amp;content_id=2392359&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=TBS releases 2008 baseball schedule|author=Singer, Tom|publisher=MLB.com|date=2008-02-27|accessdate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBS has the second pick of game after ESPN.

Consequently, due to its non-exclusivity, highlights of a scheduled game aired on ''MLB on TBS'' were not shown on the [[ESPN]] baseball highlight show ''[[Baseball Tonight]]''; instead local broadcasts of the scheduled game were shown. However, highlights of an ''MLB on TBS'' game do air on the ''[[Major League Baseball on Fox|MLB on FOX]]'' weekly program ''[[This Week in Baseball]]'', as well as ''[[MLB Tonight]]'' on the [[MLB Network]].

===Postseason===
Before the postseason, TBS will air any tie-breaker games for divisional or [[Major League Baseball Wild Card|wild card]] championships. Should multiple tie-breaking games be played, or if multiple Division Series games are going on at the same time, those additional games air on TBSâ sister station, [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]. If the tie-breaker game for the [[American League East]] or the [[List of American League Wild Card winners|American League Wild Card]] is between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]], then that game will air on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Contract&quot;/&gt;

All games in the Division Series round are presented back-to-back, with each game scheduled for a {{frac|3|1|2}}-hour window. If a game exceeds this window, the first pitch of the next game will be switched to [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]. If a game ends within {{frac|3|1|2}} hours, the studio team will return for interstitial programming.&lt;ref&gt;[[DirecTV]] onscreen program guide, retrieved September 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; TBS' League Championship Series coverage will alternate yearly. TBS will air the ALCS in 2012 and the NLCS in 2013, alternating with [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Contract&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/70495-dear-mlb-we-need-to-talk-about-your-tbs-contract|title=Dear MLB, We Need to Talk About Your TBS Contract|first=Scott|last=Stanton|work=Bleacher Report|date=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if TBS is scheduled to air the ALCS, and the two teams playing are the [[YankeesâRed Sox rivalry|New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox]], then MLB might move the ALCS to Fox and broadcast the NLCS on TBS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Contract&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, TBS switched the starts of four games to TNT in the Division Series round because the previous games exceeded the time limit. TNT was also scheduled to air Game 4 of the [[2007 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Diamondbacks]]â[[2007 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] series, which overlapped with Game 3 of the [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]]â[[2007 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] series, but the former game was not played; the night before, the Diamondbacks completed a three game sweep of the Cubs.&lt;!--How many conflicts were there from 2008 to 2010?--&gt;

TNT was scheduled to air three entire Division Series games in [[2011 Major League Baseball season|2011]] due to conflicts with TBS. On October 1, it aired Game 2 of the [[2011 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] vs. the [[2011 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] at 7 p.m. ET, which overlapped with the end of Game 1 of the [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] vs. the [[2011 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] and the continuation of Game 1 of the [[2011 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] vs. the [[2011 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] on TBS. (The latter was also to have been Game 2, but Game 1 was suspended after {{frac|1|1|2}} innings due to rain.) On October 2, it aired the rescheduled Game 2 between the Tigers and the Yankees at 3 p.m. ET, two hours before Game 2 of the [[2011 Arizona Diamondbacks season|Arizona Diamondbacks]] vs. the [[2011 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] on TBS. On October 4, it aired Game 3 of the Diamondbacks vs. the Brewers at 9:30 p.m. ET, one hour after Game 3 of the Tigers vs. the Yankees started on TBS.

==Criticism of TBS' coverage==
TBS' coverage has been met with criticism by some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indenvertimes.com/tbs-takes-away-postseason-luster-for-baseball-fans|title=TBS takes away postseason luster for baseball fans|author=Martin, David|publisher=In Denver Times|date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with TNT's NBA playoff coverage, MLB playoff games on TBS are not made available to local over-the-air broadcasters in the participating teams' markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2007-10-09-hiestand-column_N.htm|title=Fox's Buck makes pitch for late show|last=Hiestand|first=Michael|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the previous contract, [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] was required to make those games available on the air in local markets.

Some sports media critics were critical of the announcers used in the coverage as being more skewed towards the National League than the American League,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/68049-dear-tbs-please-stick-to-dawsons-creek-reruns-or-just-shoot-me|title=Dear TBS: Please Stick to Dawson's Creek Reruns or Just Shoot Me|author=Stanton, Scott|work=Bleacher Report|date=October 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the choice of [[Chip Caray]] (who along the way was criticized for making factual mistakes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/more_sports/caray_is_master_of_the_miscue_3ivfDRXM5ic24vYmdORkQK|title=Caray is master of the miscue|author=Mushnick, Phil|publisher=[[The New York Post]]|date=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/2009-10-08-tv-sports-chip-caray_N.htm|title=Odd miscalls by TBS' Chip Caray|author=Kimball, Bob|publisher=[[USA Today]]|date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during postseason broadcasts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/sports/baseball/09sandomir.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=chip%20caray&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin|title=An Error-Plagued Game, but From the Broadcast Booth|author=Sandomir, Richard|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/sports/baseball/09sandomir.html|title=Chip Caray Is in a Verbal Slump in the TBS Booth|author=Sandomir, Richard|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as the lead voice of the network's coverage, as he had only done Braves baseball telecasts in the 2007 season before the launch of TBS' playoff coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandomir 10/10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Yes, There Is Crying in Baseball (and It's O.K.)|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/sports/baseball/10sandomir.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1192035676-0y2WonwlYJgt+BJP2TgIJg|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; TBS and Caray parted ways following the 2009 playoffs.

TBS missed most of the first inning of Game 6 of the [[2008 American League Championship Series]], with viewers getting a rerun of ''[[The Steve Harvey Show]]'' instead.  TBS picked up the game just prior to the last out in the bottom of the first, with announcer Chip Caray apologizing to viewers for &quot;technical difficulties.&quot; TBS acknowledged there was a problem with one of their routers used in the broadcast transmission of the relay of the telecast from Atlanta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081018&amp;content_id=3629863&amp;vkey=ps2008news&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Game 6 TV broadcast interrupted|date=October 19, 2008|accessdate=2009-07-31|first=Bryan|last=Hoch|work=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/19/sports/baseball/19notes.html?ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=print|title=On TBS, Long Wait for Gameâs First Pitch|date=October 19, 2008|first=Richard|last=Sandomir|newspaper=The New York Times|page=SP3|authorlink=Richard Sandomir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the TBS' coverage of Game 1 of the [[2011 American League Division Series]] between the [[2011 Texas Rangers season|Texas Rangers]] and [[2011 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]], TBS was alleged to have featured fake headlines that were plagiarized by real journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/mlb/not-again-this-time-its-tbs-fabricating-headlines-and-plagiarizing-real-journalists/|title=Not Again: This Time Itâs TBS Fabricating Headlines (And Plagiarizing Real Journalists)|author=Stanton, Scott|work=SportsGrid|date=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, during the middle of an at-bat during Game 1 of the 2011 ALDS between the [[2011 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] and [[2011 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]], TBS suddenly cut to Tampa Bay-Texas game, which was airing on TNT for about 14 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/sportsmedia/some-strange-happenings-on-tbs-baseball-telecast/7865/|title=Some strange happenings on TBS baseball telecast|author=Dougherty, Pete Scott|work=timesunion.com|date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moments later (as TBS was coming out of a replay and showing the Tigers' dugout), cameras missed Yankees right fielder [[Nick Swisher]] making a diving catch (instead showing Yankees pitcher [[IvÃ¡n Nova]] walking off the mound and pumping his fist). 

TBS has also been criticized for placing the center-field camera precisely in the center. Therefore, every time a pitcher began his windup, his head would block the view of home plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/sportsmedia/tbs-continues-to-fumble-the-ball-in-mlb-postseason/7905/|title=TBS continues to fumble the ball in MLB postseason|author=Dougherty, Pete Scott|work=timesunion.com|date=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital on-screen graphics==
{{see also|Baseball telecasts technology}}

Before TBS' broadcast the 2007 postseason, they used a score bug on the top left-hand corner of the screen for their [[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] telecasts.  It has been upgraded midway into the 2004 season to what it was through 2007.

===2007-2010===
The on-screen score graphic&lt;ref name=&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=TBS takes its shots|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/richard_deitsch/10/10/tbs.baseball/index.html|author=Deitsch, Richard|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=2007-10-11|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; covers the entire top of the screen, unlike the ''[[Braves TBS Baseball]]'' graphic, which only took up the left half of the top. The look is almost identical to that of from [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox's baseball coverage]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;/&gt; except that the illustration of the basepaths is near the left side of the screen instead of flush on the right. The batting order starting lineup used since 2008 resembles that of a [[cellular telephone|cellphone]]. There is also a pitch tracker that can only be seen on high-definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball On TBS: Best HD Ever|url=http://www.tvpredictions.com/tbs100411.htm|author=Swanni|work=TVPredictions.com|date=2011-10-04|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; feeds.

===2011-===
With the start of the 2011 postseason, TBS planned to introduce the following&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fangsbites.com/2011/09/turner-sports-unveils-coverage-plans-announcing-teams-for-mlb-postseason/ |title=Turner Sports Unveils Coverage Plans &amp; Announcing Teams for MLB Postseason |author=Fang, Ken |date=30 September 2011 |work=Fangsbites.com |publisher=Worldpress.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg Stats]]: TBS would use Bloomberg States as means to integrate comprehensive statistical information into each telecast. 
*[[Vizrt|Liberovision]]: This is an innovative 3D interactive [[telestrator]] meant to give fans a new perspective of instant replays. 
*New graphics that intend to feature improved functionality with a nostalgic feel.
*Pitch Trax: An in-game technology that illustrates pitch location throughout the games.

The screen on TBS's [[standard definition television|standard definition]] [[4:3]] feed now airs a [[letterbox]]ed version of the native HD feed to match Fox's default [[widescreen]] SD presentation, allowing the right side pitch tracking graphic to be seen by SD viewers.
