The '''Winnipeg Wesmen''' are the athletic teams that represent the [[University of Winnipeg]] in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Canada]]. As an undergraduate school, currently the University of Winnipeg's Wesmen participate only in the sports of [[Basketball]], [[Volleyball]] and [[Soccer]] in both the men's and women's side. They play all their games at the [[Duckworth Centre]] which is located directly beside the university in downtown Winnipeg. The University of Winnipeg Wesmen have led the Canada West Conference in attendance every year helped in part to devoted fans, alumni, and the downtown location of the Duckworth Centre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/release-080201 Attendance&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIS Championships==

Volleyball has always been a popular sport in Manitoba and the University of Winnipeg Wesmen and [[University of Manitoba Bisons]] have frequently battled for the [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]] title. The Wesmen women hold the record with 7 national titles and were the first to win 6 consecutive titles between 1983 and 1988, this was a feat that was only later repeated once by the [[Alberta Pandas|University of Alberta Pandas]].

In recent years the men's volleyball side won the CIS championships for the 2006-07 season, defeating the [[University of Alberta]] 3 sets to 2, the following year in a rematch of the same final the Wesmen lost 3 sets to 1 finishing runner-up to Alberta this time.

In women's basketball the ladies made it to the national final against [[Simon Fraser University|Simon Fraser]] in 2004-05 losing the final 60-50. The year before in the bronze medal match between the same two schools the Wesmen ladies won 65-62
