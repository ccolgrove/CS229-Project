==''Basset'' class trawlers==
The trawler ''Basset'', built in 1935, became the prototype for nearly 250 military trawlers built in the following ten years. The ''Basset'' class trawlers were minesweeping trawlers built to a British design in India. A modified version of the ''Basset'' class was built in Canada with extra ice strengthening and known as the [[Fundy class minesweeper]]s.

==Requisitioned trawlers==
There were also 215 trawlers of specific class &lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/warships/class.html?ID=332 uboat.net - Allied Warships - ASW Trawlers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These were commercial trawlers taken over by the Admiralty. The Royal Navy classified requisitioned trawlers by manufacturer, although such classes were more diverse than traditional naval classifications. 72 ships of this class were lost.
