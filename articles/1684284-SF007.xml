}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 36% of the districtâs urban population lives in the town alone. It has witnessed roughly 23% population growth during 1991â2001 decade.

Its official name is Beed, though; Bhir, Bir, BÄ«r, Bid or BÄ«d can also be seen sometimes in official and unofficial documents and seals. Some references like [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]] refer it as ''Bhir'', [[Encyclopedia Encarta]] as ''BÄ«r'' and [[Google Maps]] as ''Bir'' while it is found at [[World Gazetteer]] as ''BÄ«d''.
In 1990s during the government of right wing Hindu party [[Shiv Sena]] in Maharashtra, Beed town was proposed to be renamed as ''Champavatinagar'', which is said to be its old name.

Beed's early history is obscure. Historians speculate based on archaeological remains that the town might have been founded by the Yadava rulers (1173â1317) of Devagiri (now [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]]). Beed town was a part of the State of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] (''Asaf Jahi Kingdom'') of [[Nizam]]s. After independence the state was annexed to India in September 1948 following a military action. Beed remained in Hyderabad state until 1956 when it was included in [[Bombay Presidency]]. On May 1, 1960 [[Maharashtra]] state was created on linguistic basis and Marathi dominant Beed town became part of Maharashtra.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLACE_BHIR&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

There are several historical buildings located in the town of which Kankaleshwar temple is the most famous. There are remains of citadel wall which protect a part of the old town from rare but violent floods of Bendsura river.
As district headquarters, the town has several district and local administrative offices including district and municipal councils, district and session courts and offices of district collector and superintendent of police. Hospitals, schools and colleges including professional training colleges are also located in the town.

==Topography and Climate==
{{wide image|Beed_Panorama.jpg|3000px|&lt;center&gt;''Panoramic view of a part of Beed town from the eastern hills on a rainy day.''&lt;/center&gt;}}
Beed is situated on the [[Deccan Plateau]] {{Coord|18.99|N|75.76|E|}}, on the banks of ''Bendsura'' river (also called ''Bindusara'') which is a sub-tributary of [[Godavari]] river. Bendsura originates in the hills of Balaghat range, 30&amp;nbsp;km south-west of the town near the village of ''Waghira''. The river divides the town into smaller eastern and larger western parts. Balaghat Range stretches very close, up to 10&amp;nbsp;km south of the town making terrain; mainly in the eastern part, undulating. Soil is coarse and rocky largely consisting of basalt. Thin layers of fertile black soil are also seen in the northern part and in the south at the western bank of Bendsura. The town has [[Semi-arid]], hot and dry climate consisting of mainly three seasons. Summers are long, ranging almost five months from mid February to June. Temperatures in summer fall between 31&amp;nbsp;Â°C (87.8&amp;nbsp;Â°F) - 40&amp;nbsp;Â°C (104&amp;nbsp;Â°F) (1997 average). However, it may reach higher than 40&amp;nbsp;Â°C in searching summer. May is the hottest month of a year with an average day temperature of 42&amp;nbsp;Â°C (107.6&amp;nbsp;Â°F) in the district. Winters are short with temperatures ranging within 12&amp;nbsp;Â°C (53.6&amp;nbsp;Â°F) - 20&amp;nbsp;Â°C (68&amp;nbsp;Â°F). December is the coldest month in a year. Occasionally, due to northern cold waves temperature may fall as low as 3&amp;nbsp;Â°C (37.4&amp;nbsp;Â°F) or 4&amp;nbsp;Â°C (39.2&amp;nbsp;Â°F). Relative humidity in winter is the lowest and December is the driest month in a year with the relative humidity as low as 30%.
Rains are scarce and occur only during the [[Monsoon]] from mid June to September. Annual average rainfall is 66.6&amp;nbsp;cm (26.22&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref name=&quot;SOCIO_ECO&quot;/&gt; The average rain fall has got a drop of 9.6&amp;nbsp;cm from the averages recorded during 1900s.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMPERIAL_GAZETTEER&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Bendsura is a rapid and seasonal river. Aiming irrigation and drinking water supply to the town, a reservoir ''Bendsura Project'' (capacity 7.106&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) was constructed on the river in 1955 near the village ''PÄli'',  about 10&amp;nbsp;km south of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At some places in the town, the river is narrow and looks like a stream. The lack of vegetation and rocky and undulating terrain contributes to violent floods in heavy rains. These have repeatedly caused substantial loss of property and life in the history of the town, most recently on July 23, 1989 when a massive flooding of three habitations in the town caused a number of dead or missing and property losses of millions of rupees.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATHAPURI&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

==History==

&lt;!--[[Image:Kankaleshwar temple beed.jpg|thumb|right|''Kankaleshwar temple'' &amp;mdash; perhaps the oldest monument in the town, it has only one way to access which remains submerged in the water of its artificial lake most of the year.]] --&gt;
[[Beed]] is a historical town of possibly medieval origin, in [[Maharashtra, India]]. Few historians have mentioned it as it never became a place of importance. Rulers, almost always, ignored it perhaps because of its unimportant location.

==Historical Accounts==

The first historical mention of the town came in the ''TÄrÄ«kh-e-Firishta'' (original name ''Gulshan-e-Ibrahimi'') compiled by Muhammad Qasim [[Firishta]] (1560â1620), a 17th century Persian-Indian historian. Famous English translation of this book ''History of The Rise of Mahomedan Power in India'' by John Briggs has been published several times in India and abroad. Firishta has given little but valuable information about the town of his time. He has also mentioned the famous Kankaleshwar temple in detail. In 1317 AH (1898), Qazi Muhammad Qutbullah, a resident and Qazi of Beed wrote a detailed '''history of Beed''' town (''TÄrÄ«kh-e-BÄ«r'') in Urdu based on the accounts available at that time. Copy of this book, now can only be found in the State Archives, Library of Salar Jang [[Museum]] and Library of [[Osmania University]]; all in [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]]. However, first detailed history of the town ''RiyÄz-ul-AbrÄr'' (Garden of the Virtuous) was written by Qazi Muhammad Fakhruddin in 1152 AH (1739). Unfortunately this book is not available in the libraries for reference. However, Qutbullah has quoted this book in his ''TÄrÄ«kh-e-BÄ«r'' (History of Beed) and also has referred for the accounts. In 1361 AH (1942) Syed Basit Ali, a resident of Beed, who was a student of intermediate in the City College of Hyderabad, wrote a brief history ''TÄrÄ«kh-e-BÄ«r'' in Urdu. Its copies can be found in the library of Osmania University. In recent times Abdul HamÄ«d Nathapuri wrote ''Zila BÄ«r KÄ« TÄrÄ«kh'' (history of Beed district) in Urdu which is published in 1998 from [[Mumbai]]. His book gives accounts of mainly Beed town and is largely based on Qutbullahâs accounts and oral traditions. Some historical accounts can also be found in the gazette of Beed district published in 1969 by the Gazetteers Department of Beed district. This Gazette is now out of print but available online at the government of Maharashtra website. [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], compiled during the British rule also gives some important details of the town and the district.

==Foundation and name==

The history of the foundation of the town is unknown. According to legend, Beed was an inhabited place in the period of [[Pandavas]] and [[Kurus]] as ''Durgavati''. Its name was subsequently changed to ''Balni''. Champavati, who was sister of [[Vikramaditya]], after capturing it renamed as ''Champavatinagar''. After that the town fell to [[Calukya]] (Chalukya), Rashtrkuta and [[Yadava dynasty|Yadava]] dynasties before felling to the [[Islam in India|Muslim]] rule. However, some scholars say that it was possibly founded by the Yadava rulers of Devagiri (now Daulatabad).
''TÄrÄ«kh-e-BÄ«r'' (history of Beed) mentions that [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] named it ''Bir'' ([[Arabic]] âWellâ) after building a fort and several wells in and around the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLACE_BHIR&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recent times, wells were abundant in the town. Because of modern facilities of water supply they became less important and subsequently most of them were filled.
It is unclear that as to how the present name Beed came into use. There are at least two different traditions. The first tradition says that since the district is situated at the foot of Balaghat Range as if it is in a hole, it was named as ''Bil'' (Marathi for hole) which in course of time corrupted to ''Bid''. According to the second tradition a ''Yavana'' ruler of ancient India, named it ''Bhir'' (Persian for Water) after finding water at a very low depth &lt;ref name=&quot;PLACE_BHIR&quot;/&gt; and Bhir might have become Beed in course of time.
The first tradition seems to be untrue, because with no angle, the entire district can be called a âholeâ. Only north eastern part of the district is at lower heights and a vast area of 10,615&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² can not be called a âholeâ just because of slight depression. Furthermore, ''Bil'' (hole) in Marathi is spoken for a deep and narrow hole not for a slight depression.
The second tradition though, have some distortion, appears to be true and in accord with ''TÄrÄ«kh-e-BÄ«r'' of Quazi Muhammad Qutbullah (1898). The word âYavanaâ in early [[Indian literature]] meant a [[Greeks|Greek]] or any foreigner. At a much later date it was frequently applied to the [[Islam in India|Muslim]] invaders of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite possible that [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] may have been referred in this tradition as Yavana ruler. Muslims invaded and ruled the [[Deccan]] for centuries and almost all Muslim rulers had [[Persian language|Persian]] as their court language.  It seems that Arabic 'Bir' was eventually pronounced âBhirâ in the Indian languages and the people mistakenly took this [[Arabic]] word as Persian for the court language of the rulers was Persian. Until recent times after independence, the town was called âBirâ and âBhirâ in the official documents.

==Historical events==

[[Image:Citadel wall beed.jpg|thumb|right|Degenerating wall of ancient citadel and its Burjs &amp;mdash; An unfortunate shield for the violent floods of Bendsura for the fortunate dwellers of the town.]]

According to legend, when [[Ravana]], demon king of ''Lanka'' ([[Sri Lanka]]), abducted [[Sita]] (wife of [[Hinduism in India|Hindu]] deity [[Rama]]) and was taking her to Lanka, ''Jatayu'' (eagle) tried to stop him. Ravana cut its wings and wounded Jatayu fell on the ground. When Rama reached there in search of his beloved wife, Jatayu told him the whole story and died. The place where he died is said to be in Beed town and ''Jatashankar'' temple is standing at the place, which is; according to scholars, possibly built by [[Yadavas of Devagiri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PLACE_BHIR&quot;/&gt; Another legend also narrates that Beed was called ''Durgavati'' in the period of Pandavas and Kurus who fought a devastating war of [[Mahabharata]].

==Early history==

Early history of the town is obscure until it came under Tughluq rule. If the town was founded in Yadava era then possibly it happened in king Singhana's (1210â47) period, when [[Yadava dynasty]] reached its height. He may have built the town and Kankaleshwar temple as well. Beed came under Muslim rule for the first time in 1317 when Qutb-ud-Din Mubarak Shah (1316â20), the last [[Khilji dynasty|Khilji]], captured Devagiri and Yadava dynasty was annexed to Khilji [[dynasty]]. Beed remained under Khiljis until 1320 when Ghiyas-ud-Din Tughluq (1320â25) took over. In 1327 [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] (1325â51) made Daulatabad his capital. Tughluq and his army camped in the town in 1341 (AH 742 [[Islamic calendar]]) while on the journey back to Daulatabad from [[Warangal]]. The emperor lost one of his teeth here, which he ordered to be buried with much ceremony and a tomb was constructed at the place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tomb is still present in very poor condition near the village ''Karjani'' about 13&amp;nbsp;km south of the town. Juna Khan one of the governors of Tughluq empire is said to have resided in Beed for quite some time and introduced many reforms for the welfare of the ruled. He diverted the course of Bendsura from west to east by constructing a protection wall around the town. Before his time there was no such protection for the town and it was situated on the eastern bank of the river. After that the population was largely shifted to the western part.&lt;ref name=&quot;QUAZI&quot;/&gt;
In 1347 Beed came under Bahmanid rule when [[Hasan Gangu]] (1347â58), founder of [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmanid Sultanate]], rebelled against Tughluq rule and ascended throne of Daulatabad as Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah. [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Tughluq]] acted vigorously and came to Deccan to subdue the rebels. He recaptured the province of Daulatabad, of which, Beed was a part. Hasan Gangu and other insurgents fled to [[Bidar]] and [[Gulbarga]]. Before the matter is fully settled a rebel broke in Gujarat and the sultan approached to Gujarat appointing Imad-ul-Mulk as governor in [[Deccan]]. Meanwhile Hasan Gangu attacked Daulatabad and marched towards Beed and captured it. After that the town remained under Bahmanid rule and is said to be flourished under Firuz Shah Bahmani's (1397â1422) rule. During the reign of Humayun Shah Bahmani (1451â61), famous as ''ZÄlim'' (cruel), his brother Hasan Shah rebelled and came to Beed. A Jagirdar (feudatory) of Beed, Habibullah Shah was his supporter. Humayun Shah sent an army and after a fierce fighting in the grounds of Kankaleshwar temple, the rebellion armies defeated Humayun's army. Humayun became furious and sent another force to defeat the rebels. This time rebels were defeated, Habibullah Shah was killed and captured Hasan Shah was taken to the capital and was put before a hungry lion.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATHAPURI&quot;/&gt;

==1600 CE to 1858 CE==

After the decline of Bahmanid Sultanate the town fell to Nizam Shahi rulers of Ahmadnagar. Several wars were fought in Beed between Nizam Shahi and Adil Shahi rulers of [[Adil Shahi|Bijapur]] to take the control of Beed. In 1598 Mughals captured Beed from [[Chand Bibi]] of Ahmadnagar. A year later Nihang Khan retook it but soon it fell again to [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]]. Mughal army camped here for some time. During the reign of [[Jahangir]] (1569â1627), Jan Sipar Khan was administering Beed town. He constructed Jama Masjid of Beed in 1036 AH (1627). [[Aurangzeb]] (1658â1707), appointed Haji Sadar Shah in Beed as ''Naib-e-Subadar'' (assistant of governor). Sadar Shah did some good changes and constructions in the town. He built ''Eid Gah'' (place of Eid prayer) in 1702 and a new habitation on the heights in the eastern part as ''Ghazi Pura'' (now Islam Pura) in 1703. The remains of it are still visible.  He also constructed a small citadel (1703) inside the old large citadel which was worn out after standing for several hundred years, from Tughluq period. A stone plate in Persian script at the main entry of Jama Masjid sets the year of construction of citadel by Haji Sadar Shah in the year 1115 AH (1703). In his period economy of the town also flourished. Chhagal (water container made of leather), Gupti (hidden sword in wooden stick) etc. made in Beed were popular in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;QUAZI&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Shahinsha wali beed.jpg|thumb|right|This main entrance of ''Shahinshah Wali tomb'' was constructed by AmÄ«r NawÄz Jang in 1830.]]

Beed was quite a beautiful town during Bahmanids and Mughals. ''TÄrÄ«kh-e-BÄ«r'' mentions many gardens and amenities of these periods. Until 1960s there were two well maintained gardens in the town.
In 1724 Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah founded Asaf Jahi kingdom, seizing Deccan against the rule of Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah (1719â48). In Nizams' era no major addition or construction was done to the citadel because the old building was serving the purpose and the citadels were losing importance with the advent of modern fighting techniques.
[[Maratha]] ruler of [[Gwalior]], [[Mahadji Scindia]] (1761â94) was defeated and severely injured and was missing in the third war of [[Panipat]] in 1761. His wife, who is said to be from Beed, went to a Muslim [[Sufi]] of Beed Mansur Shah and told him to prey for the return of Mahadji. After return to Gwalior Mahadji called Mansur Shah to Gwalior but he refused and sent his son Habib Shah instead. Mahadji remained thankful to Mansur Shah for all his life. His tomb is in eastern Beed.
Reign of sixth Nizam [[Mir Mahbub Ali Khan]] (1869â1911) proved eventful in the history of Beed. Rebels, great famine and floods happened in his reign. Jagirdars were replaced by ''Awwal Taluqdars'' (Collectors) in his father's reign and Jivanji Ratanji came as the first collector of Beed in 1865. Districts were created and Beed district was formally settled in 1883.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMPERIAL_GAZETTEER&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

During the countrywide [[Indian independence movement|movement for independence]], in 19th and 20th centuries they tried to suppress the feelings of [[nationalism]] which were spreading due to nationwide efforts of the freedom fighters. [[Nationalist]]s in the state of Hyderabad did not like Nizam's friendship with the oppressor [[British Empire]].

==1858 CE to Present==
[[Image:Military_action_in_the_state_of_hyderabad_sundarlal_report.jpg|thumb|right|]]

Another rebel broke in 1858 and all the rebels were captured. After that many small incidents of defiance happened against [[British rule]] but all were suppressed by force. A major rebel broke under the leadership of Baba Sahab alias Rao Sahab in 1898. The important leaders of this movement were [[Brahmin]]s of Beed and the Brahmin officials in police and judiciary also supported the movement. They were dreaming of Brahmin rule and started collecting money for arms by looting and donations in different parts of the district. But after a short fight the rebels were captured and the movement came to an end. But the feelings of defiance could not be suppressed and different movements under the leadership of Swami Ramanand Teerth and Govind Bhai Shroff continued in Marathwada and the state. After independence, Mir Osman Ali Khan was reluctant to join the Indian Union. Finally, on September 12, 1948 a military action [[Operation Polo]] was launched and the state was easily captured within six days as Nizam's army resisted little. Although Operation Polo caused relatively few casualties, the following communal carnage was all the more terrible. Beed was one of the eight worst hit districts in the state. After calm down, a team visited the town on behalf of Indian government and sent a report to the centre. According to official, [http://www.flonnet.com/fl1805/18051140.htm Sundarlal Report], 27,000-40,000 Muslims were killed throughout the state. Horrible crimes of abduction and rape of women and girls, loot, arson, desecration of mosques, forcible conversions and seizure of houses and lands were mentioned in the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

A plebiscite was held shortly after the military action in which the population voted overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Indian Union. Many Muslims during and after 1948 migrated to [[Pakistan]]. The town has witnessed communal strife several times in modern India. In 1949 Bendsura Project was launched to provide drinking and irrigation water supply to the town and nearby villages. The project was completed in 1956. In 1952 Beed ''Nagar PÄlika'' (Municipal Council) was established under the undivided Hyderabad State. In 1962, a year after the creation of Maharashtra State, ''Beed Zila ParÄ«shad'' (District Council) came into being after dissolving all the local bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLACE_BHIR&quot;/&gt;

==Historical buildings==

===Kankaleshwar Temple===

It is perhaps the oldest and the most beautiful building in the town. Historians are not sure about the construction period of this temple. The architectural style suggests that it might have been constructed during Yadava period.,&lt;ref name=&quot;PLACE_BHIR&quot;/&gt; most probably during the reign of Singhana (1210â47), who also founded Devagiri (Daulatabad). The design of this temple has some close similarities to the temples at the famous [[caves of Ellora]]. Situated in the middle of a small lake in the eastern part of the town, the temple is built with black stone and is carved with excellent human and divine figures. A fair is held in the grounds of temple during Mahashivratri.

===Jama Masjid (Mosque)===

Built during the period of [[Mughal emperor]] Jahangir (1605â27) by his official in Beed ''JÄn SipÄr Khan'' in 1036 AH (1627), it is one of the largest mosques in Beed. Situated in the centre of the town at ''Quila'' (citadel) it has three huge domes and four minarets.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATHAPURI&quot;/&gt;

===Shahinshah Wali tomb===

[[Image:Shahinsha wali dome.jpg|thumb|right|''Shahinshah Wali tomb'' &amp;mdash; dome on the grave of Sufi Shahinshah wali.]]

Shahinshah Wali was a [[Sufi]] of 14th century. He came to Beed during the rule of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Tughluq]]. His tomb and surrounding areas were built in different periods from 1385â1840. The details can be seen in the history of Beed. It is situated on the eastern elevations. Each year an ''Urs'' (fair) is held here on 2nd day of ''Rabiâ Al-Awwal'', third month of [[Islamic calendar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NATHAPURI&quot;/&gt;

===Khandoba Temple===

It is situated on the eastern hills. Built in ''Hemadpanti'' style, it is often regarded as the symbol of town. Two symmetrical, octagonal ''dÄ«pmal'' (tower of light) rising 21.33 meters (70&amp;nbsp;ft) are standing in front of the temple. Towers have carved figures of humans and animals, now most of them defaced. There are two stories about the construction of this temple. One says that it was built by Sultanji Nimbalkar a Jagirdar of Nizam era. The other says that it was built by [[Mahadji Scindia]]. ''TÄrÄ«kh-e-BÄ«r'' (History of Beed) mentions it with Nimbalkar.&lt;ref name=&quot;QUAZI&quot;/&gt;

===Mansur Shah tomb===

Mansur Shah was 18th century Sufi of ''Suharwardy'' clan of Sufis. He is said to be a ''Dharma Guru'' (spiritual teacher) of Mahadji Scindia. His tomb is in the eastern part of Beed near Khandeshwari temple. Dome of the shrine is made of marble.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATHAPURI&quot;/&gt;

===Khazana Well===

[[Image:Khazana well beed.jpg|thumb|right|''Khazana well'' &amp;mdash; once famous and maintained, now is full of dirty water.]]

This historic and famous well is situated about 6&amp;nbsp;km south of the town. It was constructed in 991 AH (1583) by ''SalÄbat Khan'', a Jagirdar of Beed in the period of Murtaza Nizam Shah of [[Ahmadnagar]]. It is said that the water level in this well remains unchanged even in droughts.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATHAPURI&quot;/&gt; Three currents of water start from the well and irrigate the land of ''Barg o ZÄr'' (meaning 'Leaves and Flowers', pronounced in colloquial as BalguzÄr) around the town. During droughts municipality of the town take water from this well and supply it to some parts of the town and surrounding villages. SalÄbat Khan also constructed KÄranja (fountains) and a garden in the centre of the town. Tower of KÄranja is still standing in the middle of the town in a very bad condition.

===Historic Gates===

[[Image:Kotwali gate beed.JPG|thumb|right|''BÄb-uz-Zafar'' (Gate of success) &amp;mdash; now known as Kotwali Ves (Kotwali gate) was built in 1835 on the western bank of Bendsura. The gate is now in poor condition and the adjacent Fatah Burj on left is almost gone.]]

The town had several gates and a small fort in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATHAPURI&quot;/&gt; Now only four are remaining and are in poor condition. Only one out of several were built in the eastern part in Mahbub Gunj (now Hiralal Chowk). Kotwali gate (known as Kotwali Ves) is situated at the western bank of river Bendsura. This has got its name because a police station (Kotwali) was situated adjacent to the gate. Another gate, which is also in a bad condition, is found at ''Quila'' near Milliya campus. Fourth gate is in ''BashÄ«r Gunj'' area and perhaps is in a little better condition than the other gates, most probably due to the grave on its Burj which is said to be of some Sufi ''Buland Shah''.

Even this small town is an evidence of Indiaâs religious and cultural diversity. 69.15&amp;nbsp;kmÂ² of land is home for Hindu, Muslim, [[Buddhist]], [[Jain]], [[Christian]] and [[Sikh]] communities. A calculated Hindu population in the town comprises around 40% - 41%. 12,307 Hindus were living in the town in 1901, which was 69.64% of the then population.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMPERIAL_GAZETTEER&quot;/&gt; This proportion was reduced after a mass conversion of [[Dalits]] to Buddhism and [[Christianity]].

==Administration==
[[Image:Beed Municipal Council.JPG|thumb|right| New building of Municipal Council at Basheer Gunj]]

The municipal council (established in 1952) is the administrative body for the town which is directly responsible for the affairs within the town limits which is 69.15 square kilometers presently. The town has been divided into 40 Wards, each ward has its elected representative called 'Councilor'. The councilors elect the 'President' of the council which is always from the party which has majority in the council. The municipal elections are held after every five years. The district has Superintendent of police who's office is in the town. Two police stations covering eastern and western parts of the town are operational under the superintendent of police.

==Culture==
[[Image:Tahari.jpg|thumb|right|''Tahari'' &amp;mdash; one of the most common non-vegetarian dish.]]
Culture, though not typical, is predominantly Maharashtrian. Customs are followed religiously in marriages and other functions. Family, customs and religion still holds importance in the society. Food is largely vegetarian, but spicy non-vegetarian food is also popular. Several restaurants, Dhabas and roadside food shops offer non-vegetarian food. Chicken is perhaps the most popular non-vegetarian food in all sects of society. ''AchÄr'' (pickle), ''pÄpad'' (poppadom) and spices are part of a common high chilli diet.

New generation; especially males, wear western outfits. ''Shalwar Khamis'' is popular in young girls. Married women wear ''Saris'' (a long piece of colourful fabric) and bodice. Traditional outfits are popular, if any, only in elderly. [[Diwali]], [[Holi]], Dasehra, [[Eid-ul-Fitr]], [[Eid-ul-Adha]] and Buddha Jayanti are major festivals. New housing constructions are mainly concrete based, but in poor, mud-and-mortar houses with metal sheet roofs are common.
There are no amenities in the town except cinema halls and a small, little maintained garden. Few years back there were seven cinema halls, now four are remaining; of which âAshokaâ is the oldest. Two parks were maintained until 1969 by the municipal council.&lt;ref name=&quot;PLACE_BHIR&quot;/&gt; One small but well maintained garden including a small zoo was situated at the eastern bank of Bendsura. A massive flood on July 23, 1989 wiped it off leaving no traces. A small garden cum zoo is recently been constructed in ''Khas Bagh'' area but it needs much improvements.

==Transport==
The town is accessible only by road. National Highway 211, linking [[Dhulia]] to [[Solapur]] passes through the town. Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) a state owned transport company provides bus access to the major towns in Maharashtra and neighbouring states. Some private travel agencies also have services to the major cities of the state. Nearest domestic airport is [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] (133&amp;nbsp;km); nearest international airports are [[Mumbai]] (418&amp;nbsp;km), [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]] (428&amp;nbsp;km) and [[Pune]] (250&amp;nbsp;km). Nearest railway stations are [[Jalna (city)|Jalna]] (110&amp;nbsp;km), [[Parli]] (120&amp;nbsp;km), Aurangabad (133&amp;nbsp;km) and [[Ahmadnagar]] (145&amp;nbsp;km). Auto rickshaw is the only mode of public transport inside town. Roads inside the town are of average width and below average quality. Railway line access is probably the most awaited thing for the people of town.

==Economy==
Beed has a backward economy with a negligible growth. In 1997 Sarma committee has listed Beed as one of the 100 most backward districts in [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;POOR&quot;/&gt; After this listing the government of India and the government of Maharashtra specified Beed town as 'D' zone and declared tax holiday and concessions to lure the investors in the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without proper arrangement of water supply and transport facility, this declaration resulted nothing. Economic backwardness is attributed to the lack of natural resources, frequent droughts, lack of good transport facilities and corruption.&lt;ref name=&quot;PROFILE&quot;/&gt; Economy entirely depends on monsoon dependent agriculture, service sector and small businesses. Beed is one of the poorest districts of Maharashtra with Per capita [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of [[Rupee|Rs]] 15,303 (about $380) which is lower than the [[Maharashtra]] State average GDP [[Rupee|Rs]] 17,079 (about $427).&lt;ref name=&quot;PROFILE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HDI&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elections have been fought with the issue of [[railway]] line facility. In the recent times the list of issues has gone up with shortage of drinking water supply and electricity, frequent droughts, failing crops and suicide of farmers, unemployment, corruption and increasing crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;PROFILE&quot;/&gt; Beed also records highest power theft in Maharashtra. Nearly 60% power supplied to the district is stolen before it can reach to the consumers who pay for it. Further, unpaid electricity bills runs to almost [[Rupee]]s 4540 million (about $113 M) .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.ndtv.com/morenews/showmorestory.asp?category=National&amp;id=101803| title = Beed Records Highest Power Theft| work = Ramachandran, Anupama | publisher = NDTV.com | date = 2006-03-06| accessdate = 2006-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social and environmental issues are no different than that of the whole country. [[Human rights]] (especially womenâs and childrenâs), child labor, poverty, rising [[HIV]] infections, religious strife, human trafficking and sexual abuse are some major social issues of concern in Beed. [[Sex Ratio]] in the town is also on decline as is the case of the whole country due to foeticide of female babies.
