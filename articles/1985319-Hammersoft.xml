The '''HaydarpaÅa Terminal''' or '''HaydarpaÅa Station''' ({{lang-tr|HaydarpaÅa GarÄ±}}) is a major intercity [[rail station]] and transportation hub in [[KadÄ±kÃ¶y]], [[Ä°stanbul]]. It is the busiest rail terminal in [[Turkey]] and the [[Middle East]] and one of the busiest in [[Eastern Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=231 TCDD Official Site] - HaydarpaÅa commuter train timetables&lt;/ref&gt;. The terminal also has connections to [[Ä°ETT]] bus and ferry service. The Moda Tramway is a few blocks south of the station. The station has a main building (opened in 1909) that houses the headquarters of [[TCDD District 1|District 1]].

HaydarpaÅa Terminal is the western terminus of the [[Istanbul-Ankara Main Line]] and was the western terminus of the former [[Baghdad Railway]] (Ä°stanbul-Konya-Adana-Aleppo-Baghdad) and the [[Hejaz Railway]] (Ä°stanbul-Konya-Adana-Aleppo-Damascus-Amman-Medina)&lt;ref name=&quot;HaydarpaÅa&quot;&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/Stations/IstanbulHaydarpasa HaydarpaÅa Station History] - Trains and Railways of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;. The tracks do not cross the [[Bosphorus]], but there is a [[train ferry]], that carries rail cars from HaydarpaÅa, on the [[Asia]]n side, to [[Istanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci]], on the [[Europe]]an side&lt;ref name=&quot;HaydarpaÅa&quot;/&gt;.

==History==
===Ottoman Era (1872â1922)===
[[Ä°stanbul]] was a very important city. At the time, it was the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as well as the largest city in the empire. Ä°stanbul was a major economic and cultural hub. Ä°stanbul had no rail link, so in 1871 [[Sultan]] [[AbdÃ¼laziz]] ordered a rail line to be built from [[HaydarpaÅa]] to [[Ä°zmit]]&lt;ref name=CFOA&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/History/CFOA CFOA History] - Trains and Railways of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;. HaydarpaÅa station opened in 1872, when the railway reached [[Gebze]]. In 1888 the [[Anatolian Railway]] (CFOA) took over the line and the station. Since the station was built next to the Bosphorus, freight trains would unload at HaydarpaÅa and the freight would be transferred to [[ships]]. HaydarpaÅa station saw its first regular passenger service in 1890: a daily train from HaydarpaÅa to Ä°zmit&lt;ref name=&quot;CFOA&quot;/&gt;. In 1892 the CFOA built a line to [[Ankara]] and shortly after a daily train ran between the two cities. HaydarpaÅa was chosen to be the northern terminus of the [[Baghdad Railway]] and the [[Hedjaz Railway]] in 1904 and with rail traffic increasing, a new and larger station was required. The Anatolian Railway hired two German architects; Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu to build the new building. They chose a [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] structure and construction started in 1906. Its foundation is based on 1100 wooden piles, each 21 meters long, driven into the mushy shore by a steam hammer. German and [[Italy|Italian]] [[stonemason]]s crafted the facade embellishments of the terminal. The German engineers and craftsmen who worked at the construction site of the building established a small [[Bosporus Germans|German neighbourhood]] in the YeldeÄirmeni quarter of [[KadÄ±kÃ¶y]]. The new pseudo-castle station was completed in on August 19, 1909. The new station was inaugurated on November 4, 1909 for the anniversary of [[Mehmed V]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CFOA&quot;/&gt;. The new station was built on land reclaimed from the sea. [[World War I]] broke out in 1914 and the [[Ottoman Empire]] sided with the [[Central Powers]] against the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]]. The Ottomans lost and Ä°stanbul was taken over by the [[British Empire]]. With the outbreak of the [[Turkish Independence War]] in 1919, British troops would board trains at HaydarpaÅa to the frontier.

===Turkish Era (1923âPresent)===
[[Image:Haydarpasa-1070032 1070097a.jpg|right|350px|thumb|HaydarpaÅa terminal]]

The [[Turkish Independence War]] ended October 29, 1923. The [[Republic of Turkey]] was formed and the [[British Empire]] retreated from Ä°stanbul. HaydarpaÅa station was still under CFOA control but in 1927, the newly formed [[Turkish State Railways]] took over the CFOA and the station, in an attempt to nationalize all Turkish railways&lt;ref name=TCDD&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/History/TCDD TCDD History] - Trains and Railways of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1927 the [[CIWL]] started a premier train service from HaydarpaÅa to Ankara: the [[Anatolian Express]]. This all-sleeper train traveled daily between the two cities. In 1938 the [[Eastern Express]] entered service from HaydarpaÅa to the eastern Turkish city of [[Kars]], a distance of {{convert|1994|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Steam and Rail - By Colin Garrat and Max Wade-Matthews, page 401&lt;/ref&gt;. With the completion of the Baghdad Railway to Baghdad, the famous [[Taurus Express]] entered service in 1940 from HaydarpaÅa to [[Baghdad]], a distance of {{convert|2566|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Steam and Rail - By Colin Garrat and Max Wade-Matthews, page 396&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1965 the [[Trans-Asia Express]] entered service from HaydarpaÅa to [[Tehran]], a distance of {{convert|3059|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref&gt;The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Steam and Rail - By Colin Garrat and Max Wade-Matthews, page 403&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1969, the tracks from HaydarpaÅa to [[Gebze]] were electrified with [[25 kV AC]] [[overhead lines|catenary]] for the [[HaydarpaÅa-Gebze Commuter Line]]&lt;ref name=&quot;TCDD&quot;/&gt;. In 1979 a tanker burning on the Bosphorus damaged the station building, but was restored a few months later. On November 28, 2010 a fire caused by carelessness during restoration process, destroyed the roof and the 4th floor of the station building.&lt;ref name=hÃ¼r&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/16397845.asp?gid=373]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Haydarpasa campus general.jpg|thumb|350px|The nearby HaydarpaÅa Campus of the [[Marmara University]], originally built as the Imperial Medical School and designed by [[Alexander Vallaury]] and [[Raimondo D'Aronco]].]]

There are tombs and monuments in the [[HaydarpaÅa Cemetery]] near the military hospital, dedicated to the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Commonwealth]] soldiers, who lost their lives during the [[Crimean War]] (1854â1856) and during the two World Wars ([[World War I|1914-1918]] and [[World War II|1939-1945]], respectively.)

The northwest wing of the 19th century [[Selimiye Barracks]], which was transformed into a military hospital during the Crimean War, was the place where nursing pioneer [[Florence Nightingale]] cared wounded and infected [[British people|British]] soldiers. Her room is today a museum, and her belongings are exhibited to honor her memory. The museum also contains other items which date from the Crimean War.

The buildings of the HaydarpaÅa Numune Hospital, GATA Military Hospital, Dr. Siyami Ersek Hospital and the present-day HaydarpaÅa Campus of the [[Marmara University]] (the former HaydarpaÅa High School, which was originally built as the ''Mekteb-i TÄ±bbiye-i Åahane'' (Imperial Medical School) and designed by architects [[Alexander Vallaury]] and [[Raimondo D'Aronco]]) are located close to the station.

The [[Port of HaydarpaÅa]] at the north is one of the main [[container terminal]]s of Turkey.
