[[File:Dc_five_1.svg|thumb|right|150px|Example of U.S. DEFCON display]]
A '''defense readiness condition''' ('''DEFCON''') is an alert posture used by the [[United States Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JP1-02&quot;&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf Joint Publication 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, 12 April 2001 (as amended through 19 August 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;   The DEFCON system was developed by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and [[Unified Combatant Command|unified and specified combatant commands]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sagan&quot;&gt;Sagan, S. D. (1985). [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2538543 Nuclear Alerts and Crisis Management]. ''[[International Security]]'', 9 (5), 99-139&lt;/ref&gt;   It prescribes five graduated levels of readiness (or states of alert) for the U.S. military, and increase in severity from DEFCON 5 (least severe) to DEFCON 1 (most severe) to match varying military situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;JP1-02&quot;/&gt;

DEFCONs are a subsystem of a series of [[LERTCON|Alert Conditions]], or LERTCONs, that also includes [[EMERGCON|Emergency Conditions]] (EMERGCONs).&lt;ref name=&quot;cesas&quot;&gt;[http://www.sas.usace.army.mil/em/CESAS500112.pdf United States Army Corps of Engineers Savannah District (CESAS) Plan 500-1-12, 1 August 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  DEFCONs should not be confused with similar systems used by the U.S. military, such as [[Force Protection Condition]]s (FPCONS), [[REDCON|Readiness Conditions]] (REDCONS), and [[WATCHCON|Watch Conditions]] (WATCHCONS), or the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] used by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]].

==Levels==
The preparations that take place under the five DEFCONs are difficult to describe because they vary between many commands, they have changed over time as new weapon systems were deployed, and the precise details remain [[Classified information in the United States|classified]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sagan&quot;/&gt;   Additionally, during nuclear / normal tests, exercises, or drills, the [[United States Department of Defense]] uses exercise terms when referring to the DEFCONs.&lt;ref name=&quot;eap-jcs&quot;&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/reading_room/322.pdf FOIA Release of &quot;Emergency Action Procedures of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Volume I â General&quot; (April 24, 1981)]&lt;/ref&gt;   This is to preclude the possibility of confusing exercise commands with actual operational commands.  The current exercise terms have been used since at least 1960, when they were used in a [[North American Aerospace Defense Command]] (NORAD) exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;sagan&quot;/&gt;

The five DEFCONs, their exercise terms, and their general descriptions are shown below.&lt;ref name=&quot;sagan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cesas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;eap-jcs&quot;/&gt;

Movies and popular culture often misuse the DEFCON system by &quot;going to DEFCON 5&quot; during a state of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefconFive Defcon Five] at [http://www.tvtropes.org/ TV Tropes]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, DEFCON 5 is the lowest state of readiness.DEFCON 1 has never been called for.

==History==
In November 1959, the Joint Chiefs of Staff created the DEFCON system so that a uniform readiness posture could be prescribed in the various [[Unified Combatant Command|military commands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/stable/2538543 Sagan, S. D. (1985). Nuclear Alerts and Crisis Management. ''International Security'', 9 (4), 99-139.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the system was introduced, portions of the U.S. military have been placed at higher readiness levels on numerous instances. 

===Cold War===
[[File:Dc_two_1.svg|thumb|right|150px|The highest level of DEFCON known to have been used]]
The highest confirmed DEFCON ever was Level 2. During the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] on October 22, 1962, the U.S. armed forces were ordered to DEFCON 3. On October 23, [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) was ordered to DEFCON 2, while the rest of the U.S. armed forces remained at DEFCON 3. SAC remained at DEFCON 2 until November 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;fas-defcon&quot;&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/defcon.htm DEFCON DEFense CONdition - United States Nuclear Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next DEFCON Level 2 was during a Soviet missile test in the Pacific in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-12/news/mn-214_1_test-flights]&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the Cold War, U.S. [[ICBM]] sites were at DEFCON 4, rather than 5.

===Yom Kippur War===
The U.S. armed forces were technically at DEFCON 3 status during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fas-defcon&quot;/&gt;

===September 11, 2001 attacks===
The third time the United States reached DEFCON 3 was during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] ordered the increased DEFCON level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.911commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf 911 Commission Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The DEFCON level is controlled primarily by the [[President of the United States|President]] and the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], through the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and the [[Combatant Commander]]s, and each DEFCON level defines specific security, activation and response scenarios for the troops in question.

Different branches of the U.S. armed forces (like the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]) and different bases or command groups can be activated at different defense conditions.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Dc_one_1.svg|thumb|right|150px|DEFCON 1]]
* DEFCON was used in the 1983 film, ''[[WarGames]]'' and the 1996 films, ''[[Independence_Day_(film)|Independence Day]]'', ''[[Crimson_Tide_(film)|Crimson Tide]]'', and ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]''.
* In the first person shooter game ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', as the player progresses through the game, the DEFCON level is growing and eventually reaches DEFCON 1 while the player is playing the last mission of the game.
* The real-time strategy game ''[[DEFCON (video game)|DEFCON]]'' simulates the outbreak of thermonuclear war, and advances through the DEFCON levels as each match progresses.
* In the movie ''[[Watchmen_film|watchmen]]'' president Nixon orders a state of DEFCON 1
