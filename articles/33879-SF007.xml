Windows XP, the successor to [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows Me]], was the first consumer-oriented operating system produced by Microsoft to be built on the [[Windows NT kernel]]. Windows XP was released worldwide for retail sale on October 25, 2001, and over 400 million copies were in use in January 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;idc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itworld.com/Comp/4063/060118xpsp3/pfindex.html|title=Analyst: No effect from tardy XP service pack|author=Jeremy Kirk|work=ITworld.com|date=January 18, 2006|accessdate=October 5, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070317204906/http://www.itworld.com/Comp/4063/060118xpsp3/pfindex.html|archivedate=March 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was succeeded by [[Windows Vista]] in January 2007.  Direct [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] and retail sales of Windows XP ceased on June 30, 2008.  Microsoft continued to sell Windows XP through their System Builders (smaller OEMs who sell assembled computers) program until January 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crn.com/article/printableArticle.jhtml?articleId=199001306 System Builders Can Buy Windows XP Until January '09].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oem.microsoft.com/script/contentPage.aspx?pageid=564778 {{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Windows NT|NT]]-based versions of Windows, which are programmed in [[C Programming Language|C]], [[C++]], and [[Assembly language|assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/winntas/training/ntarchitectoview/ntarc_2.mspx |title=Microsoft Windows System Overview |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; are known for their improved stability and efficiency over the [[Windows 9x|9x]] versions of [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://review.zdnet.com/4520-6033_16-4206552.html|title=The 10 top things you MUST know about Win XP|author=David Coursey|publisher=[[CNET Networks|CNet.com]]|date=October 25, 2001|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helpdesk.princeton.edu/kb/display.plx?ID=9672|title=A Brief History and Introduction to Windows|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|date=July 22, 2004|accessdate=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows XP presented a significantly redesigned [[graphical user interface]], a change Microsoft promoted as more user-friendly than previous versions of Windows. A new software management facility called [[Side-by-Side Assembly]] was introduced to ameliorate the &quot;[[DLL hell]]&quot; that plagues 9x versions of Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973843.aspx|title=Simplifying Deployment and Solving DLL Hell with the .NET Framework|work=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=Microsoft|month=November | year=2001|accessdate=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997620.aspx|title=How To Build and Service Isolated Applications and Side-by-Side Assemblies for Windows XP|work=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=Microsoft|date=August 24, 2001|accessdate=July 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first version of Windows to use [[Microsoft Product Activation|product activation]] to combat [[Copyright infringement of software|illegal copying]].

According to [[web analytics]] data generated by [[W3Schools]], from September 2003 to July 2011, Windows XP was the most widely used operating system for accessing the internet. {{As of|2011|10}}, Windows XP market share is at 33.4%&lt;!-- When updating the market share, please be sure to update the &quot;accessdate&quot; field in the citation --&gt; after having peaked at 76.1% in January 2007.&lt;ref name=marketshare&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp|title=OS Platform Statistics|publisher=w3schools|accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User interface==
Windows XP featured a new task-based GUI (Graphical user interface). The Start menu and Taskbar were updated and many visual effects were added, including:
*A translucent blue selection rectangle in Windows Explorer
*[[Drop shadow]]s for icon labels on the desktop
*Task-based sidebars in Explorer windows (&quot;common tasks&quot;)
*The ability to group the taskbar buttons of the windows of one application into one button
*The ability to lock the taskbar and other toolbars to prevent accidental changes
*The highlighting of recently added programs on the Start menu
*Shadows under menus (Windows 2000 had shadows under mouse pointers, but not menus)

Windows XP analyzes the performance impact of visual effects and uses this to determine whether to enable them, so as to prevent the new functionality from consuming excessive additional processing overhead. Users can further customize these settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinXPVisualFX&quot;&gt;{{cite news
|url = http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/display_change_visual_effects.mspx
|publisher = Microsoft
|title = Change Windows visual effects
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some effects, such as [[alpha compositing]] (transparency and fading), are handled entirely by many newer video cards. However, if the video card is not capable of hardware alpha blending, performance can be substantially degraded, and Microsoft recommends the feature should be turned off manually.&lt;ref name=&quot;XPFXMSKB&quot;&gt;{{cite news

|date = January 15, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows XP added the ability for Windows to use &quot;Visual Styles&quot; to change the appearance of the user interface. However, visual styles must be cryptographically signed by Microsoft to run. [[Luna (theme)|''Luna'']] is the name of the new visual style that ships with Windows XP, and is enabled by default for machines with more than 64 [[MiB]] of [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. ''Luna'' refers only to one particular visual style, not to all of the new user interface features of Windows XP as a whole. Some users &quot;patch&quot; the &lt;tt&gt;uxtheme.dll&lt;/tt&gt; file that restricts the ability to use visual styles, created by the general public or the user, on Windows XP.&lt;ref name=&quot;XPUXTHEME&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In addition to the included Windows XP themes, there is one previously unreleased theme with a dark blue taskbar and window bars similar to Windows Vista titled &quot;[[Energy Blue#Royale Noir / Zune theme|Royale Noir]]&quot; available as unofficial download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istartedsomething.com/20061029/royale-noir/|title=Royale Noir: secret XP theme uncovered|publisher=istartedsomething.com|date=October 29, 2006|accessdate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft officially released a modified version of this theme as the &quot;[[Energy Blue#Royale Noir / Zune theme|Zune]]&quot; theme, to celebrate the launch of its Zune portable media player in November 2006. The differences are only visual with a new glassy look along with a black taskbar instead of dark blue and an orange start button instead of green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/a/9/ea9af5ae-b48e-473e-85fe-dcde7472e644/ZuneDesktopTheme.msi| title = Zune Desktop Theme| publisher = Microsoft Corporation| date = March 11, 2006| accessdate =August 8, 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/1312941924177167| archivedate = August 10, 2011|&lt;!--DashBotWC--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the Media Center &quot;[[Energy Blue]]&quot; theme, which was included in the Media Center editions, is also available to download for use on all Windows XP editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royale Theme for WinXP - Official |work=Windows downloads |publisher=[[Softpedia]] |date=May 11, 2006|url=http://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Themes/Royale-Theme-for-WinXP.shtml |accessdate=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The default wallpaper, [[Bliss (image)|Bliss]], is a [[Windows bitmap|BMP]] photograph of a landscape in the [[Napa County, California|Napa Valley]] outside [[Napa, California]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bliss1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=No view of Palouse from Windows |first=Paul |last=Turner |url=http://spokesmanreview.com/pf.asp?date=022204&amp;ID=s1490284 |newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |location=Spokane |date=February 22, 2004 |accessdate=November 16, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lKhQRgaA |archivedate=November 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with rolling green hills and a blue sky with [[stratocumulus cloud|stratocumulus]] and [[cirrus cloud]]s.

The Windows 2000 &quot;classic&quot; interface can be used instead if preferred. Several third party utilities exist that provide hundreds of different visual styles.

Users in British schools observed the improved ease of use and advanced capabilities{{ndash}}comparing the former to {{nowraplinks|[[RISC OS]]}} and {{nowraplinks|[[Mac OS]]}}, and the latter to [[Unix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jack | last = Schofield | authorlink = Jack Schofield | title = A very good job...? | date = November 13, 2001 | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/nov/13/itforschools.schools2 | work = The Guardian | accessdate =June 30, 2011 | quote = The consensus feeling seems to be that XP provides the ease of use of Acorn and Apple systems, plus the solidity and advanced capabilities of Unix, while retaining most of the compatibility of Windows 95/98 and Me.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
{{Main|Windows XP editions}}
[[Image:XP-Editions.svg|thumb|280px|Diagram representing the main editions of Windows XP. It is based on the category of the edition (grey) and codebase (black arrow).]]
The two major editions are Windows XP Home Edition, designed for home users, and Windows XP Professional, designed for business and power-users. XP Professional contains advanced features that the average home user would not use. However, these features are not necessarily missing from XP Home. They are simply disabled, but are there and ''can'' become functional. These releases were made available at retail outlets that sell computer software, and were preinstalled on computers sold by major computer manufacturers.  As of mid-2008, both editions continue to be sold.  A third edition, called Windows XP Media Center Edition, was introduced in 2002 and was updated every year until 2006 to incorporate new digital media, broadcast television and [[Media Center Extender]] capabilities.  Unlike the Home and Professional edition, it was never made available for retail purchase, and was typically either sold through [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] channels, or was preinstalled on computers that were typically marketed as &quot;media center PCs&quot;.

Two different [[64-bit]] editions were made available.  One, designed specifically for Itanium-based workstations, was introduced in 2001 at around the same time as the Home and Professional editions, but was discontinued a few years later when vendors of Itanium hardware stopped selling workstation-class machines due to low sales.  The other, called Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, supports the x86-64 extension. x86-64 was implemented first by AMD as &quot;AMD64&quot;, found in AMD's [[Opteron]] and [[Athlon 64]] chips, and later implemented by Intel as &quot;[[Intel 64]]&quot; (formerly known as IA-32e and EM64T), found in some of Intel's [[Pentium 4]] and later chips.

Windows XP Tablet PC Edition was produced for a class of specially designed notebook/laptop computers called [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]]s. It is compatible with a pen-sensitive screen, supporting handwritten notes and portrait-oriented screens.
[[Image:TabletPC 2004.png|thumb|Internet Explorer 6 running in Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]]

Microsoft also released [[Windows XP Embedded]], an edition for specific consumer electronics, [[set-top box]]es, kiosks/[[Automatic teller machine|ATMs]], medical devices, arcade video games, point-of-sale terminals, and Voice over Internet Protocol ([[Voice over IP|VoIP]]) components.  In July 2006, Microsoft released [[Windows Fundamentals for Legacy PCs]], a [[thin client]] version of Windows XP Embedded which targets older machines (as early as the original Pentium). It is only available to [[Microsoft Software Assurance|Software Assurance]] customers. It is intended for corporate customers who would like to upgrade to Windows XP to take advantage of its security and management capabilities, but can't afford to purchase new hardware.

===Editions for specific markets===
[[Windows XP Starter Edition]] is a lower-cost edition of Windows XP available in Thailand, Indonesia, Russia, India, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Uruguay and Venezuela. It is similar to Windows XP Home, but is limited to low-end hardware, can only run three programs at a time, and has some other features either removed or disabled by default.  Each country's edition is also customized for that country, including desktop backgrounds of popular locations, [[software localization|localized]] help features for those who may not speak English, and other default settings designed for easier use than typical Windows XP installations.  The Malaysian version, for example, contains a desktop background of the [[Kuala Lumpur]] skyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2004, the [[European Commission]] fined Microsoft â¬497 million (US$603 million) and ordered the company to provide a version of Windows without [[Windows Media Player]]. The Commission concluded that Microsoft &quot;broke [[European Union]] competition law by leveraging its near [[monopoly]] in the market for PC operating systems onto the markets for work group [[Server (computing)|server]] operating systems and for media players&quot;. After unsuccessful appeals in 2004 and 2005, Microsoft reached an agreement with the Commission where it would release a court-compliant version, Windows XP ''Edition N''. This version does not include the company's Windows Media Player but instead encourages users to pick and download their own media player. Microsoft wanted to call this version ''Reduced Media Edition'', but EU regulators objected and suggested the ''Edition N'' name, with the ''N'' signifying &quot;not with Media Player&quot; for both Home and Professional editions of Windows XP. Because it is sold at the same price as the version with Windows Media Player included, [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Lenovo]] and [[Fujitsu Siemens Computers|Fujitsu Siemens]] have chosen not to stock the product. However, Dell did offer the operating system for a short time. Consumer interest has been low, with roughly 1,500 units shipped to [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEMs]], and no reported sales to consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinXPlite&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In December 2005, the [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Korean Fair Trade Commission]] ordered Microsoft to make available editions of Windows XP and [[Windows Server 2003]] that do not contain [[Windows Media Player]] or [[Windows Messenger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the European Commission decision, this decision was based on the grounds that Microsoft had abused its dominant position in the market to push other products onto consumers.  Unlike that decision, however, Microsoft was also forced to withdraw the non-compliant versions of Windows from the South Korean market.  This decision resulted in Microsoft's releasing &quot;K&quot; and &quot;KN&quot; variants of the Home and Professional editions in August 2006.

That same year, Microsoft also released two additional editions of Windows XP Home Edition directed towards subscription-based and pay-as-you-go pricing models.  These editions, released as part of Microsoft's [[Microsoft FlexGo|FlexGo]] initiative, are used in conjunction with a hardware component to enforce time limitations on the usage of Windows.  Its target market is emerging economies such as Brazil and Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

===Languages===
Windows XP was available in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/292246|title=List of languages supported in Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=December 3, 2007|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Multilingual User Interface|MUI]] packs and [[Language Interface Pack]]s translating the user interface were also available for certain languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/2/e/62e61f10-e106-4f4c-a862-63eec2b41efb/readme.htm|title=Cumulative Help Update for Microsoft Windows XP Multilingual User Interface (MUI) Pack (KB841625)|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/industry/publicsector/government/locallanguage/find-a-language.aspx?regid=_all_|title=Unlimited Potential: Local Language Program|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ATMs and Vendors===
[[Automated teller machine]] (ATM) vendors [[Wincor Nixdorf]], [[NCR Corporation]] and [[Diebold|Diebold Incorporated]] have all adopted Microsoft Windows XP as their migration path from [[OS/2]]. Wincor Nixdorf, who has been pushing for standardization for many years, began shipping ATMs with Windows when they first arrived on the scene.

Diebold initially shipped XP Home Edition exclusively, but, following extensive pressure from customer banks to support a common operating system, switched to support XP Professional to match their primary competitor, NCR Corporation and Wincor Nixdorf.

==Service packs==
Microsoft occasionally releases [[service pack]]s for its Windows operating systems to fix problems and add features. Each service pack is a superset of all previous service packs and patches so that only the latest service pack needs to be installed, and also includes new revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2/overview.mspx | title=Windows XP Service Pack 2 Overview | publisher=[[Microsoft]] | date=August 4, 2004 | accessdate=October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However if you still have the earliest version of Windows XP on Retail CD (without any service packs included), you will need to install SP1a or SP2, before SP3 can be installed.
Older service packs need not be manually removed before application of the most recent one. Windows Update &quot;normally&quot; takes care of automatically removing unnecessary files.

Windows XP was criticized by some users for security vulnerabilities, tight integration of applications such as [[Internet Explorer 6]] and [[Windows Media Player]], and for aspects of its default user interface.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[#Service Pack 2|Service Pack 2]], [[#Service Pack 3|Service Pack 3]], and [[Internet Explorer 8]] addressed some of these concerns.

The service pack details below only apply to the 32-bit editions. Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was based on [[Windows Server 2003]] Service Pack 1 and claimed to be &quot;SP1&quot; in system properties from the initial release. It is updated by the same service packs and hotfixes as the x64 edition of Windows Server 2003.&lt;!--fixme: add info on Itanium edition--&gt;

===Service Pack 1===
[[Image:Windows XP - Program Access and Defaults.png|thumbnail|right|''Set Program Access and Defaults'' was added in Service Pack 1.]] Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9, 2002.  It contains post-[[Release to manufacture|RTM]] security fixes and hot-fixes, compatibility updates, optional [[.NET Framework]] support, enabling technologies for new devices such as Tablet PCs, and a new [[Windows Messenger|Windows Messenger 4.7 version]].  The most notable new features were [[Universal Serial Bus|USB 2.0]] support and a ''Set Program Access and Defaults'' utility that aimed at hiding various middleware products.  Users can control the default application for activities such as web browsing and instant messaging, as well as hide access to some of Microsoft's bundled programs.  This utility was first brought into the older Windows 2000 operating system with its Service Pack 3.  This Service Pack supported [[SATA]] and [[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] that were larger than 137GB (48-bit [[Logical block addressing|LBA]] support) by default. The [[Microsoft Java Virtual Machine]], which was not in the RTM version, appeared in this Service Pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title      = Windows XP Service Pack 1 preview
| date       = September 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for IPv6 was also introduced in this Service Pack.

On February 3, 2003, Microsoft released Service Pack 1a (SP1a). This release removed Microsoft's [[Java virtual machine]] as a result of a lawsuit with [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Service Pack 2===
[[Image:Windows Security Center XP SP2.png|thumb|right|[[Windows Security Center]] was added in Service Pack 2.]]
Service Pack 2 (SP2) was released on August 25, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389|accessdate=September 21, 2007|title=How to obtain the latest Windows XP service pack|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20041014021822/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389|archivedate=March 13, 2011|date=March 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on security. Unlike the previous service pack, SP2 added new functionality to Windows XP,  such as [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] encryption compatibility and improved [[Wi-Fi]] support (with a wizard utility), a [[pop-up ad]] blocker for [[Internet Explorer 6]], and [[Bluetooth]] support. The new welcome screen during the kernel boot removes the subtitles &quot;Professional&quot;, &quot;Home Edition&quot; and &quot;Embedded&quot; since Microsoft introduced new Windows XP editions prior to the release of SP2. The green loading bar in Home Edition and the yellow one in Embedded were replaced with the blue bar, seen in Professional and other versions of Windows XP, making the boot-screen of operating systems resemble each other. Colors in other areas, such as Control Panel and the Help and Support tool, remained as before.

Service Pack 2 also added new security enhancements (codenamed &quot;Springboard&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/news2/windows-xp-sp2-to-be-springboard-to-longhorn.aspx |url=Windows XP SP2 to be 'Springboard' to Longhorn |journal=[[Windows IT Pro]] |first=Paul |last=Thurrott |authorlink=Paul Thurrott |date=October 15, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included a major revision to the included firewall that was renamed to [[Windows Firewall]] and became enabled by default, [[Data Execution Prevention]], which can be weakly emulated,{{Clarify|October 2009|date=October 2009}} gains hardware support in the [[NX bit]] that can stop some forms of buffer overflow attacks.  Also [[raw socket]] support is removed (which supposedly limits the damage done by [[Zombie computer|zombie machines]]).  Additionally, security-related improvements were made to e-mail and web browsing.  Windows XP Service Pack 2 includes the Windows Security Center, which provides a general overview of security on the system, including the state of [[antivirus software]], Windows Update, and the new Windows Firewall. Third-party anti-virus and firewall applications can interface with the new Security Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Service Pack 2b====

In August 2006, Microsoft released updated installation media for Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1 to contain a patch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Service Pack 2c====

On August 10, 2007, Microsoft announced a minor update to Service Pack 2, called Service Pack 2c (SP2c).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This update was only available to system builders from their distributors in Windows XP Professional and Windows XP Professional N operating systems.  SP2c was released in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) was [[release to manufacturing|released to manufacturing]] on April 21, 2008, and to the public via both the Microsoft Download Center and [[Windows Update]] on May 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/itproxpsp/thread/9ababbbc-d3ed-41c4-8b6c-9d194c121604|title= Windows XP Service Pack 3 Released to Manufacturing|publisher=Microsoft|date=April 21, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sp3rtw&gt;{{cite web |url=http://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/itproxpsp/thread/34234455-65a4-4069-a034-435e95b17f84|title=Windows XP SP3 Released to Web (RTW), now available on Windows Update and Microsoft Download Center|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=May 6, 2008|accessdate=January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msdnsp3&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5b33b5a8-5e76-401f-be08-1e1555d4f3d4&amp;DisplayLang=en |title=Windows XP Service Pack 3 Network Installation Package for IT Professionals and Developers |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=May 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2fcde6ce-b5fb-4488-8c50-fe22559d164e&amp;DisplayLang=en |title=Windows XP Service Pack 3 - ISO-9660 CD Image File |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=May 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New features in Service Pack 3====
* NX APIs for application developers to enable [[Data Execution Prevention]] for their code, independent of system-wide compatibility enforcement settings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michael_howard/archive/2008/01/29/new-nx-apis-added-to-windows-vista-sp1-windows-xp-sp3-and-windows-server-2008.aspx |title=New NX APIs added to Windows Vista SP1, Windows XP SP3 and Windows Server 2008 |work=Michael Howard's Web Log |agency=[[MSDN Blogs]] |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support for [[SHA-2]] signatures in [[X.509]] certificates &lt;ref name=&quot;SP3Overview&quot;/&gt;
* [[Network Access Protection]] client
* [[Group Policy]] support for IEEE [[802.1X]] authentication for [[Network interface controller|wired network adapters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://207.46.16.252/en-us/magazine/2008.02.cableguy.aspx IEEE 802.1X Wired Authentication: The Cable Guy].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Credentials [[Security Support Provider Interface|Security Service Provider]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951608 Description of the Credential Security Service Provider (CredSSP) in Windows XP Service Pack 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Descriptive ''Security options'' in [[Group Policy]]/Local Security Policy user interface

* Installing without requiring a product key during setup for retail and OEM versions

====Previously released updates====
Service Pack 3 also incorporated several previously released key updates for Windows XP, which were not included up to SP2, including:
* [[Windows Imaging Component]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947898/en-us Information about Windows Imaging Component].&lt;/ref&gt;
* IPSec Simple Policy Update for simplified creation and maintenance of [[IPSec]] filters&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/914841/en-us How to simplify the creation and maintenance of Internet Protocol (IPsec) security filters in Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Background Intelligent Transfer Service]] (BITS) 2.5
* [[MSXML]] 6.0 SP2 and XMLLite
* [[Microsoft Management Console]] 3.0
* Credential Roaming service (Digital Identity Management Service) update
* [[Remote Desktop Protocol]] 6.1
* [[Peer Name Resolution Protocol]] 2.1
* Network Diagnostics update
* [[WPA2]] Update (KB893357)
* [[Windows Script]] 5.7
* [[Windows Installer]] 3.1 v2
* [[Wireless Zero Configuration|Wireless LAN]] API ([http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918997/ KB918997])
* Improvements made to [[Windows Management Instrumentation]] in Windows Vista to reduce the possibility of corruption of the WMI repository.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;933062 A hotfix is available that improves the stability of the Windows Management Instrumentation repository in Windows XP]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slipstream (computing)|Slipstreamed]] retail and OEM versions of Windows XP with SP3 can be installed and run with full functionality for 30 days without a product key, after which time the user will be prompted to enter a valid key and [[Microsoft Product Activation|activate]] the installation. [[Volume license key]] (VLK) versions still require entering a product key before beginning installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3227350&amp;SiteID=17 Slipstreamed SP3 still asks for product key].&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows XP Service Pack 3 is a cumulative update of all previous service packs for XP. The service pack installer checks ''HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows\CSDVersion'' registry key to see if has a value greater than or equal to 0x100, and if it does it will allow the update to proceed. Otherwise it will prompt to install either XP SP1 or SP2. Since SP1 is no longer available for full download, it would need to be downloaded using Windows Update. The other option is to manually change the registry key, in essence fooling the installer into thinking SP1 is already installed.&lt;ref name=technetsp3install&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsxp/cc164204.aspx#1 Installing Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is possible to slipstream SP3 into the Windows XP setup files at any service pack level, including the original RTM version, without any errors or issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3226434&amp;SiteID=17 | title=&lt;nowiki&gt;To Chris Keroack [MSFT]  - Slipstreaming&lt;/nowiki&gt; | accessdate=May 19, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080503101223/http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3226434&amp;SiteID=17 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slipstreaming SP3 into Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 is not supported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3236131&amp;SiteID=17 Slipstreaming SP3 with MCE 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

Service Pack 3 contains updates to the operating system components of Windows XP Media Center Edition (MCE) and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, and security updates for .NET Framework version 1.0, which is included in these Windows XP [[Stock-keeping unit|SKU]]s. However, it does not include update rollups for the [[Windows Media Center]] application in Windows XP MCE 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP3FAQ&quot;&gt;[http://forums.microsoft.com/TechNet/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=3215341&amp;SiteID=17 FAQs regarding SP3 RTM].&lt;/ref&gt; SP3 also omits security updates for Windows Media Player 10, although the player is included in Windows XP MCE 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP3FAQ&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- PLEASE DON'T ADD WMP 11 HERE SINCE IT IS ''not'' INCLUDED IN ANY WINDOWS XP SKU.

On April 14, 2009, Windows XP and its family of operating systems were moved from Mainstream Support to the Extended Support phase as it marks the progression of the legacy operating system through the Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy.  During the Extended Support Phase, Microsoft will continue to provide security updates every month for Windows XP; however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes are no longer being offered.

On April 8, 2014, all Windows XP support, including security updates and security-related hotfixes, will be terminated.&lt;ref name=lifecycle/&gt; Users are recommended to upgrade to [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/springboard/archive/2011/07/11/with-only-1000-days-left-of-extended-support-don-t-you-think-it-s-time-to-retire-windows-xp.aspx|title=With only 1000 days left of extended support, donât you think itâs time to retire Windows XP?|last=Rose|first=Stephen L|date=July 11, 2011|work=The Windows Blog|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January, 14, 2020, downgrade support for Windows XP ends, making the operating system officially obsolete.

==License and media types==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2008}}
There are three main types of Windows XP licenses: Retail, Volume (VLK), and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). All three types of licenses are available for Windows XP Professional ([[32-bit]] and 64-bit). Windows XP Home Edition is limited to ''Retail'' and ''OEM'' licenses whereas Windows XP Media Center Edition and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition are exclusively available through ''VLK'' and ''OEM'' licenses.

Each type of license has a different installation CD. For customized or retail media, there is a small difference on each type of disc that will allow that installation disc to accept only one type of product key.

Only retail and volume licenses include support for end-user installation scenarios from Microsoft. OEM software is preinstalled on systems and is supported by the system manufacturer rather than Microsoft. The price of such software is lower.  There are two important restrictions on OEM licenses: Microsoft does not offer technical support, and the license cannot be transferred to another computer.  The cost of OEM software products bundled with systems is not disclosed by Microsoft nor by its partners, as each system manufacturer will define its own bundling price.

Microsoft recommends that system manufacturers have their systems tested, for a fee, as part of the Windows Quality Online Services (Winqual) which includes extensive testing so that no component will cause instability in the Windows operating system due to incompatibility with the Windows operating system or with other system components or their respective drivers. Having a system tested and approved will allow the manufacturer to bear the &quot;Certified for Windows&quot; logo sticker on the exterior of the system, and there are additional benefits for having a tested product. This includes the product's being listed on the Windows Marketplace. Because of the fees and extensive requirements, Microsoft acknowledges that smaller system manufacturers may not opt in to the program until they produce computer systems at a modest rate and on recurring designs.

===Retail===
Retail licenses, those purchased from a retail store in full packaging, are of two sub-types: &quot;Upgrade&quot; and &quot;Full Purchase Product&quot;, often abbreviated by Microsoft as FPP. FPP licenses are transferable from one computer to another, provided the previous installation is removed from the old computer. Although upgrade licenses are also transferable, a user must have a previous version of Windows even on the new computer to which they are moving the installation.  Retail licenses include installation support for end-users, provided directly by Microsoft.

===Volume License===
A Volume License is the license given to a software version sold to businesses under a direct purchase agreement with Microsoft, and is sold as an upgrade license only, meaning that a previous license must be available for each new volume license. Volume license versions of Windows XP use a [[Volume License Key]] (VLK), which is a product key that does not require [[Microsoft Product Activation|product activation]]. The term &quot;Volume License Key&quot; refers to the ability to use one product key for multiple systems, depending on the type of agreement. Since Windows XP Volume License versions do not require product activation, this led to leaked copies of VLK media and product keys from businesses leading to piracy of Windows XP quickly spreading across the Internet upon early release. Beginning with Service Pack 1, Microsoft's active attempts to search out and blacklist known pirated VLK product keys became well known due to the inability to install the service pack on a system with one of the blacklisted keys. Later, this led to the [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] program.

===Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)===
[[Original equipment manufacturer#Software|Original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM) licenses are preinstalled on, and sold with, pre-assembled computers from system manufacturers. There are two types of OEM product types&amp;nbsp;â those used for &quot;direct OEMs&quot; (major name brands that buy through a direct contract with Microsoft and produce and brand their own media from a Microsoft &quot;Gold Master Copy&quot; by using an authorized Microsoft duplication partner), and those used for &quot;system builders&quot; (local computer shops that buy generic, unbranded kits through authorized Microsoft distributors). Direct OEM product keys will often not activate with system builder installation media because direct OEMs are now required by Microsoft to pre-activate their copies in the factory using their own internal mechanism before delivery to the customer. It is recommended that system builders also pre-activate their systems before delivery, but this is not mandatory.

OEM installations can be customized using the Microsoft OEM Preinstallation Kit with branding, logos, additional applications, optional services, alternate applications for certain Windows components, Internet Explorer links, and various other customizations. All OEM customers must include support and contact information for the initial installation of Windows because it is the responsibility for the OEM to support the Windows installation, and is not provided by Microsoft to the end-user. Direct OEMs must create their own media, but have the option of creating their own custom recovery solution, which may or may not be similar to a generic installation. Direct OEMs may provide a recovery partition on the hard drive as the custom recovery solution rather than providing disc-based media with the computer.

Some end-users have found this to be a troublesome option, because in the event of an out-of-warranty hard drive failure, they may not have access to any installation media in order to reinstall Windows onto a new hard drive. System builders are not allowed the option to create a custom recovery CD/DVD media. The only deliverable media available for a system builder to give to the end-user is the unbranded OEM system builder hologram media kit. Because of this, when end-users reformat their hard drives and re-install from the installation media, they lose all the custom branding and support information that the system builder would have included.

As a supplemental recovery method to a CD/DVD-based installation, a system builder may employ a fully customized recovery solution on the hard drive. Whether utilizing a recovery partition or not, a system builder must still include the original generic OEM system builder hologram CD/DVD media kit. OEM licenses are not transferable from one computer to another. Every computer sold/resold with an OEM license must include all of the original installation media or recovery solution, documentation, Certificate of Authenticity, and product key sticker with the sale. Microsoft requires that all OEM system manufacturers include as part of the configuration the Windows Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE), which is the initial setup wizard encountered the first time Windows boots up. It is also required that value-added resellers (VAR's), retailers, and general resellers not tamper with the OEM's customized OOBE mechanism unless under permission by the OEM, and it is a recommended configuration for systems that are privately resold so that a customer will have a like-new computer experience upon first boot-up.

OEM licenses are to be installed by professional system manufacturers only. Under Microsoft's OEM License Agreement, they are not to be sold to end-users under any circumstance, and are to be preinstalled on a computer using the OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) before shipment to the customer, and must include at the very least the manufacturer's support contact information. They are, therefore, designed for installation only on a single computer and are not transferable, even if the original computer is no longer in use. This is not usually an issue for users who purchase new computer systems, because most pre-assembled systems ship with a preinstalled operating system. There are few circumstances where Microsoft will allow the transfer of an OEM license from one non-functioning system to another, but the OEM System Builder License Agreement (SBLA), as well as the OEM End User License Agreement (EULA) do not contain any allowance for this, so it is entirely up to Microsoft's discretion, depending on the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oem.microsoft.com |title=Microsoft OEM Partner Center Website|accessdate=August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-use by end user====
In the event that an end user decides that they do not wish to use a preinstalled version of Windows, Microsoft's [[Software license agreement|End User License Agreement (EULA)]] provides that the software may be returned to the OEM for a refund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2006/110706-dell-windows.html|title=Dell customer gets Windows refund|author=Don Marti|publisher=Linuxworld|date=November 6, 2006|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been enforced by courts in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/english/newsticker/news/98106|title=HP must reimburse Italian PC buyer the amount paid for Microsoft software|publisher=Heise online|date=October 29, 2007|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cebit.de/newsanzeige_d?news=30814&amp;tag=1190757601&amp;source=%2Fnewsarchiv_e&amp;noindex=|title=Ruling: Acer must refund purchase price of preinstalled software that is not being used|publisher=[[Cebit]]|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=March 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
