'''Ubuntu One''' is a personal [[Cloud computing|cloud]] service operated by [[Canonical Ltd]].

The service enables users to store files online and sync them between computers and mobile devices, as well as stream audio and music from cloud to mobile devices.

== Features ==

Ubuntu One has a client application that runs on Ubuntu 9.04 and later or Windows XP or newer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://one.ubuntu.com/downloads/ |title=Ubuntu One: Downloads |accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of | 2009}} no Ubuntu One clients run under [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jjesse.wordpress.com/2009/05/15/ubuntu-one-live-mesh-and-dropbox-a-comparison |title=Ubuntu One, Live Mesh, and Dropbox: A Comparison Â« A Conservative Techie |publisher=Jjesse.wordpress.com |date=2009-05-15 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free Ubuntu One account offers 5 GB of storage. Users may increase their storage by adding additional 20 GB &quot;20-packs&quot; for $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year.

âUbuntu One Music Streamingâ offers music-streaming apps for iPhone and Android phones. The âMusic Streamingâ package costs $3.99 a month or $39.99 per year.

The Ubuntu One service is similar to services such as  [[SpiderOak]], [[Dropbox (storage provider)|Dropbox]], [[Box.net]], [[Mozy]], [[Wuala]], [[Amazon Cloud Player]], [[Google Music]], [[Humyo]], [[iDisk]], [[Jungle Disk]] and [[Live Mesh]]. Its client code is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. It uses [[Twisted (software)|Twisted]] for its low-level networking and [[Protocol Buffers]] for protocol description.

Additional features like the integration with other services sets Ubuntu One apart from the other similar service-providers. Examples include the automatic upload of photos taken from Android mobile devices for immediate sync across computers; integration with [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] for contacts and with [[Tomboy (software)|Tomboy]] for notes due to the access to the local [[CouchDB]] instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/Relaxed-Ubuntu-9.10-CouchDB-to-be-Integrated |title=Relaxed Ubuntu 9.10: CouchDB to be Integrated - Linux Magazine Online |publisher=Linux-magazine.com |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Further possibilities include the capability of editing the contacts, as well as the Tomboy notes, online via the Ubuntu One Web interface; synching contacts with mobile devices; and purchasing [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-free music while synchronizing them automatically with an Ubuntu One Account via the Ubuntu One Music Store (in partnership with [[7digital]]).

== Application Developer Program ==

Ubuntu One publishes APIs for developers wishing to build applications utilizing file and data synchronization or music streaming.

==Criticism==
Ubuntu One has been criticized within the Ubuntu Community for its server software being [[Proprietary software|proprietary]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-servers/+bug/375272 Bug #375272 in Ubuntu One Servers: Â«Server software is closed sourceÂ» â Launchpad]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2010/01/14/ubuntu-debian.html |title=Back Home, with Debian! |quote=UbuntuOne's server side system is proprietary software with no prospects of liberation. |author=Bradley M. Kuhn|date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There is not yet a native client integration for the [[Kubuntu]] variant of the Ubuntu operating system (as of June 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntuone-client/+bug/375145 |title=Launchpad bug #375145 - Ubuntu One should have a KDE client | accessdate=2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubuntu integration is under development and has also received a grant from the Google Summer of Code 2010.

Further criticism concerns the choice of the patented [[mp3]] format for the music of the Ubuntu One Music Store and the unclear revenue share that will be granted to the community. The [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]] development team has announced that they will not add support for the Ubuntu One Music Store to the Amarok media player for the moment, unlike what they have done with [[Magnatune]] media store, which funds the project with 10% of the revenue produced via the interface to the store built in Amarok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.magnatune.com/2008/04/giving-money-to.html|title=buckman's magnatune blog: Giving money to open source|accessdate=2011-12-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
