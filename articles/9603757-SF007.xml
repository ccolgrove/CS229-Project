'''Sirius XM Radio Inc.''' ({{NASDAQ|SIRI}}) is an [[United States|American]] [[broadcasting]] company that provides two [[satellite radio]] services ([[SDARS]]) operating in the United States, [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and [[XM Satellite Radio]]. The company also owns a minority interest in [[Sirius XM Canada]], an affiliate company which provides Sirius and XM service in [[Canada]]. The company in its current incarnation was formed following the acquisition of XM Satellite Radio, Inc. by Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. on July 29, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters080729&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSN2926292520080730?sp=true |title=Sirius completes acquisition of XM Satellite |work=Reuters.com |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2007, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio announced a merger that would combine the two radio services and create a single satellite radio network in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;xmpr1423&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://xmradio.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=1423 |title=XM and Sirius to Combine in $13 Billion Merger of Equals |publisher=PRNewswire-FirstCall ''via'' Mediaroom |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spr230306&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://investor.sirius.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=230306 |title=XM and Sirius to Combine in $13 Billion Merger of Equals |publisher=PRNewswire-FirstCall ''via'' Sirius.com |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2007-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger brought the combined companies a total of more than 18.5 million subscribers based on current subscriber numbers on the date of merging.

The proposed merger was controversial because, in 1997, the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) granted only two licenses and, in order to ensure a state of competition, stipulated that one of the holders would not be permitted to acquire control of the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahrens Washington Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072503026.html?hpid=topnews|title=Satellite Radio Merger Approved|last=Ahrens|first=Frank |date=July 26, 2008|pages=Washington Post | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each share of XM stock was replaced with 4.6 shares of Sirius. Each company's stockholders initially retain approximately 50% of the joined company. Sirius CEO [[Mel Karmazin]] became CEO of the new company, and XM chairman [[Gary Parsons]] was named chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;eo4980805&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/fetchFilingFrameset.aspx?FilingID=4980805&amp;Type=HTML |title=SEC Filing by Sirius Satellite Radio |publisher=Edgar-Online.com |date=2007-02-21 |accessdate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; XM CEO [[Hugh Panero]] stepped down in August 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;xmpr1473&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://xmradio.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&amp;item=1473 |title=XM Chief Executive CEO Hugh Panero to Step Aside |publisher=XM Radio ''via'' PRNewswire-FirstCall |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, SiriusXM announced that the company will offer personal radio channels like Pandora. &lt;ref name=SoSirius&gt; Charlie White, Mashable. &quot;[http://mashable.com/2011/08/05/siriusxm-newfeatures/ SiriusXM To Get Pandora-Like Upgrade].&quot; August 5, 2011.

==Stated benefits of the merger==
===Cost===
Because both companies will operate as one, this may reduce the cost of licensing the broadcast material. It will also almost certainly reduce the staff required to run the company. Also, programming can be spread out among the companies' combined satellite constellations

===Variety===
If all of the non-duplicate channels are kept, this will result in more programming being made available to subscribers of both services.  However, since May of 2011, SiriusXM has been systematically dropping stations.  Additionally, the music playlists on remaining stations are diminishing and duplicative.

===New development===
With only one company to develop products for, the new company can afford to spend more money to develop new products.&lt;ref name=&quot;xmmHazlett&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xmmerger.com/uploads/Hazlett_Paper_with_Transmittal_-_Final.pdf |title=The Economics of the Satellite Radio Merger |work=XMMerger.com |first=Thomas |last=Hazlett |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2007-07-31|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, services have been developed which were not even conceived of when satellite radio was launched. XM and Sirius now carry satellite weather and traffic, and Sirius launched television programming in 2007. Likewise, it is expected that new technologies and products will continue to be developed and integrated in to the combined infrastructure of XM and Sirius Radio.

===Competition===
Both companies were losing money before the merger, and were rumored to be facing bankruptcy.  The company argued that merger was the way to avoid bankruptcy, and that bankruptcy would result in diminished competition for existing terrestrial radio and streaming services like Pandora.

==Opposition arguments==
The main opposition to the merger is the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB) and the Consumer Coalition for Competition in Satellite Radio (a group run by the NAB). NAB representatives have been present at both Congressional hearings, and have produced several advertisements regarding the merger. The NAB's contention is that the merged company will be a [[monopoly]], and that their increased market power will harm consumers. Four primary concerns are proposed.

===Innovation===
XM and Sirius are constantly developing new products. The original satellite receivers were larger and offered fewer features than modern receivers. The argument is that XM's competition with Sirius has prodded this progress.

===Competition===
Arguments against the merger state that none of the economic studies offered by XM and Sirius prove that the relevant product market is any larger than satellite radio services under the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commissionâs long-established Horizontal Merger Guidelines. Therefore, because XM and Sirius are the only two competitors in the satellite radio industry, it has been argued that their combination would result in a merger to monopoly, clearly in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, which forbids mergers that may tend to lessen competition substantially.&lt;ref name=&quot;thirdsupplementaldec&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1018495 |title=Third Supplemental Declaration of J.

Because their merger could not prevail under the standard established by the Merger Guidelines, XM and Sirius sought to apply a different standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;lessonsfromtheproposedmergerofxmandsirius&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1088450 |title= Evaluating Market Power with Two-Sided Demand and Preemptive Offers to Dissipate Monopoly Rent: Lessons for High-Technology Industries from the Proposed Merger of XM and Sirius Satellite Radio |work=Social Science Research Network |first=J Gregory |last=Sidak |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Goldman Sachs]] analyst Mark Wienkes identified MP3 players as significant competitors to satellite radio, specifically the announced music streaming capabilities of the 2nd generation [[iPhone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt iphone streaming&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/13/aol-turns-the-iphone-into-an-expensive-radio/?hp|title=AOL Turns the iPhone Into an Expensive Radio|last=Hansell|first=Saul |date=June 13, 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sachs&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/19/AR2008061903242.html|title=XM, Sirius Plunge After Merger Report|last=Kang|first=Cecilia |date=June 20, 2008|work=Washington Post|pages=D1|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- I only included services that could be used on cell phones and are available in the US.  --&gt;

While the accessibility of Internet streaming music was downplayed during the merger hearings, the popular iPhone and Blackberry portable devices have changed that. There are a few services attempting to compete directly with Sirus XM by streaming audio to a user's cell phone.

* ClearChannel Communications offers [[iheartradio|I â¥ Radio]], an application that offers all of ClearChannel's radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iheartradio.com/national_radio_tuner/main.html&lt;/ref&gt; This includes news, live talk radio, and music. It is designed for the iPhone and Blackberry portable devices.
* [[Pandora (music service)|Pandora]] and [[Slacker (music service)|Slacker]] also offer on-line listening on various handheld devices, including the iPhone, Blackberry. Unlike satellite radio, Pandora and Slacker do not offer news, talk programs or live DJ's. They do track the listeners' preferences and tailor the music based on the listeners' tastes.

===Programming===
Sirius and XM have both used star power to attract consumers. [[Howard Stern]], [[Opie and Anthony]], [[Bubba the Love Sponge]], [[Scott Ferrall]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Ron &amp; Fez]], [[Broadminded]], [[Bam Margera]], [[Tony Hawk]], [[Jason Ellis]], [[Martha Stewart]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]] are among the stars that have signed contracts with one of the two companies. Exclusive sports programming (The [[National Football League]], [[Barclays Premier League]], [[Canadian Football League]] and [[NASCAR]] on Sirius and [[Major League Baseball]], [[National Basketball Association]], [[National Hockey League]], [[PGA Tour]], and [[Indy Racing League]] on XM) also drives consumers to one network or the other. Sirius and XM executives hope to lower the cost of this programming by merging; critics argue that the lowered cost will result in less total programming being made available. In particular, marquee sports and talk shows could be offered a la carte, similar to premium digital/satellite television tiers and out-of-market sports packages.

Programming changes beginning November 12, 2008, included the elimination of niche programming in the genres of [[punk rock]] and early [[hip-hop]], with devotees of these channels diverted to themed shows on the Action Sports and Hip-Hop Hits channels, respectively. Sirius removed Backspin 43 and the Beat 36 while directing listeners to different stations with no relation to the stations which were removed. [[Classic rock|Gold-based]] [[active rock]] channel [[Boneyard (station)|Boneyard]] was pre-empted for AC/DC Radio at the same time, whereas Sirius's [[BuzzSaw]] was entirely dropped.  Fans of XM 82, &quot;The System&quot; have been redirected to [[Electric Area|Area]]. The [[Mashup (music)|mashup]]/[[breakbeats]] channel Boombox and freeform station &quot;[[Sirius Disorder]]&quot; were not replaced, while fans of the [[disco]] channel [[Chrome (XM)|Chrome]] were diverted to the more general 1970s channel '70's on 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;new-programming&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sirius.com/newlineup |title=New Channel Lineup:Music |work=sirius.com |accessdate=2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2009, due to subscriber demand, Boneyard, [[The Strobe]] and [[BackSpin]] were returned to the line-up on both services.   Also, The Beat Morning Show with Geronimo was added on BPM.  This show only lasted until June 13, 2009, when BPM dropped the BEAT Morning Show from the lineup and the website.  Subscribers are still upset with the new channel line-up, based on discussions from the various Facebook pages of their respective channel.  One, for example, The Sirius subscribers are wanting The BEAT returned and the XM subscribers are wanting BPM back pre-merger. On October 22, 2010, Sirius XM dropped The Strobe from the lineup and moved the channel to its online service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/notes/the-strobe/the-strobe-becomes-a-sirius-xm-online-service-channel-effective-6-pm-et-102210/446430057675?ref=mf &quot;The STROBE Becomes a Sirius XM Online Service channel effective 6 PM ET 10/22/10&quot;] from The Strobe's [[Facebook]] page (October 22, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirius XM also removed internationally renowned British music station [[BBC Radio 1]] from its channel lineup on August 9th, 2011 without any warning to its subscribers. After thousands of angry customers started a campaign using social media to reinstate BBC Radio 1 on Sirius XM, the channel was added to Sirius XM's online service. This did not quell the uproar from BBC Radio 1 fans, who continued their fight into October, 2011. &lt;ref&gt;www.facebook.com/SaveRadio1inNorthAmerica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian counterparts==
In [[Canada]], [[Sirius Canada]] and [[XM Canada]] are partially owned by Sirius XM (20% and 23.3% respectively) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2008/07/30/xm-sirius-conflict.html |title=XM, Sirius merger in U.S. raises competition concerns in Canada |work=CBC News |first=Paul |last=Jay |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[joint venture]]s with Canadian companies. The two Canadian ventures did not immediately agree to a similar merger, but instead remained in competition as distinct services.&lt;ref name=vlessing&gt;Etan Vlessing, &quot;XM-Sirius merger not replicated in Canada&quot;. ''Hollywood Reporter'', July 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating matters was that Sirius Canada has nearly 80% of the total satellite radio subscriber base in that country, and felt they deserved greater than a 50/50 split of the new company, whereas XM Canada felt that their deal with the National Hockey League â a particularly lucrative prize in Canadian sports broadcasting â also warranted a significant amount of value in the new company.&lt;ref name=vlessing /&gt;

Even if the two Canadian systems combined, they still would not be able to provide the same channel line-up as Sirius XM in the US because of the services' [[Canadian content]] license requirements. The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) and the Canadian [[Competition Bureau]] would have to approve any merger between XM Canada and Sirius Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2008/07/30/xm-sirius-conflict.html |title=XM, Sirius merger in U.S. raises competition concerns in Canada |work=CBC News |first=Paul |last=Jay |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 24, 2010, XM Radio Canada and Sirius Canada announced that they will merge their services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/finally-sirius-canada-and-xm-canada-are-merging |title=Finally, Sirius Canada and XM Canada are merging |date=November 24, 2010 |work=Radio-Info.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 12, 2011, the CRTC approved the companies' merger into [[Sirius XM Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/89975/crtc-approves-sirius-xm-merger-in-canada &quot;CRTC Approves Sirius XM Merger In Canada&quot;] from All Access (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Bitove]]'s Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings Inc., the licensee of XM Canada, will hold a 30 per cent share in the new company as its primary and controlling shareholder, while [[Slaight Communications]] and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], the current owners of Sirius Canada, will each retain 20 per cent ownership and Sirius XM's American parent company will hold 25 per cent.&lt;ref name=&quot;crtc&quot;/&gt; The merger was completed on June 21, 2011.&lt;ref name=broadcaster&gt;[http://www.broadcastermagazine.com/news/sirius-canada-and-xm-canada-complete-merger/1000486539/ &quot;Sirius Canada and XM Canada Complete Merger&quot;]. ''[[Broadcaster (magazine)|Broadcaster]]'', June 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical==
===Receivers===
Currently, XM and Sirius use different [[Data compression|compression]] and [[conditional access]] systems, making their receivers incompatible with each other's service, though both companies have guaranteed that existing receivers will be able to receive content from both services after the merger.

Executives from both companies have stated that XM and Sirius will continue to operate as separate services. Buying another radio to receive programming from the other service will be optional.&lt;ref name=&quot;cir69614&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ut0226&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2007-02-26-sirius-usat_x.htm |title=Sirius CEO discusses post-XM merger service plans |work=USA Today |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sa28069&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/28069 |title=XM Satellite Radio Q4 2006 Earnings Call Transcript |work=SeekingAlpha.com |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a unified receiver that can receive programming from both networks would allow subscribers to listen to the entire range of channels. [[Interoperable Technologies]], a [[joint venture]] of both companies, was formed in 2003 and announced such a receiver in 2006. Mel Karmazin has confirmed the existence and operation of the radio, &quot;We have one. It's in my office.&quot; Karmazin's dual system radio can expect competitorsâaccording to tech-site ''Gizmodo'', [[Onkyo]] is entering the interoperable radio arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;giz254920&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/onkyo-debuts-worlds-first-xm-sirius-hd-radio-tuner-254920.php |title=Onkyo Debuts World's First XM, Sirius, HD Radio Tuner |work=Gizmodo |first=Louis |last=Ramirez |date=2007-04-24 |accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subscriber growth is expected to slow significantly as consumers wait for interoperable receivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;sachs&quot; /&gt;

===Satellites===
Currently, there are nine satellites in orbit; five XM and four Sirius satellites{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Each company also has a ground spare, of identical construction to its first generation of satellite{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. The most recent satellite is XM-5, which was launched by [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] on October 14, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilslaunch.com/news-070109 |title=ILS Proton Successfully Launches SIRIUS FM-5 Satellite |publisher=ILS |date=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The XM Radio satellites use [[S band]] frequencies from 2,332.50 through 2,345.00 MHz, and Sirius Radio use adjacent frequencies 2,320.00 through 2,332.50 MHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/satradiofreq.html|publisher=CSG Networks|accessdate=2011-11-09|title=Satellite S Band Radio Frequency Table}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no publicly available facts concerning the cross-compatibility of the satellites themselves. If it is possible to use XM satellites to propagate Sirius's signal, this would give Sirius immediate access to a second geostationary satellite, which would improve reception for stationary receivers, such as those at businesses and homes. In the long term, consolidating transponders on to fewer satellites will reduce infrastructure costs significantly: to build and launch one satellite can cost more than US$300 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes0609&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/technology/wireless/2005/06/09/0609automarketscan06.html |title=XM Could Launch XM-4 Satellite A Year Early |work=Forbes |date=2005-06-09 |accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a lifetime of approximately 15 years. Once the next generation of satellites is constructed and operating, combining satellite networks could result in a savings of US$40 million a year.

===Internet===
[[File:Siriusxm internet radio.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Sirius XM Internet Radio]]
Sirius XM radio content is also available over the Internet, competing for listeners of [[Internet radio]] stations and other online music services. The Internet-only option is offered for US $12.95 a month &lt;ref&gt;http://mobilenewz.net/2009/06/sirius-xm-coming-to-itunes-apps-store/&lt;/ref&gt; and does not require a stand alone radio receiver or additional computer hardware.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/06/sirius-xm-releases-lite-iphone-app-wtf/&lt;/ref&gt;
There are internet radio receivers that will stream the internet streams of SiriusXM channels with the add-on internet subscription.  Internet radios by [[Grace Digital]] have this capability, provided the user has a current internet account with user name and password.

==Mobile device applications==
===iPhone and iPod Touch===
Sirius XM on June 17, 2009, released a software application for use on the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPhone]] and Apple [[iPod Touch]] devices thatallow its subscribers and users of those devices to listen to its programming. The application does not feature all of the programming available to satellite listeners. The company addresses this in the frequently asked questions section for the application,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siriusxm.com/oniphone/indexd.xmc?utm_source=ONIPHONEDIRECT&amp;utm_medium=Other&amp;utm_campaign=APP#faq12 Sirius XM Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; stating:
{{cquote|SIRIUS &amp; XM offer all of the channels for which we have mobile performance rights. For that reason, certain channels which may be available on your satellite radio or online radio service may not be available on a mobile device like the iPhone.}}

===BlackBerry===
Sirius XM has also developed an application for use on certain [[3G]] enabled Rim [[BlackBerry]] smartphones. Much like its iPhone and iPod Touch counterpart, it features a restricted 120 channel lineup featuring most of the music channels and selected talk programming. As with the iPhone app, some select programming, including MLB Play-by-Play, and SIRIUS NASCAR Radio, are not available at this time on the Blackberry.  However, NFL Play-by-play was added in late 2010, as before you could only hear the talk-oriented daily programming. due to licensing and exclusivity deals, some play-by-play is not available, such is the case for both MLB and NASCAR, both online rights being owned by Turner Sports Interactive.

Blackberry smartphones currently compatible with the Sirius app:
*[[BlackBerry Curve 8500]]
*[[BlackBerry Curve 8900]]
*[[BlackBerry Bold]]
*[[BlackBerry Storm]]
*[[BlackBerry Storm 2]]
*[[BlackBerry Tour]]
*[[BlackBerry Bold 9700]]

===Android===
On May 28, 2010, Sirius XM released an application for mobile devices using the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]. It features the same 120 channels of commercial-free music, news, talk radio, sports talk, and entertainment channels as found on the iPhone/iPod Touch and Blackberry applications.  In August 2010, the Froyo release of Android broke the Sirius XM application.  Sirius XM has since released an updated client that works with Froyo.

Devices that are compatible with the Sirius XM app for Android include the [[Droid Incredible|Droid Incredible by HTC]], the [[Motorola Droid]], [[HTC Hero|the HTC Hero]], [[Motorola CLIQ|the Motorola Cliq]], and the Google's [[Nexus One]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SIRIUS XM Radio Android App Now Available|url=http://investor.sirius.com/releases.cfm|accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
* All music programming are now exact duplicates on both services, with the following exceptions:
** Six channels ([[Bollywood &amp; Beyond]], [[Nashville!]], [[KISS-XM]], [[MIX (XM)|MIX]], [[The Music Summit]], and [[Rock@Random]]) are owned by [[Clear Channel Communications]], still air commercials, and are exclusive to XM subscribers.
** All Canadian music channels remain exclusive to their respective platforms, as the corresponding Canadian providers have yet to merge. Sirius Canada channels include [[CBC Radio 3]], [[Iceberg Radio]], [[Bande Ã  part (radio)|Bande Ã  part]], [[L'Oasis francophone]], and [[Latitude franco]]. XM Canada channels include [[The Verge (XM)|The Verge]], [[Sur La Route]], [[Air Musique]] and [[Radio ParallÃ¨le]]. These channels are also available to online listeners of their respective providers, but only to Canadian subscribers.
** There are also a handful of in-house programmed channels exclusive to each platform. XM exclusives include [[The Groove (XM)|The Groove]], [[The Village (XM)|The Village]],  [[The Power (XM)|The Power]], and [[Cinemagic (XM)|Cinemagic]]. Sirius has no exclusive channels. Limited bandwidth prevents these channels from being made available to both services, but the reasons they were chosen to be left out are unclear. However, all these channels are available to online listeners of both Sirius Internet Radio and XM Radio Online.
* The merger conference call announced that previously exclusive content, including sports and talk, will be folded into one unified service which offers &quot;even more channel capacity&quot; and a la carte ordering of premium services (the ability to order a single channel or small subset of channels).
* CEO Karmazin said in an interview that both the XM and Sirius brands will be offered as separate brands/services for the next 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ut0226&quot;/&gt; Any combined or unified services would be in addition to these separate services.
* Members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] have criticized the planned merger saying that commitments to devote 12 channels to minority-owned programming is not enough.&lt;ref name=sachs/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black caucus&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/16/AR2008061602470.html|title=Radio Merger Under Fire From Black Lawmakers|last=Birnbaum|first= Jeffrey H. |date=June 17, 2008|work=Washington Post|pages=D1|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sirius XM reported that they have 18,515,730 total subscribers as of the third quarter of 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sirius XM Press Release 3Q 2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://investor.sirius.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=422100|title=SIRIUS XM Radio Reports Third Quarter 2009 Results|accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial==
* Both companies compete primarily with free services. Executives from XM and Sirius both made it clear that they do not want to slow down the adoption of satellite radio, so they hope not to increase the subscriber price, but to gain new revenues from new services: video, navigation, and advertising.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}
* One concern voiced by some subscribers regards the Sirius lifetime subscription: for a one-time fee, Sirius subscribers were able to obtain a lifetime subscription for a receiver. This subscription is tied to the individual receiver, and there was a concern that the subscription may not transfer to a new universal receiver. However, Sirius' [[FAQ]] page regarding the merger states that &quot;Any plan you sign up for now will be honored by the merged company.&quot; As they also have guaranteed that no radio will become obsolete, it is likely that this concern will be addressed via some new, merged signal.&lt;ref name=&quot;sirfaq&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buy.sirius.com/resources/faq.html |title=Sirius/XM Merger |work=Sirius.com |accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* While both companies declare the deal to be a &quot;merger of equals&quot;, Bloomberg reports Sirius will acquire XM for US$4.57 billion in stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloom087&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aJkk0aQ7fmGQ&amp;refer=home |title=Sirius to Acquire Larger Rival XM for $4.57 Billion |work=Bloomberg |first=Christopher |last=Stern |date=2007-02-19 |accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Stock prices of XM dropped 17% and Sirius dropped 12% on 2008-06-19 after a report by [[Goldman Sachs]] analyst Mark Wienkes predicted that cash flows of the combined company would be impacted by increased competition from MP3 players and new streaming capabilities of the iPhone. The report predicted that the combined companies would have to take on $500 million to $1 billion in new debt and recommended that stock holders sell their XM and Sirius stock. Subscriber growth of both companies is expected to slow as consumers wait for receivers which are interoperable between the 2 companies to become available.&lt;ref name=&quot;sachs&quot;/&gt;
* Current {{When|date=February 2011}} economic conditions and both company's mounting debt could make the merger a necessity to refinance the debt of both companies. This is especially for XM which faces $400 million in [[Convertible bond|convertible notes]] which come due in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestreet.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestreet.com/s/can-xm-sirius-survive-if-merger-doesnt/newsanalysis/hardware/10421814.html?puc=_htmlbtb|title=Can XM, Sirius Survive a Failed Deal?|last=Holmes|first=Robert|date=2008-06-18|work=TheStreet.com|accessdate=2008-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nearing bankruptcy in February 2009, Sirius' stock price had dropped to an all-time low of $0.05 per share. Sirius was, however, able to get emergency financing, some $500,000,000, from media mogul [[John Malone]], who took a 40% equity stake in the company.

===Executive compensation===
Executives who were not offered jobs in the new combined company were assured generous [[golden parachute]]s due to severance agreements approved in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://washington.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2008/08/04/story7.html?b=1217822400^1677932|title=Severance deals protect XM Satellite executives|last=Darcy|first=Darlene |date=August 1, 2008|publisher=Washington Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Former XM Radio Chief Executive Officer Nate Davis had a severance package worth $10 million.
* Gary Parsons, the former Chairman of Sirius XM Radio, received $9 million.
* Erik Toppenberg, Executive Vice President of Programming for XM Radio, has a severance package worth $5.34 million.
* Joseph Euteneuer, Chief Financial Officer for XM Radio, has a severance package worth $4.9 million.
* Vernon Irvin, Chief Marketing Officer, has a severance package worth $4.5 million.
