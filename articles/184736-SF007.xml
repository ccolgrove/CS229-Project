'''Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting''' ('''FAIR''') is a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[media criticism]] organization based in [[New York City]], founded in 1986.
 
FAIR describes itself on its website as &quot;the national media [[watchdog journalism|watch group]]&quot; and defines its mission as working to &quot;invigorate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by advocating for greater [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in the press and by scrutinizing media practices that marginalize public interest, minority and dissenting viewpoints.&quot; FAIR refers to itself as a &quot;progressive group that believes that structural reform is ultimately needed to break up the dominant [[media conglomerates]], establish independent [[public broadcasting]] and promote strong [[non-profit]] sources of information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=100 What's FAIR?], FAIR Website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media outlets ==
First published in 1987, ''[[Extra!]]'', FAIR's bi-monthly magazine, features analysis of current [[media bias]], [[censorship]], and effects of media consolidation. Covering a variety of issues, FAIR addresses news coverage that it finds biased with rebuttals. FAIR also produces ''[[Counterspin|CounterSpin]]'', a half-hour radio program hosted by [[Janine Jackson]], Steve Rendall, and Peter Hart, recorded at MercerMedia in NYC. It [[broadcasting|broadcasts]] nationally on over 130 radio stations and is available in [[MP3]] and [[RealAudio]] format on the web.

== Reception ==

In 1990, Walter Goodman wrote an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' comparing FAIR and [[Accuracy in Media]] and stated that the two groups' &quot;criticism of television and the press is often provocative. But it is always tendentious&quot;, and that FAIR's &quot;target invariably is bias on the right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodman |first=Walter |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE6DA173AF934A25755C0A966958260 |title=TV VIEW; Let's Be Frank About Fairness And Accuracy â |publisher=New York Times |date=June 17, 1990 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions ==
FAIR has said that in the range of opinion discussed in the [[mass media]], the right side of a discussion is usually represented by a committed supporter of [[right-wing]] causes, while the left side is often represented by a [[centrist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=7&amp;issue_area_id=56 |title=FAIR website |publisher=Fair.org |date= |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable events ==

In May 2002, [[Jeff Cohen (media critic)|Jeff Cohen]], a FAIR founder, left the organization to work as a producer on [[Phil Donahue]]'s short-lived talk show on [[MSNBC]].

In October 2002, FAIR's Action Alert citing the underestimate of the size of a massive [[anti-Iraq War]] rally led to a [[National Public Radio]] apology to its listeners and a followup article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' that ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' suggested was written &quot;in response to many organized protest letters sent to the Times since the paper's weak, and inaccurate, initial article about the march on Sunday.&quot;

In February 2004, a FAIR Action Alert led [[ABC World News Tonight]] and the ''New York Times'' to expand their coverage of the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] to explain the legal ramifications of the issue.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

In 2006, FAIR criticized U.S. media coverage of [[Venezuela]]n President [[Hugo Chavez|Hugo ChÃ¡vez]], taking issue with the assertion that &quot;... Hugo ChÃ¡vez is an [[autocrat]] who has consolidated one-party rule&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rendall |first=Steve |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3009 |title=The Repeatedly Re-Elected Autocrat |publisher=Fair.org |date= |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; FAIR has frequently criticized media coverage of the ChÃ¡vez government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=18&amp;region_id=18 |title=Region: Venezuela |publisher=FAIR |date= |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3107 |title=Coup Co-Conspirators as Free-Speech Martyrs |publisher=Fair.org |date=April 11, 2002 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naureckas |first=Jim |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3049 |title=Inexplicable Tongue-Lashing |publisher=Fair.org |date=September 24, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rendall |first=Steve |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3022 |title=The Myth of the Muzzled Media |publisher=Fair.org |date= |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3046 |title=NYT Hypes Venezuelan Threat |publisher=Fair.org |date=February 25, 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, FAIR criticized American media for coverage that was too positive during [[Pope Benedict XVI|Pope Benedict]]'s visit to the United States, claiming that he got a &quot;pass on Church abuse history.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3351 FAIR.org]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter sent out by FAIR in 1993 included the erroneous claim that [[violence against women]] increased by 40% on Super Bowl Sundays.  FAIR later told the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' &quot;It should not have gone out in FAIR materials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_n16_v46/ai_15779200/pg_2 Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting executive director Jeff Cohen's excerpted letter]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
