[[Image:Fireboat John J Harvey 2.jpg|thumb|Fireboat John J. Harvey]]

The '''''John J. Harvey''''' is a [[fireboat]] formerly of the [[New York City Fire Department]] in [[New York City]], famed for returning to service following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fireboatorg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;harborheroes&quot; /&gt; She is among the most powerful fireboats ever built, capable of pumping up to 18,000 gallons of water a minute.

Launched in 1931, the ''John J. Harvey'' had a distinguished career in the [[FDNY]] until her retirement in 1994. She was named for marine fireman John J. Harvey, killed when a ship exploded during a fire. Among the marine fires at which she assisted were the [[Cunard Line]] pier fire in 1932, the burning of the ''[[SS Normandie|Normandie]]'' in 1942, the ammunition ship ''[[SS El Estero]]'' in 1943&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/ThiesenElEstero.pdf The El Estero Fire&lt;/ref&gt;, and the collision of the ''Alva Cape'' and ''Texaco Massachusetts'' [[oil tanker]]s in 1966.  Her official designation at the end of her career was ''Marine 2''.

The ''Harvey'' was sold, at auction, in 1999, to a private consortium of marine [[preservationist]]s determined to prevent her from being [[scrap]]ped.  In June 2000 she was added to the [[National Park Service]]'s [[National Register of Historic Places]].  Her current owners have thoroughly restored her, and host frequent free trips on the river.

==September 11, 2001==
The ''John J. Harvey'' had an unexpected [[encore (concert)|encore]]. During the attacks on the [[World Trade Center]] on [[September 11, 2001]], the boat's owners asked FDNY officials for permission to assist in evacuations from [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nps&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, firefighters had determined that the vast scale of destruction had damaged many fire mains, depriving fire crews of water. Officials radioed the ''Harvey'' to drop off her passengers as soon as possible and return to the disaster site to pump water, reactivating her official designation ''Marine 2''. Alongside two other FDNY fireboats, she pumped water at the site for 80 hours, until water mains were restored.&lt;ref name=&quot;powerandmotor&quot; /&gt; The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] gave the ''Harvey'' a special National Preservation Award to recognize this incident. The ''Harvey''{{'}}s story was the subject of a 2002 [[children's book]].
