'''Crystal Lynn Bowersox''' (born August 4, 1985) is an [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]] and [[actress]], who was the runner-up on the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''. Bowersox's debut album, ''[[Farmer's Daughter (album)|Farmer's Daughter]]'', was released on December 14, 2010 on the [[Jive Records]] label.

==Early life==
Bowersox and her [[fraternal twin|twin]] brother, Carl, were born in [[Ottawa County, Ohio|Elliston, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiTribune-04-28-10&quot;&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-28/entertainment/ct-live-0428-crystal-bowersox-2-20100428_1_bar-northwest-ohio-american-idyll American idyll]. [[Chicago Tribune]]. April 29, 2010. Retrieved May 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
She attended [[Oak Harbor High School (Ohio)|Oak Harbor High School]] in [[Oak Harbor, Ohio]], and later attended the [[Toledo School for the Arts]] in [[Toledo, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ChiTribune-04-28-10&quot;/&gt; Bowersox performed her first professional gig at the age of 10. She appeared at local bars in Toledo, most popularly Papa's Tavern, and The Village Idiot in [[Maumee, Ohio]]. At the age of 17, she moved to [[Chicago]] looking for opportunity. She most commonly played as a [[busker]] at several train stations, including the Washington and Lake Redline stops.  She frequented open mics, such as the Uncommon Ground Clark and Grace, and Devon locations. She also played extensively in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood. In 2006, the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs chose Bowersox to represent Chicago folk musicians in the [[Sister Cities]] program &quot;Experience Chicago&quot;, held in [[Birmingham|Birmingham, England]]. In 2007, Bowersox traveled internationally on an independent small cafe tour, including [[Memphis, Tennessee]], [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca, Mexico]], and [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul|Istanbul, Turkey]].

==''American Idol''==
Bowersox auditioned for ''American Idol'' in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. She sang &quot;[[Piece of My Heart]].&quot; Guest judge [[Shania Twain]] commented that she had a &quot;raw, natural talent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/entertainment/Bowersox+Idol+idolize/3056262/story.html |title= Bowersox an Idol to idolize |author= Alex Strachan |publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date= May 21, 2010 |accessdate= July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2010, Bowersox was hospitalized because of complications from diabetes, forcing a last minute switch in scheduling to give her extra time to recuperate. Bowersox confirmed the illness on the May 19, 2010 results show during an interview with host [[Ryan Seacrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cnmnewsnetwork.com/11618/crystal-bowersox-hospital-2010-american-idol-contestant-hospitalized-for-diabetes/ |title=Crystal Bowersox Hospital: 2010 American Idol Contestant Hospitalized for Diabetes? |author=Bella Horton |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/news/crystal-bowersox-s-american-idol-future-1004072425.story#/news/crystal-bowersox-s-american-idol-future-1004072425.story |title=Crystal Bowersox's 'American Idol' Future Uncertain |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men competed that day instead of the women. She sang the next day and impressed all of the judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/03/04/entertainment/main6264861.shtml |title=Crystal Bowersox Wows &quot;Idol&quot; Judges |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 4, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following week, her strong performance prompted [[Simon Cowell]] to state, &quot;Right now, you are the one everyone has to beat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1633573/20100309/story.jhtml |title=Crystal Bowersox's 'Give Me One Reason' Dominates 'American Idol' |author=James Montgomery |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Siobhan Magnus]]'s elimination from the top 6 of ''[[American Idol]]'', Bowersox became the last remaining female contestant in the competition.

Bowersox is the first female contestant to make it to the finale since [[Jordin Sparks]] won the title in 2007. She is also the first contestant in ''American Idol'' history to have one of their original songs played on the show, or at least during their hometown package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/05/22/american-idol-crystal-bowersox-lee-dewyze/ 'Idolatry': Breaking down the Crystal-Lee finale (and bidding adieu to Casey) on 'American Idol']. May 22, 2010. Retrieved May 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal's original song &quot;Holy Toledo&quot; was played on the May 19 Top 3 Results show as the background music for her homecoming package - when she returned to Toledo, Ohio and Elliston, Ohio the previous weekend - and segued into her live performance of the same song at &quot;Bowerstock&quot;.

During her time on ''Idol'', Bowersox dated Tony Kusian, but the couple broke up just hours before the ''Idol'' finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Crystal Bowersox and Boyfriend Split Before Idol Finale | publisher = People| date = 2010-05-27| url =http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20420919,00.html| accessdate = 2010-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the final performance day, in [[Simon Cowell]]'s final critique on ''American Idol'', he called her performance of &quot;[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]&quot; &quot;outstanding&quot; and by far,  &quot;the best performance and song of the night&quot;.

On May 26, Bowersox was named the runner-up to winner [[Lee DeWyze]]. She recently announced that after her ''Idol'' career, she wants to bring more awareness to the disease of diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/idolchatter/post/2010/05/crystal-bowersox-and-lee-dewyze-dish-on-judges-picks-why-viewers-should-vote-for-them/1/ |title=Crystal Bowersox and Lee DeWyze dish on judges' picks, why viewers should vote for them|date=May 20, 2010|work=USA Today|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&lt;small&gt;{{note|1|Note 1}} Due to the judges using their one save to save [[Michael Lynche]], the Top 9 remained intact for another week.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;{{note|2|Note 2}} Though Crystal Bowersox was the last contestant announced to be 'safe' and moving on to the Top 3, [[Ryan Seacrest]] stressed on the Top 4 Results Night that the 'safe' contestants would be announced &quot;in no particular order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_20368739.html 'American Idol' recap: Film Schooled]. May 13, 2010. Retrieved May 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the audience has no way of knowing which of the Top 3 was the second-lowest vote-getter that night after [[Michael Lynche]], who was eliminated.&lt;/small&gt;
*&lt;small&gt;{{note|3|Note 3}} Song selected by [[Ellen DeGeneres]].
&lt;/small&gt;

==Post-''Idol'' career==
On May 27, 2010, one day after Bowersox's second place ''Idol'' finish, it was announced that she had signed with [[Simon Fuller]]'s [[19 Entertainment]] and with [[Jive Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/television/29arts-AMERICANIDOL_BRF.html?ref=todayspaper/ âAmerican Idolâ Finalists Sign Record Deals] May 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Her single &quot;[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]&quot; has since been released to radio stations and iTunes.

Bowersox and musician Brian Walker were married on October 10, 2010, at Uncommon Ground CafÃ© in Chicago, the restaurant where the couple had met six years earlier while both performing at Open Mic Night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Crystal Bowersox Gets Married! | publisher = People| date = 2010-10-10| url =http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20433323,00.html| accessdate = 2010-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowersox's debut album ''[[Farmer's Daughter (album)|Farmer's Daughter]]'' was released to stores and iTunes on December 14, 2010.  Bowersox performed her single &quot;[[Farmer's Daughter (Crystal Bowersox song)|Farmer's Daughter]]&quot; on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' on December 16, 2010.

On October 7, [[RCA Music Group]] announced it was disbanding [[Jive Records]] along with [[Arista Records]] and [[J Records]].  With the shutdown, all other artists previously signed to these three labels would see their future material released under the [[RCA Records]] brand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-new-executive-team-named-under-ceo-1005324782.story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2268707&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bowersox was not one of the artists who made the move, and was instead left without a record label.

She also made her acting debut on episode [[Dana Delany]]'s series ''[[Body of Proof]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvline.com/2011/10/crystal-bowersox-body-of-proof-preview-season-2-episode-6/ Crystal Bowersox Previews Body of Proof Role: 'I Felt Pretty Guilty When I Was Being Interrogated']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Idol-Crystal-Bowersox-Body-Proof-1038986.aspx?rss=breakingnews&amp;partnerid=imdb&amp;profileid=01 Crystal Bowersox Makes Her Acting Debut on Body of Proof: &quot;I Was Pretty Insecure&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
