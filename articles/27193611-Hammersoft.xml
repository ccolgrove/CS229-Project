The '''Ä°zmir Basmane Terminal''' ({{lang-tr|Basmane GarÄ±}}) is one of the two main railway stations in [[Ä°zmir]], the other being [[Ä°zmir Alsancak Terminal|Alsancak]]. The station is serviced by regional train service going to [[Nazilli]], [[AydÄ±n]], [[ÃdemiÅ]], [[Tire]] and [[SÃ¶ke]]. 

==History==
When the [[Oriental Railway Company]] built Alsancak Terminal, the demand for more railways in Ä°zmir grew. On July 4, 1863, the [[Smyrne Cassaba &amp; Prolongements|Smyrna Cassaba Railway]] (SCR) was chartered to build a line from Ä°mir to [[Turgutlu]] (then Cassaba). The railway chose to have their terminal close to the city center. Construction of the station began in 1864 and completed in 1866. The station opened on October 25, 1866. The SCR used the station for passenger and freight operations, with a freight depot in the back of the station. During [[World War I]], the station along with the railway was put under Ottoman military control. After the war and the [[Republic of Turkey]] formed, the station was still under SCR control until 1934, when the [[Turkish State Railways]] (TCDD) absorbed the SCR. TCDD continues to operate the station to the present. In 2001 the tracks were electrified, but never used. In 2006 the station was renovated and closed to passenger service. In 2009 passenger service returned.
