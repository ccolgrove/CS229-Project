'''OtherOS''' was a feature available in early versions of the [[PlayStation 3]] [[video game console]] that allowed other operating systems, such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], to be installed on the system. This feature was made unavailable in newer models and removed from the oldest ones through a [[firmware]] update by [[Sony]].

The &quot;Other OS&quot; feature is disabled by firmware version 3.21 but still runs on older consoles that have firmware 3.15 or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/03/28/ps3-firmware-v3-21-update |title=PS3 Firmware (v3.21) Update |author= Patrick Seybold |date=28 March 2010 |publisher= PlayStation.Blog |accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on March 30, 2010 [[George Hotz]] (aka GeoHot) stated his intention to create a custom firmware for the PS3 to counter this move,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geohotps3.blogspot.com/2010/03/dont-update.html|title=On the Playstation 3: Don't Update|author=George Hotz|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/03/hacker-vows-to-fight-sony-ps3-update-restore-linux-support.ars |title=Hacker vows to fight Sony PS3 update, restore Linux support |author= Ben Kuchera |date=30 March 2010 |publisher= ArsTechnica |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; warning gamers not to update their systems until he finds a way to keep the OtherOS option on the PlayStation 3.  Hotz in July 2010 left the PlayStation 3 hacking and iPhone jailbreaking scene. He made his blog (both iPhone and PS3) invite-only and deleted his Twitter account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ihackintosh.com/2010/07/geohot-closes-twitter-account-and-blog/ |title=Geohot Closes Twitter Account and Blog |date=13 July 2010 |publisher= iHackintosh |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a [[class action lawsuit]] has been filed against Sony for those who wish to pursue legal remedies (see [[PlayStation 3 system software]]).

Any [[Linux]] operating system had access to &lt;!--***DO NOT CHANGE these numbers without a reference***--&gt; 6 of the 7 [[Cell (microprocessor)#Synergistic Processing Elements (SPE)|Synergistic Processing Element]]s;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.ps3source.net/content/view/17/33/ SPE Access]&lt;/ref&gt; Sony implemented a [[hypervisor]] restricting access from the [[RSX 'Reality Synthesizer'|RSX]]. [[IBM]] provided an introduction to programming [[parallel computing|parallel]] applications on the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-linuxps3-1/index.html?S_TACT=105AGX16&amp;S_CMP=EDU IBM's introduction to programming parallel applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since 2000, Sony has used the fact that the [[PlayStation 2]] can run [[Linux]] in its marketing.  They promoted the release of the [[Linux for PlayStation 2|PS2 Linux Kit]], which included a Linux-based operating system, a [[USB]] keyboard and mouse, a [[VGA]] adapter, a PlayStation 2 [[Ethernet]] network adapter, and a 40 [[gigabyte|GB]] [[hard disk drive]] (HDD).

The [[PlayStation 3]] does not have Linux pre-installed. However, Sony included an option in the [[Cross Media Bar|XMB]] menu soon after the [[PlayStation 3]] launched that allowed booting into Linux from the hard drive or from a [[Live CD]] that the distributor's [[Linux kernel|kernel]] would boot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/osinstall.html PlayStation Manual (How to)]&lt;/ref&gt; Sony stated, &quot;It was fully intended that you, a PS3 owner, could play games, watch movies, view photos, listen to music, and run a full-featured Linux operating system that transforms your PS3 into a home computer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6162316.html?tag=result;title;0 | title=Yellow Dog Linux launches for PS3|accessdate=2007-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sony announced the upcoming release of the PS3 Slim in September 2009, they stated that it would not be supporting the OtherOS feature, without offering any explanation for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scee.presscentre.com/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=4842&amp;NewsAreaID=2 | title=SCEE PS3 Slim press release|accessdate=2009-08-18}}{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 Sony announced that the &quot;Other OS&quot; capability of the original PS3 models would be removed due to security concerns in PS3 Firmware 3.21 on [[April 1]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/03/29/ps3-firmware-3-21-coming-april-1st/ | title=PS3 Firmware 3.21 Coming April 1st|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods of bypassing the updating and retaining the ability to sign into PSN have been discovered, most of which involve using third party DNS servers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3004.pokemonger.com/showthread.php?tid=21]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Hotz|Geohot]] claims to have created custom firmware for the PS3 called 3.21OO that re-enables OtherOS and has published a video of his Custom Firmware as proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://geohotps3.blogspot.com/2010/04/otheros-supported-on-321oo.html | title=OtherOS Supported on &quot;3.21OO&quot; | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the release of a YouTube video which apparently demonstrates the use of his custom firmware, the length of time it has taken for a release date to be announced has convinced some in the online community that this custom firmware was in fact a hoax.

On April 27, 2010 a class action lawsuit was filed in California. The lawsuit claimed that the removal of the OtherOS feature was &quot;unfair and deceptive&quot; and a &quot;breach of good faith&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://ia331218.us.archive.org/2/items/gov.uscourts.cand.226894/gov.uscourts.cand.226894.1.0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the filing relates to violation of various [[consumer protection]] laws relating to the removal. Several other lawsuits were also filed and are somewhat similar in nature but are filed by other individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sony Sued Again For Removing PS3 Linux Feature&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sony Sued Again For Removing PS3 Linux Feature| publisher = IGN = 2010-05-07| url = http://ps3.ign.com/articles/108/1088481p1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2010, Geohot announced that he would not bring out his custom firmware to the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ps3-hacks.com/2010/07/14/geohot-bids-farewell-no-3-21oo-for-you/ | title=Geohot Bids Farewell; No 3.21OO For You! | accessdate=2010-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, [[Sony]] sued [[Geohot]] and members of fail0verflow for their [[jailbreaking]] of the PS3.  Charges included violating the [[Digital Millenium Copyright Act|DMCA]], [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act|CFAA]], [[Contributory_liability| Copyright law]], and [[California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act|California's CCDAFA]], and for [[Breach of Contract]] (related to the [[PlayStation Network]] [[Terms of service|User Agreement]]), [[Tortious interference]], [[Misappropriation]], and [[Tresspass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engadget.com/2011/01/12/sony-follows-up-officially-sues-geohot-and-fail0verflow-over-ps/ Sony follows up, officially sues Geohot and fail0verflow over PS3 jailbreak].

On May 4th, 2011, Youness Alaoui from the PS3MFW team announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitter.com/#!/KaKaRoToKS/status/65680872422117376 Tweet] from Youness Alaoui&lt;/ref&gt; the release of a modified PS3 firmware that allows running OtherOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://ps3mfw.com/?p=481|title=OtherOS Is Back!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gitbrew.org/otheros/ OtherOS++] at gitbrew.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/05/with-psn-still-down-hackers-return-linux-to-the-playstation-3.ars|title=With PSN still down, hackers return Linux to the PlayStation 3|author=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linux kernel==
[[Linux (kernel)|Linux]] supported [[PlayStation 3]] with version 2.6.21. No patches or modifications are required.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/geoff/ps3-linux.git;a=summary The latest source for the PS3 kernel]{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple Linux add-on CD for the PS3 includes support for [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]] 8 and other [[operating systems]] that already claim to install natively on the PS3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxforps3.org/ Linux add-on CD for PS3]{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is currently an issue with the latest kboot{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} boot loader provided by [[kernel.org]]. Once the user selects the default action, the USB ports are de-registered on some systems. A [[work-around]] is available at [[PSUbuntu]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Distributions==
[[Debian]], [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]] 8, [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], [[OpenSUSE]] (10.3 to 11.1) , and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] run on the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.keshi.org/moin/moin.cgi/PS3/Debian/Live |title=Debian|Live for PS3|accessdate=2007-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.ps3coderz.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=119&amp;Itemid=54 | title=PlayStation 3 Spin | accessdate=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whitesanjuro.googlepages.com Gentoo]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Ubuntu===
Some versions of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] up to the release 10.10 have been [[ported]] to the PS3 platform.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PlayStation_3 help.ubuntu.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The installer cannot run in Live mode when running in [[480i]] or [[480p]] video resolutions, but it offers a text-based installer that installs fully functional Ubuntu. It is possible to mount an external USB hard drive as the home folder during install.

The LTS release 8.04 (Hardy Heron) of Ubuntu is incompatible with the PS3. However the 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) release was ported to the PS3 on the same release date as the official main Ubuntu release.&lt;ref name=&quot;mainubuntups3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psubuntu.com/2008/10/30/intrepid-ibex-released/ |title=Intrepid Ibex released |accessdate=2008-10-30 |publisher=PsUbuntu |date=2008-10-30 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yellow Dog Linux===
[[Yellow Dog Linux]] 5.0 was one of the first Linux distributions to run on [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://ps3.ign.com/articles/748/748255p1.html IGN: Yellow Dog Linux 5.0 Hands-on&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed specifically for HDTV so users with SDTV will have to use the commands 'installtext' and 'ydl480i' to install and run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/news/2006/2006-10-17.shtml terrasoftsolutions.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yellow Dog Linux is based on the [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]]/[[CentOS]] core and relies on the [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] package manager. Digital audio has been verified to function properly, however, the [[Nvidia]] [[graphics card]] is not supported beyond [[framebuffer]] mode. In addition, some other hardware components will not function properly without modifications to the kernel. [[WiFi]] functionality via the Network Manager is also not fully supported and must be entered manually via the Network Configuration tool, or in some cases, through the command shell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrasoftsolutions.com/support/hardware/sony-ps3.shtml Yellow Dog Linux 6.x Hardware Support Page]&lt;/ref&gt; A workaround is available to enable wireless to be configured via the Network Manager.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yellowdog-board.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;t=4416#p22368&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Removed stuff not obviously related to PS3 support. If more of this is generic info about YDL, it should also go.--&gt;

===OpenSUSE===
[[OpenSUSE]] 10.3 was the first version of OpenSUSE to run on the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 3]] platform. OpenSUSE is a free version of [[SUSE Linux]], which is owned by [[Novell]]. There are PlayStation 3 specific installation instructions available for OpenSUSE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.opensuse.org/PS3 en.opensuse.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with OpenSUSE 11.2, support for the [[PowerPC]] (and therefore the PlayStation 3) has been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://en.opensuse.org/POWER%40SUSE en.opensuse.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fedora===
[[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] also ran on the [[PlayStation 3]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxforps3.org |title=CECHExx PS3 with firmware 2.01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fedora 7 works on a USB external hard disk but fails to detect the internal disk, Fedora9 detects the internal disk but not the USB disk, Fedora8 will not work due to video &quot;card&quot; detection problems. Fedora 10 installs on the internal hard disk without any issues and works fine without having to change any settings.

Fedora 12 only installs on the PlayStation 3 when running the 64 bit kernel and only when English is the chosen language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philipotoole.com/fedora-12-on-the-ps3 |title=Installing FC12 on an 80GB PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RSX Homebrew==
Linux on the PlayStation 3 allows for a range of [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] programs to be developed. Although the [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell's]] performance is more than enough to handle most media requirements or render complex [[3D graphics]], it does lack the [[FLOPS|teraflops]] performance of a contemporary [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]'s texture fetching hardware. For this reason many complex games aren't possible on the PlayStation 3 through Linux, as access to hardware acceleration in the [[RSX 'Reality Synthesizer'|RSX]] is restricted by a [[hypervisor]].

There have been developments in enabling access to the RSX through the [[Linux kernel]] and the [[X Window System]].&lt;ref&gt;
[http://wiki.ps2dev.org/ps3:rsx ps3:rsx wiki.ps2dev.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It's possible to use the RSX memory as swap space. A trick to access some 3D functions was blocked with firmware 2.10.

==AsbestOS==

Reverse engineering advancements focused around a recently discovered USB descriptor parsing vulnerability in 3.41 firmware, which allowed running the Linux kernel on 3.41 firmware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://marcansoft.com/blog/2010/10/asbestos-running-linux-as-gameos/ | title=AsbestOS - running linux as gameos | accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://lwn.net/Articles/410773/ | title=LWN - AsbestOS news entry | accessdate=2010-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of the project is the ability to load the Linux kernel via TFTP and run it with access to all 7 [[Cell (microprocessor)#Synergistic Processing Elements (SPE)|SPE]]'s (requires applying a small patch to the kernel). The rest of the system can run off an NFS share - hard disk access is currently not implemented, as well as some other features.

Also, since the exploit runs the kernel with game privileges, graphics acceleration is now available, although it requires reworking of the [[nouveau (graphics)|nouveau]] driver code. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==FreeBSD==

Support for PlayStation 3 was added to [[FreeBSD]] 9.0 in summer 2010. This support is limited only to network-booting the machine on machines with firmware version 3.15 and OtherOS functionality still intact.
