Chinese Americans constitute one group of [[overseas Chinese]] and also a subgroup of [[East Asia]]n Americans, which is further a subgroup of [[Asian American]]s.  Within this community, the term Chinese American is often broadly defined to include not only immigrants from [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]], and their descendants but also immigrants and descendants of overseas Chinese people who migrated to the United States from places as diverse as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and other countries in [[southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Taiwanese Americans|first=Franklin|last=Ng|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=9780313297625|page=2, 118, 126|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese American community is the largest ethnic group of Asian Americans, consisting of 22.4% of the Asian American population.

[[File:Chinese railroad workers sierra nevada.jpg|right|thumb|[[China|Chinese]] railroad workers in the snow greet a train â 19th century]]

The first Chinese immigrants arrived in 1820 according to U.S. government records. 325 men are known to have arrived before the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]]&lt;ref&gt;Bill Bryson, Made In America,page 154&lt;/ref&gt; which drew the first significant number of laborers from China who mined for gold and performed menial labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strangers28&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Strangers From a Different Shore|author=Ronald Takaki|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|year=1998|isbn=0316831093|page=28|authorlink=Ronald Takaki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chang34-35&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Chinese in America]]|author=Iris Chang|year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=0670031232|pages=34â35|authorlink=Iris Chang}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kwong44&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese America|author=Peter Kwong and Dusanka Miscevic|publisher=[[The New Press]]|year=2005|isbn=1565849620|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 25,000 immigrants by 1852, and 105,465 by 1880, most of whom lived on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. They formed over a tenth of California's population. Nearly all the early immigrants were young males with low educational levels from six districts in the [[Guangdong]] province.&lt;ref name=historyworld&gt;International World History Project. [http://history-world.org/asian_americans.htm Asian Americans].  Accessed 2007-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Chinese faced [[racial discrimination]] in the form of [[anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States|anti-Chinese sentiment]] and [[Anti-Chinese legislation in the United States|legislation]], and Chinese people were banned from immigrating between 1885 and 1943, when the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] was in effect. Since the repeal of the Act in 1943, immigration of Chinese continued to be heavily restricted until 1965.  During the 1970s, the vast majority of ethnic Chinese immigration into the United States was from [[Hong Kong]], followed by [[Taiwan]], with relatively few immigrants coming from [[mainland China]]. During the 1980s, in part due to the liberalization of emigration restrictions in the mid-1970s, immigrants from [[mainland China]] formed a larger proportion of ethnic Chinese immigrating to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, Department of Homeland Security:2007 - Table 2 - Persons Obtaining Legal Permanent Resident Status by Region and Selected Country of Last Residence: Fiscal Years 1820 to 2007 - http://www.dhs.gov/ximgtn/statistics/publications/yearbook.shtm&lt;/ref&gt;  Cantonese, historically the language of most Chinese immigrants, is the third most widely spoken non-English language in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lai&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lai | first = H.

==Demographics==
{{seealso|Demographics of the United States}}
[[File:Census Bureau 2000, Chinese in the United States.png|thumb|right|450px]]
{{see|List of U.S. cities with large Chinese American populations}}
According to the 2009 American Community Survey, the three [[Metropolitan Statistical Area|metropolitan areas]] with the largest Chinese American populations were the [[Greater New York]] [[Combined Statistical Area]] at about 666,000 people, the [[San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland]] Combined Statistical Area at about 562,000 people, and the [[Greater Los Angeles area|Greater Los Angeles]] Combined Statistical Area at about 495,000 people. [[New York City]] is home to the highest Chinese American population of any city proper (486,463), while the Los Angeles County city of [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]] has the highest percentage of Chinese Americans of any municipality, at 43.7% of its population, or 24,758 people. 

The ten states with the largest estimated Chinese American populations, according to both the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], were [[California]] (1,253,100; 3.4%), [[New York State|New York]] (577,000; 3.0%), [[Texas]] (157,000; 0.6%), [[New Jersey]] (134,500; 1.5%), [[Massachusetts]] (123,000; 1.9%), [[Illinois]] (104,200; 0.8%), [[Washington state|Washington]] (94,200; 1.4%), [[Pennsylvania]] (85,000; 0.7%), [[Maryland]] (69,400; 1.2%), and [[Virginia]] (59,800; 0.7%). The state of [[Hawaii]] has the highest concentration of Chinese Americans at 4.0%, or 55,000 people. 

The [[New York City Metropolitan Area]], consisting of [[New York City]], [[Long Island]], and nearby areas within the states of [[New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], and [[Pennsylvania]], is home to the largest Chinese American population of any [[U.S. metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] within the United States, enumerating 665,714 individuals as of the 2009 American Community Survey Census statistical data,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=adp&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_DP5&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-tree_id=308&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-_caller=geoselect&amp;-geo_id=33000US408&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en|chapter=New York-Newark-Bridgeport, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area |title=American Community Survey|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|year=2009|accessdate=2010-10-01|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and including at least seven [[Chinatown]]s. Continuing [[Chinese emigration|immigration from Mainland China]], both legal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhs.gov/files/statistics/publications/LPR10.shtm|title=Yearbook of Immigration Statistics: 2010 Supplemental Table 2|publisher=U.S. Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and illegal in origin, has spurred the ongoing rise of the Chinese American population in the New York metropolitan area; this immigration continues to be fueled by New York's status as an alpha global city, its high population density, its extensive mass transit system, and the New York metropolitan area's enormous economic marketplace.

[[San Francisco]], California has the highest [[per capita]] concentration of Chinese Americans of any major city in the United States, at an estimated 19.8%, or 157,747 people, and contains the second-largest total number of Chinese Americans of any U.S. city. San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] was established in the 1840s, making it the oldest Chinatown in [[North America]] and the largest neighborhood of Chinese people outside of [[Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.chinatownology.com/usa.html www.Chinatownology.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.community.ups.com/Community/Community+Internship+Program/San+Francisco United Parcel Service Community Site]&lt;/ref&gt; composed in large part by immigrants hailing from [[Guangdong province]] and also many from [[Hong Kong]]. The San Francisco neighborhoods of [[Sunset District]] and [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Richmond District]] also contain significant Chinese populations. 

Other metropolitan areas with large Chinese American populations include [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[Washington, D.C.]],  [[Houston, Texas|Houston]],  [[Seattle]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Dallas]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[San Diego]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]].  

In these cities, there are often multiple Chinatowns, an older one and a newer one which is populated by immigrants from the 1960s and 1970s. In some areas, Chinese Americans maintain close relationships with other Asian groups (i.e. [[Koreans]], [[Filipinos]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] and so on). 

New York City's [[Lower East Side]], San Francisco's [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] and Los Angeles' [[Olvera Street]] are good examples of Chinese-Americans intermingled with other races and cultures.

In addition to the big cities, smaller pockets of Chinese Americans are also dispersed in rural towns, often university-college towns, throughout the United States. For example, the number of Chinese Americans, including college professors, doctors, professionals, and students, has increased over 200% from 2005 to 2010 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], a small city with a large number of colleges.

Income and social status of these Chinese-American locations vary widely. Although many Chinese Americans in [[Chinatowns]] of large cities are often members of an impoverished working class, others are well-educated upper-class people living in affluent suburbs. The upper and lower-class Chinese are also widely separated by social status and class discrimination. In California's [[San Gabriel Valley]], for example, the cities of [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]] and [[San Marino, California|San Marino]] are both Chinese American communities lying geographically close to each other but they are separated by a large socio-economic and income gap.

==Influence on American culture==

[[Image:Steven Chu official DOE portrait.jpg|thumb|Secretary of Energy [[Steven Chu]] is among the several Chinese Americans to have won the [[Nobel Prize]]. The others are [[Tsung-dao Lee]], [[Samuel C. C. Ting]], [[Daniel Chee Tsui]], [[Chen Ning Yang]], [[Roger Y. Tsien]] and [[Charles K. Kao]].]]
Some of the noteworthy Chinese contributions include building Western half of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental railroad]] and levees in the [[Sacramento River Delta]]; the popularization of [[American Chinese cuisine|Chinese American food]]; technological innovation and entrepreneurship; and the introduction of Chinese and [[East Asian]] culture to America, such as [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Kung fu]].

Chinese immigrants to the United States brought many of their ideas, ideals and values with them.  Some of these have continued to influence later generations.  Among them is [[Confucianism|Confucian]] respect for elders and filial piety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu&quot;&gt;Haiming Liu (2005) &quot;Asian-American Ideas (Cultural Migration)&quot; ''In'' Horowitz, Maryanne Cline  (editor) (2005) ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'' Charles Scribner's Sons, Detroit, Michigan, volume 1, pp. 158-160, ISBN 0-684-31377-4&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly education and the civil service were the most important path for upward social mobility in China.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semple, Kirk (21 August 2008) [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E4DA113AF932A1575BC0A96E9C8B63 &quot;Among Chinese-Americans, a Split on Sports&quot;] ''The New York Times'' page B-2&lt;/ref&gt;  The first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show about Asian Americans was ''[[Flower Drum Song]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berson, Misha.

Retrieved November 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In most American cities with Chinese populations, the new year is celebrated with cultural festivals and parties.  In [[Seattle]], the [[FestÃ¡l#China: Chinese Culture and Arts Festival|Chinese Culture and Arts Festival]] is held every year.  Other important festivals include the [[Dragon Boat Festival]] and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]].

Analysis indicated that most non-Asian Americans do not differentiate between Chinese Americans and East Asian Americans generally, and perceptions of both groups are nearly identical.&lt;ref name=c100&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.committee100.org/media/media_eng/042501.html |author=Committee of 100 |title=Committee of 100 Announces Results of Landmark National Survey on American Attitudes towards Chinese Americans and Asian Americans  |date=2001-04-25 |accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2001 survey of Americans' attitudes toward Asian Americans and Chinese Americans indicated that one fourth of the respondents had somewhat or very negative attitude toward Chinese Americans in general.&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/04/27/MN199998.DTL |author=Matthew Yi, et al. |title=Asian Americans seen negatively |accessdate=2007-06-14 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study did find several positive perceptions of Chinese Americans: strong family values (91%); honesty as business people (77%); high value on education (67%).&lt;ref name=c100/&gt;

[[Image:ChinAmerKids,1936.jpg|thumb|Chinese American children waving from a bus at a picnic in Los Angeles, 1936]]

==Citizenship==
Legally all ethnic Chinese born in the United States are American citizens as a result of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and the 1898 [[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]] Supreme Court decision. Upon naturalization, immigrants to the United States must take an oath of loyalty to the United States but are not required to formally renounce their former citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html U.S. State Department]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the [[People's Republic of China]] does not recognize dual citizenship and considers the naturalization of a person as an American citizen to imply a renunciation of PRC citizenship.  On the other hand, the [[Republic of China]] does not view naturalization in other countries as an automatic renunciation of [[Nationality Law of the Republic of China|Chinese nationality]].

===Language===
[[Chinese language|Chinese]], mostly of the [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese variety]], is the third most-spoken language in the United States, almost completely spoken within Chinese American populations and by immigrants or the descendants of immigrants, especially in [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lai&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Lai | first = H. Mark | title = Becoming Chinese American: A History of Communities and Institutions | publisher = AltaMira Press | year = 2004 | isbn = 0759104581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 2 million Americans speak [[identification of the varieties of Chinese|some variety of Chinese]], with [[Standard Chinese]] becoming increasingly more common due to immigration from mainland China and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lai&quot;/&gt;

In [[New York City]] at least, although [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] is spoken as a native language among only ten percent of Chinese speakers, it is used as a secondary dialect among the greatest number of them and is on its way to replace Cantonese as their [[lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = GarcÃ­a | first = Ofelia | coauthors = Fishman, Joshua A. | title = The Multilingual Apple: Languages in New York City | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2002 | isbn = 311017281X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the immigration from [[Fujian]] is creating an increasingly large number of [[Min]] speakers. [[Wu Chinese]], a Chinese language previously unheard of in the United States, is now spoken by a minority of recent Chinese immigrants, who hail from [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]], and [[Shanghai]].

Although Chinese Americans grow up learning [[English language|English]], some teach their children Chinese for a variety of reasons: preservation of an ancient civilization, preservation of a unique identity, pride in their cultural ancestry, desire for easy communication with them and other relatives, and the perception that Chinese will be a very useful language as China's economic strength increases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Politics==
[[File:Elaine_Chao_large.jpg|thumb|[[Elaine Chao]] was the first Chinese American member of a President's Cabinet, having served from 2001â2009 as [[Secretary of Labor]] under President [[George W. Bush]].]]
[[File:Gary Locke official portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Gary Locke]] is the only Chinese American to have served as a state governor (for [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]). He is also the first Chinese American Commerce Secretary, serving in [[Barack Obama]]'s administration.]]

Chinese Americans are divided among many subgroups based on factors such as a generation, place of origin, socio-economic level, and do not have uniform attitudes about the [[People's Republic of China]], the [[Republic of China]], the [[United States]], or [[Chinese nationalism]], with attitudes varying widely between active support, hostility, or indifference.  Different subgroups of Chinese Americans also have radically different and sometimes very conflicting political priorities and goals.  It is for this reason that Chinese Americans do not have any{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} unified political groups or any unified political viewpoints.

In the days leading up to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. Presidential Election]], [[John Kerry]] was favored by 58% of Chinese Americans, with [[George W. Bush]] being favored by 23% of Chinese Americans and 19% undecided.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FI16Aa01.html|title=Asian-Americans lean toward Kerry|publisher=Asia Times|date=2004-09-16|accessdate=2007-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, many Chinese Americans have started pursuing careers in politics and succeeded in getting elected and/or appointed into political office. In particular, several prominent Chinese Americans have in recent years served as members of the President's cabinet and other federal offices.  [[Elaine Chao]] became the first Chinese American cabinet member in American history when she was appointed in 2001 to serve as [[Secretary of Labor]] under President [[George W. Bush]], a position she held until 2009; she also was the first female [[Asian American]] to serve in a cabinet post in American history.  In addition, [[Gary Locke (politician)|Gary Locke]] became the first Chinese American governor when he was elected to this position for the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].  He currently serves as [[Secretary of Commerce]].  [[Steven Chu]] became the first Chinese American [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]].  [[Judy Chu]] became the first Chinese American woman elected to Congress as the Representative for California's 32nd district on July 15, 2009.  Others include [[Mike Eng]], [[Hiram Fong]], [[Daniel Akaka]], [[March Fong Eu]], [[Matt Fong]], [[Thomas Tang]], [[Norman Bay]], [[Leland Yee]], [[John Liu]], [[Charles Djou]], [[David S. C. Chu]] and [[David Wu]]. 

During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Chinese Americans, like all [[overseas Chinese]], generally speaking, were viewed as [[capitalism|capitalist]] traitors by the [[People's Republic of China]] [[government]]. This attitude changed completely in the late 1970s with the reforms of [[Deng Xiaoping]].  Increasingly, Chinese Americans were seen as sources of business and technical expertise and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] who could aid in China's [[Economic development|economic]] and other [[International development|development]].
