'''SÃ¼dliche Petermann Range''' (also known as '''SÃ¶re Petermannkjeda''', and '''Gory Otto Grotevolya''') is one of the [[Petermann Ranges]], trending NE-SW for 22&amp;nbsp;mi from [[Svarthausane Crags]] to [[Gneiskopf Peak]], in the [[Wohlthat Mountains]], [[Queen Maud Land]]. [[Mount Neustruyev]] (also known as '''Gora Neustruyeva''') is a 2,900 meter peak standing 5&amp;nbsp;mi NNE of Gneiskopf Peak.

== Discovery and naming ==
SÃ¼dliche Petermann Range was discovered and plotted from air photos by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938-1939), led by Capt. [[Alfred Ritscher]], which gave directional names to the eastern, middle and western units of the Petermann Ranges. This range was named Sore Petermannkjeda by [[Sixth Norwegian Antarctic Expedition]], 1956-60, because of its southern position in association with other units in the Petermann Ranges. A German form of this name has been recommended by [[US-ACAN]] to agree with spellings adopted for the aforementioned ranges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/ USGS GNIS: SÃ¼dliche Petermann Range]&lt;/ref&gt;
