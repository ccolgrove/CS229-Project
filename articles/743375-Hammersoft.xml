'''Goshen College''', (also known as '''Goshen''' or '''GC''') is a private [[Mennonite]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[Goshen, Indiana]], USA with an enrollment of around 1,000 students.  The college is [[school accreditation|accredited]] by [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] and is a member of the [[Council for Christian Colleges and Universities]]. Goshen College was founded in 1894 as the Elkhart Institute, and is affiliated with [[Mennonite Church USA]]. Goshen College maintains a distinctive Christian Mennonite environment, but admits students regardless of race or religion.  [[U.S. News and World Reports]] ranks Goshen as a third-tier liberal arts college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=US News and World Reports|title=America's Best Colleges 2008: Goshen College: At a glance|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drglance_1799_brief.php|year=2008|accessdate=2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goshen is known for its Study-Service Term (SST), a program that takes students overseas for three months. Their time is split between studying the nation's language, history and culture, usually in the capital, and performing volunteer service, usually in smaller cities or rural areas of the country. The program was pioneering when it was founded in 1968 before study-abroad programs became widespread. The college also launched a domestic SST in 2010 to immerse students in the Latino culture and community in northern Indiana.

Goshen College is home to the [[Mennonite Quarterly Review]] and the [[Mennonite Historical Library]], a 68,000 volume library compiling the most comprehensive collection of [[Anabaptist]] material in the United States.

Goshen tends to maintain a fairly steady 55/45 ratio of women to men. Goshen's student percentage of Mennonite students to other affiliations also is approximately 55/45.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goshen.edu/aboutgc/diversity.php Diversity at Goshen College]. URL accessed on 2006-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The history of Goshen College is intertwined with that of the Mennonite experience in America. Because both histories have been so important to each other, it is necessary to explain Goshen's stories as related to larger American and Mennonite society.

Goshen College is the first Mennonite school of higher education in North America to confer a four-year degree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bethel College (Kansas)|Bethel College]] is older but did not originally grant four-year degrees. Bethel was incorporated in 1887 and opened at its present site in 1893.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Old&quot; Mennonites had traditionally been suspicious of higher education, but by the late 19th century, opinion started to change. Decades earlier, US mainline church denominations had started on a spree of founding colleges across America with hopes of developing well- trained clergy for their congregations. As more &quot;Old&quot; Mennonites sent their children to other Christian colleges, they realized that, without a college of their own, many of their youth would leave the church. Thus, prompted in part as a reaction to mainline Christianity, the &quot;Old&quot; Mennonites started the Elkhart Institute in [[Elkhart, Indiana]] in August 1894 to prepare Mennonite youth for college. Because of this vision, even though Goshen today is open to everyone, its historical relationship with the Mennonite Church has had a lasting impact that is still very visible: It is home to the ''[[Mennonite Quarterly Review]]'', [[Mennonite Historical Library]], [[Mennonite Church USA Archives]], including Mennonite Central Committee archives, offices of &quot;The Mennonite&quot; and numerous alumni connections with the broader Mennonite Church.

[[Image:MnF=postcard.jpg|thumb|260px|Goshen College in the early 1900s]]
H.A. Mumaw, a practicing physician, first led the small operation. In 1894, a group of 15 &quot;Old&quot; Mennonite ministers and laymen started a corporation that they named the Elkhart Institute association.&lt;ref&gt;Schlabach, Theron F: ''Peace, Faith, Nation: Mennonites and Amish in Nineteenth Century America'', page 300. Herald Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;  The first diploma was awarded in 1898. Lured by businessmen to relocate several miles away to [[Goshen, Indiana]], the Institute moved in September 1903 and added a junior college course list, renaming itself Goshen College. By 1906, the Mennonite Board of Education took control of the college, dissolving the Elkhart Institute Association. A complete college course was established in 1908 and the first Bachelor of Arts degrees were conferred in 1910. The college-prep academy program of Goshen College was discontinued in 1935. However, after 1910, most of Goshen's students were enrolled in college courses. From 1914 to 1919, partly out of response to its constituents, Goshen College attempted a &quot;School of Agriculture,&quot; which sought to prepare Mennonite young people to return to their rural communities. The hope was that such a program would spark a technological revolution among some of the farmers. Unfortunately the program was never a success and, after [[World War I]], the program was cut, five years after it began.

The school was closed during the 1923-1924 school year by the Mennonite Board of Education but reopened the following year. One of many factors in closing the college was denominational tension due to [[Liberal Christianity|modernist]] and [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Christian theologies of the 1920s and their impact on Mennonite theology at the school.&lt;ref&gt;Juhnke, James C: ''Vision, Doctrine, War: Mennonite Identity and Organization in America 1890-1930'', page 128. Herald Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this crisis, many of Goshen's faculty and dozens of students, angry with the Mennonite Board of Education's decision, relocated to [[Bluffton University|Bluffton College]]. As part of the larger ongoing reaction against liberalism through the early 20th century, [[Hesston College]] and [[Eastern Mennonite University|Eastern Mennonite School]] were formed among &quot;Old&quot; Mennonites, although staunch traditionalists realized that no higher education was particularly safe.

When the institution was reopened, it was marked by the new leadership of president S.C. Yoder and dean [[Harold S. Bender]], a man whose influence upon the &quot;Old&quot; Mennonites was significant for much of the 20th century. Bender carefully piloted the stormy waters of theology by stating that [[Mennonitism]] was not [[liberalism]]. Bender later went on to say that [[fundamentalism]] also contributed to problems with theology and created ''[[The Anabaptist Vision]]'', a &quot;third way&quot; that sought to spell out the direction for the future Mennonite Church. More than arguing doctrine, Bender and a younger group of intellectuals at Goshen College sought to shape the Mennonite faith that was more ideological than institutional. The goal was to articulate a faith that could stand the test of academic scrutiny in broader society while carefully upholding traditional beliefs of the church. Out of this ideology, Bender started the ''[[Mennonite Quarterly Review]]''. Throughout this time, Goshen remained the epicenter of &quot;Old&quot; Mennonite theology and higher education, and became known as the &quot;Goshen Historical Renaissance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Toews, Paul: ''Mennonites in American Society, 1930-1970: Modernity and the Persistence of Religious Community'', page 88. Herald Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Goshen College Gate Today.JPG|thumb|left|260px|Goshen College today]]
During the 1940s, Goshen was one of the [[Mennonite Central Committee|Mennonite Central Committee's]] key places to form a &quot;relief training school&quot; that helped to train volunteers for [[Civilian Public Service]], an alternative to [[conscription]]. Many Mennonites chose the civilian service alternative because of their beliefs regarding Biblical pacifism and nonresistance.

In 1980, Goshen College was granted care of [[Merry Lea Environmental Center|Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center]], a {{convert|1150|acre|km2|sing=on}} nature preserve that now offers Goshen's Master's degree in Environmental Science. In 1993, Harold and Wilma Good, longtime friends of the college, left their estate to Goshen. The estate was estimated at roughly $28 million, the majority in stock of the [[Smuckers|J.M. Smucker Company]]. Wilma was a daughter of the company's founder. The college sold the stock and added the funds to its endowment, more than doubling it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html|title= Mennonite college endowments lag behind|publisher=Mennonite Weekly Review|year=2006|accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928021020/http://www.mennoweekly.org/JUNE/06-19-06/ENDOWMENTS06-19.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campus experienced a building boom in the later half of the 1990s through the present, with an estimated $30 million in new or renovated structures on campus. This included the addition of the Roman Gingerich Recreation-Fitness Center, the Music Center, the Connector, and the renovation of all dormitories. The college is currently working on a new campus master plan and strategic plan that will define the college's priorities for the years ahead. Today, more than 20,000 Goshen College alumni have been counted, residing in more than 85 countries. The Goshen campus has flourished from less than {{convert|50|acre|m2}} to {{convert|135|acre|km2}} with 18 major buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goshen.edu/aboutgc/history.php|title=History of Goshen College|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=2008-03-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070926225641/http://www.goshen.edu/aboutgc/history.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study-Service Term===
[[Image:WartburgSST.JPG|thumbnail|left|Wartburg Castle from Germany SST 2007]]
Started in 1968, Goshen College's Study Service Term (SST) is a unique program. Goshen was one of the pioneers of colleges in offering programs abroad, due in part to its Mennonite heritage of missions and foreign service, particularly [[Mennonite Central Committee]]. International education is a requirement for all students at Goshen College. Approximately 70-80 percent of students complete the requirement by participating in SST. Students are required to spend one semester abroad in a country or complete an intercultural experience in the US. They study the language and culture for six weeks at a foreign university, then do service for the remaining six weeks. Service may include working at a hospital, nursing home, kindergarten, or missionary service. Goshen College students currently may visit [[Cambodia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[China]], [[Tanzania]], [[Peru]], [[Senegal]], and [[Egypt]]. Previous SST spots include  [[Dominican Republic]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Germany]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Belize]], [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Poland]], [[South Korea]], [[Indonesia]], [[Mali]], and [[Ivory Coast]]. Over 7,000 students and 230 faculty members have journeyed to 23 different countries as part of SST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goshen.edu/sst/|title=Study-Service Term â Learning and Serving Abroad|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
===Athletics===
[[Image:GoshenCollegeSpiritMark.jpg|thumb|right|Athletics logo]]
Goshen maintains a variety of varsity sports. Goshen is a member of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] and Indiana's [[Mid-Central College Conference]] (MCC), one of the NAIA's most competitive basketball leagues. Because Goshen is part of the NAIA, it is eligible to award [[athletic scholarship]]s. Men's sports include Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Golf, Soccer, Tennis, and Track &amp; Field. Women's sports are Basketball, Cross Country, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Track &amp; Field, and Volleyball. The college plans to add women's golf in the 2012-13 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goshen College To Add Womenâs Golf For 2012-13 Season|url=http://goleafs.net/2011/07/goshen-college-to-add-womens-golf-for-2012-13-season/|work=GoLeafs.net|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Intramural]]s are also an integral part of Goshen's campus. Throughout the year, students participate in Baseball, Soccer, Ping-Pong, Volleyball, Frisbee Football, Badminton, Softball, and Racquetball.  Rugball is a popular sport among Goshen students. Introduced to Goshen College by a student in 2001,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} the game is a combination of rugby, football, and soccer, and has gained popularity on several other campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goshen.edu/virtualgc/photoalbum/rugball/index.htm|title=Student playing Rugball|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=2008-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clubs and organizations===
[[Image:Beach volleyball @ Goshen.JPG|thumb|left|260px|Goshen College intramural volleyball]]
Goshen College has no official fraternities or sororities. This is due in part to the college's philosophy of inclusiveness and contributing to a sense of community. Regardless, many different types of clubs and organizations exist to help facilitate campus life.   Clubs that play a significant part in campus life include: Black Student Union (BSU), Latino Student Union (LSU), International Student Club (ISC), Advocates, GC Players, American Sign Language Club, Sons of Liberty, Nursing Student Association, Voices and Harmony, Arabic/Middle Eastern Club, Entrepreneurship Club, Midweek Faith, Social Work Action Association (SWAA), Goshen College Pole Cats Disck Golf Club (GCPCDHC), Art Club, Pre-Med Club, Goshen Student Women's Association (GSWA), PAX and Eco-PAX.

Campus Activities Council, or CAC, is the primary extracurricular organization on campus that hosts a variety of weekend activities and events. CAC is responsible for &quot;Kick Off,&quot; a talent show held at the beginning of each semester. CAC also hosts &quot;Hour After&quot; shows, where talented students on campus perform music, comedy, or dancing for the audience. Goshen has a vibrant extracurricular program, with many students and faculty being involved on campus.

===International Students ===

The International Students Club (ISC) hosts every year the âCoffeehouseâ, an event during which international students demonstrate their artistic talents.  Students are also given the opportunity, through Global Citizenship, to individually talk about their culture, and have it published by the Goshen College Newspaper.

===Media===
Goshen College has its own school newspaper, ''The Record'' and its own radio station, [[WGCS]], branded as 91.1FM The Globe. On March 12, 2011, The Globe was named the Best College Station in the Nation, winning first place at the 71st Annual Conference of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) in New York City.
Goshen College Television (GCTV) produces a bi-weekly news show, &quot;The Correspondent&quot;, which covers campus and community news. GCTV has also been involved in several larger projects, including the broadcast of the school's annual Festival of Carols on [[WNIT]]. In the summer of 2011, the Goshen College communication department launched FiveCore Media, a video production company aimed at providing services for both on-campus and off-campus clients.
Every year Goshen College publishes the Maple Leaf, the school's yearbook, created, designed and managed by students. The Maple Leaf gives a glimpse of the academic year and provides documentation of the school's history.
In 2006, four students, part of Soluz Films,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soluzfilms.com Soluz Films]&lt;/ref&gt; received a grant from the school's Peace and Justice Journalism program to make a documentary entitled ''Fuerza'', on immigration in the Goshen area.

===Nickname===

Goshen College athletic teams are known as the &quot;Maple Leafs,&quot; picked from the city of Goshen being referred to as &quot;The Maple City.&quot;

===Performing arts===
[[Image:Goshen College Music Center.JPG|thumb|250px|The Goshen College Music Center]]
Goshen College students have a variety of shows to attend in the Music Center's Sauder Concert Hall or Reith Recital Hall or the Umble Center, Goshen's theater. With the addition of the Music Center to campus, the college has offered a Performing Arts Series of nationally renowned artists from across the country. Previous guests include [[Nickel Creek]], [[Colm Wilkinson]], [[Chanticleer]], [[Canadian Brass]], [[Tokyo String Quartet]], and [[Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra]] with [[Wynton Marsalis]].

===Spiritual life===

Because Goshen is a Christian college, spirituality plays an important part of campus life. Although Goshen maintains that people of different faiths are welcome to the college, the school emphasizes [[Judeo-Christian]] values in regard to operation, justice, and teaching. All faculty members at the school are Christian, with at least eighty percent adhering to Mennonite convictions. The College holds convocations every Monday, and chapels every Friday, with occasional special events, such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Students are required to attend fourteen of these services per semester.

Goshen College operates a campus ministries team, headed by the campus pastor. The team includes an assistant campus minister and student leaders who help guide and plan spiritual life on campus for the school year. Activities include managing the network of Goshen's small groups, spiritual friendship, leading campus worship, and planning chapels. Campus worship night is a voluntary praise and reflection time held every Wednesday night. Students also hold a [[TaizÃ©]] prayer service once a month on Sunday nights at 9:00. Because service is an important aspect of Christian faith, volunteerism ties in with spiritual life on campus.

===Volunteerism===

Every September, Goshen College participates in an activity called Celebrate Service Day (CSD). Students team with professors and administrative faculty and go out into the larger Goshen community for a day of service. First year students go with their colloquium advisers, while other students go with their dormitory floor or small group. Aside from CSD, many students donate their time to work at local kindergartens, elementary schools, hospitals, and nursing homes.

==Campus facilities==

Goshen College has four [[Dormitory|dormitories]], apartment living, and several small group houses.  Outside the original quadrangle, Goshen's current campus has not been the result of a single master plan; rather the campus has evolved eclectically from building to building as the institution grew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&amp;d=p690 The Council of Independent Colleges: Historic Campus Architecture Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goshen.edu/studentlife/p2l_main.php Residence life]&lt;/ref&gt; Four-year residency was typical until the mid-1970s, when a growing student enrollment prompted school officials to forgo building new dormitories and allow upperclassmen to live off campus. In 2005, Goshen College announced its plan to return to four-year residency. With more students on campus, the school has spent over $10 million building and renovating dorms. 

The Roman Gingerich Recreation and Fitness Center is a $7 million facility constructed in 1994 with three full-sized basketball courts, four racquetball courts, a 200 meter indoor track, swimming pool,(for recreational swimming only) hot tub, climbing wall, and weight room. The fitness center is open to all students and staff, and is used by community members as well.

The $24 million Music Center, completed in October 2002, has become regionally renowned for its design and acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcmusiccenter.org/ Goshen College Music Center]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcmusiccenter.org/php/facility/about/construction.php Construction]&lt;/ref&gt; The Music Center consists of several main sections: Sauder Concert Hall, Rieth Recital Hall, the Art Gallery, and various classrooms, practice rooms and offices. Several highlights are a central recording studio, MIDI labs, and Opus 41, a 1600-pipe [[Tracker action|tracker]] [[pipe organ]], the first in the world with [[Well-Tempered Clavier|tempering]] based on alumnus Bradley Lehman's research of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Johann Sebastian Bach's]] notation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcmusiccenter.org/php/facility/special.features/organ.php Opus 41 Pipe Organ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The facility was designed by Mathes Brierre Architects (design architects), Schmidt Associates (architects of record), and TALASKE (acoustics and audio consultants).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcmusiccenter.org/php/facility/about/index.php Goshen College Music Center website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small Group Housing===

Small Group Housing (SGH) is an option for juniors and seniors on Goshen's campus. Started in the 1970s, SGH offers students the opportunity to live in a house arrangement, with common kitchen and living spaces. The purpose of SGH is for students to develop another living experience alternative to dormitory life. This same idea was carried out with the construction of the Apartments. Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant review all potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group must create a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict. Other factors considered in the application process include house cumulative GPA, extracurricular involvement, median age of the group, and personal faculty recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goshen.edu/studentlife/apply/SGH.php|title=Small Group Housing|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=2008-04-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houses are then rewarded to applying groups who exemplify high academic, moral, and volunteer efforts, based on objective and subjective review.

===Satellite facilities===

Goshen College maintains [[Merry Lea Environmental Center]] and a marine lab in Florida.

Other properties maintained by Goshen College include: Brunk's Cabin, a retreat property complete with a lit sledding hill in [[Cass County, Michigan]], Witmer Woods,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goshen.edu/bio/Woods/NewWoods.html Witmer Wood's Goshen College website]&lt;/ref&gt; a {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} arboretum with over 100 native Indiana species, and the adjacent property College Cabin (Reservoir Place),&lt;ref&gt;[http://puka.cs.waikato.ac.nz/cgi-bin/cic/library?a=d&amp;d=p696 College Cabin architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; used for special events, along the [[Elkhart River]] and [[millrace]].

==Core values==

In 2002 the college approved five [[Ideal (ethics)|core values]] that would become the vision of the college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goshen.edu/nca/NCAComposit.pdf Goshen College Self-study Report 2004-2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goshen.edu/aboutgc/values/ Core values]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.goshen.edu/aboutgc/mission.php|title= Mission, statement of purpose and affirmations|publisher=Goshen College|accessdate=2008-07-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; These five values continue to define the college's future. These values were selected by Goshen College's board of directors because they identify the college's understanding of what it means to be a disciple of Christ.

; Christ-centered: based on {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:11|47}}, this is the main value with which the college seeks to identify. The remaining four branch from this value.

; Passionate learners: Goshen College believes that its faith is supported and sustained by knowledge. As a center of learning, its goals are to educate and renew the minds of its students through a spirit of academic excellence. ({{bibleverse|II|Peter|1:5-8|47}})

; Servant leaders: In a world searching for future leaders, Goshen seeks to produce servant leaders, embodied by the example Jesus has shown. By following Christ's example, Goshen seeks to create a culture of joyful service. ({{bibleverse||Matthew|20:26-28|47}})

; Compassionate peacemakers: Goshen College embraces biblical [[shalom]], the peace that God intends to build for humanity. Goshen seeks to renounce the violent and oppressive powers of this world while living lives that are examples of God's peace. ({{bibleverse||Matthew|5:9|47}})

; Global citizens: Goshen College teaches its students to go forth into the world offering their talents and gifts.    Goshen seeks to respect the differences of others, while at the same time seeking common ground. ({{bibleverse|II|Corinthians|5:18-20|47}})

==Notable People Associated with Goshen College==
A number of famous people have either taught or attended Goshen Gollege throughout the years. Co-founder of Oregon's Bach Music Festival, numerous academics, award winning authors, the developer of the seedless [[watermelon]], and prestigious business leaders and musicians have all called Goshen their alma mater. Goshen's motto, &quot;Culture for Service&quot; is evident in many graduates and faculty. Thus, recognition of their contributions to society often supersede recognition of their names. Members of the rock band [[Lotus (rock band)|Lotus]] attended Goshen College. Below is a list of several important people who have been associated with the College.

==Center for Intercultural Teaching and Learning==
On October 25, 2006, Goshen College announced that it was the recipient of a $12.5 million [[Lilly Endowment|Lilly grant]] to create the Center for Intercultural Teaching and Learning (CITL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citl.goshen.edu|title= Center for Intercultural Teaching and Learning|accessdate=2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aquirre&gt;Aguirre, Richard: &quot;Access, Transformation &amp; Research&quot;, Bulletin: The magazine of Goshen College, Winter/Spring 2007, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this grant was to research challenges that come with changing demographics in rural towns with small colleges, hopefully putting Goshen College at the forefront of the study. Goshen received this money in part because of its heritage with SST, and priding itself on being a good &quot;global citizen,&quot; one of the school's core values. Goshen College's location in Elkhart County is optimal for such a study because of the community's large and rapidly growing Latino population (12.6 percent of the population in 2006).&lt;ref name=Aquirre/&gt; The grant also sought provide a venue for growing and retaining minority (particularly Latino) students. Despite growing minority populations, Indiana's minority enrollment in its colleges and universities has only increased two percent.&lt;ref name=Aquirre/&gt;
&lt;!--===Controversy===
Goshen has a long reputation for calling to attention campus issues and weaknesses. Because of this, Goshen's most prominent criticism comes from within its community of alumni, faculty and friends. Issues concerning the role of minority students on campus has arisen, as well as how to include these students in community. A portion the $12.5 million Lilly Endowment grant is currently being used to help resolve some of the campus's ongoing problems.

The most vocal controversy on campus in recent years has been concerning on-campus student housing, a move that was set in motion in 2002 for the class of 2008. Goshen College had started out as a residential college, but facing a housing crisis in the 1970s, opted to make four-year residency optional to seniors. In 2002, citing concern over the lack of senior leadership on campus and the growing disparity over sense of community, the college decided to reintroduce four-year living to the college. Other factors contributing to this decision was concern about student health and well-being from off-campus parties, as well as Goshen College's lackluster relationship with the Goshen-Elkhart community. Many students had been concerned about the added cost of living on campus four years, and to many it seemed it was simply another way for the college to boost revenues, as well as a clamping-down of freedom. Regardless, the Goshen's decision to become a residential college has produced The Apartments, of which Phase 2 will be completed in December 2007.

Recently there has been controversy surrounding the way that small group housing units have been assigned. Several students have raised concerns with the subjectivity and the potentially biased opinions of those deciding who will be awarded a house. Students have expressed these opinions in the form of newspaper articles, forums, conversations with faculty, etc. One recent article in the school news publication expressed the concerns of 11 students who were put into a housing unit that had a listed capacity of 10, while the 12 person-capacity housing unit that was available was given to a group of 8 current students. They also expressed their frustration with the fact that they were not allowed to see the reasons why they had not been given a house, which was a main desire of students at housing forums at the beginning of the year.--&gt;

==Traditions==
* Goshen's motto, &quot;Culture for Service,&quot; was coined by president Noah E. Byers in 1903.

* Goshen's school colors, purple and white, were modeled after [[Northwestern University]], where President Byers attended and after which he wanted to model Goshen.

* One of the college's many traditions is &quot;sampling&quot; sap from the city of Goshen's official Maple Tree, located on campus, and &quot;testing&quot; how many more weeks of winter there will be. Professors from the science department bring out their equipment with much fanfare to determine the official length of winter. In 2006, the maple tree was removed because of disease rotting the hardwood and was replaced by a new tree, now the official maple tree of Goshen. In 2007, new president Jim Brenneman replaced this tradition (which probably resulted in the early death of the maple) with &quot;Weather or Not Day&quot;; a day celebrating Northern Indiana's fickle weather.

* Early (1925) advertisements for the college were refreshingly direct. One said âGoshen [is] not the best college in the United States. But it is better than the rest for Mennonite young people.â&lt;ref&gt;Showalter, Shirley: President's Public Diaries. http://www.collegevalues.org/diaries.cfm?id=233&amp;a=1&lt;/ref&gt;
