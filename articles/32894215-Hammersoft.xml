Beaux-Arts (''Fine arts'') is the largest station in the [[Charleroi Metro]] network, located in [[Charleroi]] downtown, in fare zone 1. Because of its situation on a slope, the station terminates on a viaduct at one end (toward [[Charleroi-West railway station|Ouest]] and [[Piges (Charleroi Pre-metro station)|Piges]]), and in a tunnel at the other end (toward [[Waterloo (Charleroi Pre-metro station)|Waterloo]]).

The station has two street entrances leading to a mezzanine level where ticket counters and shops are located. Platforms are accessible from the mezzanine through escalators and stairs.

The station has one lateral platform serving lines 88 and 89 to [[Anderlues]], and one central platform serving lines 54 and 89 to [[Charleroi-South railway station|Sud]] on one side, and lines 54 to [[Gilly (Charleroi Pre-metro station)|Gilly]] and 88 to [[Parc (Charleroi Pre-metro station)|Parc]] on the other side. A third platform, not accessible to passengers, is used to exhibit old Charleroi trams.

One particularity of the station is that trams from line 89 (in both directions) enter and leave the station from the same side, thus needing to execute a U-turn. To do so, trams first pass through the station on a track not linked to any platform, then enter a loop shaped tunnel to end up in the station again, but from the other side.

The name of the station comes from the nearby ''Palais des Beaux-Arts'' (Fine arts palace), a music/theatre venue.
