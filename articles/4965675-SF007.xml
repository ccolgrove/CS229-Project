'''Initng''' is a full replacement of the [[UNIX System V]] '''[[init]]''', the first process spawned by the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] in [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s, which is responsible for the initialization of every other process. Initng's website calls initng &quot;The next generation init system&quot;.

==Purpose==
Many implementations of init (including Sysvinit used in many [[Linux distribution]]s) start processes in a pre-determined order, and only start a process once the previous process finishes its initialization. Initng starts a process as soon as all of its dependencies are met. It can start several processes in parallel. Initng is designed to significantly increase the speed of booting a Unix-compatible system by starting processes asynchronously. Initng's supporters claim that it also gives the user more statistics and control over the system.

==Development==

Initng is still [[development stage#Beta|beta]]. Despite that, it was chosen as the default init system for [[Pingwinek]], [[Enlisy (operatin system)|Enlisy]], [[Berry Linux]] and [[Bee (operating system)|Bee]].

Also there are packages for many distributions such as [[Debian]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], as well as [[ebuild]]s for [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]] and spells for [[Source Mage]].

Contrary to other similar projects, it features a portable and flexible code base, more suited for embedded usage, and has been already ported to other operating systems like [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]] and [[FreeBSD]].

Initng was created by [[Jimmy Wennlund]]. The current maintainer and project lead is [[Ismael Luceno]].
