On April 19, 2006, Grisoft acquired the German company [[ewido Networks]], an anti-spyware software manufacturer, and incorporated ewido's features into new versions of AVG software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avg.co.uk/30868 |title=AVG Technologies announces release of ewido Anti-Spyware |publisher=Avg.co.uk |date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avguk.com/doc/30868/lng/uk/tpl/tpl01 |title=Grisoft announces release of ewido Anti-Spyware |publisher=Avguk.com |date=2006-06-19 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Grisoft was officially renamed AVG Technologies.

Plans to integrate Sana's technologies in their free consumer product, [[AVG (software)|AVG Anti-Virus]], are still under consideration, according to JR Smith, AVG's chief executive. Sana Security's developed technologies are currently licensed to Symantec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubenking |first=Neil J. |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2338797,00.asp |title=AVG Buys Sana's Behavior-Based Security Tech &amp;#124; News &amp; Opinion |publisher=PCMag.com |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meyer |first=David |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/security/0,1000000189,39591100,00.htm |title=AVG Technologies buys Sana Security &amp;#124; Security Management &amp;#124; ZDNet UK |publisher=News.zdnet.co.uk |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoffman |first=Stefanie |url=http://www.crn.com/security/212900313 |title=AVG Acquires Sana Security, Adds ID Protection |publisher=Crn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 9, 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of North Carolina-based Walling Data, a North America security software distribution that has distributed AVG offerings across the United States since 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avg.com/us-en/press-releases-news.ndi-230728 |title=Technologies Acquires Leading US Distributor, Walling Data |publisher=AVG |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2010, AVG announced the acquisition of [[Tel Aviv]]-based DroidSecurity, a company that specializes int the field of mobile security solutions, for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.

In December of 2010, AVG released a mandatory-install update to the 2011 version of its antivirus software which caused thousands of 64 bit Windows Vista and Windows 7 computers to become completely inoperable. AVG has since released a fix which attempts to repair computers bricked after installing the update. Affected users can watch the following video on AVG's Official YouTube page to resolve the issue

On August 20, 2010 AVG entered into partnership with [[MokaFive]] to secure desktop virtualisation solutions.
