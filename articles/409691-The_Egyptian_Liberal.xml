[[Image:Mary Bono Mack.jpg|thumb|Earlier photo of Mary Bono, c. 2005]]
The 45th had long been a Republican stronghold but has become much more Democratic in recent years; it currently has a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+3. While [[Moreno Valley]] and Palm Springs have a slight Democratic tilt, [[Palm Desert]] is strongly conservative. Her district includes the highest percentage of gays and lesbians of any district represented by a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/SameSexCouplesandGLBpopACS.pdf | title = Same-sex Couples and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Population: New Estimates from the American Community Survey | publisher = The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy, [[UCLA School of Law]] | date = October, 2006 | accessdate = February 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bono Mack followed the Republican Party line 89% of the time according to ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]''. In 2004, she received an 84% approval rating from the [[Christian Coalition of America]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.org/2004scorecard.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this fell to 33% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cc.org/files/3/2008_Scorecard_8_5x11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, she voted in favor of the Largent Amendment,&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1999/roll346.xml&lt;/ref&gt; to ban [[adoption by same-sex couples]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/pressreleases/july99/072999f.htm |title=Human Rights Campaign |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=1999-07-29 |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono Mack has, however, voted against the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] twice.

Some of the congresswoman's legislative history includes a bill that calls for country-of-origin labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as several energy-saving bills to reward companies for utilizing clean burning fuel technologies and increase the energy-efficiency of federal buildings. In 2000, Bono Mack helped pass legislation that established the [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]] in the [[Palm Springs]] region. The House of Representatives passed her [[Cyber-security_regulation#Proposed_regulation|'''S'''ecurely '''P'''rotect '''Y'''ourself '''A'''gainst '''C'''yber '''T'''respass]] (SPY ACT), which would protect an individualâs personal information on the Web. Also, Bono Mack has sponsored legislation that provides funding for obesity studies and improved nutrition programs nationwide, autism research, and Federal funding under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Act. &lt;ref name=&quot;bono.house.gov&quot;&gt;[http://bono.house.gov/Biography/] Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack: Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono Mack was a leading proponent of the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998, the so-called Mickey Mouse Law, which extended the terms of copyright. Giving a speech on the floor of Congress in favor of the bill, Bono Mack said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Actually, Sonny wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever. I am informed by staff that such a change would violate the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. ... As you know, there is also &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Motion Picture Association of America]] president] [[Jack Valenti]]'s proposal for the term to last forever less one day. Perhaps the Committee may look at that next Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=151115310684+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve 144 Congressional Record H9952]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She won her sixth term in 2008 with 58% of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;Riverside County Registrar of Voters&lt;/ref&gt; down slightly from 60.7% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marybono.com/news.php?id=113 Bono Election Day Schedule]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/congress.pdf |title=sov_detail_congress.xls |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When reflecting about his marriage and family, Sonny said, &quot;I've never been happier. For the first time I feel free to really love someone and to be a great father.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sonny Bono: And the beat goes on&lt;/ref&gt; Due to Sonny Bono's commitment to [[Scientology]] at the time, Bono Mack took some Scientology courses together with her husband but soon decided it was not for her.&lt;ref name=&quot;bardach&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Proud Mary Bono|work=[[George (magazine)|George Magazine]]|date=August 1999|last=Bardach|first=Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;
