The '''Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate''' ('''CUSID''' generally, and '''SUCDI''' in [[French language|French]]) is the national organization which governs all competitive university [[debating]] and [[public speaking]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Meany, John and Shuster, Kate.

Wadsworth Publishing, 2008. ISBN 978-0-495-09590-3.

Many prominent [[Canadians]] were university debaters, including former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Ministers]] [[Joe Clark]] and [[Brian Mulroney]], songwriter [[Leonard Cohen]], entrepreneur [[Moses Znaimer]], environmentalist [[David Suzuki]], and journalist [[Ian Hanomansing]]. CUSID debaters have gone on to notable careers in business, government and academia.

==History==
CUSID was officially founded in 1978, although it held its first annual tournament in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Debaters find bit of arrogance can be benefit http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19771121&amp;id=2dYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Bu4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2515,86433 &lt;/ref&gt;  The regular tournaments held under its auspices, such as those at the [[University of Toronto]], [[McGill University]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], and [[Queen's University]] predate CUSID's formation by many decades.

Founded as a national organization with strong central Canadian region roots, over the years, individual regional differencesâparticularly the separate identities of &quot;CUSID East&quot; and &quot;CUSID West&quot;âhave become more pronounced. One of its primary functions is facilitating communications between its members institutions. In recent years, those communications have been primarily through their online forum, ''CUSIDnet'', first set up in 1994, as the first online student debating forum in the world.

Annual invitational tournaments held in Canada include the [[McGill University]] Winter Carnival, the [[Queenâs University]] Chancellorâs Cup, the [[Carleton University]] Lord Dorchester Cup, the [[University of Toronto]] Hart House IV,&lt;ref&gt;[http://worlddebating.blogspot.com/2007/10/hart-house-university-of-toronto.html World Debating Website: Hart House BP Invitational]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Ottawa]] Father Guindon Cup, and the [[Wilfrid Laurier University]]/[[University of Waterloo]] Seagram Cup.

==Organization==
CUSID is subdivided into three regional bodies, representing each region of Canada:
* '''CUSID Central''', for [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]], which sponsors the Central Canadian Debating Championship (''LÃ©ger Cup'')
* '''CUSID East''', for the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic Provinces]], which sponsors the'' Atlantic Canadian Debating Championship''
* '''CUSID West''', for the [[Western Canada|Western Provinces]], [[Northern Canada|Territories]], and the U.S. state of [[Alaska]], which sponsors the Western Canadian Debating Championship (''McGoun Cup'')

CUSID nationally and internationally sanctions several official championship tournaments, including:
* [[Canadian National Debating Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;Dalhouse hosts national debating championships http://dalnews.dal.ca/2008/03/19/debate.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Canadian National French Debating Championship]] (CompÃ©titions Nationales FranÃ§aises SUCDI)
* [[North American Debating Championship]] (with the [[American Parliamentary Debate Association]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apdaweb.org/about/history APDA Web - Home of the American Parliamentary Debate Association &amp;#124; American College Debate Association - About]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlidebate.com/MoU.doc North American Debating Championship Memorandum of Understanding]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[World Universities Debating Championship]] (or WUDC, with many other national debating organizations)&lt;ref&gt;http://flynn.debating.net/CountRep.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidents===
The President of CUSID is the head of the organization and leads an elected executive team of six national and regional officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cusid.ca/about/past-executive/ Past Executive &amp;#124; CUSID]&lt;/ref&gt; He or she also represents CUSID and Canadian debating interests inside and outside of Canada, and is the Canadian representative on the [[World Universities Debating Championship#World Universities Debating Council|World Universities Debating Council]]. He or she is elected annually by the member institutions at the National Championships.

==Format==
CUSID tournaments are held in the Canadian Parliamentary Style of debate. This style emphasizes argumentation and rhetoric, rather than research and detailed factual knowledge. Each round consists of two teams â the government team and the opposition team â each of which consists of two debaters. Teams alternate between government and opposition at tournaments. The speaking times in CUSID Central and East are:

* Prime Minister (Constructive): 7&amp;nbsp;minutes
* Member of Opposition: 7&amp;nbsp;minutes
* Minister of the Crown: 7&amp;nbsp;minutes
* Leader of Opposition: 10&amp;nbsp;minutes
* Prime Minister (Rebuttal): 3&amp;nbsp;minutes

A new modification to the above times was introduced at the 2003 McGill University Winter Carnival Invitational called the Prime Minister's Rebuttal Extension (PMRE). The PMRE allows the government team the option to take a 6&amp;nbsp;minute PMC and 4&amp;nbsp;minute PMR and was designed to help compensate for the alleged inherent advantage to the opposition side. In most rounds, the resolution is âsquirrelableâ, meaning that the government team can propose any topic it wants for debate. The Prime Minister Constructive (PMC) lays out the topic for debate and presents arguments in favor of its position. The opposition team must then immediately present opposing arguments. New arguments can be presented in the first four speeches; they are prohibited in the rebuttal speeches.

&quot;Points of Information&quot; are generally permitted and expected in the standard Canadian Parliamentary style. With POIs, debaters may rise and attempt to ask a question of an opposing debater, who can choose whether to accept or refuse the question. It is generally considered good form to accept at least a few questions during a speech.
