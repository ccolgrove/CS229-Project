Android consists of a [[Kernel (software)|kernel]] based on the [[Linux kernel]], with [[middleware]], [[software library|libraries]] and [[Application programming interface|API]]s written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[application software]] running on an [[application framework]] which includes Java-compatible libraries based on [[Apache Harmony]]. Android uses the [[Dalvik virtual machine]] with [[just-in-time compilation]] to run Dalvik dex-code (Dalvik Executable), which is usually translated from [[Java (programming language)|Java]] bytecode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/11/14/What-Android-Is |title=What Android Is |author=Tim Bray|work=ongoing by Tim Bray|date=24 November 2010|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Android has a large community of developers writing applications (&quot;apps&quot;) that extend the functionality of the devices.  Developers write primarily in a customized version of Java.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.news.com/8301-13580_3-9815495-39.html | title = Google's Android parts ways with Java industry group | work = [[CNET News]] | first = Stephen | last = Shankland | date = 12 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently approximately 400,000 apps available for Android, from a total of 600,000 apps over the life of Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.t3.com/news/android-market-reaches-500000-app-mark | title = Android Market reaches 500,000 app mark |publisher=www.t3.com | date = 2011-10-23 | accessdate = 2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;i/o 2011 stats&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/android-momentum-mobile-and-more-at.html | title = Android: momentum, mobile and more at Google I/O | first = Hugo | last = Barra | work = The Official Google Blog | date = 10 May 2011 | accessdate = 10 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx | title = Android Stats | date = 30 Nov 2011 | accessdate = 30 Nov 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apps can be downloaded from third-party sites or through online stores such as [[Android Market]], the app store run by Google.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===&lt;!-- Linked to this heading: 'Android, Inc.' redirect; 'Andy Rubin' article --&gt;
Android, Inc. was founded in [[Palo Alto, California]], United States in October, 2003 by [[Andy Rubin]] (co-founder of [[Danger (company)|Danger]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;AndyRubin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04google.html?_r=2&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=I, Robot: The Man Behind the Google Phone |accessdate=2008-10-14 |last=Markoff |first=John |date=2007-11-04 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rich Miner]] (co-founder of Wildfire Communications, Inc.),&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/09/02/introducing_the_google_phone/ |title=Introducing the Google Phone |first=Scott |last=Kirsner |accessdate=2008-10-24 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2007-09-02|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100104054533/http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/09/02/introducing_the_google_phone/|archivedate=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Sears (once VP at [[T-Mobile USA|T-Mobile]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Nick&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nokia.com/A4136002?newsid=918410 |title=T-Mobile Brings Unlimited Multiplayer Gaming to US Market with First Launch of Nokia N-Gage Game Deck |accessdate=2009-04-05 |date=23 September 2003 |publisher=Nokia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chris White (headed design and interface development at [[WebTV]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2005/tc20050817_0949_tc024.htm |accessdate=2009-04-23 |title=Google Buys Android for Its Mobile Arsenal |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |first=Ben |last=Elgin |date=17 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop, in Rubin's words &quot;...smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndroidInc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2005/tc20050817_0949_tc024.htm |title=Google Buys Android for Its Mobile Arsenal |first=Ben |last=Elgin |date=2005-08-17 |work=businessweek.com |publisher=Bloomberg L.P |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wk7sIvVb |archivedate=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-24 |quote=In what could be a key move in its nascent wireless strategy, Google (GOOG) has quietly acquired startup Android Inc....}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the obvious past accomplishments of the founders and early employees, Android Inc. operated secretly, revealing only that it was working on software for mobile phones.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndroidInc&quot; /&gt;

That same year, Rubin ran out of money. [[Steve Perlman]] brought him $10,000 in cash in an envelope and refused a stake in the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;StevePerlman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.airsla.org/broadcasts/BusinessWeek110802.mp3 |title=A Thousand Times Yes |accessdate=2011-11-09 |last=Vance |first=Ashlee |date=2011-08-07 |publisher=Bloomberg BusinessWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquisition by Google ===
[[Google]] acquired Android Inc. in August 2005, making Android Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary of Google Inc. Key employees of Android Inc., including Andy Rubin, Rich Miner and Chris White, stayed at the company after the acquisition.&lt;ref name=&quot;gba&quot;/&gt; Not much was known about Android Inc. at the time of the acquisition, but many assumed that Google was planning to enter the [[mobile phone]] market with this move.&lt;ref name=&quot;gba&quot;/&gt;

=== Post-acquisition development ===
At Google, the team led by Rubin developed a mobile device platform powered by the [[Linux kernel]]. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and [[Mobile network operator|carriers]] on the premise of providing a flexible, upgradable system. Google had lined up a series of hardware component and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation on their part.&lt;ref name=&quot;EngadgetMobileOS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/28/google-is-working-on-a-mobile-os-and-its-due-out-shortly/ |title=Google is working on a mobile OS, and it's due out shortly |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Block |first=Ryan |date=2007-08-28 |work=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB118602176520985718-lMyQjAxMDE3ODA2MjAwMjIxWj.html |title=Google Pushes Tailored Phones To Win Lucrative Ad Market |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last1=Sharma |first1=Amol |first2=Kevin J. |last2=Delaney |date=2007-08-02 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directtraffic.org/OnlineNews/Google_admits_to_mobile_phone_plan_18094880.html |title=Google admits to mobile phone plan |accessdate=2007-11-06 |date=2007-03-20 |work=directtraffic.org |publisher=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation about Google's intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKay&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=McKay |first=Martha |date=21 December 2006 |title=Can iPhone become your phone?; Linksys introduces versatile line for cordless service |work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|]] |page=L9 |quote=And don't hold your breath, but the same cell phone-obsessed tech watchers say it won't be long before Google jumps headfirst into the phone biz. Phone, anyone?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports from the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' noted that Google wanted its search and applications on mobile phones and it was working hard to deliver that. Print and online media outlets soon reported rumors that Google was developing a Google-branded [[Handset#Telephony|handset]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LIgPhone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/59115.html |title=Blogosphere Aflutter With Linux-Based phone Rumors |accessdate=2007-11-07 |last=Ackerman |first=Elise |date=2007-08-30 |work=Linux Insider}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculated that as Google was defining technical specifications, it was showing prototypes to cell phone manufacturers and network operators.

In September 2007, ''[[InformationWeek]]'' covered an [[Evalueserve]] study reporting that Google had filed several [[patent]] applications in the area of mobile telephony.&lt;ref name=&quot;IWpatents&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201807587&amp;cid=nl_IWK_daily |title=Google's Secret Patent Portfolio Predicts gPhone |accessdate=2007-11-06 |last=Claburn |first=Thomas |date=2007-09-19 |work=[[InformationWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MNpatents&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moconews.net/entry/419-googles-strong-mobile-related-patent-portfolio/ |title=Google's Strong Mobile-Related Patent Portfolio |accessdate=2007-11-07 |last=Pearce |first=James Quintana |date=2007-09-20 |work=mocoNews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open Handset Alliance develops the GPL-licensed part of Android, that is their changes to the Linux kernel, in public, with source code publicly available at all times. The rest of Android is developed in private, with source code released publicly when a major new version is released. Typically Google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device featuring the new version of Android, then makes the source code available after that device has been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com/faqs.html#what-is-involved-in-releasing-the-source-code-for-a-new-android-version |title=Frequently Asked Questions: What is involved in releasing the source code for a new Android version? |work=Android Open Source Project |accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the software is open source, device manufacturers cannot use Google's Android trademark unless Google certifies that the device complies with their Compatibility Definition Document (CDD). Devices must also meet this definition to be eligible to license Google's closed-source applications, including the [[Android Market]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Compatibility_FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://source.android.com/faqs.html#compatibility |title=Android Open Source Project Frequently Asked Questions: Compatibility|work=source.android.com |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, [[Skyhook Wireless]] filed a lawsuit against Google in which they alleged that Google had used the compatibility document to block Skyhook's mobile positioning service (XPS) from Motorola's Android mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |url=http://daringfireball.net//misc/2010/09/Skyhook-Google%20Complaint%20and%20Jury%20Demand.pdf|litigants=Skyhook Wireless, Inc. vs Google, Inc|date=15 September 2010 |quote=This entirely subjective review, conducted solely by Google employees with ultimate authority to interpret the scope and meaning of the CDD as they see fit, effectively gives Google the ability to arbitrarily deem any software, feature or function 'non-compatible' with the CDD.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010 a judge denied Skyhook's motion for preliminary injunction, saying that Google had not closed off the possibility of accepting a revised version of Skyhook's XPS service, and that Motorola had terminated their contract with Skyhook because Skyhook wanted to disable Google's location data collection functions on Motorola's devices, which would have violated Motorola's obligations to Google and its carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.socialaw.com/slip.htm?cid=20416&amp;sid=121 |title=Skyhook Wireless, Inc. vs. Google, Inc. |work=Social Law Library Research Portal |date=December 2010|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, Google chose to temporarily withhold the Android source code to the tablet-only Honeycomb release, creating doubts over Google's commitment to open source with Android.&lt;ref name=&quot;Honeycombclosed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Android 3.0 &quot;Honeycomb&quot;: Open source no more |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/google/google-android-30-honeycomb-open-source-no-more/2845 |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=2011-03-24|accessdate=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason, according to [[Andy Rubin]] in an official Android blog post, was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bray |first=Tim |url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/04/i-think-im-having-gene-amdahl-moment.html |title=Android Developers Blog: I think Iâm having a Gene Amdahl moment |publisher=Android-developers.blogspot.com |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they did not want third parties creating a &quot;really bad user experience&quot; by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Honeycomb won&amp;#039;t be open-sourced?

== Design ==
=== Linux ===
Android's kernel is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the [[Linux kernel]] and has further architecture changes by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBGfUs9mQYY |title= Androidology â Part 1 of 3 â Architecture Overview |date=2008-09-06 |accessdate=2007-11-07 |medium=Video |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android does not have a native [[X Window System]] nor does it support the full set of standard [[GNU]] libraries, and this makes it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/open-source/reviews/2009/02/an-introduction-to-google-android-for-developers.ars | title=Dream(sheep++): A developer's introduction to Google Android | date=23 February 2009 | last=Paul |first=Ryan | work=[[Ars Technica]] | accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain features that Google contributed back to the kernel, notably a power management feature called wakelocks, were rejected by mainline kernel developers, partly because kernel maintainers felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain their own code.&lt;ref name=&quot;hartmann2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-389733.html |title = Linux developer explains Android kernel code removal |date = 2010-02-02 |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |accessdate = 2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hartmann&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/android-kernel-problems.html |title = Android and the Linux kernel community |date = 2010-02-02 |author=[[Greg Kroah-Hartman]] |accessdate = 2010-02-03 |quote=''Google shows no sign of working to get their code upstream anymore.

However, in September 2010 Linux kernel developer Rafael J. Wysocki added a patch that improved the mainline Linux wakeup events framework. He said that Android device drivers that use wakelocks can now be easily merged into mainline Linux, but that Android's opportunistic suspend features should not be included in the mainline kernel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lwn.net/Articles/416690/ |title=An alternative to suspend blockers|author=Rafael J.

; Handset layouts: The platform is adaptable to larger, [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]], [[2D computer graphics|2D graphics]] library, [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] library based on [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0 specifications, and traditional smartphone layouts.
; Storage: [[SQLite]], a lightweight [[relational database]], is used for data storage purposes.
; Connectivity: Android supports connectivity technologies including [[GSM]]/[[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], [[Integrated Digital Enhanced Network|IDEN]], [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]], [[Evolution-Data Optimized|EV-DO]], [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[LTE Advanced|LTE]], [[Near field communication|NFC]] and [[WiMAX]].
; Messaging: [[SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] are available forms of messaging, including threaded [[text messaging]] and now [[Android Cloud To Device Messaging]] (C2DM) is also a part of Android Push Messaging service.
; Multiple language support: Android supports multiple [[language]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;gingerbread-highlights&quot;/&gt;
; Web browser: The web browser available in Android is based on the open-source [[WebKit]] layout engine, coupled with [[Google Chrome|Chrome's]] [[V8 JavaScript engine]]. The browser scores 100/100 on the [[Acid3#Mobile_browsers|Acid3]] test on Android 4.0, however does have some rendering issues.
; Java support: While most Android applications are written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], there is no [[Java Virtual Machine]] in the platform and Java byte code is not executed. Java classes are compiled into Dalvik executables and run on [[Dalvik virtual machine|Dalvik]], a specialized virtual machine designed specifically for Android and optimized for battery-powered mobile devices with limited memory and CPU. [[J2ME]] support can be provided via third-party applications.
; Media support: Android supports the following audio/video/still media formats: [[WebM]], [[H.263]], [[H.264]] (in [[3GP]] or [[MP4]] [[container format (digital)|container]]), [[MPEG-4 Part 2|MPEG-4 SP]], [[Adaptive multi-rate compression|AMR]], [[AMR-WB]] (in 3GP container), [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[HE-AAC]] (in MP4 or 3GP container), [[MP3]], [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]], [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], [[Free Lossless Audio Codec|FLAC]], [[WAV]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]], [[BMP file format|BMP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mediaformats&quot; /&gt;
; Streaming media support: RTP/RTSP streaming ([[3GPP PSS]], [[Internet Streaming Media Alliance|ISMA]]), HTML progressive download (HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag). Adobe Flash Streaming (RTMP) and HTTP Dynamic Streaming are supported by the Flash plugin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/860/cpsid_86018.html | title=Flash Flayer 10.1 for Android 2.2 Release Notes | work=Adobe Knowledgebase | accessdate=27 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple HTTP Live Streaming is supported by RealPlayer for Mobile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.realnetworks.com/pressroom/releases/2010/RealPlayer-for-Mobile-Delivers-HTTP-Live-Content-to-Android.aspx | title=RealNetworks Gives Handset and Tablet OEMs Ability to Deliver HTTP Live Content to Android Users | RealNetworks | work=realnetworks.com | date=10 September 2010 | accessdate=27 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the operating system in Android 3.0 (Honeycomb).&lt;ref name=&quot;honeycomb-highlights&quot;/&gt;
; Additional hardware support: Android can use video/still cameras, [[touchscreen]]s, [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[accelerometer]]s, [[gyroscope]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[magnetometer]]s, dedicated gaming controls, [[proximity sensor|proximity]] and [[pressure sensor]]s, [[thermometer]]s, accelerated 2D [[bit blit]]s (with hardware orientation, scaling, pixel format conversion) and accelerated 3D graphics.
; Multi-touch: Android has native support for [[multi-touch]] which was initially made available in handsets such as the [[HTC Hero]]. The feature was originally disabled at the kernel level (possibly to avoid infringing Apple's patents on touch-screen technology at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10161312-37.html |work = [[CNET News]] |title = Report: Apple nixed Android's multitouch |date = 11 February 2009 |first = Steven |last = Musil |accessdate = 2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google has since released an update for the [[Nexus One]] and the [[Motorola Droid]] which enables multi-touch natively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/02/nexus-one-gets-a-software-update-enables-multitouch/ |title = Nexus One gets a software update, enables multitouch |work = [[Engadget]] |first = Chris |last = Ziegler |date = 2 February 2010 |accessdate =2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Bluetooth: Supports [[A2DP]], [[AVRCP]], sending files ([[Object Push Profile|OPP]]), accessing the phone book ([[Bluetooth profile#Phone Book Access Profile (PBAP, PBA)|PBAP]]), voice dialing and sending contacts between phones. Keyboard, mouse and joystick ([[Bluetooth profile#Human Interface Device Profile (HID)|HID]]) support is available in Android 3.1+, and in earlier versions through manufacturer customizations and third-party applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.1-highlights.html#UserFeatures |title=Android 3.1 Platform Highlights|work=Android Developers|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Video calling: Android does not support native video calling, but some handsets have a customized version of the operating system that supports it, either via the [[UMTS]] network (like the [[Samsung Galaxy S]]) or over IP. Video calling through Google Talk is available in Android 2.3.4 and later. Gingerbread allows [[Nexus S]] to place Internet calls with a SIP account. This allows for enhanced VoIP dialing to other SIP accounts and even phone numbers. Skype 2.1 offers video calling in Android 2.3, including front camera support.
; Multitasking: Multitasking of applications is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/04/multitasking-android-way.html | title=Multitasking the Android Way | work=Android Developers | last=Bray | first=Tim | date=28 April 2010 | accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Voice based features: Google search through voice has been available since initial release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/speech-input.html | title=Speech Input for Google Search | work=Android Developers | accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice actions for calling, texting, navigation, etc. are supported on Android 2.2 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/ | title=Voice Actions for Android | work=google.com | accessdate=27 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Tethering: Android supports [[tethering]], which allows a phone to be used as a wireless/wired [[Wi-Fi hotspot]]. Before Android 2.2 this was supported by third-party applications or manufacturer customizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/190265/use_your_android_phone_as_a_wireless_modem.html | title=Use Your Android Phone as a Wireless Modem | publisher=PCWorld | author=JR Raphael | date=6 May 2010 | accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Screen capture: Android has native support for [[screenshot]] capture ability by pressing the power and volume buttons at the same time on an Android device. This native support came about with the release of Android's [[Android version history#4.x Ice Cream Sandwich|4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)]] update which is first seen on the [[Galaxy Nexus]] smartphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/242128/samsung_google_unveil_latest_android_os_phone.html | title=Samsung, Google Unveil Latest Android OS, Phone  | publisher=PCWorld | author=Nancy Gohring | date=19 October 2011 | accessdate=19 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously Android did not feature native support for screen capturing which would have likely been due to security concerns. Furthermore previously, manufacturer and third-party customizations as well as using a PC connection (DDMS developer's tool) were the only known methods of capturing a screenshot on Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.androidsim.net/2011/06/how-to-25-taking-screen-shots-on.html | title=Taking Screen Shots On The Android | publisher=AndroidSim | author=T.

The open and customizable nature of the Android operating system allows it to be used in pretty much any electronics, including but not limited to: [[smartphone]]s, [[laptop]]s, [[netbook]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[Google TV]], [[wristwatch]]es,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://live.imwatch.it/ |title=i'm Watch |publisher=Live.imwatch.it |date= |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[headphones]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/12/now_audio_admiral_touch/&lt;/ref&gt; Car CD and DVD players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/car-player-android.html |title=Car Player Android-Car Player Android Manufacturers, Suppliers and Exporters on |publisher=Alibaba.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mashable.com/2011/05/12/ice-cream-sandwich/ |title=Androids Unite: How Ice Cream Sandwich Will End the OS Schism |author=Jolie O'Dell |work=Mashable |date = 12 May 2011 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/06/toshiba-ac100-android-smartbook-hits-the-united-kingdom/ |title=Toshiba AC100 Android smartbook hits the United Kingdom |author=Laura June |work=Engadget |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/22665/run-android-on-your-netbook-or-desktop/ |title=Run Android on Your Netbook or Desktop |publisher=How-To Geek |date= |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main hardware platform for Android is the [[ARM architecture]]. There is support for [[x86]] from the Android-x86 project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.android-x86.org/ |title=Android-x86 - Porting Android to x86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Google TV uses a special x86 version of Android.

The first commercially available phone to run Android was the [[HTC Dream]], released on 22 October 2008.&lt;ref name=HTC&gt;{{cite news |publisher=HTC |url=http://www.htc.com/www/press.aspx?id=66338&amp;lang=1033 |accessdate=2009-05-19 |title=T-Mobile Unveils the T-Mobile G1 - the First Phone Powered by Android}} AT&amp;T's first device to run the Android OS was the Motorola Backflip.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2010 Google collaborated with [[HTC]] to launch its flagship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/mar/14/google-mobile-phone-launch-delay |title=Google forced to delay British launch of Nexus phone |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=14 March 2010 |author=Richard Wray |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android device, the [[Nexus One]]. This was followed later in 2010 with the [[Samsung]]-made [[Nexus S]] and in 2011 with the [[Galaxy Nexus]].

[[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] and Android 2.3.3 'Gingerbread' may be set up to dual boot on a [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken iPhone or iPod Touch]] with the help of OpeniBoot and iDroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/196595/how_to_install_android_on_your_iphone.html |title=How to Install Android on Your iPhone |author=David Wang |publisher=pcworld.com |date=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idroidproject.org/ |title=Idroidproject.org |publisher=Idroidproject.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
{{see also|Android software development|List of open source Android applications}}

Applications are usually developed in the Java language using the [[Android SDK|Android Software Development Kit]], but other development tools are available, including a [[Android software development#Native Development Kit|Native Development Kit]] for applications or extensions in C or C++, [[Google App Inventor]], a visual environment for novice programmers and various [[Multiple phone web based application framework|cross platform mobile web applications frameworks]] .

=== Android Market ===
{{Main|Android Market}}

Android Market is the online software store developed by Google for Android devices. An application program (&quot;app&quot;) called &quot;Market&quot; is preinstalled on most Android devices and allows users to browse and download apps published by third-party developers, hosted on Android Market. {{As of|2010|December}} there were about 200,000 games, applications and widgets available on the Android Market.&lt;ref name=&quot;200,000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Android App Stats|url=http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx|accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011 Google said there had been more than 3 billion Android apps installed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/14/google-3-billion-android-apps-installed-up-50-percent-from-last-quarter/ |title=Google: 3 Billion Android Apps Installed; Downloads Up 50 Percent From Last Quarter |author=Leena Rao|work=Techcrunch|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at end of June 2011 there are 6 billion apps installs from the Android market. The operating system itself is installed on 130 million total devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/14/google-android-now-on-130-million-total-devices/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29 |title=Google Android now on 130M total devices, with 6B app downloads |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements are allowed to preinstall Google's closed-source Android Market app and access the Market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html | title=Android Compatibility | work=Android Open Source Project | accessdate=31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Market filters the list of applications presented by the Market app to those that are compatible with the user's device, and developers may restrict their applications to particular carriers or countries for business reasons.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/compatibility.html | title=Android Compatibility | work=Android Developers | accessdate=31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google has participated in the Android Market by offering several applications themselves, including [[Google Voice]] (for the Google Voice service), Sky Map (for watching stars), Finance (for their finance service), Maps Editor (for their MyMaps service), Places Directory (for their Local Search), [[Google Goggles]] that searches by image, Gesture Search (for using finger-written letters and numbers to search the contents of the phone), Google Translate, Google Shopper, Listen for podcasts and My Tracks, a jogging application. In August 2010, Google launched &quot;Voice Actions for Android&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/mobile/voice-actions/index.html |title=Voice Actions for Android |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows users to search, write messages, and initiate calls by voice.

Alternatively, users can install apps from third party app stores such as the [[Amazon Appstore]],&lt;ref name=&quot;wired_alt_app_stores&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/06/independent-app-stores-take-on-googles-android-market/ | title=Independent App Stores Take On Googleâs Android Market | date=June 11, 2010 | first=Priya | last=Ganapati | publisher=[[Wired News]] | accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; or directly onto the device if they have the application's [[APK (file format)|APK]] file.

=== Application security ===
[[File:AndroidMarketPermissions.png|thumb|An example of app permissions in Android Market.]]

Android applications run in a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]], an isolated area of the operating system that does not have access to the rest of the system's resources, unless access permissions are granted by the user when the application is installed. Before installing an application, Android Market displays all required permissions.  A game may need to enable vibration, for example, but should not need to read messages or access the phonebook.  After reviewing these permissions, the user can decide whether to install the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://source.android.com/tech/security/index.html |title=Android Security Overview |work=Android Open Source Project|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Android [[malware]] incidents have been reported involving rogue applications on Android Market. In August 2010, [[Kaspersky|Kaspersky Lab]] reported detection of the first malicious program for Android, named [[Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakePlayer.a]], an [[Premium SMS|SMS]] [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] which had already infected a number of devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207576158 |title=First SMS Trojan detected for smartphones running Android |publisher=Kaspersky Lab |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases applications which contained [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojans]] were hidden in [[Copyright infringement of software|pirated]] versions of legitimate apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/01/the-mother-of-all-android-malware-has-arrived-stolen-apps-released-to-the-market-that-root-your-phone-steal-your-data-and-open-backdoor/ |title = The Mother Of All Android Malware Has Arrived |work = Android Police |first = Android Police |date = March 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perez |first=Sarah |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/android_vulnerability_so_dangerous_shouldnt_use_web_browser.php |title=Android Vulnerability So Dangerous, Owners Warned Not to Use Phone's Web Browser |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google has responded by removing malicious apps from the Android Market, and remotely disabling them on infected devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/05/android-malware-rootkit-google-response/ |title=Google Responds To Android Malware, Will Fix Infected Devices And âRemote Killâ Malicious Apps |work=[[Tech Crunch]] |first = Tech Crunch |date = March 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Security firms such as [[AVG Technologies]] and [[Symantec]] have released antivirus software for Android devices.

=== Privacy ===
Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of [[Wi-Fi]] access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build vast databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run apps like [[Foursquare (social network)|Foursquare]], [[Google Latitude|Latitude]], [[Facebook Places|Places]], and to deliver location-based ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/technology/09google.html?pagewanted=all |title=Skyhook Wireless v. Google Case Yields E-Mail Insight|author=Steve Lohr|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 May 2011|publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One design issue is that average users cannot monitor how applications access and use private and sensitive data (e.g. location and hardware ID numbers). Even during installation, permission checks do not often indicate to the user how critical services and data will be used or misused. Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://appanalysis.org/faq.html |title=AppAnalysis.org: Real Time Privacy Monitoring on Smartphones |accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; an academic research-funded project, can identify personal information sent from applications to remote servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fastcompany.com/1692088/android-apps-leaking-your-personal-data-to-ad-firms-says-taintdroid-app |title=TaintDroid Tracks Leaks of Personal Data to Ad Firms |author=Kit Eaton|work=FastCompany|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
The Android logo was designed along with the [[Droid (font)|Droid font family]] made by [[Ascender Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.forbes.com/2008/09/25/font-android-g1-tech-wire-cx_ew_0926font.html |title = Android's Very Own Font |work = [[Forbes]] |first = Elizabeth |last = Woyke |date = 26 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android Green is the color of the Android Robot that represents the Android operating system. The print color is [[Pantone|PMS]] 376C and the [[RGB color model|RGB color]] value in hexadecimal is #A4C639, as specified by the Android Brand Guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.android.com/branding.html |work = Android |title = Brand Guidelines |date = 23 March 2009 |accessdate =2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom typeface of Android is called Norad (cf.

It is only used in the text logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.android.com/branding.html |work = Android |title = Android Brand Guidelines |date = 23 March 2009 |accessdate =2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Market share ===
Research company [[Canalys]] estimated in Q2 2009 that Android had a 2.8% share of worldwide [[smartphone]] shipments.&lt;ref name=Insider_1&gt;{{cite news |title=Canalys: iPhone outsold all Windows Mobile phones in Q2 2009 |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/08/21/canalys_iphone_outsold_all_windows_mobile_phones_in_q2_2009.html |newspaper=[[AppleInsider]] |date=21 August 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Q4 2010 this had grown to 33% of the market, becoming the top-selling smartphone platform. This estimate includes the Tapas and OMS variants of Android.&lt;ref name=&quot;canalysQ42010&quot;/&gt; By Q3 2011 [[Gartner]] estimates more than half (52.5%) of the smartphone market belongs to Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1848514 |title=Gartner Says Sales of Mobile Devices Grew 5.6 Percent in Third Quarter of 2011; Smartphone Sales Increased 42 Percent|date= 15 November 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 [[ComScore]] said the Android platform had 9.0% of the U.S. smartphone market, as measured by current mobile subscribers. This figure was up from an earlier estimate of 5.2% in November 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;ComScore Feb 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mycomscore.net/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2010/4/comScore_Reports_February_2010_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share | title=comScore Reports February 2010 U.S. Mobile Subscriber Market Share | work=Comscore.com | date=5 April 2010 | accessdate=24 December 2010 | quote=RIM, 42.1%; Apple, 25.4%; Microsoft, 15.1%; Google (Android), 9.0%; Palm, 5.4%; others, 3.0% }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of Q3 2010 Android's U.S. market share had grown to 21.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2010/11/comScore_Reports_September_2010_U.S._Mobile_Subscriber_Market_Share |title=comScore Reports September 2010 U.S. Mobile Subscriber Market Share |work=Comscore.com |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Android's first quarter U.S. sales surpassed that of the rival iPhone platform. According to a report by the NPD group, Android achieved 25% smartphone sales in the US market, up 8% from the December quarter. In the second quarter, Apple's iOS was up by 11%, indicating that Android is taking market share mainly from [[Research In Motion|RIM]], and still has to compete with heavy consumer demand for new competitor offerings.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.cnet.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-20012627-94.html |title= Android hits top spot in U.S. smartphone market |date= 2010-08-04 |accessdate= 2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, analysts pointed to advantages that Android has as a multi-channel, multi-carrier OS, which allowed it to duplicate the quick success of Microsoft's Windows Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-20012418-37.html |title= More signs iPhone under Android attack |date= 2010-08-02 |author= Greg Sandoval |accessdate= 2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Q4 2010 Android had 59% of the total installed user base of Apple's [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] in the U.S. and 46% of the total installed user base of [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;comscore Q42010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2011/4/ |title=Apple iOS Platform Outreaches Android by 59 Percent in U.S. When Accounting for Mobile Phones, Tablets and Other Connected Media Devices |work=comScore |date=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalrymple Android iPhone&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loopinsight.com/2011/04/28/the-truth-about-android-vs-iphone-market-share/ | title=The truth about Android vs. iPhone market share |author=Dalrymple, Jim |date=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retail Stores ===

The world's first Android store opened on Bourke Street, Melbourne in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apcmag.com/meet-androidland-australia-opens-world-first-android-store-in-melbourne.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intellectual property infringement claims ==
{{See also|Oracle Corporation#Lawsuit against Google}}

Both Android and Android phone manufacturers have been the target of numerous patent lawsuits. On 12 August 2010, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9180678/Update_Oracle_sues_Google_over_Java_use_in_Android |title=Update: Oracle sues Google over Java use in Android |first=James |last=Niccolai |date=12 August 2010 |work=Computerworld |publisher=International Data Group Inc |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the patent infringement claim references seven United States patents including {{patent|US|5966702|&quot;Method and apparatus for pre-processing and packaging class files&quot;}}, and {{patent|US|6910205|&quot;Interpreting functions utilizing a hybrid of virtual and native machine instructions&quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/35811761/Oracle-s-complaint-against-Google-for-Java-patent-infringement |title=Oracle's complaint against Google for Java patent infringement |publisher=[[scribd.com]] |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android is based on [[Apache Harmony]], a [[clean room design|clean room]] implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/10/google-oracle-android/ |title=Calling Oracle Hypocritical, Google Denies Patent Infringement |first=Ryan |last=Singel |date=5 October 2010 |work=Wired News |publisher=CondÃ© Nast |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20101005114201136 |title=Google Answers Oracle, Counterclaims, and Moves to Dismiss Copyright Infringement Claim |date=5 October 2010 |work=Groklaw |publisher=Pamela Jones |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20101111114933605 |title=Google Files Sizzling Answer to Oracle's Amended Complaint and its Opposition to Motion to Dismiss; updated 2Xs |date=11 November 2010 |work=Groklaw |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Microsoft]] has also sued several manufacturers of Android devices for patent infringement, and collects patent licensing fees from others. In October 2011 Microsoft said they had signed license agreements with ten Android device manufacturers, accounting for 55% of worldwide revenue for Android devices.&lt;ref name=10agreements&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft collects license fees on 50% of Android devices, tells Google to &quot;wake up&quot; |url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/10/microsoft-collects-license-fees-on-50-of-android-devices-tells-google-to-wake-up.ars |work=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=2011-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Samsung]] and [[HTC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9220357/Microsoft_signs_Android_licensing_deal_with_Samsung |title=Microsoft signs Android licensing deal with Samsung |author=Mikael RicknÃ¤s |work=Computerworld |date=28 September 2011 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Inc.]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]] claimed that Android copied major elements of Apple's [[iPhone]] and [[iOS]] operating system. According to his [[Steve Jobs (biography)|biography]], Jobs stated that Android is a &quot;stolen product,&quot; and vowed to destroy it. âI will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,â said Jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Isaacson | first=Walter | authorlink=Walter Isaacson| title=[[Steve Jobs (biography)|Steve Jobs]] | year=2011 | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location=New York  | isbn=1-451-64853-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google has publicly expressed its dislike for the current patent landscape in the [[United States]], accusing Apple, Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation, rather than innovating and competing with better products and services.&lt;ref name=&quot;bully&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Google publicly accuses Apple, Microsoft, Oracle of patent bullying | url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/08/google-publicly-accuses-apple-microsoft-oracle-of-patent-bullying.ars | accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Google purchased [[Motorola Mobility]] for [[USD|US$]]12.5 billion, which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect Android, since Motorola Mobility has a 17,000-strong patent pool.&lt;ref name=&quot;moto&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Google, needing patents, buys Motorola wireless for $12.5 billion | url=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/08/google-to-buy-motorola-in-effort-to-defend-itself-from-patent-bullies.ars | accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
