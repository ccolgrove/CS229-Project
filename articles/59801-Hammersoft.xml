The '''University of Virginia''' (also '''The University''',&lt;ref&gt;Many universities' students and alumni refer to their respective institutions as &quot;the university&quot; for short. At the University of Virginia, this title is capitalized as a proper noun (i.e., &quot;The University&quot; or &quot;the University&quot;)[http://www.hrs.virginia.edu/dot/topics/ppd/newsupervisor/university_slang.htm] in reference only to this particular school, much like [[The Lawn]] and [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|The Rotunda]]. In recent decades many of the school's alumni and students have sported university-licensed bumper stickers and window decals of simply THE UNIVERSITY in the school's colors ([http://www.mincers.com/php-bin/ecomm4/products.php?product_id=514]), a practice not always well understood or appreciated by outsiders, leaving some to declare such usage to be elitist.[http://www.readthehook.com/newcomer.html] However, the vernacular tradition goes back more than a hundred years, as indicated in the following excerpt from a 1903 novel.[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15573/15573-h/15573-h.htm]&lt;big&gt;{{Quotation|But hardest of all to leave had been Archie, best and most promising of young brothersâArchie, who had come out ahead of his class in the high-school, all ready to go to The Universityâthe University of Virginia is always &quot;The University&quot;; but who, it had seemed at a certain dark season, must give up this long-cherished hope for lack of the wherewithal.|[[Marie Manning (writer)|Marie Manning]], 1903|Judith of the Plains}}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; '''Mr. Jefferson's University''', or '''Virginia'''; often abbreviated as '''U.Va.''' or '''UVA''') is a [[public university|public]] research university located in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], [[United States]], founded by [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Conceived by 1800 and established in 1819, it is the only university in the United States to be designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]], an honor it shares with nearby [[Monticello]].  

The 2012 edition of ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranks the University of Virginia as the 2nd best public university in the [[United States]], and the overall 25th best university in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public |title=Best Colleges 2012: Top Public Schools |work=[[US News and World Report]] |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University is notable for having highly ranked programs, including its [[University of Virginia Law School|law school]] (Ranked 9th),  [[McIntire School of Commerce|undergraduate business school]] (Ranked 2nd), [[Darden Graduate School of Business Administration|graduate business school]] (Ranked 13th), [[University of Virginia School of Nursing|nursing school]] (Ranked 15th), [[University of Virginia School of Medicine|medical school]] (Ranked 20th in Primary Care and 22nd in Research).&lt;ref&gt;[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools U.S. News Top Graduate Schools]&lt;/ref&gt;  The University is one of the eight original [[Public Ivies|Public Ivy]] universities, which recognizes top public research universities in the United States.

The University is notable in [[History of the United States|U.S. history]] for being the first educational institution to offer academic programs in disciplines now common, such as [[astronomy]] and [[philosophy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Its [[University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] was the first engineering school in the United States to be part of a comprehensive university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.che.virginia.edu/history.html Chemical Engineering - SEAS History]&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the University of Virginia is incorporated as ''The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia''.

The early [[Board of Visitors]] was filled with former Presidents of the United States: [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and [[James Monroe]]. Although Jefferson undertook all planning of the University, the land underneath it was once a farm belonging to Monroe.  His farmhouse was located on [[Brown College at Monroe Hill|Monroe Hill]], which today is the site of one of three undergraduate residential colleges.

[[Secret societies at the University of Virginia|Historical secret societies]] such as [[Seven Society|Seven]], [[IMP Society|IMP]], and [[Z Society|Z]] are very active; as are two rival literary and debating societies, the [[Jefferson Literary and Debating Society|Jefferson Society]] and [[Washington Literary Society and Debating Union|Washington Society]]. Many students live in [[residential college]]s such as [[Brown College at Monroe Hill|Brown College]], [[Hereford College]] and the International Residential College. Yet some aspects of student life are more recognizable to those familiar with other universities across the nation, as there are also [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]], and the athletic teams participate in the highly competitive [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]. Notably the University has had the highest [[African American]] graduation rate of all public universities in the United States for 15 years running. Achieving a graduation rate of 87% for its black students, UVA topped its nearest public rival, the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], by 11 percentage points in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;JHBE Weekly Bulletin: [http://www.jbhe.com/latest/index011410.html Once Again, the University of Virginia Has the Highest Black Student Graduation Rate of Any Flagship State University in the Nation].14 January 2010.

==History==
On January 18, 1800, [[Thomas Jefferson]], the [[Vice President of the United States]], alluded to plans for a new college in a letter written to British scientist [[Joseph Priestley]]: &quot;We wish to establish in the upper country of Virginia, and more centrally for the State, a University on a plan so broad and liberal and modern, as to be worth patronizing with the public support, and be a temptation to the youth of other States to come and drink of the cup of knowledge and fraternize with us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wish&quot;&gt;Noble E. Cunningham, Jr., ''In Pursuit of Reason: The Life of Thomas Jefferson'', p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802, then serving as [[President of the United States]], Jefferson wrote to artist [[Charles Willson Peale]] that his concept of the new university would be &quot;on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peale&quot;&gt;Alf J. Mapp, Jr., ''Thomas Jefferson: Passionate Pilgrim'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia was already home to one university, the [[The College of William &amp; Mary|College of William &amp; Mary]], but Jefferson lost confidence in his ''alma mater'', partly because of its religious biases and lack of education in the sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;bias&quot;&gt;Phillips Russell, ''Jefferson, Champion of the Free Mind'', p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Jefferson flourished under the tutelage of W&amp;M professors [[William Small]] and [[George Wythe]], his concerns with the College became great enough by 1800 that he wrote: &quot;We have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bias2&quot;&gt;''Circular of Information'', State Board of Education, United States Bureau of Education. Washington (State) Superintendent of Public Instruction. Published by State Board of Education, 1888. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, he began planning a university more aligned with his educational ideals.&lt;ref&gt;''Higher Education in Transition: A History of American Colleges and Universities'' by John Seiler Brubacher, Willis Rudy. Published by Transaction Publishers, 1997.  p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jm5.gif|thumb|left|150px|The University of Virginia stands on land once owned by President [[James Monroe]], who sold the land when he moved into the [[White House]].]]

The University of Virginia stands on land purchased in 1788 by an [[American Revolutionary War]] veteran (and eventual fifth [[President of the United States]]), [[James Monroe]]. The farmland just outside [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] was purchased from Monroe by the Board of Visitors of what was then ''Central College'' in 1817; Monroe was beginning the first of his own two terms in the [[White House]]. Guided by Jefferson, the school laid its first building's cornerstone later in 1817 and the Commonwealth of Virginia would charter the new university on January 25, 1819.

In the presence of [[James Madison]], the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] toasted Jefferson as &quot;father&quot; of the ''University of Virginia'' at the school's inaugural banquet in 1824. The University's first classes met in March 1825. Other universities of the day allowed only three choices of specialization: Medicine, Law, and Religion, but under Jefferson's guidance, the University of Virginia became the first in the United States to allow specializations in such diverse fields as [[Astronomy]], [[Architecture]], [[Botany]], [[Philosophy]], and [[Political Science]]. Jefferson explained, &quot;This institution will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reason&quot;&gt;[[Dumas Malone]], ''Jefferson and His Time: The Sage of Monticello'', p. 417-418.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chapel at the Univ. of VA IMG 4250.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The non-denominational chapel near the Rotunda of the university was established in 1890, beyond the original scope of Jefferson's plans.]] 

An even more controversial direction was taken for the new university based on a daring vision that higher education should be completely separated from religious doctrine. One of the largest construction projects in North America up to that time, the new Grounds were centered upon a library (then housed in [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|the Rotunda]]) rather than a churchâfurther distinguishing it from peer universities of the United States, most of which were still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular religion or another.&lt;ref name=&quot;sem&quot;&gt;[[Joseph J. Ellis]], ''American Sphinx'', p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson even went so far as to ban the teaching of Theology altogether. In a letter to [[Thomas Cooper (US politician)|Thomas Cooper]] in October 1814, Jefferson stated, &quot;a professorship of theology should have no place in our institution&quot; and, true to form, the University never had a Divinity school or department, and was established independent of any religious sect. Replacing the then-standard specialization in Religion, the University undertook groundbreaking specializations in scientific subjects such as Astronomy and Botany. (However, today the University does maintain one of the highest-rated Religious Studies departments in the U.S. and a non-denominational chapel, notably absent from Jefferson's original plans, was constructed in 1890 near the Rotunda.)

Jefferson was intimately involved in the University, hosting until his death Sunday dinners at his [[Monticello]] home for faculty and students. So taken with the import of what he viewed the University's foundations and potential to be, and counting it amongst his greatest accomplishments, Jefferson insisted his grave mention only his status as author of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], and father of the University of Virginia. Thus, he eschewed mention of his Presidency and national accomplishments in favor of being remembered for the newly established university.

[[Image:Lawn.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[The Lawn]] during winter, with tracks through the snow. At center is the [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|Rotunda]], which was the original library building at the head of Jefferson's Academical Village.]]

In 1826, the nation's fourth President [[James Madison]] became Rector of the University of Virginia, at the same time America's fifth President [[James Monroe]] made his home on the Grounds (at [[Brown College at Monroe Hill|Monroe Hill]]) and was a member of the Board of Visitors. Both former Presidents stayed at the University until their deaths in the 1830s.

The [[University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]] opened in 1836, making it the first engineering school in the United States to be attached to a comprehensive university.

At the onset of the [[American Civil War]], the University of Virginia was the largest in the [[Southern United States]] and second nationwide only to [[Harvard University]] in its scope.&lt;ref name=&quot;1860size&quot;&gt;''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]'', [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9075476 University of Virginia], retrieved June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many other colleges in the South, the University was kept open throughout the conflict, an especially remarkable feat with its state being the site of more battles than any other. In March 1865, Union General [[George Armstrong Custer]] marched troops into Charlottesville, whereupon faculty and community leaders convinced him to spare the University. Though [[Union Army|Union troops]] camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer's men left four days later without bloodshed and the University was able to return to its educational routines.

Jefferson, ever the skeptic of central authority and bureaucracy, had originally decided the University of Virginia would have no President. Rather, this power was to be shared by a Rector and a [[Board of Visitors]]. As the nineteenth century waned, it became obvious this arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks that had become necessary to support the growing University.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. This was obvious to whom, and why?|date=July 2011}}

[[Image:Thomas-Jefferson.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Father of the University of Virginia, [[Thomas Jefferson]] was the first and only [[President of the United States]] to found an institution of higher learning.]]

In 1904, [[Edwin Alderman]] resigned as President of [[Tulane University]] to take the same position at the University of Virginia. As the University's first President, he embarked on a number of reforms for both the University and the state of Virginia's public educational systems in general. A reform specific to the University of Virginia was one of the first school-sponsored [[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]] programs in all of higher learning and, though primitive by today's standards, it included a loan provision for those &quot;needy young men&quot; who were unable to pay. Initially controversial and opposed by many at what had become a very traditional school, Alderman's progressive ideas stood the test of time. He remains the longest-tenured President in the University's history, having served for twenty-six years until his death in 1931. Alderman Library, a popular landmark among today's students, is his namesake.

During [[World War II]], Virginia was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;mercer-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ogyYUQRxuroC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=%22v-12+program%22+utah&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0XBFQbJE7V&amp;sig=s8w4toh9UXRcyFTSz-wVTMx3ou0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vjKJTqrRA6OtsQLL7cS9Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22v-12%20program%22%20utah&amp;f=false |title=Remaking Dixie: the impact of World War II on the American South |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |last=Neil R. |first=McMillen  |accessdate=October 2, 2011 |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winner [[William Faulkner]] became writer-in-residence at the University in 1957, keeping open office hours until his death in 1962. He was also a lecturer at the school, as well as taking the title &quot;Consultant on American Literature to the Alderman Library&quot;. Faulkner had a large collection of his manuscripts and typesets given to and made available (the request reaffirmed by his wife and daughter) at the library upon his death.

In 2004, resulting from a stark decrease in state support, the University of Virginia became the first public university in the United States to receive more of its funding from private sources than from the state with which it is associated. Thanks to a Charter initiative that passed the [[Virginia General Assembly]] and was signed into law by then-[[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[Mark Warner]] in 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;Virginia restructuring&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/restructuring/legislation.html |title=Legislation |work=Restructuring Higher Education |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Universityâand any other public universities in the state that choose to do so (currently [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] and [[The College of William &amp; Mary|William &amp; Mary]])âwill have greater autonomy over its own affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Virginia restructuring FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginia.edu/restructuring/legislation.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) |work=Restructuring Higher Education |publisher=University of Virginia |accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Jm4.gif|150px|thumb|left|President [[James Madison]] served as the second Rector of the University of Virginia until his death in 1836.]]

Also in 2004, the 100th anniversary of Alderman becoming President, the University announced the AccessUVa financial aid program. This program guarantees the University will meet 100% of a student's demonstrated need. It also provides low-income students (up to 200% of the poverty line &amp;ndash; as of 2009, about [[Poverty threshold#National poverty lines|$44,000]] for a family of four) with full grants to cover all of their educational needs, and it caps the level of need-based loans for all other students. This program is the first to guarantee full grants to students of low-income families at any public university in the United States.

In 1944 the [[University of Mary Washington|Mary Washington College]] in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] became the Women's Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Division of the University of Virginia. Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as [[undergraduate]]s, except in the education and nursing schools. In 1970, the Charlottesville campus became fully co-educational and in 1972 Mary Washington became an independent state university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umw.edu/publications/catalog_cgps/introduction/history_development_univer.php University of Mary Washington: History and Development of the University.]&lt;/ref&gt; All-[[White American|white]] until 1950 and generally all-male, the University of Virginia is now very diverse.  The story of the racial integration of the University is movingly told in [[Sarah Patton Boyle]]'s classic book ''The Desegregated Heart'' (1962).  Boyle was a faculty wife and civil rights activist who worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. (He singled her out for praise in his famous &quot;Letter From Birmingham Jail&quot;.)''' '''The makeup of the Class of 2008 was 10% [[African American]], 14% [[Asian American]], 5% [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]], 5% Other and 5% [[International student|International]]; over one-third of the members of the class reported themselves as being non-white. Approximately eighty-five percent of the University's entering Class of 2009 were ranked in the top 10% of their graduating high school class and 56% are female.'''

Today, minority students are particularly successful at the University of Virginia. According to the Fall 2005 issue of ''Journal of Blacks in Higher Education'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jbhe.com/news_views/49_blackenrollment_publicivies.html ''Comparing Black Enrollments at the Public Ivies''. The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; the University &quot;has the highest [[African American|black]] student graduation rate of the [[Public Ivy|Public Ivies]] at 86 percent.&quot; The journal goes on to state that &quot;by far the most impressive is the University of Virginia with its high black student graduation rate and its small racial difference in graduation rates.&quot;

The University of Virginia joined with [[Harvard University]] and [[Princeton University]] as the three universities announced the end of their [[Early Decision]] and [[Early Action]] programs in September 2006, stating that such policies limit poor and [[middle class]] students from competing on an equal footing with applicants from rich families.&lt;ref name=&quot;EarlyDecision1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Throughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praise for its unique [[Jeffersonian architecture]]. In January 1895, less than a year before the Great Rotunda Fire, ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that the design of the University of Virginia &quot;was incomparably the most ambitious and monumental architectural project that had or has yet been conceived in this century&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;schuyler&quot;&gt;''Architectural Record,&quot; 4 (JanuaryâMarch 1895), pp. 351-353&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States Bicentennial]] issue of their ''AIA Journal'', the [[American Institute of Architects]] called it &quot;the proudest achievement of American architecture in the past 200 years&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aia&quot;&gt;''AIA Journal'', 65 (July 1976), p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the University of Virginia remains an architectural landmark and popular tourist destination.

The University, together with Jefferson's home at [[Monticello]], is a [[World Heritage Site]], one of only three modern sites so listed in the [[U.S. state|50 states]], the others being the [[Statue of Liberty]] and [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]]. It was the first collegiate campus worldwide to be awarded the designation.

Jefferson's original architectural design revolves around the &quot;Academical Village&quot;, and that name remains in use today to describe both the specific area of [[The Lawn]], a grand, terraced green space surrounded by residential and academic buildings, the gardens, [[The Range]], and the larger University surrounding it. The principal building of the design, [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|The Rotunda]] ([http://www.virginia.edu/cgi-local/rcamcgi?Q RotundaCam]), stands at the north end of the Lawn, and is the most recognizable symbol of the University. It is half the height and width of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]], which was the primary inspiration for the building. The Lawn and the Rotunda were the model for many similar designs of &quot;centralized green areas&quot; at universities across the country.

Most notably designed by inspiration of the Rotunda and Lawn are the expansive green spaces headed by Rotunda-like buildings built at [[Duke University]] in 1892, [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1902, [[Rice University]] in 1910, Dallas Hall, the central building at [[Southern Methodist University]] (1912), Peabody College of [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1915, the Green at the [[University of Delaware]] in 1916, Killian Court at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1916 (which was coincidentally founded by [[William Barton Rogers]], who immediately prior to founding MIT was a [[Natural philosophy|Natural Philosophy]] professor at the University of Virginia for 19&amp;nbsp;years), the &quot;Grand Auditorium&quot; of [[Tsinghua University]] in [[Beijing]] built in 1917, the campus of [[Yale Divinity School]] (the Sterling Quad, 1932), and, indeed, the new grounds of the University's own [[Darden Graduate School of Business Administration|Darden School of Business]] (designed by Robert A.M. Stern).

Flanking both sides of the Rotunda and extending down the length of the Lawn are ten Pavilions interspersed with student rooms. Each has its own classical architectural style, as well as its own walled garden separated by Jeffersonian Serpentine walls. These walls are called &quot;serpentine&quot; because they run a sinusoidal course, one that lends strength to the wall and allows for the wall to be only one brick thick, one of many innovations by which Jefferson attempted to combine aesthetics with utility. [[Frank E. Grizzard, Jr.]], a former scholar at the University, has written the definitive book on the original academic buildings at the University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/jefferson/grizzard Grizzard, Frank E.''Documentary history of the construction of the buildings at the University of Virginia, 1817-1828''. University of Virginia Libraries. 1996-2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson financed the building of the University through personal loans from James Monroe and General John Hartwell Cocke, II.  Monroe, Cocke, and Jefferson each put up 1/3 of the money to procure the land and build the initial buildings.  Gen. Cocke was a General in the War of 1812, a local plantation owner, and friend of Thomas Jefferson.  He owned Bremo Plantation, located southwest of Charlottesville near where Bremo Bluff, VA is today.   These loans were never repaid by Jefferson. 

On October 27, 1895, the Rotunda burned to a shell because of an electrical fire that started in the Rotunda Annex, a long multi-story structure built in 1853 to house additional classrooms. The electrical fire was no doubt assisted by the unfortunate help of overzealous faculty member [[William Holding Echols|William &quot;Reddy&quot; Echols]], who attempted to save it by throwing roughly 100&amp;nbsp;pounds (45&amp;nbsp;kg) of [[dynamite]] into the main fire in the hopes that the blast would separate the burning Annex from Mr. Jefferson's own Rotunda. His last-ditch effort ultimately failed. (Perhaps ironically, one of the University's main honors student programs is named for him.) University officials swiftly approached celebrity architect [[Stanford White]] to rebuild the Rotunda. White took the charge further, disregarding Mr. Jefferson's design and redesigning the Rotunda interior &amp;mdash; making it two floors instead of three, adding three buildings to the foot of the Lawn, and designing a President's House. He did omit rebuilding the Rotunda Annex, the remnants of which were used as fill and to create part of the modern-day Rotunda's northern-facing plaza. The classes formerly occupying the Annex were now moved to the South Lawn in White's new buildings.

Although undoubtedly useful to the University in providing additional classroom space, and not unattractive, if pedestrian in comparison to the Jeffersonian Pavilions, the White buildings have the effect of closing off the sweeping perspective, as originally conceived by Jefferson, down the Lawn across open countryside toward the distant mountains. The White buildings at the foot of the Lawn effectively create a huge &quot;quadrangle&quot;, albeit one far grander than any traditional college quadrangle at the [[University of Cambridge]] or [[University of Oxford]].

In concert with the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976, Stanford White's changes to the Rotunda were removed and the building was returned to Jefferson's original design. Renovated according to original sketches and historical photographs, a three-story Rotunda opened on Jefferson's birthday, April 13, 1976.

Though student enrollment has grown well beyond the original Lawn facilities, the University further distinguishes itself by extending the original Academical Village ideal with two exclusively First-Year (freshman) living areas: The Old Dorms (Bonnycastle, Dabney, Echols, Emmet, Hancock, Humphreys, Kent, Lefevre, Metcalf, Page), located on [[McCormick Road (UVA)|McCormick Road]], and The New Dorms (Cauthen, Courtenay, Dunglison, Dunnington, Fitzhugh, Kellogg, Lile, Maupin, Tuttle, Webb, Woody), adjacent to [[Scott Stadium]], both situated wholly on Grounds and considered integral to establishing peer discourse. The common bonding experience proves such a fixture to the University experience, students often identify themselves by individual &quot;Old&quot; or &quot;New&quot; dormitory. First-Year living areas also include [[Hereford College]], [[International Residential College]], and [[Brown College at Monroe Hill]].

In 2001, [[John Kluge]] donated {{convert|7,378|acre|km2}} of additional lands to the University. Kluge desired the core of the land to be developed by the University, and the surrounding land to be sold to fund an endowment supporting the core. A large part of the gift was soon sold to musician [[Dave Matthews]], of the [[Dave Matthews Band]], to be utilized in an [[organic farming]] project. It is unknown what the University will do with its &quot;core&quot; portion of the land.

The [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] maintains the roads through the University grounds as [[State Route 302 (Virginia)|State Route 302]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.virginiadot.org/info/resources/route-index-07012003.pdf Virginia Route Index]|239&amp;nbsp;KB}}, revised July 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 1940, U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] came to the University's Memorial Gymnasium to watch his son [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr.|Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr.]] graduate, and to give the commencement address. Instead, &quot;in this university founded by the first great American teacher of democracy&quot; he made his impromptu &quot;Stab in the Back&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FDR&quot;&gt;[ftp://webstorage2.mcpa.virginia.edu/library/nara/fdr/audiovisual/speeches/fdr_1940_0610.html Roosevelt, Franklin D.

Nearly two decades later, in 1958, Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] visited and spoke in the same space with brothers [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[Ted Kennedy]], the latter of whom was managing JFK's 1958 Senatorial re-election campaign from his dormitory at the University of Virginia.

In the early 1960s, civil rights leaders [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], &lt;&lt;link:0&gt;&gt;, [[Aaron Henry]], [[Bayard Rustin]], and others spoke at the University under the sponsorship of the Virginia Council on Human Relations, a student organization which presented speakers on Grounds who opposed the state's prevailing policy of racial segregation.  [[John Lewis (American politician)|John Lewis]], Chairman of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] spoke in 1965 while his head was still bandaged from a police beating he received leading the [[Selma to Montgomery marches#The First March, &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;|first march from Selma]].

Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech at Old Cabell Hall in 1963 met with no resistance of any kind among the student body or administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dabney |first=Virginius |authorlink=Virginius Dabney |url=http://repo.lib.virginia.edu:18080/fedora/get/uva-lib:179274/uva-lib-bdef:100/getFullView |title=Mr. Jefferson's University: A History |location=[[Charlottesville]] |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=081390904X |page=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called for a doubling of black registrations at universities in the South. African-American enrollment has since been increased tenfold at the University.  Five years later in 1968, when King was shot, the Rotunda flag was flown at [[half-mast]] and then-President of the University [[Edgar F. Shannon, Jr.|Edgar Shannon, Jr.]] led a U.Va. memorial service in Cabell Hall.

To commemorate the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976, Britain's [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] strolled the Lawn and lunched in the Dome Room of the Rotunda, one of five American sites she publicly visited.

The [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]], [[Archbishop]] [[Desmond Tutu]], and several other Nobel Peace laureates stayed on Grounds for one week in 1998 while attending the University's historic Nobel Laureates Conference.

When the Virginia Legislature's Committee of Schools and Colleges was reconsidering it in 1845, then-U.Va. professor and future [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] founder [[William Barton Rogers]] wrote, &quot;[T]he legislators of the University have, we think, wisely made their highest academic honor&amp;mdash;that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia&amp;mdash;the genuine test of diligent and successful literary training, and, disdaining such literary almsgiving, have firmly barred the door against the demands of spurious merit and noisy popularity.&quot; When MIT was chartered in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1861, Rogers carried the U.Va. policy through to the new institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =  | url = http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/commdegrees.html | title = No honorary degrees is an MIT tradition going back to ...

These e-texts are open to anyone and, {{As of|2002|lc=on}}, were receiving 37,000 daily visits (compared to 6,000 daily visitors to the physical libraries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Electronic Center at UVa Library | work = | publisher = Digital Scholarship Services | date = | url = http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/ | doi = | accessdate = 2006-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Virginia is a member of a consortium engaged in the construction and operation of the [[Large Binocular Telescope]] in the [[Mount Graham International Observatory]] of the [[Pinaleno Mountains]] of southeastern [[Arizona]]. It is also a member of both the Astrophysical Research Consortium, which operates telescopes at [[Apache Point Observatory]] in [[New Mexico]], and the [[Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy]] which operates the [[National Optical Astronomy Observatory]], the [[Gemini Observatory]] and the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]]. The University of Virginia hosts the headquarters of the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]], which operates the [[Green Bank Telescope]] in [[West Virginia]] and the [[Very Large Array]] radio telescope made famous in the [[Carl Sagan]] television documentary ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]'' and film ''[[Contact (film)|Contact]]''. The North American [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] Science Center is also located at the Charlottesville NRAO site.

UVA also hosts the [[Rare Book School]], a non-profit organization that studies the history of books and printing. The University is one of 60 elected members of the [[Association of American Universities]], and the only member representing the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is the United States' sole member of [[Universitas 21]], an international consortium of research-intensive universities. On May 14, 2007, University President John Casteen was named Chairman of the Board of the organization.

===Graduate placement===
In 2003, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' studied the undergraduate backgrounds of entering students at &quot;elite&quot; graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ranking the Colleges... | publisher = Wall Street Journal | url = http://www.wsjclassroomedition.com/pdfs/wsj_college_092503.pdf | format = PDF | date = 2003-09-23 |accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Virginia with 82 placements (2.6% of class) placed 33rd overall and third among all state-supported universities in elite graduate placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How State Schools Did | publisher = Wall Street Journal | url = http://www.wsjclassroomedition.com/pdfs/wsj_college2_092503.pdf | format = PDF | date = 2003-09-23 | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  No other state university on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Seaboard]] had greater than one-third the number of placements as the University of Virginia (e.g., [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] had 26 placements, [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] had 20).

==Faculty==
[[Image:KathrynThornton.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Kathryn C. Thornton]], Associate Dean for Graduate Programs at the [[University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]]]]

The University of Virginia possesses a distinguished faculty, including a Nobel Laureate, 25 Guggenheim fellows, 26 Fulbright fellows, six National Endowment for the Humanities fellows, two Presidential Young Investigator Award winners, three Sloan award winners, three Packard Foundation Award winners, and a winner of the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/10_04_2005/marshall_barry.html U.Va. Top News Daily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The University's faculty were particularly instrumental in the evolution of Internet networking and connectivity. Physics professor James McCarthy was the lead academic liaison to the government in the establishment of [[Suranet|SURANET]], and the University has also participated in [[Arpanet|ARPANET]], [[Abilene Network|Abilene]], [[Internet2]], and [[National LambdaRail|Lambda Rail]]. On March 19, 1986 the University's [[domain name]], &lt;tt&gt;Virginia.edu&lt;/tt&gt;, became the first registration under the &lt;tt&gt;[[.edu]]&lt;/tt&gt; [[top-level domain]] originating from the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = University of Virginia - virginia.edu | publisher = Alexa Internet, Inc. | url = http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=virginia.edu&amp;url=virginia.edu | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faculty were originally housed in the [[The Lawn|Academical Village]] among the students, serving as both instructors and advisors, continuing on to include the McCormick Road Old Dorms, though this has been phased out in favor of undergraduate student resident advisors (RAs). Several of the faculty, however, continue the University tradition of living on Grounds, either on the Lawn in the various Pavilions, or as fellows at one of three residential colleges ([[Brown College at Monroe Hill]], [[Hereford College]], and the International Residential College).

Some of the University of Virginia's faculty have become well-known national personalities during their time in [[Charlottesville]].  [[Larry Sabato]] has, according to ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'', become the most cited professor in the country by national and regional news organizations, both on the Internet and in print.&lt;ref name=Sabato&gt;[http://www.centerforpolitics.org/about/staff_sabato.htm Center For Politics website]. Retrieved June 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Julian Bond]], a lecturer in the Corcoran Department of History since 1990, has been the Chairman of the [[NAACP]] since 1998. Professor Bond was also chosen to be the moderator of the 1998 Nobel Laureates Conferences, which included His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and other living winners of the Nobel Peace Prize.  [[Media Studies]] and Law professor [[Siva Vaidhyanathan]], an expert in [[copyright law]] and Internet issues, moved from [[New York University]] to the University of Virginia in 2007. Spanish professor David Gies received the [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] from King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginia.edu/uvatoday/newsRelease.php?id=3421 Spanish Professor David T. Gies is Awarded One of Spain's Highest Honors]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2002, the ''[[Cavalier Daily]]'' student newspaper has posted faculty compensation online annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Where Your Money Goes | work = [[Cavalier Daily]] | url = http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2008/apr/14/where-your-money-goes/ | date=2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial strength==
===Endowment===
Managed by the University of Virginia Investment Management Company, and with [[United States dollar|$]]5.24 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] as of August 4, 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;nacubo-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dailyprogress.com/news/2011/may/21/uva-endowment-bounces-back-steep-losses-ar-1055668/ |title=UVa endowment bounces back from steep losses |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the University of Virginia has a per capita endowment of $255,000 per student; this is the largest per capita endowment of any public university in the United States. Considering public university endowments across the country, the [[University of Michigan]] ($122,000) is second to U.Va. among national publics in per capita endowment funds. Both are in the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment#Certain institutions by endowment growth|top 5 for recent growth rates]] nationwide.

When compared to other public universities in its home state, the per-student endowment at the University of Virginia is several times larger than its nearest competitors, [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] ($80,000 per student) and [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]] ($16,000). It is also several times larger than the highest among flagship institutions of nearby states, [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] ($55,000) and [[University of Maryland, College Park]] ($8,600).

===Triple-A credit rating===
The University of Virginia is one of only two public universities in the U.S. that has a [[bond credit rating|Triple-A credit rating]] from all three major credit rating agencies, along with the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/article/UVAA04_20090403-223316/248738/ U.Va. poised to issue $300 million in bonds to finance campus construction projects] &amp;ndash; ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This allows it to borrow money and fund projects with the best possible conditions and terms.

==Athletics==
{{main|Virginia Cavaliers}}
[[Image:Chris Long Gator Bowl 2008.jpg|right|175px|thumb|[[Chris Long (American football)|Chris Long]], #2 overall pick of the [[2008 NFL Draft]]]]
The University of Virginia's athletics program competes in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] (and the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] for [[American football|football]]), and has been a member of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] since 1953. The current Athletic Director at Virginia is [[Craig Littlepage]]. The [[Virginia Cavaliers]], also called &quot;Wahoos&quot; or &quot;Hoos&quot;, have won 20 recognized national championships, 15 of them since 1980. Virginia has won multiple national titles in five different sports, including three men's sports ([[lacrosse]], 6; [[association football|soccer]], 6; and [[boxing]], 2) and two women's sports ([[women's lacrosse|lacrosse]], 3; and [[cross country running|cross country]], 2). It also holds a national championship in [[track and field]]. The men's [[college basketball]] team has won either the ACC regular season (1981, 1982, 1983, 1995, 2007) or [[ACC Tournament]] (1976) titles six times and has been to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]] twice, while the women's squad has been three times.

The [[Virginia Cavaliers football|football team]] won a share of the ACC Championship in both 1989 and 1995 (both before the conference had a championship game). After never reaching a bowl before 1984, the team has played in 17 bowl games since. The program is also notable for its recent high draft picks in the [[National Football League]], including the [[2006 NFL Draft#Round one|#4 overall pick]] of 2006, [[D'Brickashaw Ferguson]], and the [[2008 NFL Draft#First round|#2 overall pick]] of 2008, [[Chris Long (American football)|Chris Long]].  The program is a party to three major rivalry games in the conference: the longest series in the ACC, the [[South's Oldest Rivalry]] with [[North Carolina Tar Heels|North Carolina]]; the [[Commonwealth Cup]] with [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech]] (part of the greater [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry]]); and the [[Maryland-Virginia rivalry|Beltway Brawl]] with [[Maryland Terrapins|Maryland]]. While the Cavaliers have played UNC more times (114) than any other rival, all of these  opponents &amp;ndash; North Carolina, Virginia Tech, and Maryland &amp;ndash; each list Virginia as their schools' longest-standing football rivals.

In 2006, the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|men's lacrosse team]] won its fourth [[NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship]], and sixth including the pre-tournament era. In the title game, Virginia defeated [[UMass Minutemen|UMass]] 15-7 in front of a record crowd of 47,062 at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in [[Philadelphia]], the first lacrosse crowd to surpass the crowd size of the men's basketball Final Four and the largest crowd to witness any [[:Category:NCAA Championships|NCAA Championship]] during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Virginia Claims National Title, and a Victory for Lacrosse | publisher = The New York Times | date = May 30, 2006 | page = D5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished the season a perfect 17&amp;ndash;0, the best record in NCAA lacrosse history.

[[Image:ClaudioReyna USMNT 20060511.jpg|175px|left|thumb|[[Claudio Reyna]] won 3 national championships at Virginia and was later captain of the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA team]] for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]]. Dubbed &quot;[[Captain America]]&quot; by his British fans, he was named [[Soccer America College Team of the Century#Player of the Century|Player of the Century]] by ''[[Soccer America]]''.]]

The new [[John Paul Jones Arena]] opened in the fall of 2006 for [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|men's]] and women's basketball. It seats 14,593 fans, making it the third largest on-campus basketball facility in the ACC and the largest arena not located in a [[List of United States metropolitan areas|major metropolitan area]]. The arena's inaugural year witnessed the Virginia men's basketball team's first place finish in the ACC.

[[Davenport Field]], where the [[Virginia Cavaliers baseball|UVa baseball team]] plays, is also new, opening in 2002. In [[Brian O'Connor (baseball coach)|Brian O'Connor]]'s first 4 seasons at the helm after being made the head baseball coach in July 2003, the team has averaged 44 wins per year and become a nationally-ranked power. The team has led the ACC in team [[earned run average|ERA]] for 4 consecutive years.  In 2009, the baseball team won a place in the [[College World Series]] for the first time.

The soccer teams are also national powers, with men's soccer having won 6 national championships to date including its most recent in December 2009. The women's team is regularly ranked in the top 10 nationally. The teams play their home matches at [[KlÃ¶ckner Stadium]], the largest soccer stadium in the ACC. The men's team has been invited to the NCAA Tournament for 26 consecutive years and made the College Cup many times. Former Coach [[Bruce Arena]] has coached the US national team and currently coaches the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] in [[Major League Soccer]].

The Aquatics and Fitness Center ([http://www.virginia.edu/rcam/afc.html webcam]) has been popular among University students for working out and swimming since its opening in Fall 1996, and it is also where the [[swimming (sport)|Swimming]] &amp; [[Diving]] teams compete in home meets. The men's swimming and diving team won 8 consecutive ACC Championships between 1999 and 2006.  The women's swimming team won its fourth consecutive ACC Championship on February 19, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theacc.com/sports/c-swim/recaps/021911aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also winning consecutive ACC titles has been the men's tennis team, which has won 4 consecutive regular season ACC Championships. Playing their home matches at the [[Sheridan Snyder Tennis Center]], the men's tennis team had their best season ever in 2007, finishing with a 30-4 record and a #2 national ranking.  [[Somdev Devvarman]] became the first ACC player in conference history to win the NCAA Singles Championship, which he won in two consecutive years. In addition, the tennis team beat Ohio State for the 2008 National Indoor Tennis Championships, 4-1.

Now that [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech]] has joined the ACC, the [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry]] has been strengthened across a number of sports. This rivalry between the University and its larger neighbor to the southwest is followed statewide. UVA's athletic teams have bested the [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Hokies]] through the years in [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry#All-time and ACC series results|many of the major sports]]. The two universities also faced off in the [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry#Commonwealth Challenge|Commonwealth Challenge]] between 2005 and 2007, with the Cavaliers routing the Hokies in each Challenge: 14.5 to 7.5 in 2005-2006 and 14 to 8 in 2006-2007. The competition was then dropped out of sensitivity following the [[Virginia Tech massacre]].

===Fight song===
[[The Cavalier Song]] is the official fight song of the University of Virginia. The song was a result of a contest held in 1923 by the University. The Cavalier Song, with lyrics by Lawrence Haywood Lee, Jr. and music by [[Fulton Lewis|Fulton Lewis, Jr.]], was selected as the winner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginiasports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17800&amp;KEY=&amp;ATCLID=1134444 Traditions - University of Virginia Cavaliers Official Athletic Site - VirginiaSports.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the second half of the song is played during sporting events.  Until the 2008 football season, the entire fight song could be heard during the [[Cavalier Marching Band]]'s entrance at home football games.

==Student life==

Student life at the University of Virginia is marked by a number of unique traditions. The campus of the University is referred to as &quot;the Grounds.&quot;  Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors are instead called first-, second-, third-, and fourth-years in order to reflect Jefferson's belief that learning is a never-ending process, rather than one to be completed within four years. Also, students do not &quot;graduate&quot; from the University; instead, they &quot;take&quot; their degrees. Professors are traditionally addressed as &quot;Mr.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot; instead of &quot;Doctor&quot; (although medical doctors are the exception and are called &quot;Doctor&quot;) in deference to Thomas Jefferson's desire to have an equality of ideas, discriminated by merit and unburdened by title.

In 2005, the University was named &quot;Hottest for Fitness&quot; by ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = America's 25 Hot Schools | publisher = [[Newsweek]] |date=August 2004 (2005 edition) | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5626574/site/newsweek/}}&lt;/ref&gt; due in part to 94% of its students using one of the four indoor athletics facilities. Particularly popular is the Aquatics and Fitness Center, situated across the street from the Alderman Dorms.

Volunteerism at the University is centered in [http://scs.student.virginia.edu/~madison/ Madison House], which offers numerous opportunities to serve others. Among the numerous programs offered are tutoring, housing improvement, and an organization called Hoos Against Hunger, which gives leftover food from restaurants to the homeless of Charlottesville, rather than allowing it to be discarded.

A number of [[Secret Societies at the University of Virginia|secret societies at the University]], most notably the [[Seven Society]], [[Z Society]], and [[IMP Society]], have operated for decades, leaving their painted marks on University buildings. Other significant secret societies include [[Eli Banana]], [[Secret societies at the University of Virginia#T.I.L.K.A.|T.I.L.K.A.]], the [[Secret societies at the University of Virginia#Purple Shadows|Purple Shadows]] (who commemorate Jefferson's birthday shortly after dawn on the Lawn each April 13), The Sons of Liberty, and the [[21 Society]]. Not all the secret societies keep their membership unknown, but even those who don't hide their identities generally keep most of their good works and activities far from the public eye.

The student life building on the University of Virginia is called Newcomb Hall. It is home to the Student Activities Center (SAC) and the Media Activities Center (MAC), where student groups can get leadership consulting and use computing and copying resources, as well as several meeting rooms for student groups. [http://www.uvastudentcouncil.com Student Council], the student self-governing body, holds meetings Tuesdays at 6PM in the Newcomb South Meeting Room. Student Council, or &quot;StudCo,&quot; also holds office hours and regular committee meetings in the newly renovated Newcomb Programs and Council (PAC) Room. The PAC also houses the [http://www.uvaupc.com University Programs Council] and [http://www.alumni.virginia.edu Class Councils].
Newcomb basement is home to both the office of the independent student newspaper ''The Declaration'', ''[[The Cavalier Daily]]'', and the Consortium of University Publications.

Student Societies have existed on grounds since the early 19th Century. The [[Jefferson Literary and Debating Society]], founded in 1825, is the second oldest Greek-Lettered organization in the nation (the oldest being the Phi Beta Kappa honor fraternity). It continues to meet every Friday at 7:29 PM in [[Jefferson Hall]].  The [[Washington Literary Society and Debating Union]] also meets every week, and the two organizations often engage in a friendly rivalry. In the days before social fraternities existed and intercollegiate athletics became popular, these Societies were often the focal point of social activity on grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jefferson Society&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several fraternities were later founded at the University of Virginia including [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] (March 1, 1868) and [[Kappa Sigma]] (December 10, 1869). Many of these fraternities are located on [[Rugby Road]].

A national publication's survey recently revealed that U.Va.'s students give their library system higher marks than students at any other school in the United States. The best-known library is Alderman Library for the humanities and social sciences, which contains 10 floors of stacks with many useful study nooks hidden among them. U.Va.'s renowned Small Special Collections Library feature one of the premier collections of American Literature in the country as well as an [[Dunlap broadside|original copy]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. It was in this library in 2006 that Robert Stilling, an English Graduate Student, discovered an unpublished [[Robert Frost]] poem from 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frost-Poem&quot;&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clemons Library, next to Alderman, is a popular study spot. Hundreds of students can be found gathered on its various quiet floors on any given night. Clark Hall, home of the Science &amp; Engineering Library, also scores high marks. One of the notable features of Clark Hall is the Mural Room, decorated by two three-panel murals by Allyn Cox, depicting the Moral Law and the Civil Law. The murals were finished and set in place in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clark Hall Named to Virginia Landmarks Registry,&quot; UVa Today, July 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2006}}, the University and [[Google]] were working on the digitization of selected collections from the library system.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google&quot;&gt;{{cite web

As at many universities, alcohol use is a part of the social life of many undergraduate students at the University.

===Student Safety===
While [[Charlottesville]], which typically registers zero to three murders per year, is generally considered a safe city, students have been involved on both sides of homicides in recent history.

* On March 22, 1986, physiology graduate student Pat Collins disappeared after using an ATM in downtown Charlottesville. He was never found.
* On November 8, 2003, student Andrew Alston stabbed an Albemarle County firefighter to death during a fight on 14th Street. His manslaughter sentence resulted in a jail term of three years, prompting allegations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.readthehook.com/Stories/2004/11/18/coverTheVerdictSisksFamily.html|title=The verdict: Sisk's family speaks out|journal=The Hook|date=November 18, 2004|first=Lisa|last=Provence}}&lt;/ref&gt; of special treatment for students.
* On May 3, 2010 in what has become known as the [[Murder of Yeardley Love|UVA Lacrosse Killing]], 22-year-old UVA [[women's lacrosse]] player Yeardley Love was found unresponsive in her 14th Street apartment. Later that day, former romantic partner and then-current lacrosse player George Huguely was charged with her murder.

===Student Events===

One of the largest events at the University of Virginia is called Springfest. It takes place every year in the spring, and features a large free concert and various inflatables and games.

Another popular event is [[Foxfield Races|Foxfield]], a [[steeplechase]] and social gathering that takes place nearby in [[Albemarle County]] in April, and which is annually attended by thousands of students from the University of Virginia and neighboring colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxfield&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/24000_plus_descend_on_foxfield_for_annual_steeplechase_social_gathering/20967/ |work=Daily Progress |location=Charlottesville |date=2008-04-27 |last=Borden |first=Jeremy |title=24,000-plus descend on Foxfield for annual steeplechase, social gathering }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor System==
&lt;div style=&quot;float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; width: 16.5em; text-align: right; font-size: 1em; font-family: verdana, lucida grande, sans-serif; line-height: normal;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;border:1px solid #999; background:#fff; text-align:left; padding:1em; text-align:left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;'''HONOR PLEDGE'''&lt;/div&gt;
On my honor as a student, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment/examination.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The University of Virginia has an honor code, formally known as the Honor System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Honor Committee | publisher = University of Virginia | url = http://www.virginia.edu/honor/ | date = 2006-12-11 | accessdate = 2007-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Honor code|Honor System]] is entirely student-run and was founded by Virginia students in 1842 after John A. G. Davis, chairman of the faculty and professor of law, who was attempting to resolve a conflict between students, was shot to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;dabney-honor&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Dabney |first=Virginius |authorlink=Virginius Dabney |url=http://repo.lib.virginia.edu:18080/fedora/get/uva-lib:178665/uva-lib-bdef:100/getFullView |title=Mr. Jefferson's University: A History |location=[[Charlottesville]] |publisher=[[University of Virginia Press]] |year=1981 |isbn=081390904X |pages=9â10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the student was expected to hold himself to a gentleman's code of conduct. In the wake of the shooting, law professor [[Henry St. George Tucker, Sr.]] proposed a basic honor pledge as a gesture of confidence in the honor of Virginia students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000398 TUCKER, Henry St. George - Biographical Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times however, the Honor System is composed of only three tenets: a student will not [[lie]], [[cheating|cheat]], or [[theft|steal]]. It extends to all matters academic and personal, and the sole sanction for a confirmed Honor System violation is dismissal from the University. This is called the &quot;single sanction&quot;.

[[Image:Honorsystematuva.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A plaque regarding 150 years of the Honor System, placed on the Lawn in 1992]]
The system is not without its detractors &amp;mdash; it has been criticized because the required severe penalty may prevent more moderate violations from being reported or acted upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Professors Tepid about the Honor System | work = [[Charlottesville Daily Progress]] | url = http://www.dailyprogress.com/cdp/news/local/article/survey_uva_faculty_tepid_about_honor_system/13683/ |last=Kessler |first=Aaron | date = 2006-12-27 | accessdate = 2007-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the system is entirely student run, a change to the Honor Committee constitution could have the effect of ending the single sanction system of punishment. Although students have voted on numerous proposals to weaken or eliminate the single sanction over the past few decades, none has ever succeeded. Support for the honor system has waned in recent years, and in the Spring of 2007 a referendum to limit single sanction failed to pass by the necessary 60% margin after earning only 49.5% of the votes cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Students decide on referenda | work=[[Cavalier Daily]] |last=Madrecki |first=Thomas | url = http://www.cavalierdaily.com/news/2007/mar/01/students-decide-on-referenda/ | date = 2007-03-01 | accessdate = 2008-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the Honor System allows the faculty to do such things as assign timed take-home examinations, and research or studies to be done in a particular way, with the assurance that the strictures placed on the student will be observed. However, no professor is required to extend such courtesies. The student is often required to sign all examinations or assignments with the following pledge: &quot;On my honor as a student, I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment/examination.&quot; The Honor System allows the student to purchase books and supplies on-Grounds upon giving his or her word to pay, and some members of the Charlottesville community accept the word of the student regarding off-Grounds business transactions.

While cheating convictions are relatively rare (24 students were dismissed during the 2003 academic year, and 21 more were dismissed in 2004), one large cheating scandal occurred in 2001. Physics professor and Hereford College Dean Louis Bloomfield, based on a student's complaint, had suspicions that some of his students had copied portions of their term papers from [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] archives in his Introduction to Physics class. After devising a computer program to detect copied phrases of at least six sequential words, over 150 students were accused of plagiarizing or allowing others to plagiarize their work over the previous five semesters. Although over 100 of these students were eventually exonerated, 48 students either admitted guilt or were convicted, and were therefore dismissed from the University. Three of these students had already graduated, and their degrees were subsequently revoked.
