The word ''haveli'' is derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word hawli, meaning  &quot;an enclosed place&quot;. They share similar features with other mansions derived from [[Islamic Architecture]] such as the traditional mansions in Morocco called [[Moroccan Riad|Riads]]

== Mughal Havelis ==

Many of the havelis of India and Pakistan were influenced by [[Islamic architecture|Islamic Persian]], [[Central Asian architecture|Central Asian]] and [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]]. They usually contain a courtyard often with a fountain in the centre. The old cities of in  [[Agra]], [[Lucknow]] and [[Delhi]] in [[India]] and [[Lahore]], [[Multan]], [[Peshawar]], [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]] in [[Pakistan]] have many fine examples of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]-[[Mughal architecture|style]] havelis.

== Rajasthani Havelis ==

The term ''Haveli'' was first applied in Rajasthan by the [[Vaishnava]] sect to refer to their temples in [[Gujarat]]. In the northern part of India havelis for Lord Krishna are prevalent with huge mansion like constructions. The havelis are noted for their [[fresco]]es depicting images of [[god]]s, [[goddess]]es, animals, scenes from the [[Colonial India|British colonization]], and the life stories of Lords [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].

Later on these temple architectures and frescoes were imitated while building huge individual mansions and now the word is popularly recognized with the mansions themselves. Between 1830 and 1930, Marwari's erected &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajasthaninfoline.com/rinfo/marwarih.htm Rajasthan Info Online: Marwaris]&lt;/ref&gt; buildings in their homeland, [[Shekhawati]] and [[Marwar]]. These buildings were called havelis. The Marwaris commissioned artists to paint those buildings which were heavily influenced by the [[Mughal architecture]].

The havelis were status symbols for the Marwaris as well as homes for their extended families, providing security and comfort in seclusion from the outside world. The havelis were to be closed from all sides with one large main gate.

The typical havelis in [[Shekhawati]] consisted of two courtyards â an outer one for the men which serves as an extended threshold, and the inner one, the domain of the women. The largest havelis could have up to three or four courtyards and were two to three stories high. Most of the havelis are empty nowadays or are maintained by a watchman (typically an old man).  These havelis are major attraction for tourists in [[Rajasthan]].

The towns and villages of [[Shekhawati]] are famous for the embellished frescoes on the walls of their grandiose havelis, to the point of becoming popular tourist attractions.

The havelis in and around [[Jaisalmer Fort]](also known as the Golden Fort), situated in [[Jaisalmer]], [[Rajasthan]], of which the three most impressive are Patwon Ki Haveli, Salim Singh Ki Haveli, and Nathmal-Ki Haveli, deserve special mention. These were the elaborate homes of Jaisalmer's rich merchants. The ostentatious carvings etched out in sandstone with infinite detail and then painstakingly pieced together in different patterns each more lavish than the next were commissioned to put on show the owner's status and wealth. Around [[Jaisalmer]], they are typically carved from yellow [[sandstone]].They are often characterized by wall paintings, [[fresco]]es, ''[[jharokha]]s'' (balconies) and archways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajasthan-tourism.org/prime-attractions/havelis-of-jaisalmer.html Havelis Of Jaisalmer]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Patwon Ji ki Haveli'' is the most important and the largest haveli, as it was the very first erected in [[Jaisalmer]]. It is not a single haveli but a cluster of 5 small havelis. The first one in the row is also the most popular one and is also known as Kothari's Patwa Haveli. The first among these was commissioned and constructed in the year 1805 by Guman Chand Patwa, then a rich trader of jewellery and fine brocades, and is the biggest and the most ostentatious. Patwa was a rich man and a renowned trader of his time and he could afford and thus order the construction of separate stories for each of his 5 sons. These were completed in the span of 50 years. All five houses were constructed in the first 60 years of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaisalmer.org.uk/tourist-attractions/havelis/patwon-ki-haveli.html Patwon Ji ki Haveli History]&lt;/ref&gt;
Patwon Ji Ki is renowned for its ornate wall paintings, intricate yellow sandstone-carved ''[[jharokha]]s'' (balconies), gateways and archways. Although the building itself is made from yellow [[sandstone]], the main gateway is brown.
