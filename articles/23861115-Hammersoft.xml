Also known as UT'99, UT GOTY. The soundtrack of this game was done in [[Tracker (music software)|tracker music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unreal.epicgames.com/Music.htm| title=Document about the music in UT'99 from Alexander Brandon| accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, instead of the CD music used in [[Quake II]], which resulted in good quality music and less size. There was never an official soundtrack, but a lot of people obtained it directly from the game (it was in [[Impulse Tracker]] format inside the [http://filext.com/file-extension/umx UMX packages]) and converted it to more popular formats.

The music was done between [[Straylight Productions]] with Alexander &quot;Siren&quot; Brandon at its head, and Michiel Van Den Bos.

UT3 features both music in the Ogg Vorbis format as well as dynamic music of an unknown format. According to UT3's Audio Director [[Mike Larson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music4games.net/Features_Display.aspx?id=192| title=Interview with UT3 Audio Director Mike Larson| accessdate=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, after the more orchestral music of UT2003 and UT2004 it became clear that &quot;an overwhelming majority of users&quot; preferred the original UT music. This, and the wish to make a clear distinction between the UT series and [[Gears of War]] lead to the decision to return to electronica. Most of the tracks are remixes of original UT99 tracks, or feature small samples from UT tracks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liandri.beyondunreal.com/Unreal_music |title=Beyond Unreal: Liandri Archives |accessdate=2009-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the music that can be heard in game or on cutscenes are not present in those 2 CDs; they are reported as &quot;Others&quot;.
