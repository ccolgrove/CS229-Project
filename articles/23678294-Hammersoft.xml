&quot;'''Patron Tequila'''&quot; is a song by [[Paradiso Girls|The Paradiso Girls]], intended to appear on their debut unreleased studio album, ''[[Crazy Horse (The Paradiso Girls album)|Crazy Horse]]''. The song was released as the album's lead single in the United States on April 14, 2009. [[Paradiso Girls|The Paradiso Girls]] have released ''The Remixes'' and ''The Remixes Part 2'' to promote the song.&lt;ref&gt;http://interscope.com/paradisogirls/releases&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==
The song was written and produced by [[Keri Hilson]], [[Lil Jon]] and [[T-Pain]] for Hilson's debut studio album [[In a Perfect World...]] ,however, at the last minute before her album's turn in date, the song was given to the Paradiso Girls. The group recorded the song and made several alterations. Lil Jon's verse was omitted whilst T-Pain was replaced with US female rapper [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]].

The song was released in the US on April 14, 2009 as a CD Single and digital download, along with a release in Canada. The girls will be promoting the song throughout October 2009 in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/ChelseaParadiso/status/4396943829&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://twitter.com/laurenparadiso/status/4373469687&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical Performance==
The song was given mainly positive reviews. Many online sites created a &quot;Who did it better?&quot; poll, comparing The [[The Paradiso Girls|Paradiso Girls]]'s version to [[Keri Hilson]]'s version. The song was named MuuMuse's &quot;summer jam of 2009&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muumuse.com/2009/07/interview-with-the-paradiso-girls.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
The music video, directed by [[Ray Kay]], was shot over a three-day process in May 2009. It opens with a man ([[Andy Samberg]]) purchasing [[Dr. Dre]] headphones from a [[Best Buy]] store after hearing the beat to Patron Tequila through them. Each member of the band is featured in a different location, flirting with the man: Aria on a bus, Chelsea filling her car with gas, Kelly in the gas station shop,and Lauren paying at the checkout and Shar sitting at the bus stop. The girls are also in the club where Eve raps along with Lil Jon. They also dance in front of a white backdrop. Clips are interspersed of the man dreaming about the girls being in the club but coming back to reality every now and again. The video premiered on Yahoo on June,15 2009.

There is an alternative uncensored version of the video containing new scenes and the explicit version of the song.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVvWW0ZiZj4&lt;/ref&gt;
