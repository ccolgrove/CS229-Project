'''Cartoon Network''' is a [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] [[television channel]] created by [[Turner Broadcasting]], a unit of [[Time Warner]] which primarily shows [[animated]] programming. The Philippine version is a branch of Cartoon Network Asia, broadcasting exclusively in the Philippines.

==History==
===September 1, 1995 - August 22, 1999: Checkerboard Era===
Cartoon Network Philippines was formerly part of Cartoon Network Asia. It had started its broadcast in 1995 as the dual-channel [[TCM &amp; Cartoon Network|TNT &amp; Cartoon Network]], operating from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., with [[Turner Classic Movies]] (formerly [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]) taking the remainder of the daily schedule. On 1 July 2001, Cartoon Network Asia became a separate 24-hour channel, with exclusive local feeds for the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking areas like Taiwan, the [[English language|English]]-speaking areas in the Philippines, India, and Australia, the [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-speaking areas in Japan, and the [[Korean language|Korean]]-speaking areas in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyngsat.com/asia3s.html All Cartoon Network Feed on AsiaSat 3s]&lt;/ref&gt; It originally aired only [[List of works produced by Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera cartoons]] such as [[Yogi Bear]], [[Top Cat]], [[The Flintstones]] etc. The channel quickly started to develop though, airing for the first time MGM cartoons ([[Tom and Jerry]], [[Droopy]], and [[Spike and Tyke]]) in 1996, and (after [[Time Warner]]'s purchase of Turner in 1996) Warner Bros shows ([[Looney Tunes]], and several other Looney Tunes related cartoons) in 1997. In 1998, Cartoon Network started to air its first original shows ([[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]] and [[The Moxy Show]]), however [[The Moxy Show]] was soon cancelled.

===August 22, 1999 - September 30, 2005: Powerhouse/Blocks Era===

In August 22, 1999, Cartoon Network Asia began adopting Cartoon Network USA's '''Powerhouse''' theme and utilizing the European '''Blocks''' bumpers. The new shows for 1999 were [[Dexter's Laboratory]], [[Cow &amp; Chicken]], [[I Am Weasel]], [[Ed, Edd n' Eddy]], and [[Johnny Bravo]]. The following year, 2000, saw even more Cartoon Network originals being introduced, including [[The Powerpuff Girls]], [[Mike, Lu &amp; Og]], and [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]. Some of these shows ([[Mike, Lu &amp; Og]], [[Ed, Edd n' Eddy|Ed, Ed, 'n' Eddy]] and [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]) were not produced by Cartoon Network. In 2001, the rate of new Cartoon Network originals kept going, with [[Sheep in the Big City]], [[Time Squad]], and [[Samurai Jack]] being brought in. Due to the large number of Cartoon Network originals that were on Cartoon Network, they decided to name these shows ''[[Cartoon Cartoons]]'', which led to the Friday night block Cartoon Cartoon Fridays being introduced to the Philippines later in 2001. Also in 2001, Cartoon Network introduced other programming blocks including Toonami, Acme Hour, Prime Time, [[Boomerang (Australian TV channel)|Boomerang]] (now a channel) and Cartoon Network After Dark. 2002 saw more [[Cartoon Cartoons]] introduced including [[Grim &amp; Evil]], [[Robot Jones]], and [[Codename: Kids Next Door]]. [[Grim &amp; Evil]] eventually spun off into two separate series, [[The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy]] and [[Evil Con Carne]]. [[Justice League]] and [[Mucha Lucha!]] also debuted on Cartoon Network in 2002. In 2003, there were no new Cartoon Network original shows added to the schedule, however there were several new programming blocks and non-Cartoon-Cartoons added. The programming blocks include Boomeraction (currently a block on the channel Boomerang), and Tiny TV (currently also a block on Boomerang). Shows added to the line-up in 2003 include [[The Mask]], and X Men: Evoloution. 2004 saw the introduction of [[Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends]], the sole program to debut on Cartoon Network in 2004. Programming blocks introduced in 2004 include Fridays and Eyeballs A Go-Go. Also, 2005 was the year that the Boomerang programming block was made into a TV channel.

===October 1, 2005 - August 31, 2008: City Era===
On October 1, 2005, the bumpers were replaced with 3-D animations of a 'city' that all the Cartoon Network toons lived in. Show-specific bumpers were replaced with 3-D animations of a well-known scene from the particular show (e.g.: a [[Dexter's Laboratory]] bumper would feature Dexter's house, a [[The Powerpuff Girls|Powerpuff Girls]] bumper would feature most likely the PPG household, and so forth). The logo was also replaced with a newer 'CN' city-style logo. In 2006, several new Cartoon Network originals premiered, including [[Robotboy]], [[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]], [[Camp Lazlo]], [[Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi]], [[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]] and [[Squirrel Boy]]. The ''Cartoon Cartoons'' moniker previously used for Cartoon Network originals was also dropped in 2006.

===August 31, 2008 - October 1, 2011: New Wave Era===
On August 31, 2008, the format of Cartoon Network's bumpers and commercials changed, and the Cartoon Network Theatre and Fridays Flicks were renamed to Cartoon Network Popcorn. This mimics a similar decision made by [[Cartoon Network Southeast Asia]], with the major visual theme being the recurring 'dynamic line' on the network's official website and also in all the Station IDs, bumpers, etc. During the New Wave Era much of Cartoon Network's comedy/fun-oriented programs (such as [[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]] and [[Camp Lazlo]]), which were popular in the early-mid 2000s, are being shown much less frequently on the network, making way for more anime and action-oriented shows (such as [[Ben 10]], [[Ben 10 Alien Force]], [[Secret Saturdays]]).

Toonixes were were introduced by late 2010, similar to the Cartoon Network US ''Noods'' but smaller, having no ears and the face is that of a cube. They were used in various blocks (such as ''Toonilicious'') and later introduced as avatars for users of the online CN club.

The Toonix were originaly introduced in Latin America, first as avatars on its website, and later, visually on the network's new branding.

===October 1, 2011 - Present: It's a Fun Thing! (Check it) Era===
On October 1, 2011 at 9:00 AM (PHT), during [[The Amazing World of Gumball]] premiere, Cartoon Network introduced its new branding and logo. Designed by [[Brand New School]], it makes heavy use of the black and white checkerboard motif, as well as various CMYK color variations and patterns. The slogan ''It's a Fun Thing!'' was also introduced. Many older advertisments and bumpers from the previous theming (''city'' and ''new wave'') were retained albeit with the adding of the new logo.

The ''Toonilicious'' block switched to a similar theme used in Latin America, again featuring the ''Toonix'', and the Adult Swim block ended. Some of the older blocks (such as Cartoon Network Popcorn) had little to no visual changes save for some minor tweaking and the addition of the new logo.
