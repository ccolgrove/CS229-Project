'''Jack TV''' is a [[Philippines|Philippine]] cable TV network owned by [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]], test launched on May 2005, officially debuting on July 12, 2005. It offers [[Western world|Western]] comedy, animation, sports entertainment, drama series and reality shows, such as [[Cartoon Network]], [[USA Network]], [[The CW]], [[MyNetworkTV]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], [[NBC]], [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]], [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[E! Entertainment Television|E!]]. The station was formed as part of the discontinuation of Solar USA and its split into two networks. Comedy, drama, and reality shows moved to Jack TV, and the other programming was maintained on the new network [[C/S (TV channel)|C/S]](now [[Solar TV]]). However, when Solar TV reformatted to [[ETC (TV channel)|ETC]], Jack TV reverted back to its Solar USA programming while maintaining some of the programming that made it a staple in its early years.
