'''Pine City''' is a city in [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]], [[Minnesota]], [[United States]]. The population was 3,123 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 Census&quot; /&gt;  Pine City is the [[county seat]] of, and the largest city in, [[Pine County, Minnesota|Pine County]]{{GR|6}}.  The Initiative Foundation named Pine City &quot;Outstanding Community&quot; of 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwMSMTsKOZc&amp;feature=related 2009 Outstanding Community Video]&lt;/ref&gt; and the NAMM Foundation identified it as one of the &quot;Best Communities for Music Education in America&quot; for 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.namm.org/news/press-releases/namm-foundation-survey-reveals-best-communities-mu&lt;/ref&gt;

Its name is a loose English translation of &quot;[[Chengwatana, Minnesota|Chengwatana]]&quot; (White-Pine Town), originally an [[Ojibwa|Ojibwe]] village located just east of Pine City, along the [[Snake River (St. Croix River)|Snake River]].  The [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] name for the city is ''Ne-zhingwaakokaag'' (on a land-point full of white pines).  A portion of the [[Mille Lacs Indian Reservation]] is located within Pine City.

==History==
[[Image:Old Pine City Aerial.JPG|thumb|left|Historic Pine City Aerial, overlooking the railroad]]
The [[Sioux|Dakota]] Indians were the first in the area.  With the [[Ojibwa]] expansion, the area became a mixture of the two.  By early 19th century, the area became predominantly Ojibwa.  They trapped and hunted on the land and [[fur trade|traded furs]] at the nearby trading posts.  With the [[Treaty of St. Peters]] of 1837, dubbed the &quot;White Pine Treaty&quot;, lumbering began in the area.  Lumbering, though, was limited by access to the available waterways.

In the late 19th century, European settlers came to the Pine City area, which was still heavily forested with thick stands of [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]], some of the largest in the state.  When the railroad arrived in Pine City so began a logging expansion.  Pine City prospered and grew into a city that had everything needed to serve residents, farmers, and the fast expanding lumber industry.  Pine City was founded in 1881.

When [[Buchanan County, Minnesota|Buchanan County]] was merged with Pine County in 1861, the county seat was consolidated to Pine City because it was already well-established.  Because of its location on the far southern edge of [[Pine County]], there have been attempts over the years to move the county seat to more centrally located [[Hinckley, Minnesota|Hinckley]] and [[Sandstone, Minnesota|Sandstone]].  However, being the most populous city in the county, Pine City always prevailed as the county seat.

In 2005, the city became the first in rural Minnesota with an annual gay pride event, [[East-Central Minnesota Pride]], and one of only two rural communities to hold such an event in the United States.

[[Christmas trees]] for the [[Minnesota Governor's Residence]] have often come from the Pine City area.

A book capturing Pine City's history in vintage photos was written as part of the [[Images of America]] series and became available in 2010.

Pine City is also home to two golf courses, the Pine City Country Club, a nine-hole public course opened in 1971, and Pokegema Lake Golf Course, a par-3 course located just west of town.

The [http://pinecountyfair.com Pine County Fair] takes place in Pine City each year in late July/early August.
