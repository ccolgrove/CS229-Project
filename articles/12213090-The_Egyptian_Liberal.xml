'''''Traitor''''' is a [[2008 in film|2008]] American [[spy film|spy]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film, based on an idea by [[Steve Martin]] who is also an executive producer. Written and directed by [[Jeffrey Nachmanoff]], the film stars [[Don Cheadle]] and [[Guy Pearce]] in the lead roles.

==Plot==
Samir Horn ([[Don Cheadle]]) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking [[Sudan]]ese-American and devout [[Muslim]]. His Sudanese [[Druze]] father was killed by a car bomb when he was a child. As an adult, Horn is first seen operating as an arms dealer. While negotiating a deal with Omar ([[SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui]]) in [[Yemen]] he is arrested and thrown into a Yemeni jail. Later, Samir and Omar become friends and when Omar's people arrange an escape, he takes Samir with them.

Joining the Islamic Brotherhood, Samir uses the skills he learned as a [[Special_Forces_(United_States_Army)#Special_Forces_MOS_descriptions|Special Forces Engineer Sergeant]] with the [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] to bomb the U.S. consulate in [[Nice]], [[France]]. The group then devises a plot to place suicide bombers on 50 buses in the U.S. during [[Thanksgiving]]. Meanwhile, in London, the Islamic Brotherhood finds out Fareed is being targeted by the FBI and he escapes by a source in the FBI headquarters. It is revealed that Samir is working under deep cover for an intelligence contractor, Carter ([[Jeff Daniels]]), with the United States government against terrorism. The FBI agents pursuing him don't know this, and Carter is killed by Omar.

Meanwhile, FBI Special Agent Roy Clayton (Pearce) pursues Samir through numerous countries, resulting in their final confrontation in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]]. While on board a cargo ship to Marseille, France, Samir learns the identity of Nathir and kills Nathir, Fareed, and when Omar is about to kill him, he tells that he switched the bombers' emails and he placed them all on the same bus so all of them died without victims. Canadian police, with the FBI, breaks in and kills Omar and injures Samir.

Later, under an [[Chicago 'L'|El]] bridge in Chicago, Samir tells Agent Clayton he feels guilty for killing innocent people. Samir tells Clayton that the [[Qur'an]] says that to kill an innocent person is to kill all mankind. Clayton responds by noting that the Qur'an also says that by saving an innocent person, you have saved all mankind, and tells Samir he is a hero. The movie ends with Samir praying at a mosque.

Cheadle's performance was praised. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three stars out of four and wrote in his review, &quot;The movie proceeds quickly, seems to know its subject matter, is fascinating in its portrait of the inner politics and structure of the terrorist group, and comes uncomfortably close to reality. But what holds it together is the Cheadle character.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080826/REVIEWS/808269997|title=Roger Ebert Review|publisher=The Chicago Sun-Times|date=2008-09-14|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
