==Overview==
===Origin===
[[My Lovely Sam Soon]]

Originally, it aired as [[My Lovely Sam Soon]] in South Korea. The series was a major hit in [[South Korea]] since its premiere and 50.5% of Korean [[household]]s tuned in to the finale, with a viewership rate of over 40%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200507/200507200032.html My Lovely Sam-Soon was the most watched K-Drama of 2005] '''english.chosun.com'''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics believe its huge success was due to the show focused in the life of single chubby middle-aged woman, played by Kim Sun Ah. The physical appearance and [[stereotype]] that the female character [[highlighter|highlighted]] (in the sense of mid aged and overweight) portrayed in the drama increased dramatically the popularity particularly in mid aged South Korean women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/200507/kt2005072519282510220.htm According to a research, 73% of Korean women believe that they are fat] '''times.hankooki.com'''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sypnosis==
The story begins with Samsoon dealing with two devastating newsâ her fiancÃ© stood her up at their wedding, and their familyâs bakery was gutted by a fire. Samsoon ([[Regine Velasquez|Velasquez]]) then decides to apply as a pastry chef in a five-star restaurant where she crosses paths with the rich and arrogant Cyrus ([[Mark Anthony Fernandez|Fernandez]]) in a very unusual spotâthe male comfort room where he gives her a piece of advice about love and men. Not long after, Cyrus will discover Samsoonâs outstanding talent in baking and hires her to work in his restaurant.

Cyrus has his share of problems too. His domineering mother insists that he marries soon. To be free of his motherâs consistent prodding, Cyrus offers Samsoon a love contractâin which she must act as his girlfriend in exchange for a huge amount of money. He offers Samsoon the contract because he knows he will never fall for a girl like her. Although hesitant and furious about Cyrusâs overconfidence, Samsoon takes the opportunity to pay her familyâs debts.

Are they both brave enough to face the consequences of the love contract? Will their plan still work even if their former paramours â Hannah ([[Nadine Samonte|Samonte]]) and Harvey ([[Wendell Ramos|Ramos]]) â re-enters the picture? Can a gorgeous guy like Cyrus fall for a plump, boisterous girl like Samsoon?

==Success==
The show opened with a rare 33.8% of rating on June 30, 2008 with its competitor [[My Girl (Philippine TV series)|My Girl]] on [[ABS-CBN]]. The success of Ako si Kim Samsoon got to mainstream as Velasquez comic antics flow to thousands of audience every night. The show ends on October 10, 2008 with a 38.2% of rating.
