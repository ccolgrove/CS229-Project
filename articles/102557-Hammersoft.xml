The '''University of TromsÃ¸''' ({{lang-no|Universitetet i TromsÃ¸}}; {{lang-sme|Romssa universitehta}}) is the world's northernmost [[university]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.uit.no/www/inenglish Welcome to the University of TromsÃ¸]&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the city of [[TromsÃ¸]], [[Norway]], it was established in 1968, and opened in 1972. It is one of eight universities in Norway. The University of TromsÃ¸ is the largest research and educational institution in northern Norway. The University's location makes it a natural venue for the development of studies of the region's natural environment, culture, and society.

The main focus of the University's activities is on the [[Auroral light|Auroral light research]], [[Space science]], [[Norwegian College of Fishery Science|Fishery science]], [[Biotechnology]], [[Linguistics]], [[Multiculturalism|Multicultural societies]], [[Sami people|Saami culture]], [[Telemedicine]], [[epidemiology]] and a wide spectrum of Arctic research projects. The close vicinity of the [[Norwegian Polar Institute]], the [[Norwegian Institute of Marine Research]] and the Polar Environmental Centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polarenvironment.no/index.cfm?lid=2 Polar Environmental Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; gives TromsÃ¸ added weight and importance as an international centre for Arctic research. Research activities, however, are not limited to Arctic studies. The University researchers work within a broad range of subjects and are recognised both nationally and internationally.

On January 1, 2009 the University of TromsÃ¸ was merged with [[TromsÃ¸ University College]].
