'''Occupy Oakland''' is a series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] including the [[Occupation (protest)|occupation]] of public spaces that began in [[downtown Oakland]] at [[Frank H. Ogawa Plaza]] in front of [[Oakland City Hall]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]] on October 10, 2011. It is allied with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement in New York City and is one of several [[Occupy movement]] sites in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Other sites included [[Occupy San Francisco]], [[Occupy San Jose]] and [[Occupy Cal]]. 

Occupy Oakland began as a protest encampment at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. It was cleared out by multiple law enforcement agencies on October 25, 2011.&lt;ref name=police_clear&gt;{{cite news|last=Bulwa|first=Demian|title=Police clear Occupy Oakland camps, arrest dozens|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/10/25/BAUB1LLTC9.DTL|accessdate=October 25, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That evening when protesters tried to reclaim the site, clashes between police and protesters resulted in multiple injuries and over 100 arrests. Scott Olsen, an Iraq war veteran, suffered a skull fracture allegedly caused by a police projectile. His injury came to national attention and became a rallying cry for the Occupy movement.&lt;ref name=rt261011/&gt; The site was re-occupied by protesters the next evening. The [[2011 Oakland general strike|general strike]] brought thousands of demonstrators to downtown Oakland for a day of action, including a march to the [[Port of Oakland]] which was forced to shut down operations. That evening, clashes between protesters and police again occurred when protesters occupied a vacant building in downtown Oakland. Two more protesters, one of whom is an Iraq War veteran, were seriously hurt by police and both actions were captured on video. Investigations into the alleged police misconduct are being conducted by the Oakland Police department, the ACLU, and the National Lawyers Guild.

Law enforcement once again cleared the protest encampment at Frank Ogawa Plaza on November 14, 2011. Mayor Jean Quanâs decision to allow the police intervention resulted in the resignation of the mayor's unpaid legal adviser Dan Siegel and Deputy Mayor Sharon Cornu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walter|first=Shoshana|title=2 Top Quan Aides Resign|url=http://www.baycitizen.org/occupy-movement/story/quans-deputy-mayor-resigns/|accessdate=November 16, 2011|newspaper=The Bay Citizen|date=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other protest encampments were created and subsequently dismantled by law enforcement. The last encampment at Snow Park was cleared after an early morning raid on November 21, 2011. The movement was left with no physical presence occupying any public space overnight in the city of Oakland. &lt;ref name=sfsnowpark&gt;{{cite news|last=Kane|first=Will|title=Police clear out last Occupy Oakland camp|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/21/BAO61M24MU.DTL|accessdate=November 21, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 29, demonstrators began a 24/7 vigil at the plaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Colin|first=Chris|title=A teepee grows in Oakland|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/11/30/a_teepee_grows_in_oakland/singleton/|accessdate=December 3 2011|newspaper=Salon|date=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First occupation====
The first occupation lasted for 15 days from October 10 to October 25. [[Frank H. Ogawa Plaza]], was symbolically renamed &quot;Oscar Grant Plaza&quot; by the protestors, referring to [[Oscar Grant]], a young Oakland man killed by a [[BART]] police officer in 2009, an incident that became the catalyst for major protests during 2009 and 2010. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/abraham/2011/10/30/occupy-oakland-the-oscar-grant-frank-ogawa-plaza-issue/|title=Occupy Oakland: The Oscar Grant / Frank Ogawa Plaza Issue|first=Zennie|last=Abraham|date=October 30, 2011|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The occupation of Frank Ogawa Plaza officially began at 4 p.m. on October 10, 2011, with a rally attended by hundreds of supporters. This rally was held in tandem with [[Indigenous People's Day]], both as a statement of solidarity and an expression that this action firmly situated itself against colonialism and nation states.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} The first general assembly, an open democratic meeting based on [[Occupy Wall Street]]'s New York general assembly, was held in the plaza amphitheater at 6 p.m. and a couple dozen protesters set up tents that evening.&lt;ref name=oct11sfgate /&gt; The amphitheater continues to be used as the general assembly location on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings at 6 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupy Oakland|url=http://www.occupyoakland.org/|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Occupy Oakland planned and organized a number of [[direct actions]] including marches and rallies and guest speakers to build support for the movement. On October 14, protesters participated in a short march during rush hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Quintana|first=Sergio|title=Occupy Oakland holds short march during rush hour|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&amp;id=8392891|accessdate=October 18, 2011|newspaper=KGO|date=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following weekend, around 2,500 people, including actor and activist [[Danny Glover]], came out for a Saturday march and rally to show their support for Occupy Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Organizers say thousands took part in Oakland rally|url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/29497557/detail.html|accessdate=October 18, 2011|newspaper=KTVU|date=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 17, the [[2009â2011 detention of American hikers by Iran|three American hikers recently freed from an Iranian prison]] made their first West Coast speaking appearance at Occupy Oakland, drawing an audience of around 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bender|first=Kristine J.|title=Freed American hikers speak to Occupy Oakland on Monday night|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_19132953?nclick_check=1|work=Republished by San Jose Mercury News|publisher=[[Oakland Tribune]]|accessdate=22 November 2011|month=October 18|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A diverse array of people inhabited the camp, ranging from students and professionals to unemployed workers and homeless people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Scott|title=Life at Occupy Oakland attracts range of characters|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/oaklandtribune/localnews/ci_19141204|accessdate=October 23, 2011|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The camp grew to roughly 150 tents that were used for both camping and to provide essential services to protesters and visitors. A &quot;miniature city&quot; evolved complete with a kitchen, library, a bicycle-powered media center, and children's village. The grass was strewn with straw and walkways were created using wooden pallets and boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernard|first=Sara|title=A day in the life of Occupy Oakland|url=http://kalwnews.org/audio/2011/10/24/day-the-life-occupy-oakland_1376708.html|accessdate=November 29, 2011|newspaper=KALW|date=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were tents dedicated to arts and crafts, medical attention, supplies, and conflict resolution.

On October 22, protesters held a rally at the plaza, marched from the plaza to Snow Park and protested outside a branch of Well Fargo. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=====October 25 police raid &amp; evening protest=====
At 4:30 a.m. on October 25, 2011, police officers in [[riot gear]] arrived at the plaza to clear the encampment.&lt;ref name=police_clear/&gt; About two hundred protesters attempted to defend the camp with a make-shift barricade consisting of crates, metal police barricades and dumpsters. As the police entered the camp, some protesters threw bottles, plates, and other kitchen items. &lt;ref name=bender1025&gt;{{cite news |last=Bender |first=Kristen |title=Early morning police raid ousts Occupy Oakland |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/bay-area-news/ci_19188591 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two local NBC reporters described the raid as &quot;violent and chaotic at times.&quot;&lt;ref name=farooq1025&gt;{{cite news|last=Farooq|first=Sajid|title=Occupy Oakland Shut Down|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Occupy-Oakland-Gets-Shut-Down-132527503.html|date=October 25, 2011|accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interim Police Chief Howard Jordan said that [[tear gas]] and [[baton rounds]] were used in response to objects being thrown at officers. One protester saw and heard a [[flash bang grenade]] in the moments before the raid, though Jordan claims they were M-80 and M-1000 firecrackers thrown by protesters.&lt;ref name=farooq1025 /&gt; The post-raid scene was described by reporters for the Oakland Tribune as looking like a &quot;hurricane-struck refugee camp.&quot;&lt;ref name=bender1025 /&gt; 79 people were arrested, most for unlawful assembly and illegal lodging. &lt;ref name=police_clear /&gt;&lt;ref name=city1025&gt;{{cite web|title=Additional Details Regarding OPDâs Enforcement in Frank Ogawa Plaza and Snow Park, October 25, 2011|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/ceda/.../oak031908.pdf|publisher=City of Oakland|accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police erected metal barricades around the perimeter of the plaza as 200-300 protesters gathered around them chanting. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Occupy Oakland protestors march through Oakland after chaotic day of evictions, arrests|url=http://oaklandnorth.net/2011/10/25/occupy-oakland-protestors-march-through-oakland-after-chaotic-day-of-evictions-arrests/|accessdate=November 25, 2011|newspaper=Oakland North|date=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Oakland Police department along with 500 officers from 17 local law-enforcement agencies participated in the morning raid and evening protection of the plaza under a &quot;mutual aid&quot; agreement.

&lt;/ref&gt; At the rally, one reporter noted that &quot;there was a feeling that the way the city responded to the camp was not only out of proportion to the problem, but that it was kind of a waste of money and energy that could be going to address these other issues.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miner|first=Casey|title=The scene at Occupy Oakland|url=http://kalwnews.org/audio/2011/10/26/the-scene-occupy-oakland_1388017.html|accessdate=November 29, 2011|newspaper=KALW News|date=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1,500 and 3,000 people gathered peacefully at the plaza on October 26, 2011. The plaza was re-taken by protesters with at least one tent erected that evening. The general assembly voted to organize a [[general strike]] for November 2.&lt;ref name=return /&gt;&lt;ref name=fagan1029 /&gt;

While most of the day-time activities were peaceful, Oakland Police chief Howard Jordan reported that a small group of &quot;anarchists&quot; vandalized a [[Whole Foods]] storefront, and broke windows and [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s of [[Bank of America]] and [[Wells Fargo]] banks in the afternoon. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Occupy Oakland General Strike Shuts Down Port; Anarchists âBent On Creating Problemsâ|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/11/02/general-strike-protesters-shut-down-port-of-oakland/|accessdate=3 November 2011|publisher=CBS San Francisco|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mercurynews.com/top-stories/ci_19246904 At least 4,000 are at the gates to the Port of Oakland]&lt;/ref&gt; Many buildings were vandalized, including some businesses that displayed signs of support for the General Strike.  After the incidents of vandalism, members of Occupy Oakland organized to guard local businesses, board up broken windows, and clean graffiti caused by the [[black bloc]] vandals.  Oakland mayor Jean Quan described the vandals as &quot;a small and isolated group&quot; that &quot;shouldn't mar the overall impact of the demonstration and the fact that people in the 99 percent movement demonstrated peacefully and, for the most part, were productive and very peaceful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2011%2F11%2F03%2FBACM1LQ5FU.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Henry K. | last=Lee | title=Developer with shotgun scared off Oakland rioters | date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of protesters marched from Frank Ogawa Plaza to the [[Port of Oakland]], the fifth busiest port in the United States, in two separate groups leaving the plaza at 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm. The number of protesters marching to the port has not been confirmed. While police estimate 7,000 people marched, local organizers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video Report from Streets of Oakland: First General Strike in City Since 1946 Shuts Down Major Port|url=http://www.democracynow.org/seo/2011/11/3/video_report_from_streets_of_oakland|accessdate=November 6, 2011|publisher=Democracy Now|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participants &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abraham|first=Zennie|title=Occupy Oakland Strike Draws 100,000; Violence Caused By 100|url=http://blog.sfgate.com/abraham/2011/11/03/occupy-oakland-strike-draws-100000-violence-caused-by-100/|accessdate=November 6, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle - Blog|date=November 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; put the number somewhere between 20,000 and 100,000. As protesters completely filled Middle Harbor Road, the main road leading to the port, all truck traffic entering or exiting the port was halted. Port operations were &quot;effectively shut down&quot; a couple hours later.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Occupy Oakland throng closes down port|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/03/MN8Q1LPI1J.DTL|accessdate=November 3, 2011|date=November 2, 2011|newspaper=The San Francisco Chronicle|first1=Demian|last1=Bulwa|first2=Matthai|last2=Kuruvila|first3=Kevin|last3=Fagan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the evening, a group of protesters took over a vacant building that once served as the headquarters of the Traveler's Aid Society, a non-profit organization that provided services to the local homeless population. Police soon arrived to break up the protesters gathered outside of the building. Some protesters fled while others set a barricade on fire. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Loftis|first=Emily|title=Occupy Oakland shuts down port|url=http://www.salon.com/2011/11/03/occupy_oakland_shuts_down_port/|accessdate=November 4, 2011|newspaper=Salon|date=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police used teargas and flash bangs to try to clear protesters.

On November 5, the City Council met to consider a resolution by council member [[Nancy Nadel]] in support of the Occupy Oakland encampment.  After listening to over 100 members of the public, the council postponed its vote until November 15. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tense Meeting Reveals Deep Divisions over Occupy Oakland|url=http://www.baycitizen.org/occupy-movement/story/tense-meeting-reveals-deep-divisions/|accessdate=November 5, 2011|publisher=The Bay Citizen|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A downtown Oakland Wells Fargo branch closed for business because of the roughly 100 immigrant rights protesters who marched from Occupy Oakland's encampment to protest the bank's connection to companies that run [[Immigration detention in the United States|immigrant detention centers]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wohlsen|first=Marcus|title=Protesters close down Oakland Wells Fargo branch|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2011/11/05/state/n134250D33.DTL|accessdate=November 5, 2011|newspaper=AP - San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weeks 5 - 7 (November 7 â November 27)===
On November 7, Occupy Oakland accepted a $20,000 donation for urgent medical and legal expenses from Occupy Wall Street. The money was deposited into an Occupy Oakland lawyer's Wells Fargo bank account. The Occupy Oakland general assembly approved the decision to hold the money temporarily in a Wells Fargo account to be used immediately for bailing out jailed protesters. When the group's status as an unincorporated association is approved, the money will be transferred to a local credit union. This deposit was seen by some news outlets and some Occupy Oakland protesters as hypocritical because just a few days earlier, Occupy Oakland had protested against Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo spokesman Ruben Pulido said, &quot;If this report is true, it demonstrates that even Occupy Oakland understands â firsthand â the value and service that Wells Fargo provides its customers. Wells Fargo welcomes the 100 percent of Americans to allow us to help them meet their financial needs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2011/11/occupy-oakland-makes-20k-deposit-wells-fargo Occupy Oakland makes $20K deposit at Wells Fargo], San Francisco Examiner, November 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/11/09/occupy-oakland-protesters-deposit-funds-at-wells-fargo-after-bank-attacks/ Occupy Oakland Protesters Deposit Funds At Wells Fargo After Bank Attacks], CBS News, November 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, five members of the Oakland City Council, Desley Brooks, [[Ignacio De La Fuente]], Pat Kernighan, Libby Schaaf, Larry Reid, two dozen clergy, and Oakland business owners held a press conference calling for the immediate eviction of Occupy Oakland. The group alleged that the ongoing protest had harmed the economy of downtown Oakland, and cited reports of fire hazards in the camp. Occupy protesters interrupted the press conference by chanting, &quot;We are the 99 percent of Oakland.&quot; The council members counter chanted: &quot;Occupy Oakland must go.&quot; The press conference ended earlier than anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;Kuruvila, Matthai [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/09/BAH61LSRPF.DTL Occupy protesters shout down Oakland council] ''San Francisco Chronicle'' November 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days preceding November 14, Oakland Police delivered 'notices of violations' to Frank Ogawa plaza.  In the early hours of November 14, approximately 700-1000 police were mobilized.  Supporters began arriving, and and a line of union workers wearing white arm bands formed a line to observe and mediate if necessary.&lt;ref name=Liveblog&gt;{{cite web|last=Bender|first=Kristin J.|title=Occupy Oakland Live Blog: Police outnumber protesters at Ogawa plaza|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/occupy-oakland/ci_19331752|publisher=Mercury News|accessdate=16 November 2011|author=Josh Richman, Thomas Peele and Sean Maher|month=November|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At approximately 4:30 AM, police entered the plaza.  Police initially made about 20 arrests, 14 of whom had been praying all night in the campâs inter faith tent.&lt;ref name=Liveblog/&gt; Afterwards, police demolished the camp.   

[[Daniel Mark Siegel|Dan Siegel]], Mayor Jean Quan's city hall Legal Adviser, resigned in protest, announcing, via Facebook: &quot;No longer Mayor Quan's legal adviser. Resigned at 2 am.

The website states the flyer was created in response to calls by the Occupy Oakland General Assembly convened on 11.11.11.&lt;ref name=OaklandSite-19Nov/&gt;

On the morning of November 21 the last Occupy camp at Snow Park was dismantled by the city. The roughly 100 protestors left behind nearly 21 truckloads of debris. The movement was left with no physical presence occupying any public space overnight in the city of Oakland. &lt;ref name=sfsnowpark /&gt;
