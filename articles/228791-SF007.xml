__NOTOC__
'''climm''' (previously mICQ) is a [[free software|free]] text-based [[instant messaging]] [[client (computing)|client]] that runs on a wide variety of platforms, including [[AmigaOS]], [[BeOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] (using either [[Cygwin]] or [[MinGW]]), [[Mac OS X]], [[NetBSD]]/[[OpenBSD]]/[[FreeBSD]], [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], and [[AIX operating system|AIX]].

climm has many of the features the official [[ICQ]] client has, and more:

* It has support for SSL-encrypted direct connection compatible with licq and [[Simple Instant Messenger|SIM]].
* It supports [[Off-the-Record_Messaging|OTR]] encrypted messages.
* It is [[internationalization|internationalized]]; [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], and other translations are available, and it supports sending and receiving acknowledged and non-acknowledged [[Unicode]]-encoded messages (it even understands [[UTF-8]] messages for message types the [[ICQ]] protocol does not use them for).
* It is capable of running several UINs at the same time and is very configurable (e.g. different colors for incoming messages from different contacts or for different accounts).
* Due to its [[command-line interface]], it has good usability for [[blindness|blind]] users through [[text-to-speech]] interfaces or [[Braille]] devices. &lt;!--does this belong here?--&gt;

climm also supports basic functionality of the XMPP protocol.

climm is licensed under the terms of version 2 of the [[GNU General Public License]], and it was recently relicensed to include the [[OpenSSL exception]]. Versions prior to mICQ 0.4.8 were released by [[Matt D. Smith]] into the public domain; however, not much of the original code remains. All later additions were by [[RÃ¼diger Kuhlmann]]; in particular, the support for the current ICQ v8 protocol.

mICQ was renamed to climm with version change to 0.6. climm stands for &quot;Command Line Interface Multi Messenger&quot;.
