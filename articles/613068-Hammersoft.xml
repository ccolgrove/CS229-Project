*'''[[Wolfrider#Bearclaw|Bearclaw]]''' (soulname: Renn) male. Son of Mantricker and Thornflower, possible half-brother of Moonshade, lifemate of Joyleaf, father of Cutter and possibly Foxfur, grandfather of Suntop and Ember. Tenth chief of the Wolfriders, Bearclaw took risks, lived in &quot;the now,&quot; and provoked humans for amusement. He had brown hair, brown eyes, a beard and thin moustache. He was known for rowdiness, gambling with trolls, and a fine taste for dreamberry wine. He was also fiercely protective  of his tribe. Bearclaw was killed by the monster Madcoil after mortally wounding it. At the end of his life, Bearclaw's wolf friend was Blackfell, after the death of the wolf Snapper.&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

Head of the Jackwolfriders, Dart, very much a natural leader, took it upon himself as a young child to teach the Sun Folk to defend themselves, and later led a lengthy, fateful expedition to the far-southern Forevergreen forest. Dart has significant ability at weaponless martial-arts-like fighting and teaches his skills to all who ask.  He has a slender build, russet-brown hair, dark skin and brown eyes.

Son of Huntress Skyfire and possibly Dreamsinger, brother of Nightstar, father of Tanner (originally Oakroot), Fangslayer, and Long Oak by his lifemate Starflower. He was a wanderer and secretly sired a son by recognizing a member of the forefathers of the Go-Backs, then a Goatrider, Two-Shadows, when he wandered on the plains. The son's name was Hawkcatcher. He only  encountered his son much later and was attacked by him, Hawkcatcher believing his mother's death was caused by Freefoot's abandonment. He was forced to kill the boy and bury him on the plains. He told no one, but it did not ruin his wandering habits. Sixth chief of the Wolfriders. Died when, while rescuing elf &quot;cubs&quot; (children) from a tree during a thunderstorm, he was struck by lightning (ironically, &quot;skyfire&quot;).&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Goodtree|Goodtree]]'''(soulname: Neme) female. Daughter of Tanner and Stormlight, lifemate to both Lionleaper and Acorn, mother of Mantricker and Speedwell, possible grandmother of Spark. The eighth chief of the Wolfriders, she was the only wolf chief with plant-shaping ability and began the shaping of what would become the tribe's first Father Tree, later referred to as &quot;Goodtree's Rest.&quot; It is believed she is the great-grandmother of Redlance, through her daughter Speedwell. &lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Joyleaf|Joyleaf]]'''(soulname: Dehl) female. Sister of Treestump, aunt of Dewshine, great-aunt of Windkin, Recognized lifemate of Bearclaw, mother of Cutter, grandmother of Ember and Suntop, later called Sunstream.

One of her wolf-friends was called Shadowsheen.&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Kimo|Kimo]]''' male.

Kimo has blue eyes, blue-black hair, and medium brown skin inherited from his Sun Folk sire. He has recently developed his shape-shifting talent and often turns himself into a wolf. Kimo, who grew up in the Sun Village, is now part of Cutter's tribe.

*'''[[Wolfrider#Mantricker|Mantricker]]''' male. Son of Goodtree and Lionleaper, younger brother of Speedwell (a female who was killed in early adulthood), father of Bearclaw and possibly others.  Lovemate of Moonshade's mother Brightwater. Ninth chief of the Wolfriders, he was renowned for his constant trickery at the expense of nearby human tribes - yet he also forged a unique partnership with the human scout Demontricker, which helped keep the peace between elves and humans during Demontricker's lifetime. But in later generations, the human tribes kept up their harassment of the Wolfriders, and in desperation Mantricker kidnapped a human boy and cut his face as a warning.  A band of human trackers angrily fired blind arrow-shots and spears toward the elf; one spear found its mark, killing the chief. The boy, later revealed as &quot;Scar,&quot; held a grudge against elves until his death at Bearclaw's hands. Mantricker had dark brown hair and brown eyes.&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Moonshade|Moonshade]]''' (soulname: Eyrn) female. Daughter of Brightwater and possibly of Mantricker. Possible half-sister of Bearclaw. Lifemate of Strongbow and mother of Crescent (deceased), Dart and Chitter. She is the tanner of Cutter's Wolfriders, taught her skills to Tyleet, and is now instructing Shuna, the human daughter of Cutter and Leetah. She is quiet and not a natural fighter, utterly devoted and perhaps a bit subservient to her lifemate. Moonshade has soft brown curls, violet eyes, and occasionally a bit of a temper and sharp tongue. Tribe member and elder of Cutter's Wolfriders.

Daughter of Rainsong and Woodlock, sister of Mender and Wing, granddaughter of Rain, niece of Pike, cousin of Sust, lifemate of (the deceased) Lutei of the Sun Folk, mother of Kimo. Weaver. Occasional lovemate of Skywise. She is very slender and has extremely long straight blond hair and blue eyes; while she lived with the Sun Folk she maintained medium-brown skin, which, now having returned to the forest, she has lightened.

Daughter of Longbranch and Brownberry, niece of One-Eye, cousin to Scouter and his unnamed sister, lifemate of Redlance, mother of Tyleet, grandmother of Pool.

Son of Rain, half-brother of Rainsong, uncle of Newstar, Wing, and Mender, great-uncle of Kimo and Serrin, briefly lovemate of Vaya, lifemate of Krim and (the deceased) Skot of the Go-Backs, possible father of Cheipar (who died in infancy) and Sust. Named for his great skill with a spear. He has puffy red hair and blue eyes, and is frequently teased by the Wolfriders for his great love of (intoxicating) dreamberries. Mischievous, happy-go-lucky and a follower by nature, Pike is a howl-keeper (tribal storyteller) and the eldest of Ember's Wolfriders.

*'''[[Wolfrider#Prey-Pacer|Prey-Pacer]]''' male. (soulname: Owm) Youngest child of Rahnee the She-Wolf and Zarhan Fastfire, lifemate of Softfoot, Recognized Wreath, father of Two-Spear, Dove, and Huntress Skyfire (by Wreath), and others.

Second chief of the Wolfriders and full sister of Laststar. She had silvery hair and violet eyes. She Recognized her lifemate Zarhan Fastfire multiple times until her &quot;death&quot;. When Zarhan sought her out, they discovered a new tribe of plains elves and answered the call of Recognition to different elves. Though she is assumed to have died later on, this is unconfirmed.&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Rain|Rain]]''' male. Lifemate unknown. Father of Pike and Rainsong, grandfather of Mender, Wing, and Newstar, great-grandfather of Kimo and (deceased) Serrin, great-great grandfather of (deceased) Bowki.

Daughter of (deceased) Rain, half-sister of Pike, lifemate of (deceased) Woodlock, mother of Newstar, (deceased) Wing and Mender, grandmother of Kimo and (deceased) Serrin, great-grandmother of (deceased) Bowki. Utterly devoted to her unusually large brood of &quot;cubs&quot; (children), Rainsong was called &quot;Lifebearer&quot; and &quot;a wonder&quot; because she and Woodlock had their three children within 12 years, a very short time by elfin standards. She had chin-length blond hair with bangs, blue eyes, and habitually wore a large sunhat. Died of old age at Sorrow's End.

*'''[[Wolfrider#Redlance|Redlance]]''' (soulname: Ulm) male. Lifemate of Nightfall, father of Tyleet, grandfather of Pool. Plant-shaper, gentle soul, excellent tracker, and lover of children, Redlance has red hair and &quot;face fur.&quot; Tribe member of Cutter's Wolfriders.

He has dark brown hair and sideburns, and brown eyes. Scouter has the best eyesight of both Wolfrider tribes, and possibly the worst temper as well. When Dewshine and Pool are kidnapped by the human Lehrigan, he temporarily seized control of the tribe, but later relented cheftainship back to Ember. Tribe member of Ember's Wolfriders. 

*'''[[Wolfrider#Skyfire|Huntress Skyfire]]''' (soulname: Kyr) female. Daughter of Prey-Pacer and Wreath, half-sister of Two-Spear, lifemate of Dreamsinger, mother of Freefoot and Nightstar. Fifth chief of the Wolfriders, she gained control of the tribe after challenging her increasingly warlike, psychopathic brother to a duel. Skyfire lost the challenge and was grievously wounded, but Two-Spear, perhaps feeling his grip on the tribe slipping away, exiled himself along with about half the tribe members; his sister became leader of the rest.  Skyfire formulated the Way of the Wolfriders, the ethic and habits by which they live.&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Skywise|Skywise]]''' (soulname: Fahr) male. Son of Shale and Eyes High, soul brother of Cutter and part of Cutter's family, father of Yun (daughter), possible father of (daughter) Jink (of the far future), perpetual &quot;ladies' man,&quot; and lover of the stars. Casual lovemates are known to include the Glider Aroree, Vurdah, Maleen and Ruffel of the Sun Folk, Newstar, and the unknown Go-back mother of Yun, among others; currently, Skywise is admiring Krill of the Wavedancer tribe.  Skywise, whose parents died at the time of his birth, was raised by the entire tribe of Wolfriders.  Tribe member of Cutter's Wolfriders, probable future Master of the Palace, probable future Recognized lifemate of the High One, Timmain, whom he also had as a wold-friend (in wolf shape). 

*'''[[Wolfrider#Strongbow|Strongbow]]''' male. (soulname: Wyl) Son of (deceased) Trueflight and an unknown father, father of (deceased) Crescent, Dart, and Chitter, grandfather of (deceased) Bowki. Archer and elder of Cutter's band, Strongbow and his lifemate Moonshade are the tribal conservatives, standing fast against unwise change and acting as keepers of the Way of the Wolfriders.  Strongbow's psychic &quot;sending&quot; ability is the strongest of any Wolfrider but the spectacularly powerful Suntop; of the rest, only Cutter approaches his mental range and force.  He has russet brown hair and eyes and &quot;face fur.&quot; His known wolf-friends are Briarsting, Lashpaw and Gnawbone. It is possible that he is alive in the future elf Jink's time under the name &quot;Archer&quot;.

*'''[[Wolfrider#Sunstream|Sunstream]]''' (formerly called '''Suntop'''; soulname: Klynn) male. Son of Cutter and Leetah, twin brother of Ember, grandson of Anatim (Suntoucher), Toorah, Bearclaw and Joyleaf, nephew of Shenshen, great-nephew of Treestump, first cousin once removed of Dewshine, second cousin of Windkin. Recognized lifemate of Brill of the Wavedancers; their relationship is long-distance. He has blond hair and blue eyes and is by far the tallest of the Wolfriders.  Member of Cutter's tribe. He is one of at least nine known elves who can &quot;go out&quot; into the spirit world.  Sunstream, whose sending power is almost unlimited, has a deep magic-sensing ability and is to become the conduit by which all elves communicate over long distances.

*'''[[Wolfrider#Tanner|Tanner]]''' (soulname: Lhu) male, originally named Oakroot. Son of Freefoot and Starflower, lifemate to Stormlight, father of Goodtree. Seventh chief of the Wolfriders, he had one of the longest tribal reigns (some 800 years) and certainly one of the most peaceful, marked by the absence of run-ins with humans. He stumbled across the method for tanning leathers, after a human hunter (jokingly referred to as &quot;Lift-Leg&quot;) inadvertently urinated into a bundle of skins he was storing. &lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Timmorn|Timmorn Yellow-Eyes]]''' male, not only the first Wolfrider chief but the first Wolfrider ever. Son of Timmain (a High One who had shaped herself into a wolf) and a true male wolf, lifemate to Valloa (also called Murrel or New-Wolf), but lovemate to many others, father of Rahnee the She-Wolf, Laststar, Threetoe the Father, Frost, Glowstone, Sharpears, Journey, and many others.&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Treestump|Treestump]]''' male. Brother of Joyleaf, uncle of Cutter, lifemate of Rillfisher (deceased) and now Clearbrook, father of Dewshine, grandfather of Windkin, great-uncle of Sunstream and Ember. Hunter and warrior, Treestump is the Wolfriders' most robust and physically powerful tribe member. Treestump was once named Birdcall; it is said his name was changed due to his inability to be intimidated or moved in battle. He has curly blond hair and thick &quot;face fur.&quot; Treestump, the oldest living Wolfrider, is second-chief of Cutter's Wolfriders, and up until recently has been the one to take over when Cutter is absent.  Due to the need of Cutter's Wolfriders for metal weapons, with great difficulty Treestump has recently taught himself blacksmithing.

*'''[[Wolfrider#Two-Spear|Two-Spear]]''' (soulname: Marr) male. Son of Prey-Pacer, lifemate to Willowgreen, brother of Huntress Skyfire and Dove, father of Kahvi (the future Go-Back chieftess), grandfather of Vaya (deceased), Venka and possibly Teir. Fourth chief of the Wolfriders. He launched a brutal attack on a neighboring tribe of humans he believed to blame for the death of a Wolfrider named Dove, which his sister Skyfire feared would lead to an all-out war that might annihilate the elves. Convinced her brother was slipping into insanity, she duelled with him to seize control of the tribe but failed, suffering near-fatal wounds in the process. Despite his victory, Two-Spear immediately quit the tribe along with his supporters; his faction later evolved into the Go-Back tribe under the leadership of his daughter, Kahvi.&lt;br clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;

*'''[[Wolfrider#Tyleet|Tyleet]]''' (soulname: Sohn) female. Daughter of Nightfall and Redlance, granddaughter of Brownberry and Longbranch, great-niece of One-Eye, first cousin once removed and Recognized lifemate of Scouter, lifemate of Dewshine, mother of Pool. Huntress, linguist, and tanner. She has hazel eyes and wavy, light reddish hair in a distinctive triple-tiered hairdo. Tyleet, probably the sweetest and gentlest of all the Wolfriders owing to her upbringing in a time of near-complete safety and security, is very fond of humans and once adopted and raised a human baby (Little Patch). Because of her close links with humans, Tyleet was the first elf to learn the language of the New Land humans and pass it to other elves. Tribe member of Ember's Wolfriders.

*'''[[Wing (Elfquest)|Wing]]''' male. Son of Woodlock and Rainsong, brother of Mender and Newstar, uncle of Kimo, Recognized lifemate of Behtia (of the Sun Folk), father of Serrin and grandfather of Bowki. He considered himself a Sun Villager in all aspects and passed his entire long life there. He had his mother's blond hair and blue eyes.

A rockshaper, he expended much effort creating the Bridge of Destiny, a rock arch high above the village, then committed suicide by letting himself fall from the bridge.

==Glider Elves==
Unless otherwise noted, all Gliders have the inherent ability to float/fly. Gliders are immortal and are considered First-, Second-, and Thirdborns of the original High Ones. They resided in Blue Mountain and are considered an extinct tribe.

*[[Lord Voll]] - Male, deceased. Founder of the Gliders; long-time lovemate of Winnowill, he states he is the child of High Ones, possibly Deir and Gibra, who had birthed a son called Vol in the years after the Palace fell. He was the leader of the Gliders for many years.  He lived in a state of depression believing his people to be going stagnant and believed there were no more elven children.  Upon seeing Ember and Suntop, he became rejuvenated, until a dark sending from Winnowill put him into a deep sleep.  When Leetah woke him from his sleep he asked the Wolfriders to seek the Palace of the High Ones with him. When they declined he offered to help them find a new holt, but instead forced them to follow him to the palace. A projectile fired by trolls from a giant ballista impaled Voll and his bond-bird, Tenspan, killing both and earning the Wolfriders the scorn of many of the Gliders, with Aroree and Tyldak being possibly the only ones not to blame them.
He had silver hair and pale eyes.

*[[Winnowill]]- female, deceased, in body but not in spirit; Once lovemated to Lord Voll and later Rayek's love mate, mother of Two-Edge

She was a healer, but after the Gliders retreated into the safety of Blue Mountain her gift was not needed and festered. Her mental state degraded at the growing despair of realizing herself as useless in placid society.In order to cling to her remaining sanity, she purposely injured her fellow Gliders to practice her gift. She controlled the Chosen Eight, and secretly the lives of all Gliders. Voll once asked her to help the female Gliders bear children, and she did, only to make them miscarry in secret, knowing Blue Mountain would not support more of their kind. 

Winnowill finally decided to find the Palace for Voll's sake and her own, and left the mountain alone, only to encounter an injured troll named Smelt, who had been sent to collect rockshapers. Winnowill saw the opportunity for experiments with a willing subject. She mated with him to produce Two-Edge, then killed Smelt when he remembered what he had come to the mountain for. She returned to the Gliders as a [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic]] [[megalomania]]c, and has been the principal elfin villain of the series.

When the arrival of the Wolfriders threatened to lead her people back to the outside world, she tried to prevent this. Later she tried to annihilate the Wolfriders. She spent about ten thousand years creating monsters and playing with the humans in the new land, known to some of them as Lady of the Waves. 

The Palace of the High Ones was destroyed when she tried to conquer it, and was thwarted by Rayek and his daughter Venka. Immediately before it was restored, she let herself be killed to free her soul, so that her spirit could wreak havoc worldwide using the Palace. Rayek intervened by absorbing her spirit into himself, claiming that since he once held all the spirits of the Gliders, he could hold her. Since that time she has been vying for control of his body, even occasionally reshaping it into her female form, and constantly resisting his efforts to make her renounce evil. Winnowill is gradually gaining more control over her magic, but the two elves are in constant struggle.

She had long black hair and green eyes. She could not float, but was the first in Blue Mountain to master black sending, or pain telepathy.

*[[Aroree]]-female, alive; member of the chosen eight; lovemate of Skywise

Aroree was one of the Chosen Eight. Even after falling in love with Skywise and wanting to be free she was loyal to Winnowill and did not leave the Gliders - until she kidnapped Windkin, [[Tyldak]]'s son, whom gave to Winnowill as a replacement for herself, triggering  the events of ''The Siege of Blue Mountain''. There is some tension between her and the other elves as a result of her kidnapping of the infant Windkin. 

She later helped both Rayek and Kahvi attain their destinations as she wanders the skies on her giant bondbird, Littletrill. She would later join the Wolfriders and became a respected member of the tribe, and a teacher. After the restoration of the palace she accompanied Venka, hoping to find Tyldak.

She is very tall for an elf, with long blonde hair and large blue eyes; her nickname is Sad Eyes. 

:Appearances: Original Quest, ''Siege at Blue Mountain'', ''Kings of the Broken Wheel'', ''Dreamtime'', storyline ''Shards''

*[[Tyldak]] - male, missing; lovemate of Kahvi, recognized the Wolfrider Dewshine, father of Windkin

Tyldak loved flying so much that he asked Winnowill to re-shape his body to have wings instead of arms, so that he could truly fly. He was very loyal to Winnowill, partly because he felt he owed her for this favor. He recognized Dewshine, resulting in the cub Windkin who floats. Winnowill later betrays him, chaining him to the throne hall floor, never again to fly. He was freed by Two-Edge during the frenzy of the Fall of Blue Mountain. Took the Go-Back chieftess Kahvi as his lovemate. He is extraordinarily devoted to her, and claims he must &quot;protect&quot; her from herself.

:Appearances: Original Quest, ''Siege at Blue Mountain'', ''Kings of the Broken Wheel'', ''Going Back'', ''Kahvi''
Unshaped, he had curly golden brown hair and brown eyes.

*[[Egg (Elfquest)|Egg/Aurek]] -formerly known as '''Egg'''; male, alive

He was one of the rockshapers that were in a permanent trace, living only to fulfill their purpose. His was shaping the Egg of Six Spheres, a floating stone egg that showed in pictures the history of the elves - this was only possible because he had knowledge of it. After the death of Lord Voll he had a vision of Timmain, charging him with remembering, and starting to wake him up. He survived the fall of Blue Mountain with the help of Two-Edge and built a more humble home in the remains. Aurek created two &quot;eggs,&quot; one was destroyed with the Gliders, the other was taken by Kahvi herself as a trophy for her people. With one of these Aurek showed Kahvi her own past and the origin of the [[Go-Back]]s to her. 

About a millennium later on the World of Two Moons, he becomes a mentor to [[Jink]], the elf-woman living among the humans of Abode's space age.

:Appearances: Original Quest, ''Long Dream's Ending'', ''Kahvi'', ''Jink''
He has pale hair and pale eyes, and seems to enjoy nature and animals. He has some small floating ability.

*[[Kureel]] - male. deceased

He was one of the Chosen Eight, loyal to Winnowill, and very hostile toward the [[Wolfrider]]s - the latter in part because they killed a young giant hawk that would have been his bond bird when grown. After the fall of Blue Mountain he tried to kill Dart and his human friend Geoki, and was in turn killed by Strongbow. Deeply guilty for this albeit necessary act, Strongbow sought Kureel's soul in the Palace to ask for forgiveness.  For his part, Kureel was now at peace, barely remembered the circumstances of his death, and granted it immediately.

*[[Male Door (Elfquest)|Male Door]]-male, deceased; recognized to Dodia, father of No-Name

He shaped Winnowill's secret chambers, and was put into a permanent trance after he had nearly let Two-Edge's father escape. He stayed loyal to Winnowill, trying to keep the chambers secured even while Blue Mountain was collapsing, but Cutter forced him to make a way to the outside.

The Hoan G'Tay Sho took him with them on their search for a new home in the rainforests of Sunholt, then spent the next 10,000 years building an elaborate elf-based religion around him. However, it took him millennia to return to lucidity, which immediately turned to rage and hatred. He lured Windkin and some of the Jack-wolf riders to the Forevergreen, where he tried to draw Windkin on his side, to help him rebuild the Gliders, and to rule the humans. He Recognized the Sun Villager Dodia, who, ashamed at being pregnant by such an evil man, beat him with a club. Door is assumed dead, as Dodia raised their child in a cave, tied up to prevent any rockshaping powers from manifesting. She calls their child No-Name, and claims his father's spirit will corrupt him.

Door may have been able to float.

==Original WaveDancers elves==
This series, published in 1993-94, was produced by artist [[Jozef Szekeres]] and co-writers [[Julie Ditrich]] and [[Bruce Love]] of [[Black Mermaid Productions]] in [[Australia]]. Because of a legal dispute between that studio and Warp Graphics over the ownership of the characters, the series was stripped of its place as a canonical Elfquest story. A court settlement between Black Mermaid and Warp prevents either company from republishing the six-issue series in whole, with Black Mermaid having the rights to the characters of OWD and Warp Graphics the WaveDancers title/name.

After establishing the colony, she flesh-shaped her legs into a tail along with the other three first comers and some of the other elves from later generations.
*[[Barmek]] male. Barmek is the son of Kirith and Rhialdor, and does not take himself as seriously as his brother Jormak does. Barmek is smart and has very good instincts. He has the adventurous spirit of an explorer and is not afraid to take risks. Most of the time he is friendly and gentle, but if his loved ones are threatened he can be savage and show his teeth. Barmek is 5 feet tall, average height for a WaveDancer, with a crop of golden hair and laughing brown eyes. He recognises with Raenafel who he first accidentally encountered when he was just a young squirt.
*[[Brom (Elfquest)|Brom]] (deceased) male. Father of Raenafel and soulmate of Ailsa, Brom was the third generation Crown and younger half brother of Shardon.

He was a strong, majestic and determined leader. He never rested and was ever vigilant and quite driven. He was about 5 feet 3&amp;nbsp;inches, with strands of white hair on his temples and a flowing grey beard that weighed him down in the water.

He is the father to Illora, a Child of Recognition, who was stolen from the WaveDancers.
*[[Inkbottom]] male. Inkbottom is the half brother to Sleia, and his parents are Shoseabee and Kadva. He is a squirt with large pointy ears and big blue eyes, and is a leader rather than follower. Inkbottom is occasionally led astray by Shoresprout, but he is a sensitive little elf with potentially good telepathic abilities which would have emerged in subsequent series. He tends to err on the side of caution. Inkbottom gets his name from the birthmark in the shape of an octopus on his buttock.
*[[Illora]] female. Illora is a Child of Recognition who was stolen when she was a small child. She is the daughter of Tilaweed and Hyfus, and has a small pixiesh face with long ears in her true form, and is quite distorted and grotesque in her altered form.

He is cunning and shrewd and can be manipulative at times, and certainly not be laughed at for it would raise his wrath.

Though she is a third generation WaveDancer, she is one of the elders. She is also known as the &quot;birthing mother&quot; by the others as she is the midwife to the colony.

Rhialdor is Kirith's lifemate, and she is the mother of Jormak and Barmek.
*[[Korillia]] female. Korillia is quite tall for a WaveDancer, about 6 feet including her tentacles. In some ways she is a freak in the colony because of her hybrid form: half WaveDancer and half octopus (she is the victim of a patch of bad magic when her mother was pregnant with her). Korillia has a mop of red curly hair and violet eyes. Her tail is crimson with pink/purple suckers. Her tentacles have given her a purpose in the colony: she is the cook and has a special talent for turning anything in the ocean into foodstuff for the elves (except for octos with which she has an affinity). Korillia is quite temperamental and is a perfectionist. She has been known to cry into her cooking shells at times when she doesn't get her way. Korillia is a second born, but is barren. The squirts in the colony like to tease and play tricks on her.
*[[Lazik]] male. Lazik has brown hair and large blue eyes, and is one of the storytellers in the WaveDancer community. He is a naive elf with good intentions, so he is easily influenced by Sydor.

*[[Maron (Elfquest)|Maron]] male. Maron is one of the fourth generation elves, and is slight in build but quite sporty and adventurous.

*[[Raenafel]] female. Raenafel is a fourth generation WaveDancer and is destined to be the fourth Crown by her birthright. Brom and Ailsa are Raenafel's parents, and she was born a Child of Recognition. She stands taller than the average female WaveDancer, and can look most male elves in the eye. She has extremely long thick hair the colour of midnight, and her plush deep purple eyes are doe-like in appearance. In contrast to the other elves, Raenafel is a babe in the woods and knows nothing of the world except for what she learn from Brom's, Kirith's and No-Wing's teachings when she was hidden away. Despite her naivety and her lack of socialisation, she has tremendous powers: healing and flesh-shaping. Raenafel is a natural leader and does not shirk at the threat of danger, and she takes her role as the next Crown very seriously.
*[[Rhialdor]] male. Rhialdor is the lifemate of Kirith and sire of Barmek and Jormak. He is a pacifist by nature, and takes on the role of clown or court jester within the community.

*[[Shoresprout]] female. Shoresprout is the rambunctious but adorable daughter of Burdekin and Zadori and a seventh generation WaveDancer. She has orange hair and lime green eyes, and wears a tunic to match. Her best friend is Inkbottom who is just a little younger than her, and she is definitely the leader of the two. She can be quite mischievous and spirited, and is not adverse to getting into trouble. Shoresprout can also be quite dramatic, and loves the re-enactment of the WaveDancer history by the rest of the Storytellers.
*[[Shoseabee]] female. Shoseabee is quite an exotic elf with large almond shaped brown eyes, a snub nose and short golden hair. She is one of the Storytellers to the clan and loves to dance.

*[[Sleia]] female. Sleia is the daughter of Lazik and Shoseabee, and half sister to Inkbottom. She has a well-toned body for a female elf and is shorter than the average WaveDancer. She has crystal blue eyes and light sandy-brown hair which she keeps braided. She has a square jaw, a broad nose and strong forehead. Sleia is not known as a pretty elf, but what she lacks in looks is made up tenfold in courage and personality. She can be wilful and cheeky, and is very nimble. She is Barmek's best friend, and is loyal, honesty and trustworthy. Quiet and a little reserved around most of the others, she blossoms into a gregarious and delightful personality when she is adventuring with Barmek. She can be humorous, outgoing and talkative and is the more practical of the two. Sleia can move with great stealth, and is very comfortable with her body and her sporting prowess.
*[[Sydor]] (also known as Rydos, his name rearranged) male. Sydor, the High One, is very tall and gangly in appearance. He has cobalt blue eyes and his hair is frosted creme. He is silent and lethal in his actions, and is a dark character who has split inside himself. He lives in secrecy waiting patiently for the time when he can change all and sundry into their original forms and return to the skies in the palace. He mismanages his magic, and uses his flesh-shaping abilities to inflict pain on the innocent even though he is convinced that he is doing the right thing. Sydor also has the ability to black send and to create a bubble around him that refracts light and therefore appears invisible under water.
*[[Tentus]] male. Tentus is the only first generation elf still alive in the WaveDancer colony, and possesses the ability of rock/coral shaping. He is the younger brother of Neama, and the child of Ausra and Desh. He is medium in height and has a receding hairline of white hair, bushy eyebrows and his skin has a jaundiced look to it as if it has been stretched over bone. His most prominent features are his grey eyes that look as if they have cataracts. He is somewhat eccentric, a little cranky and impatient because all he wants is to be left alone. His function is the colony is that of historian and he sculpts coral statues of the ancestors and their stories in the Chamber of Remembrance. Tentus is a strong sender and receiver. When the threat of the Soul Stealer is upon them, he can sense it through nightmares which leave him drained, sick and helpless.
*[[Tilaweed]] female. Tilaweed is one of the oldest mer-elves in the WaveDancer colony. She is about 5 foot 10&amp;nbsp;inches with her tail. She carries herself with dignity as if she is of royal birth, but this is a natural quality rather than a false persona. She has long golden blonde hair and large ice blue eyes, and wears a girdle and head-dress of pearls and shells. Her tail is a green blue with some pink through her fin. She possesses many great talents. She is a musician: she has a beautiful lyrical voice that can soothe the soul and lull the mind, but she rarely chooses to sing because she mourns for her lost Child of Recognition. Tilaweed is estranged from her soul-mate Hyfus. She is a loner and tends to be secretive, but her glamorous facade hides her sensitivity and pain. Tilaweed spends her time equally above and below water though she can never venture on land because of her tail.
*[[Zadori]] female. Zadori is the mother of Shoresprout and the lovemate of Burdekin. She is also the daughter of Maron and is a sixth generation WaveDancer. Even though she is quite young, she is a traditionalist not given to forward thinking. Zadori is long, sleek and sensuous, and has silver white hair and blue eyes. She is also one of the Storytellers in the community.

==Elves of other or unknown tribes==
*[[Ekuar]] (male, rockshaper) part of an ancient group of elves (probably of the second generation), he was captured by trolls and used for his rockshaping skills, with dismemberment serving as punishment for disobedience. Thus he lacks an arm, a leg, and several fingers. Mentor and adviser to Rayek.
*[[Mekda]] (female, rockshaper, deceased) part of an ancient group of elves (second generation or thereabouts), she was captured by trolls and used for her rockshaping skills, with dismemberment serving as punishment for disobedience. After literally centuries, she became little more than a mindless tool, named Bag-of-Bones. Finally employed by Guttlekraw to force his way into the Go-Back's lodge and strike at their children; she died of cold exposure in the act, and was found by Ekuar.
*[[Osek (Elfquest)|Osek]] (male, rockshaper, deceased) part of an ancient group of elves (second generation or thereabouts), he was captured by trolls and used for his rockshaping skills, but managed to escape into the desert surrounding Sorrow's End. His final act was shaping a niche in a sheer cliff wall, to crawl in and die. This niche was later found by Suntop through his magic sense.
*[[Teir]] (male, possibly of Go-Back descent) has prodigious skills in animal bonding. Story clues indicate his birth tribe may be descended from the Go-Backs. He is lifemated to the new Wolfrider chief Ember, after a long, difficult competition with her lovemate Mender. His appearance is similar to the famed meeting of Chieftess Huntress Skyfire and her lifemate Dreamsinger, who they both physically resemble in kind.

==Half troll, half elf==

(It is possible Vol is meant to be Lord Voll; his memories in &quot;Siege At Blue Mountain&quot; invoke the images of elves who look like Gibra and Deir.)
*'''Guin''' - killed during the humans' first assault, a close friend of Haken's.
*'''Haken''' - Timmain's nemesis, possible ancestor of Winnowill or Rayek. He wanted to conquer the humans. He was Gibra's opposite, Passion, pushing them forward. He was mutilated and banished by Timmain. It is not known what became of him. Black hair, dark skin, and yellow eyes.

Even more elves, such as Rellah, Enlet, Almeck, Nefahrin, Menolan, Seeree, Oraynah, Marreck and Jennah are mentioned in the &quot;Blood Of Ten Chiefs&quot; collaboration novels edited by Richard Pini.

==Preserver==
Preservers are mentioned by the original High Ones to be the descendants of some sort of goodnatured insect or bug-like creature, that evolved for the better with their influence. They are immortal and cannot reproduce, but seem to be entirely indestructible except for their colorful wings. They are famed for their inherent ability to produce &quot;wrapstuff&quot;, a weblike material that renders those completely cocooned into a timeless sleep state until the webbing is torn.
*[[Petalwing]] - notoriously poor singer, and by virtue of its (preservers don't have a gender) big mouth, their de facto leader. It follows the &quot;highthings&quot; in order to protect them, since they refuse its constant offerings to be put into safe &quot;wrapstuff&quot;.
*Tittersweet
*Berrybuzz
*Bitterscreech
*Willowsnap
*Littlesky
*Bumbleclaw
*Tickletoe

== Trolls  ==

Trolls are immortal, brought by the original High Ones as 'pets'. Their evolution was not a pleasant one, and they became ape-like, childish creature with a penchant for cruelty. It is the fault of Trolls that the Palace crashed. Their descendants are much larger and more intelligent, the latter by barely.

==Greymung's Trolls==

*'''Greymung''' - Was King of the Holt Trolls after refusing to leave at the command of Guttlekraw, rebelling and driving him and his followers away. Was killed when Guttlekraw's force returned in force years later. Greymung was the facilitator of the Original Quest when he tricked Cutter and his Wolfriders into the desert in the hopes of killing them once and for all.
*'''Old Maggoty''' - The oldest known Troll, knowledgeable in herbal lore, Oddbit's granny and great granny of Trinket. Rumored an old concubine of Guttlekraw when she was young. She is much more levelheaded than her fellow female Trolls, and interacts well with elves.
*'''Oddbit''' - A maiden who is an opportunist of considerable enterprise, and the love interest of Picknose. She has been a concubine of both Greymung and Guttlekraw. Assumed mother of Trinket and many others, she has shown pity to elve's &quot;stupidity&quot; and &quot;ugliness&quot; on more than one occasion. She is extraordinarily self-centered, even for a Troll. She has curly blonde hair.
*'''Picknose''' - A soldier of the Holt Trolls. Was one of the few to escape when the colony was invaded. He was told of a treasure trove to which a key in the hilt of Cutter's sword provided access. After failing to gain the key, he and his companions went up north anyway to find the treasure and were caught and enslaved in the attempt. When the Wolfriders and Go-Backs invaded the tunnels of Guttlekraw's realm, they freed Picknose and the other Holt Trolls and formed an alliance that overthrew Guttlekraw and established Picknose as King. He lost the throne while gambling and hooked up with the Wolfriders who eventually allowed him to establish a colony of his own. According to the Pinis, his name comes not from any unsavory habit but from the fact that his nose resembles a [[pickaxe]].
*'''Scurff''' - (sometimes name is given as Scurfball) - King Greymung's doorkeeper. Tried to prevent the Wolfriders from entering the caverns when the Holt was burned down, but was &quot;persuaded&quot; to let them in by Cutter.
*'''Trinket''' - daughter of Oddbit and Picknose. She has a strange liking for elves, especially Mender. Was Taken by Rayek in the palace.

==Guttlekraw's Trolls==
*[[King Guttlekraw]] - Ancient King of the Trolls of Frozen Mountain. Had a fanatical hatred for Elves, possibly encouraged by Two-Edge. This hate extended to keeping rockshaping elves in brutal slavery and worked to permanently seal the [[Palace of the High Ones]] from all access. He wears a crown of elf fingers taken from captives and it is hinted that he has eaten elf flesh. He was going to torture the [[Go-Back]], Vaya, for the elves' secrets, but she made an attempt on his life and was executed. Was defeated and killed at the hands of the Go-Backs, Wolfriders and the Holt Trolls. He was devoured by the wolves.

==Monster==
*[[Madcoil]] - A murderous monster accidentally created when a wildcat and a large snake, locked in mortal combat, disturbed a pool of decayed magic that was also hit with lightning at that exact moment. That combination of elements created the monster with a senseless lust for murder using its massive size, claws and psionic powers to confuse its prey to its advantage. Apparently, it attacked both the human colonies and the Wolfriders, causing numerous deaths before it was defeated and killed by the Elves under the leadership of Cutter. Regardless, the humans accused the Elves of deliberately creating the creature to bedevil them.  It was later revealed that the mutual hatred between Bearclaw and a human chief had partially reawakened the spell and fueled the monster's rage.
