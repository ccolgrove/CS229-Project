''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', a spin-off of the crime drama ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', follows the detectives who work in the &quot;Special Victims Unit&quot; of the 16th District, [[New York City Police Department]], a unit that focuses on crimes involving [[rape]], [[sexual assault]] and [[child molestation]], as well as any crime loosely connected with any of the three, such as [[domestic violence]], [[kidnapping]] and [[child abandonment]]. Since its debut in September 1999, the series has generally shown four detectives working the unit, though at times, five, under the leadership of Captain [[Donald Cragen]]. The unit also has a prosecutor assigned from the DA's office, and frequently interacts with specific medical examiners and the unit's psychiatrist [[George Huang (Law &amp; Order)|George Huang]].

Three of the regular characters have appeared in three other NBC series: Captain [[Donald Cragen]] (Florek), who was on the first three seasons of ''Law &amp; Order'', Sergeant [[John Munch]] (Belzer), formerly a [[Baltimore Police Department|Baltimore]] detective on ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]].'' This character also made appearances on ''Law &amp; Order'', ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[The Beat (TV series)|The Beat]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'' and the [[HBO]] series ''[[The Wire]]''. [[Alexandra Cabot]] (March) was a lead character in the first and only season of ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'' where she had been promoted to Bureau Chief Executive ADA.

==Creation and conception==

The characters of [[Olivia Benson]] and [[Elliot Stabler]] were named for creator [[Dick Wolf]]'s children. Wolf's third child, daughter Sarina, had a character named for her, Benson's mother was named Serena, as well as former ADA [[Serena Southerlyn]] on the original ''Law &amp; Order'' and Det. [[Serena Stevens]] on ''Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent''.

She is tough, [[empathy|empathetic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kukoff |first=David |authorlink= |title=Vault Guide to Television Writing Careers |publisher=Vault, Inc. |year=2006 |isbn=1581313713 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; and completely dedicated to her job, to the point that she is seen as having no personal life. Her dedication sometimes wreaks havoc on her emotional state as she empathizes with victims of [[sexual assault]], having been the child of rape and later the victim of sexual assault while undercover. She has allowed her compassion for victims of abuse to sometimes cloud her professional judgment and impede her ability to remain impartial. Hargitay has received both a [[Golden Globe]] and an [[Emmy Award]] for her portrayal of Benson.

===John Munch===
{{main|John Munch}}
*Portrayed by [[Richard Belzer]]
*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 1)#ep1|Payback]]&quot; â ''present''

John Munch was a detective and now a Sergeant, in the Manhattan Special Victims Unit. A conspiracy theorist and dedicated detective, Munch is first partnered with [[Brian Cassidy]] ([[Dean Winters]]), whom he thinks of as a kind of younger brother, alternately poking fun at him and imparting (often questionable) advice on life and women. When Cassidy leaves the precinct in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' episode &quot;Disrobed&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Munch is briefly partnered with [[Monique Jeffries]] ([[Michelle Hurd]]),&lt;ref&gt;''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' episode &quot;Limitations&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and then with Odafin Tutuola (Ice-T).&lt;ref&gt;''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' episode &quot;Honor&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He and the gruff, uncompromising Tutuola get off to a rough start, but gradually came to like and respect each other.

The character was first created for the NBC police drama ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', where he worked as a homicide detective with the [[Baltimore Police Department]]. The character was based on [[Jay Landsman]], a central figure in [[David Simon (writer)|David Simon]]'s true crime book ''[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]]'', a documentary account of the homicide unit's operation over one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOM&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=David|year=1991, 2006|title=Homicide, A Year on the Killing Streets|publisher=Owl Books|location=New York|page=hoto insert section}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the series cancellation in 1999, the character was transferred to ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'', having appeared within the original ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' in [[Fictional crossover|cross-over]] episodes. Within the series, it is eventually said he left Baltimore after his wife cheated on him with a friend. Munch has been the only fictional character played by a single actor to appear on eight different television shows: ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', ''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'', ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'', ''[[The X-Files]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[The Beat (TV series)|The Beat]]'' and ''[[The Wire]]''.

{{main|Fin Tutuola}}
*Portrayed by [[Ice-T]]

He transferred out of narcotics after his partner was shot. He initially has a rocky relationship with his colleagues in SVU, especially his partner John Munch and [[Olivia Benson]]. He sees the world in [[black-and-white|black and white]], with all criminals equally deserving of [[prison]] regardless of extenuating circumstances. He also keeps a tight rein on his emotions, refusing to talk about his problems or to admit that the grisly nature of his work often affects him. He rarely talks about his personal life, not revealing he has a son to his fellow detectives until the sixth season. As the series progresses, he becomes closer with Munch and saves Benson from being raped. However, he also begins clashing more frequently with fellow detective Elliot Stabler. As of the Season 8 episode &quot;Screwed&quot;, he is assigned [[Chester Lake (Law &amp; Order)|Chester Lake]] as his new partner. After Lake kills a suspect, Stabler accuses Tutuola  of tipping him off before he is taken into custody, and checks his phone records.  Tutuola admits he called Lake, but says he did not expect him to run. Stabler quasi-apologizes for not trusting him, but Tutuola dismisses his apology because he believes Stabler will always be the same &quot;bulldog&quot;. Afterwards, he requests a transfer from the squad, however the man in charge of transfers is a former colleague of Tutuola's who holds a grudge against him. Tutuola resolves himself to being &quot;stuck&quot; and his captain, [[Don Cragen]], orders him to investigate a case with Stabler, who he calls a &quot;headcase&quot; and &quot;cranky-balls&quot;. In more recent episodes, Tutuola has again warmed to Stabler. In 2009's &quot;Solitary&quot;, when a suspect injures Stabler, Tutuola nearly throttles the suspect for attacking his &quot;friend&quot;.

*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 1)#ep1|Payback]]&quot; â ''present''

Donald Cragen is the Captain of the Special Victims Unit. A former homicide detective, he is portrayed as a somewhat stern but understanding father figure to the detectives who work under him and he gives them a great deal of leniency because he trusts their ability to get results, although he had an early habit of haranguing them about the weaknesses of their investigations. He was an  [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] for much of his early career, but goes [[sobriety|sober]] after pulling his service revolver on a taxi driver in a drunken rage. He has remained sober since, even after the death of his wife in a plane crash. Florek originally portrayed the character from 1990 to 1993 in the original ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' series. In that series, Cragen was investigated by [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] for [[police corruption|corruption]].

Amaro is a firm believer in divorce, and in &quot;Russian Brides&quot;, he tells Olivia that his parents had an abusive relationship where his father abused his mother before he walked out of their lives and moved to [[Miami, FL]] when he was young.

*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 1)#ep1|Payback]]&quot; â &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 1)#ep13|Disrobed]]&quot;

Brian Cassidy was a detective in the SVU during the series' first season. The youngest and least experienced member of the precinct, he has a genuine desire to put [[rape|rapists]] and [[child sexual abuse|child molesters]] in [[prison]], but lacked the professional detachment necessary to deal with the often grisly sex crimes. He often has trouble concealing his anger and revulsion toward the cases he investigates and this created friction between him and his colleagues, made worse when they poke fun at his relative lack of sophistication. A genuinely talented and driven police detective, he makes a real effort to learn from the other members of the precinct, particularly Munch, whom he thinks of as a sort of older brother/mentor figure. He has a brief affair with [[Olivia Benson]], and has trouble dealing with her after the relationship ends.  Cassidy was written out of the show midway through the first season. Cragen sends him to interview a young girl who was repeatedly raped and brutalized, causing Cassidy to realize that he cannot emotionally handle the types of crimes that a SVU detective must deal with on a daily basis.  Cragen then offers to assist Cassidy with a transfer to another department, narcotics.

===Danielle Beck===
*Portrayed by [[Connie Nielsen]]
*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 8)#ep2|Clock]]&quot; â &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 8)#ep8|Cage]]&quot;

Detective Danielle &quot;Dani&quot; Beck was Detective Olivia Benson's temporary replacement in season 8, while Benson was on an undercover assignment ([[Mariska Hargitay]] was on maternity leave). Dani had a husband, a cop named Mike Dooley, who was shot and killed in the line of duty.  Off to a rocky start at first, she and Stabler eventually gained a mutual respect for one another.  A turning point in their relationship occurred when they shared a passionate kiss after celebrating a case at a bar, although post-kiss nothing more than increased sexual chemistry was ever implied.  Following a case involving [[child abuse]] in which a traumatized adopted girl, whom Beck had been caring for, attempted to burn down her apartment and kill them both, Beck said to Stabler she could not stand working in the Special Victims Unit anymore unless he asked her to stay.  Stabler reluctantly said he could not make that decision for her, so Dani decided it would be best to return to her old post at the Warrants squad. Hargitay returned to her role as Benson in the following episode.

*Portrayed by [[B.D. Wong]]

Dr. Huang is an FBI [[forensic psychiatrist]] and [[criminal profiler]], specializing in studying sexual predators and their victims.  Though he is liked and respected by the SVU detectives and they generally defer to his professional judgment, his diagnoses sometimes hinder prosecutions, particularly where he finds mental illness, making defendants either not fully responsible for their crimes, or not fit to stand trial.  He frequently observes interrogations of suspects, advising detectives on how to best interact to obtain a confession.  Very little is known about Huang's personal life, other than that he is [[homosexual|gay]], which he noted in &quot;Hardwired&quot;, has a sister (noted in &quot;Inheritance&quot;), and that he speaks [[Cantonese]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].

===Melinda Warner===
{{main|Melinda Warner}}

Dr. Warner is the NYC [[medical examiner]]. She served as a doctor in the [[U.S. Air Force]] during the [[Gulf War]].  She is married and has a teenaged daughter.  Though originally a recurring character she more recently became a regular cast member, and was most prominently featured in the episodes &quot;Blast&quot; and &quot;Harm&quot;, the former seeing her becoming directly involved, through a series of circumstances, in the efforts to rescue an eight-year-old kidnapping victim who has just been diagnosed with [[leukemia]], and the latter seeing her testifying against another physician who is accused of helping the military to develop torture techniques.  She is well liked by most of the SVU staff, though briefly goes against Stabler when he accuses her of botching a DNA test on Benson, expected to absolve her of a homicide (the DNA is later discovered to have been intentionally doctored to make Benson look guilty).

===Emil Skoda===
{{main|Emil Skoda (Law &amp; Order)}}
*Portrayed by [[J.K. Simmons]]
*Episodes from: 2000â2001

Dr. Skoda is a psychiatrist who works with the New York Police Department. In addition to his own private practice, he often testifies for the prosecution as an expert witness on whether a defendant is legally sane to stand trial. He also profiles suspects and offers advice to the district attorneys regarding witnesses' and suspects' mental state.

Cabot first appears in the SVU episode &quot;Wrong Is Right&quot;, when she is hired to work with ''SVU'' as their permanent ADA. She survived an assassination attempt by a drug cartel's hitman and then entered the [[Witness Protection Program]]. She returned to testify against her assassin and she had returned to the DA's office in season 10. She also appeared in the short-lived ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' spinoff ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]''. Cabot was absent for the first four episodes of the 11th season to do some training in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in order to return to work with the ''SVU'' detectives by the fifth episode (&quot;Hardwired&quot;) after EADA Sonya Paxton entered court-ordered alcohol rehab. She left SVU in the season 11 episode &quot;Witness&quot; to work for the [[International Criminal Court]] to seek justice for rape victims in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  She later returned in &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;.

===Elizabeth Donnelly===
{{main|Elizabeth Donnelly}}
*Portrayed by [[Judith Light]]
*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)#ep1|Guilt]]&quot; â &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 10)#ep8|Persona]]&quot;
Elizabeth Donnelly was SVU's Bureau Chief Executive Assistant District Attorney for 12 episodes from season 3 to 6 and season 10. In the District Attorney's office, she serves as the supervisor for Cabot, and her successor Casey Novak. Donnelly is elevated to judge in season 7. In the season 10 episode &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 10)#ep8|Persona]]&quot;, Donnelly takes a leave of absence from her role as a judge and resumes her previous role as ADA, to prosecute a cold case she was involved with in the 1970s, when a battered woman ([[Brenda Blethyn]]) murdered her husband. She admits to Det. [[Olivia Benson]] that she was somewhat responsible for the woman absconding from custody and therefore took on the case due to &quot;unfinished business.&quot; Her role in the escape leads to mishaps in the justice system being termed &quot;doing a Donnelly&quot; for many years to follow. This episode calls attention to the difficulty Donnelly experiences as a woman working in the justice system. But the revelation that the fugitive had been pregnant at the time of her crime leads Donnelly to what, for her, is an act of leniency. She leaves the office, yet again, and returns to the role of a judge.

===Casey Novak===
{{main|Casey Novak}}
*Portrayed by [[Diane Neal]]
*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 5)#ep5|Serendipity]]&quot; â &quot;[[Cold (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|Cold]]&quot;, &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)#ep21|Reparations]]&quot;, &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 13)#ep3|Blood Brothers]]&quot; â ''present''

Casey Novak was ''SVUs'' Assistant District Attorney (Seasons 5â9), who replaced ADA Alex Cabot. Although she quickly loses her innocence when dealing with [[sex crime]]s, she still shows uneasiness when dealing with the gray areas of human involvement, preferring the letter of the law to the messiness of each individual reality. Nonetheless, Novak has a 71 percent success rate in the cases she prosecutes, whereas the average for prosecutors is 44 percent. After initial hesitation, she becomes particularly close to Stabler as they bond over being [[Catholic]] and a love for sports. It is revealed that in her final year of law school, Novak was engaged to a man (Charlie) who suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. She ended the relationship when his symptoms became so severe she felt she could no longer be intimate with him. In 2002, Charlie attacked her in her home during a [[psychotic episode]]. She convinced the police not to press charges, but ended the relationship. He eventually became [[homeless]], and was found dead as a &quot;[[John Doe]]&quot; in the spring of 2007. She developed a deep compassion for the mentally ill afterward, but still feels guilty for not being able to help him. She states that she is a big supporter of the U.S [[military]]. She says that her father was an M60 Door Gunner on a Huey during the [[Vietnam War]]. His helicopter crashed three times and he received a [[Purple Heart]]. In her final year as the SVU ADA, she grew increasingly more reckless and unsure in her prosecution. It is implied that friend and former boss [[Elizabeth Donnelly|Liz Donnelly]] aided in her censure, leading to her replacement by Kim Greylek.

It is revealed that Novak was censured for three years, and re-hired by the DA's office. This is explained in ''SVU'' episode &quot;Reparations&quot;, where she returns to SVU to prosecute a rape case, with ''[[Law &amp; Order: Los Angeles|Law &amp; Order: LA]]'' Deputy District Attorney [[List of Law &amp; Order: Los Angeles characters#Jonah Dekker|Jonah Dekker]] representing the defendant. Casey not only finds herself at odds with  Dekker, but also Judge Petrovsky, who she had previously lied to in  the season 9 finale (&quot;[[Cold (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|Cold]]&quot;), which ultimately led to her [[censure]].

===Kim Greylek===
*Portrayed by [[Michaela McManus]]
*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 10)#ep1|Trials]]&quot; â &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 10)#ep15|Lead]]&quot;

Kim Greylek was the SVU's [[Assistant District Attorney]] who replaced Casey Novak at the beginning of Season 10. Greylek previously worked in the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s [[Office on Violence Against Women]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] where she had the nickname of &quot;The Crusader.&quot; A dogged prosecutor, she pushed the detectives to make cases for the sake of politics in favor of pursuing actual offenders. She can be unrelenting, threatening to charge a defendant with a [[hate crime]] for [[rape|raping]] two women and of having a teenage boy charged with [[assault]]ing a police officer so he can be tested for [[HIV]]. After appearing in only 14 episodes, the character was written out of the series as having left the unit to return to Washington.  Greylek was replaced by former unit ADA Alexandra Cabot.

===Sonya Paxton===
*Portrayed by [[Christine Lahti]]
*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)#ep1|Unstable]]&quot; â &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)#ep4|Hammered]]&quot;, &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)#ep8|Turmoil]]&quot;, &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)#ep9|Gray]]&quot;, &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)#ep17|Pursuit]]&quot;

Sonya Paxton was ''SVU''s [[Executive Assistant District Attorney|Executive ADA]] who temporarily replaced [[Alexandra Cabot]] for four episodes in the 11th season, starting with the season premiere ([[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)|&quot;Unstable&quot;]]). Working in the [[Appeals court|Appeals bureau]], she was the first to get a [[Capital punishment|Capital Conviction]] in New York when the then newly-elected [[George Pataki|Governor Pataki]] brought back the death penalty in 1995. Paxton was sent down by [[Jack McCoy]] to 'clean the house' in the 'he-said, she-said unit' due to too many convictions being overturned.  However, things started out rocky as she butts heads with the ''SVU'' team, particularly [[Eliot Stabler|Detective Stabler]]. In the second episode of Season 11 ([[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)|&quot;Sugar&quot;]]) she and he get into a heated argument after Paxton calls the suspect's lawyer after he declines his right to counsel twice. In the fourth episode of the season ([[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)|&quot;Hammered&quot;]]), when a man drinks heavily and goes home and murders a woman he met at a bar, the defense blames [[alcoholism]] for the murder during the trial. Intending to use a computer-generated video mockup of the crime, Paxton accidentally plays a version in which the defendant's face is superimposed onto the attacker. The following morning, she arrives 45 minutes late to a mistrial hearing, appearing distraught and blaming a &quot;[[fender bender]]&quot;. [[Barry Moredock|Judge Moredock]]  asked if she would need medical help, but the defendant pointed out that she was drunk. Judge Moredock ordered Benson to come with a [[breathalyzer]], which revealed her blood alcohol level was .082, resulting in a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]]. The Judge ordered Paxton to seek treatment, prompting her temporary departure. At the end of &quot;Hammered&quot; she returns to the SVU squad and apologizes to the team, stating that she intends on making amends to each and every one of them.
  
She later appears in the episode [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)|&quot;Turmoil&quot;]], meeting Cabot outside the courtroom and telling her to watch out for Benson and Stabler, because they are only loyal to each other.

Sonya returned from her alcohol rehabilitation and served as an Executive ADA in the ninth episode ([[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)|&quot;Gray&quot;]]) of the 12th season to prove to the DA that she hadn't lost her 'winning ways'. In the seventeenth episode ([[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)|&quot;Pursuit&quot;]]), she returns again to help out an old friend Alicia Harding who starts receiving personal threats. Paxton was murdered during the episode while investigating the identity of the stalker. While he was attacking her, she was able to obtain his DNA by biting him - which ultimately helped solve the case.

===Jo Marlowe===
*Portrayed by [[Sharon Stone]]
*Episodes: &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)#ep21|Torch]]&quot; â &quot;[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)#ep24|Shattered]]&quot;

Jo Marlowe is drafted by [[Jack McCoy]] in the season 11 episode &quot;Torch&quot; after ADA Alexandra Cabot leaves to help rape victims in the Congo (&quot;Witness&quot;). A former [[lieutenant]], Marlowe had been Elliot Stabler's partner approximately four years before Benson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Torch |episodelink=Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)  |series=''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' |serieslink=Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit |credits= |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=April 28, 2010 |season=11 |minutes=2:45â2:50 |quote=Jo Marlow: Eliot frigging Stabler.

Sheâs been married before and has a lot of secrets.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvguidemagazine.com/kecks-exclusives/svus-bringing-sexy-back-3936.html|title= SVU's Bringing Sexy Back|last=Keck | first=William|work=TVGuide Magazine|publisher=OpenGate Capital|date=February 1, 2010| accessdate=February 4, 2010 &lt;!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nIg4C3QH|archivedate=February 4, 2010--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode &quot;Shattered&quot;, she reveals that she was diagnosed with an &quot;aggressive&quot; type of cancer and had a [[Radical mastectomy|bilateral radical mastectomy]] a year before joining the SVU squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Shattered|episodelink=Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 11)  |series=''Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit'' |serieslink=Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit |credits= |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=May 19, 2010 |season=11 |minutes=35:25â35:50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replacement for Mikka Von, she premieres mid-season. Hardwicke is a Brooklyn [[Assistant District Attorney|ADA]] who transfers to [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit|Manhattan SVU]] due to her great admiration for detectives Benson and Stabler. It is known that Hardwicke has had some previous experience with Benson, stating she did something for her and her family. She has a 92% conviction rate ([[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 12)|''SVU'': &quot;Branded&quot;]]).

Executive ADA Michael Cutter (''Law &amp; Order'') has been promoted to Bureau Chief Executive ADA and transferred to the Special Victims Unit where he is supervising the ADAs assigned to the precint. Show runner [[Warren Leight]] stated, &quot;If Cutter was a bit of a hot head in the past, the passage of time and some added responsibility in his new job has made him more mature, and perhaps a bit more jaded.&quot; Roache had to say, &quot;I learned a lot from my time on ''Law &amp; Order'' and it's going to be interesting to experiment with Cutter's development in this new context â I think Special Victims is going to be an area where Cutter's passion for justice can really come forth&quot;. The season 13 premiere episode, &quot;[[Scorched Earth (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|Scorched Earth]]&quot; was Cutter's first appearance on ''SVU''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CutterSVU&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanhope|first=Kate|title=Law &amp; Order Alum Linus Roache to Reprise Role on SVU|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/SVU-Linus-Roache-1036212.aspx|accessdate=August 8, 2011|newspaper=''[[TV Guide]]''|date=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
