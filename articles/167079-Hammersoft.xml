A '''smartphone''' is a high-end [[mobile phone]] built on a [[Mobile operating system|mobile computing]] platform, with more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary [[feature phone]].&lt;ref name=phonescoop-smartphone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonescoop.com/glossary/term.php?gid=131 |title=Smartphone |date= |publisher=''Phone Scoop'' |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=phonescoop-featurephone&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonescoop.com/glossary/term.php?gid=310 |title=Feature Phone |date= |publisher=''Phone Scoop'' |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/gadgetreviews/smartphone-vs-feature-phone-arms-race-heats-up-which-did-you-buy/6836 |title=Smartphone vs. feature phone arms race heats up; which did you buy? |author=Andrew Nusca |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=[[ZDNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first smartphones were devices that mainly combined the functions of a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) and a mobile phone or [[camera phone]]. Today's models also serve to combine the functions of [[portable media player]]s, low-end [[compact camera|compact]] [[digital cameras]], [[pocket video camera]]s, and [[GPS]] navigation units. Modern smartphones typically also include high-resolution [[touchscreen]]s, [[web browser]]s that can access and properly display standard web pages rather than just mobile-optimized sites, and high-speed data access via [[Wi-Fi]] and [[mobile broadband]].

The most common [[mobile operating system]]s (OS) used by modern smartphones include [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[Windows Mobile]] and [[Windows Phone]], [[Nokia|Nokia's]] [[Symbian]], [[Research In Motion|RIM's]] [[BlackBerry OS]], and [[embedded Linux]] distributions such as [[Maemo]] and [[MeeGo (operating system)|MeeGo]]. Such operating systems can be installed on many different phone models, and typically each device can receive multiple OS software updates over its lifetime.

The distinction between smartphones and feature phones can be vague and there is no official definition for what constitutes the difference between them. One of the most significant differences is that the advanced [[application  programming interface]]s (APIs) on smartphones for running third-party applications&lt;ref name=PCmag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=Smartphone&amp;i=51537,00.asp|title=Smartphone definition from PC Magazine Encyclopedia|work=[[PC Magazine]]|accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; can allow those applications to have better integration with the phone's OS and hardware than is typical with feature phones. In comparison, feature phones more commonly run on proprietary [[firmware]], with third-party software support through platforms such as [[Java ME]] or [[Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless|BREW]].&lt;ref name=phonescoop-smartphone/&gt; An additional complication in distinguishing between smartphones and feature phones is that over time the capabilities of new models of feature phones can increase to exceed those of phones that had been promoted as smartphones in the past.

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:IBM SImon in charging station.png|thumb|180px|[[IBM Simon]] (introduced 1992) shown in the charging station]]

The first smartphone was the [[IBM Simon]]; it was designed in 1992 and shown as a concept product&lt;ref&gt;Schneidawind, J:  &quot;Big Blue unveiling&quot;, ''USA Today'', November 23, 1992, page 2B&lt;/ref&gt; that year at [[COMDEX]], the computer industry trade show held in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], Nevada.  It was released to the public in 1993 and sold by [[BellSouth]].  Besides being a mobile phone, it also contained a calendar, address book, world clock, calculator, note pad, e-mail client, the ability to send and receive [[fax]]es, and games.  It had no physical buttons, instead customers used a [[touchscreen]] to select telephone numbers with a finger or create faxes and memos with an optional stylus.  Text was entered with a unique on-screen &quot;predictive&quot; keyboard.  By today's standards, the Simon would be a fairly low-end product, lacking a camera and the ability to download third-party applications.  However, its feature set at the time was highly advanced.

The [[Nokia Communicator]] line was the first of Nokia's smartphones starting with the [[Nokia 9000]], released in 1996. This distinctive palmtop computer style smartphone was the result of a collaborative effort of an early successful and costly [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) by [[Hewlett-Packard]] combined with Nokia's best-selling phone around that time, and early prototype models had the two devices fixed via a hinge. The Communicators are characterized by a [[clamshell design]], with a feature phone display, keyboard and user interface on top of the phone, and a physical QWERTY keyboard, high-resolution display of at least 640Ã200 pixels and PDA user interface under the flip-top. The software was based on the [[GEOS V3.0]] operating system, featuring email communication and text-based web browsing. In 1998, it was followed by [[Nokia 9110]], and in 2000 by [[Nokia 9110i]], with improved web browsing capability.

In 1997 the term 'smartphone' was used for the first time when [[Ericsson]] unveiled the concept phone GS88,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pws.prserv.net/Eri_no_moto/GS88_Preview.htm | title=Ericsson GS88 Preview | publisher=''Eri-no-moto'' | accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stockholmsmartphone.org/history/ | title=History | publisher=Stockholm Smartphone | accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first device labelled as 'smartphone'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stockholmsmartphone.org/wp-content/uploads/penelope-box.jpg | title=Ericsson GS88 box | accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbian===
[[File:Nokia 9210.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[Nokia 9210 Communicator]] ([[Symbian]] 2000 model smartphone)]]

In 2000, the touchscreen [[Ericsson R380|Ericsson R380 Smartphone]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geek.com/hwswrev/pda/ericr380/ | title=PDA Review: Ericsson R380 Smartphone | publisher=''Geek.com'' | accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first device to use an open operating system, the [[Symbian OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.i-symbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Symbian_Evolution.pdf | title= Symbian Device â The OS Evolution |publisher=''Independent Symbian Blog'' | accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first device marketed as a 'smartphone'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mobilemag.com/2001/09/25/ericsson-introduces-the-new-r380e | title=Ericsson Introduces The New R380e | publisher=''Mobile Magazine'' | accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It combined the functions of a mobile phone and a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,40827,00.asp | title=Ericsson R380 World, Review &amp; Rating | publisher=''PCMag.com'' | accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1999 the magazine [[Popular Science]] appointed the Ericsson R380 Smartphone to one of the most important advances in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8qSgh_Q-YOkC | title=Popular Science, December 1999 | publisher=''Google Books'' | accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a groundbreaking device since it was as small and light as a normal mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cellular.co.za/ericsson_r380.htm | title=Ericsson R380 PDA &amp; Phone | publisher=''CellularOnline'' | accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 it was followed up by [[Sony Ericsson P800|P800]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/features/item/Sony_Ericsson_P800.php | title=Sony Ericsson P800 | publisher=''All About Symbian'' | accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2000, the [[Nokia 9210 communicator]] was introduced, which was the first color screen model from the [[Nokia Communicator]] line. It was a true smartphone with an open operating system, the [[Symbian OS]]. It was followed by the [[Nokia 9500|9500]] Communicator, which also was Nokia's first cameraphone and first [[Wi-Fi]] phone.  The [[Nokia 9300|9300]] Communicator was smaller, and the latest [[Nokia E90|E90]] Communicator includes [[GPS]].  The Nokia Communicator model is remarkable for also having been the most costly phone model sold by a major brand for almost the full life of the model series, costing easily 20% and sometimes 40% more than the next most expensive smartphone by any major producer.

In 2007 Nokia launched the [[Nokia N95]] which integrated a wide range of multimedia features into a consumer-oriented smartphone: GPS, a 5 megapixel camera with [[autofocus]] and LED flash, 3G and [[Wi-Fi]] connectivity and [[TV-out]]. In the next few years these features would become standard on high-end smartphones. The [[Nokia 6110 Navigator]] is a Symbian based dedicated [[GPS phone]] introduced in June 2007.

In 2010 Nokia released the [[Nokia N8]] smartphone with a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]]-free capacitive touchscreen, the first device to use the new [[Symbian^3]] OS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nokia.co.uk/n8 | title= Nokia N8 smartphone official site}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a 12 [[megapixel]] camera with [[Flashtube#Xenon|Xenon]] flash capable of recording [[High-definition video|HD video]] in [[720p]], described by Mobile Burn as the best camera in a phone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobileburn.com/review.jsp?Id=11093 |title=Nokia N8 review - best camera phone ever |publisher=Mobileburn.com |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and satellite navigation that Mobile Choice described as the best on any phone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilechoiceuk.com/News/MOBILE+CHOICE+AWARD:+Best+Sat-Nav/5274Mobilechoiceuk.com ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured a front-facing [[VGA]] camera for videoconferencing.

Symbian was the number one smartphone platform by market share from 1996 until 2011 when it dropped to second place behind Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android OS]]. In February 2011, Nokia announced that it would replace Symbian with [[Windows Phone]] as the operating system on all of its future smartphones.&lt;ref name=NokiaWinPho7&gt;{{cite news|author=The Associated Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/02/11/nokia-microsoft-smart-phone-apple-google.html |title=Nokia, Microsoft in pact to rival Apple, Google - Technology &amp; Science |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transition was completed in October 2011, when Nokia announced its first line of Windows Phone 7.5 smartphones, [[Nokia Lumia 710|Lumia 710]] and [[Nokia Lumia 800|800]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/26/nokia-debuts-lumia-710-and-lumia-800/|title=Nokia Debuts Their First Windows Phones: The Lumia 800 and Lumia 710|last=Velazco|first=Chris|date=26 October 2011|work=TechCruch|accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palm, Windows, and BlackBerry ===
[[File:Htc Touch Pro2 Georgy.JPG|thumb|180px|The [[HTC Touch Pro2]] smartphone (May 2009)]]

In the late 1990s the vast majority of mobile phones had only basic phone features and many people who needed functionality beyond that also carried [[PDA]] and/or [[pager]] type devices running early versions of operating systems such as [[Palm OS]], [[BlackBerry OS]] or [[Windows CE]]/[[Pocket PC]].&lt;ref name=phonescoop-smartphone/&gt; Later versions of these systems started integrating cell phone capabilities with their PDA and messaging features and support of third-party applications. Today, high-end devices running these systems are often branded smartphones.

In early 2001, [[Palm, Inc.]] introduced the [[Kyocera 6035]], the first smartphone to be deployed in widespread use in the United States. This device combined the features of a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) with a wireless phone that operated on the [[Verizon Wireless]] network. For example, a user could select a name from the PDA [[contact list]], and the device would dial that contact's phone number. The device also supported limited web browsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palminfocenter.com/view_story.asp?ID=1707 |title=Kyocera QCP 6035 Smartphone Review |publisher=Palminfocenter.com |date=2001-03-16 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device received a very positive reception from technology publications, but the product line never became widespread outside North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Segan |first=Sascha |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2361664,00.asp |title=Kyocera Launches First Smartphone In Years &amp;#124; News &amp; Opinion |publisher=PCmag.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Microsoft announced its [[Windows CE]] Pocket PC OS would be offered as &quot;Microsoft Windows Powered Smartphone 2002.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/Jan02/01-08msces.mspx |title=Better Living through Software: Microsoft Advances for the Home Highlighted at Consumer Electronics Show 2002: Microsoft showcases new and improved products -- including &quot;Freestyle,&quot; &quot;Mira&quot; and Ultimate TV at International CES 2002 |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2002-01-08 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft originally defined its [[Windows Mobile|Windows Smartphone]] products as lacking a touchscreen and offering a lower screen resolution compared to its sibling Pocket PC devices.

In early 2002 [[Handspring (company)|Handspring]] released the [[Palm OS]] [[Palm Treo|Treo]] smartphone, utilizing a full keyboard that combined wireless web browsing, email, calendar, and contact organizer with mobile third-party applications that could be downloaded or synced with a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/nov2001/nf20011129_0157.htm |title=Handspring's Breakthrough Hybrid |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2001-11-30 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 [[Research In Motion|RIM]] released their first [[BlackBerry]] devices with integrated phone functionality and shifted the positioning of their products from 2-way pagers to email-capable mobile phones. The [[List of BlackBerry products|BlackBerry line]] evolved into the first smartphone optimized for wireless email use and had achieved a total customer base of about 32 million subscribers by December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin McLaughlin |url=http://www.crn.com/mobile/222002587;jsessionid=DTFGA1NIW4DPVQE1GHRSKH4ATMY32JVN |title=BlackBerry Users Call For RIM To Rethink Service |publisher=CRN.com |date=2009-12-17 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 Nokia announced a plan to make Microsoft [[Windows Phone]] its main operating system of choice for new Nokia smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2011/02/11/nokia-microsoft-smart-phone-apple-google.html |title=Nokia, Microsoft in pact to rival Apple, Google - Technology &amp; Science |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== iPhone ===
[[File:Original iPhone docked.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[iPhone (original)|original iPhone]] (June 2007)]]

In 2007, [[Apple Inc.]] introduced its first [[iPhone (original)|iPhone]]. It was initially costly, priced at $499 for the cheaper of two models on top of a two year contract. The first mobile phone to use a [[multi-touch]] interface, the iPhone was notable for its use of a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction, instead of having a [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]], keyboard, and/or keypad, which were the typical input methods for other smartphones at the time. The iPhone featured a web browser that ''[[Ars Technica]]'' then described as &quot;far superior&quot; to anything offered by that of its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2007/07/iphone-review.ars/6|title=iPhone in depth: the Ars review|page=6|work=[[ArsTechnica]]|publisher=[[CondÃ© Nast Publications|CondÃ© Nast]]|date=9 July 2007|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially lacking the capability to install native applications beyond the ones built-in to its OS, at [[Worldwide Developers Conference#WWDC 2007|WWDC]] in June 2007 Apple announced that the iPhone would support [[third-party developer|third-party]] &quot;web 2.0 applications&quot; running in its web browser that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/11iphone.html|title=iPhone to Support Third-Party Web 2.0 Applications|work=Press Release|date=June 11, 2007|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the iPhone's initial inability to install third-party native applications, some reviewers did not consider the originally released device to accurately fit the definition of a smartphone &quot;by conventional terms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-iphone-is-not-a-smartphone/|title=The iPhone is not a smartphone|date=9 January 2007|accessdate=11 July 2010|publisher=Engadget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process called [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking]] emerged quickly to provide unofficial third-party native applications.  There are many different functions of the iPhone including a GPS unit, kitchen timer, radio, map book, calendar, notepad, and many other features that replace objects we have to carry around each day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simpleorganizedlife.com/smartphones-can-replace-these-everyday-items/|13 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows for more ease in everyday life.  For example, a college student can now keep track of every task and have all the gadgets he or she needs to function in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panetworks.net/how-smart-phones-can-help-you-in-your-everyday-life.html|13 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Apple introduced its second generation [[iPhone 3G|iPhone]] with a lower list price starting at $199 and 3G support. Released with it, Apple also created the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], adding the capability for any [[iPhone]] or [[iPod Touch]] to officially execute additional native applications (both free and paid) installed directly over a [[Wi-Fi]] or cellular network, without the more typical process at the time of requiring a PC for installation. Applications could additionally be browsed through and downloaded directly via the [[iTunes]] software client on [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] PCs, rather than by searching through multiple sites across the Internet. Featuring over 500 applications at launch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/07/10iphone.html|title=iPhone 3G on Sale Tomorrow|date=2008-07-10|publisher=Apple Inc.|work=Press Release|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's App Store was immediately very popular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/07/14appstore.html|title=iPhone App Store Downloads Top 10 Million in First Weekend|date=2008-07-14|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|work=Press Release|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; quickly growing to become a huge success&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2009/07/14Apples-App-Store-Downloads-Top-1-5-Billion-in-First-Year.html|title=Appleâs App Store Downloads Top 1.5 Billion in First Year|date=2009-07-14|publisher=Apple Inc.|work=Press Release|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/07/07Apples-App-Store-Downloads-Top-15-Billion.html|title=Apple's App Store Downloads Top 15 Billion|work=Press Release|accessdate=2011-07-07|date=2011-07-07|publisher=Apple Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inspiring other smartphone makers to [[List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices|copy its model]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Smartphone#Application stores]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June of 2010, Apple introduced iOS 4, which included APIs to allow third-party applications to multitask,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/11/apple-now-accepting-ios-4-apps-multitasking-ahoy/|title=Apple now accepting iOS 4 apps, multitasking ahoy|accessdate=21 April 2010|date=11 June 2010|publisher=Engadget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[iPhone 4]], which included a 960Ã640 pixel display with a pixel density of 326 [[pixel density|pixels per inch]] (ppi), a 5 [[megapixel]] camera with [[LED flashlight|LED]] flash capable of recording [[High-definition video|HD video]] in [[720p]] at 30 [[Frame rate|frames per second]], a front-facing [[VGA]] camera for videoconferencing, a 1 [[Hertz|GHz]] processor, and other improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/06/07Apple-Presents-iPhone-4.html|title=Apple Presents iPhone 4|date=2010-06-07|publisher=Apple Inc.|work=Press Release|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011 the iPhone 4 became available through [[Verizon Wireless]], ending [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]]'s exclusivity of the handset in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fasterforward/2011/01/liveblog_the_verizon_iphone.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Liveblog: The Verizon iPhone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmott |first=Mark |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/01/11/132833078/its-official-verizon-has-iphone-4 |title=It's Official: Verizon Has The iPhone 4 : The Two-Way |publisher=NPR |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703791904576075681886276172.html?mod=googlenews_wsj | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Shayndi | last=Raice | title=Verizon Unwraps iPhone | date= {{Start date|2011|01|12}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowing the handset's 3G connection to be used as a wireless [[Tethering|Wi-Fi hotspot]] for the first time, to up to 5 other devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/158058/2011/02/personal_hotspot_verizon.html | title=Using the Personal Hotspot on your Verizon iPhone | publisher=Macworld.com | author=Glenn Fleishman | date=2011-02-22 | accessdate=2011-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Software updates subsequently added this capability to other iPhones running iOS 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apple.com/ios/ | title=iOS 4.3 Software Update | publisher=Apple Inc. | accessdate=2011-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/158483/2011/03/firstlook_43.html | title=Hands on with iOS 4.3 | publisher=Macworld.com | author=Dan Moren | date=2011-03-11 | accessdate=2011-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are about 35 percent of Americans that have some sort of smartphone.  This shows that the market is spreading fast and there is also more capabilities for smartphones because of this spread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.boston.com/2011-11-12/business/30391540_1_smartphone-mobile-commerce-card-readers| 13 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Smartphones are also mainly valuable based on the operating system.  For example, the iPhone runs on the iOS and other devices run different operating sytems which makes the functionality of these systems different.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cellphones.about.com/od/smartphonebasics/a/what_is+_smart.htm| 13 November 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Android===
[[File:Galaxy Nexus smartphone.jpg|thumb|[[Galaxy Nexus]], the latest &quot;[[Google Nexus|Google phone]]&quot;]]
The [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system for smartphones was released in 2008. Android is an [[open source|open-source]] platform backed by [[Google]], along with major hardware and software developers (such as [[Intel]], [[HTC Corporation|HTC]], [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], [[Motorola]] and [[Samsung]], to name a few), that form the [[Open Handset Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=16 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phone to use [[Android (operating system)|Android]] was the [[HTC Dream]], branded for distribution by [[T-Mobile]] as the G1. The software suite included on the phone consists of integration with Google's proprietary applications, such as Maps, Calendar, and Gmail, and a full HTML web browser. Android supports the execution of native applications and a preemptive multitasking capability (in the form of services). Third-party apps are available via the [[Android Market]] (released October 2008), including both free and paid apps.

In January 2010, Google launched the [[Nexus One]] smartphone using its Android OS. Although Android has multi-touch abilities, Google initially removed that feature from the Nexus One,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techietrick.blogspot.com/2010/01/weighing-nexus-over-iphone-practical.html |title=Weighing Nexus over iPhone â a practical review for the everyday user! |publisher=Techietrick.blogspot.com |date=2010-01-06 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was added through a firmware update on February 2, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/02/nexus-one-gets-a-software-update-enables-multitouch |title=Nexus One gets a software update, enables multitouch (updated with video!) |publisher=Engadget.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the [[Xperia Play]] smartphone, an analyst at CCS Insight said in March 2011 that &quot;Console wars are moving to the mobile platform&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tarmo Virki |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/02/13/idINIndia-54865020110213 |title=Sony takes gaming console war to phones |publisher=Reuters |date=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the [[HTC EVO 3D]] was announced by [[HTC Corporation]], which can produce 3D effects with no need for special glasses ([[autostereoscopy]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.htc.com/www/product/evo3d/overview.html/ htc.com]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HTC EVO 3D was officially released  on June 24, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savov|first=Vlad|title=HTC Evo 3D Launches June 24th|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/06/htc-evo-3d-launches-on-june-24th-for-200-joined-by-evo-view-4g/|publisher=Engadget.com|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screen==
Screens on smartphones vary largely in both [[Two-dimensional display size|display size]] and [[display resolution]]. The most common screen sizes range from 2 inches to over 4 inches (measured diagonally). Some 5 inch screen devices exist that run on [[Mobile operating system|mobile OSes]] and have the ability to make phone calls, such as the discontinued [[Dell Streak]] and the current [[Samsung Galaxy Note]]. [[Ergonomics]] arguments have been made that increasing screen sizes start to negatively impact usability.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

[[List of displays by pixel density|Common resolutions]] for smartphone screens vary from 240Ã320 to 720Ã1280, with many [[Comparison of Android devices|flagship Android phones]] at 480Ã800 or 540Ã960, the [[iPhone 4]]/[[iPhone 4S|4S]] at 640Ã960 and [[Galaxy Nexus]] and [[HTC Rezound]] at 720Ã1280.

== Application stores ==

{{Main|List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices}}

The introduction of Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July 2008 popularized manufacturer-hosted [[List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices|online distribution]] for third-party applications focused on a single platform. Prior to this, smartphone application distribution was largely dependent on [[List of digital distribution platforms for mobile devices#Third-party platforms|third-party sources]] providing applications for multiple platforms, such as [[GetJar]], [[Handango]], [[Handmark]], [[PocketGear]], and others.

[[File:Global Mobile Applications Store Revenue.svg|Global Mobile Applications Store Revenue|300px|left]]

The iPhone's platform is officially restricted to installing apps only through Apple's App Store, though via [[IOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking]] it can install apps from other sources. Other platforms may allow application distribution through additional sources outside of their manufacturer-provided app stores, such as third-party app stores and downloads from individual websites.

Following the success of Apple's App Store other smartphone manufacturers quickly launched application stores of their own. [[Google]] launched the [[Android Market]] in October 2008. [[Research In Motion|RIM]] launched its app store, [[BlackBerry App World]], in April 2009. Nokia launched its [[Ovi Store]] in May 2009. Palm launched its [[Palm App Catalog]] for [[webOS]] in June 2009. Microsoft launched an application store for [[Windows Mobile]] called [[Windows Marketplace for Mobile]] in October 2009, and then a separate [[Windows Phone Marketplace]] for [[Windows Phone]] in October 2010. Samsung launched [[Samsung Apps]] for its [[bada]] based phones in June 2010. [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] launched its [[Amazon Appstore]] for the Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system in March 2011.

The relatively high revenue of U.S. $1782 million in 2010 for Apple's App Store compared to competitor's stores&lt;ref name=iOSscraps&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/18/rim_nokia_and_googles_android_battle_for_apples_ios_scraps_as_app_market_sales_grow_to_2_2_billion.html Apple's rivals battle for iOS scraps as app market sales grow to $2.2 billion]&lt;/ref&gt; can be attributed to a combination of factors. In large part this can be attributed to having the largest number of apps available and the highest download volume of any mobile app store in 2010, but besides that only 28% of the apps in Apple's App Store were free apps, compared to over 57% in the Android Market. Similarly, Nokia's Ovi Store and the BlackBerry App World both had only 26% of their apps available for free, but both generated higher revenues than the Android Market despite having much lower download volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/05/distimo-june-2010/ |title=Google Android has double the number of free apps than Apple's App Store |date=15 July 2009 |publisher=[[Distimo]] |accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malicious software attacks ==
{{Main|Malware|Mobile virus}}

As smartphone adoption goes up they have increasingly become subject to attacks by [[Malware|malicious software]] (malware).&lt;ref name=&quot;McAfeeAndroid&quot;&gt;[http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/08/23/mcafee.shows.android.facing.huge.spike.in.malware/ McAfee: Android malware surges 76%, iPhone untouched]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loopinsight.com/2011/11/16/android-sees-a-472-increase-in-malware-since-july/ Android sees a 472% increase in malware since July]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently this malware is distributed through application stores that have minimal or no review process for their content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juniper-malware&quot;&gt;[http://globalthreatcenter.com/?p=2492 Mobile Malware Development Continues To Rise, Android Leads The Way]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases malware has been hidden in [[Copyright infringement of software|pirated]] versions of legitimate apps, which are then distributed through 3rd party app stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/03/01/the-mother-of-all-android-malware-has-arrived-stolen-apps-released-to-the-market-that-root-your-phone-steal-your-data-and-open-backdoor/ |title = The Mother Of All Android Malware Has Arrived |work = Android Police |first = Android Police |date = March 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perez |first=Sarah |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/android_vulnerability_so_dangerous_shouldnt_use_web_browser.php |title=Android Vulnerability So Dangerous, Owners Warned Not to Use Phone's Web Browser |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malware risk also comes from what's known as an &quot;update attack,&quot; where a legitimate application is later changed to include a malware component, which users then install when they are notified that the app has been updated. Additionally, the ability to acquire software directly from links on the web results in a distribution vector called &quot;malvertizing,&quot; where users are directed to click on links, such as on ads that look legitimate, which then open in the device's web browser and cause malware to be downloaded and installed automatically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lookout-malware&quot;&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/03/lookout_retrevio_warn_of_growing_android_malware_epidemic_note_apples_ios_is_far_safer.html Lookout, Retrevo warn of growing Android malware epidemic, note Apple's iOS is far safer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical smartphone malware leverages platform vulnerabilities that allow it to [[Rootkit|gain root access]] on the device in the background. Using this access the malware installs additional software to target communications, location, or other [[spyware|personal identifying information]]. A common form of malware on mobile phones is the SMS [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]], which sends [[premium SMS]] messages, possibly while unknowingly running in the background of a legitimate application. These premium SMS messages run up charges on the owners phone bill which cannot be recovered.

In August 2010, [[Kaspersky|Kaspersky Lab]] reported detection of the first malicious program for smartphones running on Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]] operating system, named [[Trojan-SMS.AndroidOS.FakePlayer.a]], an SMS trojan which had already infected a number of devices using that OS.&lt;ref name=&quot;kaspersky&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=207576158 |title=First SMS Trojan detected for smartphones running Android |publisher=Kaspersky Lab |accessdate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the spring of 2011 Android malware increased 76%,  according to [[McAfee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McAfeeAndroid&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iOS-unaffected-by-malware&quot;&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/24/apples_ios_unaffected_by_malware_as_android_exploits_surge_76.html Apple's iOS unaffected by malware as Android exploits surge 76%]&lt;/ref&gt; A report from [[Juniper Global Threat Center]] notes that malware on the Android platform increased 400% from 2009 to the summer of 2010, and then saw a 472% increase between July and November 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juniper-malware&quot;/&gt; The Juniper report indicates that 55% of Android malware acts as [[spyware]], and 44% are SMS trojans.

While there have been and continue to be potential security flaws in iOS,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/11/07/newly_found_code_signing_flaw_allows_for_ios_malware.html Security researcher finds code signing flaw that opens door for iOS malware]&lt;/ref&gt; as of at least August 2011 there were no known malware or spyware apps in Apple's App Store, according to security firm Lookout. There are however commercial spyware applications available, outside the App Store, for jailbroken iOS devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lookout-malware&quot;/&gt; In June 2011 [[Symantec|Symantec's]] 23-page report &quot;A Window Into Mobile Device Security&quot; characterized (non-jailbroken) devices running iOS as having &quot;full protection&quot; against malware attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/06/28/apples_ios_more_secure_than_googles_android_says_symantec.html Apple's iOS more secure than Google's Android, says Symantec]&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbian and older versions Windows Mobile have had to contend with a degree of malware in the past, but as legacy systems it is believed that the people who previously targeted them have shifted their focus to Android.&lt;ref name=&quot;Juniper-malware&quot;/&gt; There were also a few [[Palm OS viruses]].

The only mobile platform other than Apple's iOS without reports of malware so far is HP's (formerly Palm's) webOS, but this may be explained by its relatively low adoption rate.&lt;ref name=&quot;iOS-unaffected-by-malware&quot;/&gt;

The best way to reduce a device's [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]] to malware attacks is to install the most recent versions of operating systems which include [[Patch (computing)|security patches]]. This can be complicated by long delays&lt;ref&gt;[http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support the understatement: Android Orphans: Visualizing a Sad History of Support]&lt;/ref&gt; in software updates for many devices which have had their software modified with custom &quot;skins,&quot; services, or promotional on-deck apps by their manufacturer or mobile carrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lookout-malware&quot;/&gt; In some cases a device may no longer be receiving updates from its manufacturer or carrier, leaving it vulnerable to exploits that have been patched in an OS version that's more recent than the device's last supported one.

== Market share ==
===Smartphone market share===

For several years, demand for advanced mobile devices boasting powerful [[microprocessor|processors]] and [[graphics processing unit]]s, abundant [[non-volatile memory|storage]] ([[flash memory]]) for applications and media files, high-resolution screens with [[multi-touch]] capability, and open operating systems has outpaced the rest of the mobile phone market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.deloitte.co.uk/TMTPredictions/telecommunications/Smartphones-clever-in-downturn.cfm |title= Smart phones: how to stay clever in downturn |work=Deloitte Telecommunications Predictions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an early 2010 study by ComScore, over 45.5 million people in the United States owned smartphones out of 234 million total subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://bmighty.informationweek.com/mobile/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=224201881 |title= Android Phones Steal Market Share}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the large increase in smartphone sales in the last few years, smartphone shipments only made up 20% of total handset shipments as of the first half of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.visionmobile.com/blog/2010/10/smart-feature-phones-the-unbalanced-equation-100-million-club-series/ |title= 100 Million Club â H1 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gartner in their report dated November 2010, total smartphone sales doubled in one year and now smartphones represent 19.3 percent of total mobile phone sales.&lt;ref name=Gartner_Q3_2010/&gt; Smartphone sales increased in 2010 by 72.1 percent from the prior year, whereas sales for all mobile phones only increased by 31.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stan Schroeder |url=http://mashable.com/2011/02/10/symbian-number-one-gartner-report/ |title=Gartner: Symbian Is Still the Number One Smartphone Platform |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2011-02-10 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1543014 |title=Gartner Says Worldwide Mobile Device Sales to End Users Reached 1.6 Billion Units in 2010; Smartphone Sales Grew 72 Percent in 2010 |publisher=Gartner.com |date=2011-02-11 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an Olswang report in early 2011, the rate of smartphone adoption is accelerating: as of March 2011 22% of UK consumers had a smartphone, with this percentage rising to 31% amongst 24- to 35-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/03/17/mobile-tv-convergence/ |title=Olswang Predicts Mobileâs Impact on TV: The Convergent Revolution |publisher=Tvgenius.net |date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Berg Insight reported data that showed global smartphone shipments increased 74% from 2009 to 2010.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news |title=Berg: Smartphone shipments grew 74% in 2010 |work=Boy Genius Report |date=March 10, 2011 |url=http://www.bgr.com/2011/03/10/berg-smartphone-shipments-grew-74-in-2010/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of mobile users in the United States by Nielsen in Q3, 2011 reports that smartphone ownership has reached 43% of all U.S. mobile subscribers, with the vast majority of users under the age of 44 owning one. In the 25-34 age range smartphone ownership is reported to be at 62%.&lt;ref name=&quot;GenerationApp&quot;&gt;[http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/?p=29786 Generation App: 62% of Mobile Users 25-34 own Smartphones | Nielsen Wire]&lt;/ref&gt; NPD Group reports that the share of handset sales that were smartphones in Q3, 2011 reached 59% for consumers 18 and over in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPD2011Q3&quot;&gt;[http://www.npdgroup.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111114a Market Research | Consumer Market Research - NPD - As Smartphone Prices Fall, Retailers Are Leaving Money on the Table, According to The NPD Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

In profit share worldwide smartphones now far exceed the share of non-smartphones. According to a November 2011 research note from Canaccord Genuity, Apple Inc., which doesn't make phones that aren't smartphones, holds 52% of the total mobile industry's operating profits, while only holding 4.2% of the global handset market. HTC and RIM similarly only make smartphones and their wordwide profit shares are at 9% and 7%, respectively. Samsung, in second place after Apple at 29%, makes both smartphones and feature phones and doesn't report a breakdown separating their profits between the two kinds of devices, but it can be intuited that a significant portion of that profit comes from their flagship smartphone devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395951,00.asp#fbid=SLgcdJun7IU Apple, With 4 Percent of Handset Market, Captures 52 Percent of Profits]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating system market shares===

{{main|Mobile operating system}}
2010 saw the rapid rise of the Google Android operating system from 4 percent of new deployments in 2009 to 33 percent at the beginning of 2011 making it share the top position with the since long dominating [[Symbian OS]].  The smaller rivals include US popular [[Blackberry OS]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], Samsung's recently introduced [[Bada (operating system)|bada]], HP's heir of [[Palm]] [[webOS]] and the Microsoft [[Windows Phone]] OS seeing a possible revival through an alliance with [[Nokia]].

Over late 2009 and 2010 Android's smartphone operating system market share increased very rapidly.&lt;ref name=Gartner_Q3_2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilephonedevelopment.com/archives/1149 |title=Mobile Phone Development &amp;raquo; Blog Archive &amp;raquo; Gartner Q3 2010 |publisher=Mobilephonedevelopment.com |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth quarter of 2010, Android surpassed Symbian as the most common operating system in smartphones, with 32.9 million units sold versus 31.0 million. Android-equipped phones sold seven times more than in the prior year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tarmo Virki |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/mobile-technology/google-topples-symbian-from-smartphones-top-spot/article1888557/?cmpid=rss1 |title=Google topples Symbian from smart phones top spot |publisher=Theglobeandmail.com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Canalys]], Google's Android operating system, which is offered to phone makers for free, has raced to the top past operating systems by Nokia, Apple, RIM, and Microsoft. In Q1 2011 Google's Android market share was 35 percent, increasing significantly from 10 percent the previous year, while Nokia's Symbian dropped to 26 percent from 46 percent over the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/04/us-smartphones-research-idUSTRE7434VV20110504 |title=Android became clear smartphone leader in first quarter: Canalys |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, which currently has one of the highest penetrations of smartphones in the World, Android achieved 50% market share in October 2011&lt;ref name=How Android conquered the UK Smartphone market&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestsmartphone.com/2011/11/02/android-takes-over-in-uk/ |title=Android Takes Over in UK |publisher=bestsmartphone.com |date=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Enterprise share by operating system ====

In a worldwide study of 2,300 workers at 1,100 businesses by [[iPass]] it was reported that Apple's iPhones have displaced RIM's BlackBerry devices in enterprise adoption in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mobile-workforce-project.ipass.com/ iPass : Mobile Workforce Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The share for iPhones increased to 45% from 31.1% in 2010, while the Blackberry share dropped to 32.2% from 34.5% in the previous year. Android phones also increased in share, to 21.3% from 11.3% in 2010, exceeding Symbian for the first time, which dropped to 7.4% from 12.4%. Windows Mobile and all other smartphone OSes also dropped in 2011 compared to 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/11/16/iphone_pushes_past_blackberry_to_top_enterprise_phone_ranks.html iPhone pushes past BlackBerry to top enterprise phone ranks]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Customer loyalty by operating system====

According to a survey of more than 6,000 smartphone users through 2010 by mobile analytics firm Zokem, the top five loyalty scores for smartphone platforms are the iPhone at 73%, followed by Google's Android at 40%, Samsung's Bada at 33%, RIM's BlackBerry at 30%, and Symbian S60 at 23%. Windows Mobile and Palm follow at 10% each. Customer loyalty gauges the likelihood that the user of a smartphone platform whose contract has expired or who has broken or lost their phone will repurchase another one that uses that same platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zokem.com/2011/01/in-the-us-market-iphone-outperforms-other-mobile-platforms-in-user-loyalty-by-a-wide-margin-android-is-second-blackberry-fourth/ In the US Market, iPhone Outperforms Other Mobile Platforms in User Loyalty by a Wide Margin, Android is Second, Blackberry Fourth]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/iPhone-Whips-Android-Blackberry-in-User-Loyalty-Zokem-445681/ iPhone Whips Android, BlackBerry in User Loyalty: Zokem]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturer market shares===

From the launch of their Communicator model in 1996 until 2011 [[Nokia]] was dominant in the smartphone market,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/mobile-technology/nokia-slips-from-1-to-3-in-smart-phone-sales/article2114001/ |title=Nokia slips from 1 to 3 in smart phone sales |date=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of Q2 2011 [[Apple, Inc.]] has become the worldwide number one single manufacturer of smartphones by revenue, profit, and volume, followed by [[Samsung]], with Nokia now in third place and the remaining 48.9% of vendor market share split amongst all other manufacturers.&lt;ref name=SA_Agrees&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgr.com/2011/07/29/sa-agrees-apple-now-top-smartphone-vendor-in-the-world-with-240-growth/|title=SA agrees: Apple now top smartphone vendor in the world with 140% growth|publisher=BGR|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a report by Strategy Analytics, Samsung overtook Apple in smartphone shipments with an estimated 27.8 million units shipped in Q3 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;MarketwatchQ3&quot;&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/strategy-analytics-samsung-becomes-worlds-number-one-smartphone-vendor-in-q3-2011-2011-10-27 Strategy Analytics: Samsung Becomes World's Number One Smartphone Vendor in Q3 2011 - MarketWatch]&lt;/ref&gt; (Samsung does not publicly disclose the numbers of their smartphone shipments and sales).

Market share among smartphone manufacturers does not resemble smartphone OS market share numbers due to the differences between the two major smartphone OS sales models: single manufacturer and licensed. Apple's [[iPhone]], Nokia's [[Symbian]], and RIM's [[BlackBerry]] smartphones are currently only available from single manufacturers. [[Google|Google's]] [[Android operating system|Android]] OS and [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] mobile OSes are platforms that are licensed and used by a variety of manufacturers. As a result, manufacturers of smartphones using licensed OSes all split the total market share of that OS between them, while the total share for a single-manufacturer OS is held by that manufacturer alone.

Note that Nokia's Symbian OS was previously available from several manufacturers under a licensed model, then later predominantly only by Nokia itself more like a single manufacturer model.

Samsung smartphones use a diverse portfolio of operating systems, including their own [[Bada]] operating system along with Android and [[Windows Mobile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/27/smartphone-sales-will-hit-420-million-in-2011-to-take-28-percent-of-the-total-phone-market/|title=Smartphone Sales Will Hit 420 Million In 2011, To Take 28 Percent Of The Total Phone Market|publisher=TechCrunch|date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple surpassed Nokia worldwide by revenue and profit for the first time in Q2 2011, with Apple's profit share of the total worldwide smartphone market increasing to 66.3% while Nokia reported a loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgr.com/2011/07/29/apples-iphone-accounted-for-66-of-q2-smartphone-profit-among-top-vendors/ Apple's iPhone accounted for 66% of Q2 smartphone profit among top vendors]&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's iPhone sales also overtook Nokia's Symbian smartphone volume shipments by 20.3 million and 16.7 million respectively, although Nokia had already announced plans to phase Symbian out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Ward |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4d7fd1e2-b38e-11e0-b56c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1SesDPO9Z |title=Apple overtakes Nokia in smartphone volumes |publisher=FT.com |date=2011-07-21}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between Q2 2010 and Q2 2011 Nokia's worldwide Symbian smartphone sales dropped significantly from 38.1 percent to 15.2 percent, while [[Samsung]] smartphone sales increased significantly worldwide from 5.0 percent to 17.5 percent.&lt;ref name=SA_Agrees/&gt;

Nokia still remains the number one company in the worldwide mobile phone market with sales for Q2 2011 of 88.5 million when including feature phone platforms such as S40, compared with 16.7 million smartphones running Symbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2011/07/21/nokia-reports-q2-results-sells-88-5-million-devices-and-declares-net-loss-of-368-million-euros/ |title=Nokia reports Q2 results: Sells 88.5 million devices and declares net loss of 368 million euros |publisher=Mobilesyrup.com |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Not sure this is necessary in an article focusing on smartphones --&gt;

According to [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] in July 2011, in the United States Apple is the top smartphone manufacturer at 28% of the market, with RIM at 20%. Google Android has 39% of the U.S. market as a whole, but this is split between HTC at 14%, Motorola at 11%, Samsung at 8%, and other remaining manufacturers at 6%. HTC's total share of the U.S. smartphone market actually ties RIM at 20%, since sales of their smartphones running Microsoft's mobile operating systems account for 6% of the total market. Samsung similarly gains 2% of overall U.S. market share due to their sales of Microsoft OS-based smartphones. In contrast to the worldwide market, Nokia's share of U.S. smartphone sales is very small, at only 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/?p=28516|title=In U.S. Smartphone Market, Android is Top Operating System, Apple is Top Manufacturer|publisher=Nielsen|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=05 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/07/android-ios-platform-share/all/1|title=Android Still Dominates Phones, But What About the Rest of Mobile?|publisher=Wired|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=05 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen's Q3, 2011 survey of mobile users maintains Apple as the top U.S. smartphone maker with a continued 28% of the market, with RIM dropping from 20% to 18%.&lt;ref name=&quot;GenerationApp&quot;/&gt; While Google Android increased in total operating system share from 39% to 43% of the U.S. market, it remains fragmented amongst many different manufacturers. Over the same quarter Microsoft managed a modest gain from 6% to 7% total U.S. smartphone OS share.

Checks with U.S. carriers by technology analyst firm Canaccord Genuity in April and August 2011 have found that Apple's iPhone 4 has consistently been the top selling device at AT&amp;T and Verizon. In addition, the second most popular spot at AT&amp;T has been maintained by the iPhone 3GS, which was originally released in 2009 (and has never been sold on Verizon). In August 2011 the most popular smartphones on Sprint and T-Mobile in the U.S. were the HTC EVO 3D 4G and HTC Sensation, respectively. The other second most popular smartphones were the Samsung Charge 4G on Verizon, the Motorola Photon 4G on Sprint, and the HTC myTouch 4G Slide on T-Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/06/iphone_4_remains_top_selling_us_smartphone_despite_growing_iphone_5_hype.html iPhone 4 remains top-selling US smartphone despite growing iPhone 5 hype]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/05/09/previous_gen_apple_ipad_iphone_3gs_often_outsell_new_android_devices.html Previous-gen Apple iPad, iPhone 3GS often outsell new Android devices]&lt;/ref&gt; NPD Group reported that in Q3, 2011 the overall top 5 smartphones by sales across all carriers in the U.S. were, in order: the iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, HTC EVO 4G, Motorola Droid 3, and Samsung Intensity II.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPD2011Q3&quot;/&gt;

Currently the vast majority of smartphones are manufactured in China, Taiwan and Mexico, for companies based in the U.S. (Apple, [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], Motorola), South Korea ([[LG]], Samsung), Canada (RIM), Finland (Nokia), Taiwan (HTC) and the U.K. ([[Sony Ericsson]]).

==Open-source development==
The [[open source|open-source]] culture has penetrated the smartphone market in several ways. There have been attempts to open source both hardware and software of smartphones.

In February 2010 Nokia made [[Symbian]] open source. Thus, most commercial smartphones were based on open-source operating systems. These include those based on [[Linux]], such as Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]], Nokia's [[Maemo]], Hewlett-Packard's [[WebOS]], and those based on [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], such as the [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]]-based Apple [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]]. [[Maemo]] was later merged with Intel's project [[Moblin]] to form [[MeeGo]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Menezes |first=Gary |url=http://www.watblog.com/2010/02/06/symbian-os-now-fully-open-source |title=Symbian OS, Now Fully Open Source |publisher=Watblog.com |date=2010-09-11 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wontek.com/smart-phones/nokia/nokia-n9-smart-phone-review |title=Nokia N9 Smart Phone Review |publisher=Wontek.com |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
