'''Dale Chihuly''' (born September 20, 1941, in [[Tacoma, Washington]], United States) is an American [[Glass art|glass sculptor]] and entrepreneur.

==Biography==
[[File:Dale Chihuly Persian Ceiling deYoung Museum 2008.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''Persian Ceiling'' installation by Dale Chihuly at the [[M. H. de Young Memorial Museum|De Young Museum]] in San Francisco, 2008.]]
Chihuly graduated from [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Tacoma, Washington)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in Tacoma, Washington. He enrolled at the [[University of Puget Sound|College of the Puget Sound]] in 1959. A year later, he transferred to the [[University of Washington]] at Seattle, where in 1965 he received a bachelor of arts degree in [[interior design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spi&quot;&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/visualart/266953_dalechihuly17.html Chihuly victimized by his own success?], an April 17, 2006 article from the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, he received a Master of Science in sculpture from the [[University of WisconsinâMadison]],&lt;ref name=&quot;spi&quot;/&gt; where he studied under [[Harvey Littleton]]. In 1968, he studied glass in Venice on a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] and received a [[Master of Fine Arts]] at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].&lt;ref name=&quot;spi&quot;/&gt; In 1971, with the support of John Hauberg and Anne Gould Hauberg, Chihuly founded the [[Pilchuck Glass School]] near [[Stanwood, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilchuck.com/about/about_main.htm About the Pilchuck Glass School] from their website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, while Chihuly was in England, he was involved in a head-on car accident during which he flew through the windshield.&lt;ref name=&quot;spi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;strange&quot;&gt;[http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=30734 Glass Houses: Dale Chihuly Files a Lawsuit That Raises Big Questions... About Dale Chihuly], a February 2006 article from ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  His face was severely cut by glass and he was blinded in his left eye. After recovering, he continued to blow glass until he dislocated his left shoulder in a 1979 [[bodysurfing]] accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;strange&quot;/&gt; No longer able to hold the glass blowing pipe, he hired others to do the work; Chihuly explained the change in a 2006 interview, saying &quot;Once I stepped back, I liked the view&quot; and pointing out that it allowed him to see the work from more perspectives and enabled him to anticipate problems faster.&lt;ref name=&quot;spi&quot;/&gt; Chihuly describes his role as &quot;more choreographer than dancer, more supervisor than participant, more director than actor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;spi&quot;/&gt; ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' reporter Erin Glass wrote that she &quot;wonders at the vision of not just the artist Chihuly, but the wildly successful entrepreneur Chihuly whose estimated sales by 2004 was reported by ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' as $29 million.&quot;&lt;ref name=Glass&gt;{{Citation |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |title= âChihulyâ a site-specific explosion of art at Salk |last= Glass |first= Erin |date= 22 April 2010 |url = http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/apr/22/chihuly-a-site-specific-explosion-of-art-at-salk/ |accessdate= 2010-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chihuly and his team of artists were the subjects of the [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''Chihuly Over Venice''. They were also featured in the documentary ''Chihuly in the Hotshop,'' syndicated to public television stations by [[American Public Television]] starting on November 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandpress.net/hotshop.html ''Chihuly Over Venice''] from Chihuly's Portland Press website&lt;/ref&gt;

==About his work==

Regina Hackett, as the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' art critic, provided a chronology of his work during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s:&lt;ref name=&quot;spi&quot;/&gt;

*1975: Navajo Blanket Series, in which patterns of [[Navajo rug|Navajo blankets]] were painted onto glass
*1977: Northwest Coast Basket Series, baskets inspired by Northwest coast Indian baskets he'd seen as a child
*1980: Seaform Series, transparent sculptures of thin glass, strengthened by ribbed strands of color
*1981: Macchia Series, featuring every color available in the studio
*1986: Persian Series, inspired by Middle East glass from the 12th- to 14th-century, featuring more restrained color and room-sized installations
*1988: Venetian Series, improvisations based on Italian [[Art Deco]]
*1989: Ikebana Series, glass flower arrangements inspired by [[Ikebana]]
*1990: Venetian Series returns, this time in a more eccentric form
*1991: Niijima Floats, six-foot spheres of intricate color inspired by Japanese [[glass fishing float]]s from the island of [[Niijima]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chihuly.com/installations/niijima Niijima&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Chihuly.com] from Chihuly's website&lt;/ref&gt;
*1992: [[Chandelier]]s, starting modestly but by the middle of the decade involving a ton of glass orbs and shapes that in some works look like flowers, others like breasts, and still others like snakes

Chihuly has also produced a sizable volume of &quot;Irish cylinders&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lakeview-museum.org/photos/Cylinder.jpg photo] from lakeview-museum.org&lt;/ref&gt; which are more modest in conception than his blown glass works.

For his exhibition in Jerusalem in 2000, in addition to the glass pieces, he had enormous blocks of transparent ice brought in from an Alaskan [[Artesian aquifer|artesian well]] and formed a wall, echoing the stones of the nearby [[Tower of David|Citadel]]. Lights with [[color gel]]s were set up behind them for illumination. Chihuly said the melting wall represented the &quot;dissolution of barriers&quot; between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Cooling a hotbed of unrest in Mideast? | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/721087/Cooling-a-hotbed-of-unrest-in-Mideast.html| publisher=[[Deseret News]]| author=Cohen, Jay | date=October 4, 1999| accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galleries==
Chihuly's largest permanent exhibit can be found at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art.
Chihuly maintains two retail stores in partnership with [[MGM Resorts International]]. One is located at the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellagio.com/shopping/via-fiore.aspx List of stores] from the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]] hotel/casino website&lt;/ref&gt; the other at the [[MGM Grand Macau|MGM Grand Casino]] in [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trimaran.com.hk/files/MGM_Grand%20Opening_Press%20Release%20(Eng-final).pdf Press release by MGM Macau] mentioning Chihuly shop (search for &quot;Chihuly retail&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other galleries also carry his pieces.In 1983 Chihuly returned to his native Pacific Northwest where he continued to develop his own work at the Pilchuck Glass School, which he had helped to found in 1971. Throughout the 1970s, influenced by the great glassblowing tradition of Murano, Chihuly experimented with the team approach to glassblowing. Working with a team of master glassblowers and assistants has enabled him to produce architectural glass art of a scale and quantity unimaginable working alone or with only one assistant.

In 2010 the [[Space Needle]] Corporation submitted a proposal for an exhibition of Chihuly's work at a site in the [[Seattle Center]], in competition with proposals for other uses from several other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2011299316_glasshouse09m.html |title=  Chihuly glass museum proposed at Seattle Center where Fun Forest stood |first= Emily |last= Heffter |date = 10 June 2010 | newspaper= [[Seattle Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2012083798_chihuly11m.html |title=In a second attempt to sell the city and the public on a Dale Chihuly glass exhibit at Seattle Center |first= Emily |last= Heffter |date = 10 June 2010 | newspaper= [[Seattle Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which will see the new Chihuly exhibition hall occupy the site of the former Fun Forest amusement park in the Seattle Center park and entertainment complex, received the final green light from the Seattle City Council on April 25, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37553/divisive-dale-chihuly-glass-art-museum-approved-for-former-seattle-amusement-park/ Divisive Dale Chihuly Glass-Art &quot;Museum&quot; Approved for Former Seattle Amusement Park] ARTINFO.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 lawsuit==
In 2006, Chihuly filed a lawsuit against his former longtime employee, glassblower Bryan Rubino, and businessman Robert Kaindl, under accusations of copyright and trademark infringement. Kaindl's pieces used titles Chihuly used for his own works, such as Seaforms and Ikebana, and resembled the construction of Chihuly's pieces. Arguments made by legal experts stated influence on art style is not copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/11/Floridian/Glass_warfare.shtml Glass warfare&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from the website of the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002686721_chihuly16m.html The Seattle Times: Local News: Glass artist Chihuly's lawsuit tests limits of copyrighting art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], a 2005 article from ''The Seattle Times'';&lt;/ref&gt;

Chihuly settled the lawsuit independently with Rubino initially,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Artists Chihuly, Rubino settle claims; suit against entrepreneur unresolved | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003199340_chihuly15m.html| publisher=The Seattle Times| author=Sheila Farr and Susan Kelleher | date=August 15, 2006| accessdate=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later Kaindl as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003484492_chihuly19m.html Chihuly, rival glass artist settle dispute&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] a 2006 article from ''The Seattle Times&lt;/ref&gt;
