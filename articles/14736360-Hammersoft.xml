The [[discography]] of [[The Stooges]], a [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Michigan]] based [[Rock music|rock]] band founded by &quot;[[Honorific nicknames in popular music#Male titles|The Godfather of Punk Music]]&quot; [[Iggy Pop]] as singer, [[Ron Asheton]] as guitarist, [[Dave Alexander (The Stooges)|Dave Alexander]] as bass-guitarist and [[Scott Asheton]] as drummer, currently consists of four [[studio album]]s, twenty-four [[Single (music)|singles]], four [[live album]]s, and three [[box set]]s.

The Stooges debut album ''[[The Stooges (album)|The Stooges]]'' was released on August 5, 1969 in the [[United States]] and one month later in the [[United Kingdom]]. The album wasn't a huge commercial success &amp;mdash; it did chart in the [[Billboard 200|Billboard 200 charts]] on 106. One year later, on August 1970, the band released the album ''[[Fun House (The Stooges album)|Fun House]]'', which didn't chart either in the Billboard 200, or in the [[UK Album Chart]] and any other international music album chart. In 1973 the Stooges released the album ''[[Raw Power]]''. It charted in the Billboard 200 at 182, in the [[United Kingdom]] at least at 44 and is the best charted The Stooges album in the United Kingdom to date. After the release of their third album the Stooges announced the break-up of the band, who were also known at the time as Iggy Pop &amp; The Stooges. The Stooges reunited thirty-four years after their official dissolution and released ''[[The Weirdness]]''. Although the album was the best-charted album in the United States by peaking at number 130, its overall commercial charting is similar to that of the Stooges' first three albums.

Despite being a commercial failure (none of their albums has received a certification), the Stooges are described by critics as one of the key bands of [[Punk rock|Punk music]] and their genre is described as &quot;[[Proto-Punk]]&quot;, an early form of punk rock. Many musicians, especially punk music bands, as well as artists like [[Kurt Cobain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Cobain, Kurt 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Cobain, Kurt|title = Journals| publisher = Riverhead Hardcover|year = 2002|isbn = 978-1573222327}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited the Stooges as a huge influence.
