'''Ubuntu Software Center''' (originally codenamed ''AppCenter'') is a [[computer program]] for browsing, installing and removing software on the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu operating system]]. Based upon the [[GNOME]] application, gnome-app-install, which is similar in function and appearance, it serves as a [[GTK+]] [[graphical user interface]] front-end to the [[Advanced Packaging Tool]], part of the [[Debian]] package management system. Ubuntu Software Center can also be used to add [[Software repository|repositories]]. It is written in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoronix27Aug09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=ubuntu_software_store&amp;num=1|title = Canonical Unveils The Ubuntu Software Store|accessdate = 2009-08-15|last = Larabel|first = Michael|year = 2009|month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Launchpad436648&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

==Development history==
In early 2009 Ubuntu developers noted that package management within Ubuntu could be improved and consolidated. Recent releases of Ubuntu, such as [[List_of_Ubuntu_releases#Ubuntu_9.04_.28Jaunty_Jackalope.29|Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope)]] included five applications for package management which consume space and other resources as well as provide confusion to users. Applications can be downloaded using the basic ''Add/Remove Applications'' or with the [[Synaptic Package Manager]]. The [[Update Manager]] provides updating for installed packages and ''Computer Janitor'' cleans up packages that are no longer needed. The ''Software Sources'' application allows user selection of the package download location.&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter|title = SoftwareCenter|accessdate = 31 May 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ubuntu developers set as a goal:

{{quotation|&quot;...there should be one obvious mechanism for installing, removing, and updating software in Ubuntu, with a self-evident name and an interface anyone can use. There should be a coordinated system for developers and enthusiasts to improve the usefulness of descriptions and other metadata for software packages. The software updates interface should be honed to maximize the voluntary installation of updates across the millions of computers on which Ubuntu is installed. And projects and vendors whose software is packaged for Ubuntu should be encouraged to provide links to their softwareâs presence in the Software Store, instead of command-line installation instructions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWiki&quot; |quotation/&gt; }}

Canonical introduced the Software Center gradually starting with [[List_of_Ubuntu_releases#Ubuntu_9.10_.28Karmic_Koala.29|Ubuntu 9.10 (''Karmic Koala'')]] with complete functionality expected by Ubuntu 11.10, in October 2011. As of May 2011, the plan has mostly been completed:&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWiki&quot; /&gt;

;October 2009 - version 1.0.2 shipped with [[Ubuntu 9.10]] (''Karmic Koala'')
:Introduced a new simple interface for locating, installing, and removing software, with better security based on [[PolicyKit]] instead of [[gksudo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWiki&quot; /&gt;
;April 2010 - version 2.0.2 shipped with [[Ubuntu 10.04]] (''Lucid Lynx'') LTS
:The Software Center added lists of non-application packages in a simplified manner and also provide subcategories for applications and [[Personal Package Archive]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWiki&quot; /&gt;
;October 2010 - version 3.0.4 shipped with [[Ubuntu 10.10]] (''Maverick Meerkat'')

;October 2011 - [[Ubuntu 11.10]] (''Oneiric Ocelot'')
:This version is expected to allow donations for non-commercial software projects.&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWiki&quot; /&gt; Design improvements planned for this version include faster start-up times, larger icons, Unity Launcher integration, sorting by ratings and system requirements for applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/05/ubuntu-software-centre-changes-for-oneiric/Ubuntu Software centre changes planned for Oneiric]
By Joey Sneddon, Published May 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;Some [[GDebi]] technology was also integrated to improve speed when handling [[.deb]] files.&lt;ref&gt;{https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneiricOcelot/TechnicalOverview Technical Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release history==
The application was initially known as ''Ubuntu Software Store''.  The initial version (0.1) was released on 21 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Ubuntu Software Center Changelog&lt;/ref&gt;  The package was renamed the ''Ubuntu Software Center'' in version 0.4.0 on 25 September 2009 following a discussion with Ubuntu community members. In most English-speaking countries outside the USA it is known as the ''Ubuntu Software Centre''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Launchpad436648&quot; /&gt;
