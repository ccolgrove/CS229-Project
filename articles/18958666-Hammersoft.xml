He is known both for his role as Dr. Eddie &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald in the British TV series ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'' and as [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'']] films.

==Early life==
Coltrane was born Anthony Robert McMillan in [[Rutherglen]], [[South Lanarkshire]], the son of Jean McMillan Ross (nÃ©e Howie), a teacher and pianist, and Ian Baxter McMillan, a [[general practitioner]] who also served as a [[forensic]] police surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/73/Robbie-Coltrane.html |title=Robbie Coltrane Biography (1950-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4569860.stm | work=BBC News | title=Robbie Coltrane's magical career | date=31 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800020819/bio |title=Robbie Coltrane Biography - Yahoo! Movies |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has an older sister, Annie, and a late younger sister, Jane. Coltrane is the great-grandson of Scottish businessman [[Thomas W. Howie]]. He was educated at the prestigious [[Glenalmond College]] in [[Perthshire]], from which he was nearly expelled after hanging the prefects' gowns from the school clocktower. Though he later described his experiences there as deeply unhappy, he played for the rugby First XV, was head of the school's debating society and won prizes for his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/robbie_coltrane_biog.html |title=Robbie Coltrane biography |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Glenalmond, Coltrane went on to [[Glasgow School of Art]], where he was ridiculed for &quot;having an accent like Prince Charles&quot; (which he quickly disposed of, though not before gaining the nickname &quot;[[Little Lord Fauntleroy|Lord Fauntleroy]]&quot;) and then the [[Moray House College Of Education]] in [[Edinburgh]]. Coltrane later called for [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] to be banned and used to be known as &quot;Red Robbie&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/03/20/bacol20.xml|title='Hagrid?

==Career==
[[File:Robbie Coltrane.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Coltrane in the 1980s]]
Coltrane moved into acting in his early twenties, taking the stage name Coltrane (in tribute to jazz saxophonist [[John Coltrane]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/opinion.cfm?id=641752004 |title=Scotland on Sunday |publisher=Scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and working in theatre and [[stand-up comedy]]. Appearing in the 1981 [[BBC]] television comedy series ''[[A Kick Up the Eighties]]'', his comic skills also brought him roles in the ''[[The Comic Strip Presents]]'' (1982) series and the comedy sketch shows ''[[Alfresco (TV series)|Alfresco]]'' (1983â1984) and ''[[Laugh??? I Nearly Paid My Licence Fee]]'' (1984).

Coltrane soon moved into films, obtaining roles in a number of movies such as ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]]'' (1980), ''[[Death Watch]]'' (1980), ''[[Scrubbers]]'' (1983), ''[[Krull (film)|Krull]]'' (1983), ''[[The Supergrass]]'' (1985), ''[[Absolute Beginners (film)|Absolute Beginners]]'' (1986), ''[[Mona Lisa (film)|Mona Lisa]]'' (1986) and appeared as &quot;Annabelle&quot; in ''[[The Fruit Machine (film)|The Fruit Machine]]'' (1988). On television, he also appeared in ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', [[Tutti Frutti (1987 TV series)|''Tutti Frutti'']] (1987), as [[Samuel Johnson]] in ''[[Blackadder]]'' (1987) (a role he later reprised in the more serious ''[[Boswell and Johnson's Tour of the Western Islands]]'' (1993)), and in a number of stand-up and sketch comedy shows. He played the part of [[Falstaff]] in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s ''[[Henry V (1989 film)|Henry V]]'' (1989) He co-starred with [[Eric Idle]] in ''[[Nuns on the Run]]'' (1990), and played the [[Pope]] in ''[[The Pope Must Die]]'' (1991). He also played a would-be private detective obsessed with [[Humphrey Bogart]] in the TV play ''[[The Bogie Man]]''. 

His roles went from strength to strength in the 1990s with the TV series ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'' (1993â1996, returning in 2006 for a one-off special; in which he starred as forensic psychologist Dr. Edward &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crackertv.co.uk/edwardfitzgerald.htm |title=Dr Edward &quot;Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald |publisher=Crackertv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] award as the stepping stone to parts in bigger films, such as the [[James Bond]] films ''[[GoldenEye]]'' (1995) and ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (1999), a major supporting role in ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001), as well as half-giant [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the [[Harry Potter (films)|''Harry Potter'' films]] (2001â2011). [[J.K. Rowling]], author of the [[Harry Potter series]], had Coltrane at the top of her list to play Hagrid and when asked who she would like to see in the role responded âRobbie Coltrane for Hagridâ in one quick breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/tag/jk-rowling/ |title=j.k. rowling |publisher=Neatorama |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1111-telegraph-alderson.html |title=&quot;'They really do look as I'd imagined they would inside my head.'&quot; Telegraph.co.uk 11 November 2001. (Accio Quote!, the Largest Archive of J.K. Rowling quotes on the web) |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coltrane has also presented a number of popular documentary programmes for the British [[ITV]] network based around his twin passions for travel and transportation. ''[[Coltrane in a Cadillac]]'' (1993) saw him cross North America from Los Angeles to 
New York behind the wheel of a 1951 [[Cadillac Series 62]] coupe convertible, a journey of {{convert|3765|mi}} which he completed in 32 days.
  
In 1997, Coltrane appeared in a series of six programmes under the title ''Coltrane's Planes and Automobiles'' in which he extolled the virtues of a number of engineering achievements, namely the [[steam engine]], the [[diesel engine]], the [[supercharger]], the [[V8]] engine, the [[two-stroke]] engine, and the [[jet engine]]. In these programmes he showed he was not afraid to get his hands dirty, getting involved with dismantling and rebuilding several engines. He also single-handledly removed the engine from a [[Trabant]] car in 23 minutes.

In August 2007, Coltrane presented a series for [[ITV]] called ''B-Road Britain'' in which he travelled from [[London]] to [[Glasgow]], stopping in towns and villages along the way.

Coltrane was voted No. 10 in [[ITV]]'s &quot;TV's 50 Greatest Stars&quot; and sixth in a poll of 2000 adults across the UK to find the 'most famous Scot', behind the [[Loch Ness Monster]], [[Robert Burns]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Robert the Bruce]] and [[William Wallace]].
