The university is located in [[Richland Township, Cambria County, Pennsylvania|Richland Township]], a suburban area of [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]], [[Pennsylvania]] and was founded in 1927 as one of the first regional campuses of a major [[university]] in the [[United States]].

==History==
UPJ was founded in 1927 as a two-year college of the University of Pittsburgh. For almost 20 years it held classes in the Johnstown High School building in the Kernville section of downtown Johnstown. After World War II, the Johnstown College moved to the Moxham section of town where the number of courses and students increased. In the early 1960s, community leaders worked with the University of Pittsburgh to build a new campus in [[Richland Township, Cambria County, Pennsylvania|Richland Township]], a Johnstown suburb. The new campus opened in 1967 with two classroom buildings, five dormitories, and a student union. Degree-granting status was awarded to UPJ by the University of Pittsburgh in 1970. The campus has grown significantly since that time, with five academic buildings, a library, an expanded student union, a sports and aquatic center, a conference center, a chapel, a performing arts center, and a large cluster of dormitories, lodges, townhouse apartments and other student residence housing. UPJ now offers over 40 baccalaureate and associate degree programs.

==Academics==

UPJ offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science degree in more than 40 areas. Additionally, UPJ offers several associate degrees in the allied health area. 
The college offers more than 40 academic majors, with minors available in most of the major fields, as well as in other areas of arts and sciences. The average class size is 25â30, and the student to teacher ratio is 19:1. The college is strictly undergraduate, and all courses are taught by college faculty. The 149 faculty members have outstanding credentials and remain active professionally.  Special opportunities include internships, the Presidentâs Scholars program, independent and directed studies, a self-designed major, the Freshman Seminar Series, an International Studies Certificate, and the Academic Success Center.

UPJ operates on a modified trimester calendar. The standard school year includes a 15-week fall term (September to mid-December) and a 15-week spring term (January to mid-April). Optional summer term offerings from 5-week to 15-week sessions allow students to accelerate their degrees. 

The University of Pittsburgh, including UPJ and other regional campuses, is accredited by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] and by the [[Middle_States_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools#Commission_on_Higher_Education|Commission on Higher Education]]. The engineering technology programs at Johnstown are accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology Inc.
