[[General]] '''Muhammad Yusaf Khan [[Qaimkhani]]''' (born February 10, 1948),  is a retired [[four-star general]] of the [[Pakistan Army]] who served as the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Vice Chief of Army Staff (VCOAS)]] from October 8, 2001 until October 7, 2004. When his 3-year term expired in October 2004, he was replaced by General [[Ahsan Saleem Hyat]].

==Military career==
General Yusaf Khan is a graduate of [[Military College Jhelum]] (College No. 2642) and was commissioned in the [[Pakistan Army]] in 1966 in the 37th PMA Long Course&lt;ref&gt;Ikram Sehgal. [http://www.mediamonitors.net/ikramsehgal42.html &quot;Choosing Merit over Friendship&quot;] ''The News'', 9 October 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the Guides Cavalry. He served various command and staff posts including Commanding Officer Guides Cavalry, Commanding Officer of a Tank Battalion in [[Saudi Arabia]], Instructor at [[Command and Staff College]], Chief of Staff of a Strike Corps, Commander of an armoured division, [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]], and finally the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Vice Chief of Army Staff]] of the Pakistan Army. 

Yusaf Khan was promoted to Lieutenant General in June 1998 and sent as the Military Secretary (MS) in the GHQ. Later on 29 October 1998, he was transferred as Commander [[II Corps (Pakistan)|II Corps]], Multan.

===Military coup of 1999 and Chief of General Staff===
During the time of [[1999 Pakistani coup d'Ã©tat|military coup of 1999]], the then Lieutenant General Muhammad Yusaf Khan was the Corps Commander Multan. Due to his close proximity to General [[Musharraf]], by September 2000, he was posted as Chief of General Staff (CGS) to replace the then Lieutenant General [[Aziz Khan (general)|Aziz Khan]] who was instead given the command of Lahore Corps. The post of [[Chief of General Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of General Staff]] is considered vital as the chief overlooks the two intelligence bureaus within Pakistan Army ([[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|Military Intelligence]] and Intelligence Bureau). In fact, it is believed that a military coup against a government cannot be launched without tacit approval of the Chief of General Staff.

===Vice Chief of Army Staff===
In October 2001, General Yusaf was promoted to four-star general and replaced Lieutenant General [[Muzaffar Usmani]] as the [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Vice Chief of Army Staff]]. He was junior only to Usmani, hence superseding one officer while ascending to the four-star post of VCOAS. It is interesting to note that the timing of promotion of General Yusaf and General [[Aziz Khan (general)|Aziz Khan]] coincided with the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|US invasion of Afghanistan]], when these generals superseded Lieutenant General [[Muzaffar Usmani]] and Lieutenant General [[Mahmud Ahmed]], both of whom were known for their hawkish stances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2001/10/08/top10.htm 'New Vice Chief and CJCSC']&lt;/ref&gt;

General Yusaf also stayed the ceremonial post of Colonel-in-Chief of the Armoured Corps of Pakistan Army. The four-star general is usually promoted as the Colonel-in-Chief of his respective unit. He was promoted to that position by President General [[Pervez Musharraf]] on 31 March 2003 at the Armoured Corps Regimental Center in [[Nowshera Cantonment|Nowshera]] and continued till 3 May 2005 when he was replaced by General [[Ahsan Saleem Hyat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidentofpakistan.gov.pk/PRPressReleaseDetail.aspx?nPRPressReleaseId=583&amp;nYear=2008&amp;nMonth=2 &quot;General Yusaf installed new Colonel in Chief of Armoured Corps&quot;] ''President of Pakistan Press Release'', 31 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
