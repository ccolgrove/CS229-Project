The '''2014 FIFA World Cup''' will be the 20th [[FIFA World Cup]], an international [[association football]] tournament that will take place in [[Brazil]] from 12 June to 13 July 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminarydraw/news/newsid=1480389/index.html |title= Pot allocations for the Preliminary Draw |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-07-28 |publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This will be the second time the country has hosted the competition, the first being the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]]. Brazil will become the fifth country to have hosted the FIFA World Cup twice, after [[Mexico]], [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Germany]]. It will be the first World Cup to be held in [[South America]] since the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Argentina]], the first time two consecutive World Cups are staged outside Europe and the first time two consecutive World Cups are staged in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] (the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] was held in [[South Africa]]).

==Host selection==
[[File:Joseph Blatter - World Cup 2014.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sepp Blatter]] and the Brazilian victory.]]
{{Main|2014 FIFA World Cup bid process}}

On 7 March 2003, [[FIFA]] announced that the tournament would be held in South America for the first time since Argentina hosted the competition in [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]], in line with its policy of rotating the right to host the World Cup amongst different confederations. On 3 June 2003, [[CONMEBOL]] announced that [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], and [[Colombia]] wanted to host the 2014 World Cup finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/200301/19/eng20030119_110398.shtml |title=Argentina, Brazil and Colombia want 2014 World Cup |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2003-01-19 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 17 March 2004, the [[CONMEBOL]] associations had voted unanimously to adopt Brazil as their sole candidate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conmebol.com/index.jsp?slangab=E Blatter reiterates wish that the 2014 World Cup be in Brazil] {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil formally declared its candidacy in December 2006 and [[Colombia]] followed a few days later. The Argentina bid never materialized. On 11 April 2007, Colombia officially withdrew its bid, [[Francisco Santos CalderÃ³n]] the vice president of [[Colombia]] announced that instead Colombia would be hosting the [[2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. With this development, Brazil became the only official candidate to host the 2014 event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/releases/newsid=123706.html |title=Brazil confirms bid - Colombia withdraws |publisher=Fifa.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brazil won the right to [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2014 FIFA World Cup|host]] the event on 30 October 2007 as the only country to enter a bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=625695.html |title=Brazil confirmed as 2014 hosts |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2007-10-30 |publisher=FIFA |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031182910/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=625695.html  |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualification==
{{Main|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification}}

The qualification draw for the 2014 World Cup was held at the [[Marina da GlÃ³ria]] in Rio de Janeiro on 30 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/copa-do-mundo/noticia/2010/12/sorteio-das-eliminatorias-da-copa-sera-na-marina-da-gloria-no-rio.html|title=Draw for World Cup qualifiers at Marina da GlÃ³ria in Rio|publisher=globoesporte.com|date=8 December 2010|accessdate=21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the host nation, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] automatically qualifies for the tournament.
&lt;!--As with the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] finals, the defending champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]] do not qualify automatically and will have to participate in the qualification process.--&gt;

On 3 March 2011 FIFA decided to distribute places in the final tournament:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/bodies/media/newsid=1392053.html FIFA.com - Financial report presented, Brazil 2014 slots &amp; host countries decided]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pairings in play-off games will be determined prior to the main draw, taking place on 29 July 2011 in Rio de Janeiro at a press conference following the meeting of the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil Organising Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminarydraw/index.html|title=2014 FIFA World Cup Brazilâ¢ Preliminary Draw |publisher=fifa.com|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venues==
[[File:Dilma Roussef maquete mineirÃ£o.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dilma Rouseff]] and [[PelÃ©]] following the works in [[Belo Horizonte]].]]
Seventeen cities showed interest in being chosen as World Cup host cities: [[BelÃ©m]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[BrasÃ­lia]], [[Campo Grande]], [[CuiabÃ¡]], [[Curitiba]], [[FlorianÃ³polis]], [[Fortaleza]], [[GoiÃ¢nia]], [[Manaus]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Recife]], [[Olinda]] (a stadium would be shared by both cities), [[Rio Branco]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[SÃ£o Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/mission/fwc2014%5fbrazil%5fbid%5finspection%5freport%5fen%5f24491.pdf |title=FIFA's Inspection Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MaceiÃ³]] withdrew in January 2009.

According to current FIFA practice, no more than one city may use two stadiums, and the number of host cities is limited between eight and ten. The [[Brazilian Football Confederation]] (CBF) requested permission to assign 12 cities hosting World Cup Finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsya.com/noticia.php?id=155947&amp;id_estruc=1 &quot;FIFA wants to decide which cities will house World Cup 2014&quot;], Sportsya {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 December 2008, FIFA gave the green light to the 12-city plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/?action=read&amp;id=133956 |title=Mondiali 2014 in dodici cittÃ  |publisher=Tuttomercatoweb |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the 12 host cities were selected, there were few doubts that the chosen venue for the final match will be the [[EstÃ¡dio do MaracanÃ£|MaracanÃ£]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], which also hosted the [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|decisive match of the 1950 FIFA World Cup]]. Originally the CBF's intentions were to have the opening match at [[EstÃ¡dio do Morumbi]] in [[SÃ£o Paulo]], the largest city in Brazil. However, on 14 June 2010 the stadium was excluded from hosting games in the tournament due to a failure to provide financial guarantees for the improvements needed to have it as an eligible venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/2014-world-cup/news/1008887/Sao-Paulo-dropped-for-2014 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] |title=Sao Paulo dropped for 2014 |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of August 2010, the CBF announced that the [[new Corinthians Stadium]] would host the matches in SÃ£o Paulo.

The 12 host cities for the 2014 World Cup were announced on 31 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Host Cities for Brazil 2014 to be announced in May |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/brazil2014/news/newsid=1037180.html |work=FIFA.com |publisher=[[FIFA|FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association]] |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=6 June 2009 }} {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; BelÃ©m, Campo Grande, FlorianÃ³polis, GoiÃ¢nia and Rio Branco were rejected. Half of the chosen host cities will have their games in brand new venues built specifically for the World Cup, while the stadium for the capital [[Brasilia]] was demolished and will be rebuilt, and the remaining five are upgrading their current stadia.

==Logo==
[[File:2014 World Cup ceremony in Johannesburg 2010-07-08 2.jpg|thumb|right|The official Brazil 2014 logo.]]
The logo is called &quot;Inspiration&quot;, and was created by Brazilian agency ''Africa''. The design stems from an iconic photograph of three victorious hands together raising the world's most famous trophy. As well as depicting the humanitarian notion of hands interlinking, the portrayal of the hands is also symbolic of the yellow and green of Brazil warmly welcoming the world to their country. The logo was unveiled at a ceremony held in [[Johannesburg]] on 8 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/brazil2014/media/newsid=1270440.html#journey+brazil+2014+begins |title=Journey to Brazil 2014 begins |publisher=FIFA.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-11}} {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[FIFA]] and the Brazil LOC invited 25 Brazilian-based agencies to submit designs for the Official Emblem of the 2014 tournament and the task of picking the winner was awarded to a high-profile seven-strong judging panel consisting of CBF chairman [[Ricardo Teixeira]], FIFA executive secretary [[JÃ©rÃ´me Valcke]], supermodel [[Gisele BÃ¼ndchen]], architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]], writer [[Paulo Coelho]], singer [[Ivete Sangalo]], and designer Hans Donner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2010/07/10/gisele_picks_logo_shops_with_tom/ |title=Gisele picks logo, shops with Tom - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date= 10 July 2010|accessdate=2010-07-11 | first1=Mark | last1=Shanahan | first2=Meredith | last2=Goldstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian graphic designer Alexandre Wollner has criticized the design, suggesting it resembles a [[facepalm|hand covering a face in shame]], and the process through which it was chosen, having a jury that excluded professional graphic designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terramagazine.terra.com.br/interna/0,,OI4553699-EI6583,00-Designer+critica+logo+da+Copa+E+uma+porcaria.html |title=Designer critica logo da Copa 2014: &quot;Ã uma porcaria&quot; - Terra - Esportes |publisher=Terramagazine.terra.com.br |date= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBF estimates that the cost of construction and remodeling of stadiums&lt;ref&gt;[http://arogeraldes.blogspot.com/2007/10/brasil-2014-la-candidatura.html/ All Stadiums for Brazil 2014 World Cup] {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; alone will be approximately over R$1.9&amp;nbsp;billion ($1.1&amp;nbsp;billion, Â£ 550&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brazil.homesgofast.com/news/brazil-named-as-world-cup-2014-host-I544/ |title=Brazil Named as World Cup 2014 Host |publisher=Brazil.homesgofast.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the stadium upgrades and renovations, there will be millions more spent on basic infrastructure needs to get the country ready.

When informed of the decision to host the tournament, CBF President Ricardo Teixeira said: &quot;We are a civilized nation, a nation that is going through an excellent phase, and we have got everything prepared to receive adequately the honor to organize an excellent World Cup.&quot; Teixeira was on hand at FIFA's headquarters in [[ZÃ¼rich]] when the announcement was made.

&quot;Over the next few years we will have a consistent influx of investments. The 2014 World Cup will enable Brazil to have a modern infrastructure,&quot; Teixeira said. &quot;In social terms will be very beneficial. Our objective is to make Brazil become more visible in global arenas,&quot; he added. &quot;The World Cup goes far beyond a mere sporting event. It's going to be an interesting tool to promote social transformation.&quot;

===Airports===
On 31 August 2009 the state airport management agency [[Infraero]] unveiled a R$ 5.3&amp;nbsp;billion (approx. â¬3&amp;nbsp;billion, Â£ 2&amp;nbsp;billion) investment plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Rittner | first = Daniel | last2 = Braga | first2 = Paulo Victor | title = Infraero vai gastar R$5 bi em reforma de aeroportos | newspaper = Valor EconÃ´mico | pages = A4 | date = 31 August 2009 | language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; to upgrade airports of ten of the venue cities, increasing their capacity and comfort for the hundreds of thousands of tourists expected for the Cup. Natal and Salvador are excluded because their upgrade works have been recently completed. A significant amount (55.3%) of the money will be spent overhauling the airports of SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The investment figure covers works to be carried out up to 2014.

The announcement by Infraero came in reply to criticism made by the Brazilian General Aviation Association, a grouping of private aircraft owners, that Brazil's airports currently could not cope with the World Cup inflow. The vice-president of the association, Adalberto Febeliano, told reporters that more than 500,000 football fans were expected, with each one taking between six and fourteen flights during the tournament to get to the games in various cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Sports/Story/A1Story20080725-78670.html |title=Future airports of Brazil |publisher=Asiaone.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the [[Government of Brazil]] changed the bidding legislation to allow more flexibility to Infraero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.v-brazil.com/world-cup/2014/law-bureaucracy-airport-building-easier/ |title=Law reduces bureaucracy |publisher=V-brazil.com |date=2010-06-08 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development programme==
[[File:Sedes 2014.PNG|thumb|right|Brazilian states and cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.]]
The Brazilian federal government has earmarked R$ 3&amp;nbsp;billion (â¬ 1.8&amp;nbsp;billion, Â£ 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion) for investment in works relating to the 2014 World Cup, and intends to release a package of works, entitled the FIFA World Cup ''PAC'' (Portuguese acronym for [[Programa de AceleraÃ§Ã£o do Crescimento|Growth Acceleration Programme]]). According to the Brazilian minister of cities, MÃ¡rcio Fortes, the bulk of funds should go to works pertaining to the tournament itself, but the total figure will only be defined after a meeting with representatives of the [[municipalities]] that will host the matches.

&quot;This is only an initial figure. We have not set a figure yet. These R$3&amp;nbsp;billion will allow us to take the first step. The total value of projects is not known yet. We are going to hold talks with mayors to learn which projects are priorities,&quot; said the minister. The funds will be supplied by PrÃ³-Transporte, a financing programme funded by the Severance Pay Indemnity Fund (FGTS) whose regulation was passed last year by the fund's Board of Curators.

According to Fortes, several city councils have already contacted the ministry and showed interest in partnership for carrying out infrastructure work turned exclusively to the Cup that will be held in Brazil. &quot;For some time now, the city councils that will host the matches have been contacting us. The [[city council]]s have had meetings with FIFA and several projects were outlined. Our approach consists of dealing only with projects exclusively turned to the Cup. Our goal right now is not to solve transport-related issues in the city. We are going to help solve the issues pertaining to the events,&quot; he stated. According to the minister, another factor to be analysed by the Ministry of Cities is usefulness and [[sustainability]] of the investment after the competition is over. &quot;We are not going to deal with huge projects. The cheapest and most efficient means of transport will be used. Of course, each case will be analysed separately,&quot; he explained.[[File:Quarto tremnovodacptm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos|CPTM]] train in [[Greater SÃ£o Paulo]].]]

Fortes stated that the PAC of the Cup is going to include partnerships with city councils and [[States of Brazil|state]] governments, as well as some partnerships with the [[private sector]]. &quot;The keyword is partnership. The federal government will not undertake anything by itself. It will be similar to the infrastructure PAC, in which we already have partnerships with city councils and state governments, as well as public-private partnerships. We are going to review the type of investment proposed, analyse their size, and the need for private sector participation, which may take place in different ways. The private sector may build and then lease the assets, or perhaps operate them. All of that will be discussed,&quot; he stated.

The minister also informed that preparations for the World Cup already include the creation of a line of financing for renewing the bus fleet across the country. The line will be made available by the Brazilian Federal Savings Bank with total funds of R$1&amp;nbsp;billion (â¬ 600&amp;nbsp;million, Â£ 375&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.anba.com.br/noticia_esportes.kmf?cod=8705153 |title=Brazil-Arab news Agency - World Cup |publisher=.anba.com.br |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MaracanÃ£ projects===
[[File:Engenhao bot x por 002.jpg|thumb|right|[[EstÃ¡dio OlÃ­mpico JoÃ£o Havelange|EngenhÃ£o stadium]], will host the training centre for teams in Rio de Janeiro.]]
The [[EstÃ¡dio do MaracanÃ£|MaracanÃ£ Stadium]], in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], has been chosen for the [[final (competition)|final match]]. The MaracanÃ£ was inaugurated in the 1950 World Cup. For the 2014 World Cup, among other adaptations, a new cover will be built. The project also includes construction of a building for parking, above the lines of Supervia and subways, with 3,500 parking spaces. The estimated investment is R$ 460 million. According to the study of Sinaenco, there is a need to improve the visibility for spectators in the first few rows behind the cabins in the MaracanÃ£, redesign the facilities for people with [[Disability|disabilities]], and provide general health reform.

The project may also provide for the restoration of [[Quinta da Boa Vista]] and the Museum of SÃ£o CristÃ³vÃ£o, in addition to redevelopment and revitalization of neighborhoods including [[Tijuca]]. The [[EstÃ¡dio OlÃ­mpico JoÃ£o Havelange|EngenhÃ£o stadium]], completed for the [[2007 Pan American Games]], has a capacity of 45,000 people and will serve as a training ground for the World Cup.

An investment of R$ 5 billion is required to meet the requirements that Rio de Janeiro faces in the final tournament and other games, covering three areas: [[logistics]] (roads, railways, ports, waterways and airports), [[energy]] (generation and transmission of electric power, petroleum, natural gas and renewables) and [[social]] and [[urban area|urban]] (light, sanitation, housing, subways and water resources). In relation to the [[Rio de Janeiro Metro]], the [[Ministry of Transport (Brazil)|Ministry of Transport]] has held a public hearing regarding the extension of its lines. The line for the new project is {{convert|13.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and should cross the South Zone of the city, carrying around 200,000 [[passenger]]s per day between six [[metro station]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=nosso time |url=http://www.copa2014.org.br/noticias/296/OS+DESAFIOS+DO+RIO+DE+JANEIRO+PARA+A+COPA+2014.html |title=Rio and the final match of 2014 FIFA World Cup |publisher=Copa2014.org.br |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corinthians projects===
[[File:Cicero pompeu de toledo - aerial - 02.jpg|thumb|right|[[EstÃ¡dio do Morumbi|Morumbi stadium]], will host the training centre for teams in SÃ£o Paulo.]]
The [[New Corinthians Stadium]], in the city of [[SÃ£o Paulo]], has been chosen for the [[opening ceremony]]. [[SÃ£o Paulo]]'s chances of staging the [[opening ceremony]] of soccer's 2014 World Cup improved after FIFA accepted a guarantee that SC [[Corinthians]] Paulista's new stadium will be completed in time for the tournament. The stadium, being built by [[Odebrecht]] SA, will cost US$ 522 million, according to Corinthians President Andres Sanchez. [[BNDES]], the national development bank, pledged US$ 400 million and the city of SÃ£o Paulo will provide a property fund worth US$ 400 million.

On a statement on the Corinthians website, [[Ricardo Teixeira]], president of the World Cup local organising committee and the Brazilian Football Confederation, said: &quot;This approval -- in record time, less than a year -- is the result of efforts by the government of SÃ£o Paulo, particularly the Governor [[Geraldo Alckmin]] and Mayor [[Gilberto Kassab]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isportconnect sao-paulo-hopes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isportconnect.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7512:sao-paulo-hopes-of-hosting-2014-fifa-world-cup-opening-ceremony-boosted&amp;catid=23:stadia--venues-arena-infrastructure&amp;Itemid=32 |title=Sao Paulo Hopes of Hosting 2014 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony Boosted |publisher=Sportconnect |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA's approval of the project to build a new home for Brazil's biggest soccer club by revenue, which originally had a cost estimate of US$ 1.2 billion, was required for SÃ£o Paulo to host World Cup games.

In June 2011, then sports minister Orlando Silva said in an interview that the federal government would tell tournament organizer [[FIFA]] that SÃ£o Paulo, Salvador, Belo Horizonte and BrasÃ­lia are eligible to stage the opening ceremony. FIFA will announce the venue in October. Sanchez said: &quot;I said before that if Corinthians could fulfill all the requirements of FIFA, the opening of the World Cup would be in SÃ£o Paulo. Corinthians gave the guarantees required by FIFA, so the opening will be in SÃ£o Paulo.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;isportconnect sao-paulo-hopes&quot; /&gt; Most of the funding for investment in [[airport]]s, [[stadium]]s, [[port]]s and urban transportation before the World Cup will come from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=website group |url=http://www.isportconnect.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7512:sao-paulo-hopes-of-hosting-2014-fifa-world-cup-opening-ceremony-boosted&amp;catid=23:stadia--venues-arena-infrastructure&amp;Itemid=32 |title=Sao Paulo Hopes of Hosting 2014 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony Boosted |publisher=Sportconnect |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, host cities of the World Cup were concentrated in the southeast and south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dom, 31/05/09 |url=http://colunas.globoesporte.com/memoriaec/2009/05/31/sedes-da-copa-de-1950-voltam-no-mundial-de-2014/ |title=Host cities in 1950 FIFA World Cup |publisher=Colunas.globoesporte.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the host cities are more evenly distributed. Each host city is the capital of its [[States of Brazil|state]]. The selection covers all the main [[regions of Brazil]] and as a result the tournament will require significant long-distance travel for teams. Brazil is the fifth largest nation in the world by geographical size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/01062009/58/world-cup-qual-fifa-announce-brazil-2014-host-cities.html Selection - Regions of Brazil]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brazil straddles the [[equator]], all the proposed match venues are in the [[southern hemisphere]], meaning that the games will be held in the [[winter]] period (although most venues for the tournament are situated in the [[tropics]]). The cold front comes from [[Antarctica]] causing cold weather in the south and central part of the country, and rainy weather in the north. However, the future stadiums are being prepared for these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brcactaceae.org/clima.html |title=Winter in Brazil during the FIFA World Cup |publisher=Brcactaceae.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA agreed to increase the number of host cities from ten to 12 because of the size of Brazil. &quot;In the very beginning, ten cities were going to be chosen, but thanks to the influence of [CBF president] Ricardo Teixeira and the interest of the whole country, we agreed increasing the number to twelve,&quot; said FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]]. Teixeira briefed FIFA members about all 17 candidate cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8075256.stm |title=Host cities - World Cup |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-05-31 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reported US$1&amp;nbsp;billion (approx. Â£650&amp;nbsp;million) is to be approved for the repair, upgrading and maintenance of Brazilian stadiums. However, aiming to build &quot;state of the art&quot; stadiums and, therefore, increasing their chances to be part of 2014's tournament, some Brazilian states are searching for expertise abroad. Recently delegations from [[Recife]] and [[Porto Alegre]], for example, visited the [[Amsterdam Arena]] in order to understand the formula which made that stadium highly profitable. Amsterdam Arena, the home of [[AFC Ajax]], has developed and is offering its expertise on the multi-use-purpose stadium concept and management. Amsterdam Arena has been developed to accommodate not only football matches but also concerts and events. Amsterdam Arena is currently developing two projects for Brazil: [[Recife]]/[[Olinda]] and [[Porto Alegre]] (GrÃªmio).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brazilinsight.nl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1001&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Brazil Insight - Dutch and English website |publisher=Brazilinsight.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brazilian government]] said authorities will have an efficient [[security]] plan in place for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Justice Minister JosÃ© Eduardo Cardoso said in an interview with Brazilian radio stations that &quot;the 2014 World Cup will be a very safe event.&quot; One of the security measures that the government plans to implement is [[facial recognition software]], in which [[Brazilian police]] will use futuristic [[Robocop]]-[[style]] [[glasses]] fitted with facial recognition equipment to identify and root out troublemakers at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

A small [[camera]] fitted to the glasses can capture 400 [[facial]] [[images]] per second and send them to a central computer database storing up to 13 million faces. Minister Cardoso said the government is developing a public safety plan that will be unveiled &quot;soon.&quot; The 2014 FIFA World Cup will be held in 12 cities throughout Brazil. Played every four years, the month long tournament from June to July is expected to attract hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven McLoud |url=http://www.dialogo-americas.com/en_GB/articles/rmisa/features/sports/2011/10/13/feature-ex-2593 |title=Brazil Guarantees Efficient Security Plan for 2014 FIFA World Cup |publisher=DiÃ¡logo |date=2011/10/13 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary JosÃ© Ricardo Botelho is facing perhaps the most important mission of his life as a civil servant. Heading the newly created Special Secretariat for the Security of Large Events, Botelho has the task of ensuring the safety of [[Brazilians]] and [[tourist]]s during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. To this end, he has developed what might be called an obsession: to integrate the security forces of a country with continental dimensions like Brazil. To prove that the goal will be achieved, he draws on History, his other obsession: &quot;People who have a history know where they want to go.&quot;

Integration is the keyword in the Strategic Security Plan prepared for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In addition to ensuring quick responses, the plan provides for an integrated security system that can be left as a legacy to the country. In total, an estimated 45,000 men linked to the security forces will be mobilized, not to mention reinforcements from the [[Brazilian Armed Forces]] and Civil Defense. &quot;The country does not need to create anything new, but just to integrate its existing tools,&quot; he said. According to JosÃ© Ricardo Botelho, the databases of federal and state security forces will be integrated with the [[Interpol]] [[database]], which means connecting Brazil to 188 countries. In addition, the government has already sent documents to the [[United States]], [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Holland]], [[South Africa]], [[Poland]] and [[Argentina]] requesting information about [[terrorist]]s, &quot;troublemakers&quot; and hooligans.

&quot;We want to work proactively rather than defensively; hence the importance of technology. We are linking everything so that when a person fitting this profile applies for a [[visa]], for example, we will already have the first barrier in place. But in the case of a country for which an entry visa is not required, when the person gets to our [[border]]s he or she will not be allowed into Brazil. But what if he or she does? We are working with state-of-the-art equipment to identify these people. We do not want them among us,&quot; says the commissioner. [[Technology]] pervades all discussions of the Security Plan for the World Cup. Teams from the Special Secretariat for the Security of Large Events are visiting he 12 host cities to follow civil works in the stadiums that will be hosting World Cup games. Anti-bomb groups are monitoring the works up to delivery, in order to ensure that no artifacts are hidden inside pillars and foundations.

In addition to security in the stadiums, the Secretariat for the Security of Large Events is keeping a close eye on [[Fan (person)|fan]] [[fest]]s. Each host city will have an operational command center with representatives of the [[Brazilian police|police]], the Armed Forces, the Fire Department and Civil Defense. There, decision-making promises to be quick. The central command headquarters will be located in [[BrasÃ­lia]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=our team |url=http://www.copa2014.gov.br/noticia/integration-keyword-strategic-security-plan?language=en |title=ntegration is the keyword in the Strategic Security Plan |publisher=World Cup Portal |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil is training of 53,000 public safety professionals for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The professionals will be be made by the state governments for each individual games venue. They will be trained in three categories: experts, multipliers (who will help to transfer knowledge to other professionals) and operators. The training courses will include &quot;[[Public safety]] without [[homophobia]]&quot;, application of human rights in policing, [[Brazilian Sign Language]] and [[foreign languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cenag.uol.com.br/noticias_ler.php?id=NzQwMw== Brazilian police without homophobia {{pt icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anti-fraud plan==
[[File:Launch of portals for 2014 FIFA World Cup &amp; 2016 Summer Olympics 2010-05-04 1.jpg|thumb|right|Launch of Transparency Portal.]]
On 11 June 2010, the federal government launched a program to protect the tenders for work in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the [[2016 Olympic Games]] against the possibility of fraud. The plan, known as ''Jogando Limpo'' (''Fair Play''), includes a series of guidelines and nuggets of advice so that the government institutions, and also the tax authorities and common citizens themselves, may identify and denounce attempts at fraud against the tenders. The program, which was launched by the Ministries for Justice and for Sport, also plans the establishment of a group dedicating to monitoring tenders, to protect them against the threat of fraud and also to avoid delays in construction work.

This initiative, also boosted by the General Financial Controller of the Union (Controladoria Geral da UniÃ£o), also plans a campaign to make the people aware of the need to pay attention to possible fraud and to always denounce the cases. The program emphasizes measures against cartels and possible agreements between competing companies to set prices above market levels, in an attempt to raise the value of the contracts with the state. &quot;Nothing can be worse than someone taking advantage of these two great opportunities to commit crimes. This is a world phenomenon,&quot; said the Minister for Justice, Luiz Paulo Barreto, during the ceremony to launch the program.

&quot;The businesspeople could be entering with an agreement on prices, in order to compete in these tenders. This is something that needs to be tackled. We need to promote fair play also in our tenders,&quot; Barreto added. &quot;Fair play is something we would expect from a country intending to host events of this size,&quot; he added. Barreto also said that, between 2007 and 2010, there were a total of 265 search and seizure warrants issued in Brazil to tackle the crime of cartel formation. In the same period over 100 people were preventively arrested for the same crime, and currently an additional 251 people are being investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=our team |url=http://www.copa2014.org.br/en/news/3784/GOVERNMENT+LAUNCHES+ANTIFRAUD+PLAN+FOR+WORLD+CUP+AND+OLYMPIC+GAMES.html |title=Anto-fraud plan in Brazil |publisher=Copa2014.org.br |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tax breaks==

Brazil's federal government announced on 17 May 2010 that it shall be granting [[tax break]]s for the construction and refurbishment of the stadiums for the 2014 World Cup. In a note, the Ministry for the Treasury said that it shall be &quot;granting tax exemption to the stadiums of the World Cup, which shall not need to pay Industrialized Products Tax (Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados - IPI), Importation Tax (Imposto de ImportaÃ§Ã£o - II) or social contributions (PIS/COFINS).&quot;

In addition, the 12 cities that shall be hosting the World Cup matches shall be able to grant exemption from State Value Added Tax (Imposto sobre CirculaÃ§Ã£o de Mercadorias e ServiÃ§os - ICMS) on all operations involving merchandise and other goods for the construction or the refurbishment of the stadiums. &quot;Conditional on the cumulative concession of the benefits involving Importation Tax, IPI and PIS/COFINS, the exemption of ICMS on imports shall only be applicable if the [[good (economics)|goods]] do not have a similar product produced nationally,&quot; the note informed, adding that this decision shall be made feasible through a [[Law]] or Provisional [[Local ordinance|Measure]].

In September 2009, the [[Brazilian Development Bank]] (Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento EconÃ´mico e Social - BNDES) opened a credit line of R$ 4.8&amp;nbsp;billion (approx. â¬2.7&amp;nbsp;billion, Â£ 1.75&amp;nbsp;billion) for the World Cup stadiums. Each host city shall be able to finance up to R$ 400&amp;nbsp;million (approx. â¬225&amp;nbsp;million, Â£ 145&amp;nbsp;million) or 75% of the project, with bank funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.copa2014.org.br/en/news/3028/BRAZIL+SHALL+GRANT+TAX+BREAKS+FOR+2014+STADIUMS.html|title=Brazil shall grant tax breaks for 2014 stadiums |date=2010-05-18 |accessdate=2007-10-30 |publisher=Portal 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
