'''''Hypomasculinity''''' is a psychological term for the absence of male stereotypical behaviour, for example, the absence of the de-emphasising of feelings, relationships, etc. A [[Jungian]] interpretation of this would be of an overwhelmingly strong [[Anima (Jung)|anima]] or female complex. This term can be [[pejorative]] and it is important not to place a moral interpretation on whether it is desirable, only by whether it is [[adaptive]] or [[maladaptive]]. Its opposite behaviour is termed ''[[hypermasculinity]]''.
