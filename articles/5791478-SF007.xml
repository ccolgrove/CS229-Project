Interactive Movie Guide''' was a reference and educational application produced by [[Microsoft]] and published annually beginning in 1992. The software was mainly a database of films, in a similar fashion to the [[Internet Movie Database]], and gave descriptions of the films and who starred in them. Most of this information was not readily accessible before broadband internet.

Cinemania contained professional material by:
* [[Leonard Maltin]]: 19,000 reviews from his ''Movie and Video Guide''
* [[Roger Ebert]]: over 1300 reviews from his ''Video Companion'' (starting from the 2nd edition, published as Cinemania '94)
* [[Pauline Kael]]: 2500 reviews from her ''5001 Nights at the movies'' book (also starting with Cinemania '94)
* [[Baseline]]: ''The Motion Picture Guide'' and ''The Encyclopedia of Film''
* [[James Monaco]]: ''How to Read a Film''
* [[Ephraim Katz]]: ''The Film Encyclopedia''

The program also included over 2000 [[image|still images]] for movies and actors, a large amount of sound clips, dialogs and soundtracks, and a smaller selection of full-motion [[video]] clips. As the amount of material increased with each new edition, the quality of media tended to decrease, in order to fit everything on a single CD-ROM.

The last edition of Cinemania was released in 1997. This version was available for [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Personal Computer|PCs]] running [[Windows 95]] or [[Windows NT]] with an [[Intel 80486]] processor, or [[Apple Macintosh]]es running [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7]]. Cinemania 97 also had guided tours from numerous celebrities and online features which made use of an associated [[MSN]] website. It could be updated monthly over the Internet, which brought new movies, new material about older movies and new celebrity tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
