The '''Copa del Rey 1914''' was the 12nd edition of the [[Copa del Rey]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Association football|football]] cup. 

The competition started on March 29, 1914 and concluded on May 10, 1914 with the Final, held at the [[Estadio de Amute]] in [[Irun]], in which [[Athletic Bilbao]] lifted the trophy for the 5th time ever with a 2â1 victory over [[FC Espanya de Barcelona|EspaÃ±a de Barcelona]].

The [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] took complete control of the cup tournament and decided that the clubs of the existing regional championship would qualify for the national cup championship; no free entry would be permitted anymore. Apart from some exception, the elimination rounds were played in two matches (home and away) from this season onwards. 

==Teams==
* '''North Region''': [[Athletic Bilbao]]
* '''Center Region''': [[Sociedad GimnÃ¡stica EspaÃ±ola|Sociedad GimnÃ¡stica]]
* '''South Region''': [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla BalompiÃ©]]&lt;ref&gt;The champions of the South Region did not inscribe for the tournament (actually, Sevilla BalompiÃ© was going to participate as champion of &quot;Seville Cup&quot;, a tournament played by Seville clubs, as South Region Championship was not created until 1915).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''': [[Real Vigo Sporting|Real Vigo SC]]
* '''[[Catalonia]]''': [[FC Espanya de Barcelona|EspaÃ±a FC]]
