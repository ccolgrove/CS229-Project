'''Zellweger syndrome''', also called cerebrohepatorenal syndrome is a rare, [[congenital disorder]], characterized by the reduction or absence of functional [[peroxisome]]s in the cells of an individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2454948&quot;&gt;{{cite pmid|2454948}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a family of disorders called [[leukodystrophies]]. Zellweger syndrome is named after [[Hans Zellweger]], a former professor of [[Pediatrics]] and [[Genetics]] at the [[University of Iowa]] who researched this [[Disease|disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|1670}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1915492&quot;&gt;{{cite pmid|1915492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Molecular basis of disease ==
Zellweger syndrome is an [[autosomal recessive]] disorder caused by mutations in genes that encode peroxins, proteins required for the normal assembly of [[peroxisomes]]. Most commonly, patients have mutations in the ''[[PEX1]]'', ''[[PEX2]]'', ''[[PEX3]]'', ''[[PEX5]]'', ''[[PEX6]]'', ''[[PEX10]]'', ''[[PEX12]]'', ''[[PEX13]]'', ''[[PEX14]]'', ''[[PEX16]]'', ''[[PEX19]]'', and ''[[PEX26]]'' genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|214100|Zellweger syndrome; ZS|accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all cases, patients have mutations that inactivate or greatly reduce the activity of both the maternal and paternal copies of one these aforementioned ''PEX'' genes.

As a result of impaired [[peroxisome]] function, an individual's tissues and cells can accumulate very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) that are normally degraded in [[peroxisomes]]. The accumulation of these lipids can impair the normal function of multiple organ systems, as discussed below. In addition, these individuals can show deficient levels of [[plasmalogens]], ether-phospholipids that are especially important for brain and lung function.

== Clinical manifestations of disease ==
Zellweger syndrome is one of three [[peroxisome biogenesis disorders]] which belong to the Zellweger spectrum of peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD-ZSD).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17055079&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|17055079}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two disorders are [[neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy]] (NALD), and [[infantile Refsum disease]] (IRD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetests.org/query?dz=pbd GeneReviews: Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders, Zellweger Syndrome Spectrum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17041890&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid| 17041890}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although all have a similar molecular basis for disease, Zellweger syndrome is the most severe of these three disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1007/978-0-387-30378-9_26&quot;&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1007/978-0-387-30378-9_26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zellweger syndrome is associated with impaired neuronal migration, neuronal positioning, and [[brain development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17055079&quot;/&gt; In addition, individuals with Zellweger syndrome can show a reduction in [[central nervous system]] (CNS) [[myelin]] (particularly cerebral), which is referred to as [[hypomyelination]]. Myelin is critical for normal CNS functions and, in this regard, serves to insulate nerve fibers in the brain. Patients can also show postdevelopmental sensorineuronal degeneration that leads to a progressive loss of hearing and vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17055079&quot;/&gt;

Zellweger syndrome can also affect the function of many other organ systems. Patients can show craniofacial abnormalities (such as a high forehead, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, epicanthal folds, midface hypoplasia, and a large fontanel), [[hepatomegaly]] (enlarged liver), [[chondrodysplasia punctata]] (punctate calcification of the cartilage in specific regions of the body), eye abnormalities, and [[renal cysts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17055079&quot;/&gt; Newborns may present with profound [[hypotonia]] (low muscle tone), seizures, apnea, and an inability to eat.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17055079&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1007/978-0-387-30378-9_26&quot;/&gt;

== Molecular diagnostics ==
In addition to genetic tests involving the sequencing of ''PEX'' genes,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15542397&quot;&gt;{{cite pmid|15542397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19105186&quot;&gt;{{cite pmid|19105186}}&lt;/ref&gt; biochemical tests have proven highly effective for the diagnosis of Zellweger syndrome and other peroxisomal disorders.  Typically, Zellweger syndrome patients show elevated [[very long chain fatty acids]] in their [[blood plasma]].  Cultured primarily skin fibroblasts obtained from patients show elevated [[very long chain fatty acids]], impaired [[very long chain fatty acid]] [[beta-oxidation]], [[phytanic acid]] [[alpha-oxidation]], [[pristanic acid]] [[alpha-oxidation]], and [[plasmalogen]] biosynthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17055079&quot;/&gt;

==Prognosis==
Currently, there is no cure for Zellweger syndrome, nor is there a standard course of treatment. Infections should be guarded against to prevent such complications as [[pneumonia]] and respiratory distress. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Patients usually do not survive beyond one year of age.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17055079&quot;/&gt;
