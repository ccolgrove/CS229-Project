&lt;!-- As previously mentioned, although I have found this 35th track on the iTunes download of the album, I do not own the original CD, and therefore do not know of a certainty that this track is on it.  As a result, I have removed it for the moment, subject to verification by someone who owns the CD.  This edit was redone on Dec 13th, as the original edit was considered potentially vandalous, and automatically undone.  -AK &lt;!-- There is a 35th track on this album.  Not sure what the English translation is, as my Japanese is sketchy, but perhaps someone else can translate it. -AK --/&gt;
