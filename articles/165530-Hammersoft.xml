'''Bournemouth''' ({{Audio|en-uk-Bournemouth.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a large coastal resort [[town]] in the [[ceremonial county]] of [[Dorset]], England. According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] the town has a population of 163,444, making it the largest settlement in Dorset. It is also the largest settlement between [[Southampton]] and [[Plymouth]]. With [[Poole]] and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], Bournemouth forms the [[South East Dorset conurbation]], which has a total population of approximately 400,000.

Founded in 1810 by [[Lewis Tregonwell]], Bournemouth's growth accelerated with the arrival of the railway, becoming a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of [[Hampshire]], it joined Dorset with the [[Local Government Act 1972|reorganisation of local government in 1974]]. Since 1997 the town has been administered by a [[unitary authority]], meaning that it has autonomy from [[Dorset County Council]]. The local authority is [[Bournemouth Borough Council]].

Bournemouth's location on the south coast of England has made it a popular destination for tourists. The town is a regional centre of business, home of the [[Bournemouth International Centre]] and financial companies that include [[Liverpool Victoria]] and [[PruHealth]].

In a 2007 survey by [[First Direct]], Bournemouth was found to be the happiest place in Britain, with 82% of people questioned saying they were happy with their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/6431649.stm| work=BBC News| date=2007-03-08| title=Bournemouth happiest town in UK| accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Bournemouth 02.JPG|thumb|left|Bournemouth Beach and [[Boscombe]] Pier]]
Bournemouth is located {{convert|105|mi|km|0}} southwest of London at {{Coord|50.72|N|1.88|W|region:GB-DOR|display=title,inline}}. The urban geography of Bournemouth is complex: the town adjoins Poole in the west and Christchurch in the east to form the [[South East Dorset conurbation]]. The combined population is 383,713, and it is a retail and commercial centre. To the north west of Bournemouth is the small town of [[Wimborne]] and to the north east is the settlement of [[Ferndown]]. [[Bournemouth Airport]] lies to the north east, towards [[Hurn]]. The town is intersected by the [[A338 road|A338]] dual carriageway, known as the &quot;Wessex Way&quot;.

Although Bournemouth is on the coast, the centre of the town lies inland - the commercial and civil heart of the town being [[The Square, Bournemouth|the Square]]. From the Square the Upper and Lower [[Pleasure gardens|Pleasure Gardens]] descend to the seafront and the pier. Areas within Bournemouth include [[Bear Cross]], [[Boscombe]], [[Kinson]], [[Pokesdown]], [[Westbourne, Dorset|Westbourne]] and [[Winton, Dorset|Winton.]] Traditionally a large retirement town, Bournemouth (mostly the Northbourne, Southbourne and Tuckton areas of Bournemouth together with the Wallisdown, and [[Talbot Village]] areas of Poole) has seen massive growth in recent years, especially through the growth of students attending [[Bournemouth University]] and the large number of language schools teaching English as a foreign language.

Bournemouth is located directly to the east of the [[Jurassic Coast]], a {{convert|95|mi|km|sing=on}} section of beautiful and largely unspoilt coastline recently designated a [[World Heritage Site]]. Apart from the beauty of much of the coastline, the Jurassic Coast provides a complete geological record of the [[Jurassic period]] and a rich [[fossil record]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Eocene Cliffs, with Leaf Bed, of Bournemouth, Dorset.| publisher=School of Ocean and Earth Science, Southampton University| first=Ian| last=West| month=August| year=2007| url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/bourne.htm| accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bournemouth sea front overlooks [[Poole Bay]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. Bournemouth also has {{convert|7|mi|km}} of sandy [[beach]]es that run from [[Hengistbury Head]] in the east to [[Sandbanks]], in Poole, in the west.

Because of the coastal processes that operate in Poole Bay, the area is often used for [[surfing]]. An [[Artificial reef#Artificial surfing reefs|artificial reef]] (Europe's first) was expected to be installed at [[Boscombe]], in Bournemouth, by October 2008, using large sand-filled [[geotextile]] bags. However, this deadline was not met, and the construction was actually finished at the end of October 2009. The [[Boscombe Surf Reef|Boscombe Reef]] was constructed as part of the larger Boscombe Spa Village development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Boscombe Spa Village Surfing| publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council| url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/spa/surfing/| accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bournemouth also has several [[chine]]s (e.g. Alum Chine) that lead down to the beaches and form a very attractive feature of the area. The beaches are subdivided by [[groyne]]s.

===Climate===
Due to its location on the south coast, Bournemouth has a [[temperate]] climate with moderate variation in annual and daily temperatures: from 1971 to 2000 the annual [[mean]] temperature was {{convert|10.2|to|12|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;annualmean&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/19712000/tmean/17.gif | title = Mean Temperature Annual Average | publisher = [[Met Office]] | accessdate = 2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warmest months are July and August, which have an average temperature range of {{convert|12|to|22|C|F}}, while the coolest months are January and February, which have an average temperature range of {{convert|1|to|8|C|F}}. Average rainfall in Bournemouth is around {{convert|800|mm|0|abbr=on}} annually, well below the national average of 1,126 millimetres. Since 1960, temperature extremes as measured at Bournemouth Hurn Airport have ranged from {{convert|34.1|C|F}} in August 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=14&amp;year=1990&amp;indexid=TXx&amp;stationid=1867 | title = 1990 temperature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  down to {{convert|-13.4|C|F}} in January 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=7&amp;year=1963&amp;indexid=TNn&amp;stationid=2133 | title = 1963 temperature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest temperature to be recorded in recent years was {{convert|-10.4|C|F}} during December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publisher = [[UKMO]] | url= http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/heavy-snow-before-less-cold-air-arrives/ | title = 2010 temperature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
Historically Bournemouth was part of Hampshire, with Poole just to the west of the border. At the time of the [[Local Government Act 1972|1974 local government re-organisation]], it was considered desirable that the whole of the [[South East Dorset conurbation|Poole/Bournemouth urban area]] should be part of the same county. Bournemouth therefore became part of the [[non-metropolitan county]] of Dorset on 1 April 1974. On 1 April 1997, Bournemouth became a [[unitary authority]], independent from Dorset [[County Council]]. For the purposes of [[Lord Lieutenant|the Lieutenancy]] it remains part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Dorset.

For local elections the district is divided into 18 wards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/atlas/ Local Election Map]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bournemouth Borough Council]] is elected every four years. The Council elects the Mayor and Deputy Mayor annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Constitution/Part2/part2_article5.asp Bournemouth Borough Council Constitution (part)]&lt;/ref&gt; For 2009-2010, the Mayor of Bournemouth is Mrs. Beryl Baxter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Council/Mayor/default.asp Bournemouth Borough Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Bournemouth}}
[[File:Lewis Tregonwell.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A statue near the seafront, of [[Lewis Tregonwell]], the founder of the original settlement which became Bournemouth.]]
The [[Dorset]] and [[Hampshire]] region surrounding Bournemouth has been the site of human settlement for thousands of years. However, in 1800 the Bournemouth area was largely a remote and barren [[heathland]]. No one lived at the mouth of the [[River Bourne, Dorset|Bourne River]] and the only regular visitors were a few fishermen, turf cutters and gangs of [[Smuggling|smugglers]] until the 16th century. During the [[Tudor period]] the area was used as a hunting estate, 'Stourfield Chase', but by the late 18th century only a few small parts of it were maintained, including several fields around the Bourne Stream and a cottage known as Decoy Pond House, which stood near where [[The Square, Bournemouth|the Square]] is today.&lt;ref name=&quot;EE&quot;&gt;[[Elizabeth Edwards]], ''A History of Bournemouth'', Phillimore &amp; Co, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Invalids' walk, Bournemouth, Dorset, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|right|[[Photochrom]] of Invalids' walk, 1890s]]
With the exception of the estate, until 1802 most of the Bournemouth area was [[common land]]. The [[Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802]] and the Inclosure Commissioners' Award of 1805 transferred hundreds of acres into private ownership for the first time. In 1809, the Tapps Arms [[public house]] appeared on the heath. A few years later, in 1812, the first residents, retired army officer [[Lewis Tregonwell]] and his wife, moved into their new home built on land he had purchased from [[George Ivison Tapps|Sir George Ivison Tapps]]. Tregonwell began developing his land for holiday letting by building a series of sea [[villa]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;EE&quot;/&gt; In association with Tapps, he planted hundreds of [[pine trees]], providing a sheltered walk to the beach (later to become known as the 'Invalids walk'). The town would ultimately grow up around its scattered pines. In 1832 when Tregonwell died, Bournemouth had grown into small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages.&lt;ref name=&quot;EE&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Bournemouth town hall.jpg|thumb|left|Bournemouth Town Hall was built in the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], originally serving as a hotel for visitors to the town.]]
In 1835, after the death of Sir George Ivison Tapps, his son Sir [[George William Tapps-Gervis]] inherited his father's estate. Bournemouth started to grow at a faster rate as George William started developing the seaside village into a resort similar to those that had already grown up along the south coast such as [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] and [[Brighton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EE&quot;/&gt; In 1841, the town was visited by the physician and writer [[Augustus Granville]]. Granville was the author of ''The Spas of England'', which described health resorts around the country. As a result of his visit, Dr Granville included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of the book, as well as the growth of visitors to the seaside seeking the medicinal use of the seawater and the fresh air of the pines, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.&lt;ref name=&quot;EE&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Bournemouth Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|The Bournemouth Pleasure Gardens, laid out in the 1840s and 1860s. The Victorian Folly was added later.]]
[[File:Entrance to the pier, Bournemouth, England, 1890s.jpg|thumb|right|[[Photochrom]] of the entrance to the pier, 1890s]]
[[File:Bournemouth WarMemorial.jpg|thumb|right|The Bournemouth War Memorial, built in 1921, located in the Bourne Gardens.]]
In the 1840s the fields south of the road crossing (later Bournemouth Square) were drained and laid out with shrubberies and walks. Many of these paths including the 'Invalids walk' remain in the town today; forming part of the Pleasure Gardens which extend for several miles along the [[River Bourne, Dorset|Bourne]] stream. The Pleasure Gardens were originally a series of garden walks created in the fields of the owners of the [[Branksome, Dorset|Branksome]] Estate in the 1860s. In the early 1870s all the fields were leased to the Bournemouth Commissioners by the freeholders.&lt;ref name=&quot;EE&quot;/&gt; Parliament approved the Bournemouth Improvement Act in 1856. Under the Act, a board of 13 Commissioners was established to build and organise the expanding infrastructure of the town, such as paving, sewers, drainage, street lighting and street cleaning.

During the late 19th century the town continued to develop. The Winter Gardens were finished in 1875 and the cast iron Bournemouth [[Pier]] was finished in 1880. The arrival of the railways allowed a massive growth of seaside and summer visits to the town, especially by visitors from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and London. In 1880 the town had a population of 17,000 people but by 1900, when railway connections were at their most developed to Bournemouth, the town's population had risen to 60,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;EE&quot;/&gt; It was also during this period that the town became a favourite location for visiting artists and writers. The town was improved greatly during this period through the efforts of Sir [[Merton Russell-Cotes]], the town's mayor and a local [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]]. He helped establish the town's first library and museum. The [[Russell-Cotes Art Gallery &amp; Museum]] was housed in his mansion and after his death it was given to the town.

As Bournemouth's growth increased in the early 20th century, the town centre spawned [[theatre]]s, [[cafÃ©]]s, two [[art deco]] [[movie theater|cinemas]] and more hotels. Other new buildings included the war memorial in 1921 and the Bournemouth Pavilion, the town's concert hall and grand theatre, finished in 1925. The town escaped great damage during the [[Second World War]] but saw a period of decline as a [[seaside resort]] in the postwar era.

The [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] stationed an inshore [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] at Bournemouth in 1965 but it was withdrawn in 1972. Coverage for the area has otherwise been provided from [[Poole Lifeboat Station]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Denton |first= Tony |title= Handbook 2009 |year= 2009 |publisher= Lifeboat Enthusiasts Society |location= Shrewsbury |page= 59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Bournemouth became the first town in the [[United Kingdom]] to introduce and use [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] cameras for public street-based surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisdorset.net/mostpopular.var.1893364.mostviewed.fights_camera_action.php CCTV This is Dorset], accessdate = 2008-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monbiot.com/archives/1997/02/21/multi-issue-politics/ History of CCTV], accessdate = 2008-02-01&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature references==
Bournemouth appears as Sandbourne in [[Thomas Hardy]]'s novels. [[Tess of the D'Urbervilles|Tess]] lived in Sandbourne with Alec d'Urberville, and the town also features in [[The Well-Beloved]] and [[Jude the Obscure]]. It is also mentioned in ''[[So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish]]'', the fourth book of the [[Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] trilogy. In [[James Herbert]]'s horror novel ''[[The Fog (1975 novel)|The Fog]]'', the entire population of Bournemouth runs into the sea and drowns in a mass suicide. In [[Andy McDermott]]'s thriller ''The Secret of Excalibur'', a car chase through the town centre and beach front leads to the destruction of the IMAX Cinema. It is also mentioned in [[Roald Dahl]]'s [[The Witches (book)|''The Witches'']] as the setting for the Hotel Magnificent.

The town was especially rich in literary associations during the late 19th century and earlier years of the 20th century. [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Paul Verlaine]] both taught at Bournemouth [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]]s. [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] wrote ''[[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' and most of his novel [[Kidnapped (novel)|''Kidnapped'']] from his house &quot;Skerryvore&quot; on the west cliff. Count [[Vladimir Chertkov]] established a [[Tolstoyan]] publishing house with other [[Russia]]n exiles in Iford Waterworks at Southbourne, and under the 'Free Age Press' imprint, published the first edition of several works by [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]], however the author himself never visited the town.

In Peter Weir's highly acclaimed 1975 film adaptation of Joan Lindsay's enigmatic 1968 novel, ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', bygone holidays at Bournemouth are wistfully recalled by Mrs. Appleyard (played by [[Rachel Roberts]]), headmistress of Mrs. Appleyard's College for Girls, in [[Australia]].

Bournemouth is a tourist and regional centre for leisure, entertainment, culture and recreation. The award-winning Central Gardens are a separate major [[Park#Public Parks|public park]], leading for several miles down the valley of the [[River Bourne, Dorset|River Bourne]] through the centre of the town to the sea (reaching the sea at Bournemouth Pier) and include the Pleasure Gardens and the area surrounding the Pavilion and the now closed [[IMAX]] Cinema. It has a thriving youth culture, including a large university population and many language school students. With the advent of the Boscombe Overstrand, the seeds of a dynamic new business culture revolving around new media and surfing have begun to emerge. Bournemouth also has a well-established gay scene comprising a cluster of bars, restaurants, the Bondi (the South's only exclusively GLBT Hotel) and nightclubs all centred around the Triangle in the centre of the town. Bournemouth is known for its popularity with pensioners and it has many residential care homes.

In recent years, Bournemouth has become a popular nightlife destination with UK tourists. Many clubs, bars and restaurants are located within the town centre. Bliss, Chilli White, Lava &amp; Ignite and Mary Shelley operate on St. Peter's Road. In addition, 'V', the converted St. Andrew's Church, since April 2009 has become very popular within the town's night time entertainment.

===Religion and beliefs===
Bournemouth contains places of worships for many denominations. The town has several examples of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian church architecture]]. These include St Stephen's Church, which was built for services under the influence of the [[Oxford Movement]] and was finished in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ststephensbournemouth.org/ St Stephen's Church, Bournemouth], Accessed 2008-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt; St Stephen's Church was the place of the marriage between [[Ebba Munck af Fulkila]] and Prince [[Oscar, Prince Bernadotte|Oscar of Sweden]] in 1888. Also included is the Richmond Hill St Andrew's Church, part of the [[United Reformed Church]]. The church was built in 1865 and enlarged in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouth-urc.org.uk/overview.htm Richmond Hill St Andrew's Church], Accessed 2008-04-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Another ex-church, St. Andrew's on Exeter Road, has now become a popular entertainments venue known as 'V' in the town centre.

Recently, the Bournemouth International Centre has become a venue for a round of the [[Premier League Darts]] Championship organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation]]. It was rated as one of the favourites to become the new host for the PDC World Championships as the last site, Circus Tavern, could not hold the growing numbers of fans.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Bournemouth also has a thriving watersports community with its beaches having great conditions for [[windsurfing]] and [[kitesurfing]]. On a windy day you can see many kitesurfers and windsurfers out enjoying the waves all the way along the beach from Hengistbury Head to Sandbanks, and there are quite a few local schools for the beginner to learn either sport. There is a local kiteboarding club, Bournemouth Boarding, which is recognised by the BKSA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouthboarding.co.uk/ Bournemouth Boarding], Accessed 6 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shopping===
The main shopping streets in the centre of town are just behind the seafront on either side of the River Bourne (also known as the Bourne Stream); footpaths lead down to the sea from the Square through the lower section of Bournemouth Central Gardens.

The shopping streets are mostly pedestrianised and lined with a wide range of boutiques, stores, jewellers and accessory shops. There are modern shopping malls, Victorian arcades (including the Victorian Arcade between Westover Road and Old Christchurch Road), and a large selection of bars, clubs and cafÃ©s. About a mile to the west of the town centre, in the district of [[Westbourne, Dorset|Westbourne]], there is a selection of designer clothing and interior design shops. About a mile to the east, in the district of [[Boscombe]], there is another major shopping area including many antiques shops and a street market. North of the centre there is an out-of-town shopping complex called [[Castlepoint Shopping Centre]] with supermarkets, DIY stores and larger versions of high street shops. A new extension to Castlepoint, called Castlemore, is set just south west of the main complex, which features more large retail stores. Other supermarkets are located in the town centre ([[Asda]] and [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]]), Boscombe ([[Sainsbury's]]) and between Westbourne and Upper Parkstone. A large [[Tesco Extra]] store is located at the end of Castle Lane East, two miles east of Castlepoint.

===Festivals===
The town was a major centre for the 1951 [[Festival of Britain]] with classical concerts, opera, ballet and a visit from the [[Salzburg Marionette Theatre|Salzburg Marionettes]]; the two weeks in June also featured a national brass band competition, sea cadet displays and different sporting events.&lt;ref&gt;''The Festival of Britain'' (Official Book of the Festival of Britain 1951). HMSO, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bournemouth is currently host to several annual festivals. The town has had an annual literary festival since 2005. A [[Pride parade|Gay Pride festival]] named [[Bourne Free]] is held in the town each year during the summer.

Since 2008 Bournemouth has held its own [[Bournemouth Air Festival|air festival]] over four days in August. This has featured displays from the [[Red Arrows]] as well as appearances from the Yakovlevs, Blades, [[Wing walking|Team Guinot]] Wing-Walkers, [[Battle of Britain Memorial Flight]] including [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]], [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and also the last flying [[Avro Vulcan XH558|Vulcan]].

The air festival attracts nearly one million people over the four-day event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouthair.co.uk Bournemouth Air Show]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Main|List of schools in Bournemouth}}
The Bournemouth local education authority was first set up in 1903 and remained in existence until local government was [[Local Government Act 1972|reorganised in 1974]] when Bournemouth lost its [[County Borough]] status and became part of the county of Dorset. Under the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|later reforms of 1997]], Bournemouth became a [[unitary authority]] and the Bournemouth local education authority was re-established. Bournemouth is one of the minority of local authorities in England still to maintain [[selective education]], with two [[grammar school]]s (one for boys, one for girls) and eight [[Secondary modern school|secondary modern]]/[[Comprehensive school|comprehensive]] schools. There are also a small number of independent schools in the town, and a further education college.

[[Bournemouth University]] is one of the largest universities in the [[South of England]]. Known as Bournemouth Polytechnic between 1990 and 1992, it has its roots in the former Dorset Institute of Higher Education. It is one of the better-performing ex-polytechnics in England. The main campus is however in neighbouring [[Poole]]. [[The Arts University College at Bournemouth]], also officially in Poole, specialises in arts, design, media and performance degree courses. Bournemouth is also a major centre for the [[English language learning and teaching|teaching of English]] and has numerous English language schools. Many thousands of foreign students are attracted to the town every year, an important form of [[invisible trade]]. AECC Chiropractic College is also located in the Bournemouth area, which is the only chiropractic college in England. It is located in Boscombe, three miles from the town centre.

==Economy==
[[File:BournemouthEcho.jpg|thumb|right|The Offices of the [[Bournemouth Daily Echo]] newspaper, which serves the [[South East Dorset conurbation]].]]

Similarly to the rest of Dorset, Bournemouth's [[economy]] is primarily in the [[service sector]], which employed 93% of the workforce in 2007.&lt;ref name='economystats'&gt;[http://www.dorsetforyou.com/index.jsp?articleid=345037 Dorset For You]&lt;/ref&gt; This is 10% higher than the average employment in the service sector for [[Great Britain]] and the [[South West England|South West]].&lt;ref name='economystats' /&gt; The importance of the [[manufacturing sector]] has declined, and is predominantly based in neighbouring Poole, but still employs 3% of the workforce.&lt;ref name='economystats' /&gt; [[Tourism]] is crucial to the economy of Bournemouth, generating Â£440 million a year and employing thousands of workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourismoverview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/search/1502719.Economy_booming_thanks_to_tourism/ | title = Economy booming thanks to tourism | publisher = [[Bournemouth Daily Echo]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Business tourism]] alone contributed Â£127 million in 2007, through [[delegates]] and business visitors attending venues such as the [[BIC]] and exhibitions in the town.&lt;ref name='businesstourism'&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/search/2433532.Business_tourism___s___127m_contribution_to_local_economy/ Bournemouth Echo | title = Business tourismâs Â£127m contribution to local economy | publisher = [[Bournemouth Daily Echo]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='conurbationeconomy'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.burrows.co.uk/bournemouth/05TheM.htm | title = The Economy of the Conurbation | publisher = [[Burrows Communications Ltd]] | accessdate = 2009-02-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, Bournemouth was announced to be the first '[[Fibrecity]]' in the United Kingdom, with work starting in September to bring 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit [[Broadband internet access]] into homes and businesses within the town; running [[Optical fiber|fibre optic]] cables through the sewers reduces the cost and disruption to road networks during cable laying.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/4055310.First_connections_for_superfast_broadband/&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of the National Government's plans for everyone in the UK to have access to 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit Broadband by 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} A trial to the proposed 100&amp;nbsp;Mbit is scheduled to begin at the end of March 2009, where 30 homes will be connected for free. As the trial continues, all businesses and homes within BH10 and BH11 are entitled to sign up for free. As of February 2010, Fibrecity is connecting 4,000 homes and businesses a month in Bournemouth to the network and it is hoped that the town will be fully connected by the end of 2010.

==Transport==
===Road===
Bournemouth's road network is focused on a few main roads in and out of the town centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bournemouth's Roads, Travel, Transport &amp; Parking| publisher=Bournemouth Borough Council| month=August| year=2007| url=http://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/transport/| accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal route into the town centre is the [[A338 road|A338]] dual carriageway, which joins the [[A31 road|A31]], itself the major trunk road in central [[Southern England]], connecting to the [[M27 motorway|M27]] at [[Southampton]]. From here the [[M3 motorway|M3]] leads to London, and fast access may also be gained via the [[A34 road (England)|A34]] to the [[M4 motorway|M4]] north of [[Newbury, Berkshire]]. [[National Express]] coaches serve Bournemouth Travel Interchange &amp; Bournemouth University. There are frequent departures to London [[Victoria Coach Station]]. There are also direct services to the [[West Country]], [[Sussex]] coast ([[Brighton]] and [[Eastbourne]]), [[Bristol]], [[Birmingham]] and the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], the [[North West England|North West]], and to [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]]. Flightlink serves [[Heathrow Airport]] with connections to [[Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] Airports.

Local buses are provided mainly by two companies, [[Wilts &amp; Dorset]], the former [[National Bus Company]] subsidiary and now owned by the [[Go-Ahead]] group, and [[Yellow Buses]], the former Bournemouth Council-owned company and successors to Bournemouth Corporation Transport, which began operating trams in 1902. In 1969 the town became one of the last in England to discontinue [[Trolleybuses in Bournemouth|its trolleybus system]] and replace the [[trolleybus]]es with diesel buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Picture Gallery of Bournemouth's Trolleybuses|  first=David| last=Bradley|  url=http://www.trolleybus.net/bournemouth.htm| accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other operators serving the town include [[Shamrock Buses]], [[Damory Coaches]] (a subsidiary of Wilts &amp; Dorset), Shaftesbury &amp; District, Thompson's Travel and Verwood Buses.

===Rail===
[[File:Bournemouth railway station.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bournemouth railway station]], built in 1885, with a replica [[Victorian era|Victorian]] iron and glass roof.]]
Bournemouth is well served by the rail network with two stations in the town, [[Bournemouth railway station]] and [[Pokesdown railway station]] to the east. Parts of western Bournemouth can also be reached from [[Branksome railway station|Branksome]] station. Bournemouth railway station is located some way from the town centre, due to the town's early leaders not wishing to have a railway station within the town boundary, which extended {{convert|1|mi|km|sing=on}} from the pier.  However, the station is now well within the town, as the town has grown significantly since its founding.  The station was originally called Bournemouth East with a second station, [[Bournemouth West railway station|Bournemouth West]] serving the west of the town in Queen's Road. [[South West Trains]] operates a comprehensive service to [[Waterloo station|London Waterloo]] with a journey time of 1 hour 50 minutes. This line also serves [[Southampton]], [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] and [[Basingstoke]] to the east, and Poole, [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and Weymouth to the west. [[CrossCountry]] trains serve destinations to the north with direct trains to [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Oxford]], [[Birmingham]], [[Wolverhampton]] and [[Manchester]]. The North West, [[Yorkshire]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], Edinburgh and Glasgow can be reached by changing at Reading or [[Birmingham]]. [[West Coastway Line]] services are available by changing at [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton Central]]. The Sussex coastal towns of [[Chichester]], [[Worthing]], [[Hove]] and [[Brighton]] are served and trains continue to Gatwick Airport and London Victoria.

Besides its main line railway connections, Bournemouth is also the site of three [[funicular|funicular railways]], the [[East Cliff Railway]], [[West Cliff Railway]] and [[Fisherman's Walk Cliff Railway]]. These are all owned and operated by Bournemouth Borough Council, and each serves to link the seaside promenade with the cliff top, at various points along the seafront.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bournemouth's Cliff Railways | publisher = The Heritage Trail | url = http://www.theheritagetrail.co.uk/cliff_trams/bournemouth_railways.htm | accessdate = 2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
[[Bournemouth Airport]], in [[Hurn]] on the periphery of Bournemouth is a short journey from the town centre enabling passengers and freight to be flown directly to destinations in the UK and Europe. Taxis going to Bournemouth are available at the taxi stand on the airport and can transport one to the town centre in about 20â30 minutes. An hourly bus service also connects the airport with the town centre, travel interchange and also operates along the major hotel routes. [[Ryanair]], [[EasyJet]], [[Palmair]] and [[Thomson Airways]] provide scheduled services to destinations throughout Europe.

==Bournemouth Eye==
[[File:Bournemouth Eye.JPG|thumb|right|The Bournemouth Eye as seen from the ground.]]
The Bournemouth Eye is a local landmark, a helium-filled balloon attached to a [[steel]] [[cable]] in Bournemouth. It is a spherical helium-filled balloon with an enclosed gondola that carries up to 30 passengers. Tethered by a high tensile steel cable, the passenger gondola rises to a height of {{convert|390|ft|abbr=on}}, the maximum height allowed by the [[Civil Aviation Authority]]. This provides a panoramic view of the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bournemouthballoon.com/index.php?action=faq Bournemouth Eye Balloon Homepage] Frequently Asked Questions about the Bournemouth Eye&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
[[File:Dorset bournemouth from studland 02.jpg|thumb|Bournemouth seen from [[Studland]]]]
The Bournemouth area has long been a place where many unusual species of animals and plants can be found. [[Brownsea Island]], in nearby Poole Harbour, is one of the few places in the south where the [[red squirrel]] still remains, and the [[ant]] ''[[Formica pratensis]]'' had its last stronghold in the area, although it is now thought to be extinct on the mainland. Although described by [[Farren White]] as &quot;the common wood ant of Bournemouth&quot; in the mid-19th century, the noted [[entomologist]] [[Horace Donisthorpe]] found only one colony of true ''pratensis'' out of hundreds of [[Formica rufa|''F. rufa'']] nests there in 1906. In recent times the last known two colonies disappeared in the 1980s, making this ant the only ant species thought to have become extinct in [[Great Britain]]. It does, however, still survive on cliff-top locations in the [[Channel Islands]]. The rare [[narrow-headed ant]] also used to exist in Bournemouth, although it has died out in the area.

==Naming conventions==
The word 'Bournemouth' is often used loosely to describe the [[South East Dorset conurbation]], which also contains neighbouring towns [[Poole]], [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], [[Wimborne Minster]], [[Verwood]], [[Ringwood]] and [[New Milton]]. As a result, &quot;Bournemouth&quot; is used in the following terms:
*Although it has a significant presence in Bournemouth town centre, [[Bournemouth University]]'s main campus is located in Poole, on the boundary with Bournemouth
*[[Bournemouth Airport]] is located near [[Hurn]] in the borough of Christchurch, and was originally named RAF Hurn
*&quot;Bournemouth Bay&quot; is sometimes used for [[Poole Bay]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://www.bournemouth.co.uk/site/business/events-and-filming/bournemouth-bay-run-2010 Bournemouth Bay Run]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra]] is now based in Poole
