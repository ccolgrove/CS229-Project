The '''University of NebraskaâLincoln''' (commonly referred to as '''Nebraska''', '''UNL''' or '''NU''') is a [[public university|public]] research [[university]] located in the city of [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=181464|title=Carnegie Classifications - University of Nebraska|publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the state's oldest and largest university and the flagship university of the [[University of Nebraska system]].

The university was chartered by the legislature in 1869 as a [[land-grant university]] under the 1862 [[Morrill Act]], two years after Nebraska's statehood into the [[United States]]. Around the turn of the 20th century, the university began to expand significantly, hiring professors from [[East Coast of the United States|eastern]] schools to teach in the newly organized [[Professional schools|professional colleges]] while also producing groundbreaking research in agricultural sciences. The &quot;Nebraska method&quot; of ecological study developed here during this time, which pioneered grassland ecology and laid the foundation for research in [[theoretical ecology]] for the rest of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandervoort|first=Frances|year=1999|title=A Green Centennial|journal=The American Biology Teacher|publisher=University of California|volume=61|issue=9|pages=648â659|jstor=4450796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Merchant|first=Carolyn|title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bcdo0qlS0awC|accessdate=September 9, 2010|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=Manhattan, NY|isbn=9780231112338|pages=163Ã¢ÂÂ164|chapter=Chapter 9: The Rise of Ecology 1890-1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university is organized into eight colleges, located on two campuses in Lincoln with over 100 classroom buildings and research facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historicbuildings.unl.edu/overview.html|title=UNL Historic Buildings - Historical Overview|year=2005|publisher=University of NebraskaâLincoln|accessdate=5 September 2010|location=Lincoln, NE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its athletic program, called the [[Nebraska Cornhuskers|Cornhuskers]], is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. The UNL football team has won 46 conference championships and five [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]] since 1890. The women's volleyball team has won three [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|national championships]] along with eight other appearances in the [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|Final Four]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.huskers.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;KEY=&amp;SPID=23&amp;SPSID=18| title = Nebraska volleyball history | publisher = NU Athletics | accessdate = September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Husker football team plays its home games at [[Memorial Stadium, Lincoln|Memorial Stadium]], selling out every game since 1962. The stadium's current capacity is about 85,000 people, larger than the population of Nebraska's [[Bellevue, Nebraska|third-largest city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huskers.com//pdf5/40179.pdf?ATCLID=2722&amp;SPSID=8&amp;SPID=22&amp;DB_OEM_ID=100|title=Husker Football History|accessdate=2010-09-05|publisher=Huskers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&amp;ATCLID=734 | title=Memorial Stadium - Home of the Huskers | publisher=Huskers.com | year=2010 | accessdate=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin===
The University of Nebraska was created by an act of the [[Nebraska Legislature|Nebraska state legislature]] in 1869, two years after [[Nebraska]] reached statehood. The school was given a mission to &quot;afford to the inhabitants of the state the means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the various branches of literature, science, and the arts.&quot; The school received an initial land grant of about {{convert|130000|acre|ha}} and the campus construction began with the building of University Hall in its first year. By 1873, the University of Nebraska had offered its first two degrees to its first graduating class.&lt;ref&gt;Pound, Louise. ''Semi-centennial Anniversary Book.'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. 1919. pp. 11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The school remained small and suffered from a lack of funds until about 20 years after its founding, when its high school programs were taken over by a new state education system. From 1890 to 1895 enrollment rose from 384 to about 1,500. A law school and a graduate school were also created at about this time period, making it the first school west of the Mississippi to establish a graduate school.&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean that UNL was the first school west of the Mississippi to issue a graduate degree. That honor belongs to the [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. UNL was, however, the first school in the region to formally organize a school for graduates. [http://www.unl.edu/ucomm/chancllr/] [http://www.unl.edu/unlpub/bulletin_grad/downloads/gradbulletin0507.pdf] [http://www.asdu.ait.ac.th/NewsAndEvents/bulletinByIssue.cfm?Date=18-Jun-2002] [http://www.fulbrighter.org/file_depot/0-10000000/20000-30000/21647/folder/49307/FAST200510.html] [http://bulletin.unl.edu/graduate/General_Information][http://graduateschool.wustl.edu/welcom/history]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1897, the school was 15th in the nation in total enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;Luebke, Frederick. ''Nebraska: an Illustrated History.'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2005. pp.172-3 ISBN 0803280424&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the turn of the 20th century, the school struggled to find an identity as both a pragmatic, frontier establishment and an academic, intellectual institution.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, Robert. ''Prairie University.'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1995. pp. 38-39. ISBN 0803227175&lt;/ref&gt; It also developed a competitive spirit in the form of a debate team, a football team (first called the Cornhuskers in 1901), and the arrival of fraternities and sororities.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, Robert. ''Prairie University.'' Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1995. pp. 43-44 ISBN 0803227175&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913-14, a fierce debate ensued over whether to keep the University in downtown Lincoln or to move it out of town. The issue was not resolved until a statewide referendum sided with the downtown plan. After purchasing property downtown, the school experienced a building boom, both on the new property and on the farming campus. The school would not experience another boom until the late 1940s, when the sudden arrival of thousands of soldiers returning from the war for an education forced the school to seek further expansion.&lt;ref&gt;http://historicbuildings.unl.edu/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration and organization==
===Organizations===
====Governing bodies====
University of Nebraska is governed by the Board of Regents. The board consists of eight voting members elected by district for six-year terms, and four non-voting student Regents, one from each campus, who serve during their tenure as student body president. The board supervises the general operations of the university, and the control and direction of all expenditures.

====Faculties and schools====
The university today has nine faculties which offers more than 150 undergraduate majors, 20 pre-professional programs, 100 graduate programs and 275 programs of study&lt;ref name=org&gt;http://www.unl.edu/ucomm/depts/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Hamilton Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Hamilton Hall]]
In 1869, the original University of Nebraska campus was laid out on four city blocks and comprised one building called University Hall. Currently, the university has two campuses, totalling {{convert|2815|acre|ha}}: City Campus, which is just north of downtown Lincoln, and south of the old [[Nebraska State Fair]] grounds and East Campus which is approximately two miles east-northeast of City Campus. Both the campus has an institute area, as well as a residential area. The institute area, consist of the departments, headquarters, governing body, research institutes, well equipped laboratories, theaters, auditoriums, recreation centers, fraternity and sorority housing, power plants, facilities and managements. Institute area occupies {{convert|613|acre|ha}} combining both the campuses. However the larger part is the residential district, which consist of student housing, residential apartments, and on campus living for faculties in apartments or individual cottages. Water supply management located in the residential district, supplies water throughout the campus. Remote sensing located in East campus,rail management factory in city campus, and some other remote research centers on telecommunications and wireless technology are also located in residential districts of the campus. Parks and recreation places inside the UNL city campus and East campus is a part of the residential area of the university. Other than the two main campuses, UNL also secures the honor of having UNL technology park located off campus, toward the northern side of Lincoln, at the Superior Street. The park covers an area of {{convert|25|acre|ha}}. It is supplied by some modern high tech laboratories on artificial intelligence.Nebraska Technology Park is the first endeavor of its kind in the state. The Technology Park was launched in 1997 as a joint effort of the University of Nebraska, private sector investors and the University of Nebraska Foundation. The purpose of the Technology Park is to promote synergies between the university and park companies in order to increase joint efforts in collaboration, discovery, and technology development.

===Major campus expansion===
In January 2010, the university acquired a {{convert|249|acre|ha|adj=on}} property north of city campus that formerly was used to host the Nebraska State Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://innovate.unl.edu/overview_vision.shtml|title=University of Nebraska Innovation Campus: Overview and Vision|accessdate=2011-08-02|publisher=unl.edu/overview_vision.shtml.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for redevelopment include an [[United States Dollar|US $]]800 [[1000000 (number)|million]] expansion called the [[Nebraska Innovation Campus]], which is designated to house agricultural biotechnology and other life science research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journalstar.com/news/local/education/article_00bde850-d5f8-11de-bfe2-001cc4c002e0.html|title=University of Nebraska Board of Regents approve Innovation Campus|accessdate=2011-08-02|publisher=JounralStar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newsroom.unl.edu/releases/2008/07/11/Nebraska+Innovation+Campus+ideas,++approaches+sought|title=Nebraska Innovation Campus|accessdate=2011-08-02|publisher=University of NebraskaâLincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unions===
[[Image:Nebraska Union.jpg|thumb|right|Nebraska Union]]

The Howell Theatre, Studio Theatre, and Lab Theatre are home to the performances of the Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film.

===Other points of interest===
* Architecture Hall, formerly the universities' library and now home of the universities' outstanding architecture program, is a proud landmark standing on the west edge of campus. It is also the oldest building on campus. This historic structure is linked to the old law building via a huge glass connecting space, known, understandably, as &quot;The Link.&quot;

* Since the early 1920s UNL has been the home of the Headquarters of the National Society of [[Pershing Rifles]] a military fraternal organization for college-level students. This is in recognition of General [[John J. Pershing]] (an 1893 NU law school graduate and former professor of Military Science and Tactics) who created &quot;Company A,&quot; a competitive drill team, for the University of Nebraska's Cadet Corps in 1891. The drill team won the National Competitive Drills in 1892, changed its name to the &quot;Varsity Rifles&quot; when it became a recognized fraternal organization in 1893, and finally changed its name again to the &quot;Pershing Rifles&quot; in 1894. UNL rededicated the Military and Naval Science Building as the John J. Pershing Military and Naval Science Building on April 20, 2006.

* The [[International Quilt Study Center]] is on East Campus and will be [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified.

===Focus areas===
The University's English Department has one of the world's top programs in the [[digital humanities]], with renowned digital archiving projects such as the [[Walt Whitman]] Archive and the [[Willa Cather]] Archive. Projects are also underway for the production of a free online Native American [[Omaha-Ponca language]] dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;http://stories.nufoundation.org/node/467&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of [[creative writing]], the department has as a member of its faculty former [[United States Poet Laureate]], [[Ted Kooser]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanlifeinpoetry.org/kooser.html&lt;/ref&gt; The school's [[University of Nebraska Press]] is the second-largest public university press in the United States, and is among the largest publishers of scholarly titles in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;nufoundation.org&quot;&gt;http://www.nufoundation.org/Shop//showDivision.sp?cat=87&lt;/ref&gt;

===AAU membership and removal===
In 1908, Nebraska was inducted as the 18th member of the [[Association of American Universities]], the organization of the nation's top research universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Knoll1995&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Knoll|first=Robert E.|title=Prairie University: a History of the University of Nebraska|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QtVFWVTRDGIC|accessdate=6 September 2010|date=1995-08-01|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|location=Lincoln|isbn=978-0803227170|pages=47â54|chapter=The Pattern of the Modern University}}  [http://books.google.com/books?id=QtVFWVTRDGIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=AAU&amp;pg=PA48 Excerpt available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, Nebraska had been at or near the bottom of the AAU's statistical criteria for members, a ranking attributed in part to the university's extensive agricultural research funded by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]], which is not included in the AAU's rankings because it is not awarded by peer-reviewed grants; and because Nebraska's [[University of Nebraska Medical Center|medical school]] is a separate institution whose research funding is not under UNL's auspices.  

Nebraska successfully retained its AAU membership after a 2000 challenge.  This provided Nebraska with an advantage when the [[Big Ten]] was looking to expand in 2010, as all of its members at that time were AAU members. Nebraska Chancellor Harvey Perlman said. &quot;I doubt that our application would've been accepted had we not been a member of the [AAU].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-13/sports/ct-spt-0614-aau-big-ten-expansion--20100613_1_aau-nebraska-chancellor-harvey-perlman-big-ten-members | work=Chicago Tribune | first=Chris | last=Hine | title=Nebraska has it all to attract Big Ten, most importantly AAU membership | date=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, after an extended campaign to retain its membership and a close, contentious vote, Nebraska became the only institution to be removed from the AAU membership by a vote of the membership (a few other institutions had voluntarily resigned.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kevin | last = Abourezk | title = Research universities group ends UNL's membership | date = 2011-04-29 | url = http://journalstar.com/news/local/education/article_d9eca939-b681-535d-ad1a-a98d9ef3b01e.html?utm_campaign=ljtweet&amp;utm_source=ljtweet&amp;utm_medium=ljtweet | work = [[Lincoln Journal Star]] | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Leslie | last = Reed | title = Academic group drops UNL | date = 2011-04-30 | url = http://www.omaha.com/article/20110429/NEWS01/110428852/1006415 | work = [[Omaha World-Herald]] | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Tamar | last = Lewin | title = American Universities Group Votes to Expel Nebraska | date = 2011-05-02 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/education/03aau.html | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jeffrey J. | last = Selingo | coauthors = Jack Stripling | title = Nebraska's Ouster Opens a Painful Debate Within the AAU | date = 2011-05-02 | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Ouster-Opens-a-Painful-Debate/127364/ | work = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
