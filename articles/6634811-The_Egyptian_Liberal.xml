'''Human rights in Islamic countries''' vary greatly. In some parts of the [[Muslim world]], there is little respect for [[human right]]s, whilst other countries treat the issue with more importance.

==Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam==
{{main|Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam}}

Some [[List of Muslim majority countries|countries with majority Muslim populations]] have tried to introduce the concept of Islamic human rights. The [[Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam]] (CDHRI), adopted by the member states of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] in 1990, provides an overview on the Islamic perspective on human rights, and affirms Islamic law ([[Shari'ah]]) as its sole source. CDHRI declares its purpose to be &quot;general guidance for Member States [of the OIC] in the Field of human rights&quot;. This declaration is usually seen as an Islamic response to the post-World War II [[United Nations]]â [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) of 1948. However, even these more limited rights are mostly ignored or patchily implemented. In particular, the Cairo Declaration does little to assure the rights of [[religious minority|religious minorities]] in Islamic dominated countries. Changing religion to leave Islam is defined as [[apostasy]] and may be punished severely.

==Saudi Arabia==

The human rights situation in [[Saudi Arabia]] is considered to be very poor. Saudi Arabia is an [[absolute monarchy]] which is ruled by the [[House of Saud]]. Saudi Arabia is a center for [[Islamic fundamentalism]] and the [[Wahabi]] [[sect]] institutes the practice of [[Sharia law]] which involves the use of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/doc?t=mideast&amp;c=saudia Human Rights Watch: Middle East and Northern Africa : Saudi Arabia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public execution]]s are held regularly and involve [[decapitation]], [[firing squad]]s, and [[stoning]]. Women and men who commit [[adultery]] are stoned to death {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Women are forced conceal their body in public, be escorted by a man in public and are not allowed to drive.

==Pakistan==

The human rights situation in [[Pakistan]] is generally regarded as poor by domestic and international observers. Pakistan is a center of [[Islamic fundamentalism]]. The human rights record of Pakistan was particularly grave under the dictatorship of the US-supported [[General Zia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/9da54d3f22f184f1802567390039e0d6?Opendocument Joint written statement submitted by&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; General Zia introduced [[Sharia Law]] which led to [[Islam]]ization of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/pakistan/mckenna_pakistan.html CBC News In Depth: Pakistan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The current regime in Pakistan has been responsible for [[torture]], [[extrajudicial killing|extrajudicial executions]] and other [[human rights violations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/countries/pakistan/index.do Pakistan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Honor killing]]s are also common in Pakistan.

[[Turkey]] is the one of the only two countries with a majority Muslim population to have a [[secular democracy]]. Turkey has been harshly criticized for its human rights record which has kept it from joining the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/europe/turkey.php Human Rights Watch: Europe and Central Asia : Turkey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Great damage was done to Turkish attempts to join the European Union when Turkish author [[Orhan Parmuk]] was arrested and put on trial for speaking to a [[Swiss]] newspaper about his belief that Turkey should take responsibility for the murder of 1.5 million [[Armenians]] and 30,000 [[Kurds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4205708.stm BBC NEWS | Europe | Turk 'genocide' author faces jail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/oct2005/turk-o08.shtml Turkey: trampling on free speech continues Novelist Orhan Pamuk faces jail terms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally released after intense international pressure.

The human rights situation in the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] is considered to be poor.
