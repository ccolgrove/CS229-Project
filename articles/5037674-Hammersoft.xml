Founded in 1912, it covers an area of about {{convert|25000|m2|sqft}}. Hundreds of films, including [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]'' and [[Josef von Sternberg]]'s ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' were filmed there. In 2012 Studio Babelsberg will celebrate its 100th anniversary.

Today, Studio Babelsberg remains operational mainly for feature film productions. Furthermore, it acts as co-producer on international high budget productions.

== History ==
[[Image:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|Entrance to the studios]]

In 1911, the company Bioscop built its first glassâfilm studio in Neubabelsberg. The first filming began as early as February 1912 for ''The Dance of the Dead'' by Danish director Urban Gad. In 1922 the Deutsche Bioscop Gesellschaft merged with [[Erich Pommer]]'s Decla-Film GmbH into âDecla Bioscopâ. In 1921, Decla Bioscop passed into [[Universum Film AG]] (Ufa) which had been founded in 1917. This company built the large studio (which is now known as the &quot;Marlene Dietrich Halle&quot;) in 1926 for the major film production of ''Metropolis'' by [[Fritz Lang]]. The first German sound stage in Babelsberg, the Tonkreuz, was built during 1929. ''Melodie des Herzens/Melody of the Heart'' with [[Willy Fritsch]] was the first German full-sound film. This was followed in 1930 by the premiere of ''[[Der blaue Engel|The Blue Angel]]'' by [[Josef von Sternberg]] with [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Emil Jannings]] in the main roles.  

From 1933 to 1945, around 1,000 feature films were made in the studios and on the studio lot. Under the direction of Hitler's propaganda chief [[Joseph Goebbels]], the studio churned out hundreds of films including [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s openly propagandistic ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. The virally anti-Semitic propaganda film ''[[Jud SÃ¼Ã (1940 film)|Jud SÃ¼ss]] (The Jew SÃ¼ss)'', shot in 1940, was also made at Babelsberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,504072,00.html Spiegel, 09/06/07]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 1946, the [[DEFA]] - Deutsche Film AG - was established. It produced over 800 feature films, including 150 children's films. In addition, over 600 films were made for television from 1959 to 1990. The DEFA period was honored by a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art ([[MOMA]]) in [[New York]] in 2005.

After the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], the [[Treuhand]] took over the responsibility for the privatisation of the former DEFA. In August 1992, the Treuhandanstalt sold the former [[DEFA]] film studios in Babelsberg to the French group Compagnie GÃ©nÃ©rale des Eaux (later absorbed into [[Vivendi Universal]]). Over the following 12 years the company invested around â¬500 million updating the studio's infrastructure.

In July 2004, Vivendi sold Studio Babelsberg to the investment company FBB (Filmbetriebe Berlin Brandenburg GmbH), which has [[Carl Woebcken]] and [[Christoph Fisser]] as shareholders. In Spring of 2005, the restructured studio presented an initial public offering and began trading on the free market. 

2007 was the most profitable year since the Studio's privatization in 1992 - 12 feature films were shot at Studio Babelsberg, among them ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' with [[Tom Cruise]], ''[[The International]]'' with [[Clive Owen]], and ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]'' with [[Kate Winslet]].

In 2008 Studio Babelsberg and Hollywood producer [[Joel Silver]] formed a strategic alliance to produce feature films from the Dark Castle production slate at the worldâs oldest film studio.

Recent co-productions of Studio Babelsberg include [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (released 2009) and [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[The Ghost Writer (film)|The Ghost Writer]]'' (2010).
