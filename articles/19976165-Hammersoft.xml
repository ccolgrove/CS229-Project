== Biography ==
In 2006, a new project, &quot;Mind Over Body&quot; was released and conceived as a &quot;Flow of Consciousnes&quot;. 

Since 2004, MindFlow have completed two European tours, one in [[Asia]], and another in [[North America]]. They have made appearances at many festivals such as the 2nd Duryu Rock and Sports Festival in [[South Korea]]. In [[Spain]], the group appeared at the Prog Metal Fest, a multi-venue festival that visited four cities: [[Madrid]], [[Palencia]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Girona]]. Still on the European scene, MindFlow played at the Metal Heart Festival in [[Norway]], at the Cambridge Rock Festival in [[England]] and performed at a show in [[Belgium]], Spirit of 66. In the [[United States]] alone, they have performed in 10 more shows, including the Monsters of Rock; the Texas Mad Festival; and the Blastzone Festival. In Brazil, the group has appeared all over the country, at such events as the Live'N'Louder Rock Fest 2006, at the Skol Area, Anhembi, SÃ£o Paulo - Latin America's biggest rock festival - and have already played in the stages of some Brazilian venues such as the Directv Music Hall (now the Citibank Music Hall), the Via Funchal and the Victoria Hall.

Their third album ''Destructive Device'' was produced by [[Ben Grosse]] (Marilyn Mason, Slipknot, Disturbed, Breaking Benjamin, Sevendust) and was recorded and mixed both in Brazil and [[Los Angeles]]. Grosse recorded parts of the album (specifically the bass, drums and keyboards) at &quot;Mosh Studios&quot; in SÃ£o Paulo, and moved the project to &quot;The Mix Room&quot; in Los Angeles where the vocals, guitar and mixing were completed.

Mindflow has recently announced a new album, titled ''365''.

== GAME Follow Your Instinct ==
&quot;Follow Your Instinct&quot; is an [[ARG]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.argn.com/2009/02/you_dont_know_jack/ Article of the game Follow Your Instinct]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Alternate Reality Game]]) created by the band MindFlow. The game situates the participants as detectives in a pursue of a dangerous [[serial killer]].

ARG is a type of game that combines fictional situations with reality, making use of media channels from the real world. &quot;Follow Your Instinct&quot; takes place in websites, e-mails, phone calls, and among other media sources.

More than 3,000 people participated in the first edition of &quot;Follow Your Instinct&quot; that lasted 1 year and 3 months. The clues were all over the place from musical passages, emails, websites, mysterious recordings, photos and especially in a comic booklet that came with the disc of the band.

In its album ''Destructive Device'' MindFlowâs saga continues with: FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCT 2.0 â J.A.C.K. The new website of the band has become an Intelligence Agency and the disc is now the portfolio of evidence of new crimes of the serial killer including a poster for the start of the investigation.
