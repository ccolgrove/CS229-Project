The '''HTC Incredible S''' (S710E) is a smartphone designed and manufactured by Taiwan's [[HTC|HTC Corporation]] that runs the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.2 Froyo operating system (Upgradable to 2.3). Officially announced by HTC on February 15, 2011
&lt;ref name=HTCPressRelease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.htc.com/us/press/htc-launches-three-new-smartphones-with-htc-sensetrade/29|accessdate=April 13, 2011|title=HTC LAUNCHES THREE NEW SMARTPHONES WITH HTC SENSEâ¢|publisher=[[HTC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; at MWC 2011 in [[Barcelona]], Spain alongside the [[HTC Desire S]] and the [[HTC Wildfire S]], the HTC Incredible S was launched exclusively in the UK to [[Carphone Warehouse]] &amp; [[Best Buy]] on February 26, 2011&lt;ref name=exclusiveCWBB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressoffice.carphonewarehouse.com/news/item/the_incredible_s_the_incredible_sarah_harding/?phpMyAdmin=AHBslJMinbQ440hrdN48U9K1ZO9|accessdate=April 13, 2011|title=THE INCREDIBLE Sâ¦ THE INCREDIBLE SARAH HARDING|publisher=[[Carphone Warehouse]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketed by [[Sarah Harding]] of [[Girls Aloud]].&lt;ref name=exclusiveCWBB /&gt;

The Incredible S is the successor to the [[Droid Incredible]].

== History ==
=== Development ===
During development, the device was codenamed '''''Vivo''''' and little was known about it before release. It is available as a [[CDMA]] variant on the US network [[Verizon]] as of May 2011&lt;ref name=incredible2April&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-20048872-251.html?tag=mncol;txt|accessdate=April 13, 2011|title=Verizon's spring plans confirm Android details|publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name ''Droid Incredible 2'',&lt;ref name=incredible2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19736_7-20052850-251.html|accessdate=April 13, 2011|title=Final Droid Incredible 2 details coming into focus|publisher=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a world phone able to access both GSM and CDMA networks.&lt;ref name=incredible2 /&gt;

== Hardware ==
[[File:HTC Incredible S - back.jpg|thumb|left|Backside]]
The HTC Incredible S is the latest of a long line of smartphones based around the 1&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)|Snapdragon]] chipset made by [[Qualcomm]]. In terms of hardware, it is very similar to the [[Desire HD]] with a few notable differences:

* Smaller screen: 4.0&quot; compared to 4.3&quot;&lt;ref name=DHDSpecs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.htc.com/www/product/desirehd/specification.html|accessdate=April 13, 2011|title=HTC Desire HD Specifications|publisher=[[HTC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Larger Battery: 1,450 mAh compared to 1230mAh&lt;ref name=DHDSpecs /&gt;
* S-LCD screen is greatly improved in clarity and brightness
* Addition of a 1.3MP fixed-focus front-facing camera for video calling

In a move seen as a new trend for HTC, the antenna for the phone is built into the back cover of the case (this is also true of the [[HTC Sensation]]). A unique feature of the Incredible S is the auto-rotating nature of the capacitive buttons below the screen.&lt;ref name=autoRotate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/02/18/htc-incredible-s-auto-rotating-buttons-explained-video/|accessdate=April 13, 2011|title=HTC Incredible S auto-rotating buttons explained?|publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite HTC recent design trend, the back is made of a rubberised plastic instead an [[aluminium]] uni-body, presumably to help improve signal reception. The front is mainly covered by a sheet of [[gorilla glass]], with a thin aluminium surround. In addition to the specification already mentioned, the Incredible S houses dual microphones for noise cancellation.

=== Regional Variations ===
The version that has been made available in Canada for reviewers has been seen to have chrome accents around the screen, speaker grill, camera lens, LED flash bulbs and loudspeaker which the European and Asian version do not have.&lt;ref name=chromeAccents&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howardforums.com/content.php/488-HTC-Incredible-S-Review|accessdate=April 13, 2011|title=HTC Incredible S Review|publisher=[[HowardForums]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A red version is in production and has been spotted in Hong Kong and Singapore.&lt;ref name=redIS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartone-vodafone.com/jsp/phone/english/detail_v3.jsp?id=1534|accessdate=May 5, 2011|title=HTC Incredible S Phone Details|publisher=[[SmarTone Mobile Communications Limited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 24, 2011, the HTC Droid Incredible has been available in a limited edition red color, instead of the usual black.

== Software ==
HTC have announced that the device will be upgradable to the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.3 &quot;Gingerbread&quot; in Q2 2011.&lt;ref name=GBUpgrade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/HTC-Android-2-3-for-Desire-Desire-HD-Desire-Z-Incredible-S-in-Spring-186457.shtml|accessdate=April 13, 2011|title=HTC: Android 2.3 for Desire, Desire HD, Desire Z, Incredible S in Spring|publisher=[[Softpedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was shipped with the second version of HTC's Sense, which includes [[satellite navigation]] software developed by [[TomTom]] using maps from [[Route66]] (30 day free trial included) and a digital bookstore from [[Kobo]] fully integrated into the system. For the UK release, the UK &amp; Northern Ireland maps are pre-loaded onto the bundled 8 GB [[microSD]] card. The device is a part of the new generation of HTC phones that have a signed bootloader. As a consequence, the phone cannot be easily [[rooted]], and the user is denied administrative rights to the phone.&lt;ref name=LockedBootloader&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.gsmarena.com/htc-incredible-s-has-a-signed-bootloader-and-recovery-will-htc-phones-become-less-custom-rom-friendly/|accessdate=May 24, 2011|title=HTC Incredible S has a signed bootloader and recovery, will HTC phones become less custom ROM friendly?|publisher=[[gsmarena]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, users have achieved root despite the signed bootloader.
