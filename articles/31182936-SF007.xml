'''SoftAP''' is short for Software enabled Access Point. While a [[Wireless Access Point]] (WAP) is specifically made only to work as an Access Point, SoftAP is used to make a wireless client antenna work as both the Access Point and client.

==How it works==
This &quot;virtual&quot; [[Wi-Fi]] feature is enabled by software working on the device to create a [[wireless hotspot]] or portable [[hotspot]] that other wireless devices in the vicinity can use. 

The advantage of SoftAP is the use of a regular cellphone, for example, with a client antenna and data connection as an Access Point to serve other wireless devices which do not have a data connection otherwise. The wireless devices in the vicinity of the SoftAP enabled device, which may not have the [[Internet]] access directly, can use the Internet through the cellphone whose SoftAP is enabled. This is called [[tethering.]]

==Platform Support==
Various [[operating system]] platforms support SoftAP currently. Some of the operating systems which are know to support SoftAP are:

* [[Linux]]
* [[Windows 7]]
* [[Android (operating system)|Android]]
* [[Windows Phone 7.5]]
