The '''Alsancak Terminal''' ({{lang-tr|Alsancak GarÄ±}}) or '''Alsancak Railway Station''' in [[Ä°zmir]] is the second-oldest train station in [[Turkey]], after the [[Kemer Railway Station]] (also in Ä°zmir), being completed in 1858.&lt;ref name=Omer&gt;[http://web.deu.edu.tr/berent/tren/omer/omer_alsancak.html History of Alsancak Station] - By Ãmer Tolga SÃ¼merli&lt;/ref&gt; The station houses the headquarters of [[TCDD District 3]] and is the largest station in Turkey by size. Alsancak station is one of the busiest stations in Turkey. The station was electrified in 2001, with [[25 kV AC]] overhead wire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/History/TCDD#toc9 TCDD Electrification] - Trains and Railways of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intercity rail|intercity]] trains to [[Ankara]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=495 Karesi Ekspresi] - TCDD Anahat trenleri&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=495 Ä°zmir Mavi Tren] - TCDD Anahat trenleri&lt;/ref&gt; [[BandÄ±rma]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=495 6 EylÃ¼l SÃ¼per Ekspresi] - TCDD Anahat trenleri&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=495 17 EylÃ¼l Ekspresi] - TCDD Anahat trenleri&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afyon]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/home/detail/?id=495 Ege Ekspresi] - TCDD Anahat trenleri&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UÅak]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdd.gov.tr/Upload/Files/ContentFiles/2010/bolgesel/basmaneafyon.htm UÅak BÃ¶lgesel Ekspresi]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Commuter rail|commuter]] trains to [[Menderes]], [[ÃiÄli]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izban.com.tr/Sayfalar/Single.aspx?Page=33 Ä°ZBAN saatleri]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AliaÄa]] service the station.

==History==
[[Ä°zmir]] was a primary trade city during the 19th century and still is today. The main industry of the area was agriculture. However it took caravans days to transport the goods from the fields to the port. So, the [[Ottoman Empire]] gave a concession to a British company to build a railway from [[AydÄ±n]] to Ä°zmir, on September 22, 1856.&lt;ref name=ORC&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/History/ORC ORC History] - Trains &amp; Railways of Turkey&lt;/ref&gt; The '''[[Oriental Railway Company]]''' (ORC) was formed on that day.

===Ottoman Era 1856-1920===
The Oriental Railway Company chose to start their line in the neighborhood of [[Alsancak]], near the docks. The original station consisted of a small building with a few tracks and a small depot. The station opened on October 30, 1858, when the railway reached [[Gaziemir]] and SeydikÃ¶y. Passenger traffic was low and the few freight trains that operated, unloaded at [[Kemer Railway Station|Kemer]]. The railway reached AydÄ±n in 1866 and the ORC opened the whole line on July 1, 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;ORC&quot;/&gt; When this line opened, freight traffic was too heavy for Kemer to handle and the ORC needed a larger depot. More tracks were added, maintenance depots, train sheds and freight depots were built as well as the Alsancak dock being considerably extended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Omer&quot;/&gt; Also allot of rich foreign and Ottoman business leviathans lived in Ä°zmir, mainly in Bornova, Åirinyer and Buca. The railway could help them commute to work in Alsancak and back to their homes. Passenger traffic increased once the Åirinyer-Buca branch was opened, in 1870 and a new station was needed to built for these rich families. In 1871 a new, bigger station with a clock tower was opened. This clock tower became the first in Ä°zmir. Today, this building is the headquarters of [[TCDD District 3|District 3]].

In 1890s, a tram line was opened from the dock in Pasaport to Alsancak station, traveling up the Kordon waterfront. This line was connected to the tracks at the station and passengers would board horse-pulled trams from Pasaport to Alsancak station to board intercity trains in the day. At night freight trains would transport freight to Pasaport pier, to reduce the congestion in the port of Alsancak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Omer&quot;/&gt; With the opening of this tram line traffic increased even more and the existing freight depots were moved to the Alsancak docks.

The railway also changed the economy of Ä°zmir completely. In the early 1900s, gas lamps were added to the city streets to replace the ones that operated with coal. With this, a power plant was added next to the station and tracks were extended through the station to the docks. The Ottoman Empire sided with [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[German Empire]]. During the war the Oriental Railway Company was taken from the English and operated by the Ottoman government. The Ottoman Empire eventually lost the war in 1920 and the Allies started to occupy [[Anatolia]]. The railway still operated but traffic decreased greatly. The station was miraculously unharmed during the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] in 1922. Control of the line was handed back to the ORC on November 6, 1922, when the Ottoman Empire officially collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ORC&quot;/&gt;

===Turkish Republic Era 1923-Present===
The Allied forces eventually left Anatolia after the [[Turkish Independence War]] and the [[Turkish Republic]] formed. The Oriental Railway Company continued to operate under its concession by the Ottoman Empire. Traffic increased steadily and a new locomotive shed was built in 1923. In 1927 a railway museum opened in the station. Once the concession ended in 1935, the [[Turkish State Railways]] (1927) agreed to buy the ORC for Â£1,825,840. On June 1, 1935, the State Railways absorbed the ORC. 

Traffic greatly increased in 1938, when the State Railways started daily service to [[Ankara]]. With this increase, a train shed was built over the platforms and the present day station was built. In the early 1950s, the tracks leading to the port were taken up and a new spur was built near HalkapÄ±nar. Alsancak became a &quot;gateway to the south&quot; in the 1970s, as trains departing from Alsancak all headed south of Ä°zmir. Between 2000-2001 the State Railways built several more platforms and electrified the tracks, to bring commuter rail to Ä°zmir. The overhead wires were never used and on July 23, 2006, the station was closed to passenger service for the renovation of the surrounding lines. Between late 2006 and early 2010, Alsancak station was at an all time low. No trains served the station until the construction of KarÅÄ±yaka tunnel was completed. On May 25, 2010, long distance passenger service returned. Alsancak was also chosen to be the headquarters and main hub of Ä°zmir's new commuter rail system: [[Ä°ZBAN]]. Ä°ZBAN started operation from Alsancak to CumaovasÄ± on August 30, 2010, Alsancak-ÃiÄli on December 5, 2010 and Alsancak-AliaÄa on January 31, 2011.

==Layout==
[[File:Ä°ZBAN trains at Alsancak Station.JPG|thumb|200px|An Ä°ZBAN commuter train heading to the CumaovasÄ± district.]]
Alsancak station has a unique layout, compared to other stations in Turkey. Tracks 1 and 4 are used for intercity and regional trains (track 1 for departures, track 4 for arrivals). Tracks 2 and 3 are used as a siding. Tracks 7-9 are used for commuter rail to CumaovasÄ±, ÃiÄli and AliaÄa. Tracks 5, 6 and 10 are currently used as a siding for trains. Alsancak has a main staffed station building,built in 1938, with a ticket and information booth. The 1871 clock tower station is now the headquarters for District 3. The depots behind the clock tower station are used for storing switchers and railcars. The headquarters of Ä°ZBAN are in a new building, built in 2002, next to the commuter rail platforms.

==Media==
Alsancak has always been a landmark of Ä°zmir. Many films and television shows were filmed in the station. During the 4 years that it was closed to passenger service, [[Nil Karaibrahimgil]] and [[SÄ±la GenÃ§oÄlu]] performed on the platforms.
