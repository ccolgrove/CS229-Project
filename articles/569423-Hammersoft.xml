'''GLV''' and '''BCV''', better known collectively as '''[[Southern Cross Ten|Southern Cross Ten Victoria]]''', are television stations in regional [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]].

==History==
===Early years===
GLV-10 in Traralgon was the first regional television station to launch in Australia, on 9 December 1961, originally covering the [[Gippsland]] and [[Latrobe Valley]] areas. It was also the first station to use entirely Australian-made broadcasting equipment from ''Amalgamated Wireless Australasia''. The original transmission equipment consisted of a 10&amp;nbsp;kW and 2&amp;nbsp;kW transmitter (standby) which was based on the RCA product and adapted to 230V 50&amp;nbsp;Hz by AWA. The Melbourne pickup was a Rhode and Schwarz off air receiver with AWA return microwave links to the Studio. BCV-8 followed two weeks later on 23 December 1961 (the same day as the launch of [[GMV-6]] [[Shepparton, Victoria|Shepparton]]), serving [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]] and central Victoria.

===Affiliations===
GLV pioneered the use of live, 'off-air' relays of television programs from stations in [[Melbourne]], including [[GTV-9]]'s hugely-popular ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]''. Since the station had no video recording equipment, engineers were forced to rely on picking up the original signal at the transmitter site to relay back to the studio. As the sole commercial television station in the region, GLV's program lineup included local output such as news and children's programs, combined with programs selected from Melbourne's commercial stations - the [[Seven Network]] ([[HSV-7]]), [[Nine Network]] (GTV-9) and from 1964, [[Network Ten]] ([[ATV-0]], later ATV-10).

An affiliation was formed between the two stations and [[STV-8]] [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]] in the 1970s. A common name, logo, and programming schedule followed in 1982, with the establishment of the ''TV8'' network between the three stations, changed to the ''Southern Cross Network'' seven years later. STV-8 was split from the network in 1990 when the station joined the then-''VIC Television'' network.

===From GLV-10 to GLV-8===
In January 1980, GLV-10 changed frequency from VHF channel 10 to 8, becoming ''GLV-8'' to allow neighbouring [[Melbourne]] television station [[ATV-10|ATV-0]] to move to the channel 10 frequency.

===Aggregation===
When [[Regional television in Australia#Aggregation|aggregation]] in regional Victoria took place between 1992 and 1993, the Southern Cross Network expanded to [[Shepparton]], [[Ballarat]] and [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] as an affiliate of [[Network Ten]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} By September 1993, the network had changed its name and logo to ''SCN'', and then again in May 1994 to ''Ten Victoria''. This latest change coincided with the axing of the station's local news service, replaced by [[ATV (TV station)|ATV-10]]'s ''[[Ten News#Melbourne|Eyewitness News]]''.

===21st century developments===
In 2000, GLV-8 moved again to [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 37, in order to allow another [[Melbourne]] station, this time [[GTV-9]] to commence [[digital terrestrial television in Australia|digital television]] transmissions without interference.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The two stations' playout and management operations were moved from Bendigo to [[Canberra]] in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Programming==
===News and Current Affairs===

From their inception, regional stations GLV and BCV provided local news bulletins within their respective markets.  This was usually supplemented by a relay of one of the Melbourne-based bulletins.

During the 1980s, GLV/BCV branded their evening news block as ''Newshour'', comprising half an hour of locally-based news and half an hour of news from Melbourne channel [[HSV-7]].  In April 1987, the Melbourne-based news became sourced from [[GTV-9]] as HSV-7 had changed its news format to a one-hour bulletin.

In 1986, ''Newshour'' won a [[Logie Awards of 1986|Logie award]] for Most Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Television Station.

In 1991, GLV/BCV changed its Melbourne-based news relay to ''Ten Eyewitness News'' from [[ATV-10]], in the lead-up to the aggregation of regional markets which would see GLV/BCV align with the [[Network Ten|Ten Network]] for program material.

In January 1992, following aggregation, GLV/BCV maintained its local half-hour news in its traditional markets of Gippsland and Bendigo.  (Alternative general entertainment programming was broadcast in this timeslot in the newer markets of Shepparton, Ballarat and Albury) This bulletin was supplemented by a half-hour edition of ''Southern Cross Eyewitness News'', anchored by [[Rob Gaylard]] and broadcast across the expanded market covered by GLV/BCV, presenting 'national' news of relevance to the broader market.

''Southern Cross Eyewitness News'' was soon disbanded, instead having the Gippsland and Bendigo local news services at 6.00pm supplemented by the Melbourne-based ''Ten Eyewitness News'', from ATV-10, which aired weeknights at 5.00pm.

In September 1993, Southern Cross Network became '''SCN'''.  The news programming block was changed again.  Relay of the Melbourne-based ''Ten Eyewitness News'' was dropped, with the Bendigo edition of local news - ''SCN Local News'' - expanded to cover the local markets of Shepparton and Ballarat.  The Gippsland-based edition of ''SCN Local News'' continued to cover that local region only.  At 6.30pm, GLV/BCV re-instated the statewide ''Eyewitness News'' half-hour bulletin for broadcast across the Gippsland, Bendigo, Shepparton and Ballarat markets.  The Albury/Upper Murray local market instead received a delayed broadcast of the Sydney-based ''Ten Eyewitness News'' bulletin in the 6.00pm hour as an alternative to Melbourne-based bulletins being broadcast on rival channels [[VTV (TV station)|VIC TV]] and [[RVN/AMV|Prime Television]].

In May 1994, SCN was re-branded '''Ten Victoria'''.  The local news bulletins of GLV/BCV were axed, as was the statewide ''SCN Eyewitness News''.  News coverage was now a straight relay of the Melbourne edition of ''Ten News'' from [[ATV-10]] with no local or state-based news bulletins.

Local news was reintroduced to the station in 2004 in the form of three-minute updates at various times of the day, presented by Julie Snook(Bendigo, Ballarat, Albury and Gippsland)

In Shepparton and the Golburn Valley, viewers also receive a regional news magazine program called ''Weeknights'' at 6:30pm on weekdays. The locally-produced program, launched on Monday 21 March 2011, is presented by Joel Crean with reporters Peter Cardamone, Emily Whitham and regular contributors Donnellan &amp; Jordan Peters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.televisionau.com/2011/03/sc-ten-goes-local-in-shepparton.html SC Ten goes local in Shepparton], TalkingTelevision.au, 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers in the rest of the region receive a simulcast of ''[[6.30 with George Negus]]'' at 6:30pm on weeknights.

Notes:
*1. [[height above average terrain|HAAT]] estimated from http://www.itu.int/SRTM3/ using EHAAT.
*2. The Latrobe Valley station was on VHF channel 10 from its 1961 sign-on until 1980, moving to VHF channel 8 in order to accommodate [[ATV (TV station)|ATV]] Melbourne's switch from VHF channel 0 to channel 10. It moved to its current channel in 2000 in order to accommodate digital television in Melbourne.
*3. The Bendigo station also broadcasts on analog ([[ultra high frequency|UHF]]) channel 38 with 1200&amp;nbsp;kW ERP at 508 m HAAT.
*4. Swan Hill translator initially broadcast on VHF channel 11 from sign-on in 1967 until early 1990s when it changed to VHF channel 10.
*5. Analogue transmissions ceased as of 5 May 2011 as part of the conversion to digital television.
