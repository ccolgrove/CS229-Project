'''Closed source''' is a term for software released or distributed without the corresponding [[source code]].  Generally, it means only the [[binary file|binaries]] of a [[computer program]] are distributed and the license provides no access to the program's [[source code]].  The ''source code'' of such programs might be regarded as a [[trade secret]] of the company. Access to source code by third parties commonly requires the party to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]].
