'''Route 30''' is an east&amp;ndash;west arterial, connecting [[Grafton, Massachusetts|Grafton]] with [[Packard's Corner]] in [[Boston]].  Route 30 runs roughly parallel to the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]], but unlike those two larger highways, takes a more meandering path from town to town. Between Boston and the [[Charles River]] it is known as [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue]], along most of this route is part of the course of the [[Boston Marathon]].

Route 30 has two interchanges with the Mass Pike, at Exits 13 in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]] and 14/15 in [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]]; the latter also includes the junction with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]). It also has two interchanges with Route 9, one in [[Westborough, Massachusetts|Westborough]] and one at the [[Southborough, Massachusetts|Southborough]]-Framingham border (where the two highways have an interchange without actually crossing), as well as a section further east in Framingham that runs concurrently with Route 9, for a total of four junctions between Routes 9 and 30.

==Route description==
Route 30 begins in [[Grafton, Massachusetts|North Grafton]] at [[Massachusetts Route 122|Route 122]], where it shares a roadway briefly with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]]. The route travels northeast, passing the [[Tufts University]] [[Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine]]. The road continues into [[Westborough, Massachusetts|Westborough]], where it crosses [[Massachusetts Route 135|Route 135]] at a rotary and interchanges with [[Massachusetts|Route 9]] to the northeast.  After crossing Route 9, Route 30 turns eastward, crossing underneath [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] without an interchange. The route continues east into [[Southborough, Massachusetts|Southborough]], where it crosses [[Massachusetts Route 85|Route 85]]. Route 30 interchanges once again with Route 9 (without actually crossing it) and continues to parallel the highway into [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]]. In Framingham, Route 30 joins Route 9 in an approximately one-mile concurrency, and leaves via an interchange with [[Massachusetts Route 126|Route 126]] (heading eastward, there is a very brief concurrency between routes 30 and 126; heading westward, Route 30 joins Route 9 one block west of the Route 126 interchange). Route 30 continues to the northeast and interchanges with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. Route 30 continues northeast, crossing over the Mass Pike, and very briefly entering [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]] before entering [[Wayland, Massachusetts|Wayland]]. In Wayland, Route 30 crosses [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]] and continues northeast, very closely paralleling the Mass Pike.  Route 30 continues into [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]], where it enters a large interchange with the Mass Pike and [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] ([[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]). Upon crossing over I-95 and the Charles River, there is a drastic change in scenery as one crosses from Boston's suburbs to the metropolitan area. With this, Route 30 enters [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], crossing over the Mass Pike again and then crossing [[Massachusetts Route 16|Route 16]]. Route 30 winds to the east, passing [[Boston College]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]] and entering [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]] before ending at [[U.S. Route 20 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 20]] at Packard's Corner, approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}} west of downtown Boston.
