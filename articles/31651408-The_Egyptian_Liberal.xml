'''Sameh Naguib''' ({{lang-ar|Ø³Ø§ÙØ­ ÙØ¬ÙØ¨}}, {{IPA-arz|ËsÃ¦ËmeÄ§ nÃ¦ËÉ¡iËb|IPA}}) is an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[sociologist]] at the [[American University in Cairo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/418296 | title=Egyptâs workers: Between party politics and unionization | publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm | date=1 May 2011 | accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[socialist]] activist and a leading member of the [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] organization the [[Revolutionary Socialists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://socialistworker.org/2011/02/23/interview-with-egyptian-socialist | title=Conversation with an Egyptian socialist | publisher=Socialist Worker (US) | date=23 February 2011 | accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he described [[Hezbollah]]'s defeat of the [[Israeli Defense Force]] in the [[2006 Lebanon War|Lebanon War]] as &quot;a very important victory for the [[anti-war movement]] worldwide&quot;, claiming it prevented or delayed [[US]] and [[Israel]]i plans to attack [[Iran]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=9521 | title=Sameh Naguib in Egypt: âIsraelâs defeat has transformed the regionâ | publisher=Socialist Worker (UK) | date=26 August 2006 | accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naguib has also criticized others on the [[far-left]] of not differentiating between [[Islam]]ic organizations such as [[al-Qaeda]] - whom he labels a network of &quot;individual [[Terrorism|terrorists]]&quot;, [[Hamas]] and Hezbollah - &quot;[[National Liberation Movement|national liberation]] movements&quot;, and the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] - &quot;[[Reformism|reformist]] mass movements&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=363 | title=Interview: Egyptâs strike wave | publisher=International Socialism | date=28 September 2007 | accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Naguib was a speaker at the fifth [[Cairo Anti-war Conference]], which he used as a platform to condemn former [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] and pointed to Egypt's striking workers as a way forward for the movement: 

:''[T]he struggle against Mubarakâs regime is just in its beginning and not end as the regime hopes. Despite the constitutional coup, passed by force and forgery, the Egyptian state terrorism will not intimidate us. Their laws and dictatorial constitution will not deter us from fighting for freedom and justice.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arabawy.org/2007/03/30/5th-cairo-anti-war-conference-opens/ | title=5th Cairo Anti-War Conference opens | publisher=3arabawy | date=30 March 2007 | accessdate=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
