The '''ArkansasâTexas A&amp;M football rivalry''', also known as the '''Southwest Classic''', is an American [[college football]] rivalry between the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team of the [[University of Arkansas]] and the [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football]] team of [[Texas A&amp;M University]].  The football rivalry dates back to 1903.

==Series history==
Arkansas and A&amp;M first played each other in 1903. From 1934 until 1991, the two teams played annually as [[Southwest Conference]] members, but ceased in 1991 when Arkansas left the conference to join the [[Southeastern Conference]]. Arkansas leads all-time 41â24â3.

==Rivalry renewal in Dallas-Fort Worth area==
On March 10, 2008, officials from both schools announced the revival of the series would recommence on October 3, 2009. The annual location for the game was announced as [[Cowboys Stadium]], located in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]]. The attendance for the stadium was initially expected to be in the 80,000 range. Depending on ticket demand, temporary seating can be added to the stadium to increase the capacity up to 100,000 seats for the game. The tickets were said to be split 50/50 between the two schools. The initial agreement between the two schools allowed the game to be played for at least 10 years, followed by 5 consecutive, 4-year rollover options, allowing the game to potentially be played for a total of 30 consecutive seasons. The rivalry will continue for every year as Texas A&amp;M joins the Southeastern Conference beginning July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;
