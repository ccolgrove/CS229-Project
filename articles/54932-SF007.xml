'''''King Ottokar's Sceptre''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le Sceptre d'Ottokar'''}}) is the eighth of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', a series of classic comic-strip albums, written and illustrated by Belgian writer and illustrator [[HergÃ©]], featuring the young reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]]. It was first serialized as a black-and-white comic strip in ''[[Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me]]'' on 4 August 1938. A new colour version was drawn and published in 1947. This is the only Tintin adventure that can be safely classified as a ''[[locked room mystery]]''.

==Synopsis==
Tintin finds a lost briefcase and returns it to the owner, Professor Hector [[Alembic]]k, who is a [[sigillography|sigillographer]], an expert on [[seal (device)|seals]] (as in the sort used to make state documents official). He shows Tintin his collection of seals, including one which belonged to the [[Syldavia]]n King Ottokar IV. Tintin then discovers that he and Alembick are under [[surveillance]] by some strange men. Tintin's flat is even bombed in an attempt to kill him. Suspecting a Syldavian connection, Tintin offers to accompany Alembick to Syldavia via [[Frankfurt]] and [[Prague]] for research.

On the plane Tintin begins to suspect his companion. The Alembick travelling with him does not smoke and doesn't seem to need the spectacles he wears - to the point that he can make out a pretty pattern made by the sheep in a field that the plane passed over - while the Alembick he first met did smoke and had poor eyesight. During a layover, Tintin fakes a fall and grabs Alembick's beard, thinking it is false and Alembick is an imposter. However, the beard proves to be real and Tintin decides to let the matter drop, assuming that Alembick simply gave up smoking and is better at long distances than close-up- but then, while flying over Syldavia, it is the pilot of the plane who opens a trap door and Tintin drops out, landing in a haywagon.

Tintin has a hunch that a plot is afoot to steal the [[sceptre]] of King Ottokar IV. In Syldavia, the reigning King must possess the sceptre to rule or he will be forced to [[abdicate]], a tradition established after a past king used the sceptre to defeat a would-be assassin. Every year he rides in a parade during [[St. Vladimir]]'s Day carrying it, while the people sing the [[national anthem]]. Tintin succeeds in warning the reigning [[Minor characters in The Adventures of Tintin#King Muskar XII|King Muskar XII]], despite the efforts of the conspirators. He and the King rush to the royal treasure room to find Alembick, the royal photographer and some guards unconscious and the sceptre missing.

Tintin's friends [[Thomson and Thompson]] are summoned to investigate but their theory on how the sceptre was stolen â the thief throwing the sceptre through the iron bars over the window â proves to be inaccurate. Later on, Tintin notices a spring cannon in a toy shop and this gives him the clue. Professor Alembick had asked for some photographs to be taken of the sceptre, but the camera was a spring cannon in disguise, which allowed him to 'shoot' the sceptre out of the castle through the window bars into a nearby forest.

Searching the forest, Tintin spots the sceptre being found by agents of the neighbouring country, [[Borduria]]. Following them all the way to the border, he wrestles the sceptre from them. In the wallet of one of the thieves he discovers papers that show that the theft of the sceptre was just part of a major plan for a [[coup d'Ã©tat|takeover]] of Syldavia by their long-time political rival, [[Borduria]].

Tintin steals a [[Me-109]] from a Bordurian airfield (whose squadron is being kept ready to take part in the envisioned invasion of Syldavia) to fly it back to the King in time. He is shot down by the Syldavians who have naturally opened fire on an enemy aircraft violating their airspace. He manages to make the rest of the journey by foot.

Meanwhile the [[Interior Minister]] informs the King that rumours have been spreading that the sceptre has been stolen and that there have been riots against local Bordurian businesses, acts which would justify a Bordurian takeover of the country. The King is about to [[abdicate]] when Snowy runs in with the sceptre (which had fallen out of Tintin's pocket).

Tintin then gives the King the papers he took from the man who stole the sceptre. They prove that the plot was masterminded by MÃ¼sstler, leader of the [[Zyldav Zentral RevolutzionÃ¤r KomitzÃ¤t]], a political organisation. The King takes action by having MÃ¼sstler and his associates arrested and the army mobilised along the Bordurian frontier. In response, the Bordurian leader pulls his own troops back from the border.

The next day is [[15 July|St. Vladimir's Day]] and Tintin is made a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican, the first non-Syldavian to receive such an honour. Further inquiries by the authorities reveal that Professor Alembick is one of a pair of [[identical twin]]s: Hector Alembick was kidnapped and replaced with his brother Alfred who left for Syldavia in his place.

Tintin and Snowy return home by a [[flying boat]] with Thomson and Thompson, who suffer momentary panic when the aircraft appears to be falling into the sea at the end of the flight. The reader is treated to a rare &quot;[[fourth wall|wink to the camera]]&quot; from Tintin, who points out their error, and they laugh about it so much that they do indeed fall into the sea as they disembark.

==Politics==
Like earlier stories such as ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' and ''[[The Broken Ear]]'', ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' had a political subtext. The theft of the Sceptre is just part of a plot by Borduria to plunge Syldavia into a major political crisis and clear the way for a foreign invasion. 

Written in  1938, the story could have been influenced by the Anschluss of Austria by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. The unseen leader of the [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] is called MÃ¼sstler, a blend of [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. MÃ¼sstler is the head of the Iron Guard.{fact}} The name implies that it is a pro-[[fascist]] [[paramilitary]] group, which were common in Europe between the wars. An actual fascist and anti-Semitic group called the [[Iron Guard]] was very active in [[Romania]] in the years leading up to the [[Second World War]]. The Romanian Iron Guard was often in violent conflict with the King of Romania, King [[Carol II]], who they accused of corruption and being influenced by his Jewish mistress. In fact the year the repression of the Iron Guard commenced was 1938, the year ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was first serialised. The leader of the Iron Guard, [[Codreanu]], was executed for treason by the Romanian government. The Iron Guard briefly formed the government in 1940 under [[Horia Sima]] after the King's abdication but Hitler ended up backing the more conservative General [[Antonescu]] in January 1941 and the Iron Guard was eliminated from government and purged.

The German censors did not obstruct the book during the occupation of [[Belgium]] during [[World War II]]. This could be because there were frequent schemes, plots, wars and coups in the history of the Balkans, many of which had native fascistic movements or governments during the 1930s, and it was not clear that HergÃ© was specifically targeting National Socialist Germany. Moreover, as discussed above, Germany supported the authoritarian regime in Romania under the aegis of a King, a regime that actually violently repressed the Romanian Iron Guard.

==Publication history==
This adventure was originally published under the name ''Tintin en Syldavie'' (&quot;Tintin in Syldavia&quot;) and appeared in black-and-white in the newspaper supplement ''[[Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me]]'' between 1938 and 1939.

The story was redrawn and colourised in 1947. For this edition, [[HergÃ©]] was assisted by [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs]], a highly-regarded artist in his own right. Jacobs is credited with much of the [[Balkan]] feel of the new edition.

In terms of the plot and appearance of the characters, the two editions are generally similar. The principal aesthetic difference, aside from the colour, is that the backgrounds in the 1938-39 edition were generally blank, whereas in 1947 the streets of the towns, the countryside and the interior of the flats and palaces are more detailed.

Other changes affected the appearance of the Syldavian court. In the 1938 version, the Royal Guards are dressed like British [[Beefeaters]]; the 1947 version has them dressed in a more Balkan-like uniform. In 1939, Tintin is knighted while dressed in his raincoat, and a tear comes to his eye when he receives his medal in a ceremony which, aside from the Queen, is attended only by men; in 1947, he wears a suit, shows embarrassment but no tears, there are ladies attending, and there are also caricatures of HergÃ© and Jacobs in uniform, along with a number of colleagues and relatives.&lt;ref name=TintinTheCompleteCompanion&gt;''Tintin: The Complete Companion'' by [[Michael Farr]], John Murray publishers, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

All the aircraft featured in the book are carefully drawn from real contemporary designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://membres.lycos.fr/wings2/tintin/sceptre/sceptre.htm le sceptre d'Ottokar&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1939 version, the plane Tintin uses to escape from Borduria, seems to resemble a [[Heinkel He 118]]. However, in the 1947 version, the [[Heinkel]]s are replaced by the more famous [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]s.

==Connections with other Tintin books==

Although [[Thomson and Thompson|the twin detectives]] had first appeared in ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]'' in 1934 and had featured in the three adventures that followed, they were not given actual names until the 1938-9 ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' when Tintin introduces them by name to Alembick at the airport.

Two recurring Tintin characters are introduced in ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'': [[Bianca Castafiore]], and [[Colonel Jorgen|Colonel Boris]], who was to re-appear under the name of Jorgen in ''[[Destination Moon (Tintin)|Destination Moon]]'' and its sequel ''[[Explorers on the Moon]]''.

==Syldavian language==
{{main|Syldavian language}}

Like many of the fictional languages in the ''Tintin'' books, the Syldavian language is based on the slang of the [[Marols|Marolliens]], the people of the [[working class]] quarter of [[Brussels]], with the addition of some s and z sounds to make it sound more [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]. For example, the Syldavian motto, &quot;Eih bennek, eih blavek&quot;, means &quot;If you gather thistles, expect prickles&quot; according to the book, but the 'Syldavian' words in fact resemble Marollien dialect for &quot;Here I am, here I stay.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zompist.com/syldavian.html HergÃ©'s Syldavian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
A semi-animated film based on the book was released in 1956, produced by the company [[Belvision]], who would later produce the first Tintin television series, ''[[Herge's Adventures of Tintin]]''. The film was produced by [[Karel Van Millegham]] and [[Anne-Marie Ullmann]].

The 1990s [[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|''Adventures of Tintin'']] animated series changed the story. There is no 'Anchluss' aspect whatsoever, although it is clear that those scheming to steal the sceptre are based in a neighbouring state, as that is where they attempt to flee once they have it in their possession. Also, the Alembick twin who smokes becomes the bad one of the two.

== Minor errors==
The brochure on Syldavia read by Tintin states that Syldavia, along with the rest of the Balkans, was invaded by the Turks in the 10th century. As the Turks were not to invade the Balkans until the second half of the 14th century, this seems improbable.

While sheltering from a rain storm in the entrance of a museum, Snowy steals a bone from a ''[[Diplodocus]]'', a &quot;Giganticus&quot; bone. Although the genus (''Diplodocus'') exists, the species (''giganticus'') doesn't. It might have been written that way for amusement.

In Borduria, Tintin steals a [[Bf 109]] but eventually has to bail out when the [[Syldavia]]ns shoot him down. In the panel where Tintin struggles to get out of the burning plane, the canopy slides back but in fact the canopy of a Bf 109 opens like a lid.
