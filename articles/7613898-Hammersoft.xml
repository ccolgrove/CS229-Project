===Digiturk and MTVNI===
MTV Turkey was removed from [[Digiturk]] on May 22, 2010 with no reason given to the customers, which caused a small controversy amongst customers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medyafaresi.com/haber/40848/medya-mtv-turkiye-ve-nickelodeon-digiturkten-cikarildi.html&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2010, it was reported that [[MTV Networks International]] cancelled [[Multichannel Developers]]'s (the company that operated MTV Turkiye) licence a month ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haberfx.net/mtvni-mcd-ile-olan-lisans-sozlesmesini-feshetti-haberi-212830/&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, MTV Turkiye's website closed with a text saying that their new site will be available as soon as possible.
