'''Yellow Air Taxi''' (a marketing name of Friendship Airways) is an [[air taxi]] [[airline]] based in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], [[United States|USA]]. It operates On-Demand passenger services in the [[South (US)|Southeast]], [[Florida]], the [[Caribbean]] and, the [[Bahamas]]. YAT grew from a small operation out of Pompano Beach to a fleet of 4 Cessna 402Cs, all painted in yellow with a white/black checkerboard tail.  The carrier had some issues with the US DOT, bordering on offering scheduled service as a charter airline.&lt;ref&gt;see U.S. DOT docket OST-2005-20077&lt;/ref&gt;  Once legal to fly more than 4 flights a week, YAT expanded to Naples &amp; Key West, along with offering 3 flights a day to Marsh Harbour &amp; Treasure Cay from Ft. Lauderdale.  Miami service was attempted in 2009.   YAT started being affected by the high-seasonality of both the Florida Keys &amp; Bahamas and the carrier relinquished their scheduled authority in 2009.  Sorry they did not relinquish their authority. They were stripped of the scheduled authority by the FAA. Yellow Air Taxi is currently out of business they are not operating at all. These posts are for truthful and newsworthy information. Not for some spin doctor.On February 18, 2011, an involuntary petition for liquidation under Chapter 7 was filed against Friendship Airways Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=127680532]&lt;/ref&gt;
