The '''Carolina&amp;ndash;Clemson Rivalry''' is an American [[college rivalry]] between the [[South Carolina Gamecocks]] sports teams of the [[University of South Carolina]] and the [[Clemson Tigers]] sports teams of [[Clemson University]].  Both institution are public universities supported by the state of [[South Carolina]], and their campuses are separated by only 132 miles.  South Carolina and Clemson have been bitter rivals since the 1880s, and a heated rivalry continues to this day for a variety of reasons, including the historic tensions regarding their respective charters and the passions surrounding their athletic programs.

Both universities are members of premier collegiate athletic conferences: South Carolina is in the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC); Clemson is in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC).

Unlike most major college rivalries, the CarolinaâClemson rivalry did not start innocently. In fact, the seeds of bitterness were planted even before Clemson became a college.  The two institutions were founded 88 years apart:  '''South Carolina College''' in 1801 and '''Clemson Agricultural College''' in 1889.

South Carolina College was founded in 1801 to unite and promote harmony between the [[South Carolina Low Country|Lowcountry]] and the Backcountry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1951 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = I | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It closed during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when its [[South Carolina College Cadets|students]] aided the [[Confederate States of America|Southern cause]], but the closure gave the politicians an opportunity to reorganize it to their liking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1951 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = I | pages = 212â225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Radical Republicans]] in charge of state government during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] opened the school to blacks and women while appropriating generous funds to the University.  These actions caused the white citizens of the state to withdraw their support for the University&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and view it as a symbol of the worst aspects of Reconstruction.

The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] returned to power in 1877 following their [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876|decisive electoral victory]] over the Radical Republicans and promptly proceeded to close the University.  Sentiment in the state favored opening an agriculture college so the University was reorganized as the '''South Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1882, the college was renamed to its antebellum name, South Carolina College, which infuriated the farmers because they felt that the politicians had frustrated the will of the people by deemphasizing agriculture education, even though the school still retained the department of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agitation from the farmers===
[[Benjamin Tillman]] emerged in the 1880s as a leader of the agrarian movement in South Carolina and demanded that the South Carolina College take agricultural education more seriously by expanding the agriculture department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ball | first = William Watts | title = The State That Forgot; South Carolina's Surrender to Democracy | year = 1932 | publisher = The Bobbs-Merrill Company | page = 210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, Tillman was convinced of the superiority of a separate agricultural college by [[Stephen D. Lee]], then the President of the [[Mississippi State University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of the State of Mississippi]], and subsequently Tillman would accept nothing less than a separate agriculture college in South Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp134&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 134}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He offered the following reasons why he felt that it was necessary to have a separate agriculture college outside the confines of [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]]:

#Mississippi A&amp;M featured practical training without unnecessary studying of the liberal arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp134&quot;/&gt;
#Mississippi A&amp;M provided poor students work-scholarships so that they could attend the college.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp134&quot;/&gt;
#There were too few students who studied agriculture at the College to justify an agriculture college there.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp134&quot;/&gt;
#The College was a place &quot;for the sons of lawyers and of the well-to-do&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ball | first = William Watts | title = The State That Forgot; South Carolina's Surrender to Democracy | year = 1932 | publisher = The Bobbs-Merrill Company | page = 212}}&lt;/ref&gt; who sneered at the agriculture students as if they were hayseeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp138&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 138}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The students at the College lived a life of luxury as compared with the sweat and toil endured by students at Mississippi A&amp;M.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp152&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#There was not enough farm land near the College to allow for proper agriculture study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bourbon Democrat|Conservatives]], who held the [[rein]]s of power in South Carolina from 1877 to 1890, replied to each point made by Tillman:
#The most advanced agriculture educational research was being conducted at the [[University of California]] and at [[Cornell University]], both of which combined agriculture colleges with liberal arts colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, a separate agriculture college would be more expensive and result in an inferior product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The work scholarships attracted the lowest quality of students who only cared about obtaining a college degree, not about an education in agriculture or mechanical studies.  Furthermore, there was little advantage of attending a college only to pitch manure and grub stumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | pages = 139â140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The constant attacks by Tillman on the College caused many to doubt whether state support for the institution would continue.  As a result, the enrollment numbers were not impressive, although the numbers of students taking agriculture and mechanical classes increased from 34 in 1887 to 83 in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Over half of the students at the College were the sons of farmers, though most did not study agriculture as Tillman wished.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp138&quot;/&gt;  [[John McLaren McBryde]], [[Presidents of the University of South Carolina|President of the College]], correctly predicted that most students of an agriculture college would not go back to work the farm after graduation.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp138&quot;/&gt;
#While some students at the College were the sons of the well-to-do, the majority were poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp152&quot;/&gt;
#The College farm added {{convert|100|acre|km2|1}} in 1887, just one mile from campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clemson's will ===
Tillman was bolstered in 1886 when [[Thomas Green Clemson]] agreed to will his [[Fort Hill (Clemson)|Fort Hill estate]] for the establishment of an agriculture college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Simkins | first = Francis Butler | title = Pitchfork Ben Tillman | year = 2002 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, Tillman did not want to wait until Clemson died to start a separate agriculture college so he pushed the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] to use the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill funds]] and [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch funds]] for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, the legislature gave those funds to the South Carolina College in 1887 which would use them along with a greater state appropriation to reorganize itself as the second University of South Carolina and to also greatly expand the agriculture department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After this victory for South Carolina, in January 1888 Tillman wrote a letter to the ''[[The Post and Courier|News and Courier]]'' that he was retiring from public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball 1932 215&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Ball | first = William Watts | title = The State That Forgot; South Carolina's Surrender to Democracy | year = 1932 | publisher = The Bobbs-Merrill Company | page = 215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was less than ninety days when Tillman reemerged on the scene upon the death of Thomas Green Clemson in April 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Francis Butler | last = Simkins | title = The Tillman movement in South Carolina | year = 1964 | publisher = Duke University Press | page = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tillman advocated that the state accept the gift by Clemson, but the [[Bourbon Democrat|Conservatives]] in power opposed the move and an all out war for power in the state commenced.  The opening salvo was fired by Gideon Lee, the father of Clemson's granddaughter and [[John C. Calhoun]]'s great granddaughter Floride Isabella Lee, who wrote a letter on her behalf to the ''News and Courier'' in May that she was being denied as Calhoun's rightful heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooperp164&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = William | title = The Conservative Regime: South Carolina, 1877-1890 | year = 2005 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | isbn = 1-57003-597-0 | page = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he stated that Clemson was egotistical and &quot;only wanted to erect a monument to his own name.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooperp164&quot;/&gt;  In November, Lee filed a lawsuit in Federal Court to contest the will which ultimately ruled against him in May 1889.

The [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1888|election of 1888]] afforded Tillman an opportunity to convince the politicians to accept the Clemson bequest or face the possibility of being voted out of office.  He demanded that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] nominate its candidates by the [[Primary election|primary system]], which was denied, but they did accept his request that the candidates for statewide office [[Canvassing|canvass]] the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp151&quot;&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tillman proved excellent on the stump, by far superior to his Conservative opponents, and as the Democratic convention neared there was a clear groundswell of support for the acceptance of Clemson's estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = William | title = The Conservative Regime: South Carolina, 1877-1890 | year = 2005 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | isbn = 1-57003-597-0 | page = 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was so effective because of his &quot;ability to awaken popular passion and prejudice&quot; when the populace by and large mistook &quot;prejudice for truth, passion for reason, and invective for documentation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HollisIIp151&quot;/&gt;  Tillman pitted &quot;the poor against the rich, tenant against landowner, hireling against employer, country against town, all of South Carolina against Charleston and Columbia, upcountry against lowcountry, white against black, do-somethings against do-nothings, and outs against those in power&quot; so that &quot;he could rile them up and then appear as their champion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter B. | last = Edgar | title = South Carolina:  A History | year = 1998 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 438}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Conservative leadership was aging and its appeal to the past glories of South Carolina during the [[Antebellum era|antebellum period]] meant little to the emerging younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = William | title = The Conservative Regime: South Carolina, 1877-1890 | year = 2005 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | isbn = 1-57003-597-0 | page = 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bequest barely wins support===
Tillman explained his justification for an independently controlled agriculture college by pointing to the mismanagement and political interference of the University of South Carolina as had occurred during Reconstruction.  The agriculture college, as specified in Clemson's will, was to be privately controlled and thus would be able to prevent any &quot;possible invasion by the negroes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball 1932 215&quot;/&gt;  With declining cotton prices, Tillman played upon the farmer's desperation by stating that the salaries of the college professors were exorbitant and it must be a sign of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ball | first = William Watts | title = The State That Forgot; South Carolina's Surrender to Democracy | year = 1932 | publisher = The Bobbs-Merrill Company | page = 209}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the legislature was compelled to pass the bill to accept Clemson's bequest in December 1888, albeit with the tie-breaking vote in the [[South Carolina Senate|state Senate]] from [[Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina|Lieutenant Governor]] [[William L. Mauldin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooperp164&quot;/&gt;  Thus was reborn the antagonistic feelings of regional bitterness and class division that would plague the state for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = William | title = The Conservative Regime: South Carolina, 1877-1890 | year = 2005 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | isbn = 1-57003-597-0 | page = 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having achieved his agriculture college, Tillman was not content to sit idly by because what he really desired was power and political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter B. | last = Edgar | title = South Carolina:  A History | year = 1998 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 437}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After winning the [[South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1890|1890 election]] and becoming [[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]], Tillman renewed the attacks on the Conservatives and those who had thwarted his agriculture college.  He saved the coup de grÃ¢ce for [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Wade Hampton III]], a South Carolina College graduate and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General during the Civil War, who &quot;invoked Confederate service and honor as a barrier to Tillmanism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooperp206&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Cooper | first = William | title = The Conservative Regime: South Carolina, 1877-1890 | year = 2005 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | isbn = 1-57003-597-0 | page = 206}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tillman directed the legislature to defeat Hampton's renomination for another term in December 1890, thereby finishing what [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] had left undone in 1865.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cooperp206&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Daniel Walker | last = Hollis | title = University of South Carolina | year = 1956 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | volume = II | page = 157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While campaigning for Governor in 1890, Tillman leveled his harshest criticism towards the University of South Carolina and threatened to close it along with [[The Citadel (military college)|The Citadel]], which he called a &quot;dude factory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter B. | last = Edgar | title = South Carolina:  A History | year = 1998 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | pages = 437, 439}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the rhetoric, Tillman only succeeded in reorganizing the University of South Carolina into a liberal arts college while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Walter B. | last = Edgar | title = South Carolina:  A History | year = 1998 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 439}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It would eventually be rechartered for the last time in 1906 as the University of South Carolina.  However, Clemson Agricultural College held sway over the state legislature for decades and was generally the more popular college during the first half of the 20th century in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role reversal===
After [[World War II]], the long held perceptions of the two schools switched.  Whereas South Carolina was viewed as an elitist institution for much of its existence, it opened its doors to every qualified veteran and later encouraged minority enrollment.  Clemson on the other hand, claimed to have been founded for the common man, sought to restrict entrance to veterans returning from the war and has a substantially lower percentage of minorities in its student body (Clemson enrolled its [[Harvey Gantt|first African-American student]] in 1963).  Thus the University of South Carolina was able to achieve exponential growth as a result and reclaim the status as the most popular institution of higher education in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:USCvClemenrollment1945-2006.GIF|right|500px|South Carolina College Enrollment]]

In the 1950s, the University of South Carolina expanded its reach across the state by establishing branch campuses under the auspices of the [[University of South Carolina System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 109}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clemson, having obtained university status in 1964, tried to compete with this network in the 1960s by establishing branch campuses in [[Greenville, South Carolina|Greenville]] and [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]].  [[South Carolina House of Representatives|House]] [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] [[Solomon Blatt, Sr.|Sol Blatt]] was alarmed by the spread of Clemson and declared that USC &quot;should build as many two year colleges over the state as rapidly as possible to prevent the expansion of Clemson schools for the Clemson people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, the University of South Carolina began a new wave of expansion across the state and was aided by the fact that the Clemson extensions never proved popular.  In 1973, USC acquired the Clemson campus at Sumter due to disappointing enrollment numbers&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.uscsumter.edu/about/history.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Clemson's Greenville campus would return to its independent status as [[Greenville Technical College|Greenville Tech]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.gvltec.edu/about_greenvilletech/history.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued hostilities===
Respective achievements are never acknowledged in this family feud.  The turf issues are overlapping and complicated.  Competitions on the ballfields become cathartic experiences, as many of these rivals carry the virulence of yesteryear. &quot;Thereâs a history of bad blood between these institutions,&quot; says Jay McCormick, a doctoral candidate at USC. &quot;So when athletics came to Carolina and to Clemson, it was natural that they should be a rivalry. The rivalry extends back to political and social origins. Itâs not just an athletic rivalry. Itâs a manifestation of these things.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrobeat.Net&quot;&gt;[http://metrobeat.net/gbase/Expedite/Content?oid=oid%3A1647 Metrobeat.Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Carolina-Clemson football game (sometimes dubbed &quot;The Battle of the [[South Carolina|Palmetto State]]&quot; or the &quot;Palmetto Bowl&quot; from the state's nickname) is the longest uninterrupted series in the [[Southern United States|South]] and the second longest uninterrupted series overall, having been played every year since 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/08/countdown_to_football_31_days.html College football gets new oldest rivalry], College Football gets new oldest rivalry.&lt;/ref&gt;  The universities maintain college football stadiums in excess of 80,000 seats each, placing both in the top 18 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2006/2006_d1_football_records_book.pdf NCAA football records], p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Clemson holds a 65-40-4 lead in the series, which dates back to 1896. From 1896-1959, the Carolina-Clemson game was played in Columbia and referred to as &quot;Big Thursday.&quot;  Since 1960, the game has alternated between both teams' home stadiums as the regular season finale.  Though Clemson leads the football series, approximately forty games have been decided by a touchdown or less.  Clemson has more wins against South Carolina than any other program has,&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.stassen.com/cgi-bin/records/all-opp.pl?start=1869&amp;end=2006&amp;team=South+Carolina&amp;sort=l South Carolina all-opponent record 1869-2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and South Carolina is third behind Georgia Tech and Georgia in most wins against Clemson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.stassen.com/cgi-bin/records/all-opp.pl?start=1869&amp;end=2006&amp;team=Clemson&amp;sort=l Clemson all-opponent record 1869-2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, each school engages in a ritual involving the other team's mascot. South Carolina holds the &quot;Tiger Burn&quot;, and Clemson holds a mock funeral for [[Cocky (mascot)|Cocky]]. After 7 students (6 from USC, 1 from Clemson) died in the [[Ocean Isle Beach house fire]] in 2007, the Cocky funeral was cancelled and the Tiger Burn was changed to the &quot;Tiger Tear Down&quot; for that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2007/11/14/News/Tiger.Burn.Comes.Under.Fire-3098917.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clemson.edu/newsroom/articles/2008/november/Black_Friday.php5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.dailygamecock.com/media/storage/paper247/news/2007/11/15/News/Tiger.Burn.Update-3102793.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years: 1896â1902===
When Clemson began its football program in 1896, coached by Walter Riggs, they scheduled the rival South Carolina College for a Thursday morning game in conjunction with the State Fair.  Carolina won that game 12â6 and a new tradition was born â Big Thursday.

The Gamecock mascot made its first appearance in 1902.  In that first season as the Gamecocks, Carolina defeated a highly favored Clemson team coached by the legendary [[John Heisman]] 12â6.  But it was the full-scale riot that broke out in the wake of the game that is remembered most.

&quot;The Carolina fans that week were carrying around a poster with the image of a tiger with a gamecock standing on top of it, holding the tigerâs tail as if he was steering the tiger by the tail,&quot; says Jay McCormick.  &quot;Naturally, the Clemson guys didnât take too kindly to that, and on Wednesday and again on Thursday, there were sporadic fistfights involving brass knuckles and other objects and so forth, some of which resulted, according to the newspapers, in blood being spilled and persons having to seek medical assistance.  After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, youâre going to be in trouble. And naturally, of course, the Carolina students brought the poster to the parade. If you give someone an ultimatum and theyâre your rival, theyâre going to do exactly what you told them not to do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metrobeat.Net&quot;/&gt;

As expected, another brawl broke out before both sides agreed to mutually burn the poster in an effort to defuse tensions. The immediate aftermath resulted in the stoppage of the rivalry until 1909. The CarolinaâClemson game has been played every year since.

===World War II era===
[[World War II]] produced one of the most bizarre situations in the history of the rivalry.  Cary Cox, a football player of the victorious Clemson squad in 1942, signed up for the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 program]] in 1943 and was placed at USC.  The naval instructors at Carolina ordered him to play on the football team and he was named the captain for the Big Thursday game against Clemson.  Cox was reluctant to play against his former teammates and he voiced his concerns to coach Lt. James P. Moran who responded &quot;Cox, I can't promise you'll get a Navy commission if you play Thursday, but I can damn well promise that you won't get one if you don't play!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Henry H. | last = Lesesne | title = A History of the University of South Carolina, 1940-2000 | year = 2001 | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | page = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cox then went out and led the Carolina team to a 33-6 win against Clemson.  He returned to Clemson after the war and captained the 1947 team in a losing effort to Carolina, but Cox earned his place in history as the only player to captain both schools' football teams.

The 1946 game could be the most chaotic in the football series.  Counterfeit tickets were sold, and fans with legitimate and fake tickets were not allowed inside once the stadium filled, so many fans stormed the gates and were eventually allowed to stand along the sidelines of the field.  To add to the wild scene, a Clemson fan strangled a live chicken at midfield during halftime.  It took U.S. Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]], who attended the game along with [[Strom Thurmond]], to settle down the hostile crowd.  Carolina won the game 26-14.

===Modern era - Post WWII===
'''1961: The Prank'''&lt;br&gt;
In 1961, the USC fraternity [[Sigma Nu]] pulled what some have called the greatest prank in the rivalry's history.  A few minutes before Clemson football players entered the field for pre-game warm ups, a group of Sigma Nu fraternity members ran onto the field, jumping up and down and cheering in football uniforms that resembled the ones worn by the Tigers.  This caused the Clemson band to start playing &quot;Tiger Rag,&quot; which was followed by the pranksters falling down as they attempted to do calisthenics.  They would also do football drills where guys would drop passes and miss the ball when trying to kick it.  Clemson fans quickly realized that they had been tricked, and some of them angrily ran onto the field.  However, security restored order before any blows could be exchanged.  Carolina won the game 21-14.

'''1975: Most Points Scored by Carolina'''&lt;br&gt;
On November 22, 1975, Carolina defeated Clemson 56-20 to set a Gamecock record for most points scored in a football game against the Tigers.

'''1977: &quot;The Catch&quot;'''&lt;br&gt;
On November 19, 1977, Clemson WR [[Jerry Butler (American football)|Jerry Butler]] made a diving, backwards, 20-yard touchdown reception on a pass from QB Steve Fuller with 49 seconds left in the fourth quarter to give Clemson the 31-27 victory in Columbia. This play is known as &quot;The Catch&quot; and is one of the most memorable plays in the rivalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;scout&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://clemson.scout.com/a.z?s=46&amp;p=2&amp;c=814910&amp;ssf=1&amp;RequestedURL=http%3a%2f%2fclemson.scout.com%2f2%2f814910.html | title = &quot;The Catch&quot; Lives On  | date = 2008-11-26 | work = [[Scout.com]] | author = Will Vandervort | accessdate = 2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1980: Orange Pants'''&lt;br&gt;
In the last regular season game for the 1980 season, a heavily favored Carolina team traveled to Death Valley to take on the Tigers. In a surprise to both the players and the fans, Coach Danny Ford unveiled new orange uniform pants for the Tigers to wear. This was the first time in Clemson's history that they wore orange pants in any combination for a football game. Inspired by the pants, the underdog Tigers defeated the Gamecocks, 27-6.

'''1981: Clemson wins a [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|National Championship]]'''&lt;br&gt;
In 1981, [[1981 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] defeated Carolina 29-13 en route to the National Championship.  Clemson would be placed on probation on November 21, 1982, for a 2-year period.  This sanction was enforced on the program by the NCAA Committee on Infractions due to a lengthy history of recruiting violations to gain an athletic advantage that had taken place from 1977 through the Tigers' 1981 National Championship season and into 1982, under the administration of two head coaches, Charlie Pell and Danny Ford. Over 150 documented violations were found to have been committed under NCAA bylaws in the categories of improper recruiting inducements, extra benefits to student-athletes, unethical conduct, improper financial aid, improper campus visits, improper transportation and entertainment, improper use of funds, improper employment, improper recruiting contact, and distribution of cash to players by members of the coaching staff.&lt;ref&gt;https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&amp;key=369&amp;publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''1987: Highest Ranked Match-Up'''&lt;br&gt;
On November 21, 1987, with the highest combined rankings of the two football programs entering the game (the Gamecocks were #12 and the Tigers were #8), Carolina beat Clemson 20-7 on national television (ESPN).

'''2000: &quot;The Push-Off&quot;/&quot;The Catch II&quot;'''&lt;br&gt;
In 2000, Trailing late in the game 14-13, Clemson quarterback [[Woody Dantzler]] connected with wide-receiver [[Rod Gardner]] for a 50-yard reception to South Carolina's 8-yard line with 10 seconds remaining. Carolina fans point to a replay that seems to show Gardner pushing off the Gamecock defender, but Clemson fans contend that the contact was mutual and incidental.&lt;ref&gt;[http://secfootballblogger.com/2008/02/09/rod-gardner-push-off-video-south-carolina-vs-clemson-2000 ESPN video]&lt;/ref&gt; No penalty flag was thrown on the play, leaving Clemson kicker Aaron Hunt to kick a 25-yard field goal that gave Clemson a 16-14 win. Clemson fans remember this game as &quot;The Catch II&quot; while Carolina fans call it &quot;The Push-Off Game&quot;.

'''2003: Most Points Scored by Clemson'''&lt;br&gt;
In 2003, Clemson defeated Carolina 63-17, to set the record for the most points scored by either team in the series. 

'''2004: The Brawl'''&lt;br&gt;
The [[South Carolina-Clemson brawl]] during the 2004 football game is the most recent eruption of hostilities in this rivalry.  It is also the last time [[Lou Holtz]] coached, having retired shortly thereafter.  Clemson won the game 29-7.  Each team had won a total of six games that year and were technically bowl eligible.  However, both schools elected to forfeit their postseason because of the unsportsmanlike nature of the fight.

'''2005: A Quarterback Wins 4'''&lt;br&gt;
In 2005, the two teams showed an unusual gesture of sportsmanship by meeting at midfield before the game to shake hands, putting the melee of 2004 behind them.  Clemson won this game 13-9, leaving the Tiger's quarterback, Charlie Whitehurst, undefeated against USC in his 4 years at Clemson. The only Carolina quarterback to do so against the Tigers was Tommy Suggs, who led the Gamecocks to three victories in a row from 1968-1970.

'''2006: Kickers Make The Difference'''&lt;br&gt;
Clemson was leading 28-14 in the third quarter, with Carolina quarterback Blake Mitchell throwing three interceptions. The Gamecocks then scored 17 unanswered points, including two Mike Davis touchdown runs and a 35-yard field goal from Ryan Succop - the only points in the fourth quarter - to give the Gamecocks a 31-28 lead. Clemson kicker Jad Dean missed a field goal attempt wide left as time expired, to give Carolina the win.

'''2007: Last-Second Victory'''&lt;br&gt;
On November 24, 2007, Clemson kicker Mark Buchholz hit a 35-yard field goal as time expired to give #21 Clemson a memorable 23-21 victory over South Carolina. The win lifted Clemson coach [[Tommy Bowden]] to 7-2 all-time against the Gamecocks and 2-1 against USC coach [[Steve Spurrier]]. The 2007 game is notable as the first in the series with the winning points scored on the game's final play.

'''2009: Turning The Season Around'''&lt;br&gt;
On November 28, 2009, South Carolina upset #15 Clemson 34-17 in dominating fashion.  The game was marked by the Gamecock defense forcing three Tiger turnovers and limiting the ACC Atlantic Division champion's offense including holding [[Heisman Trophy]] hopeful [[C.J. Spiller]] to 18 rushing yards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/112809aaa.html South Carolina Dominates Clemson, 34-17]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball==
In baseball, the teams previously met four times during the regular season in mid-week games. Starting in 2010, the teams will compete against each other over the course of a single weekend, once on each home field, and once at [[Fluor Field at the West End]] in [[Greenville, SC]]. This was the first neutral-site game in the rivalry since the [[2002 College World Series]]. Both schools are perennially considered to be among the top programs in the country, giving the rivalry a prominent spot in college baseball beyond the state of South Carolina.

===College World Series in the 2000's===

The rivalry has taken a deeper hold in the 2000's, as twice in the decade the two teams battled, coincidentally in the semifinals both times, with the Tigers being 2-0 and needing only one win to advance to the championship, and the Gamecocks losing the first game and having to win twice to reach the finals out of the double elimination [[repechage]] round in both situations.

'''2002'''&lt;br&gt;
Leading up to the [[2002 College World Series|2002 semifinals]], Clemson had already won three out of four regular season games against Carolina.  The Gamecocks beat their rivals soundly, 12-4, and then beat the Tigers again, 10-2, the following day to advance to the national championship game. The Gamecocks fell to Texas 12-6 in the championship game, the last under the format where a one-game final was played.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/scar/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/07-media-guide South Carolina Baseball Media Guide 2007], p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''2010'''&lt;br&gt;
Eight years later, in what has been called [[2010 College World Series|The Last Bat at Rosenblatt]], an identical situation leading to the series began.  Clemson had taken both on-campus games from South Carolina in the regular season, including a lopsided 19-6 victory in the rubber match, played before over 8,000 fans at [[Carolina Stadium]] in Columbia, but had lost in the &quot;neutral site&quot; game.  The Gamecocks had just come off a 12-inning win against the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] less than 24 hours before, while the Tigers had two days of rest.  However, fatigue was not a factor as the Gamecocks won the first game, 5-1, on a dominating complete game pitching performance by reliever Michael Roth, who had not started a game in more than a year.  Carolina won the second game the following day, 4-3, to advance to the championship series against [[2010 UCLA Bruins baseball team|UCLA]], who they defeated, 7-1 (Game 1) and 2-1 (Game 2) to win the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship]].  South Carolina went on to win the National Championship again in 2011.

The rivalry extends beyond sports to the annual [[blood donation|blood drive]] between the two schools. Students, faculty and fans from the schools band together in an effort to collect blood before the holiday season when many are too busy to give blood. The blood drive is held from Monday through Friday the week before the football matchup. 2011 marked the 27th occurrence of the blood drive, with South Carolina winning for the fourth consecutive year with 4,079 pints versus Clemson's 3,041 pints of blood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.midlandsconnect.com/news/story.aspx?id=688482 Carolina Clemson blood drive saves thousands of lives&lt;/ref&gt; With 8,022 units of blood combined, 2009's total donations broke the former record of 7,390 units, set the previous year. The blood drive is sponsored by the [[American Red Cross]] at the University of South Carolina and the Gamma Lambda chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] national service fraternity at Clemson.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clemsonapo.org&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone who gives blood receives a free shirt, with the graphic on the back usually featuring a Tiger and Gamecock together and a statement explaining that even though the competition is part of the rivalry, both schools share the common ground of giving blood.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscnews.sc.edu/2008/11112008-STUD_Web062.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clemson.edu/newsroom/articles/2008/november/blood_drive.php5&lt;/ref&gt;
