Far Eastern University was founded in 1934 when the Far Eastern College and the Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance (IABF) merged.&lt;ref name=Ruegg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Public&gt;{{cite book | title = Elements of Public Speaking | edition = 4th | year = 1986 | editor1-last= Gupit, Jr. | editor1-first = Dr. Fortunato | publisher = [[Rex Bookstore]] | isbn = 9712304159 | page= 340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far Eastern College, founded in 1919, had been a [[liberal arts]] college in [[Quiapo]]; the IABF had been established (originally under the name Institute of Accountancy) by Nicanor Reyes, Sr., head of the Department of Economics of the [[University of the Philippines]], with a number of other prominent educators in 1928.&lt;ref name=Public/&gt;&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.feu.edu.ph/aboutus.php?value=2 | title = The History of FEU | work = feu.edu.ph | accessdate = 2009-09-10 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609135048/http://www.feu.edu.ph/aboutus.php?value=2 | archivedate = 2007-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; IABF had been originally predominately used by [[night school|night students]], and the new university, which was supported by the [[tuition]] provided by its students rather than government grants.&lt;ref name=Public/&gt;&lt;ref name=About/&gt;

In its earliest days, FEU was housed in a converted tobacco factory already present on the four [[hectare]] (nearly 10 [[acre]]) plot which would eventually host the current campus.&lt;ref name=Public/&gt;&lt;ref name=About/&gt; Reyes Sr. was appointed the first president of the University, which spent its early years establishing several of its institutes, including those of Law and Technology. Reyes commissioned [[Pablo Antonio]], who would later be titled [[National Artist of the Philippines]], to construct a building for the school.&lt;ref name=Deco&gt;{{cite news | url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/metro/view/20070115-43427/Art_Deco_buildings_thrive_on_FEU_campus | title = Art Deco buildings thrive on FEU campus | last = Ortiz | first = Margaux | date = 2007-01-15 | work = [[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] | accessdate = 2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the Nicanor Reyes Hall, which would later house the library and Institute of Accounting, Business and Finance, opened. Two other buildings by Antonio, the Girlsâ High School Building and Boys High School Building, followed in 1940 and 1941,&lt;ref name=Deco/&gt; by which year FEU had 10,000 registered students, with an international student population of 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Muddling Through: Development Under a &quot;Weak&quot; State | last = de Jesus | first = Edilberto C. | title = Local cultures and the &quot;new Asia&quot;: the state, culture, and capitalism in Southeast Asia | volume= 24 | series = Social Issues in Southeast Asia Series | editor1-last = Wan-Ling Wee | editor1-first= C.J. | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | year = 2002 | isbn = 9812301232 | page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], the campus was [[Military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], who left only its shell unharmed.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; Dr. Nicanor Reyes having been killed during the occupation, Dr. Hermenigildo B. Reyes was appointed the second president of the University when it reopened in 1945.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;

Thereafter, FEU continued to expand, with the opening of a Science Building and the establishment of the Institute of Medicine and the School of Nursing. In 1955, the FEU hospital was opened. Humanities were introduced in 1959, and in 1970 the Institute of Architecture and Fine Arts opened. Also in 1970, the for-profit status of the Institute of Medicine, School of Medical Technology, FEU Hospital and the Student Health Service Clinic was altered, when these were converted in the FEU Dr. Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, a non-stock, non-profit educational foundation.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;

1989 introduced substantial revitalization to FEU that took place over a number of years, with renovation and modernization of facilities and grounds and upgrading of the University's educational standard. This resulted in the [[accreditation]] of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, the Institute of Education, and the Institute of Accounts, Business and Finance, and, in the mid-1990s, the deregulation of the University by the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]]. The auditorium was upgraded to accommodate modern stage productions and the new twice-monthly presentations by local and international artists established by the President's Committee on Culture. The University also prioritized publication, launching a number of scholarly journals, and began networking with other institutions nationally and abroad.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;

==Campus==
Among the buildings on FEU's campus complex, five by Pablo Antonio garnered recognition for FEU in 2005 from the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), who bestowed the ''Asia Pacific Heritage Award for Cultural Heritage'' on the university for &quot;the outstanding preservation of its Art Deco structures.&quot;&lt;ref name=Deco/&gt; The buildings include the Nicanor Reyes Hall, the FEU East Asia College of Engineering and Computer Studies, the Law and Nursing Building, Auditorium/Administration Building and the Science Building. The buildings were constructed over a period of years ranging from 1939 to 1950 and reflect Antonio's evolution from [[Art Deco]] to the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] popularized in the area after World War II.&lt;ref name=Deco/&gt; The [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] also recognized the historical legacy of the buildings with a marker. Other historical buildings on the campus include the 1950s FEU Chapel, FEU Hospital, and the Arts and Sciences Building, which also represent the International Style.
