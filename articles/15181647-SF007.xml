As a student, Marsden came to public attention when she was at the center of the [[Simon Fraser University 1997 harassment controversy]], in which she and a [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] [[coach (sport)|coach]] publicly accused each other of [[sexual harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;

The coach was dismissed, then re-hired by the university after doubts were raised about the credibility of the accusations against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot; /&gt; Over ten years later, Marsden was interviewed by the university's newspaper and said of the events: &quot;[The administration] were more interested in quelling negative PR than defending the truth. I was told by SFU to keep quiet and say nothing to the media. My only regret is that I listened to them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

In September 2007, a relationship between Marsden and an [[Ontario Provincial Police]] officer ended. She posted his photo and identified him on her blog as an anti-terrorism officer who had leaked secret anti-terrorism documents to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/03/12/wales-wikipedia.html | work=CBC News | title=Wikipedia founder accused of agreeing to alter page: report | date=2008-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officer filed a complaint of harassment against Marsden, but this was later dropped. The OPP launched a separate internal investigation into the alleged conduct of the officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC-CP-Marsden&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/03/02/marsden-breakup.html|title=Canadian pundit, Wikipedia founder in messy breakup|date=2008-03-02|publisher=The Canadian Press|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On more than one occasion Marsden asked [[Wikipedia]] to delete her [[biography]] on the site. Her concerns led her to contact Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] in 2006, claiming that it was wrong and [[libel]]ous. Wales stated his involvement with her article was handled through the normal channels, and was &quot;routine&quot;. He also says he &quot;recused [himself] from any further official action&quot;, after their relationship became personal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jimbo&quot;&gt;

On February 29, 2008, the technology gossip blog [[Valleywag]] claimed Wales and Marsden had entered into a relationship, and published instant messaging chats they allegedly exchanged. On the following day Wales announced on his Wikipedia user page that he was no longer involved with her. In return, Marsden, who claimed to have learned about the breakup by reading about it at Wikipedia, turned to [[eBay]] and put up for auction a t-shirt and sweater with white stains that she claimed belonged to Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Agrell-2008-03-04&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smh&quot;&gt;
