The school has the third-largest endowment of any business school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/80077b42-43f0-11df-9235-00144feab49a,dwp_uuid=02e16f4a-46f9-11da-b8e5-00000e2511c8.html|title=Subtle Strategist|publisher=Financial Times, FT.com|accessdate =April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of United States business school rankings|Various rankings]] place Chicago Booth's MBA program among the best in the United States and in the world.

The school's flagship campus is located in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]] on the main campus of the university.  The school also maintains additional campuses in [[London]] and [[Singapore]], as well as in downtown Chicago on the [[Magnificent Mile]].  In addition to conducting graduate business programs, the school conducts research in the fields of [[finance]], [[economics]], [[quantitative marketing research|quantitative marketing]], and [[accounting]].

==History==
[[Image:Chicago-GSB-Szmurlo.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Chicago Booth]]
Chicago Booth traces its roots back to 1898 when university faculty member [[James Laurence Laughlin]] chartered the ''College of Commerce and Politics'', which was intended to be an extension of the school's founding principles of &quot;scientific guidance and investigation of great economic and social matters of everyday importance.&quot; The program originally served as a solely undergraduate institution until 1916, when academically oriented research masters and later doctoral-level degrees were introduced.

In 1916, the school was renamed the ''School of Commerce and Administration''. Soon after in 1922, the first [[doctorate]] program was offered at the school. In 1932, the school was rechristened as the ''School of Business''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts&quot; /&gt; The School of Business offered its first [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) in 1935. A landmark decision was taken by the school at about this time to concentrate its resources solely on graduate programs, and accordingly, the undergraduate program was phased out in 1942. In 1943, the school launched the first ever [[Executive MBA]] program. The school was renamed to ''Graduate School of Business'' (or more popularly, the ''GSB'') in 1959, a name that it held till 2008.

During the later half of the twentieth century, the business school was instrumental in the development of the [[Chicago School of Economics|Chicago School]], an economic philosophy focused on free-market, minimal government involvement, due to faculty and student interaction with members of the university's influential Department of Economics.  Other innovations by Chicago Booth include initiating the first [[PhD]] program in business (1920), founding the first academic business journal (1928), offering the first Executive MBA ([[EMBA]]) program (1943), and for offering the first weekend MBA program (1986).&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/9712/9712centennial2.html][http://www.chicagobooth.edu/about/history.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Students at the school founded the [[National Black MBA Association]] (1972), and Chicago Booth is the only U.S. business school with permanent campuses on three continents: Asia (2000), Europe (1994), and North America (1898).

==Academics==
Chicago Booth offers Full-time, Part-time (Evening and Weekend) and Executive MBA programs.  The University is also a major center for educating future academics, with graduate programs offering the A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in several fields. 

The program allows students to largely structure their own course of study subject to the constraint of a broad set of requirements. This is in contrast to other top-tier business schools, which impose a cohort or learning team system that includes coursework to be completed in a pre-determined order. The program differentiates itself by allowing students the flexibility to construct a program of study that is tailored to their needs, and can be as broad or deep as they choose.  There is only one required course for full-time and part-time program students: LEAD (Leadership Effectiveness and Development) [http://www.chicagogsb.edu/fulltime/academics/experiential/lead.aspx], which students take in their first quarter for full-time students and within the first four quarters for part-time students. [http://www.chicagobooth.edu/parttime/academics/experiential/leadership.aspx] LEAD focuses on the fundamental skills of leadership: motivating people, building relationships, and influencing outcomes. Students in the full time program may earn an International MBA, or IMBA, by studying abroad on exchange with another business school, taking certain electives, and by demonstrating oral proficiency in a second, non-native language.

The school's Executive MBA program is unique in that students may elect to spend the required residential periods on all three of the school's campuses worldwide (London, Chicago, Singapore), while also employing the cohort system. In Business Week Executive MBA Ranking 2009 the University of Chicago Booth School of Business landed in second place.&lt;ref&gt;MBA Channel: [http://www.mba-channel.com/channel/article/businessweek-kellogg-in-place-1/ BusinessWeek: Kellog ranked 1st], 16.11.2009&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Chicago Booth School of Business has begun a new program using Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and YouTube to reach prospective part-time M.B.A students.&lt;ref&gt;MBA Channel: [http://www.mba-channel.com/channel/article/chicago-the-booth-life/ Chicago: Social media to reach new students&quot;], 14.10.2009&lt;/ref&gt;
