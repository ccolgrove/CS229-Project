'''''The Westing Game''''' is a 1979 [[Newbery Medal]] winning novel by [[Ellen Raskin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal.cfm#70s|title=Newbery Medal &amp; Honor Books, 1922-Present|publisher=Association for Library Service to Children|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been adapted into a movie, released under both the names ''The Westing Game'' and ''[[Get a Clue (1997 film)|Get a Clue]]''.  This book centers around the adventures of Sam Westing's sixteen heirs after they are challenged by him to unravel the secret behind his death.

==Plot==
Sixteen individuals who are mysteriously chosen to live in the Sunset Towers apartment building on the shore of [[Lake Michigan]] come together to hear the will of the self-made millionaire, Samuel W. Westing. The will takes the form of a puzzle, dividing the sixteen heirs into eight pairs, giving each pair a different set of clues, and challenging them to solve the mystery of who killed Sam Westing. As an incentive, each heir is given $10,000 to play the game. Whoever solves the mystery will inherit Sam Westing's $200 million fortune.''' And have a better life.

==Clues by team==
''The clues in each case are listed in the order they were first listed in the book. In seven cases, they were capitalized and formed a separate paragraph; the capitalization is followed in this article.
*Table 1 (Madame Hoo and Jake)â
OF AMERICA AND GOD ABOVE

*Table 2 (Turtle and Flora Baumbach) â
SEA MOUNTAIN AM O

*Table 3 (Chris and Denton Deere)â
FOR PLAIN GRAIN SHED

*Table 4 (Sandy and Judge Ford)â
SKIES AM SHINING BROTHER

*Table 5 (Grace and Mr. Hoo)â
FRUITED PURPLE WAVES FOR SEA

*Table 6 (Crow and Otis Amber)â
WITH THY BEAUTIFUL MAJESTIES

*Table 7 (Theo and Doug)â
HIS N ON TO THEE FOR

*Table 8 (Angela and Sydelle)â
GOOD GRACE FROM HOOD SPACIOUS

These clues constituted almost all of the lyrics from &quot;[[America The Beautiful]].&quot; Sam Westing's will included words from the song as well.

==Solution==

The clues provided to the heirs are mostly words from the song &quot;[[America the Beautiful]]&quot;, taken out of order. When rearranged, it becomes clear that several words or parts of words are missing; these spell out one of the heir's name Berthe Erica Crow. Crow names herself as the solution. However, this is not the 'true' solution of the game. Judge J. J. Ford later recognizes this move as the &quot;queen's sacrifice&quot;, a move that Sam Westing would always use to defeat her in chess. So this proves that Sam Westing is  not dead.

The will does not state that Samuel Westing was murdered but rather that his &quot;life was taken.&quot; The will is broken down in sections of FIRST, SECOND, etc., totaling nineteen, and in the THIRD stated that &quot;the one who wins the windfall will be the one who finds the...&quot; and is interrupted by an outburst from Sandy McSouthers before continuing &quot;FOURTH. Hail to thee...&quot; Turtle realizes that there was no missing word after and that finding &quot;the Fourth&quot; was to find &quot;the fourth&quot; identity of Sam Westing. At this point, Turtle makes the connection that of the &quot;four winds&quot; mentioned in the will (North, East, South, and West), and that Windy WINDkloppel (the name Sam Westing was born with), Sam WESTing, Barney NORTHrup, Sandy McSOUTHers, and Julian R. EASTman are all the same person. Julian R. Eastman was the fourth identity that the heirs were truly instructed to find. Turtle confronts Eastman, confirming his identity as Sandy/Westing, and becomes his protege and heir.
