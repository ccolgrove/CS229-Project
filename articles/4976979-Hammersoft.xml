== Audio and video content ==

Most other RTÃ-originated content such as ''[[Show Me the Money (Ireland)|Show Me the Money]]'' is also provided, but increasingly more and more content is restricted only to Ireland as the content has shifted over to the Ireland-only [[RTÃ player]]. Video streams vary between 56 and 225 kbit/s or higher and vary from RealMedia versions eight through ten. Many are direct dumps from RTÃ 1 and 2, and hence include their [[digital on-screen graphic]]s, or even ad breaks. The site was one of the first to offer audio downloads, with [[file transfer protocol|FTP]]-hosted RealAudio 2 files being provided as far back as 1996, with streaming being introduced in 1997, initially using [[Xing Streamworks]], and later moving back solely to Real.
