The '''University of Montana School of Journalism''' is located at the [[University of Montana]] in [[Missoula]], [[Montana]], and is one of the oldest [[accredited]] [[journalism]] programs in the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umt.edu/journalism/about_the_jschool/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==History==
Founded in 1914 with eight students, the school originally operated out of a number of [[army surplus]] [[tent]]s on the university grounds, then moved to a bicycle shed before finally settling in a newly-built wooden building.  The next journalism building was completed in 1936. In June 2007, the journalism program relocated again to the newly constructed Don Anderson Hall.

The program is accredited and is in partnership with the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.ku.edu/~acejmc/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Features==
