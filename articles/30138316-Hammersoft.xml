'''Poppy Meadow''', played by [[Rachel Bright]], was introduced on 11 January 2011 as the best friend of established character [[Jodie Gold]] ([[Kylie Babbington]]), and appeared in several &quot;filler&quot; scenes which were substituted for cuts made from a controversial baby-swap storyline.&lt;ref name=&quot;11jan&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= 11/01/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xh7lz |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Jennie Darnell (director), Carey Andrews (writer)|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]]|airdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;13jan&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= 13/01/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xh6xw |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Jennie Darnell (director), Carey Andrews (writer)|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poppy returned in June 2011 as a supporting character, and began working alongside Jodie as a beautician.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reasons to stay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a319136/eastenders-star-jodie-has-reasons-to-stay.html|title='EastEnders' star: 'Jodie has reasons to stay'|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=12 May 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her storylines focussed on her friendship with Jodie and their intertwined love-lives, as the two added a comedy element to the series.

He made a short return from 19 August 2011&lt;ref name=&quot;run&quot;/&gt; until 26 August 2011.

He first appears when he witnesses Whitney attempting to pickpocket a man but ending up with cuts on her face.Rob rescues her from the situation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Janine and Whitney get up to no good|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a303725/janine-and-whitney-get-up-to-no-good.html|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|work=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Daniel|last=Kilkelly|date=February 2011|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and buys her a meal. He gives her his number so she can contact him any time she needs get away, before taking her home. They stay in contact and Rob is seen showing a friend a photo of Whitney. When Whitney either rejects or is rejected by all her friends and family, she contacts Rob and he takes her to stay with him. After Whitney has been missing for several days, [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) tries to phone her, leaving several messages. When she finally gets a voicemail back, it is from Rob saying if she calls again, there will be trouble.

Lauren tracks Whitney down to [[Dartford]], but Whitney insists she is fine with Rob, and that they are in love. Rob meets Lauren at their bedsit and invites her out with them, but Lauren leaves. Rob then leaves Whitney alone with [[#Chris|Chris]] (Richard Simons) and it is revealed that Rob is using Whitney to pay off his debts. Rob meets Lauren in a cafÃ© and again invites her out and calls her beautiful. He then threatens her, saying he does not want to see her again. When Rob returns to the bedsit, Whitney is there with [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), who says she is taking Whitney home. Whitney refuses to go and Rob ejects Janine from the building. Rob then tells Whitney they are going out immediately, and drags her to the car as she refuses to go. Lauren and Janine watch as Rob drives away with Whitney. Rob takes Whitney to a house where she meets [[#Chloe|Chloe]] ([[Georgia Henshaw]]), another girl being exploited. Whitney realises she is there to have sex with men, so asks Rob if she can leave. Rob says to either be nice to his friends or he will hurt her. He grabs her and locks her in a room. She is unable to open the windows so when she hears people outside the door, she smashes a window, jumps to the ground and runs away with Rob calling after her. She then stops a car and asks for help. She later returns to Walford after being arrested for shoplifting. Her half brother [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) learns of what happened and wants to find Rob but Whitney says he has moved.

When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named [[#Lee|Lee]] (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. Whitney goes to meet Lee and is shocked to see Rob instead. She is taken in by his charm until she texts Lee not to come, and then sees the message on Rob's phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to [[Southend-on-Sea]] with friends. She leaves Rob a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall over the edge of the pier. A body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob's.

===Development===
In January 2011, it was announced that Whitney would be part of the sexual exploitation storyline. She is left alone and vulnerable, and falls for Rob, who then exploits her. ''EastEnders'' worked alongside charity [[Comic Relief]] on the storyline, which started planning in 2010. The storyline culminated during [[Red Nose Day 2011]] on 18 March 2011, in a special 10-minute episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sex explotation plot&quot;/&gt; Gilly Green, Head of UK Grants at Comic Relief, said: &quot;It is vital that we continue to alert young people to the dangers if we are to stop them being exploited and the opportunity to work with ''EastEnders'' will make a huge audience aware of this issue. We have been working with the ''EastEnders'' script writers and some of the young women from projects we support to ensure the story reflects the reality of young people caught up in sexual exploitation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/2011/01/comicrelief.shtml|title=EastEnders working with Comic Relief|last=Humphreys|first=Matt|date=9 January 2011|work=EastEnders|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Cahill, Chief Executive of Comic Relief, added &quot;We have worked over many years with ''EastEnders'' in all kinds of ways. It's been a real pleasure this year to work together on a piece of serious drama, in the best traditions of public service, which will highlight an important issue and also, because it occurs on the night of Comic Relief, actually help raise crucial funds to help young women caught up in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sex explotation plot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a296873/eastenders-confirms-sex-exploitation-plot.html|title='EastEnders' confirms sex exploitation plot|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=10 January 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=26 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An ''EastEnders'' insider spoke of the storyline leading up to Rob's arrival: &quot;Janine's a terrible influence and is soon dragging Whitney into all sorts of shady schemes. Given that Janine used to be a prostitute, it makes sense that she's part of Whitney's journey. Whitney has no idea what she's letting herself in for. Janine is only part of the problem though. It's when she meets Robâa deeply unscrupulous manâthat her life starts to fall apart in a terrifying way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The List&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/32056-eastenders-whitney-to-turn-to-prostitution/|title=EastEnders' Whitney to turn to prostitution|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|publisher=The List Ltd|date=20 January 2011|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob has been called &quot;evil&quot; by ''The People''&lt;ref name=&quot;The People&quot;/&gt; and by executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ebcar&quot;/&gt; a &quot;nasty piece of work&quot; by [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Orange&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orange.co.uk/entertainment/television/24478.htm|title=Janine to meet her match|publisher=[[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]]|accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;sinister&quot; by Daniel Kilkelly from [[Digital Spy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ebcar&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a322573/eastenders-boss-confirms-affair-plot-rumours.html|title='EastEnders' boss confirms affair plot rumours|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=1 June 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=1 June 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;vicious&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/3457207/New-EastEnders-plot-sees-Whitney-Dean-exploited-as-a-sex-slave.html|title= EastEnders plot highlights horror of sex slavery|date=10 March 2011|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News Group Newspapers]]|accessdate=8 June 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;vile&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/3433900/Ricky-Butcher-caught-in-EastEnders-vice-plot.html|title=Ricky caught in Enders vice plot|date=25 February 2011|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|accessdate=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

On 1 May 2011 it was reported by the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' that Latham would return to ''EastEnders'' in a couple of weeks time to film the conclusion to the storyline. A source said, &quot;Whitney will not be going back on the streets but the writers felt the storyline needed to be tied up so Jody is coming back for a couple of episodes. Whitney is currently having to come to terms with everything that she did while under Rob's spell and she's not coping very well. She's trying to move on but, with everyone knowing that she worked as a prostitute, she's finding it all very Â­difficult. The writers decided it would be good for her to come face to face with Rob again once she's strong enough to do so. They've written the conclusion to her storyline and Jody will be back to film the dramatic ending in a couple of weeks time. Rob is set to finally get his come-uppance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Latham returning&quot;/&gt; An ''EastEnders'' spokeperson confirmed this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Latham returning&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/188757/Evil-pimp-poised-for-return-to-Albert-Square/|title=Evil pimp poised for return to Albert Square|last=Hill|first=Susan|date=1 May 2011|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]|accessdate=1 May 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkwood said that Rob would return when Whitney is at her most vulnerable, following the reveal of her brother Ryan's affair with her best friend Lauren.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebcar&quot;/&gt; Scenes were filmed in [[Southend-on-Sea]], [[Essex]], for Rob's return, after Ryan tracks Rob down&lt;ref name=&quot;pier&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a323763/eastenders-stuntman-injured-in-pier-fall.html|title='EastEnders' stuntman injured in pier fall|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=8 June 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 June 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finds Whitney with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;f&amp;w&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2001019/EastEnders-Shona-McGarty-Ricky-Norwood-shoot-scenes-fair-prostitution-plot-comes-end.html|title=EastEnders' Shona McGarty and Ricky Norwood shoot scenes at the fair as prostitution plot comes to an end

The BBC issued a statement, saying:

{{blockquote|The ''EastEnders'' audience would have been aware of the dark situation Whitney was getting into. In the preceding episodes viewers saw Whitney feeling increasingly unwanted and unloved, with her brother and her step-mother absent, her life was taking a downward spiral. [...] It was a natural progression of Whitney's story thus far and we felt it was an important story to tell, and hopefully to raise awareness of amongst our audience. In doing so, we believe it was right to show theâalbeit unpleasantâreality of the situation faced by these girls, rather than put a gloss on it. In the episode Whitney is seen to escape and to raise the alarmâwe did not leave the audience on a cliffhanger. The menace and danger Whitney is in whilst clear is implied rather than graphic or sensationalised and is in keeping with the audience expectations of how ''EastEnders'' would tackle a tough story in a pre-watershed manner and indeed how Whitney's story has evolved over the last few years. We are conscious that Red Nose Day programming includes many different tones and themes, ranging from light comedy sketches to difficult and emotional appeal films, all of which played out around the time the ''EastEnders'' episode was scheduled to transmit. We hope that the majority of the audience would have heard the first extended warning and that the serious tone of the introduction, though truncated, pointed to the fact that the upcoming film was a gear change. It was further put into context by the presenters at the end of the piece, when they talked about the Comic Relief-funded charities working to help girls like Whitney.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a310633/bbc-defends-enders-comic-relief-episode.html|title=BBC defends 'Enders Comic Relief episode|last=Love|first=Ryan|date=23 March 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=23 March 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Speaking about how members of the public reacted to the storyline, Latham told ''[[OK!]]'', &quot;Considering Rob makes [[Phil Mitchell]] look like a field mouse, I've got to be quite grateful. I've not had a tin of baked beans chucked at me in Asda by some nice old lady. It's just a bit of banter off the public, which I relish. I've not had anyone threaten to beat me up yet, which is a plus point!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=12 April 2011|title=At home with 'EastEnders' star Jody Latham|journal=[[OK!]]|issue=771|page=56|publisher=[[Northern &amp; Shell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, she reveals that her bar was smashed up by the police and she was worried that she would lose Shenice if she did not tell the truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilkelly&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a305113/pics-enders-newcomers-martina-and-shenice.html|title=Pics: 'Enders newcomers Martina and Shenice|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=22 February 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=22 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfie bonds with Shenice, and Martina tells Kat that she has lost her bar and has nothing left, so Kat allows her them to stay. After a night out with Kat, Martina spends the day in bed. Kat later finds Shenice wearing her clothes and makeup. Kat shouts at Shenice to take the clothes off, and Shenice flinches thinking Kat is going to hit her. The next day, Shenice is caught trying to steal cigarettes from the local shop, which Kat chastises a drunken Martina for. Martina calls her daughter useless before going to bed, and Shenice tells Kat and Alfie that Martina says things she does not mean when she is drunk. The next day, Martina tells Kat that she will get some money so she and Shenice can move out and that she is back with her boyfriend. Kat and Alfie organise a birthday party for Shenice as Martina has forgotten and Shenice takes a disliking to [[Tiffany Butcher]] ([[Maisie Smith]]) as they are wearing the same outfit. Shenice has to leave half-way through the party as Martina finds a place to live, and they move out, leaving Alfie and Kat distraught. 

Kat and Alfie holiday in Spain and return with Shenice. Shenice and Tiffany become friends but Shenice becomes bored as Kat cannot take her and Tiffany out anywhere because of Kat's baby [[Tommy Moon|Tommy]]. Shenice bonds with Kat's relative [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) after helping her plant some window boxes. When Shenice is due to go back to Spain, she begs to stay in Walford and Alfie agrees.

He is mentioned in the episode broadcast on 14 March 2011 when Fatboy says his parents have split up because Ashley has lost his job. Ashley arrives in Walford two weeks later needing a place to stay. Fatboy invites him to stay with his friend [[Mercy Olubunmi]] ([[Bunmi Mojekwu]]) and her grandmother [[Grace Olubunmi]] ([[Ellen Thomas (actress)|Ellen Thomas]]), but has to sneak him in so Grace does not find out. Ashley then rents a room at the local bed and breakfast, run by [[Kim Fox]] ([[Tameka Empson]]). He asks Fatboy for money, saying he has a job interview out of town, but spends it on alcohol, telling Kim that he has done a one-off job for a friend. Fatboy discovers that Ashley is simply drinking away the money he lent him, and Kim leaves, telling Ashley not to stress about the rent. Fatboy tells Ashley that he is in love with Mercy, but she has a boyfriend, so in order to help Fatboy, he reports Mercy to the border agency for having an expired visa, which Fatboy told him about. Ashley then leaves Walford and two days later the [[UK Border Agency]] talk to Mercy and make her leave the country. Before she leaves, Fatboy proposes.

'''Lydia Simmonds''', initially played by [[Margaret Tyzack]] and then by [[Heather Chasen]], is the maternal grandmother of [[Ricky Butcher|Ricky]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]).

She is first seen when Janine visits her in hospital and realises that Lydia needs somewhere to stay. Lydia says she will sell her house and go into care, then sends Janine to her house to take photos, knowing that Janine will see how valuable the house is. Janine then invites Lydia to stay with her, and Lydia refuses, so Janine says that it is what Janine's mother and Lydia's daughter, June, would have wanted, so Lydia agrees. Although Janine believes she has manipulated Lydia, Lydia reveals to her nurse that she had in fact manipulated Janine. Lydia moves in and receives a letter that Janine tries to look at. Lydia tells Janine that she knows she is only interested in her money and wants her dead, but says Janine will have a long wait. On the [[wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton]] she attends [[Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) street party but insults her great-granddaughter [[Tiffany Butcher]] ([[Maisie Smith]]) so Dot wheels her to [[The Queen Victoria]] where she watches the wedding. She is seated in front of the television, blocking everyone's view, so [[Winston (EastEnders)|Winston]] ([[Ulric Browne]]) wheels her out of the way, pulling the cable out of the television, which causes it to lose picture. Lydia then manages to sell her house and so moves her belongings into Janine's flat and removes a canvas picture of Frank from Janine's living room. Janine disapproves but is forced to let her stay permanently. Later, Lydia then patronises everyone including [[Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]), Frank's mistress when he was still married to June. After moving in some furniture, Lydia struggles to stand, insisting she does not need help from Janine and slaps her when she tries to. While Janine is out, Lydia tries to reach her pills but falls out of her wheelchair. Janine is shocked to find her on the floor when she returns, and then helps her up. Lydia is unable to have an operation and is just put on stronger medicine. Lydia tells Janine that she will be fine, but Janine finds out from doctor [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]) that she is worse than she says. Lydia bonds with Tiffany whilst she and Janine are looking after her. Janine tells Lydia that she likes having her around and wants her to stay. However, she wakes up one night saying she has seen June. She talks to Janine about her funeral and will, but Janine says she would rather have Lydia's photos of June than her money. Lydia asks to see the sun rise and hear the dawn chorus, and Janine opens the window for her. After this, Lydia quietly dies in her wheelchair and Janine is left in a state of shock.

On her first appearance, she turns up at Tanya's house unannounced, and revealing that Tanya's fiancÃ© [[Greg Jessop]] ([[Stefan Booth]]) invited her to their wedding against Tanya's wishes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cora Cross&quot; /&gt; Rainie arrives at Tanya's house and Tanya is initially unhappy at the sight of Rainie but Cora vouches for her by promising that she is now clean from drugs and her counsellor thinks Rainie should reconnect with her family. Tanya soon softens towards her mother and sister. On Tanya's hen night, Cora takes a dislike to [[Vanessa Gold]] ([[Zoe Lucker]]) after Vanessa laughs about them living on a council estate. The next day, Tanya's ex-husband [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) goes to Tanya's house after tearing their daughter [[Abi Branning]]'s ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) bridesmaid dress; Tanya does not want to see him so Cora attempts to sort him out, claiming she knows how to &quot;push his buttons&quot;. She tells Max that although the girls have his name, they are Crosses deep down. It is revealed that Rainie is staying at Cora's house. Cora then attends Tanya's wedding, and finds it amusing that [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) has kissed Greg the night before as Jane said he was kind to her when she was crying about a fight she had with Tanya when Tanya thought Jane was trying to get close to Greg. Cora says it is interesting, saying that Tanya would have ripped her eyes out if she had kissed Max when they were together. Cora departs after the wedding on 15 April, and Rainie later reveals that she has moved out of her mother's home.

Cora returns months later as she can no longer handle her abusive neighbours and asks to stay with Tanya for a few days. Tanya lets her stay longer, and on her birthday, she visits [[The Queen Victoria]] public house and meets [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) and [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]). She gets drunk and confronts Tanya about forgetting her birthday and how she treats Rainie. Cora also guesses that Tanya does not love Greg, but Tanya denies this. Cora reveals she has been evicted from her home because her neighbour has an ASBO, but when Cora, Tanya and Rainie return there to empty the house, the neighbour reveals that Cora is the one with the ASBO. She looks after Tanya's young son [[Oscar Branning]] (Charlee and Neo Hall) but he annoys her due to the noise he makes. She leaves him to play on the stairs and he falls, resulting in minor injuries.

Eventually Cora is forced to move out of Tanya's and convinces [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) to let her stay with her. She asks [[Anthony Moon]] (Matt Lapinskas) to help her move her things, saying he can keep one of her belongings as payment. He asks for her candlesticks, but she says they are the only decent thing she owns, so she lets him buy them for Â£200. She later finds out they could be worth Â£1000, so convinces Anthony's father [[Eddie Moon|Eddie]] ([[David Essex]]) to give her an extra Â£300, but he believes them to be worth Â£8000. Dot later kicks Cora out for laughing at her and using language that Dot dislikes. Cora arrives at Tanya's house just as [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) is throtling Rainie so Cora fends Shirley off and threatens her. Tanya then lets Cora stay with her. When Max returns because Abi is worried about Tanya, it leads to Lauren revealing that Tanya has cervical cancer and has stopped her treatment. Tanya explains that she did not tell anyone because of how it was for her when her father, Bill, was dying of cancer. She then tells Cora and Rainie that Bill did not die peacefully as they thought, but he was in constant pain so Tanya helped him to die. Cora is initially horrified, but after Tanya explains further the circumstances surrounding Bill's death, they reconcile. Cora then vows to support Tanya through her illness.

Norman goes to [[Pat Evans]]' ([[Pam St Clement]]) house and they recognise each other, and he mentions that he is widowed again, having been married five times. Norman's niece, [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) is angry with him because he never bothered with his mother while she was alive. A week later, Pat calls him and asks him to contest the will against Janine who is the sole beneficiary. The next day, Norman phones up Pat, and asks her to visit him in hospital after he stepped on a rake. Pat tries to persuade Norman not to contest the will after all, and he later agrees. It is clear that Norman likes Pat, but she is oblivious to this. [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) takes a liking to Norman and asks him to dress as a [[Pearly King]] to help with her campaign to stop the community centre closing. Jean hopes that she can be his Pearly Queen, but he asks Pat to do it instead, and she reluctantly agrees.

Norman asks Pat out but she rejects him, while Jean's liking of Norman intensifies. Jean agrees to go to a [[skiffle]] event with him. However, she misunderstands, as he is actually giving her both tickets and not going with her. Jean's relative [[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) confronts Norman for playing games but he insists he was never planning to go with Jean. This causes an argument between Kat, Pat and Janine, and Janine tells Norman that Pat used to be a prostitute. Norman tells Janine he is ashamed to be related to her. Jean soon becomes obsessed with Norman, constantly sending him text messages. She invites him to dinner, but he says no, saying he would not want to make a habit of it. Jean then mistakenly thinks Norman wants to live with her. He is shocked at this, and asks Kat's husband [[Alfie Moon|Alfie]] ([[Shane Richie]]) for help. Alfie makes things worse though, so Norman is forced to tell Jean that they should just be friends, as he feels she is too good for him.

When Pat discovers that her son, [[Simon Wicks]], who lives in New Zealand, is going to lose his home, she fails to get a loan because of her age. Norman offers to help and organises a loan for her. After speaking to her great grandson [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]), Pat decides she likes Norman and they kiss, she also asks him to stay. However, the next day Norman tells [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) that he regularly earns commission for organising loans for people. Patrick then warns Pat about this, and once Pat finds out that the terms of the loan mean if she misses a payment she could lose her house, she rejects Norman, tells him to leave and says she never wants to see him again. 

[[Digital Spy]] reported that &quot;sparks fly&quot; when Norman runs into Pat Evans and he develops a soft spot for her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; The character and casting were announced on 12 June 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; Norman is described as &quot;hapless, clumsy and unlucky in life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman&quot;/&gt; Of his casting, Layton said &quot;I am thrilled to be joining such a wonderful cast and crewâNorman is a great part and I'm excited to play him.

'''Rose Elizabeth Cotton''' (nÃ©e '''Colwell'''; previously '''Taylor''' and '''Beauchamp'''), played by [[Polly Perkins (singer)|Polly Perkins]], is the estranged half sister of [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]). She is first seen when Dot goes to visit her in [[Southend-on-Sea]] where she lives, as she has decided to make amends before she dies. Dot sees Rose in a bar, drinking and flirting with a group of men, and leaves without speaking to her. She later follows her to an address, and Rose lies that she is well off and her husband has died. Dot leaves but returns when she realises she has left something behind. She finds that the dead man is alive and Rose has lied about everything. Dot goes to her actual home and Rose admits she did not want Dot to think bad of her. Dot tells Rose she may not have long to live and did not want to die before making amends. They start to bond, and Dot meets Rose's son [[#Andrew Cotton|Andrew]] ([[Ricky Grover]]), and there is animosity between mother and son. Before Dot is due to leave, Rose asks to spend some more time with her. Dot says as they are both lonely, Rose should live with her in [[Walford]], and Rose agrees. Andrew drives them there but reveals his last name is Cotton, and Rose is forced to admit that Andrew's father is Dot's first husband [[Charlie Cotton]], who had a bigamous marriage with Rose. Dot kicks Rose out but she later returns, saying she does not want to lose her sister again.

Rose moves in and Dot urges her to earn money. When Dot gossips to her about [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) and her family, Rose uses this information to make Jean think she is psychic, and Jean pays her for her services. She then gets a trial working for Doctor [[Yusef Khan]] ([[Ace Bhatti]]) as his receptionist. She gets the job and appears to enjoy it, although her constant pining over Yusef appears to irritate him somewhat. Rose reveals to Dot that she is behind with the paperwork at the surgery while Yusef has been away. Dot helps Rose sort through her workload, but they discover that Rose has misplaced some test results for a patient who has since died. Rose fears her oversight resulted in the patient's death, but [[Reverend Stevens]] ([[Michael Keating (actor)|Michael Keating]]) tells her the patient died of a bee sting. A relieved Rose then flirts with Reverend Stevens, much to the chagrin of Dot. A few days later, Dot reveals Rose's shady past to Reverend Stevens. However, the Reverend is intrigued, and he and Rose share a drink at [[The Queen Victoria]] public house, as he wants to know more about her life. Rose brings alcohol to a church social event, which Dot is against, but Reverend Stevens thanks Dot for making it the best so far. Rose and Reverend Stevens grow closer at the event, resulting in him asking for Dot's blessing to date Rose. Rose later sleeps with [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) upsetting Reverend Stevens. Cora finds this funny but Dot kicks Cora out for laughing. Rose later apologises to Dot for embarrassing her and forgives Dot for the things she said, however, Dot asks Rose to move back to Southend. Dot also discovers Rose's passport which reveals Rose had remarried again and had the surname of Beauchamp. When Dot confronts her, Rose reveals that the marriage was abusive. Dot then allows Rose to move back in with her.

is the daughter of [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliot]]) and [[Amira Shah]] ([[Preeya Kalidas]]). Yasmin is mentioned in two extra scenes available on [[BBC Online]] and [[BBC Red Button]], called ''Amira's Secret'', on 6 and 8 September 2011, when Amira reveals that no man will want her anymore, as she has Yasmin. Yasmin appears in the second scene.

However, Amira reveals that she wants Syed to meet his daughter. Yusef tries to persuade her she is doing the wrong thing and that Syed will want custody of Yasmin. Amira turns up at Syed and Christian's engagement party and tells Syed he has a daughter. Amira explains she does not want Christian anywhere near Yasmin, but Syed refuses to see his daughter without Christian. However, he later meets up with Amira and Yasmin in the park. Amira tries to manipulate Syed into spending more time with her and Yasmin. Amira lies, saying that Yasmin has swallowed her ring, leading to Yasmin going for an unnecessary trip to the hospital.

Yusef, trying to tear the Masood family apart, tells Christian that Syed may not be Yasmin's father. Christian goes behind Syed's back to have a paternity test done, taking a hair from each of them. However, Yusef, who is the local GP, swaps Syed's hair sample for one of his own. The test results then appear to show that Syed is not Yasmin's father, causing consternation for those involved, though Yusef's falsification is subsequently exposed.
