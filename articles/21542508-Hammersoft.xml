The '''Florida Gators women's gymnastics''' team represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[artistic gymnastics|gymnastics]].  The team competes in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  The Gators host their home matches in the [[O'Connell Center]] on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus, and are currently led by head coach [[Rhonda Faehn]].  In the thirty-eight-year history of the Gators women's gymnastics program, the team has won seven SEC championships and the 1982 [[AIAW]] national tournament championship.

== History ==

The University of Florida first fielded a women's varsity gymnastics team in the fall of 1973.  Gymnastics was one of the first women's sports added at the University of Florida and achieved early success winning the 1982 [[AIAW]] Championship.  Since the NCAA assumed sponsorship for women's sports championships in 1982, Florida has advanced to the National Championships (Top 12) fifteen times, and has advanced to the Super Six ten times.  Florida's highest finish in NCAA competition was a runner-up (second place) finish in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Dooley, &quot;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090601/ARTICLES/906019924  Top 25 Gator teams: #24 1998 Gymnastics],&quot; ''Gainesville Sun'' (June 1, 2009).  Retrieved August 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gators are coached by [[Rhonda Faehn]] and finished fourth at the 2006 NCAA Championships.
