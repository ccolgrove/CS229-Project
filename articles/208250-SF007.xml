'''John the Ripper''' is a [[free software|free]] [[password cracking]] software tool. Initially developed for the [[Unix|UNIX]] [[operating system]], it currently runs on fifteen different platforms (11 architecture-specific flavors of Unix, [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Win32]], [[BeOS]], and [[OpenVMS]]). It is one of the most popular password testing/breaking programs as it combines a number of password crackers into one package, [[Autodetection|autodetects]] password hash types, and includes a customizable cracker. It can be run against various [[encryption|encrypted]] password formats including several [[Crypt (Unix)|crypt]] password hash types most commonly found on various Unix flavors (based on [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], [[MD5]], or [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]]), [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] [[Andrew File System|AFS]], and Windows NT/2000/XP/2003 [[LM hash]]. Additional modules have extended its ability to include [[MD4]]-based password hashes and passwords stored in [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], [[MySQL]], and others.

== Sample output ==
Here is a sample output in a [[Debian]] environment.

 root@0[john-1.6.37]# '''cat pass.txt'''
 user:AZl.zWwxIh15Q
 root@0[john-1.6.37]# '''john -w:password.lst pass.txt'''
 Loaded 1 password hash (Traditional DES [24/32 4K])
 example         (user)
 guesses: 1  time: 0:00:00:00 100%  c/s: 752  trying: 12345 - pookie

== Attack types ==
One of the modes John can use is the [[dictionary attack]]. It takes text string samples (usually from a file, called a ''wordlist'', containing words found in a [[dictionary]]), encrypting it in the same format as the password being examined (including both the encryption algorithm and key), and comparing the output to the encrypted string. It can also perform a variety of alterations to the dictionary words and try these.  Many of these alterations are also used in John's single attack mode, which modifies an associated plaintext (such as a username with an encrypted password) and checks the variations against the encrypted hashes.

John also offers a [[brute force attack|brute force]] mode. In this type of attack, the program goes through all the possible plaintexts, hashing each one and comparing it to the input [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]]. John uses character frequency tables to try plaintexts containing more frequently-used characters first. This method is useful for cracking passwords which do not appear in dictionary wordlists, but it does take a long time to  run.
