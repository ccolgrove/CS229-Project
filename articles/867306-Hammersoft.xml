'''Stonyhurst College''' is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[independent school]], adhering to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] tradition.&lt;ref name=ISBI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jesuit_org/&gt; It is located on the [[Stonyhurst|Stonyhurst Estate]] near the village of [[Hurst Green, Lancashire|Hurst Green]] in the [[Ribble Valley]] area of [[Lancashire]], England, and occupies a [[Grade I listed]] building.&lt;ref name=Stony_3/&gt; The school has been fully co-educational since 1999. 

The college was founded in 1593&lt;ref Name=Brit/&gt; by [[Robert Persons|Father Robert Persons SJ]] at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]],&lt;ref name=cathrob/&gt; at a time when [[penal laws]] prohibited Catholic education in England. After moving to [[Bruges]] in 1762 and [[LiÃ¨ge (city)|LiÃ¨ge]] in 1773, the college moved to England and located at Stonyhurst Hall in 1794.&lt;ref Name=Brit/&gt;&lt;ref name=cathrob/&gt; Today it provides boarding and day education to approximately 450 boys and girls aged 13â18.&lt;ref name=IndSch_1/&gt; On an adjacent site, its [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]], [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall|St Mary's Hall]], provides education for boys and girls aged 3â13.&lt;ref name=Stony_welcome/&gt;

Under the motto ''Quant Je Puis'', &quot;All that I can&quot;, the school combines an academic curriculum with extra-curricular pursuits.&lt;ref name=IndSch_Stony_2/&gt; Roman Catholicism plays a central role in college life, with emphasis on both prayer and service, according to the Jesuit philosophy of creating &quot;Men and Women for Others&quot;.&lt;ref name=spiritual_1/&gt;

The earliest deed concerning the &quot;Stanihurst&quot; is held in the college's Arundell Library; it dates from approximately 1200. In 1372, a license was granted to John de Bayley for an oratory on the site.&lt;ref name=Stony_7/&gt; His descendants, the Shireburn family, completed the oldest portion of the extant buildings.&lt;ref name=Stony_6/&gt; Richard Shireburn began building the hall, which was enlarged by his grandson Nicholas who also constructed the ponds, avenue and gardens.&lt;ref name=handbook36/&gt; Following his death, the estate passed to his wife and then to their sole heir, Mary, the Duchess of Norfolk. In 1754, it was inherited by her cousin [[Lulworth Castle|Thomas Weld]] of [[Lulworth]].&lt;ref name=Stony_8/&gt; A former pupil of the school from its years in LiÃ¨ge, he donated the buildings, with {{convert|30|acre|m2}} of land, in 1794 to the [[Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Hewitson/&gt;

===The college===

[[Image:Robert Persons.gif|thumb|right|[[Robert Persons|Fr Robert Persons SJ]]]]

The story of the school starts at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] in what was then the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in 1593, where a college, under the Royal Patronage of [[Philip II of Spain]], was founded by [[Robert Parsons (Jesuit)|Fr Robert Persons SJ]] for English boys unable to receive a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] education in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan England]].&lt;ref name=cathrob/&gt; As such it was one of a number of expatriate English schools operating on the European mainland.&lt;ref name=cathrob/&gt; In 1762, the Jesuits were forced to flee and re-established their school at [[Bruges]].&lt;ref name=Hewitson/&gt; The school was moved in 1773 to [[LiÃ¨ge (city)|LiÃ¨ge]], where it operated for two decades before moving to [[Stonyhurst]] on 29 August 1794.  Schooling resumed on Wednesday 22 October of the same year.&lt;ref name=Stony_9/&gt;

The college flourished during the 19th century: the Society of Jesus was re-established in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] at Stonyhurst in 1803,&lt;ref name=handbook36/&gt; and over the century, student numbers rose from the original twelve migrants from LiÃ¨ge.&lt;ref name=Stony_10/&gt; By the turn of the following century, it had become England's largest Catholic college.&lt;ref name=New_Advent_1/&gt; Stonyhurst Hall underwent extensive alterations and additions to accommodate these numbers; the Old South Front was constructed in 1810, only to be demolished and replaced with much grander buildings in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=TEM_195/&gt; A seminary was constructed on the [[Stonyhurst|estate]], and an observatory and meteorological station erected in the gardens.&lt;ref name=handbook36/&gt; The 20th century saw the gradual hiring of a mostly lay staff, as the number of Jesuits declined.&lt;ref name=TEM_164/&gt; The seminary at St Mary's Hall was closed, and the school discontinued its education of university-aged philosophers. With the closure of [[Beaumont College]] in 1967, Stonyhurst became the sole Jesuit public school in England.

Since the [[Second World War]], the buildings have been refurbished or developed. Additions include new science buildings in the 1950s and 1960s, a new boarding wing in the 1960s, a new swimming pool in the 1980s and Weld House in 2010. The school became fully co-educational in 1999.&lt;ref name=TEM_178/&gt;

==Hodder Place, St Mary's Hall &amp; Hodder House==

[[Image:St Mary's Hall Stonyhurst.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Mary's Hall]]
The original preparatory school to Stonyhurst, [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall#Hodder Place|Hodder Place]], came into the hands of the Jesuits as part of the estate donated by alumnus Thomas Weld.&lt;ref name=legacies/&gt; Originally used as a [[novitiate]], it became a preparatory school to the college in 1807.&lt;ref name=handbook36/&gt;

[[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall|St Mary's Hall]], on an adjoining site to Stonyhurst, was built as a Jesuit Seminary in 1828 (extended in the 1850s) and functioned until 1926, when the seminarians moved to [[Heythrop College|Heythrop Hall]].&lt;ref name=Hewitson/&gt; The poet [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], and John Tolkien, son of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], trained as priests there.&lt;ref name=TEM_140/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC_Tolkien/&gt; During [[World War II]], the [[English College]] left [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italy and occupied the hall. After their return to [[Rome]], St Mary's Hall opened as a middle school in 1946.&lt;ref name=Stonyhurst_College_1963_p.38/&gt; At the same time, Hodder Place continued to educate those aged eight to eleven, until its closure and conversion into flats in 1970. Hodder Place pupils moved up to St Mary's Hall to form Hodder Playroom.&lt;ref name=TEM_194/&gt; As successor to Hodder Place, St Mary's Hall has a claim to be the oldest surviving preparatory school in Britain.&lt;ref name=Saint_Marys_Hall/&gt;

In 2004, the old gymnasium at St Mary's Hall was converted into new nursery and infant facilities named [[Stonyhurst Saint Mary's Hall#Hodder Place|Hodder House]], for those aged three to seven.&lt;ref name=TEM_181/&gt;

==Religious life==
[[Image:Lady Statue Stonyhurst.jpg|thumb|The Lady Statue at the top of the Avenue, erected in 1882]]

{{Main|Religious life at Stonyhurst College}}

The college is [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and has had a significant place in English Catholic history for many centuries (including controversial events such as the [[Popish Plot]] and [[Gunpowder Plot]] conspiracies).&lt;ref name=TEM41-54/&gt; It was founded initially to educate English Catholics on the continent in the hope that, through them, Catholicism might be restored in England.&lt;ref name=TEM41-54/&gt; Finally, the school settled in England in 1794 and  the [[Society of Jesus]] was officially re-established in Britain in 1803.&lt;ref name=handbook36/&gt; Stonyhurst remained the headquarters of the English Province until the middle of the century; by 1851, a third of the Province's Jesuits were based there.&lt;ref name=TEM_140/&gt;

Until the 1920s, Jesuit priests were trained on site in what is today the preparatory school. There was a drop in vocations after [[World War I]] and the seminary was closed. The number of Jesuits teaching at Stonyhurst fell to a third of the staff within a decade.&lt;ref name=TEM_152/&gt; Since then, the Jesuit presence has been in decline, but the school continues to place Catholicism and Jesuit philosophy at its core under the guidance of a Jesuit-led chaplaincy team and the involvement of the Jesuits in its governance.&lt;ref name=spiritual_1/&gt;

===Jesuit ethos===
[[Image:St Peter's Church, Stonyhurst.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of St Peter's Church]]

The Jesuit educational ethos consists chiefly of seven strands:&lt;ref name=Jesuit_2/&gt;
*Finding God in All Things;
*Caring for the individual;
*Showing love in deeds;
*Building Christian community;
*Engaging with the wider world;
*Encouraging excellence; and
*Co-operating in Jesuit mission.

Under these guiding principles, the college strives for the formation of well-rounded individuals, influenced by [[Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatian]] reasoning and spirituality, and concern for humankind: the development of &quot;Men and Women for Others&quot;.&lt;ref name=spiritual_2/&gt;

[[Image:College Chapel windows.jpg|thumb|right|Boys' Chapel windows.]]

===Chapels===
The school has one main church, St Peter's, and five chapels: the Boys' Chapel, the Chapel of the Angels, the Sodality Chapel, the [[Aloysius Gonzaga|St Aloysius]] Chapel and the [[Ignatius of Loyola|St Ignatius]] Chapel.&lt;ref name=Hewitson_2/&gt;  The last two are both within the towers of St Peter's Church, and are not normally used by pupils.

The Sodality Chapel is the home of the remains of the 3rd century Roman convert [[Gordianus and Epimachus|St Gordianus]].&lt;ref name=Stony_11/&gt; The Jesuits brought his remains from the [[College of St Omer]] and held them beneath the altar since 1859. His bones were temporarily removed in 2006 whilst the chapel underwent restoration, but they have since been returned.&lt;ref name=Stony_12/&gt; The chapel is again used by the re-established [[Sodality]].

Adjacent to the Old Infirmary is the Rosary Garden, a place for spiritual contemplation, at the centre of which is a stone statue of Mary.&lt;ref name=Stony_13/&gt;

St Peter's Church underwent extensive repair and refurbishment in 2010-11. Most of the Victorian stencilling was not restored, although the whitewash was removed from the stencilling above the altar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cassidyashton.co.uk/portfolio/65/St-Peter-s-Church-Stonyhurst.htm] Refurbishment of St Peters. Retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditions===
It is a long-standing practice that pupils write '''[[Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam|A.M.D.G.]]''' in the top left hand corner of any piece of work they do. It stands for the Latin phrase ''Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam'' which means ''For the Greater Glory of God''. At the end of a piece of work they write '''L.D.S.''' in the centre of the page. It stands for ''Laus Deo Semper'' which means ''Praise to God Always''. These are both traditional Jesuit mottoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090804232637/http://geocities.com/TheTropics/7177/amdg.htm AMDG] Information on the Jesuit motto AMDG.

A distinguishing feature of Stonyhurst is the singing of the ''[[Pater Noster]]'', the &quot;Lord's Prayer&quot; in [[Latin]]. It is sung at mass, and has been adopted as an anthem by the school's sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonyhurst.ac.uk/article_1204.shtml Pater Noster] Pater Noster mentioned in the Stonyhurst Association President's speech, May 2008.

Education during the college's early history was based on [[Ignatius of Loyola|St Ignatius']] ''[[Ratio Studiorum]]'', with emphasis upon theology, classics and science, all of which still feature prominently in the curriculum.&lt;ref name=TEM_25-39/&gt; The educational practice, observed at the [[College of St Omer]], of dividing a class into Romans and Carthaginians continued long after the migration to Stonyhurst but is not employed today; each pupil would be pitched against an opponent with the task of picking up on the other's mistakes in an attempt to score points.&lt;ref name=TEM_195/&gt;

Until Roman Catholics were admitted to [[Oxbridge]] in 1894, Stonyhurst was also home to a number of &quot;philosopher gentlemen&quot; studying BA courses under the London Matriculation Examination system. Their numbers began to fall after 1894 and the department was closed in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Muir, ''Stonyhurst'', (St Omers Press, Gloucestershire.

===Playroom system===

Currently, the College has the following playrooms, following the Roman order of learning:

* Lower Grammar Playroom ('LG' 13-14)
* Grammar Playroom (14-15)
* Syntax Playroom (15-16, GCSE Year)
* Poetry Playroom (16-17)
* Rhetoric Playroom (17-18)

During the school's history the following playrooms or years have also existed:

* Philosophy ('Phils')
* Upper Syntax
* Humanities
* Upper Grammar
* Middle Grammar

===Lines===
In addition to the horizontal division of the school into playrooms, there is also a vertical grouping which cuts through the year groups, the &quot;lines&quot;, and is used mostly for competitive purposes in sport and music.&lt;ref&gt;TT.E. Muir, ''Stonyhurst'', (St Omers Press, Gloucestershire. Second edition, 2006) ISBN 0-9553592-0-1 p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The Lines and colours are as follows:
* '''Campion''' (Red) (named after [[Edmund Campion|St Edmund Campion]])
* '''St Omers''' (Yellow, though Brown for sporting attire) (named after [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]], the town the school was founded in)
* '''Shireburn''' (Green) (named after the Shireburn family which built Stonyhurst)
* '''Weld''' (Blue) (named after Thomas Weld who donated Stonyhurst to the Jesuits)
