'''APP''' is an abbreviation for [[Application software|application]]. The filename extension &lt;tt&gt;.app&lt;/tt&gt; means application in [[Symbian OS]], [[SkyOS]], [[GNUstep]] and [[Mac OS X]].
On the latter two systems, a &lt;tt&gt;.app&lt;/tt&gt; file is actually a [[Folder (computing)|folder]] containing binaries and supporting files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFBundles/AboutBundles/AboutBundles.html About Bundles], Mac OS X Reference Library, Apple Developer Center&lt;/ref&gt;

'''App''' may also refer to a lightweight application, tailored to a device's form factor and input-output interfaces (key pad, touch pad, remote control, display, etc).  Devices may include such things as a mobile phone, a TV set, a cable or satellite receiver, a tablet PC, a printer - any device whose features can be extended through software.
