Notre Dame's nickname is inherited from Irish immigrant soldiers who fought in the Civil War with the Union's [[Irish Brigade (U.S.)|Irish Brigade]], (consisting of the 69th NY, 63rd NY, 88th NY, 116th Pennsylvania, and 28th Mass. Infantry Regiments), recollected among other places in the poetry of [[Joyce Kilmer]] who served with one of the Irish Brigade regiments during World War I. Though the Irish regiments and Kilmer were well-known, particularly in the urban ethnic community, during the era between the Civil War and World War II, Notre Dame's claim to the nickname is justified since its third president was a famous Irish Brigade chaplain whose ministrations at Gettysburg are commemorated in the &quot;Absolution Under Fire,&quot; part of Notre Dame's permanent art collection. This chaplain's name was Fr. William Corby. There are two identical monuments dedicated to him, one is on the battlefield at the Gettysburg National Military Park, and the other is on the campus of Notre Dame.

Notre Dame athletic teams are known as the ''Fighting Irish'' (though students are called &quot;Domers&quot;). Previously, and especially during the [[Knute Rockne]] football era, Notre Dame had several unofficial nicknames&amp;mdash;among them the &quot;Rovers&quot; and the &quot;Ramblers,&quot; because of those teams' propensity to travel the nation to play its football contests, such as at the University of Southern California, long before such national travel became the collegiate norm. Later, Notre Dame was also, again unofficially, known as the &quot;Terriers,&quot; after the Irish breed of the dog, and for some years, an [[Irish Terrier]] would be found on the ND football sidelines.

According to the University's website, there are several legends of how Notre Dame came to be the &quot;Fighting Irish.&quot; One story suggests the moniker was born in 1899 (much earlier than the &quot;modern era&quot;) with Notre Dame leading [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]] 5-0 at halftime of a game in [[Evanston, Illinois]]. The Wildcat fans began to chant, &quot;Kill the Fighting Irish, kill the Fighting Irish,&quot; as the second half opened. Another tale has the nickname originating at halftime of the Notre Dame-[[University of Michigan|Michigan]] game in 1909. With his team trailing, one Notre Dame player yelled to his teammates&amp;mdash;who had names like Dolan, Kelly, Donnelly, Glynn, Duffy and Ryan&amp;mdash;&quot;What's the matter with you guys? You're all Irish and you're not fighting worth a lick.&quot; Notre Dame came back to win the game and the press, after overhearing the remark, reported the game as a victory for the &quot;Fighting Irish.&quot; Another possible origin is the violent 1924 confrontation between Notre Dame Students and faculty and the anti-Catholic [[Ku Klux Klan]] in South Bend. This event is described in Todd Tucker's book ''Notre Dame Vs. the Klan: How the Fighting Irish Defeated the Ku Klux Klan''.

The most generally accepted explanation is {{Fact|date=March 2007}} that the press coined the nickname as a characterization of Notre Dame teams in the 1920s as a result of preexisting Irish stereotypes, the widely reported events of 1924 (although after their 10â7 loss to [[1921 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]], Notre Dame was referred to as the &quot;Irish&quot; in a newspaper article about the game), and the grit, determination, and tenacity of Coach Knute Rockne's football teams of the era. Although Notre Dame alumnus Francis Wallace popularized it in his ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columns in the 1920s with respect to the university, as early as the Civil War Father Corby and the Irish Brigade of the Union Army had been dubbed &quot;The Fighting Irish.&quot;{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Conference==
Notre Dame is a member of the [[Big East Conference]] in all sports except for the following:
*Football, in which it maintains its status as one of a handful of [[NCAA Division I-A independent schools|Division I-A Independents]].
*Men's [[ice hockey|hockey]], also not sponsored by the Big East, competes in the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]].
*Men's and women's [[fencing (sport)|fencing]], also not sponsored by the Big East, competes in the Midwest Fencing Conference.

The Big East has added men's lacrosse, starting in the 2010 season. Previously, Notre Dame men's lacrosse competed in the [[Great Western Lacrosse League]].

In 2006, Notre Dame finished third among Division I institutions in the fourth annual Collegiate Power Rankings released by the National Collegiate Scouting Association (NCSA). The Irish were seventh on the overall list that included all the top academic and athletic colleges and universities in the country at the Division I, II and III levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://und.cstv.com/genrel/080206aaa.html Notre Dame Finishes Third Among Division I institutions in National Collegiate Scouting Association Power Rankings. :: Irish athletics places seventh overall among Division I, II and III levels&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Coach Mike Brey, Notre Dame seriously considered joining the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 2003, with the decision to not proceed occurring at the &quot;11th hour.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;trib20100108&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-01-08/sports/1001070969_1_big-ten-mike-brey-preparing Mike Brey was preparing to join Big Ten in 2003 / But Notre Dame basketball coach says Irish decided against move at last minute]&quot; ''Chicago Tribune'', 8 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, the Big East's football coaches have pushed the conference to deliver an ultimatum to Notre Dame to either affiliate its football team with the Big East or leave the conference entirely, according to then-Connecticut head football coach Randy Edsall.&lt;ref name=&quot;allard20100428&quot;&gt;Allard, Marc. &quot;[http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/x43878276/UConn-Football-Edsall-discusses-draft-picks-Big-Easts-status UConn Football: Edsall discusses draft picks, Big East's status]&quot; ''Norwich Bulletin'', 28 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Such an ultimatum is speculated by some to have the potential to &quot;save&quot; the Big East, as Notre Dame would likely join the Big Ten and perhaps satisfy that conference's desire for expansion;&lt;ref name=&quot;bennett20100429&quot;&gt;Bennett, Brian. &quot;[http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/21870/coaches-want-notre-dame-ultimatum Coaches want Notre Dame ultimatum?]&quot; ESPN, 29 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the Big East would likely be &quot;all done&quot; if the Big Ten were to pull two or more teams from it.&lt;ref name=&quot;allard20100428&quot;/&gt; Notre Dame athletic director [[Jack Swarbrick]] has stated, however, that the university will only join the Big Ten if the conference severely damages the Big East by pulling teams from it; &quot;[i]n other words, if the Big Ten adds just a single member, it won't be Notre Dame.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;murphy20100503&quot;&gt;Murphy, Austin. &quot;[http://images.si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1168948/index.htm The Colossal Conference Grind-up]&quot; ''Sports Illustrated'', 3 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National championships==
Through the summer of 2010, Notre Dame has won 56 national championships since it started competing in athletics. Since the NCAA has formed, Notre Dame has recorded 26 national championships, 18 were won by men's teams, 5 by women's teams, and 4 by combined teams.

Notre Dame's championships occurred in the following sports:&lt;ref name=&quot;championships&quot;&gt;{{cite web

* Head Coach: [[Brian Kelly (coach)|Brian Kelly]]
* Stadium: [[Notre Dame Stadium]]
* National Championships: 11 (1924, 1929, 1930, 1943, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1966, 1973, 1977, 1988)

[[File:Notre-dame-stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Notre Dame Stadium]]]]
The school has a comprehensive and nationally competitive Division I athletic program, but it is most famous for its [[College football|football]] program. Notre Dame fielded its first football team in 1887. With eleven [[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|NCAA football championships]], over 800 [[College football's ten most victorious programs|all time wins]], seven [[Heisman Trophy]] winners, famous head coaches, a 73.6% winning percentage and the most consensus [[All-America]]ns of any school, Notre Dame football is one of the most storied programs both on the gridiron and college athletics in general. Recently, Notre Dame has struggled, going through several head coaches and setting the all-time bowl losing streak of nine straight with the loss to [[2006 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] in the [[2007 Sugar Bowl]] before beating [[2008 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawaii]] in the [[2008 Hawaii Bowl]]. Notre Dame is also the only team, including professional ones, in the nation with every home game being on national broadcast televison.

In addition to having the oldest university marching band in the country, the school has many rivalries in football, the most famous ones being with [[USC Trojans football|USC]], [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]], [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]], [[Army Black Knights football|Army]], [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]], and [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]]. Notre Dame played in arguably the greatest, although certainly not the most-watched (due to Notre Dame games' already having been broadcast nationally that season as many times as allowed, ABC had to relegate its broadcast to a regional one), college football game in history: the famous (or infamous) 10-10 tie against [[1966 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] at [[Spartan Stadium, East Lansing|Spartan Stadium]] on November 19, 1966. Other Notre Dame rivalries include those with [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]], [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]. Former rivalries include a very intense rivalry in the 1980s with [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] ([[Catholics vs. Convicts]]), and a rivalry with [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]], which was renewed and played on September 9, 2006, and again during the 2007 season. The football program is also known for ending the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] [[NCAA]] record winning streak of 47 games. The streak-ending game was a 7â0 victory for the Fighting Irish on November 9, 1957. Incidentally, Oklahoma's 28-21 loss to Notre Dame to open the 1953 season was the last loss before the beginning of the streak.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Notre Dame was a member of the [[Horizon League|Midwestern Collegiate Conference]] in soccer prior to joining the Big East in most sports.

Notre Dame's women's soccer team won the [[NCAA Women's Soccer Championship|National Championship]] in 1995, 2004 and 2010 and were the [[runner-up]] in 1994, 1996, 1999, 2006, and 2008.  Notre Dame is one of only three schools with multiple national titles, the others being North Carolina (20) and Portland (2).  Notre Dame also ranks second in all-time title game appearances (8) behind North Carolina (22).  ND's women's soccer program started in 1988 under coach Chris Petrucelli.  Their 1995 Big East title was the university's first in any sport.  That same year, Petrucelli's squad, under the leadership of Cindy Daws, won the program's first national title, defeating Portland 1â0.  Notre Dame's current coach, Randy Waldrum, took over the program in 1999 and has maintained the Irish's success, winning the national title in 2004 by beating UCLA 4â3 as well as capturing six Big East titles. Waldrum's 2010 squad won the school's third national title, and became the lowest ranked team to do so, beating undefeated Stanford in a 1â0 decision. Three Notre Dame players have won the [[Hermann Trophy]], given to the United States' best male and female collegiate soccer players. They are Cindy Daws (1996), [[Anne Makinen]] (2000) and [[Kerri Hanks]] (2006, 2008). Hanks is one of only four players to win the award twice. Notre Dame is also one of only two schools with three or more different Hermann Trophy recipients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Women's soccer history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.und.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/nd/sports/w-soccer/auto_pdf/08wsocmghistory|title= 2008 Women's Soccer Media Guide |accessdate= 2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
