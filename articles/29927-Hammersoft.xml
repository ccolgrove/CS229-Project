'''Texas A&amp;M University''' (often referred to as '''A&amp;M''' or '''TAMU''') is a [[coeducation]]al [[public university|public]] research [[university]] located in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]] (USA). It is the [[Flagship campus|flagship]] institution of the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]]. The sixth-largest university in the United States, A&amp;M's enrollment for Fall 2011 was over 50,000 for the first time in school history. &lt;ref name=&quot;Enrollment Surpasses 50,000 For First Time In History&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|title=Enrollment Surpasses 50,000 For First Time In History|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|url=http://tamutimes.tamu.edu/2011/09/06/enrollment-surpasses-50000-for-first-time-in-history/|accessdate=2011-09-10|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Texas A&amp;M's designation as a [[land-grant university|land]], [[sea grant colleges|sea]], and [[space grant colleges|space grant]] institution reflects a broad range of research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), the [[National Institutes of Health]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[Office of Naval Research]]. The school ranks in the top 20 American research institutes in terms of funding and has made notable contributions to such fields as [[animal cloning]] and [[petroleum engineering]].

The first public institution of higher education in Texas, the school opened on October 4, 1876&lt;ref name=&quot;Texas A&amp;M University Fact Sheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marcomm.tamu.edu/documents/tamuFacts.pdf|format=PDF|title =Texas A&amp;M University Facts|accessdate =2008-09-03|publisher =Texas A&amp;M University}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the [[History of Texas A&amp;M University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas]].  Its original mission was to educate males in farming and military techniques.  Under the leadership of President [[James Earl Rudder]], in the 1960s A&amp;M desegregated, became coeducational, and dropped the requirement for participation in the [[Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]].  To reflect the institution's expanded roles and academic offerings, the [[Texas Legislature]] renamed the school to Texas A&amp;M University in 1963.  The letters &quot;A&amp;M,&quot; originally short for &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical,&quot; are retained only as a link to the university's past.  The school's students, [[alumnus|alumni]]&lt;!--&quot;alumni&quot; INCLUDES former, not just graduates--&gt;, and sports teams are known as &quot;[[Aggie#Schools|Aggies]]&quot;.

The main campus is one of the largest in America, spanning {{convert|5500|acre|km2|0|sp=us}},&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMUCatalog&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMUfacts&quot;/&gt; and includes the [[George Bush Presidential Library]].  Approximately one-fifth of the student body lives on campus.   Texas A&amp;M has approximately 800 officially recognized student organizations.  Many students also observe the [[traditions of Texas A&amp;M University]], which govern daily life as well as special occasions, including sports events.  Varsity Aggie sports teams compete in the [[Big 12 Conference]]. However in July 2012, the school will join the [[Southeastern Conference]]. A&amp;M operates two branches: [[Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar|Texas A&amp;M at Qatar]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston]]. Working with agencies such as the [[Texas AgriLife Research]] and [[Texas AgriLife Extension Service]], Texas A&amp;M has a direct presence in each of the 254 counties in Texas. The university offers degrees in over 150 courses of study through ten colleges and houses 18 research institutes. Texas A&amp;M has awarded over 320,000 degrees, including 70,000 graduate and professional degrees.&lt;!--The degree count is 320,000. Former student count is 280,000. Some students have multiple degrees (e.g. multiple undergrad degrees, Master's degree, etc.--&gt;

As a [[Senior Military College]], Texas A&amp;M is one of three public universities with a full-time, volunteer Corps of Cadets. It provides more commissioned officers to the [[Military of the United States|United States Armed Forces]] than any other school outside of the [[United States Service academies|service academies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush Commencement Notes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/6161585.html|title=Bush urges A&amp;M grads to consider a life of service|last=Kever|first=Jeannie|publisher=Houston Chronicle|date=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beginning years ===
The [[U.S. Congress]] laid the groundwork for the establishment of Texas A&amp;M in 1862 with the adoption of the [[Morrill Act]]. The act auctioned land grants of public lands to establish endowments for colleges where the &quot;leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts... to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;  In 1871, the [[Texas Legislature]] used these funds to establish the state's first public institution of higher education,&lt;ref name=&quot;txconstitution&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|title=The Texas Constitution, Article 7 - Education, Section 13 - Agricultural and Mechanical College|publisher=State of Texas|url=http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001300.html|accessdate=2007-08-06|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610143937/http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001300.html |archivedate = June 10, 2007|deadurl=yes|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, then known as Texas A.M.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;  [[Brazos County]] donated {{convert|2416|acre|km2|0|sp=us}} near [[Bryan, Texas]] for the school's campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|title=Texas A&amp;M University|work=[[Handbook of Texas]]|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct8.html|accessdate=2007-03-22|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes began on October 4, 1876, with 40 students and 6 faculty members.  Admission was limited to white males, and all students were required to participate in the [[Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets|Corps of Cadets]] and receive military training.&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff1617&quot;&gt;{{Cite document| last = Dethloff | first = Henry C.|authorlink=Henry C.

In the late 1880s, many Texas residents saw no need for two colleges in Texas and clamored for an end of Texas A.M.C. In 1891, Texas A&amp;M was saved from potential closure by its new president [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross]], former [[governor of Texas]], and well-respected [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Brigadier General]]. Ross made many improvements to the school and enrollment doubled to 467 cadets as parents sent their sons to Texas A&amp;M &quot;to learn to be like Ross&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ferrell|first=Christopher|title=Ross Elevated College from &quot;Reform School&quot;|newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle|year=2001|url=http://209.189.226.235/aandmnews/anniversary/1rossbio.htm|accessdate=2007-03-22|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his tenure, many enduring [[Traditions of Texas A&amp;M University|Aggie traditions]] were born, including the creation of the first [[Traditions of texas a&amp;m#Aggie Ring|Aggie Ring]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;/&gt; After his death in 1898, a statue was erected in front of what is now Academic Plaza to honor Ross and his achievements in the history of the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;ferrell&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferrell|first=Christopher|title=Ross Elevated College from &quot;Reform School&quot;|publisher=The Bryan-College Station Eagle|year=2001|url=http://209.189.226.235/aandmnews/anniversary/1rossbio.htm|accessdate=2007-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under pressure from the legislature, in 1911 the school began allowing women to attend classes during the summer semester.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last=Kavanagh | first=Colleen | title=Questioning Tradition | newspaper=The Bryan-College Station Eagle | year=2001 | url=http://theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1questioningtradition.htm | accessdate=2008-06-24 | format= â &lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AKavanagh+intitle%3AQuestioning+Tradition&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2001&amp;as_yhi=2001&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt;|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041226171757/http://theeagle.com/aandmnews/anniversary/1questioningtradition.htm |archivedate = December 26, 2004|deadurl=yes | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, A&amp;M began expanding its academic pursuits with the establishment of the [[Texas A&amp;M College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences|School of Veterinary Medicine]] in 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

=== World Wars era ===
Many Texas A&amp;M graduates served during [[World War I|World&amp;nbsp;War&amp;nbsp;I]]. By 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, more than any other school.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; In early September 1918, the entire senior class enlisted, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of the seniors were fighting in France when the war ended two months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;liffick&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Liffick|first=Brandie|title=Tradition spanning generations|newspaper=The Battalion|date=2001-10-30|url=http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2001/10/03/Ams125th/Tradition.Spanning.Generations-515912.shtml|accessdate=2007-03-22|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over 1,200&amp;nbsp;former students served as commissioned officers. After the war, Texas A&amp;M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;  The first graduate school was organized in 1924 and the school awarded its first Ph.D. in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; In 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female to receive a diploma from Texas A&amp;M, although she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony.&lt;ref name=&quot;crawford&quot;&gt;{{Cite document | title=THE TEXAS A&amp;M FOUNDATION MAGAZINE &amp;#124; SPRING 2010 | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Foundation | url=http://giving.tamu.edu/PDFs/Spring10_Spirit.pdf | accessdate=2011-02-16 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following month the Board of Directors officially prohibited all women from enrolling.&lt;ref name=&quot;kavanagh&quot;/&gt;

Many Aggies again served in the military during [[World War II]], with the college producing 20,229 combat troops. Of those, 14,123 Aggies served as officers, more than any other school and more than the combined total of the [[United States Naval Academy]] and the [[United States Military Academy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adams160&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams Jr.|first=John A.|title=Keepers of the Spirit|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=2001|pages=160, 163|isbn=1-58544-127-9|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, 29 A&amp;M graduates reached the rank of general.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt;

=== University era ===
On March 26, 1960, [[Major General]] [[James Earl Rudder]], class of 1932, became the 16th president of the college.&lt;ref name=&quot;dethloff184&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|last=Dethloff|first=Henry C.|title=A Pictorial History of Texas A&amp;M University, 1876-1976|place=[[College Station, Texas]]|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press|year=1975|page=184|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudder's tenure (1959â1970) marked a critical turning point in the school's history. Under his leadership, Texas A&amp;M underwent a dramatic expansion in terms of its physical plant construction, but more importantly, it diversified and expanded its student body by admitting women and minorities. The Corps of Cadets became voluntary. In the face of growing student activism during the 1960s, Rudder worked diligently to ensure that school continue to fulfill its mission of providing a quality education for all Aggies. By his death in 1970, Rudder had overseen the growth of the school from 7,500 to 14,000 students from all 50 states and 75 nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|last=Ferrell|first=Christopher|coauthors=|title=Rudder's influence is evident on campus|work=|pages=|language=|publisher=The Bryan-College Station Eagle|year=2001|url=http://209.189.226.235/aandmnews/anniversary/1rudderbio.htm|accessdate=2009-06-29|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher B. Bean, &quot;James Earl Rudder and the Transformation of Texas A&amp;M University,&quot; ''Journal of South Texas'' (Fall 2008), Vol. 21 Issue 2, pp 119-31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the 58th [[Legislature of Texas]] approved of Rudder's changes, and officially renamed the school &quot;Texas A&amp;M University&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;rudder&quot;/&gt; specifying that the &quot;A&quot; and the &quot;M&quot; were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;handbook&quot;/&gt; In the following 35&amp;nbsp;years, Texas A&amp;M more than tripled its enrollment from 14,000&amp;nbsp;&lt;!--Measurement of population--&gt;students to over 45,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAMUfacts&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|title=About Texas A&amp;M University|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|url=http://www.tamu.edu/home/aboutam/|accessdate=2008-02-20|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the legislative work allowing the expansion of Texas A&amp;M and the admission of women was pushed by [[Texas State Senate|State Senator]] [[William T. Moore (Texas politician)|William T. &quot;Bill&quot; Moore]], who served from 1949 to 1981. Known as &quot;the Bull of the Brazos&quot; and &quot;the father of the modern Texas A&amp;M University&quot;, Moore was a Bryan attorney and businessman originally from [[Wheelock, Texas|Wheelock]] in [[Robertson County, Texas|Robertson County]]. He also taught economics at TAMU prior to his entry into World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Borden, &quot;Bull of the Brazos dies: Moore was champion of Texas A&amp;M,&quot; ''[[Bryan-College Station Eagle]]'', May 28, 1999, pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Texas A&amp;M became one of the first four universities given the designation [[sea-grant university|sea-grant]] for its achievements in [[oceanography]] and marine resources development in 1971. In 1989, the university earned the title [[space-grant college|space-grant]] by [[NASA]], to recognize its commitment to space research and participation in the Texas Space Grant Consortium.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Texas A&amp;M University|encyclopedia=Britannica|volume=1|publisher=[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/589321/Texas-A-M-University|accessdate=2007-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endowment ===
Apart from revenue received from tuition and research grants, the university, as part of the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]] (TAMUS), is partially funded from two endowments.  The smaller endowment, totaling $1.17 billion in assets, is run by the private Texas A&amp;M Foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;  A larger sum is distributed from the Texas [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF).  TAMUS holds a minority stake (one-third) in this fund; the remaining two-thirds belongs to the University of Texas system. As of 2006, the PUF ending net asset value stood at $10.3&amp;nbsp;billion; $400.7&amp;nbsp;million was distributed to the two university systems in fiscal year 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;puf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utimco.org/funds/allfunds/2006annual/puf_return.asp|title=Permanent University Fund|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=The University of Texas Investment Management Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;handbookoftexas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/PP/khp2.html|title=Permanent University Fund|accessdate=2007-05-16|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined, the total endowment for the TAMUS stands at $5.6&amp;nbsp;billion, as of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;endowment&quot;/&gt;

The annual service project allows students to give back to their community by assisting local residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;bigevent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigevent.tamu.edu/|title=The Big Event|accessdate=2007-05-15|publisher=The Big Event|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070510220954/http://bigevent.tamu.edu/ |archivedate = May 10, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization CARPOOL, a student run, [[designated driver|safe ride program]] has provided over 179,000&amp;nbsp;free&amp;nbsp;rides (as of January 2011) to Aggies unable to transport themselves home.

The Student Government Association (SGA), one of A&amp;M's largest organizations, consists of over 1,300 student members in 3 branches, 15 committees, and 4 commissions. SGA has changed little since 1972, except its relative position within the official framework of the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;StudentSenate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Government Association|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University|year=2009|url=http://sga.tamu.edu/|accessdate=2009-05-09|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080522064338/http://sga.tamu.edu/ |archivedate = May 22, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texas A&amp;M culture is a product of the university's founding as a rural military and agricultural school.  Although the school and surrounding community have grown, and military training is no longer required, the [[History of Texas A&amp;M University|school's history]] has instilled in students &quot;the idealized elements of a small-town life: community, tradition, loyalty, optimism, and unabashed sentimentality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;burka2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Burka|first=Paul|title=The Aggie Bonfire Tragedy|newspaper=[[Texas Monthly]]|date=April 2000|page=116|edition=Vol. 28, Issue 4|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' posits that Texas A&amp;M students' respect for school [[traditions]] and values is the university's greatest strength.&lt;ref name=&quot;burkaNov2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Burka|first=Paul|title=Agent of Change|newspaper=[[Texas Monthly]]|date=November 2006|pages=155â159, 250â264|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the school traditions date to the 1890s, while others have been introduced more recently.

The most visible tradition among seniors and former students is the wearing of the [[Aggie Ring]], whose design has been relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1894.&lt;ref name=&quot;kane&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kane|first=Maureen|title=Tradition sets A&amp;M aside as the oldest institution of higher learning in Texas|newspaper=[[The Battalion]]|date=October 30, 2001|url=http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2001/10/03/Ams125th/Tradition.Sets.Am.Aside.As.The.Oldest.Institution.Of.Higher.Learning.In.Texas-515916.shtml|accessdate=2007-06-30|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students may order a ring after completing 90 [[credit hours]] of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A&amp;M, or after graduation.

In keeping with the idea that all current and former students comprise a family, Aggies have created two traditions to honor members of the Aggie family who have died.  [[Muster (Texas A&amp;M University)|Aggie Muster]] is held annually on the anniversary of the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], April 21, to honor any current and former student who died during the previous year. Over 300 Musters are held around the world, with the largest taking place at [[Reed Arena]] on the [[Texas A&amp;M University campus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lozano&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lozano|first=Juan A.|title=Especially solemn rite of Muster|date=April 22, 2000|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2000_3209862|accessdate=2007-08-16|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent.

Students who die while enrolled at Texas A&amp;M are also honored at Silver Taps, a ceremony held, when necessary, on the first Tuesday of the month.  This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A&amp;M president [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hegstrom&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hegstrom|first=Edward|title='Silver Taps' honors Aggie Bonfire victims|date=December 8, 1999|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1999_3182335|accessdate=2007-08-16|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the day of the ceremony, flags fly half-staff and notices are posted throughout campus. At 10:15 p.m. the lights around campus are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower while students and faculty collect in the Academic Plaza. Following a [[21-gun salute]] by the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad, six [[Bugle (instrument)|buglers]] play an A&amp;M version of the song ''[[Taps]]'', Silver Taps, three times from the dome of the school's Academic Building: once to the north, the south and to the west. The song is not played to the east symbolizing that the sun will never rise on that Aggie again.&lt;ref name=&quot;silvertaps&quot;/&gt;

==== 12th Man ====
Aggie [[college football|football]] fans are called the [[12th Man (football)|12th Man]], meaning they are there to support the 11 players on the field, willing to enter the game, if necessary. To further symbolize their &quot;readiness, desire, and enthusiasm,&quot; the entire student body stands throughout the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;12thMan&quot;&gt;{{Cite document |url = http://aggietraditions.tamu.edu/12thman.shtml |title = Twelfth Man |accessdate = 2006-12-31 |date =  |publisher = Texas A&amp;M University |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition began on January 2, 1922, at the [[Dixie Classic (bowl game)|Dixie Classic]] where A&amp;M played [[Centre College]]. A&amp;M had so many injuries in the first half of the game that [[head coach|Coach]] [[Dana X. Bible]] feared he wouldnât have enough men to finish the game.  He called into the stands for [[E. King Gill#History|E. King Gill]], a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball.  Although he did not actually play, his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. A&amp;M won 22â14, but E.
