==New features==
{{See also|Features new to Windows 7}}
A reviewer guide published by the company describes several areas of improvement in version R2.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008r2guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Microsoft
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include new virtualization capabilities ([[Live Migration]], [[Cluster Shared Volumes]] using [[Failover Clustering]] and [[Hyper-V]]), reduced power consumption, a new set of management tools and new Active Directory capabilities such as a &quot;recycle bin&quot; for deleted AD objects. IIS 7.5 has been added to this release which also includes updated [[FTP]] server services. Security enhancements include the addition of [[DNSSEC]] support for [[Microsoft DNS|DNS Server Service]] ('''note:''' even though DNSSEC as such is supported, only one signature algorithm is available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee649277(WS.10).aspx |title=Understanding DNSSEC in Windows |publisher=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2009-10-07 |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (#5 / RSA/SHA-1). Since many zones use a different algorithm - including the [[DNS root zone|root zone]] - this means that in reality Windows still can't serve as a recursive resolver) and encrypted clientless authenticated VPN services through [[DirectAccess]] for clients using Windows 7. The [[DHCP]] server supports a large number of enhancements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.technet.com/teamdhcp/archive/2009/02/26/new-features-in-dhcp-for-windows-server-2008-r2-windows-7.aspx |title=New features in DHCP for Windows Server 2008 R2 / Windows 7 |publisher=Blogs.technet.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[MAC address]]-based control filtering, converting active leases into reservations or [[Link Layer]] based filters, [[IPv4 address exhaustion]]{{Clarify|date=March 2010}} at scope level{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}, DHCP ''Name protection'' for non-Windows machines to prevent name squatting, better performance through aggressive lease database caching, DHCP activity logging, auto-population of certain network interface fields, a wizard for split-scope configuration, ''DHCP Server role'' migration using WSMT, support for DHCPv6 Option 15 (User Class) and Option 32 (Information Refresh Time). The DHCP server runs in the context of the ''Network Service'' account which has less privileges to reduce potential damage if compromised.

Windows Server 2008 R2 supports up to 64 physical processors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/scalability-ent.aspx |title=Windows Server 2008 R2: Scalability for the Enterprise Customer |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or up to 256 logical processors per system. (Note:Only the Datacenter and Itanium editions can take advantage of the capability of 64 physical processors. Enterprise, the next-highest edition after those two, can only use 8.)&lt;ref name=&quot;2008nov-morethan64processors&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/Sysinternals/MoreThan64proc.mspx|title=Windows7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 support more than 64 Processors in one System|date=November 2008|accessdate=2009-03-06|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; When deployed in a file server role, new File Classification Infrastructure services allow files to be stored on designated servers in the enterprise based on business naming conventions, relevance to business processes and overall corporate policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Server Core includes a subset of the .NET Framework, so that some applications (including [[ASP.NET]] web sites and [[Windows PowerShell]] 2.0) can be used.

Performance improvement was a major area of focus for this release; Microsoft has stated that work was done to decrease boot time, improve the efficiency of I/O operations while using less processing power, and generally improve the speed of storage devices, especially [[iSCSI]].

[[Active Directory]] has several new features when raising the forest and domain functional levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = Appendix of Functional Level Features

|accessdate = 2009-10-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Windows Server 2008 R2. When raising the domain function level, two added features are Authentication Mechanism Assurance and Automatic SPN Management. When raising the forest functional level, the Active Directory recycle bin feature is available and can be enabled using the Active Directory Module for Powershell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Service Packs==
===Service Pack 1===
On February 9, 2011, Microsoft officially released the final release (RTM) of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (SP1) to OEM partners. Apart from bug fixes, it introduces two new major functions, RemoteFX and Dynamic Memory. RemoteFX enables the use of graphics hardware in order to include support for 3D graphics in a Hyper-V based VM while Dynamic Memory makes it possible for a VM to only allocate as much physical RAM as is needed temporally for its execution. On February 16th Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 became available for MSDN and TechNet Subscribers as well as Volume License customers. As of February 22nd, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 is generally available for download via the Microsoft Download Center and available on Windows Update. It has a version number of &quot;6.1.7601.17514.101119-1850&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2011/02/09/announcing-availability-of-windows-7-and-windows-server-2008-r2-sp1.aspx|title=Announcing Availability of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
