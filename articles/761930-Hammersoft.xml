'''Frank C. Erwin, Jr. Special Events Center''', commonly known as '''Frank Erwin Center''' or '''UT Erwin Center''', is a multi-purpose [[arena]] on the [[campus]] of [[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]. It is also sometimes referred to as &quot;The Drum&quot; or &quot;The Superdrum&quot;, owing to its drum-like appearance from outside (not to be confused with [[Big Bertha (drum)|Big Bertha]], the large bass drum used by the University of Texas marching band). The facility is primarily the home court for the UT men's and women's [[basketball]] programs.

==History==
The center, intended to replace [[Gregory Gymnasium]], cost $34 million to build in 1977. The first event to play at the Center was a UT basketball game which occurred on November 29, 1977  [http://www.uterwincenter.com/applause/2007/mar07ap/erc30.html] UT began renovations of the center in 2001 and finished in 2003. Renovations included: Life safety upgrades, new concession stands and restrooms, addition of 28 suites, new scoreboard and indoor electronic video signs, addition of outdoor electronic video signs, and Lone Star Room (reception hall) renovations. The building is named for former UT Board of Regents member Frank Erwin,&lt;ref name=&quot;University of Texas Facilities&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.texassports.com/facilities/tex-facilities.html | title=University of Texas Facilities | publisher=Texas Sports | accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; who attended the The University of Texas and was a member of the same fraternity, [[Kappa Sigma]], as several other prominent alumni who have had buildings at the University named after them (such as [[Beauford Jester]], [[Denton Cooley]], William Hogg and [[Harry Huntt Ransom]]).  Originally known as the Special Events Center, the facility was renamed in 1980 to honor Erwin, who had died that same year. The University has been in recent discussions about selling the naming rights for the Erwin Center.

==Seating==
A two-level layout (the lower ''arena'' and upper ''mezzanine'') accommodates up to 16,755 spectators.  The outer ring of the arena averages around 20 rows deep, while the mezzanine is slightly deeper at around 24 rows.  The size of the arena's inner ring is highly dependent on the event being hosted.

==Current use==
Located right next to downtown [[Austin, TX|Austin]], [[Texas]], The Erwin Center is generally accepted to be Austin's current premier venue for large public and private events. The center holds many diverse events ranging from concerts to wrestling events and private banquets.  The Erwin Center also hosts the semifinals and finals of the [[University Interscholastic League]] boys' and girls' basketball playoffs in all five classifications. The Erwin Center is set to host the United States vs. Spain quarterfinal matches for the [[2011 Davis Cup World Group]].
