In this system, the official name of the [[Quebec City|capital is QuÃ©bec]] in both official languages. The Quebec government renders both names as ''QuÃ©bec'' in both languages.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] in [[Eastern Canada|east]]-[[Central Canada|central]] [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv |Merriam|Webster|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;QLocation&quot;&gt;Quebec is located in the [[Eastern Canada|eastern part of Canada]], but is also historically and politically considered to be part of [[Central Canada]] (with [[Ontario]]).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Canadian province with a predominantly [[francophone|French-speaking]] population and the only one whose sole [[official language]] is [[French language|French]] at the provincial level.
Quebec is Canada's largest province by area and its second-largest [[Canada#Administrative divisions|administrative division]]; only the territory of [[Nunavut]] is larger. It is bordered to the west by the province of [[Ontario]], [[James Bay]] and [[Hudson Bay]], to the north by [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Ungava Bay]], to the east by the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the provinces of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] and [[New Brunswick]]. It is bordered on the south by the [[US state]]s of [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], and [[New York]]. It also shares [[maritime border]]s with [[Nunavut]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Nova Scotia]].

Quebec is Canada's second most populous province, after [[Ontario]]. Most inhabitants live in urban areas near the [[Saint Lawrence River]] between [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]], the capital. [[English-speaking Quebecer|English-speaking communities]] and English-language institutions are concentrated in the west of the [[island of Montreal]] but are also significantly present in the [[Outaouais (region)|Outaouais]], [[Eastern Townships]], and [[GaspÃ© Peninsula|GaspÃ©]] regions. The [[Nord-du-QuÃ©bec]] region, occupying the northern half of the province, is sparsely populated and inhabited primarily by [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CD&amp;Code1=2499&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=24&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Nord-du-Qu%E9bec&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=24&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom= |title=Community highlights for Nord-du-QuÃ©bec |year=2006 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sovereignty plays a large role in the [[politics of Quebec]], and the official [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]] [[social democratic]] [[Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois]] advocates national sovereignty for the province and secession from Canada. [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Sovereignist]] governments have held referendums on independence in [[1980 Quebec Referendum|1980]] and [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]]; both were voted down by voters, the latter defeated by a very narrow margin. In 2006, the [[Canadian House of Commons]] passed a symbolic motion, the [[QuÃ©bÃ©cois nation motion]], recognizing the &quot;[[French-speaking Quebecer|QuÃ©bÃ©cois]] as a [[nation]] within a united Canada.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2528725&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1#SOB-1788846 | work=Hansard of 39th Parliament, 1st Session; No. 087 |title=Routine Proceedings: The QuÃ©bÃ©cois |publisher=Parliament of Canada |date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061127/quebec_motion_061127?s_name=&amp;no_ads= |title=House of Commons passes Quebec nation motion|publisher=CTV News |date=November 27, 2006 |accessdate=October 3, 2009}} &quot;The motion is largely seen as a symbolic recognition of the QuÃ©bÃ©cois nation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

While the province's substantial [[natural resources]] have long been the mainstay of its economy, sectors of the [[knowledge economy]] such as [[aerospace]], information and communication technologies, [[biotechnology]] and the [[pharmaceutical industry]] also play leading roles. These many industries have all contributed to helping Quebec become the second most economically influential province, second only to [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poitras|first=FranÃ§ois |title=Regional Economies Special Report Micro-Economic Policy Analysis |publisher=Industry Canada |url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/eas-aes.nsf/vwapj/srreo200401e.PDF/$FILE/srreo200401e.PDF |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080611170023/http://www.ic.gc.ca/epic/site/eas-aes.nsf/vwapj/srreo200401e.PDF/$FILE/srreo200401e.PDF |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |format=PDF |date=2004-01 |accessdate=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and boundary changes==
[[File:Samuel de Champlain arrive Ã  QuÃ©bec - George Agnew Reid - 1909.jpg|right|thumb|The arrival of [[Samuel de Champlain]], the father of [[New France]], on the site of [[Quebec City]].]]
The name &quot;Quebec&quot;, which comes from the [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]] word '''kÃ©bec''' meaning &quot;where the river narrows&quot;, originally referred to the area around Quebec City where the Saint Lawrence River narrows to a cliff-lined gap. Early variations in the spelling of the name included ''QuÃ©becq'' (Levasseur, 1601) and ''KÃ©bec'' (Lescarbot 1609).&lt;ref&gt;Afable, Patricia O. and Madison S. Beeler (1996). &quot;Place Names&quot;. In &quot;Languages&quot;, ed. Ives Goddard. Vol. 17 of ''Handbook of North American Indians'', ed. William C. Sturtevant. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] chose the name ''QuÃ©bec'' in 1608 for the colonial outpost he would use as the administrative seat for the French colony of [[New France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://history.cbc.ca/history/?MIval=EpContent.html&amp;series_id=1&amp;episode_id=2&amp;chapter_id=4&amp;page_id=4&amp;lang=E | title = Canada: A People's History&amp;nbsp;â The birth of Quebec | publisher = Canadian Broadcast Corporation|year=2001 | accessdate = August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] was founded in the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] formally transferred the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;From [[s:Treaty of Paris (1763)|''Treaty of Paris'']], 1763: &quot;His Most Christian Majesty cedes and guaranties to his said Britannick Majesty, in full right, Canada, with all its dependencies, as well as the island of Cape Breton, and all the other islands and coasts in the gulph and river of St. Lawrence, and in general, every thing that depends on the said countries, lands, islands, and coasts, with the sovereignty, property, possession, and all rights acquired by treaty, or otherwise, which the Most Christian King and the Crown of France have had till now over the said countries, lands, islands, places, coasts, and their inhabitants&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] after the [[Seven Years' War]]. The proclamation restricted the province to an area along the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. The [[Quebec Act]] of 1774 restored the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Ohio River]] Valley regions to the province. The [[Treaty of Versailles, 1783]] ceded territories south of the Great Lakes to the United States.

After the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]], the territory was divided between [[Lower Canada]] (present day Quebec) and [[Upper Canada]] (present day Ontario), with each being granted an elected [[Legislative Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=TOUSIGNANT|first=Pierre|title=Constitutional Act, 1791|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001872|work=The Act and its major effects|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1840, these became [[Canada East]] and [[Canada West]] after the British Parliament unified Upper and Lower Canada into the [[Province of Canada]]. This territory was redivided into the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario at [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867. Each became one of the first four provinces.

In 1870, Canada purchased [[Rupert's Land]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. Over the next few decades the [[Parliament of Canada]] transferred portions of this territory to Quebec that more than tripled the size of the province.&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Canada|Library of the Parliament of Canada]], [http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp412-e.htm#B Parl.gc.ca]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, the Canadian Parliament passed the first [[Quebec Boundary Extension Act, 1898|Quebec Boundary Extension Act]] that expanded the provincial boundaries northward to include the lands of the [[Cree]]. This was followed by the addition of the [[District of Ungava]] through the [[Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912|Quebec Boundaries Extension Act of 1912]] that added the northernmost lands of the aboriginal [[Inuit]] to create the modern Province of Quebec. In 1927, the border between Quebec and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] was established by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. Quebec [[Labrador boundary dispute|officially disputes this boundary]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Quebec}}
[[File:Map of Quebec.png|thumb|Map of Quebec]]

Located in the [[Eastern Canada|eastern part]] of Canada and (from a historical and political perspective) part of [[Central Canada]], Quebec occupies a territory nearly three times the size of [[France]] or [[Texas]], most of which is very sparsely populated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison between the area of Quebec and various countries|url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/jeunesse/territoire/compa_superf_pays.htm|author=Institut de la statistique du QuÃ©bec|publisher=Governement of Quebec|accessdate=July 4, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its area is very different from a region to another due to the varying composition of the ground, the climate (latitude and altitude) and with the proximity with water. The [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]] (south) and the [[Canadian Shield]] (north) are the two main topographic regions and are radically different.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elson&quot; /&gt;

===Present borders===
Quebec shares a land border with four northeast states of the United States ([[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New York]] and [[Vermont]]) and with three other Canadian provinces ([[New Brunswick]], [[Ontario]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;qcborders&quot; /&gt;  However, as said in the ''Etymology and boundary changes'' section, a border dispute remains regarding the ownership of [[Labrador]].  The border with [[Labrador]] is still not officially recognized by Quebec Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vigile.net/1927-le-Quebec-est-ampute-du |title=Labrador is no longer part of Quebec, Explanations on the situation |author=VAILLANCOURT, Jacques|publisher=Vigile.net |date=May 6, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2011|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saic.gouv.qc.ca/centre_de_presse/communiques/2001/saic_com20011031.htm |title= The Minister of Natural Resources of Quebec and Minister for Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs express Quebec's position in relation to the constitutional changes in the designation of Newfoundland|author=Canadian Intergovernmental Affairs Secretariat|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=October 31, 2001|accessdate=December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A maritime boundary also exists with the territories of [[Nunavut]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and [[Nova Scotia]].  Quebec has officially more than {{convert|12000|km|mi}} of borders of all types.  Half of these are land limits, 12% river limits and 38% marine limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;qcborders&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ressources Naturelles et Faune - QuÃ©bec|title=QuÃ©bec's Borders|url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/english/territory/portrait/portrait-borders.jsp|work=highligts on the territory - QuÃ©bec's Borders|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chutes Ã  Michel.jpg|thumb|Michel's falls on [[Ashuapmushuan River]] in [[Saint-FÃ©licien, Quebec|Saint-FÃ©licien]], [[SaguenayâLac-Saint-Jean]].]]

The [[Saint Lawrence River]] has one of the world's largest sustaining inland Atlantic ports at Montreal (the province's largest city), [[Trois-RiviÃ¨res]], and Quebec City (the capital). Its access to the Atlantic Ocean and the interior of North America made it the base of early [[French colonization of the Americas|French exploration and settlement]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Since 1959, the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] has provided a navigable link between the Atlantic Ocean and Great Lakes. Northeast of Quebec City, the river broadens into the world's largest [[estuary]], the feeding site of numerous species of whales, fish and sea birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saguenay-St. Lawrence National Park |url=http://www.greatcanadianparks.com/quebec/saguenp/index.htm|author=|publisher=Digital Wizards (Ontario) Inc.|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river empties into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. This marine environment sustains fisheries and smaller ports in the [[Bas-Saint-Laurent|Lower Saint Lawrence]] (''Bas-Saint-Laurent''), [[CÃ´te-Nord|Lower North Shore]] (''CÃ´te-Nord''), and [[GaspÃ© Peninsula|GaspÃ©]] (''GaspÃ©sie'') regions of the province. The [[Saint Lawrence River]] and its [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence|estuary]] forms the basis of Quebec's development through the centuries. At the same time, many affluent rivers testify to the exploration of land, whose rivers [[Ashuapmushuan River|Ashuapmushuan]], [[ChaudiÃ¨re River|ChaudiÃ¨re]], [[Gatineau River|Gatineau]], [[Manicouagan River|Manicouagan]], [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]], [[Richelieu River|Richelieu]], [[Rupert River|Rupert]], [[Saguenay River|Saguenay]], [[Saint-FranÃ§ois River|Saint-FranÃ§ois]], [[Saint-Maurice River|Saint-Maurice]], etc.

Quebec's highest point at {{formatnum:1652}} meters is [[Mount Caubvik|Mont D'Iberville]], known in English as [[Mount Caubvick]], located on the border with [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in the northeastern part of the province, in the [[Torngat Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=5968 |title=Mont D'Iberville, QuÃ©bec/Newfoundland |author= |publisher=PeakBagger |date=November 1, 2004 |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most populous [[physiographic]] region is the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]]. It extends northeastward from the southwestern portion of the province along the shores of the Saint Lawrence River to the Quebec City region, limited to the North by the [[Laurentian Mountains]] and to the South by the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]].

[[Mixedwood Plains|Mixed forests]] provide most of Canada's [[maple syrup]] crop every spring.

[[File:Canadian shield.gif|thumb|Representation of the distribution of the CS over Quebec's area]]
More than 95% of Quebec's territory lies within the [[Canadian Shield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt; It is generally a quite flat and exposed, mountainous terrain interspersed with higher points such as the [[Laurentian Mountains]] in southern Quebec, the [[Otish Mountains]] in central Quebec and the [[Torngat Mountains]] near [[Ungava Bay]]. The topography of the Shield has been shaped by glaciers from the successive ice ages, which explains the glacial deposits of boulders, gravel and sand, and by sea water and post-glacial lakes that left behind thick deposits of clay in parts of the Shield. The Canadian Shield also has a complex hydrological network of more than a million lakes, bogs, streams and rivers. It is rich in the forestry, mineral and hydro-electric resources that are a mainstay of the Quebec economy. [[Primary industries]] sustain small cities in regions of [[Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue]], [[SaguenayâLac-Saint-Jean]], and [[CÃ´te-Nord]].

The [[Labrador Peninsula]] is covered by the [[Laurentian Plateau]] ([[Canadian Shield]]), dotted with mountains such as [[Otish Mountains]]. The [[Ungava Peninsula]] is notably composed of D'Youville mountains, Puvirnituq mountains and Pingualuit crater. While low and medium altitude peak from western Quebec to the far north, high altitudes mountains emerge in the [[Capitale-Nationale]] region to the extreme east, along its longitude. In the [[Labrador Peninsula]] portion of the Shield, the far northern region of [[Nunavik]] includes the [[Ungava Peninsula]] and consists of flat [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] inhabited mostly by the [[Inuit]]. Further south lie the [[subarctic]] [[taiga]] of the [[Eastern Canadian Shield taiga]] ecoregion and the [[boreal forest]] of the [[Central Canadian Shield forests]], where [[spruce]], [[fir]], and [[poplar]] trees provide raw materials for Quebec's [[Pulp and paper industry in Canada|pulp and paper]] and [[lumber]] industries. Although the area is inhabited principally by the [[Grand Council of the Crees|Cree]], [[Naskapi]], and [[Innu]] [[First Nations]], thousands of temporary workers reside at [[Radisson, Quebec|Radisson]] to service the massive [[James Bay Hydroelectric Project]] on the [[La Grande River|La Grande]] and [[Eastmain River|Eastmain]] rivers. The southern portion of the shield extends to the [[Laurentian mountains|Laurentians]], a mountain range just north of the  [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|Saint Lawrence Lowland]], that attracts local and international tourists to ski hills and lakeside resorts.

The [[ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches|Appalachian]] region of Quebec has a narrow strip of ancient mountains along the southeastern border of Quebec. The [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]] is actually a huge chain that extends from [[Alabama]] to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In between, it covers in Quebec near 800&amp;nbsp;km, from the MontÃ©rÃ©gie hills to the GaspÃ© Peninsula. In western Quebec, the average altitude is about 500 meters, while in the GaspÃ© Peninsula, the Appalachian peaks (especially the Chic-Choc) are among the highest in Quebec, since they exceed 1000 meters.

===Climate===
[[image:Neige Montreal.JPG|thumb|&quot;Mon pays ce n'est pas un pays, c'est l'hiver&quot; (&quot;My country isn't a country, it's winter&quot;) [[Gilles Vigneault]]]]
Quebec has three main climate regions. Southern and western Quebec, including most of the major population centres, have a [[humid continental climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons having warm to occasionally hot and humid summers and often very cold and snowy winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.johnabbott.qc.ca/~geoscience/intro/Bryce/GoodesClimateMap22Ed%20_1_.pdf |title=KÃ¶ppen Climate world map |author=Johnabbott Faculty |publisher=johnabbott.qc.ca |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main climatic influences are from western and northern Canada and move eastward, and from the southern and central United States that move northward. Because of the influence of both storm systems from the core of North America and the Atlantic Ocean, precipitation is abundant throughout the year, with most areas receiving more than 1000&amp;nbsp;mm (40&amp;nbsp;in) of precipitation, including over 300&amp;nbsp;centimetres (120&amp;nbsp;in) of snow in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climat-quebec.qc.ca/home.php?id=norm_entab&amp;mpn=stati_clim&amp;slt_nomStations=34&amp;slt_idStations=7016294&amp;slt_variable=10&amp;slt_periode=2&amp;sub=Afficher |title=Climate Normals, tabular, year |author=Climat-QuÃ©bec |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer, severe weather patterns (such as [[tornado]]es and [[severe thunderstorm]]s) occur occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climat-quebec.qc.ca/home.php?id=p23&amp;mpn=ev_mto_sig |title=Tornadoes |author=Climat-QuÃ©bec |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of central Quebec has a [[subarctic climate]] (KÃ¶ppen ''Dfc''). Winters are long, very cold, and snowy, and among the coldest in eastern Canada, while summers are warm but very short due to the higher latitude and the greater influence of Arctic air masses. Precipitation is also somewhat less than farther south, except at some of the higher elevations. The northern regions of Quebec have an [[arctic climate]] (KÃ¶ppen ''ET''), with very cold winters and short, much cooler summers. The primary influences in this region are the Arctic Ocean currents (such as the [[Labrador Current]]) and continental air masses from the High [[Arctic]].

The four seasons in Quebec are the [[Spring (season)|spring]], the [[summer]], the [[autumn]] and the [[winter]], whose conditions differ by region. They are then differentiated according to the brightness, temperature and precipitation of snow and rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.climat-quebec.qc.ca/home.php?id=norm_entab&amp;mpn=stati_clim&amp;slt_nomStations=34&amp;slt_idStations=7011982&amp;slt_variable=10&amp;slt_periode=1&amp;sub=Afficher |title=Climate Normals, tabular, season |author=Climat-QuÃ©bec |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vegetation===
[[File:GaspÃ© taiga.jpg|thumb|left|Taiga forest in GaspÃ©, QuÃ©bec, Canada]]
Given the geology of the province and its different climates, there is an established number of large areas of vegetation in Quebec. These areas, listed in order from the northernmost to the southernmost are: the [[tundra]], the [[taiga]], the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] (coniferous), [[mixed forest]] and [[deciduous forest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History of Quebec|url=http://redpath-museum.mcgill.ca/Qbp/Natural%20History/nat_hist.html|work=A description of the natural history of the province|publisher=McGill University|accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the edge of the [[Ungava Bay]] and [[Hudson Strait]] is the [[tundra]], whose flora is limited to a low vegetation of [[lichen]] with only less than 50 growing days a year. The tundra vegetation survives an average annual temperature of {{convert|-8|Â°C|Â°F}}. The tundra covers more than 24% of the area of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt; Further south, the climate is conducive to the growth of the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]], bounded on the north by the [[taiga]].
[[File:Ecoregions quebec map.svg|thumb|The different forest areas of Quebec]]
Not as arid as the [[tundra]], the [[taiga]] is associated with the sub-Arctic regions of the [[Canadian Shield]]&lt;ref name=&quot;types veg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Types de vÃ©gÃ©tations du QuÃ©bec|url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/forets/connaissances/connaissances-inventaire-zones.jsp|work=Types of vegetation and climatic zones of Quebec|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=June 22, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is characterized by a greater number of both plant (600) and animal (206) species, many of whom live there all year. The [[taiga]] covers about 20% of the total area of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt; The [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] is the northernmost and most abundant of the three forest areas in Quebec that straddle the [[Canadian Shield]] and the upper [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|lowlands]] of the province. Given a warmer climate, the diversity of organisms is also higher, since there are about 850 plant species and 280 [[vertebrate]]s species. The [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] covers 27% of the area of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt; The [[mixed forest]] is a transition zone between the [[Boreal forest of Canada|Canadian boreal forest]] and [[deciduous forest]]. By virtue of its transient nature, this area contains a diversity of habitats resulting in large numbers of plant (1000) and [[vertebrate]]s (350) species, despite relatively cool temperatures. The ecozone [[mixed forest]] covers 11.5% of the area of Quebec and is characteristic of the [[Laurentides|Laurentians]], the [[ChaudiÃ¨re-Appalaches|Appalachians]] and the eastern [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands|lowlands]] forests.&lt;ref name=&quot;types veg&quot; /&gt; The third most northern forest area is characterized by [[deciduous forest]]s. Because of its climate (average annual temperature of {{convert|7|Â°C|Â°F}}), it is in this area that one find the greatest diversity of species, including more than 1600 [[vascular plants]] and 440 [[vertebrate]]s. Its relatively longe growing season lasting almost 200 days and its fertile soils make it the centre of agricultural activity and therefore of urbanisation of Quebec. Most of Quebec's population lives in this area of vegetation, almost entirely along the banks of the St. Lawrence. Deciduous forests cover approximately 6.6% of the area of Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;naturalhistory&quot; /&gt;

The total forest area of Quebec is estimated at {{convert|750300|sqkm|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;domaine_forestier&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrnf.gouv.qc.ca/forets/quebec/quebec-milieu.jsp|title=Domaine forestier|author=MinistÃ¨re des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=|accessdate=August 19, 2007 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue]] to the [[CÃ´te-Nord|North Shore]], the forest is composed primarily of conifers such as the [[Abies balsamea]], the [[Jack Pine]], the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]], the [[Picea mariana|black Spruce]] and the [[Larix laricina|Tamarack]]. When approaching the river in the south, gradually appear some species of deciduous trees such as the [[Betula alleghaniensis|Yellow Birch]]. The [[deciduous forest]] of the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]] is mostly composed of deciduous species such as the [[Acer saccharum|Sugar Maple]], the [[Acer rubrum|Red Maple]], the [[Fraxinus americana|white Ash]], the [[Fagus grandifolia|American beech]], the [[Juglans cinerea|Butternut (White Walnut)]], the [[Ulmus americana|American elm]], the [[Tilia americana|basswood]], the [[Carya cordiformis|Bitternut Hickory]] and the [[Quercus rubra|northern red oak]] as well as some conifers such as the [[Eastern White Pine]] and the [[Thuja occidentalis|Northern Whitecedar]]. The distribution areas of the [[Betula papyrifera|Paper Birch]], the [[Populus tremuloides|Trembling Aspen]] and the [[Sorbus|Mountain Ash]] cover more than half of Quebec territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arboquebecium.com/index.html |title=L'Arboretum du QuÃ©bec |author=Arboquebecium|publisher=Arboquebecium.com |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples and European exploration===
At the time of first European contact and later colonization, [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]], [[Iroquois]] and [[Inuit]] tribes were the peoples who inhabited what is now Quebec.{{sfn |Webb Hodge|1912| p=39}} Their lifestyles and cultures reflected the land on which they lived. Seven Algonquian groups lived [[nomad]]ic lives based on hunting, gathering, and fishing in the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield: (James Bay Cree, [[Innu]], [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]]) and Appalachian Mountains ([[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Western Abenaki|Abenaki]]).  [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians]], a branch of the Iroquois, lived more settled lives, planting squash and maize in the fertile soils of the St. Lawrence Valley. They appear to have been later supplanted by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] tribe. The Inuit continue to fish and hunt whale and [[Pinniped|seal]] in the harsh Arctic climate along the coasts of Hudson and Ungava Bay. These people traded fur and food and sometimes warred with each other.

[[Basque people|Basque]] whalers and fishermen traded furs with Saguenay natives throughout the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000550 |title=Basques |author=BÃ©langer, RenÃ© |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first French [[List of explorers|explorer]] to reach Quebec was [[Jacques Cartier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quebec|url=http://www.canadafaq.ca/quebec/|work=Facts on the province of Quebec|publisher=canadafaq|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who planted a cross in 1534 at either [[GaspÃ©, Quebec|GaspÃ©]] or [[Old Fort Bay]] on the [[Basse-CÃ´te-Nord|Lower North Shore]]. He sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1535 and established an ill-fated colony near present-day Quebec City at the site of [[Stadacona]], a village of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians.  [[Linguists]] and [[archeologists]] have determined these people were distinct from the Iroquoian nations encountered by later French and Europeans, such as the five nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]''. Their language was [[Laurentian language|Laurentian]], one of the Iroquoian family. By the late 16th century, they had disappeared from the St. Lawrence Valley.

===New France===
{{Main|New France}}
Around 1522 - 1523, the Italian navigator [[Giovanni da Verrazano|Giovanni da Verrazzano]] persuaded King Francis I of France to commission an expedition to find a western route to [[Cathay]] (China).&lt;ref name=Verrazzano &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verrazzano.org/en/index2.php?c=viaggioscoperte |title=1524: The voyage of discoveries|publisher=Verrazzano Centre for Historical Studies|year=2002|accessdate=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 1523, Verrazzano set sail in [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], crossing the Atlantic on a small caravel with 50 men.&lt;ref name=Verrazzano /&gt; After exploring the coast of the present-day Carolinas early the following year, he headed north along the coast, eventually anchoring in the Narrows of New York Bay. The first European to discover the site of present-day New York, he named it Nouvelle-AngoulÃªme in honour of the king, the former count of AngoulÃªme. Verrazzano's voyage convinced the king to seek to establish a colony in the newly discovered land. Verrazzano gave the names ''Francesca'' and ''Nova Gallia'' to that land between New Spain (Mexico) and English Newfoundland.

In 1534, [[Jacques Cartier]] planted a cross in the [[GaspÃ© Peninsula]] and claimed the land in the name of King Francis I.{{sfn |Riendeau|2007| p=36}} It was the first province of New France. However, initial French attempts at settling the region met with failure.{{sfn |Riendeau|2007| p=36}} French fishing fleets, however, continued to sail to the Atlantic coast and into the St. Lawrence River, making alliances with [[Aboriginal people in Canada|First Nations]] that would become important once France began to occupy the land. French merchants soon realized the St. Lawrence region was full of valuable [[fur]]-bearing animals, especially the [[American Beaver|beaver]], an important commodity as the [[European beaver]] had almost been driven to extinction. Eventually, the French crown decided to colonize the territory to secure and expand its influence in America.

[[Samuel de Champlain]] was part of a 1603 expedition from France that travelled into the St. Lawrence River. In 1608, he returned as head of an exploration party and founded Quebec City with the intention of making the area part of the [[French colonial empire]].{{sfn |Grenon|2000}}{{sfn |Liebel|1999}}{{sfn |Binot|2004}} Champlain's ''Habitation de Quebec'', built as a permanent [[fur trade|fur trading]] outpost, was where he would forge a trading, and ultimately a [[military]] alliance, with the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and [[Wyandot people|Huron]] nations. Natives traded their furs for many French goods such as metal objects, guns, alcohol, and clothing.

[[Helen Desportes|HÃ©lÃ¨ne Desportes]], born July 7, 1620, to the [[French people|French]] [[habitants]] (settlers) Pierre Desportes and his wife FranÃ§oise Langlois, was the first child of [[European ethnic groups|European descent]] born in Quebec.

From Quebec, [[coureurs des bois]], [[voyageurs]] and Catholic missionaries used river [[canoe]]s to explore the interior of the North American continent, establishing fur trading forts on the [[Great Lakes]] ([[Ãtienne BrÃ»lÃ©]] 1615), [[Hudson Bay]] ([[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] and [[MÃ©dard des Groseilliers|Groseilliers]] 1659â60), [[Ohio River]] and [[Mississippi River]] ([[Robert Cavelier de La Salle|La Salle]] 1682), as well as the [[Saskatchewan River]] and [[Missouri River]] ([[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de la VÃ©rendrye|de la Verendrye]] 1734â1738).

After 1627, King [[Louis XIII of France]] introduced the [[Seigneurial system of New France|seigneurial system]] and forbade settlement in [[New France]] by anyone other than [[Roman Catholic]]s. [[Sulpician]] and [[Jesuit]] clerics founded missions in [[Trois-RiviÃ¨res]] (Laviolette) and [[Montreal]] or Ville-Marie ([[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]] and [[Jeanne Mance]]) to convert [[New France]]'s Huron and Algonquian allies to [[Catholicism]]. The seigneurial system of governing New France also encouraged immigration from the motherland.

New France became a Royal Province in 1663 under King [[Louis XIV of France]] with a [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]] that included [[intendant of New France|intendant]] [[Jean Talon]]. This ushered in a golden era of [[French colonization of the Americas|settlement and colonization]] in New France, including the arrival of les &quot;[[Filles du Roi]]&quot;. The population grew from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/freepub/98-187-XIE/pop.htm |title=Estimated population of Canada, 1605 to present |author=Statistics Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River and called themselves &quot;[[Canadiens]]&quot; or &quot;[[Habitants]]&quot;. The colony's total population was limited, however, by a winter climate much harsher than that of France, by the spread of diseases, and by the refusal of the French crown to allow [[Huguenots]], or French Protestants, to settle there. The population of New France lagged far behind that of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to the south, leaving it vulnerable to attack. In 1689, the Englishâallied [[Mohawks]] attacked [[Lachine massacre|Lachine]], committing the worst massacre in the history of New France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L6yBv0obAV4C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Battlefields of Canada|last=Beacock Fryer|first=Mary|year=1986|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|isbn=1550020072|page=247|accessdate=2011-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many donnes (the assistants to the Jesuit priests) tried to convert the natives of New France during the 17th century.

===Seven Years' War and capitulation of New France===
[[File:PlainesAbraham.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]]]
Authorities in [[New France]] became more aggressive in their efforts to expel British traders and colonists from the [[Ohio Country|Ohio Valley]]. They began construction of a series of [[fortress|fortifications]] to protect the area.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, pp. 15â19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1754, [[George Washington]] launched a surprise attack on a group of [[Canadien]] soldiers sleeping in the early morning hours.  It came at a time when no declaration of war had been issued by either countries. This frontier aggression known as the [[Jumonville affair]], set the stage for the [[French and Indian War]] (a US designation; in [[Canada]] it is usually just referred to as the Seven Years' War, although [[French Canadian]]s often call it ''La guerre de la ConquÃªte'' [&quot;The War of Conquest&quot;]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eccles, W.

By 1756, France and Britain were battling the [[Seven Years' War]] worldwide. In 1758, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] mounted an attack on New France by sea and took the French fort at [[Louisbourg]].

On September 13, 1759, General [[James Wolfe]] defeated General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] on the [[Plains of Abraham]] outside Quebec City. With the exception of the small islands of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]], located off the coast of Newfoundland, France ceded its North American possessions to Great Britain through the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] in favor of the island of [[Guadeloupe]] for its then-lucrative [[sugar cane]] industry.{{sfn |Hunter|1999| p=505-506}} The [[British Royal Proclamation of 1763]] renamed Canada (part of New France) as the [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]].
[[File:Battle of Sainte-Foy.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]] was the bloodiest battle in Quebec history. It was the last French victory during the [[Seven Years' War]].]] At roughly the same time as the northern parts of New France were being turned over to the British and beginning their evolution towards modern day Quebec and Canada, the southern parts of [[New France]] ([[Louisiana]]) were signed over to Spain by the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]] of 1762. As a result of double cession of Quebec to the British and Louisiana to the Spanish, the [[French colonial empire|first French colonial empire]] collapsed, with France being expelled almost entirely from the continental Americas, left only with a rump set of colonies restricted principally to scattered territories and islands in the Caribbean.{{sfn |Cave|2004}}

After the capture of New France the British implemented a plan to control the [[Canadiens]] and entice them to assimilate into the British way of life. They prevented [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s from holding public office and forbade the recruitment of priests and brothers, effectively shutting down Quebec's schools and colleges. This first British policy of assimilation (1763â1774) was deemed a failure. Both the demands in the petitions of the Canadiens' Ã©lites and the recommendations by Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] played an important role in persuading London to drop the assimilation scheme, but the looming American revolt was certainly also a factor as the British were fearful that the French-speaking population of Quebec would side with the rebellious Thirteen Colonies to the south, especially if France allied with the Americans as it appeared it would.

=== Quebec Act ===
[[File:Province of Quebec 1774.gif|right|thumb|The [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Province of Quebec]] in 1774.]]
With unrest growing in the colonies to the south, which would one day grow into the [[American Revolution]], the British were worried that the French-speaking Canadians might also support the growing rebellion. At that time, French-speaking Canadians formed the vast majority of the population of the province of Quebec (more than 99%) and British immigration was not going well. To secure the allegiance of the approximately 90,000 French-speaking Canadians to the British crown, first Governor [[James Murray (military officer)|James Murray]] and later Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] promoted the need for change. There was also a need to compromise between the conflicting demands of the French-speaking Canadians subjects and those of newly arrived British subjects. These efforts by the colonial governors eventually resulted in enactment of the [[Quebec Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BROWN FOULDS|first=NANCY|title=The Quebec Act|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0006592|work=Effects and Consequences|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 1774.

The Quebec Act provided the Quebec people with their first Charter of Rights. This paved the way to later official recognition of the French language and [[French culture]]. The act also allowed ''Canadiens'' to maintain French [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and sanctioned freedom of religion, allowing the [[Roman Catholic Church]] to remain, one of the first cases in history of state-sanctioned freedom of practice. Further, it restored the Ohio Valley to Quebec, reserving the territory for the fur trade. New France had thus been restored, so that it could play the same role as it did before the Conquest in North America.&lt;ref&gt;W.J.Eccles France in America p.233-34&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of the American Revolution ===

Although the [[Quebec Act]] was unrelated to the events in [[Boston Tea Party|Boston]] of 1773, and not regarded as one of the [[Coercive Acts]]. The timing of its passage led British colonists to the south to believe that it was part of the program to punish them.  The Quebec Act offended a variety of interest groups in the British colonies. Land speculators and settlers objected to the transfer of western lands previously claimed by the colonies to a non-representative government. Many feared the establishment of [[Catholicism]] in Quebec, and that the French Canadians were being courted to help oppress British Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Ammerman, ''In the Common Cause'', 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Invasion of Quebec.tif|thumb|right|Defending Quebec from an American attack, December 1775]]
On June 27, 1775, General George Washington decided to attempt an [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] by the American [[Continental Army]] to wrest Quebec and the St. Lawrence River from the British. A force led by Brigadier General [[Richard Montgomery]] headed north from [[Fort Ticonderoga]] along [[Lake Champlain]] and up the St. Lawrence River valley. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]] persuaded Washington to have him lead a [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec|separate expedition]] through the Maine wilderness. The two forces joined at Quebec City, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]] in December 1775. Prior to this battle Montgomery (killed in the battle) had met with some early successes but the invasion failed when British reinforcements came down the St. Lawrence in May 1776 and the [[Battle of Trois-RiviÃ¨res]] turned into a disaster for the Americans. The army withdrew back to Ticonderoga.{{sfn |Lefkowitz|2008}} Although some help was given to the Americans by the locals, Governor Carleton punished American sympathizers and public support of the American cause came to an end.

The [[American Revolutionary War]] was ultimately successful in winning independence for the Thirteen Colonies. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], the British ceded their territory south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Some online versions of the treaty omit [[Delaware]] from the list of former colonies, but the actual text lists it between [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Maryland]]. For example, see facsimile of a London newspaper announcing the treaty. [http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/milestones/paris/1.jpg] [http://www.earlyamerica.com/earlyamerica/milestones/paris/] Delaware is also included in both the preliminary version of the treaty read in the Continental Congress on 15 April 1783 [http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?hlaw:1:./temp/~ammem_jEZ2::] and the one ratified by the Congress on 14 January 1784 [http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc02617))].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, [[Frederick Haldimand]] took over for [[Guy Carleton]] as governor of Quebec. Haldimand, like the previous governors of the Province of Quebec, appreciated the hard-working [[Canadiens]] and acted in his power to keep the English merchants in line.

The arrival of 10,000 Loyalists to Quebec in 1784 destroyed the political balance that Haldimand (and Carleton before him) had worked so hard to achieve. The swelling numbers of English encouraged them to make greater demands for recognition with the colonial government. To restore stability to his largest remaining North American colony, King George III sent Carleton back to Quebec to remedy the situation.&lt;ref name=&quot;W.J.Eccles France in America p.246&quot;&gt;W.J.Eccles France in America p.246&lt;/ref&gt;

In ten years, Quebec had undergone a dramatic change. What worked for Carleton in 1774 was not likely to succeed in 1784. Specifically, there was no possibility of restoring the previous political balanceâthere were simply too many English people unwilling to reach a compromise with the 145,000 [[Canadiens]] or its colonial governor. The situation called for a more creative approach to problem solving.&lt;ref name=&quot;W.J.Eccles France in America p.246&quot;/&gt;

===Separation of the Province of Quebec===
Loyalists soon petitioned the government to be allowed to use the British legal system they were
used to in the American colonies.  The creation of Upper and Lower Canada allowed most Loyalists to live under British laws and institutions, while the French-speaking population of Lower Canada could maintain their familiar French civil law and the Catholic religion.&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;uelac.org&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact was that the two peoples simply could not co-exist. Therefore, Governor Haldimand (at the suggestion of Carleton) drew Loyalists away from [[Quebec City]] and [[Montreal]] by offering free land on the northern shore of Lake Ontario to anyone willing to swear allegiance to George III. The Loyalists were thus given land grants of {{convert|200|acre|ha|0}} per person. Basically, this approach was designed with the intent of keeping French and English as far apart as possible. Therefore, after the separation of the Province of Quebec, [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] were formed, each with its own government.&lt;ref name=&quot;W.J.Eccles France in America p.246&quot;/&gt;

In 1837 residents of Lower Canada, led by [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] and [[Robert Nelson (insurrectionist)|Robert Nelson]], formed an armed resistance group to seek an end to the unilateral control of the British governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SWiSH v2.0 |url=http://cgi2.cvm.qc.ca/glaporte/1837.pl?cat=ptype&amp;cherche=DOCUMENT |title=Les Patriotes de 1837@1838 |publisher=Cgi2.cvm.qc.ca |date= |accessdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a Declaration of Rights with equality for all citizens without discrimination and a Declaration of Independence of Lower-Canada in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_of_Lower_Canada|title=Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada|author=Nelson, Robert|publisher=Wikisource|date=written in February 1838|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their actions resulted in rebellions in both Lower and [[Upper Canada]]. An unprepared [[British Army]] had to raise [[militia]] force, the rebel forces scored a victory in [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1837)|Saint-Denis]] but were soon defeated. The British army burned the Church of [[Saint-Eustache, Quebec|St-Eustache]], killing the rebels who were hiding within it. The bullet and cannonball marks on the walls of the church are still visible to this day.
[[File:Battle of Saint-Denis.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Saint-Denis (1837)|battle of Saint-Denis]] ]]
After the rebellions, [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] was asked to undertake a study and prepare a [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|report]] on the matter and to offer a solution for the British Parliament to assess.&lt;ref name=&quot;durham&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=37606&amp;PHPSESSID=qj23a0tmehl1lulfrlfrhk0c53|title=LAMBTON, JOHN GEORGE, 1st Earl of Durham|author=Ouellet, Fernand|publisher=Government of Canada |work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report recommended that the two provinces of Upper and Lower Canada be united, and that the French speaking population of Lower Canada be assimilated into British culture. Durham's second recommendation was the implementation of [[responsible government]] across the colonies. Following Durham's [[Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839)|Report]],&lt;ref name=&quot;durham&quot; /&gt; the British government merged the two colonial provinces into one [[Province of Canada]] in 1840 with the [[Act of Union 1840|Act of Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actunion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0000029|title=Act of Union|author=Monet, Jacques|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the political union proved contentious. Reformers in both Canada West (formerly Upper Canada) and Canada East (formerly Lower Canada) worked to repeal limitations on the use of the French language in the Legislature. The two colonies remained distinct in administration, election, and law.

In 1848, Baldwin and LaFontaine, allies and leaders of the Reformist party, were asked by [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] to form an administration together under the new policy of [[responsible government]]. The French language subsequently regained legal status in the Legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;actunion&quot; /&gt;

===Canadian Confederation===
{{main|Canadian Confederation}}
In the 1860s, the delegates from the colonies of [[British North America]] (Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland) met in a series of conferences to discuss self-governing status for a new confederation. The first [[Charlottetown Conference]] took place in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]], followed by the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] in Quebec City which led to a delegation going to London, Britain, to put forth a proposal for a national union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WAITE|first=P.B.|title=Canadian confederation|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001842|work=history of the formation of the Confederation|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of those deliberations, in 1867 the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] passed the [[British North America Act]], providing for the Confederation of most of these provinces. The former [[Province of Canada]] was divided into its two previous parts as the provinces of [[Ontario]] (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada). [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] joined Ontario and Quebec in the new [[Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The other provinces then joined the Confederation, one after the other: [[Manitoba]] and the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1870, [[British Columbia]] in 1871, [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1873, [[Yukon]] in 1898, [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in 1905, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in 1949 and finally [[Nunavut]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Library and Archives Canada|title=Canadian Confederation|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/confederation/023001-3000-e.html|work=List of the Provinces and Territories and their joining dates|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other 62 were charged, of which 32 were crimes of such seriousness that a [[Quebec Superior Court]] judge refused them bail.

The fallout of the crisis marked the zenith and twilight of the FLQ which lost membership and public support.

===Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois and national unity===
{{main|Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois|Quebec sovereignty movement}}
In 1977, the newly elected [[Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois]] government of [[RenÃ© LÃ©vesque]] introduced the [[Charter of the French Language]]. Often known as [[Bill 101]], it defined French as the only official language of Quebec in areas of provincial jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/preamble.html The Charter of the French Language - Preamble]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}, on the Web site of the ''Office quÃ©bÃ©cois de la langue franÃ§aise'', retrieved April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

LÃ©vesque and his party had run in the 1970 and 1973 Quebec elections under a platform of separating Quebec from the rest of Canada. The party failed to win control of Quebec's National Assembly both times&amp;nbsp;â though its share of the vote increased from 23 percent to 30 percent&amp;nbsp;â and LÃ©vesque was defeated both times in the [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] he contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=COMEAU|first=ROMBERT|title=Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0006123|work=History and Achievements|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1976 election, he softened his message by promising a referendum (plebiscite) on [[sovereignty-association]] rather than outright separation, by which Quebec would have independence in most government functions but share some other ones, such as a common currency, with Canada. On November 15, 1976, LÃ©vesque and the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois won control of the provincial government for the first time. The question of [[sovereignty-association]] was placed before the voters in the [[1980 Quebec referendum]]. During the campaign, [[Pierre Trudeau]] promised that a vote for the &quot;no&quot; side was a vote for reforming Canada. Trudeau advocated the [[patriation]] of Canada's Constitution from the United Kingdom. The existing constitutional document, the [[British North America Act]], could only be amended by the [[United Kingdom Parliament]] upon a request by the Canadian parliament.
[[File:Rene Levesque - election 1973 - LAC PA115039.jpg|thumb|[[RenÃ© LÃ©vesque]] in Paul SauvÃ© arena, Montreal, on the 1973 election night]] &lt;!---------DO NOT COPY OR MOVE THIS PICTURE TO ANOTHER SECTION, THIS PICTURE IS A NON-FREE HISTORIC IMAGE-----------&gt;
Sixty percent of the Quebec electorate voted against the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 1980 Quebec Referendum|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/constitution/topics/1092-6040/|work=Facts and results|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation - CBC|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polls showed that the overwhelming majority of English and immigrant Quebeckers voted against, and that French Quebeckers were almost equally divided, with older voters less in favour and younger voters more in favour. After his loss in the referendum, LÃ©vesque went back to Ottawa to start negotiating a new constitution with Trudeau, his minister of Justice [[Jean ChrÃ©tien]] and the nine other provincial premiers. LÃ©vesque insisted Quebec be able to veto any future constitutional amendments. The negotiations quickly reached a stand-still.

Then on the night of November 4, 1981, (widely known in Quebec as ''La nuit des longs couteaux'' and in the rest of Canada as the [[Patriation#The Kitchen Accord|&quot;Kitchen Accord&quot;]]) Federal Justice Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien&lt;!--not PM Trudeau, as erroneously reported here before. PM Trudeau had simply pointed out to the provinces that had held out with LÃ©vesque that he had been individually negotiating with LÃ©vesque, against the terms of the agreement between all the hold-out provinces--&gt; met with all of the provincial premiers except [[RenÃ© LÃ©vesque]] to sign the document that would eventually become the new Canadian constitution. The next morning, they presented the &quot;fait accompli&quot; to LÃ©vesque. LÃ©vesque refused to sign the document and returned to Quebec. In 1982, Trudeau had the new constitution approved by the British Parliament, with Quebec's signature still missing (a situation that persists to this day). The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed Trudeau's assertion that every province's approval is not required to amend the constitution. Quebec is the only province not to have assented to the [[patriation]] of the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001869|title=Constitution, Patriation of|last=Sheppard|first=Robert|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years, two attempts were made to gain Quebec's approval of the constitution. The first was the [[Meech Lake Accord]] of 1987, which was finally abandoned in 1990 when the province of [[Manitoba]] did not pass it within the established deadline. ([[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] premier [[Clyde Wells]] had expressed his opposition to the accord, but, with the failure in Manitoba, the vote for or against Meech never took place in his province.) This led to the formation of the sovereignist [[Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois]] party in Ottawa under the leadership of [[Lucien Bouchard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BUSTA &amp; HUI, Ann|first=Shannon|title=Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois through the years|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/bloc-qubcois-through-the-years/article2008669/|work=Timeline|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had resigned from the federal cabinet. The second attempt, the [[Charlottetown Accord]] of 1992, was rejected by 56.7 percent of all Canadians and 57 percent of Quebeckers. This result caused a split in the [[Parti libÃ©ral du QuÃ©bec|Quebec Liberal Party]] that led to the formation of the new [[Action dÃ©mocratique du QuÃ©bec|Action dÃ©mocratique]] (Democratic Action) party led by [[Mario Dumont]] and [[Jean Allaire]].
[[File:RÃ©fÃ©rendum 1995.PNG|thumb|left|The results of the 1995 Quebec referendum per circonscription. Dark brown means high no %; Dark blue means high yes %]]
On October 30, 1995, with the [[Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois]] back in power since 1994, a [[1995 Quebec referendum|second referendum]] on sovereignty took place. This time, it was rejected by a slim majority (50.6 percent NO to 49.4 percent YES).&lt;ref name=&quot;1995 facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Directeur gÃ©nÃ©ral des Ã©lections du QuÃ©bec|title=RÃ©fÃ©rendum de 1995|url=http://www.quebecpolitique.com/elections-et-referendums/referendums-quebecois/referendum-de-1995/|work=Information and results|publisher=Quebec Politic|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was enshrouded in controversy. Federalists complained that an unusually high number of ballots had been rejected in pro-federalist areas, notably in the largely Jewish and Greek riding of [[Chomedey (electoral district)|Chomedey]] (11.7 percent or 5,500 of its ballots were spoiled, compared to 750 or 1.7 percent in the general election of 1994) although Quebec's chief electoral officer found no evidence of outright fraud. Moreover, this accusation had been brought despite the fact that only 1.82% of total votes were rejected on a total participation rate of 93,5%&lt;ref name=&quot;1995 facts&quot; /&gt; which is lower than the normal rejection rate. The federal government was accused of not respecting provincial laws with regard to spending during referendums (leading to a [[Sponsorship Scandal|corruption scandal]] that would become public a decade later, greatly damaging the Liberal Party's standing), and of having accelerated the naturalization of immigrants in Quebec before the referendum in order that they could vote, as naturalized citizens were believed more likely to vote no. (43,850 immigrants were naturalized in 1995, whereas the average number between 1988 and 1998 was 21,733.){{Citation needed|Important|date=June 2011}}

The same night of the referendum, an angry [[Jacques Parizeau]], then premier and leader of the &quot;Yes&quot; side, declared that the loss was because of &quot;[[Money and the ethnic vote]]&quot;. Parizeau resigned over public outrage and as per his commitment to do so in case of a loss. [[Lucien Bouchard]] became Quebec's new premier in his place.

Federalists accused the sovereignist side of asking a vague, overly complicated question on the ballot. Its English text read as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Do you agree that QuÃ©bec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of QuÃ©bec and of the agreement signed on June&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;1995?''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
After winning the next election in 1998, Bouchard retired from politics in 2001. [[Bernard Landry]] was then appointed leader of the [[Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois]] and [[premier of Quebec]]. In 2003, Landry lost the election to the [[Parti LibÃ©ral du QuÃ©bec|Quebec Liberal Party]] and [[Jean Charest]]. Landry stepped down as PQ leader in 2005, and in a crowded race for the party leadership, [[AndrÃ© Boisclair]] was elected to succeed him. He also resigned after the renewal of the Quebec Liberal Party's government in the [[2007 Quebec election|2007 general election]] and the Parti QuÃ©bÃ©cois becoming the second opposition party, behind the Action DÃ©mocratique. The PQ has promised to hold another referendum should it return to government.

===''Statut particulier'' (&quot;special status&quot;)===
[[image:VuedeMontreal.jpg|thumb|alt=Montreal|[[Downtown Montreal]]]]
Given the province's heritage and the preponderance of French (unique among the Canadian provinces), there is an ongoing debate in Canada regarding the unique status (''statut particulier'') of Quebec and its people, wholly or partially. Prior attempts to amend the Canadian constitution to acknowledge Quebec as a '[[distinct society]]' â referring to the province's uniqueness within Canada regarding law, language, and culture â have been unsuccessful; however, the federal government under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean ChrÃ©tien]] would later endorse recognition of Quebec as a distinct society.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Law Group, ''Canadian Constitutional Law'', Third Edition, Toronto: Edmond Montgomery Publications Limited, p. 1261.&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, [[Quebec nationalism|nationalism]] plays a large role in the politics of Quebec, with all three major provincial political parties seeking greater autonomy and recognition of Quebec's unique status. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to examining and defining the nature of Quebec's association with the rest of Canada.

As of the most recent polls (April 2010), a minority of 39.9 percent of Quebeckers support separation, with a majority of 52.8 percent who opposed separation, and with 7.3 percent undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ELIZABETH THOMPSON |url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/04/06/13489151-qmi.html |title=Canadians answer opinion poll on Quebec separatism |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Quebeckers who support separatism has remained relatively stable since the year 2000, hovering around at roughly 38-43 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Autos/20051022/quebec_referendum_poll_051022/ |title=Quebec divided on question of separation: poll&amp;nbsp;â CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a decline in support after the failed 1995 referendum, where vote levels of support for separation was at 49.4 percent.

==Fundamental values of Quebec society==
On February 8, 2007, Quebec Premier [[Jean Charest]] announced the setting up of a ''[[Bouchard-Taylor Commission|Commission tasked with consulting Quebec Society on the matter of arrangements regarding cultural diversity]]''. The Premier's press release&lt;ref name=&quot;dâÃ©tude&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.qc.ca/actualites/communiques/2007/fevrier/2007-02-08.asp|title=Le premier ministre Ã©nonce sa vision et crÃ©e une commission spÃ©ciale dâÃ©tude|author=Office of the Premier|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=February 8, 2007|accessdate=July 7, 2011|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; reasserted the three fundamental values of Quebec society:

Furthermore, Quebec is a free and democratic society that abides by the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/gouv/societedroit/?lang=en|title=The Rule of Law|author=Quebec Portal|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=August 5, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==

{{Main|Economy of Quebec}}

Quebec has an [[Developed country|advanced]], [[market economy|market-based]] and [[open economy]]. In 2009, its [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of US$ 32,408 [[per capita]] at [[purchasing power parity]] puts the province at par with [[Japan]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], but remains lower than the Canadian average of US$ 37,830 per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|ISQ|2011|p=43|id=ISQ2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation not found}} The economy of Quebec is ranked the 37th largest economy in the world just behind [[Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/salle-presse/communiq/2005/mars/mars0516a.htm|publisher=Gouv.qc.ca |title=Government Statistics |date= |accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked the 21st largest in the [[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/economie/?lang=fr |title=Le QuÃ©bec : une Ã©conomie dynamique |publisher=Government of Quebec |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Montreal Twilight Panorama 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|View of [[Montreal]] from the Mont-Royal belvedere]] Quebec is 16th among selected industrialized countries for the unemployment rate and 17th for the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspq.qc.ca/santescope/default.asp?NumVol=3&amp;nav=N |title=Comparaisons internationales |publisher=Governement of Quebec |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2011|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economy of Quebec represents 20.36% of the [[List of Canadian provinces and territories by gross domestic product|total GDP of Canada]].

Tourism represents 2.5% of Quebec's GDP and nearly 400,000 people are employed in the tourism sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourisme&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.tourisme.gouv.qc.ca/publications/media/document/etudes-statistiques/Tourisme-chiffres2010.pdf|title=Le tourisme en chiffres Ã©dition 2010|publisher=Gouvernement du QuÃ©bec |date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=April 1, 2011|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 30,000 businesses are related to this industry which 70% are located outside of [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait/tourisme/?lang=fr|title=Tourisme au QuÃ©bec|publisher=Gouv.qc.ca |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Quebec welcomed 26 million foreign tourists, most of them from the [[United States]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Mexico]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tourisme&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gouv.qc.ca/publications/referenc/qcem/qcem_eco_tou.htm|title=TOURISTES97 ET DÃPENSES DES TOURISTES, 2008|publisher=Gouv.qc.ca |date= |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of Quebec has 22 tourist regions, each of which presents its geography, its history and culture. The capital, Quebec City, is the only [[fortified city]] in North America and has its own European cachet. The oldest Francophone city in North America, Quebec City was named a World Heritage Site by [[UNESCO]] in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/300|title=Arrondissement historique du Vieux-QuÃ©bec|publisher=UNESCO|date= |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2008. Montreal is the only Francophone metropolis in North America and also the second largest Francophone city after [[Paris]] in terms of population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourquebec.com/ca-en/villesmontreal0.html|title=MontrÃ©al: City of festivals|publisher=bonjourquebec|date= |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This major centre of 3.6 million inhabitants is a tapestry of cultures from the world over with its many neighbourhoods, including Chinatown, the Latin Quarter, the Gay Village, Little Italy, Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, the Quartier International and Old Montreal. Montreal has a rich architectural heritage, along with many cultural activities, sports events and festivals.

The province of Quebec has over 400 museums including the [[MusÃ©e des beaux-arts de MontrÃ©al]], which is the oldest museum in Canada and one of the most important art institutions. It is Montreal's largest museum and is amongst the most prominent in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bonjourquebec.com/ca-en/musees0.html|title=Museums and heritage sites The past is alive and well!|publisher=bonjourquebec|date= |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2009, Premier Jean Charest had announced targets for reducing [[greenhouse gases]] during the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]]. Quebec will cut its emissions by 20% by the year 2020 compared to international reference of 1990. On January 14, 2010, a new law came into force to reduce greenhouse gases from automobiles which represent 40% of Quebec GHGs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/environnement/200912/29/01-934788-ges-le-quebec-sera-aussi-severe-que-la-californie-a-la-mi-janvier.php&lt;/ref&gt; This new law stipulates that car manufacturers serving the territory of Quebec must meet an emission ceiling of 187&amp;nbsp;grams of GHG/km or approximatively 7.7 L/100&amp;nbsp;km.

However, it is still below the [[fertility rate#Related parameters|replacement fertility rate]] of 2.1. This contrasts with its fertility rates before 1960, which were among the highest of any industrialized society. Although Quebec is home to only 23.9 percent of the population of Canada, the number of international adoptions in Quebec is the highest of all provinces of Canada. In 2001, 42 percent of international adoptions in Canada were carried out in Quebec.

The 2006 census counted a total aboriginal population of 108,425 (1.5 percent) including 65,085 [[First Nations|North American Indians]] (0.9 percent), 27,985 [[MÃ©tis people (Canada)|MÃ©tis]] (0.4 percent), and 10,950 [[Inuit]] (0.15 percent). It should be noted however, that there is a significant undercount, as many of the biggest Indian bands regularly refuse to participate in Canadian censuses for political reasons regarding the question of aboriginal sovereignty. In particular, the largest [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Iroquois]] reserves ([[Kahnawake]], [[Akwesasne]] and [[Kanesatake]]) were not counted.

Nearly 9 percent of the population of Quebec belongs to a [[visible minority]] group. This is a lower percentage than that of [[British Columbia]], [[Ontario]], [[Alberta]], and [[Manitoba]] but higher than that of the other five provinces. Most visible minorities in Quebec live in or near [[Montreal]].

Quebec is unique among the provinces in its overwhelmingly [[Roman Catholic]] population. This is a legacy of colonial times when only Roman Catholics were permitted to settle in [[New France]]. The 2001 census showed the population to be 90.3 percent Christian (in contrast to 77 percent for the whole country) with 83.4 percent [[Catholic|Catholic Christian]] (including 83.2 percent [[Roman Catholic]]); 4.7 percent [[Protestant|Protestant Christian]] (including 1.2 percent [[Anglican]], 0.7 percent [[United Church of Canada|United Church]]; and 0.5 percent [[Baptist]]); 1.4 percent [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox Christian]] (including 0.7 percent [[Greek Orthodox]]); and 0.8 percent other [[Christian]]; as well as 1.5 percent [[Muslim]]; 1.3 percent [[Jewish]]; 0.6 percent [[Buddhist]]; 0.3 percent [[Hindu]]; and 0.1 percent [[Sikh]].

A considerable number of Quebec residents consider themselves to be [[bilingual]] (having a knowledge of French and English). In Quebec, about 40.6 percent (3,017,860) of the population are bilingual; on the island of Montreal, this proportion reaches 60.0 percent (1,020,760). Quebec has the highest proportion of bilinguals of any Canadian province. In contrast, in the [[rest of Canada]], only about 10.2 percent (2,430,990) of the population has a knowledge of both of the country's official languages. Overall, 17.4 percent (5,448,850) of Canadians report being bilingual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CD&amp;Code1=2466&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=24&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Montreal&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=Language&amp;Custom= |title=Language |author=Statistics Canada |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, languages other than French on commercial signs have been permitted only if French is given marked prominence. This law has been the subject of periodic controversy since its inception. French place-names in Canada retain their accents in English text. Legitimate exceptions are '''Montreal''' and '''Quebec,'''. However, the accented forms are increasingly evident in some publications. The ''Canadian Style'' states that '''MontrÃ©al''' and '''QuÃ©bec''' (the city) must retain their accents in English federal documents.

Of the population of 7,546,131 counted by the 2006 census, 7,435,905 people completed the section about language. Of these, 7,339,495 gave singular responses to the question regarding their [[first language]]. The languages most commonly reported were the following:

[[File:FÃ©lix Leclerc.jpg|170px| thumb | left | FÃ©lix Leclerc]]
Being a modern cosmopolitan society, today, all types of music can be found in Quebec. From [[folk music]] to [[hip-hop]], music has always played an important role in Quebercers culture. From [[La Bolduc]] in 1920s-1930s to the contemporary artists, the music in Quebec has announced multiple songwriters and performers, pop singers and crooners, music groups and many more. Here are photos of two of Quebec's most popular artists of the last century: the singers [[FÃ©lix Leclerc]] ('50s) and [[CÃ©line Dion]] (present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repertoiredesartistesquebecois.org/index2.asp|title=RÃ©pertoire des artistes quÃ©bÃ©cois|author=Donald Loignon|publisher=DLP multimÃ©dia|accessdate=July 6, 2011|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[First Nations]] and the [[Inuit]] of Quebec also have their own traditional music.
[[File:Celine Dion Concert Singing 'Taking Chances' 2008.jpg|thumb | 200px | Celine Dion during her concert Taking Chances in 2008]]
From Quebec's musical repertoire, the song ''A La Claire Fontaine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000031|title=Ã la claire fontaine|author=Plouffe, HÃ©lÃ¨ne|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|date=|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the anthem of the [[New France]], Patriots and [[French Canadian]], then replaced by the ''[[O Canada]]''. Currently, the song ''[[Gens du pays]]'' is by far preferred by many Quebecers to be the national anthem of Quebec. The [[ADISQ|Association quÃ©bÃ©coise de l'industrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidÃ©o]] (ADISQ) was created in 1978 to promote the music industry in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adisq.com/assoc-profil.html |title=Notre raison dâÃªtre, câest la musique de votre quotidien |author=ADISQ |publisher=Association quÃ©bÃ©coise de lâindustrie du disque, du spectacle et de la vidÃ©o|accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orchestre symphonique de QuÃ©bec]] and the [[Orchestre symphonique de MontrÃ©al]] are respectively associated with the OpÃ©ra de QuÃ©bec and the OpÃ©ra de Montreal whose performances are presented at the [[Grand ThÃ©Ã¢tre de QuÃ©bec]] and at [[Place des Arts]]. The ''Ballets Jazz de Montreal'', the ''Grands Ballets'' and [[La La La Human Steps]] are three important professional troups of [[contemporary dance]].

Various musical events are held throughout Quebec, such as the [[Festival d'Ã©tÃ© de QuÃ©bec]], the ''Emerging Music Festival'' of [[Rouyn-Noranda]], ''Festival en chanson de Petite-VallÃ©e'', the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], the ''Granby International Song Festival'', the ''International Festival of Rhythms of the World'' in Saguenay, the [[Festival Western de Saint-Tite]], the [[Les FrancoFolies de MontrÃ©al|Montreal FrancoFolies festival]], the [[Mondial des Cultures]] of Drummondville, the White Nights of Anse de Roche, [[Woodstock en Beauce]], etc. Other festivals join music to fireworks, such as Grand Feux Loto-QuÃ©bec at the [[Montmorency Falls]], Quebec City, the [[L'International des Feux Loto-QuÃ©bec|International Loto-QuÃ©bec Firework]] at amusement park [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]], Montreal, or the ''Grands Feux du Casino'' in the park of Lac-Leamy in Gatineau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quebecgetaways.com/events-festivals|title=Quebec festivals website|author=Festivals et Ãvenement QuÃ©bec|publisher=SociÃ©tÃ© des Attractions Touristiques du QuÃ©bec and Festivals et ÃvÃ©nements QuÃ©bec|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional music is imbued with many dances, such as the [[jig]], the [[quadrille]], the [[Reel (dance)|reel]] and [[line dancing]], which developed in the festivities since the early days of colonization. Various instruments are more popular in Quebec's culture: [[harmonica]] (music-of-mouth or lip-destruction), [[fiddle]], [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoons]], [[jaw harp]] and [[accordion]]. The ''podorythmie'' is a characteristic of traditional Quebec music and means giving the rhythm with the feet. Quebec traditional music is currently provided by various contemporary groups seen mostly during [[Christmas]] and [[New Year's Eve]] celebrations, [[National Holiday (Quebec)|Quebec National Holiday]] and many local festivals.

The [[CinÃ©mathÃ¨que quÃ©bÃ©coise]] has a mandate to promote the film and television heritage of Quebec. Similarly, the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB), a federal Crown corporation, provides for the same mission in Canada.
In a similar way, the Association of Film and Television in Quebec (APFTQ) promotes independent production in film and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apftq.qc.ca/fr/apftq/mission.asp |title=L'Association des producteurs de films et de tÃ©lÃ©vision du QuÃ©bec |publisher=APFTQ |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Association of producers and directors of Quebec (APDQ) represents the business of filmmaking and television, the Association of Community Radio Broadcasters of Quebec (ARCQ)(French acronym) represents the independent radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radiovision.ca/arcq/ |title=L'Association des radiodiffuseurs communautaires du QuÃ©bec, historique |author=ARCQ |publisher=RadioVision |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several movie theatres across Quebec ensure the dissemination of Quebec cinema. With its cinematic installations, such as the ''CitÃ© du cinÃ©ma'' and ''Mel's'' studios, the city of [[Montreal]] is home to the filming of various productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.micheltrudel.tv/index.html |title=La CitÃ© du CinÃ©ma |author=La CitÃ© du cinÃ©ma |publisher=Mel's CitÃ© du cinÃ©ma |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State corporation [[TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec]], the federal Crown corporation [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], general and specialized private channels, networks, independent and community radio stations broadcast the various [[TÃ©lÃ©roman|Quebec tÃ©lÃ©romans]], the national and regional news, interactive and spoken programmations, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telequebec.tv/corporatif/ |title=Mission TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec |publisher=TÃ©lÃ©-QuÃ©bec |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/about/ |title=About CBC/Radio-Canada |publisher=CBC corporation |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Les Rendez-vous du cinÃ©ma quÃ©bÃ©cois]] is a festival surrounding the ceremony of the [[Jutra Award|Jutra Awards Night]] that rewards work and personalities of Quebec cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesjutra.ca/apropos.php |title=La soirÃ©e des Jutra - Ã propos de nous |author=La soirÃ©e des Jutra |publisher=Radio-Canada |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artis and the [[Gemini Awards]] gala recognize the personalities of television and radio industry in Quebec and French Canada.

===Literature and theatre===
{{Main| Literature of Quebec}}
[[File:Lachassegalerie.jpg| left | thumbnail | 200px | [[Henri Julien]], ''La Chasse-galerie'']]
From New France, Quebec literature was first developed in the travel accounts of explorers such as [[Jacques Cartier]], [[Jean de BrÃ©beuf]], the [[Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce de Lahontan, Baron de Lahontan|Baron de La Hontan]] and [[Nicolas Perrot]], describing their relations with indigenous peoples. The ''Moulin Ã  paroles'' traces the great texts that have shaped the history of Quebec since its foundation in 1534 until the era of modernity. The first to write the history of Quebec, since its discovery, was the historian [[FranÃ§ois-Xavier Garneau]]. This author will be part of the current of patriotic literature (also known as the &quot;poets of the country&quot; and literary identity) that will arise after the [[Lower Canada Rebellion|Patriots Rebellion]] of 1837-1838.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litterature-quebecoise.org/patriote.htm |title=LittÃ©rature patriotique du QuÃ©bec |publisher=Litterature-quebecoise.org |date= |accessdate=June 25, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various tales and stories are told through oral tradition, such as, among many more, the legends of the ''[[Bogeyman]]'', the ''[[Chasse-galerie]]'', the ''Black Horse of Trois-Pistoles'', the ''Complainte de Cadieux'', the ''[[Marie-Josephte Corriveau|Corriveau]]'', the ''dancing devil of Saint-Ambroise'', the ''[[Edouard BeauprÃ©|Giant BeauprÃ©]]'', the ''monsters of the lakes [[Lake Pohenegamook|PohÃ©nÃ©gamook]]'' and ''[[Lake Memphremagog|Memphremagog]]'', of ''[[Quebec Bridge]]'' (called the Devil's Bridge), the ''[[Rocher PercÃ©]]'' and of ''Rose Latulipe'', for example.{{sfn |Dupont|2008}}
[[File:Emile Nelligan 1.jpg| thumbnail | 150px | [[Ãmile Nelligan]], Quebec poet, famous for his poem ''Winter evening'']]
Many [[List of Quebec writers|Quebec poets]] and prominent authors marked their era and today remain anchored in the collective imagination, like, among others, Philippe Aubert de GaspÃ©, [[Octave CrÃ©mazie]], [[HonorÃ© Beaugrand]], [[Ãmile Nelligan]], [[Lionel Groulx]], [[Gabrielle Roy]], [[Hubert Aquin]], [[Michel Tremblay]], Marie Laberge, Fred Pellerin and [[Gaston Miron]]. The [[American Literary Regionalism|regional novel]] from Quebec is called ''Terroir'' novel and is a literary tradition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litterature-quebecoise.org/terroir.htm |title=LittÃ©rature du terroir quÃ©bÃ©cois |publisher=Litterature-quebecoise.org |date= |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; specific to the province. It includes such works as ''The Old Canadians'', ''[[Maria Chapdelaine]]'', ''[[SÃ©raphin: un homme et son pÃ©chÃ©|Un homme et son pÃ©chÃ©]]'', ''Le Survenant'', etc. There are also many successful plays from this literary category, such as ''[[Les Belles-sÅurs]]'' and ''Broue (Brew)''.

Among the theatre troupes are the [[Jean Duceppe|Compagnie Jean-Duceppe]], the ''ThÃ©Ã¢tre La Rubrique'' at the Pierrette-Gaudreault venue of the Institut of arts in Saguenay, the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Le Grenier, etc. In addition to the network of cultural centres in Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quebecvacances.com/centre-culturel |title=Centres culturels au QuÃ©bec |publisher=Quebecvacances.com |date= |accessdate=July 5, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; the venues include the [[Monument-National]] and the ''Rideau Vert'' (green curtain) Theatre in [[Montreal]], the ''Trident'' Theatre in [[Quebec City]], etc. The [[National Theatre School of Canada]] and the [[Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du QuÃ©bec]] form the future players. The summer theatre is a true symbol of Quebec literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grandquebec.com/theatres-du-quebec/theatres-d-ete |title=ThÃ©Ã¢tres d'Ã©tÃ© |publisher=Grand QuÃ©bec |accessdate=January 10, 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guideofficiel.ca/#acc |author=Provencher, Mario |title=Guide officiel du thÃ©Ã¢tre d'Ã©tÃ© |publisher=GuideOfficiel.ca |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented in the summer, it offers a variety of amusements, usually musicals or humorous dramas, sometimes outdoors, in rural and semi-rural regions of Quebec, in venues such as the theatre of ''la Dame de CÅur'' (the Lady of Heart) in [[Upton, Quebec|Upton]], [[MontÃ©rÃ©gie]], the ''Grands ChÃªnes'' (Great Oaks) Theatre in [[Kingsey Falls]], [[Centre-du-QuÃ©bec]] and the theatre of ''la Marjolaine'' in [[Eastmain, Quebec|Eastmain]], [[Estrie]]. The Quebec Theatre Academy and the Quebec Association of Playwrights (AQAD) are the main organizations for the promotion of literature and theatre in Quebec. The Quebec literary awards, including the Medal of the [[AcadÃ©mie des lettres du QuÃ©bec]], and the ''SoirÃ©e des Masques'' reward the important personalities of the year.

===Fine arts===
[[File:Daudelin-CavaliÃ¨re-QuÃ©bec.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Charles Daudelin]], ''La CavaliÃ¨re'', 1963, Sculpture installed in front of the pavilion GÃ©rard Morisset of the Quebec National Museum of Fine Arts in [[Quebec City]]]]
First influenced, since the days of New France, by the religious cult of Catholicism, with works from ''FrÃ¨re Luc'' (Brother Luke) and more recently from [[Ozias Leduc]] and [[Guido Nincheri]], art of Quebec has developed around the specific characteristics of its landscapes and cultural, historical, social and political representations.&lt;ref&gt;''Art History in Quebec'', La collection du MusÃ©e national des beaux-arts du QuÃ©bec, 2004, 268 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the development of Quebec masterpieces in painting, printmaking and sculpture is marked by the contribution of artists such as [[Louis-Philippe HÃ©bert]], [[Cornelius Krieghoff]], [[Alfred LalibertÃ©]], [[Marc-AurÃ¨le Fortin]], [[Marc-AurÃ¨le de Foy Suzor-CotÃ©]], [[Jean-Paul Lemieux]], [[Clarence Gagnon]], Adrien Dufresne, [[Alfred Pellan]], Jean-Philippe Dallaire, [[Charles Daudelin]], [[Arthur Villeneuve]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[Paul-Ãmile Borduas]] and [[Marcelle Ferron]].

While many works decorate the public areas of Quebec, others are displayed in foreign countries such as the sculpture ''EmbÃ¢cle'' (Jam) by Charles Daudelin on ''QuÃ©bec Place'' in [[Paris]] and the statue ''QuÃ©bec Libre!'' (free Quebec!) by [[Armand Vaillancourt]] in [[San Francisco]].
The [[Ãcole des Beaux-Arts de MontrÃ©al|Montreal School of Fine Arts]] forms the [[List of Canadian artists|painters, printmakers and sculptors of Quebec]].

Various buildings reflect the architectural heritage that characterizes Quebec, such as religious buildings, city halls, houses of estates, etc.

===Humor and youth programs===

Several circus troupes were created in recent decades, the most important being without any doubts the [[Cirque du Soleil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cirque du Soleil Inc.|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Cirque-du-Soleil-Inc-Company-History.html|author=Cirque du Soleil |work=Company history|publisher=Funding Universe|accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among these troops are contemporary, travelling and on horseback circuses, such as [[Cirque Ãloize]], [[Cavalia]], ''Kosmogonia'', ''Saka'' and Cirque ''Akya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ellequebec.com/societe/fabuleux-destin-du-cirque-quebecois/a/25816 |title=Le fabuleux destin du cirque quÃ©bÃ©cois |author=Tellier, Chantal |publisher=ELLE QuÃ©bec |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented outdoors under a tent or in venues similar to the [[Casino de MontrÃ©al|Montreal Casino]], they attract large crowds both in Quebec and abroad. In the manner of touring companies of the [[Renaissance]], the [[clown]]s, street performers, [[minstrel]]s, or [[troubadour]]s travel from city to city to play their comedies. Although they may randomly appear from time to time during the year, they are always visible in the cultural events such as the Winterlude in Gatineau, the [[Quebec Winter Carnival]], the [[Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival]], the [[Quebec City Summer Festival]], the [[Just for Laughs|Just for Laughs Festival]] in Montreal and the Festival of New France in Quebec.

The [[Ãcole nationale de cirque|National Circus School]] and the ''Ãcole de cirque de QuÃ©bec'' were created to train future [[Contemporary circus]] artists.

===Gastronomy===
{{Main|Cuisine of Quebec}}
[[File:Gastronomie de MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Gastronomy of Quebec]]
The historical context of 'traditional' Quebec cuisine is from the fur trade period and many dishes have a high fat or lard content. From the early 17th century, French settlers populating [[North America]] were interested in a new cuisine to confront the climate and the needs arising from work of colonization. Mindful of the same nutritional needs as settlers from [[Acadia]], it has many similarities with the Acadian cuisine. Quebec's cuisine has a strong French and Irish influence, although many aspects of Canadian aboriginal cuisine have also had a significant impact on Quebec cuisine. Quebec is most famous for its [[TourtiÃ¨re]], [[PÃ¢tÃ© Chinois]] and [[Poutine]]. The temps des sucres (sugar season) is one of the oldest of Quebec culinary traditions. During springtime, many Quebeckers go to the [[Sugar house|cabane Ã  sucre]] (sugar house) for a traditional meal. The [[Jewish]] community of [[Montreal]] has contributed [[Montreal-style bagel]]s and [[smoked meat]] which is similar to [[pastrami]].

===Sports===
[[File:Boston vs. CH au Centre Bell 007.jpg|thumb|right|Canadiens de MontrÃ©al at the [[Bell Centre]]]]
Sports in Quebec constitutes an essential dimension of Quebec culture. The practice of sports and outdoor activities in Quebec was largely influenced by its geography and climate. The [[ice hockey]] remains the national sport. This sport, which was played for the first time on March 3, 1875 at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal and promoted over the years by numerous achievements of the centenary of the [[Montreal Canadiens|Canadiens de MontrÃ©al]], still raises passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.canoe.ca/sports/nouvelles/hockey/canadiens/archives/2009/12/20091205-065501.html|title=Un anniversaire douloureux}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its history, Quebec has hosted several major sporting events including the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], the Fencing World Championships in 1967, track cycling in 1974, in addition to hosting the [[Canadian Grand Prix|Grand Prix du Canada]] Formula 1 championships.

==National symbols==
{{Main|Symbols of Quebec}}
[[Image:Quebecois flag.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The '''[[FleurdelisÃ©]]''' leads a ship to harbour near Quebec City.]]
In 1939, the [[government of Quebec]] unilaterally ratified its [[Coat of arms of Quebec|coat of arms]] to reflect [[History of Quebec|Quebec's political history]]: French rule (gold lily on blue background), British rule (lion on red background) and Canadian rule (maple leaves) and with Quebec's motto below &quot;Je me souviens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drapeau.gouv.qc.ca/ Justice QuÃ©bec&amp;nbsp;â Drapeauet et symboles nationaux] {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Je me souviens]] (&quot;I remember&quot;) was first carved under the coat of arms of Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] faÃ§ade in 1883. It is an official part of the coat of arms and has been the official license plate motto since 1978, replacing &quot;''La belle province''&quot; (the beautiful province). The expression ''La belle province'' is still used mostly in tourism as a nickname for the province.

The fleur-de-lis, the ancient symbol of the [[French monarchy]], first arrived on the shores of the [[GaspÃ©sie]] in 1534 with [[Jacques Cartier]] on his first voyage. In 1900, Quebec finally sought to have its own uniquely designed flag. By 1903, the parent of today's flag had taken shape, known as the &quot;''[[FleurdelisÃ©]]''&quot;. The flag in its present form with its 4 white &quot;[[fleur-de-lis]]&quot; lilies on a blue background with a white cross replaced the [[Union Jack]] on Quebec's [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]] on January 21, 1948.

===Other official symbols===
[[File:Harfang sur neige.jpg|thumb|left|The ''harfang des neiges'' ([[snowy owl]]), official bird of Quebec.]]
*The floral emblem of Quebec is the ''[[Iris versicolor]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qsymbols&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gouv.qc.ca/portail/quebec/pgs/commun/portrait?id=portrait.drapeau&amp;lang=en|author=Quebec Portal|publisher=Government of Quebec|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=July 12, 2011|title=National Flag and Emblems}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Since 1987 the avian emblem of Quebec has been the [[Snowy Owl|snowy owl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Qsymbols&quot;/&gt;
*An official tree, the [[yellow birch]] (''bouleau jaune'', ''merisier''), symbolises the importance Quebeckers give to the forests. The tree is known for the variety of its uses and commercial value, as well as its autumn colours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qsymbols&quot;/&gt;

In 1998 the [[Montreal Insectarium]] sponsored a poll to choose an official insect. The [[Limenitis arthemis|White Admiral]] butterfly (''Limenitis arthemis'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/insectarium/toile/info_insectes/fiches/fic_fiche08_amiral.htm |title=Amiral [Toile des insectes du QuÃ©bec&amp;nbsp;â Insectarium &amp;#93; |publisher=.ville.montreal.qc.ca |date=May 29, 2001 |accessdate=July 11, 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; won with 32&amp;nbsp;% of the 230&amp;nbsp;660 votes against the Spotted [[Coccinellidae|lady beetle]] (''Coleomegilla maculata lengi''), the [[Ebony Jewelwing]] [[damselfly]] (''Calopteryx maculata''), a species of [[bumble bee]] (''Bombus impatiens'') and the six-spotted [[tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela sexguttata sexguttata'').

===FÃªte nationale (National Holiday)===
{{Main|FÃªte nationale du QuÃ©bec}}
In 1977, the [[Quebec Parliament]] declared June 24 to be Quebec's National Holiday. Historically June 24 was a holiday honouring French Canada's patron saint, [[St. John the Baptist]], which is why it is commonly known as ''La Saint-Jean-Baptiste'' (often shortened to ''La St-Jean''). On this day, the song &quot;[[Gens du pays]]&quot; by [[Gilles Vigneault]] is often heard and commonly regarded as Quebec's unofficial anthem. The festivities occur on June 23 and June 24 and are celebrated all over Quebec. In cities like [[Quebec City|QuÃ©bec]] and [[MontrÃ©al]], great shows are organized in the main public places (such as the Abraham plains, [[Quebec City|QuÃ©bec]], or Maisonneuve Park, [[MontrÃ©al]]) where several of the most popular Quebec artists relay each others till late at night.
