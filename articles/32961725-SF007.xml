'''Synaptic''' is a [[computer program]] which is a [[GTK+]] [[graphical user interface]] front-end to the [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] for the [[Debian]] package management system. Synaptic is usually used on systems based on [[Deb (file format)|deb]] packages but can also be used on systems based on [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]] packages. It can be used to install, remove and upgrade software packages and to add [[Software repository|repositories]].

==Features==
* Install, remove, upgrade and downgrade single and multiple packages
* System-wide upgrade
* Package search utility
* Manage package repositories
* Find packages by name, description and several other attributes
* Select packages by status, section, name or a custom filter
* Sort packages by name, status, size or version
* Browse available online documentation related to a package
* Download the latest changelog of a package
* Lock packages to the current version
* Force the installation of a specific package version
* Undo/Redo of selections
* Built-in terminal emulator for the package manager

It also has the following features for [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] only:
* Configure packages through the debconf system
* [[Xapian]]-based fast search
* Get screenshots from screenshots.debian.net

==Usage==
The package manager enables the user to install, to upgrade or to remove software packages.  To install a package a user must search for the program they want and mark it for installation.  Changes are not applied instantly; the user must first mark all changes and then apply them.

==History==
Synaptic development was funded by [[Conectiva]], which asked [[Alfredo Kojima]], then an employee, to write a graphical frontend for APT, continuing the work initiated with the creation of the APT RPM backend, [[apt-rpm]]. Eventually Synaptic became used in Conectiva's install process. Gustavo Niemeyer also worked on it, while working for Conectiva. It is now maintained by Michael Vogt.

==Alternatives==
{{Main|Ubuntu Software Center}}
In October 2009, when the Ubuntu Software Center became available, Synaptic and other utilities were to be replaced by the Ubuntu Software Center in an unspecified future version of Ubuntu.&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuWiki&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter|title = SoftwareCenter|accessdate = 2011-03-03|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = September}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot, Synaptic has been removed from the default installation, but remains available as a package in the repository. &lt;ref name=&quot;Webupd8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.webupd8.org/2011/06/synaptic-removed-from-ubuntu-1110-deja.html|title = Synaptic removed from Ubuntu 11.10|accessdate = 2011-06-23|last = |authorlink = |year = 2011|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When one installs a new package, [[Aptitude (software)|Aptitude]], like Synaptic, automatically installs required packages (called ''dependencies''). But when one removes a manually installed package, Aptitude also has the ability to remove the no-longer-used  packages that were automatically installed.
