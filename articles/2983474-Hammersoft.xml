'''Paul Stanton Wylie''' (born October 28, 1964) is an [[United States|American]] [[figure skating|figure skater]] and [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympic]] silver medalist.

==Biography==
Born in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]], Wylie began skating at the age of three.  At age eleven, his family moved to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], [[Colorado]], where he began to train with [[Carlo Fassi]].  Wylie remained with Fassi for nine years, first in Denver and later in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] when Fassi relocated to the [[Broadmoor Skating Club]].  As a young skater, Wylie additionally worked with [[John Curry]] and [[Robin Cousins]], who were also students of Fassi.  Cousins lived with the Wylie family while he was training for the [[1980 Winter Olympics]].

In 1979, Wylie won the novice men's title at the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]], and in the 1981 season, he won both the U.S. junior title and the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championship]].  At the latter event, he landed his first triple jumps in competitionâtwo triple toe loops.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;1981 Junior World's Report&quot;, ''Skating'' magazine, March 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Wylie was competing in [[pair skating]] with partner Dana Graham.  They won the junior pairs title at the 1980 U.S. nationals. They were coached by [[John Nicks]], commuting to work with him in California.  They placed eighth in the senior division at the 1981 U.S. nationals, but then dissolved their partnership when they lost financial sponsorship.

In 1985, wanting to reconstruct some of his technique, Wylie left Fassi and began to train instead with [[Evy Scotvold|Evy]] and [[Mary Scotvold]], who were at that time located in [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]], [[Wisconsin]].  Shortly afterwards, they all moved to the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area.  Wylie attended [[Harvard University]] beginning in 1986. He was a member of the Fox Club, one of eight elite final clubs at the college.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  He graduated in 1991.

Wylie placed second at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] in 1988, 1990, and 1992.  He won the silver medal at the [[1992 Winter Olympics]] in [[Albertville, France|Albertville]], [[France]].  The medal was considered a major upset.  Wylie had never finished higher than ninth at the [[World Figure Skating Championships]] four years prior, and had skated such a poor performance at the U.S. Championships immediately prior to the games that reporters questioned his placement on the Olympic team.  The [[USFSA]] had even left Wylie off the team for the 1992 World Championships, naming [[Mark Mitchell (American figure skater)|Mark Mitchell]] in his place.

After the Olympics, Wylie joined the professional skating ranks. He won the 1992 U.S. Open Professional Championship and the 1993 [[World Professional Figure Skating Championships]]. Wylie toured with [[Stars on Ice]] from 1992 to 1998 before retiring to attend [[Harvard Business School]] and work in the corporate world. For some time he held a position with [[The Walt Disney Company]].

In 2004, after leaving Disney, Wylie returned to the ice for twenty two dates with [[Stars on Ice]]. He has also continued his long association with [[An Evening with Champions]], the annual benefit show at Harvard.  Wylie has worked as a sports commentator/analyst, most recently for [[ESPN]] and [[Universal Sports]].  

On August 14, 1999, Wylie married Cape Cod native Kate Presbrey.  They have three children, Hannah, Emma and Caleb, and currently reside in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], where Wylie previously worked with the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] as director of the ''Dare to be a Daniel'' program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Wylie is currently in business for himself running a sports-related travel agency and is coaching figure skaters at the Extreme Ice Center in Indian Trail, North Carolina.

On January 10, 2008, the World Figure Skating Museum and Hall of Fame announced that Wylie would be inducted into the [[U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame]] on January 25, 2008.
