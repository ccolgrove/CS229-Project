The '''1978â79 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team''' is considered the greatest in the school's history. The Sycamores were undefeated in the regular season and were led by [[Larry Bird]]. He led an undefeated team to the national title game versus a [[Magic Johnson]]-led [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] team, and ended the season as National Runner-Up with a record of 33â1.

==Offseason==
Head coach [[Bob King (basketball)|Bob King]] suffered a stroke and was unable to continue as head coach of the Sycamores. Assistant [[Bill Hodges]] was elevated to the position of head coach.
===Exhibition vs. Soviet National Team===
On November 20, the touring [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet National team]] came to Hulman Center to play Indiana State. ISU defeated the Soviets, 83â79, to become one of only four college teams to beat them that season.&lt;ref name=&quot;wthitv.com&quot;&gt;http://www.wthitv.com/dpp/wildcard_1/wildcard_01/in_isu_1978_79_Dream_Season_Recap_20090306&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regular season==
During the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978â79 season]], Indiana State qualified for the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. ISU finished the regular season to finish 29â0, 16â0 in the Missouri Valley Conference, and earned the top ranking in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;wthitv.com&quot;/&gt; 

The only time that the perfect regular season was in jeopardy was on Feb. 1. The Sycamores were 18â0 against [[New Mexico State Aggies men's basketball|New Mexico State]]. With three seconds remaining, the Sycamores were down 83â81. New Mexico State was at the free throw line and the shot was missed. The missed shot was rebounded by Brad Miley and passed to Bob Heaton. Heaton launched a 50-foot desperation shot which banked through the net to send the game into overtime.&lt;ref name=&quot;wthitv.com&quot;/&gt;

Bird received several honors at the end of regular season. He won the [[USBWA College Player of the Year]], [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.naismithawards.com/History/tabid/55/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden Award]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://woodenaward.cstv.com/ot/award-winners.html&lt;/ref&gt; given to the year's top male college basketball player.
