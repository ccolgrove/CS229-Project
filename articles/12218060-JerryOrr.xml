Following [[Charles Kennedy]]'s announcement that he would resign as leader of the Liberal Democrats, Hemming announced on his weblog that he was taking soundings as to whether to stand. When Kennedy subsequently resigned, Hemming said that he would stand to ensure there was a contest. Hemming was a rank outsider in the contest (some betting odds were in excess of 400â1). ''The Times'' reported that he was &quot;an eccentric who left colleagues aghast by threatening to stand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Greg |last=Hurst |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,17129-1983000,00.html |title=Party contenders set out their stalls |work= [[Times Online]] |date= 13 January 2006| accessdate = 10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 January 2006, Hemming withdrew his candidature, saying that Lib Dem members did not believe he should stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Hemming |url = http://johnhemming.blogspot.com/2006/01/members-back-hemming.html |title = Members back Hemming |date= 13 January 2006 | accessdate = 10 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a nominator for [[Mark Oaten]], but said he would be willing to do the same for any serious candidate.
