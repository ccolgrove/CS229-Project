{{2009 WAC football standings}}
The '''2009 Boise State Broncos football team''' represented [[Boise State University]] in the [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009 college football season]]. The Broncos played their home games at [[Bronco Stadium]], most famous for its blue [[artificial turf]] surface, often referred to as the &quot;smurf-turf&quot;. They completed the regular season undefeated (13â0), their second consecutive unbeaten regular season and fourth in the last six years (2004, 2006, 2008, 2009), and won the WAC title for the seventh time in the last eight years. The Broncos capped their season with a showdown against fellow unbeaten [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] in the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl]], which marked the Broncos' return to the site of the game that put the program on the national sports map, the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl]]. With their 17â10 win, the Broncos avenged a loss to the [[2008 TCU Horned Frogs football team|Horned Frogs]] in [[2008 Boise State Broncos football team|the previous season's]] [[2008 Poinsettia Bowl|Poinsettia Bowl]], and became only the second team in [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] history to finish a season 14â0, after [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State in 2002]] ([[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] became the third team to go 14â0 just three days after the Fiesta Bowl). The Broncos finished ranked #4 in the Associated Press and USA Today coaches poll for their highest ranking in school history to finish a season.

Head Coach [[Chris Petersen]] was named the [[Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant Award|Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant]] National Coach of the Year, an award he also won following the [[2006 Boise State Broncos football team|2006]] season. Petersen is the first two time winner of the award since it was renamed in 1986.

==Previous season==
The Broncos were one of only two teams (the other being the [[2008 Utah Utes football team|Utah Utes]]) to finish the 2008 regular season with an undefeated record and win their sixth WAC Championship in seven years. However, The Broncos were unable to finish the season undefeated after losing 17â16 to [[2008 TCU Horned Frogs football team|#11 TCU]] in the [[2008 Poinsettia Bowl|San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl]].

== Pre-season ==
The Broncos entered the 2009 season as one of the youngest college teams in the nation, with only five seniors on their roster, easily the fewest in FBS. No other team had fewer than nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/acc/post/_/id/2457/acc-still-very-young-future-is-bright |title=ACC still very young: Future is bright |first=Heather |last=Dinich |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-season Top 25 polls ===
On August 6 Boise State received 542 points to rank 16th in the USA Today preseason poll, two spots behind their season opening opponent, Oregon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/usatpoll.htm | work=USA Today | title=Oregon leaps TCU, lands at No. 4 as Texas falls; Nevada joins}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. The Broncos were the highest rated non BCS conference school. 

On August 22 Boise State received 659 points to rank 14th in the Associated Press preseason poll, two spots ahead of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankings?pollId=1&lt;/ref&gt; Just as they were in the USA Today poll, the Broncos were the highest rated non BCS conference school. The 14th ranking was the highest preseason ranking in school history.

=== WAC Media Day &lt;ref&gt;http://www.wacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10100&amp;ATCLID=204765175&lt;/ref&gt;===

On July 29, Boise State was picked to win the WAC and received 8 first place votes in the WAC coaches poll to 1 first place vote for Nevada, but it should be noted that no coach can vote his own team in first place, thus Boise State received all 8 possible first place votes. 

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boise State (8) 64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nevada (1) 55
&lt;li&gt;Fresno State 45
&lt;li value=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Louisiana Tech 45
&lt;li value=&quot;5&quot;&gt;Hawaiâi 36
&lt;li&gt;San Jose State 34
&lt;li&gt;Utah State 21
&lt;li&gt;New Mexico State 13
&lt;li&gt;Idaho 11
&lt;/ol&gt;

The media also voted Boise State to win the conference with the Broncos receiving 55 first place votes to only 3 for Nevada. 

# Boise State (55) 519
# Nevada (3) 444
# Fresno State 365
# Louisiana Tech 360
# Hawaiâi 275
# San Jose State 263
# Utah State 170
# Idaho 110
# New Mexico State 104

And Kyle Wilson was named the preseason Defensive Player of the Year.

=== South endzone bleacher expansion ===
For the second consecutive year Bronco Stadium received an expansion, this time in the south endzone temporary bleachers. Following the multi-million dollar sky box expansion which opened in 2008, the sub-million dollar bleacher expansion extends the number of rows in the south endzone and adds an additional 1,600 seats to the stadium capacity, which is now 33,510.

''2nd meeting. 1â0 all time. Last meeting in 2008, a 37â32 Broncos win in Eugene.'' 

On August 31, this game was named the Allstate Sugar Bowl Manning Award Matchup of the Week for the matchup of Boise State QB Kellen Moore vs Oregon QB [[Jeremiah Masoli]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allstatesugarbowl.org/site.php?pageID=19&amp;newsID=65&lt;/ref&gt;

The Broncos won their 50th straight regular season home game, and the first ever at home against a top 25 team, with a 19â8 win over the Oregon Ducks, the second straight year the Broncos have beaten the highly ranked Pac-10 team. The Bronco defense completely shut down the fast paced spread option offense of Oregon holding them to six first half three and outs, forced a safety in the second quarter, did not allow a first down until 7:07 left in the third quarter and only allowed six overall, and only allowed 31 rushing yards. The Bronco offense scored on a 10 yard TD pass from Kellen Moore to Austin Pettis in the second quarter (Michael Choate 2pt conv.), a D.J. Harper 1 yard TD run in the third (conv. failed), and a 45 yard Kyle Brotzman field goal, but missed several other opportunities to score with two missed field goals, another failed on a bad snap, and three straight fumbles in the second half. The Broncos set a school record with 59 rushing attempts. Kellen Moore finished 19/29 for 197 and 1 TD. Austin Pettis had 6 catches for 68 yards and the TD. The Broncos out gained the Ducks 351 to 152. The 34,127 in attendance set a new Bronco Stadium record. The Broncos moved up 2 spots in the AP poll to #12 and 5 spots in the Coaches poll to #11.

''First ever meeting. The RedHawks are scheduled to return to Boise in 2012. There are currently no future plans for Boise to play at Miami.''

Boise State shutout a non-conference FBS school for the first time in school history by dominating Miami (OH) 48â0. The Broncos outgained the RedHawks 441 to 197. Kellen Moore went over 300 yards for the fifth time in his career and threw 4 touchdowns for the first time in his career. Austin Pettis and Titus Young both had over 110 yards receiving with longs of over 50 each and 3 combined touchdowns. The Broncos held their opponent to less than 40 yards rushing for the second consecutive week (Oregon: 31, Miami: 38) and forced 4 interceptions (Iloka, Johnson, Smith, Tevis). When asked about stopping the run, safety Jeron Johnson said, &quot;That's the key to our defense is to stop the run game and make them pass.

''12th meeting. 7â4 all time. Last meeting in 2008, a 61â10 Broncos win in Boise.''

An offensive explosion occurred in Fresno with the Broncos and Bulldogs combining for 987 yards, 1494 yards including return yards in a 51â34 Bronco win. [[Winston Venable]] opened the scoring with a 30 yard interception return for a touchdown on the Bulldogs opening drive. The Broncos would follow with a 32-yard Kyle Brotzman field goal to go up 10â0. A 60 yard touchdown run by D.J. Harper on the Broncos next possession was just a sampling of the fireworks that would follow. After a Fresno State field goal, Titus Young returned the following kickoff 77 yards to set up a 7 yard touchdown catch to him from Kelln Moore. The Broncos looked to be in complete control of the game at 24â3, but Ryan Mathews of Fresno State would answer with consecutive 69 and 60 yard touchdown runs to bring the Bulldogs within 7 at the half. The Broncos returned the opening kickoff of the 2nd half for a touchdown only to see it overturned on offsetting penalties for a block in the back and a personal foul, but Doug Martin would return the next kick 77 yards to set up a Brotzman field goal. The Bulldogs would drive and score a touchdown to bring the score to 27â24. The Broncos would follow with a 74 yard Jeremy Avery rush which was fumbled at the 1 yard line but recovered in the end zone for a Bronco touchdown by Titus Young. Fresno answered with a 17-play drive ending with a 27-yard field goal to end the 3rd quarter with a score of 34â27. In the first two minutes of the 4th quarter, Kellen Moore connected with Austin Pettis for a 8 yard touchdown catch, Ryan Mathews broke his third 60+ yard touchdown run of the night, this time 68 yards, then Jeremy Avery scored on a 67-yard screen pass to bring the score to 48â34. Following a 69-yard Jeremy Avery rush the Broncos added a late 24-yard field goal by Jimmy Pavel to end the scoring. The Broncos and Bulldogs combined for 8 plays of 60 yards or more with 2 being over 70. Despite the 17-point win, the Broncos gave up 507 yards. Boise State moved to #8 in both major polls, their highest regular-season ranking in school history to date.

''3rd meeting. 2â0 all time. Last meeting in 2008, a 20â7 Broncos win in Boise.'' 

The Broncos made a rare trip to the Eastern time zone and walked away with a victory against a MAC team for the second time this season with a 49â14 win over Bowling Green. After a scoreless first quarter, the Broncos ran off 22 points in a span of 2:47 in the second quarter with two Titus Young TD runs (18, 25) and a Doug Martin TD run (34). The Broncos first six scoring drives all took only four plays or less. Kellen Moore threw for 195 yards in the second quarter and finished 17/21 for 247 and 2 TDs before leaving the game midway through the third quarter. Jeremy Avery got his first rushing TD of the season in impressive fashion with a 71 yard run in the third. The Broncos gained a total of 529 yards. The Broncos once again set a school record by climbing to #5 in all major polls, including the Harris poll which debuted this week.

''4th meeting. 3â0 all time. Last meeting 1985, a 13â9 Broncos win in Boise. Boise State head coach Chris Petersen was quarterback for UC Davis in the last meeting.''

[[File:Boise State pregame 2009 vs UC Davis.JPG|300px|left|thumb||Boise State players during pregame]]

It was a game that was much closer than was expected as UC Davis of the FCS gave the Broncos all they could handle in a 34â16 Bronco win in a cold, rain-soaked, tension-filled Bronco Stadium. The Aggies held the Broncos scoreless in the first quarter and held them on a 4th and goal at the 1 yard line to give them momentum for the rest of the game. The Broncos did manage to be up 13â0 at half time on two Kyle Brotzman FGs and a Kellen Moore to Austin Pettis TD pass, but UC Davis hung close in the second half with scores of 20â10 and 27â16 before a late Doug Martin TD sealed the win for the Broncos. Austin Pettis had a career high of 10 receptions for 129 yards and two TDs. Ryan Winterswyk recorded a sack for the third straight game and blocked a field goal right before halftime. The Bronco defense was without their captain Kyle Wilson who missed the game with a shoulder injury. The lackluster performance by the Broncos contributed to them dropping in the AP and Coaches polls to #6, but they did remain #5 in the Harris poll.

''5th meeting. 4â0 all time. Last meeting in 2004, a 45â42 Broncos win in Tulsa. Tulsa is scheduled to play at Boise in 2011.'' 

Big plays kept Tulsa in the game, but the Broncos were able to hang on to remain undefeated with a 28â21 win. The Broncos gave up points in the 1st quarter for the first time this season and had their first deficit of the season. Tulsa connected on long TD passes of 55 and 53 yards. The Broncos tried to answer with their own big plays, but could not connect twice on long passes to Titus Young. Instead the Broncos moved the ball with a steady dose of Doug Martin (112 YDS) and Jeremy Avery (73 YDS) on the ground to set up 3 short Kellen Moore TD passes (8,17,2), 2 to Tommy Gallarda. Tulsa held the Broncos in the redzone twice leading to 2 Kyle Brotzman field goals (27,18). Tulsa had the ball with a chance to score to tie the game but were unable to convert on a 4th down with 37 seconds to play. The Bronco defense came up with 13 tackles for loss and 5 sacks, 2 by Ryan Winterswyk, bringing his season total to 5. The Broncos would fall in the AP poll to #6 but rose to #5 in the Coaches poll and debuted at #4 in the BCS poll, their highest ranking in any major poll in school history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broncosports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=9900&amp;ATCLID=204816489&lt;/ref&gt;

Boise State had lost their last two trips to the islands in 2007, but this game was never in doubt as the Broncos beat the Warriors for the 8th time in 9 years as a member of the WAC. Kellen Moore had a career high 5 TD passes (35, 14, 24, 10, 48) going 18/30 for 223 yards. Titus Young caught 8 passes for 115 yards and 3 TDS. Freshman running back Matt Kaiserman, who had been hurt the entire season, made his Bronco debut and ran for 122 yards, 51 of those on the Broncos final drive alone where he carried the ball on all 11 plays to lead to his first career TD. The score could have been much worse than it was, but Hawai'i was able to force the Broncos to attempt 5 field goals, 4 of which Kyle Brotzman made (25, 28, 32, 27). The Bronco defence force 3 INTS, 2 by Jeron Johnson, and 3 fumble recoveries. The Broncos did continue to have center to quarterback exchange problems which led to 6 fumbles, all of which they did recover, and center Thomas Byrd was replaced by Garret Pendergast, but Pendergast snapped a ball into the end zone which led to a Hawai'i safety. The Broncos remained the same in the AP (#6) and the two human BCS polls (Coaches #5, Harris #5), but their BCS computer poll average fell from #5 to #8 to bring their BCS ranking to #7.

[[File:Kirby Moore October 31 2009.JPG|00px|left|thumb||Kirby Moore had a 61 YD TD for his first career TD]]
The Broncos cruised to their 20th straight regular season win to remain undefeated on the season with a 45â7 win over San Jose State. The Broncos opened the game with a 61 yard touchdown pass from Kellen Moore to his brother Kirby Moore for Kirby's first career TD. When asked about the brother to brother connection, Boise State head coach Chris Petersen said, &quot;When that happened on the sideline, I think everyone just had a smile on their face. Itâs so hard to play
Division I football and then to be able to do that with your brother is something that is really special. I just
think that thatâs a special thing to play college football with your brother, and when you hook up for a big play
like that, and hopefully theyâll be many more down the road.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nmnathletics.com//pdf5/652781.pdf?ATCLID=204825096&amp;SPSID=48553&amp;SPID=4061&amp;DB_OEM_ID=9900&lt;/ref&gt; Boise State led only 10â7 with less the a minute left in the 1st half until Kellen Moore found Mitch Burroughs on a 18 yard TD pass then scored on a Moore 1 yard TD run after a San Jose fumble to lead 24â7 at halftime. Austin Pettis caught a 8 yard TD pass to open the 3rd quarter and now has a TD reception in all 8 games this season. Kyle Wilson returned an interception 27 yards for the defence's 2nd TD of the year. A late Doug Martin TD run capped off the Bronco scoring. Kellen Moore added 3 more TD passes and now has 24 with only 2 INT's. The Broncos moved up in the AP (#5) and Harris polls (#4 including 1 first place vote) and remained the same in the Coache's (#5) and BCS (#7).

''12th meeting. 7â4 all time. Last meeting in 2008, a 35â3 Broncos win in Boise.'' 

Boise State has always played exciting, close games when they travel to Ruston, Louisiana, and 2009 was no different as the Broncos had to hold on late for a 45â35 win against the upset-minded Bulldogs. The Broncos looked as if they were going to run away the game, building a lead of 27â7 at halftime with the help of big plays from Titus Young (40 yard TD reception) and Kyle Wilson (59 yard punt return to the 3 to set up a Doug Martin TD). But mistakes loomed large as Kellen Moore was intercepted and returned 75 yards for a TD and Kyle Brotzman missed 2 of his 5 field goals (29, 34, 25 made. 44, 31 missed). Tech got as close as 30â28 before the Kellen Moore connected with Austin Pettis for a 12 yard TD and Jeremy Avery broke a 44 yard TD run to extend the lead to 45â28. Tech would add a late TD to bring final to 45â35. Kellen Moore threw for a season high 354 yards and added 3 more TDs to bring his total to 27 on the season with only 3 INTs. Austin Pettis now has a TD catch in all 9 games this season and has 10 total for the year. Kyle Wilson recorded his second INT in as many weeks. The Broncos would fall in the Coaches, AP and Harris polls but rose one spot in the BCS to now be ranked #6 in every poll.

The Broncos won their 11th straight game against their in-state rival to remain undefeated on the season with a 63â25 win.

Add a 1 YD TD run by Jeremy Avery and a 100+ yard Titus Young kickoff return for a TD to bring the Broncos lead to 42â17 at halftime. Kyle Wilson opened the second half scoring by returning an INT 71 yards for his second TD ruturn of the season. Matt Kaiserman found Kyle Efaw for an 11 YD halfback pass TD before Moore found Pettis for a TD for the 4th time (14 YDS). Kellen Moore finished 22/32 for 299 and 5 TDS to bring his season total to 32 with only 3 INTS. Austin Pettis finished with 8 Receptions for 123 YDS and 4 TDS, brought his TD streak to 10 games and set a school record with 14 TD receptions for the season.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nmnathletics.com//pdf4/656074.pdf?ATCLID=204833833&amp;SPSID=48553&amp;SPID=4061&amp;DB_OEM_ID=9900&lt;/ref&gt; The Broncos intercepted Vandal quarterback Brian Reader 5 times and recovered 2 fumbles to record 7 turnovers.

''36th meeting. 23â12 all time. Last meeting in 2008, a 41â34 Broncos win in Reno.''

On November 23, this game was named the Allstate Sugar Bowl Manning Award Matchup of the Week for the matchup of Boise State QB Kellen Moore vs Nevada QB [[Colin Kaepernick]].&lt;ref&gt;http://allstatesugarbowl.org/site.php?pageID=19&amp;newsID=107&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevada came into the game on an eight game win streak and 7â0 in the WAC and looked to knock off the Broncos to win the outright WAC championship, but the undefeated Broncos set the tone early and often on their way to at least a share of their seventh WAC title in eight years. Titus Young took the games opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, his second return TD in three weeks, and the Broncos would add two TD passes to seldom used fullback Dan Paul to led 20â0 at the end of the first quarter. After a Wolf Pack field goal, Paul added his third TD reception to give the Broncos their largest lead of the game 27â3. Nevada would keep the game close by scoring two TDs before halftime to be down by 11 but could only match the Broncos point for point in the second half to lose 44â33. The Broncos held the nations leading rushing attack to only 242 yards and Kaepernick was held to only 172 total yards. Moore added five more TDs to bring his season total to 38, which set a new school record for TD passes in a season, passing the old record of 35. The Broncos stayed at #6 for the fourth straight week in every major poll and with [[2009 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]]'s win over [[2009 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]], Boise State became the front runner to receive an at large bid to a [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] bowl game.

On November 30, wide receiver Titus Young was named the WAC special teams player of the week,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=10100&amp;ATCLID=204841940&lt;/ref&gt; marking the third time he has won the award this season. Wide receiver Austin Pettis, who leads the team with 14 TD catches, broke his leg on the Broncos failed two point conversion after their second TD. He did return and played sparingly in the Broncos bowl game. Starting linebacker Daron Mackey tore his ACL and missed the remainder of the season.

On December 6 the Broncos were selected to play 12â0 and BCS #4 [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] in the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Tostitos Fiesta Bowl]]. This will be Boise State's second BCS appearance with the other being the [[2007 Fiesta Bowl]]. TCU earned the nonâautomatic qualifiers automatic bid by being the highest ranked team from a non BCS conference. Boise State became the first team from a non BCS conference to earn an at large bid to a BCS bowl. The Fiesta Bowl will also be the first BCS bowl to feature two teams from non-automatic BCS qualifying conferences and the first to feature two undefeated teams outside of the National Championship game.

''3rd meeting. 1â1 all time. Last meeting in 2008, a 17â16 Horned Frogs win in the [[2008 Poinsettia Bowl|Poinsettia Bowl]].''

The Broncos reached into their bag of tricks once again on the biggest of stages to help pull out a 17â10 victory over TCU to avenge their only loss in the 2008 season and win their second Fiesta Bowl championship. In a game dominated by defense the Broncos would strike first with a Brandyn Thompson 51 yard interception return for a touchdown. Kyle Brotzman, who had earlier in the game missed a 36 yard field goal, connected on a 40 yard field goal to extend the lead to 10â0. TCU's [[Andy Dalton (American football)|Andy Dalton]] threw a 30 yard TD pass to Curtis Clay right before halftime to make the score 10â7 at the break. A third quarter 29 yard TCU field goal would tie the game. Both teams went back and forth into the fourth quarter until Boise State pulled off a gutsy call that opened the game up. On fourth and nine on their own 33 yard line the Broncos executed a fake punt for a first down with a 29 yard pass from Kyle Brotzman to Kyle Efaw. Three straight completions by Kellen Moore put the Broncos on the 2 yard line where Doug Martin dove into the endzone for a 17â10 lead. Brotzman came up clutch two more times as he made a touchdown saving tackle on a punt return with about five minutes to play and punted the ball to the one yard line with only 1:06 to play. The Horned Frogs would have had to go 99 yards to tie the game. TCU drove to the Broncos 30 yard line before Dalton was intercepted by Winston Venable to seal the win with 18 seconds to play. Brandyn Thompson was named the games defensive MVP with 2 interceptions, 1 for a TD, and 7 tackles. Kyle Efaw was named the games offensive MVP with 4 receptions for 75 yards and caught the pass on the fake punt. The 14 wins is the most in school history and only the second 14â0 season in NCAA history (2002 Ohio State, the winner of the 2010 BCS National Championship, Alabama, also was 14â0).
