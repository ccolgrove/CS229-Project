The '''Dominion War''' is an extended plot concept developed in a number of [[story arc]]s of  ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', an American science-fiction television series produced by [[Paramount Pictures]].  In the fictional ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, the Dominion War is a conflict between the forces of the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]], [[Cardassian Union]] and, later, the [[Breen (Star Trek)|Breen Confederacy]] against the [[Alpha Quadrant]] alliance of the [[United Federation of Planets]], [[Klingon Empire]] and, later, the [[Romulan Star Empire]].

The primary setting of much of the series is aboard the fictional [[Starfleet]] controlled space station [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], located above the planet [[Bajor]]. In the series this space station is situated near a [[Bajoran wormhole|wormhole]] which provided instantaneous travel to the [[Gamma Quadrant]], a region on the other side of the galaxy. During season two of Deep Space Nine, the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] is introduced. Over the course of season two and three more information is introduced, until the conflict escalated in season four, particularly in the episodes [[Homefront (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|''Homefront'']] and [[Paradise Lost (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|''Paradise Lost'']]. The Dominion War arcs present themes that challenge the values of the characters in a manner not attempted in earlier series of ''Star Trek'', and have received a mixed critical response. Developing the plot of the Dominion War also altered the manner in which the series was scripted, shifting the emphasis from an episodic to a serialized narrative format.

==Synopsis==
{{Main|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine}}

In &quot;[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]&quot;, the pilot episode, the [[United Federation of Planets]] dispatches [[Benjamin Sisko|Commander Benjamin Sisko]] to take command of the space station [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]].&lt;ref name=Emissary&gt;{{cite episode|title=Emissary|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/emissary-part-i|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writer: [[Michael Piller]]. Story: Michael Piller and [[Rick Berman]]. Creators: Rick Berman and Michael Piller|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=1993-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station is located near a [[Bajoran Wormhole|stable wormhole]] located in the [[Alpha Quadrant]], which leads to the [[Gamma Quadrant]] of the [[Milky Way|Milky Way Galaxy]], nearly 70,000 light years away. Deep Space Nine is moved from the orbit of the planet [[Bajor]] to the Alpha Quadrant terminus of the wormhole to lay claim. Starships begin to enter the wormhole to explore, colonize and trade. The crews on the ships were unaware that they are entering a region of space controlled by the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]], a union of planets ordered by force and intimidation.&lt;ref name=Emissary/&gt;

Deep Space Nine's [[Ferengi]] bartender, [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]], makes contact with the [[Vorta]], a Dominion member race. However, he and Sisko are captured by the [[Jem'Hadar]], the soldiers of the Dominion. The Alpha Quadrant group is rescued, but the Federation ship USS ''Odyssey'' is lost in the attempt to return home, and colonies are destroyed as a warning not to re-enter Dominion space. Later, it is revealed that a race of [[shapeshifter]]s, known as &quot;[[Changeling (Star Trek)|Founders]]&quot;, are the rulers of the Dominion, and that [[Odo (Star Trek)|Constable Odo]] is of this species. Members of the [[Cardassia]]n [[Obsidian Order]] and the [[Romulan]] [[Tal Shiar]] intelligence factions plan to eradicate the Founders and their homeworld, but are themselves deceived by a shapeshifter and ambushed.

The Founders initiate a campaign of sabotage and terror against the Alpha Quadrant, which leaves many governments fearful of infiltrators, who are able to assume any physical form. When Earth is attacked, a band of [[Starfleet]] officers illegally attempt to impose [[martial law]] at the heart of the Federation. The [[Klingon Empire]] invades Cardassia in the inaccurate assumption that the Dominion is influencing its government. Later, the Federation suspects the Klingon Chancellor, [[Gowron]], of being a shapeshifter. This turned out to be a ploy by the Dominion so that the Federation would assassinate Gowron and further intensify the rift between the Federation and Klingons due to the Klingon invasion of Cardassia. During the assassination attempt, the Federation realized that Klingon [[General Martok]] was the actual shapeshifter. It would turn out that Martok, Dr. [[Julian Bashir]] and others have been held captive at a prison camp in the Gamma Quadrant while shapeshifters took their place in the Alpha Quadrant. Shortly before their escape, the Dominion succeeds in urging the Cardassians to enter an alliance during the confusion, establishing its presence in the Alpha Quadrant. Realizing the danger, the Federation and Klingons join forces to slow the Dominion build-up, co-operating to plant a minefield across the entrance to the Bajoran Wormhole as a rescued Martok is assigned as a permanent Klingon commander at Deep Space Nine.

Nevertheless, the Dominion begins to advance, and seizes control of Deep Space Nine. After a brief retreat, Sisko executes a successful return to the space station, but the wider conflict continues. More setbacks hinder the Alpha Quadrant alliance as additional races, such as the [[Breen (Star Trek)|Breen]], offer their support to the Dominion. Questionable tactics are adopted in the search for victory, including the dissemination of an [[Biological warfare|engineered virus]] among the Founders by a shadow Federation group called [[Section 31]]. A ruse involving a murder is used to enlist the help of the Romulans against the Dominion, and dissatisfactions lead the Cardassian leader, [[Legate Damar]], to launch a successful resistance movement against his former Dominion comrades. Eventually, the Dominion is forced back to the planet Cardassia Prime where it is cut off from reinforcements. The female shapeshifter in command informs Odo that they would fight to the end in order to prevent any counter-attack by the alliance into the Gamma Quadrant. Odo assures her that the Federation would not do that while the other parties would be too weak to. After linking together, Odo cures the female shapeshifter of the biological disease afflicting her and the other Founders with the antidote he received and the Dominion agrees to surrender.

==Conception==
{{Main|Dominion (Star Trek)}}

In 2002, ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' producer [[Ira Steven Behr]] stated that unlike some plots, which originated from a single small idea, the creation of the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] villain and [[story arc]] was &quot;very much thought out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth_and_Beyond&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=Behr, Wolfe, Piller|title=The Birth of the Dominion and Beyond|date=2003|medium=''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' Season Three DVD Special Features|publisher=Paramount Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behr said that the earliest mention of the Dominion was purposely planted in the comic Season Two [[Ferengi]] episode, &quot;[[Rules of Acquisition (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rules of Acquisition]]&quot;, to leave the audience with an impression of &quot;how important could it be?&quot; It was decided that the [[Gamma Quadrant]] would need an ambiance that would distinguish it from the Alpha Quadrant. The producers wanted to portray the region as something other than &quot;uncharted space&quot;, and avoid imitating the adventures of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' with another series of plots focusing primarily on themes of exploration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp97&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=97|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 18 months of ''Deep Space Nine'' exposition, the producers decided to characterize The Dominion as &quot;anti-[[United Federation of Planets|Federation]]&quot;. Writer and script editor [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] has explained that this move also distinguished ''Deep Space Nine'' from its successor series, ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', which stars a [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|lost Federation ship]] traversing the chaotic and divided [[Delta Quadrant]] of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth_and_Beyond&quot;/&gt;

Instead of introducing one alien race, three were introduced simultaneously: the [[Changeling (Star Trek)|Changelings]], the [[Vorta]] and the [[Jem'Hadar]]. These three were intended to represent the front of an ancient civilization coupled together by fear, to contrast with the unity of the Federation enabled by bonds of friendship. Behr, Wolfe, writer [[Peter Allan Fields]] and Jim Crocker attended meetings to develop the concepts of these species and found general inspiration in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' Trilogy]] novels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp153&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=153|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[Michael Piller]] suggested the idea that the Founders of the Dominion be the race to which [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] belongs, toward the end of Season Two production, and discovered that Behr and Wolfe had also discussed this possibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth_and_Beyond&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionpp158-159&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|pages=158â159|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt; This character had been introduced with no knowledge of his true origins. Piller asserts the endeavor to create a new villain was one of the most difficult tasks he undertook in his work on ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth_and_Beyond&quot;/&gt; Wolfe perceives similarities between the fictional Founders and the [[Roman Empire]], in that the species first uses diplomacy, deception and cultural imperialism to achieve their aims before ultimately resorting to coercion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp167&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=167|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]]: &quot;[The Founders, like the Roman Empire] would rather take over someplace without firing a shot, but they're going to take over ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer [[Ronald D. Moore]], co-creator [[Rick Berman]] originally intended the Dominion War to be the focus of three or four episodes, but Behr intended to expand the plotline all along. Moore has stated that Berman sometimes questioned the writing staff about the [[Media violence research|degree of violence]] included in some episodes. Berman also expressed concern about the portrayal of long-term consequences for the main characters, such as the loss of a character's leg in Season Seven. The writers argued in favor of the increased violence, asserting that it was justified in view of the plotlines detailing the progression of the Dominion War.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN p8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/444/444306p8.html|title=An Interview with Ron Moore|page=8|accessdate=May 8, 2010|date=December 4, 1993|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piller supported the idea that the repercussions of past episodes should continue to be felt, and that characters should &quot;learn that actions have consequences&quot;, even if such consequences were to lead off in directions Piller had not originally imagined when ''Deep Space Nine'' remained in the conceptual stages.&lt;ref name=&quot;boldnew&quot;&gt;[[Michael Piller]]: ''A Bold New Beginning'' Featurette [''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' Season One DVD Special Features].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TrekWeb Ira Behr p2&quot;/&gt; Moore has stated that the filming of ''Star Trek: Voyager'' occupied more of Berman and Piller's time from ''Deep Space Nine''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s third season, which allowed Behr to defend his creative decisions more successfully.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN p7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/444/444306p7.html|title=An Interview with Ron Moore|page=7|accessdate=April 4, 2011|date=December 4, 1993|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', the writing staff could dedicate more time to working on scripts for ''Deep Space Nine''. The writers admired the scripting techniques used for ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'': Moore cites the 1967 episode &quot;[[Errand of Mercy]]&quot; as a strong influence on his treatment of the Dominion War.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN p3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/444/444306p8.html|title=An Interview with Ron Moore|page=3|accessdate=May 8, 2010|date=December 4, 1993|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The plot of the Dominion War is presented in a succession of shorter [[story arc]]s which span Seasons Two to Seven of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and are linked editorially by the decisions of the producers and writers.

===Season Two: introducing the Dominion===
After conceptual meetings, the writers began to introduce allusions to the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] into episodes of Season Two. The intention was to gradually increase the audience's awareness that there was a large and pervasive [[polity]] at work behind apparently innocuous events in the [[Gamma Quadrant]]. The Dominion and its methods are revealed across three episodes of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp73&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=73|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Rules of Acquisition (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rules of Acquisition]]&quot; marks the first mention of the Dominion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Rules of Acquisition|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/rules-of-acquisition|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writer: [[Ira Steven Behr]]. Story: Hilary Bader. Creators: [[Rick Berman]] and [[Michael Piller]]|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=1993-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Ferengi]] character [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] hears whispers of a powerful union of civilizations in the Gamma Quadrant with which he may be able to trade. Dialogue that seems inconsequential within the framework of a light-hearted episode was planned to ultimately create major change in the dynamics of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth_and_Beyond&quot;/&gt;

As Alpha Quadrant races begin to colonize planets in the Gamma Quadrant and their presence becomes known, disturbing reports indicate that what the Dominion cannot attain through trade is forcibly seized. These reports are justified in &quot;[[Sanctuary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Sanctuary]]&quot;, when a large fleet of Skrreea ships appears in the Alpha Quadrant, in search of a new homeworld in light of the conquest of their original planet by Dominion forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sanctuary|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/sanctuary|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writer: Frederick Rappaport. Story: Kelley Miles and Gabe Essoe. Creators: [[Rick Berman]] and [[Michael Piller]]|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=1993-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actions of the Dominion are contrasted with the reactions of the regular characters to the Skrreea refugees. Executive producer [[Michael Piller]] has suggested that the plot evoked real-world debate surrounding [[Proposition 187]], a Californian law concerning the rights of [[Alien (law)|illegal aliens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp106&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=106|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finale of Season Two, &quot;[[The Jem'Hadar]]&quot;, permitted writer [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] to surprise the audience, and challenge their opinions concerning the safety of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] and [[Starfleet]], when the USS ''Odyssey'', a [[Galaxy class starship|''Galaxy''-class starship]] similar to the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise'']] from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', is outfought and destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birth_and_Beyond&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionpp154-155&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|pages=154â5|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]]: &quot;We wanted to show the long-term fans how dangerous these guys were. And it's my belief that if that had been the ''Enterprise'' and not the ''Odyssey'', and [Jean-Luc] Picard rather than Keogh in command, it still wouldn't have survived.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion is revealed to be a ruthless empire, using &quot;[[carrot and stick]]&quot; methods to control others, with three distinct races performing crucial roles.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]]: ''The Birth of the Dominion and Beyond'' Documentary [''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' Season Three DVD Special Features]. Paramount, ASIN: B00008KA5A, June 3, 1993: &quot;The Gamma Quadrant isn't empty, it isn't just a bunch of planets. It's bound together by the Dominion, a very, very tough, very smart, very old civilization, run by the mysterious Founders, who are experts in genetic engineering, and who turn out to be Odo's people, the shapeshifters. They then go and engineer these slave races that do their bidding. Essentially, the two main slave races were the 'carrot' and the 'stick'. The carrot being the Vorta, who would come to your planet and say, 'Hey, you're nice people, here's some M16s and some popcorn, and whatever else you want, baby: alcohol, fire-water? All you have to do is sign this little contract and we'll make you cool.' Then there's the Jem'Hadar. So the Vorta say, 'Oh, you don't want to play ball? Then meet these guys. They're gonna kick your asses.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion's [[Jem'Hadar]] [[shock troops]] capture [[Benjamin Sisko|Commander Sisko]], Quark and an alien named Eris, who is later identified as a [[double agent]] and one of the [[Vorta]], the Dominion's negotiators and administrators. The Jem'Hadar send a Jem'Hadar representative to [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] with the message that no further intrusions into Dominion space will be tolerated, and to hand [[Kira Nerys|Major Kira Nerys]] a list of colonies and ships already eliminated for trespassing. The Federation dispatches a rescue team that returns Sisko's group to the station, but while retreating back to the Alpha Quadrant a Jem'Hadar ship launches a [[kamikaze]] run against the ''Odyssey'', resulting in the destruction of both ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jem'Hadar&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Jem'Hadar|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/jemhadar-the|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Story: [[Ira Steven Behr]]. Creators: [[Rick Berman]] and [[Michael Piller]]|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=1994-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season Three: introducing the Founders===
With the third season, [[Ronald D. Moore]] and others started to write regularly for ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' following the completion of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN p7&quot;/&gt; [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] joined [[Ira Steven Behr]] in scripting episodes developing the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] plotline, beginning with &quot;[[The Search (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Search]]&quot;. Behr became full executive producer at the midpoint of the season, after the departure of [[Michael Piller]].

In the two-part season opener, &quot;The Search&quot;, [[Benjamin Sisko|Commander Sisko]] returns from [[Starfleet]] Headquarters on Earth with a [[Defiant class starship|''Defiant''-class]] prototype starship, the [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Search, Part I&quot;/&gt; Executive producer [[Rick Berman]] had to be convinced that the introduction of the ''Defiant'' would not distract the audience from the [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|main starship]] of the latest ''[[Star Trek]]'' production, ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. The decision was made on the basis that a ship was needed to provide an avenue for stories set off the [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] space station, and that such a vessel would need the potential to oppose the [[Jem'Hadar]], who had already been portrayed obliterating large ships. Audience research had also suggested that young male viewers were hoping for more action-oriented episodes with greater jeopardy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp158&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=158|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season Three's Dominion stories explore the connection between [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] and his people, and their conflicting attitudes toward &quot;solid&quot; sentient lifeforms. The ''Defiant'' enters the [[Gamma Quadrant]] on a peace mission to locate the [[Changeling (Star Trek)|Founders]] in &quot;The Search&quot;, and it is discovered that the Founders are of the same race as Odo. Despite a burning desire to return to his home, he finds his people's philosophy â that which you can control cannot hurt you â abhorrent, and asks to return to the Alpha Quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twiztv.com/scripts/ds9/season3/ds9-302.txt|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080502202855/http://www.twiztv.com/scripts/ds9/season3/ds9-302.txt|archivedate= May 2, 2008|title=Script for &quot;The Search, Part II&quot;|publisher=twiztv.com|month=July|year=1994|accessdate=April 23, 2010}} Act 5, Scene 74.

Another facet to the Dominion was evaluated more closely in Season Three â the Jem'Hadar. In &quot;[[The Abandoned (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Abandoned]]&quot;, a juvenile Jem'Hadar is found alone and matures under Odo's guidance. The crew of Deep Space Nine witnesses the Jem'Hadar's difficulty in adjusting to a society with rules different to those of his native culture. [[Avery Brooks]], directing this episode, has emphasised the story as a metaphor for African-American adolescents in the 20th century and their struggles with addiction and violence, their integration into American society, and the manner in which their upbringing might contribute to these problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp180a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=180a|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Avery Brooks]]: &quot;For me, it was very much a story about young brown men, and, to some extent, a story about a society that is responsible for the creation of a generation of young men who are feared, who are addicted, who are potential killers ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks ensured that Odo continues to support the maturing Jem'Hadar despite the alien's regression to Dominion custom, as a commentary on how modern society should engage with young people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp180b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=180|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Avery Brooks]]: &quot;Odo knows that this is still a child, and for him to give up and just let the boy go â what kind of a statement would we be making? That these people are expendable, that we don't really care about them? Those are the hard questions to answer.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Improbable Cause]]&quot; initiates a two-part adventure concerning the search for the Founders' homeworld which concludes in &quot;[[The Die is Cast (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Die is Cast]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Improbable Cause&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Improbable Cause|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/improbable-cause|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writer: [[RenÃ© Echevarria]].

The Dominion successfully lure the fleets of the Tal Shiar and the Obsidian Order into a trap, eliminating both organizations. The plot establishes an atmosphere of suspicion amongst the Alpha Quadrant powers, initiated by the shapeshifters' abilities to assume other identities, which forms the basis of plots for Season Four.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Die is Cast&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Die is Cast|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/die-is-cast-the|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writer: [[Ronald D. Moore]]. Creators: [[Rick Berman]] and [[Michael Piller]]|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=1995-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Season Three finale turned out to differ significantly from the production staff's conceptual vision. [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] did not favor the idea of a season-end [[cliffhanger]] which would have revealed the presence of shapeshifters on Earth. To continue the theme of paranoia about shapeshifters and the Dominion, &quot;[[The Adversary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Adversary]]&quot; was instead scripted to set up a hunt for a Founder aboard the ''Defiant'', incorporating some narrative elements at first intended to commence Season Four, while offering a more self-contained plot and using existing sets to reduce production costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp250&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=250|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season Four: Founder infiltration and political destabilization===
[[Rick Berman]], [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] and [[Ira Steven Behr]] originally expected to open Season Four with the two-part adventure, postponed from the end of Season Three, that ultimately became &quot;[[Homefront (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Homefront]]&quot; and &quot;[[Paradise Lost (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Paradise Lost]]&quot;. [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] determined that the writers needed to come up with a much different opener to satisfy the audience, but without giving specific instructions. The production staff decided to begin a plotline based around suspicions between the Federation and the [[Klingons]], finally leading to conflict between the former allies, which was inspired by a line from the Season Three episode &quot;[[The Die is Cast (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Die is Cast]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionpp255-256a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|pages=255â6|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Ira Steven Behr]]: &quot;A shapeshifter in that episode says something like, 'In the future, all we have to worry about is the Klingons and the Federation, and that won't be for much longer.' I'd said to Ron at the time, 'You know, we could do a whole show about that ...' But the earth didn't move. Nothing shook.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; With the Klingons set to reappear, Berman suggested the return of a character from ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' â the Klingon [[Worf]] â as a permanent officer aboard [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionpp255-256&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|pages=255â6|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Ira Steven Behr]]: &quot;Rick [Berman] said, 'The Klingons â that's the way to go. Everyone loves the Klingons. And if we bring in the Klingons, why don't we bring back Worf?'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; While both the new plot and character offered interesting possibilities, the producers felt that their vision for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' was put off-course for almost one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp256&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=256|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Ira Steven Behr]]: &quot;We only recovered our equilibrium in the middle of the fifth season, following another meeting with the studio in which we said, 'How about making the Klingons our friends again? You'll see them as much as you want, but we want to get back to the Dominion.' While I like having brought Worf onto the show ... I think it had a fairly substantial impact ... It took us way off from where we'd intended to go and it was slow going getting back.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Season Four begins with &quot;[[The Way of the Warrior (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Way of the Warrior]]&quot;, which marks the arrival of Worf. This episode is one of a few in this season to explore themes of suspicion and paranoia, and their effect upon societies and relationships, building up to &quot;Homefront&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. After the events of &quot;The Die is Cast&quot;, fear about the identities of the infiltrator [[Changeling (Star Trek)|shapeshifters]] leads the Klingons to suspect Dominion involvement in the new [[Cardassian]] civilian government. Their refusal to break off an invasion, even after Dominion involvement has been disproved, results in a military confrontation and diplomatic breakdown, and the Klingons attempt to seize Deep Space Nine. This seems to further the Founders' goal of the destabilization of the [[Alpha Quadrant]] as a prelude to their own invasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Way of the Warrior|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/way-of-the-warrior-the-part-i|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Story: [[Ira Steven Behr]] and [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]].

In &quot;[[Hippocratic Oath (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Hippocratic Oath]]&quot;, the characters of [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] and [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Chief O'Brien]] debate curing a group of [[Jem'Hadar]] soldiers of an addiction in the hope that they will rebel against the Dominion. There is discussion about the identity of the true enemy, the limits of duty, and whether soldiers are responsible for the actions of their leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hippocratic Oath&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Hippocratic Oath|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/hippocratic-oath|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writer: Lisa Klink.

===Season Five: build-up to all-out war===
In the fifth season, the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] invasion of the [[Alpha Quadrant]] gathers pace, appearing in episodes such as &quot;[[Apocalypse Rising]]&quot;, &quot;[[In Purgatory's Shadow]]&quot;, &quot;[[By Inferno's Light]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Blaze of Glory (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Blaze of Glory]]&quot;. [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] and [[Ira Steven Behr]] were again responsible for the major Season Five episodes concerning the Dominion.&lt;ref name=&quot;In Purgatory's Shadow&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=In Purgatory's Shadow|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/in-purgatorys-shadow|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writers: [[Ira Steven Behr]] and [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]].

In the Season Five opener, &quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot;, [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] discovers that his race are capable of deceiving their own kind as well as &quot;solids&quot; when he is led to believe that Klingon Chancellor [[Gowron]] is a [[Changeling (Star Trek)|Changeling]] instead of the General, [[Martok]]. This plot was planned to shift the focus of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episodes back toward the struggle with the Dominion, which had been postponed in earlier production discussions with [[Paramount Television|Paramount]] in favor of bringing [[Worf]] and a [[Klingon]]-based plotline into the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp359&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=359|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Ira Steven Behr]]: &quot;Season Four threw us for a loop, with the whole Klingon thing, and bringing Worf into the show. So the seminal thing about our fifth season opener was that we wanted to get back on the track we'd anticipated being on a year earlier. We were moving back toward making the shapeshifters and the Dominion our enemies. Not the Klingons. I didn't want to have the Klingons as our enemies ... We wanted to let people know that we didn't switch horse in midstream. So &quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot; was an important episode. By having that shapeshifter in there, we were saying, 'Season Four wasn't a mistake. It wasn't the Klingons turning against us. There was a shapeshifter behind it all along.' And that's why we had to do that episode.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Apocalypse Rising|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/apocalypse-rising|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Story: [[Ira Steven Behr]] and [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]]. Creators: [[Rick Berman]] and [[Michael Piller]]|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=1996-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;In Purgatory's Shadow&quot;, it is discovered that [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] has been kidnapped, imprisoned for weeks and in the interim replaced by a Changeling. The [[shapeshifter]] double sabotages efforts to close the Wormhole, and attempts to destroy the Bajoran sun, leaving the path open for Dominion fleets to enter the Alpha Quadrant.&lt;ref name=&quot;In Purgatory's Shadow&quot;/&gt; In the following episode, &quot;By Inferno's Light&quot;, the [[Cardassian]]s become a member of the Dominion, and the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] and Klingon Empire resolve to cast aside their mutual distrust and unite against the common threat. A garrison of Klingon troops is stationed on [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]], under the command of the real General [[Martok]], rescued from Dominion incarceration with Bashir.&lt;ref name=&quot;By Inferno's Light&quot;/&gt; In &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, the characters confront the issue of [[ethnic cleansing]] when the [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] â a resistance group of former Federation citizens now living in Cardassian space â are hunted down and ask for the assistance of [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]], who used to criticize their methods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;/&gt;

The Season Five finale, &quot;[[Call to Arms (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Call to Arms]]&quot;, sets the scene for the commencement of full-scale war between the Dominion and the Federation during the final two seasons of ''Deep Space Nine''. When the Dominion begins to send ships through the Wormhole, the Alpha Quadrant allies build a minefield at its mouth to cut off the supply line. The plot considers whether it is better for the planet [[Bajor]] to stand with their Federation friends or remain neutral in the coming war to protect themselves. Sisko persuades them that [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] is the favorable course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Call to Arms&quot;/&gt;

===Season Six: the war rages===
Season Six, charting the turmoil of the Dominion War, faces themes of the moral dilemmas of conflict. New plot elements permitted ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' to examine themes in a manner unlike preceding ''[[Star Trek]]'' productions, as characters are forced to re-evaluate their beliefs. The production staff resolved to start the season with a six-episode arc, the first attempted in the history of the ''Star Trek'' franchise.

[[Rick Berman]] originally pictured that the Dominion War would last for a limited number of episodes before a prompt resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/A_Time_to_Stand_(episode)|title=Interview with Ronald D. Moore about &quot;A Time to Stand&quot; for Memory Alpha|publisher=memory-alpha.org|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}: &quot;The initial thinking was that we would end Season Five on a cliffhanger with the Federation plunged into war, and then we would come back and do a multi-episode arc, and the war would last that long.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Planning the arc, [[Ira Steven Behr]], [[Ronald D. Moore]] and the writers conceived a longer chain of first five, then six connected episodes, stretching from &quot;[[A Time to Stand]]&quot; to &quot;[[Sacrifice of Angels (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Sacrifice of Angels]]&quot;, as themes increased demands for greater narrative development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp475-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|pages=475â6|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp494&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=494|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt; No writer had previously contributed to a series involving arcs of such length, and Moore, Behr and novice scripting partner, supervising producer [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]], have all stated that the writing process changed as a result, with more production collaboration and interaction than for earlier seasons of ''Deep Space Nine''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp476a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=476|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Ronald D. Moore]]: &quot;We broke the six episodes together, but as everybody went off and worked on writing them, things would start to change or shift. It became a much more interactive process than it ever had been before. Because each detail had a domino effect. We'd had that happen before, to a certain extent, but we'd never done this many episodes with this many continuing storylines as a single piece. We weren't used to the rhythm. It was definitely challenging!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp486a&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=486|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]]: &quot;It changed the dynamic of the way we work and it changed the kind of involvement that everybody had. Because RenÃ© Echevarria or Ronald D. Moore would go away to work on an episode, and discover something in the writing process that was going to change everybody else's script. One of them would be coming back all the time saying, 'You know what guys? We need to re-think.' And then we'd call in all the troops and re-think the storyline.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp486b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=486|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Ira Steven Behr]]: &quot;The guys were coming in saying, 'What are you writing?' 'Are we gonna do this?' 'Where's Kira at right now?' 'What's Odo doing?' There were a lot of phone calls, a lot of running into each other's offices, a lot of 'Should this go before this?' and 'Wait a second â does this track?' The fact is, the show isn't geared to work like that.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The potential for serialization that [[Rick Berman]] had perceived from the start of ''Deep Space Nine'' came to fruition as a result of the multiple plotlines accumulating to form the Dominion War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp475-6&quot;/&gt;

The return of [[Gul Dukat]] as commander of the Dominion-controlled [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] enabled the writers to contrast the space station of the audience's imagination to its incarnation as a former [[Cardassian]] mining facility. Former resistance fighter [[Major Kira]] is portrayed re-considering her ethical code as she sets out on the path to collaboration in &quot;[[Rocks and Shoals (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rocks and Shoals]]&quot;, but the suicide of a [[Bajoran]] monk reminds her of the reality of her situation. Through &quot;Rocks and Shoals&quot;, ''Deep Space Nine'' also revisits themes of the war conduct as [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] considers the morality of ambushing soldiers whom superiors have forsaken, only for events to force his hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Rocks and Shoals|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/who-mourns-for-morn|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writer: [[Ronald D.

Fortune is reversed again in Season Six as [[Starfleet]] re-captures Deep Space Nine in the closing episodes of the opening arc, &quot;[[Favor the Bold]]&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice of Angels&quot;. The [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']] stands alone in an attempt to hold back thousands of Dominion ships entering through the Wormhole. An intervention from the [[Wormhole Prophets]], considered gods by the Bajorans, leads characters to ponder questions of faith and destiny.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacrifice of Angels&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sacrifice of Angels|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/sacrifice-of-angels|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writers: [[Ira Steven Behr]] and [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]].

They [the Prophets] wouldn't have done this for just anyone. This was the man going out into the wilderness and demanding his god to interfere, to do something, for crying out loud. The corporeal characters had done so much in this episode; surely, they'd earned the help of the gods.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the fleet disappears and the Federation regains control of Deep Space Nine. The defeat costs Dukat his mental health, the life of his daughter, [[Tora Ziyal]], and his status as Cardassian leader. Dukat is the first but not the only character in Season Six to face the pain of loss in conflict. Later, in the season six finale [[Tears of the Prophets]], [[Worf]] loses his wife [[Jadzia Dax]] when she is killed by Dukat.

Although themes of death are apparent in ''Deep Space Nine''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s previous seasons, &quot;[[Far Beyond the Stars]]&quot; details how Sisko copes with the loss of a friend on a deeper psychological level. Experiencing visions of himself confronting racial discrimination against Black Americans in the 1950s, Sisko interprets useful parallels connected to his life on Deep Space Nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Far Beyond the Stars|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/far-beyond-the-stars|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writers: [[Ira Steven Behr]] and [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]].

Additionally, Season Six introduces [[Section 31]], a secret organization dedicated to preserving the Federation's principles regardless of the cost and legitimacy of its methods. In &quot;[[Inquisition (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Inquisition]]&quot;, the character of [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] refuses to join Section 31 and reports its actions, but still ponders its significance: &quot;But what would that say about us?

That when push comes to shove, we're willing to throw away our principles in order to survive?&quot; Sisko replies, &quot;I wish I had an answer for you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Inquisition|url=http://www.startrek.com/database_article/inquisition|series=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|serieslink=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|credits=Writers: [[Bradley Thompson]] and [[David Weddle]] Creators: [[Rick Berman]] and [[Michael Piller]]|network=[[UPN]]|airdate=1998-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twiztv.com/scripts/ds9/season6/ds9-618.txt|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080502203321/http://www.twiztv.com/scripts/ds9/season6/ds9-618.txt|archivedate = May 2008|title=Script for &quot;Inquisition&quot;|publisher=twiztv.com|accessdate=May 6, 2010}} Act Five, Scene 43.

===Season Seven: end of the war===
Season Seven charts further dilemmas of conflict. Following the example of Season Six, the writers considered using an arc to conclude the multiple Dominion War threads in satisfying fashion, deciding that ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' could not be concluded in one or two episodes alone.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]], ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion]]'', Pocket Books, 2000: &quot;It showed us the possibilities and the excitement that could be garnered, and in the end, we liked it so much that we decided to do the ten-episode arc at the end of the series.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp592b&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=592|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Rick Berman]]: &quot;So rather than tie up every thread in the few hours, we thought, 'Why not look at the last third of the season as a continuing, building conclusion to the seven-year story?'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; A ten-episode arc was outlined to end Season Seven, the Dominion War, and all of ''Deep Space Nine'', and more alterations were made as scripting progressed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companionp591-592&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|pages=591â2|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}} [[Ira Steven Behr]]: &quot;The show wasn't geared to be what we kept turning it into ...

The Treaty of Bajor is signed aboard Deep Space Nine in the Season Seven finale, &quot;[[What You Leave Behind (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|What You Leave Behind, Part II]]&quot;. The conclusion to the Dominion War arc formed the resolution to ''Deep Space Nine'' as a series, and a moment for the production staff to settle the destinies of the main characters.

===Former cast members and production staff===
In a 2007 interview with ''iF'' magazine, [[George Takei]], who played [[Hikaru Sulu]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' and its [[Star Trek (film series)|films]], described ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' as representing the &quot;polar opposite&quot; of [[Gene Roddenberry]]'s vision and philosophy of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2478|publisher=iF Magazine|author=Sean Elliot|title=Exclusive: George Takei Thanks Fans for 40 Years of ''Star Trek''|date=November 20, 2007|accessdate=November 20, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071123012040/http://ifmagazine.com/feature.asp?article=2478|archivedate = November 23, 2007 |accessdate = April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[D.C.

Roddenberry doubted that a series concentrating on themes of aside from [[space exploration]] could endure, and voiced displeasure with initial concepts for ''Deep Space Nine'' presented to him in 1991. [[Rick Berman]] has explained that Roddenberry, although terminally ill, had given him his blessing for its development, but that he had no opportunity to discuss any of the ideas with Roddenberry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deep Space Nine Companion&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=Pocket Books, Simon &amp; Schuster Inc|location=New York City|year=2000|page=3|isbn=1-0671-5010-62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
[[John J. O'Connor (journalist)|John J. O'Connor]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'' in January 1993, noted that pre-release advertisements for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' offered &quot;a new ''Star Trek'' era&quot; and added, &quot;Welcome to the Dark Side. The determinedly optimistic [[Gene Roddenberry|Mr. Roddenberry]] was partial to plots that made uplifting moral points. The new creators and executive producers, [[Rick Berman]] and [[Michael Piller]], are shooting, so to speak, for something more ambivalent, less perfect.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/07/arts/review-television-star-trek-leaps-to-the-24th-century-in-syndicated-series.html|publisher=The New York Times Company|author=John J.

He wrote, &quot;Inevitably, though, there is an element of exhaustion seeping through the concept. With the [[Cold War]] over, perhaps the Roddenberry optimism seems merely naive as headlines bring news of murderous divisions between [[Serbs]] and [[Muslim]]s, [[Kurds]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Israelis]] and [[Palestinians]], [[Irish Catholic]]s and [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestants]], and so on across an increasingly depressing globe. ''[[Star Trek]]'' offered a vision that leapt 300 years into the future.

Cynthia Littleton, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in 1998, summarized the ratings the series was receiving at the end of its sixth season: &quot;''Deep Space Nine'' may not go out on as high a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] note as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'', which wrapped a hugely successful run in 1994, but ''DS9'' is hardly floundering. The show, which bowed in January 1993, consistently ranks among the top three [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]] hours in household and demographic ratings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117479765|publisher=Variety.com|author=Cynthia Littleton|title=&quot;Deep Space&quot; on final ''Trek''|date=August 24, 1998|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 edition of the Australian science-fiction magazine ''Frontier'', Anthony Leong suggested that ''Deep Space Nine'' had not initially been envisaged to include a war [[story arc]] from the beginning. He demonstrated a preference for the manner in which the plot of ''[[Babylon 5]]'' had been devised, while acknowledging how the ''Deep Space Nine'' writers had developed a continuing plotline: &quot;... it is rare for a series creator to envision how the series will develop over time. Furthermore, the creative process in dramatic television writing tends to be organic, as events in the series will unfold based on the events that preceded it. For example, were the wars with the [[Klingon]]s and the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] on ''Deep Space Nine'' foreseen by its creators back in the first season? Of course not ... these events developed over time through the input of its writing staff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leong|first=Anthony|title=''Babylon 5'': Triumph and Tragedy in Three Acts|journal=Frontier: the Australian Science-Fiction Media Magazine|issue=15|publisher=K &amp; J Publishing|location=Carlton South, Victoria, Australia|date=1999-04|url=http://www.mediacircus.net/babylon5.html|issn=1326-8686|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Nader Elhefnawy, contributor to [[The Internet Review of Science Fiction]], asserted that, while less appreciated than other science-fiction series of the 1990s, ''Deep Space Nine'' had developed an interesting cast of characters, &quot;thanks to the Dominion War, much of the richest and most exciting drama in the ''Star Trek'' franchise's history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irosf.com/q/zine/article/10421|publisher=Bluejack|author=Nader Elhefnawy|editor=Stacey Janssen|title=The Golden Age of Science Fiction Television: Looking Back at SFTV During the Long 1990s|journal=The Internet Review of Science-Fiction|date=June 2008|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' was nominated at the [[Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films]] for a [[Saturn Award]], from 1997 to 2000, in the field of Best Genre Cable or Syndicated Series. It was nominated in technical and artistic categories at the [[Emmys]] in each season. [[Cinescape]] columnist Andrew Hershberger remarked in 2003 on the lack of critical success for science-fiction television: &quot;Nobody cool would dare vote for a sci-fi show [for Outstanding Drama Series] that didn't have [Stanley] [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick]] or [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]]'s name attached to it ... If ''Deep Space Nine'' was involved, you'd hear some real complaining on this end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trektoday.com/articles/trekking_to_the_emmys.shtml|publisher=Trek Nation|author=Caillan Davenport|title=Trekking to the Emmys|date=200-07-16|accessdate=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic perspectives===
Academics have noted how the Dominion War plotlines have explored the human psyche as much as outer space. Lincoln Geraghty praises the ending to the [[story arc]] and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' as a series, and believes this is indicative of how the series manipulates the ''[[Star Trek]]'' ethos, identifying a theme of ambiguity as part of its continuing narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=I.B. Tauris|first1=Lincoln|last1=Geraghty|title=Living with Star Trek: American Culture and the Star Trek Universe|isbn=978-1845112653|page=262|date=February 30, 2007|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karin Blair, writing in 1997 at the time of Season Five, felt that the series was reflecting trends for American culture to re-consider its place in the global community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=|author=Karin Blair|editor=Dan Jolin|title=Star Trek Old and New: From the Alien Embodied to the Alien Imagined|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social theorist Michele Barrett comments on the &quot;declining faith in [[rationalism]] that haunts ''Deep Space Nine''&quot; in her book ''Star Trek: The Human Frontier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Routledge|first1=Michele|last1=Barrett|first2=Duncan|last2=Barrett|title=Star Trek: The Human Frontier|isbn=0415929822|date=December 1, 2001|accessdate=May 16, 2010}} Back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Robert Jewett and [[John Shelton Lawrence]], authors of ''[[The Myth of the American Superhero]]'', argue that the Dominion War plotlines in ''Deep Space Nine'' continue ''Star Trek''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s portrayal of &quot;humanistic militarism&quot;, in that conflict is justified for the sake of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing Co|first1=Robert|last1=Jewett|first2=John|last2=Lawrence|title=The Myth of the American Superhero|isbn=978-0802849113|page=245|date=September 20, 2002|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism is levelled at [[Paramount Television|Paramount]]'s tie-in merchandising, in particular the slogan for the computer game ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars|Deep Space Nine: Dominion Wars]]'', which is considered to emphasize the combat element at the expense of other themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=William B Eerdmans Publishing Co|first1=Robert|last1=Jewett|first2=John|last2=Lawrence|title=The Myth of the American Superhero|isbn=978-0802849113|page=262|date=September 20, 2002|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While television commentators and fans have noted associations with the [[Yugoslav Wars]] in the 1990s, some academics have noted parallels between the portrayal of the Dominion War and other historical conflicts. Michele Barrett identifies a number of themes relating to [[World War I]] in ''Star Trek'', especially &quot;in the bleak and costly alliances and endless casualty sheets that characterize the protracted Dominion War in ''DS9''.&quot;&lt;ref name=HumanFrontierp66p72&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Routledge|first1=Michele|last1=Barrett|first2=Duncan|last2=Barrett|title=Star Trek: The Human Frontier|isbn=0415929822|date=December 1, 2001|pages=66, 72|accessdate=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
