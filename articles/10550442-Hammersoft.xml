{{Sri Lankan Conflict}}

'''''Eelam War III''''' is the name given to the third phase of armed conflict between Sri Lankan military and the separatist [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]. After the period of 100 days cease-fire the hostilities broke out on the 19th of April 1995. The LTTE - Sea Tigers  planted explosives in two gun boats known as SLNS 'Sooraya' and 'Ranasuru', and blew them up. Also, a new weapon &quot;Stinger&quot;, a shoulder launched anti-aircraft missile was used in this conflict by the LTTE. This was used to take down two Sri Lankan Air Force AVRO aircraft flying over the Jaffna peninsula.

{{main|Kallarawa massacre}}
The [[Kallarawa]] massacre is an incident on May 25, 1995 during which [[LTTE]] cadres massacred 42 [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] men, women and children in [[Kallarawa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/erc/democracy/1995_hrp_report/95hrp_report_sasia/SriLanka.html |title=Sri Lanka Human Rights Practices, 1995 |accessdate=1996-03-01 |work=U.S. Department of State}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;. All the remaining civilian survivors fled the village after this incident leading to its depopulation&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sunday Times1&quot;&gt;[http://sundaytimes.lk/981004/news2.html ''The Sunday Times'', Lighting a candle in the storm.]&lt;/ref&gt;. However survivors from the Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim communities have returned to Kallarawa under the protection of the Sri Lankan Army&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sunday Times1&quot;/&gt;.

===Gonagala massacre===

{{main|Gonagala massacre}}
The Gongala Massacre was a massacre that occurred on September 18, 1999, in the small village of Gonagala, located in the Ampara District of Sri Lanka. According to reports, over 50 men, women and children were hacked to death in the middle of the night. The massacre is attributed to the LTTE, which is banned as a terrorist organization by a number of countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, India and the European Union.

The Gonagala massacre is one of several such attacks believed to have been carried out by the LTTE. However these murders gained notoriety because, unlike previous attacks, most of the LTTE cadres who took part in it were women. According to survivors, there was a significant presence of female cadres among the 75 LTTE cadres who took part in the killings

== Controversy over the Army's handling of its casualties and their families ==
In August 2001, [[S. P. Thamilselvan]], the leader of the political wing of the Tamil Tigers, accused the Sri Lankan Army of intentionally abandoning the bodies of nearly a thousand soldiers on the battlefields since May, despite the Tamilsâ request that the Red Cross act as an intermediate.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1494082.stm]  He told visiting relatives of missing servicemen that the military had only accepted 55 bodies to return to their families, while burying the rest with full military honors on the spot. Thamilselvan did not offer a reason for the armyâs refusal, but did note that several hundred decomposing bodies remained in a minefield due to the danger of extracting them. A Sri Lankan military spokesman, Brigadier Sanath Karunaratne, acknowledged that the army cannot always retrieve a body because it might cost more lives, but denied the Tamil accusations, saying they were propaganda aimed at demoralizing the parents of the missing soldiers.

However, this was not the first time issues had arisen over reclamation of soldiersâ remains and the Armyâs responsiveness to the requests of families of missing soldiers for information regarding their fate.  In April 2003, a group of parents of some of the 619 soldiers reported missing from a battle fought 27 September 1998 obtained permission from the LTTE to travel to the battle site.  The familiesâ previous inquiries at the Defense Ministry, the Sri Lankan Army, and the International Committee of the Red Cross for information on their sonsâ fates had been fruitless.  At the battlefield they learned that some 500 bodies had been piled together, doused with [[kerosene]], and burnt on the spot by the Sri Lankan Army.  Upon their return, a lawsuit was filed on the familiesâ behalf requesting a mass funeral and [[DNA]] testing so Buddhist, Muslim and Christian families could collect their sonsâ remains and give them proper burials.  The [[Ministry of Defence (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Defence]] organized funeral in 2006, but declined to perform the requested DNA testing.[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/18/AR2006041801443.html]
