==Concept and creation==
Chris Avellone, the lead designer of ''The Sith Lords'', has said that &quot;a core part of what made KOTOR I so great was the story and your companions, and that was our intention in the sequel as well&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vault Wrap Report 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/575/575166p2.html |title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Wrap Report, Part 1 |date=23 December 2004 |work=[[RPG Vault]] |publisher=IGN |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also said that he thought that the characters and voice-acting were some of the key strengths of ''The Sith Lords'', and said that they got a lot of help and support from [[LucasArts]] in the voice-acting and sound department. Avellone stated that in some cases, the characters turned out &quot;better than we thought they would be&quot;. According to Avellone, while &quot;there was some stuff we wanted to add&quot;, overall they &quot;got almost everything we wanted in there&quot;. Avellone has said he has been surprised by the positive feedback of some of the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vault Wrap Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rpgvault.ign.com/articles/575/575798p1.html |title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Wrap Report, Part 2 |date=27 December 2004 |work=[[RPG Vault]] |publisher=IGN |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the player chooses to make Revan female, Carth and Revan may romance with each other and fall in love. Carth sometimes appears in a cut scene in the second game.

Zaalbar is a character from ''Knights of the Old Republic''. He is friends with [[#Mission Vao|Mission Vao]] and joins the player's party. Zaalbar is the brother to Chuundar, the leader of a tribe on Kashyyyk. When your party first arrives on Kashyyyk, Zaalbar is referred to as &quot;mad claw&quot;. Through Freyyr Revan learns why Zaalbar betrayed the tribe. Zaalbar learned that Chuundar was selling Wookiee slaves to Czerka Corporation, and attacked him. Freyyr sided with Chuundar and thus Zaalbar was exiled. When Revan and Freyyr confront Chuundar, Zaalbar sides with Freyyer and Revan and in turn kills Chuundar, freeing the Wookiees and driving Czerka off the planet. He has a life-debt to Revan.

====Bastila Shan====
Bastila Shan, voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]], is a [[Jedi]] who appears in the first game. The first part of the game is spent rescuing her after the Endar Spire is destroyed. She is the Jedi who defeated Revan prior to the game's beginning and joins the player's character's quest. Darth Malak captures her and seduces her to the Dark Side. If the protagonist aligns with the light side of the Force, he defeats Bastila in a lightsaber duel and she redeems herself by helping the Republic fleet. If the protagonist is a dark-side character, the player has the option of killing Bastila or allowing her to live. If the latter, Bastila becomes his apprentice. Bastila is also a romance option if your character is a light-sided male.

Bastila was chosen by IGN as their 62nd favourite ''Star Wars'' character.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Top Characters&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/star-wars-characters/ |title=Top 100 Star Wars Characters |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Juhani====
Juhani was once a [[padawan]] who believed she killed her master. She turned to the [[Dark side (Star Wars)|dark side]] and put a taint on the Grove on [[Dantooine]] where she meditated. She believed that after what she did the [[Jedi Council]] would not accept her back and that the dark side held greater power. Depending on which path the conversation is steered in by the player, Revan may either fight (and kill) her or redeem her and have her join him to discover the location of the [[Star Forge]]. She is also another possible love interest of the female Revan (light side).

Juhani was listed by [[UGO Networks]] as the 10th worst ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe character, who said that while &quot;Juhani isn't really good or bad per se. She's just utterly pointless&quot; and that &quot;she's almost a non-entity in the story. Her personality couldn't be more vanilla, her Jedi skills are inferior to others in your party... even the simple act of looking at Juhani provokes annoyance&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worst EU&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/star-wars-expanded-universe-characters-worst |title=The Worst Star Wars Expanded Universe Characters |author=Adam Rosenburg |date=6 December 2008 |work=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the main character gains experience, Jolee will tell of how he was once a [[smuggling|smuggler]], and through this met his wife. Against the wishes of the Jedi Council he trained her in the Jedi ways. She was then seduced to the dark side by Exar Kun, upon failing to convince Jolee to join [[Exar Kun]] as well, she drew her [[lightsaber]] on him. Jolee won the fight, but he was unable to bring himself to kill her. She escaped and went on to kill many Jedi. Jolee expected to be punished harshly for his mistakes, but the Council said he had learned his lessons the hard way, and even considered promoting him to knighthood. Disappointed with the Jedi's decision, Jolee left the Order and started wandering [[Star Wars galaxy|the galaxy]] before being stranded on Kashyyyk, where he meets the player character.

===''The Sith Lords'' characters===

Atton fought in the Mandalorian Wars as well as the Jedi Civil War. He originally fought with [[Galactic Republic (Star Wars)|the Republic]], and when [[Revan]] won against the [[Mandalorians]] and became Darth Revan, Atton remained under his command and became a Jedi-hunter. He can become a Jedi Sentinel during the game.

Bao-Dur is a Zabrak from [[List of Star Wars planets (H-J)#Iridonia|Iridonia]], and a technician who fought under the command of the [[Jedi Exile]] during the Mandalorian Wars. Bao-Dur is the inventor of the [[Mass Shadow Generator]] that ended the battle on [[Malachor V]] by completely obliterating the [[Mandalorian]] Armada and inadvertently killing many [[Galactic Republic|Republic]] soldiers on his own side of the battle, leading to a great deal of guilt later in his life. The Exile (who much later befriended Bao-Dur) gave the command, which sent massive echoes in the [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]] throughout the galaxy. Bao-Dur is trainable as a [[Jedi Guardian]].

====Mical====
Mical, also known as the '''Disciple''', is a character in ''The Sith Lords'', and is a soldier and force-adept that was refused for training because of the Mandalorian Wars. He eventually tells the player character that he wishes the player to be his master. He is a playable character that joins the player's party on Dantooine if your character is female. The Disciple can be influenced by light side acts and can be trained as a Jedi Consular. He eventually reveals his name as Mical to the player character.

====Mira====
Mira, voiced by [[Emily Berry]], appears in ''The Sith Lords''. Mira lost her family during the Mandalorian Wars. By the end of the wars, the [[Galactic Republic]] was flooding with refugees, and many of them, including Mira, ended up in the refugee sector of [[Nar Shaddaa]]. To survive in the hostile environment, she became a bounty hunter with the sole purpose of earning credits. A rival bounty hunter, the [[Wookiee]] [[#Hanharr|Hanharr]], was employed to hunt her by an unknown person. Mira will only join the light-sided player, and can become a [[Jedi Sentinel]].

====Hanharr====
Hanharr is a Wookiee [[bounty hunter]] in ''The Sith Lords'', and can play different roles within the game, depending on the alignment of the player character. Hanharr is encountered on the planet [[Nar Shaddaa]], as is [[Mira (Star Wars)|Mira]], another bounty hunter.

Brianna joins the party after leaving Telos on the ''Ebon Hawk'' if your character is male. Her training before joining the Exile's party makes her a skilled close quarter combatant and, after fulfilling certain combat and conversation requirements, she can be trained to become a [[Jedi Guardian]] or a Dark Jedi Guardian. It is revealed by Kreia that Brianna takes up Atris' role as the historian of the jedi.

====Visas Marr====

Visa Marr comes from the planet of Katarr, which was destroyed by Darth Nihilus when she was a child. While she is considered blind, she is able to see through the force which allowed her to find the jedi exile. When she confronts the Exile, she loses and in turn becomes part of the Exile's party. When the Exile confronted Darth Nihilus, they with Mandalore, were able to defeat Nihilus. What happened to her after that is unknown. If she went with the Exile to fight the sith empire or stayed behind is a mystery.

====G0-T0====
G0-T0 is a [[droid (robot)|droid]] who appears in ''The Sith Lords''. Built to oversee and aid in the planetary reconstruction of the planet [[Telos (Star Wars)|Telos]], its programming included two directives: produce options to rebuild the Republic and follow all the laws of the Republic. Sadly, all options G0-T0 could think of to assist the Republic would involve breaking a Republic law. Following this, the droid 'broke'; it overrided the second directive, and set up the greatest smuggling organisation in the galaxy. Eventually the droid would be destroyed, but not before the organisation had helped countless systems achieve prosperity.

Malak and Revan disobeyed the Jedi Council and helped the Republic defend against the Mandalorians. They fell to the dark side in pursuing the Mandalorians. Malak then betrays his master and usurps the title of Dark Lord of the Sith. However, Revan survives the attack, at the cost of his memory. Revan regains his power in the search for the Star Forge, and defeats Malak in the game's final battle.

Jesse Schedeen of IGN put Malak, along with Revan, as their fifth favourite ''Star Wars'' villain, saying that &quot;[v]isually, both Jedi are immediately memorable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Villains III&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/867/867311p1.html |title=Top 15 Star Wars Villains: Episode III |author=Jesse Schedeen |date=17 April 2008 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN also put Malak as their 28th top ''Star Wars'' character&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Top Characters&quot;/&gt; and their 33rd favourite videogame villain.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN VG Villains&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/videogame-villains/33.html |title=Top 100 Videogame Villains |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GamePro|GamePro's]] Hugh Sterbakov listed Darth Malak as 22nd most diabolical videogame villain of all time, saying he was &quot;one of, if not the coolest expanded universe Star Wars character yet&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Diabolical&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/166648/the-47-most-diabolical-video-game-villains-of-all-time-page-4-of-7 |title=The 47 Most Diabolical Video-Game Villains of All Time |author=Hugh Sterbakov |date=5 March 2008 |work=GamePro |accessdate=12 May 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101018151519/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/166648/the-47-most-diabolical-video-game-villains-of-all-time-page-4-of-7|archivedate=2010-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; UGO Networks put the character as their 19th top ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe character.&lt;ref name=&quot;UGO EU&quot;/&gt; On [[GameSpot]]'s &quot;All-Time Greatest Villain&quot; competition, Darth Malak managed to get into the top sixteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;GS All-Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/greatest-video-game-villain/standings/index.html?tag=content_nav%3Bsubnav%3Bresults |title=All-Time Greatest Villains |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameDaily's Robert Workman put Darth Malak as their 16th top evil mastermind of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;GD Masterminds&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-evil-masterminds-of-all-time/?page=16&amp;cp=5 |title=Top 25 Evil Masterminds of All Time |author=Robert Workman |date=26 November 2008 |work=[[GameDaily]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Workman also listed Malak as one of his favourite ''Star Wars'' video game characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;SWVG&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20081015105415/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/our-favorite-characters-from-star-wars-video-games/?page=6 |title=Our Favorite Characters From Star Wars Video Games |author=Robert Workman |date=11 September 2008 |work=GameDaily |archiveurl=http://replay.web.archive.org/20081015105415/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/our-favorite-characters-from-star-wars-video-games/?page=6 |archivedate=15 October 2008 |accessdate=10 Mary 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kreia===
Kreia acts as the teacher and mentor to the Jedi Exile in ''The Sith Lords''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meet Your Team&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gsinterview2&quot;&gt;{{cite video |date=8 May 2004 |title=Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Developer Interview 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/video/920194/6096604/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords-developer-interview-2 |publisher=[[Gamespot]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is revealed to have been Darth Traya, a Sith Lord, at the end of the game.

Kreia was chosen by IGN as the 81st top ''Star Wars'' character&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Top Characters&quot;/&gt; and Kreia, along with the other Sith Lords, was put as the 2nd top ''Star Wars'' villain that was left out of the original list by Jesse Scheedeen based on reader's comments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fan Villains&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/869/869530p4.html |title=Top Star Wars Villains: Fan Favorites |author=Jesse Schedeen |date=25 April 2008 |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IGN's Hilary Goldstein said that said that &quot;Kreia offers some truly fantastic dialogue in KOTOR 2&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meet Your Team&quot;/&gt; GameSpy praised Kreia as &quot;Best Character&quot; in their &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards for 2005, saying that &quot;Kreia was easily the most intriguing, complicated, enigmatic, well-designed and nuanced character in a video game [in 2005]&quot; and that she made &quot;a trip full of heavy-duty thought a whole lot of fun&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GotY&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goty.gamespy.com/2005/pc/index23.html |title=GameSpy's Game of the Year 2005 |work=[[GameSpy]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negatively, UGO Networks' Adam Rosenburg put Kreia as the 6th worst Expanded Universe character, commenting that her redemption at the end of the game was stupid and that the name &quot;Darth Traya&quot; was &quot;stupidly lame&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worst EU&quot;/&gt;

===Darth Sion===
Darth Sion, voiced by [[Louis Mellis]], is an antagonist in ''The Sith Lords''. Darth Traya trained both Sion and Nihilus, who in turn betray her. He holds his ravaged body together with the dark-side of the Force. The player's character eventually defeats Sion.

===Darth Nihilus===
Darth Nihilus appears in ''The Sith Lords'' and in the ''[[Star Wars: Legacy]]'' comic series. Darth Traya found and trained Nihilus; Nihilus and Darth Sion later betrayed her. The player's character eventually defeats Nihilus.

Nihilus, along with the other Sith Lords, was put as the 2nd top ''Star Wars'' villain who didn't appear in an earlier list based on reader's comments by IGN's Jesse Schedeen, Schedeen commenting &quot;[a]t the very least, Nihilus probably wins the award for coolest-looking ''Star Wars'' villain ever&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fan Villains&quot;/&gt; [[IGN]] also put the character as their 56th top ''Star Wars'' character.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN Top Characters&quot;/&gt;

If Revan spares Freyrr, he kills Chuundar and the slavers, frees the Wookiees, frees Zaalbar, and leaves with the gratitude of Freyrr, able to return to Kashyyyk at any time.
*'''Ada''' is an abused cantina waitress from Taris whom Revan rescues from enslavement. In cut content, she was to appear on Dantooine and later Manaan, where she would help Revan in a few side-quests. She appeared in the first game.
