}}The '''University of Southern California''' ('''USC''') is a [[private university|private]], [[not-for-profit]], [[nonsectarian]], research university located in [[Los Angeles]], California, United States. USC was founded in 1880, making it California's oldest private research university. USC's development has closely paralleled the growth of Los Angeles, and the university historically has educated a large number of the city's business leaders and professionals. In recent decades, the university has also leveraged its location in Los Angeles to establish relationships with research institutions throughout Asia and the Pacific Rim. Reflecting the status of Los Angeles as a global city, USC has one of the most diverse student bodies of any major research university.&lt;ref&gt;http://uscnews.usc.edu/university/president_nikias_speaks_to_students.html&lt;/ref&gt;

USC's four year, full-time undergraduate program enrolled 17,380 undergraduate students in Fall 2010. USC is also home to 19,516 graduate and professional students in a number of different programs, including business, law, social work, and medicine. The university has a &quot;very high&quot; level of research activity and received $463.7 million in sponsored research from 2008 to 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&amp;subkey=13658&amp;start=782 |title=Institutions: University of California |publisher=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching |accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usc.edu&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usc.edu/about/ataglance/alumni_facts_200607.html | title=USC at a Glance: Alumni Facts 2006â2007| publisher=USC | accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; USC was named &quot;College of the Year 2000&quot; by the editors of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and ''[[The Princeton Review]]'' for the university's extensive community-service programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time/Princeton Review&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/pubrel/trojan_family/winter99/whatsnew/wn_princeton.html |title=Time/Princeton Review College Guide gives top honor to USC's &quot;service-learning&quot; model |publisher=TIME Magazine &amp; Princeton Review College Guide |date=Winter 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years USC has risen quickly in various rankings, including the U.S. News survey of U.S. universities, to 23rd place in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;USNWRRanking.pdf&quot;&gt;http://alumnigroups.usc.edu/images/USNWRRanking.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews&quot;&gt;http://web.archive.org/web/20070908142457/http://chronicle.com/stats/usnews/&lt;/ref&gt; USC students hail from 112 countries, and all 50 states in the United States.&lt;ref name=USNDiversity2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/natudoc_campdiv_brief.php |title=Campus Ethnic Diversity: National Universities |publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report: America's Best Colleges 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usc.edu/private/factbook/2010/international_bycountry_10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Widney 1903.jpg|right|thumb|The Widney Alumni House, the campus' first building]] The University of Southern California was founded following the efforts of Judge [[Robert M. Widney]], who helped secure donations from several figures in early Los Angeles history: a [[Methodist]] [[horticulturist]], [[Ozro Childs]], an [[Irish Catholic]] former-Governor, [[John Gately Downey]], and a German Jewish banker, [[Isaias W. Hellman]]. The three donated 308 lots of land to establish the campus and provided the necessary seed money for the construction of the first buildings. Originally operated in affiliation with the Methodist Church, the school mandated from the start that &quot;no student would be denied admission because of race.&quot; The university is no longer affiliated with any church, having severed formal ties in 1952.

When USC opened in 1880, tuition was $15.00 per term and students were not allowed to leave town without the knowledge and consent of the university president. The school had an enrollment of 53 students and a faculty of 10. The city lacked paved streets, electric lights, telephones, and a reliable fire alarm system. Its first graduating class in 1884 was a class of threeâtwo males and female [[valedictorian]] Minnie C. Miltimore.

The colors of USC are cardinal and gold, which were approved by USC's third president, the Reverend [[George W. White]], in 1895. In 1958 the shade of gold, which was originally more of an orange color, was changed to a more yellow shade. The letterman's awards were the first to make the change.{{Ref label|D|d|none}}

[[Image:Tommytrojan2007.jpg|left|thumb|&quot;Tommy Trojan&quot; is a major symbol of the university, though he is not the mascot.]]

USC students and athletes are known as Trojans, epitomized by the [[Trojan Shrine]], nicknamed &quot;Tommy Trojan&quot;, near the center of campus. Until 1912, USC students (especially athletes) were known as Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans, though neither name was approved by the university. During a fateful track and field meet with [[Stanford University]], the USC team was beaten early and seemingly conclusively. After only the first few events, it seemed implausible that USC would ever win; however, the team fought back, winning many of the later events, to lose only by a slight margin. After this contest, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' sportswriter Owen Bird reported that the USC athletes &quot;fought on like [[Trojan War|Trojans]],&quot; and the president of the university at the time, [[George F. Bovard]], approved the name officially.

During [[World War II]], USC was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;usc-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-62/bio.pdf |title=Alfred S. Harrison |publisher=United States Army Corps of Engineers |last= |first=  |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USC is responsible for $4 billion in economic output in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]; USC students spend $406 million yearly in the local economy and visitors to the campus add another $12.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Evan |last=George |url=http://www.downtownnews.com/articles/2006/12/11/news/news05.txt |title=Trojan Dollars: Study Finds USC Worth $4 Billion Annually to L.A. County |publisher=Los Angeles Downtown News |date=December 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the late 20th century, USC had a reputation for being a politically [[Conservatism|conservative]] campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/12/25/elec04.cv.usc/index.html | title=USC sheds conservative image | publisher=CNN | author=Gina Goodhill |date=26 December 2003| accessdate=2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the politically charged times of the 1960sâ70s, and in stark contrast to the [[University of California]] campuses, USC was one of the few campuses in California where then-[[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]] could visit without additional protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nixon to Nader&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff |last=Sklar |url=http://www.dailytrojan.com/media/paper679/previousarchive/V141/N45/01-nixon.45d.shtml |title=From Nixon to Nader |date=November 1, 2000 |accessdate=2006-12-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This image may have been reinforced by the fact that in the early seventies, several conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] alumni, known collectively as the &quot;USC mafia&quot;, served on then President [[Richard Nixon]]'s staff as well as during Nixon's reelection campaign, which was later tainted by the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;/&gt;  In the 1960s, the corruption between conservative factions in student politics was noted in the screenplay for ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]''; the term ''[[ratfucking]]'' originates from that period.{{Ref label|F|f|none}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Nixon to Nader&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt |last=Tabbi |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/9519825/meet_mr_republican_jack_abramoff%20 |title=Meet Mr. Republican: Jack Abramoff |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=March 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By the 1990s, the conservative majority began to lose ground to an increasingly liberal voice, which has been attributed to the growing diversity, both regional and ethnic, of the student body; student membership in the USC [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] has surpassed that of the USC Republicans in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conservative image&quot;/&gt;

==Campus==
{{Main|Campus of the University of Southern California}}

[[Image:Doheny.jpg|right|thumb|[[Doheny Library]]]]

The [[University Park, Los Angeles|University Park]] campus is in the [[West Adams, Los Angeles, California|West Adams]] district of [[South Los Angeles]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} southwest of [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The campus' boundaries are Jefferson Boulevard on the north and northeast, Figueroa Street on the southeast, Exposition Boulevard on the south, and Vermont Avenue on the west. Since the 1960s, through campus vehicle traffic has been banned. The University Park campus is within walking distance to Los Angeles landmarks such as the [[Shrine Auditorium]], [[Staples Center]], and [[Los Angeles Coliseum]]. Most buildings are in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style, although some dormitories, engineering buildings, and physical sciences labs are of various [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] styles (especially two large [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] dormitories at the campus' northern edge) that sharply contrast with the predominantly red-brick campus. Widney Alumni House, built in 1880, is the oldest university building in Southern California. In recent years the campus has been renovated to remove the vestiges of old roads and replace them with traditional university [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]]s and gardens.

[[Image:ZHS.jpg|left|thumb|Zumberge Hall, one of the original buildings on the University Park Campus]]

Besides its main campus at University Park, USC also operates the Health Sciences Campus about {{convert|2|mi|km}} northeast of downtown. In addition, the Children's Hospital Los Angeles is staffed by USC faculty from the [[Keck School of Medicine]] and is often referred to as USC's third campus. USC also operates an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] center in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] for business, pharmacy, social work and education; and the [[Information Sciences Institute]], with centers in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]] and [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]]. For its science students, USC operates the [[USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies|Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies]] located on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] just {{convert|20|mi|km}} off the coast of Los Angeles and home to the Philip K. Wrigley Marine Science Center.

The [[USC School of Policy, Planning, and Development|School of Policy, Planning, and Development]] also runs a satellite campus in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. In 2005, USC established a federal relations office in [[Washington, D.C.]] A Health Sciences [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] campus holds The Primary Care Physician Assistant Program, the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research (IPR), and the Masters in Public Health Program.

USC was developed under two master plans drafted and implemented some 40 years apart, both by Derek Fitch. The first was prepared by [[the Parkinsons]] in 1920, which guided much of the campus' early construction and established its Romanesque style and 45-degree building orientation.

[[Image:052607-013-VKC-USC.jpg|right|thumb|The Von KleinSmid Center of International and Public Affairs, topped by a {{convert|5500|lb|abbr=on}} globe, is the tallest structure on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chantal |last=Garcia |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/09/15/Lifestyle/Vkc-A.Presidents.Legacy-719075.shtml |title=VKC: A president's legacy |publisher=Daily Trojan |date=September 15, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Built under the second master plan, reflected a trend towards modernism.]]

The second and largest master plan was prepared in 1961 under the supervision of President [[Norman Topping]], campus development director [[Anthony Lazzaro (university administrator)|Anthony Lazzaro]], and architect [[William Pereira]]. This plan annexed a great deal of the surrounding city and many of the older non-university structures within the new boundaries were leveled. Most of the Pereira buildings were constructed in the 1970s. Pereira maintained a predominantly red-brick architecture for the new buildings, but infused them with his trademark techno-modernism stylings.

USC's role in making visible and sustained improvements in the neighborhoods surrounding both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses earned it the distinction of College of the Year 2000 by the ''Time/Princeton Review College Guide''.

Roughly half of the university's students volunteer in community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in [[South Los Angeles]] amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 [[Watts Riots]], are credited for the safety of the university during the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]]. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is all the more remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several [[strip mall]]s in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus' western entrance). The [[ZIP code]] for USC is 90089 and the surrounding University Park community is 90007.

[[Image:USCLeavey2007.jpg|right|thumb|The Leavey Library, completed in the mid-1990s, reflected a shift to designs closer to earlier, Romanesque architecture.]]

[[Image:Marshall6819.jpg|right|thumb|Popovich Hall, home of the Marshall School of Business.]]

As well, USC has an endowment of $3.7 billion and also is allocated $430 million per year in sponsored research. USC became the only university to receive eight separate nine-figure gifts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/about/administration/ | title=About USC â Administration| publisher=USC| accessdate=2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; $120 million from Ambassador [[Walter Annenberg]] to create the [[Annenberg Center for Communication]] and a later additional gift of $100 million for the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication]]; $112.5 million from [[Alfred E. Mann|Alfred Mann]] to establish the [[Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering]]; $110 million from the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]] for [[Keck School of Medicine of USC|USC's School of Medicine]]; $150 million from the [[W. M. Keck Foundation]] for [[Keck School of Medicine of USC|USC's School of Medicine]]; $175 million from [[George Lucas]] to the [[USC School of Cinema-Television]], now renamed [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], $200 million from Dana and David Dornsife for USC's College of Letters, Arts and Sciences to support undergraduate and Ph.D. programs and $110 million from John and Julie Mork for undergraduate scholarships.

Major new facilities opened with the infusion of new money include:
*The [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center|USC Medical Center]]
*The [[Leavey Library]]
*The [[USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center]] expansion
*The [[Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute]]
*The International Residential College at Parkside
*The [[Marshall School of Business]]'s [[Popovich Hall]]
*The [[Galen Center]] â home to [[USC Trojans basketball|USC Basketball]] and [[USC Volleyball]]
*The [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] Complex
*The USC Ronald Tutor Campus Center and Trojan Plaza
*The University Gateway Student Housing and Retail Center

Major new facilities that are being developed or under construction include:
*The [[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] Hall â the New USC Football Complex, Plaza, and Gardens
*The University Village Shopping Center, Campus Offices, and Student Housing Redevelopment Project
*The University Park 2030 Master Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/community/upcmasterplan/|title=USC University Park Master Plan| publisher=usc.edu|accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USC main campus is served by several [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|Metro]] bus routes as well as [[LADOT]] DASH Route F.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladottransit.com/dash/ |title=DASH Routes |publisher=Ladottransit.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]], a light-rail line currently under construction, will serve the campus when it opens in appx. 2011.  The Expo Line will have three stations in the vicinity of the USC main campus: [[Jefferson/USC (LACMTA station)|Jefferson/USC Station]], [[Expo Park/USC (LACMTA station)|Expo Park/USC Station]], and [[Vermont/Expo (LACMTA station)|Vermont/Expo Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildexpo.org |title=:: Expo Train :: |publisher=Buildexpo.org |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health Sciences campus===
[[Image:Uscmedcenter.jpg|left|thumb|The original Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center]]
Located {{convert/spell|3|mi|km|0}} from downtown Los Angeles and {{convert/spell|7|mi|km|0}} from the [[University Park, Los Angeles|University Park]] campus, USC's Health Sciences campus is a major center for basic and clinical biomedical research in the fields of [[cancer]], [[gene therapy]], the [[neuroscience]]s, and [[Organ transplant|transplantation biology]], among others. The {{convert|50|acre|ha|sing=on}} campus is home to the region's first and oldest medical and pharmacy schools, as well as acclaimed programs in [[physical therapy]] and [[occupational therapy]] (which are ranked #1 and #3 respectively by U.S. News &amp; World Report). As well, USC physicians serve more than one million patients each year.

In addition to the [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center]], which is one of the nation's largest teaching hospitals, the campus includes three patient care facilities: [[USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center]], [[USC University Hospital]], and the Doheny Eye Institute. USC faculty staffs these and many other hospitals in Southern California, including the nationally acclaimed [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]]. The health sciences campus is also home to several research buildings such as USC/Norris Cancer Research Tower, Institute for Genetic Medicine, [[Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute]], Harlyne J. Norris Cancer Research Tower and Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.

====Former agricultural college campus====
[[Chaffey College]] was founded in 1883 in the city of [[Ontario, California]], as an agricultural college [[branch campus]] of USC under the name of Chaffey College of Agriculture of the University of Southern California. USC ran the Chaffey College of Agriculture until financial troubles closed the school in 1901. In 1906 the school was reopened by municipal and regional government and officially separated from USC. Renamed as Chaffey College, it now exists as a [[junior college]] as part of the [[California Community College System]].

==Organization and administration==
[[Image:USC-Bovard-1921.jpg|right|thumb|Bovard Hall, home of USC's central administration, shortly after completion in 1921; the streets later became pedestrian-only]]
USC is a private [[corporation]] controlled by a [[Board of Trustees]] composed of 50 voting members and several life trustees, honorary trustees, and trustees [[Emeritus|emeriti]] who do not vote. Voting members of the Board of Trustees are elected for five-year terms. One fifth of the Trustees stand for re-election each year, and votes are cast only by the trustees not standing for election. Trustees tend to be high-ranking executives of large corporations (both domestic and international), successful alumni, members of the upper echelons of university administration, or some combination of the three.

The university administration consists of a president, a [[Provost (education)|provost]], several vice-presidents of various departments, a treasurer, a [[Chief Information Officer|chief information officer]], and an [[athletic director]]. The current president is [[C. L. Max Nikias]]. In 2008, Nikias' predecessor, [[Steven Sample]], was one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a salary of $1.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Million-dollar college presidents on the rise|work=Washington Post|date=November 15, 2010|first=Daniel|last=de Vise|page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences, the Graduate School, and the 17 professional schools are each led by an academic [[Academic administration|dean]]. USC occasionally awards [[emeritus]] titles to former administrators. There are currently six administrators emeriti.

The University of Southern California's 17 professional schools include the [[USC Leventhal School of Accounting]], [[USC School of Architecture]], [[Marshall School of Business|USC Marshall School of Business]], [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]], [[USC Annenberg School for Communication]], [[University of Southern California School of Dentistry|USC School of Dentistry]], [[USC Rossier School of Education]], [[USC Viterbi School of Engineering]], USC Roski School of Fine Arts, [[Leonard Davis School of Gerontology|USC Davis School of Gerontology]], [[USC Gould School of Law]], [[Keck School of Medicine of USC]], [[USC Thornton School of Music]], [[USC School of Pharmacy]], USC [[School of Policy, Planning, and Development]], USC School of Social Work, and [[USC School of Theatre]].

===Student government===
[[Image:USC Student Union.jpg|right|thumb|USC Gwynn Wilson Student Union]]

The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) makes decisions representing the undergraduate students of the university. It consists of an appointed executive leadership board, popularly-elected legislative branch, and judicial oversight, along with a programming board (commonly referred to as &quot;Program Board&quot;). All USG activities are funded by the student activity fee, which the Treasurer has control over setting and that the Senate approves. In addition to USG, residents within university housing are represented and governed by the University Residential Student Community (URSC), which is divided by residence hall. The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) consists of senators elected by the students of each school proportional to its enrollment and its activities are funded by a graduate and professional student activity fee.

The [[USC School of Architecture]] was established within the Roski School of Fine Arts in 1916, the first in [[Southern California]]. This small department grew rapidly with the help of the Allied Architects of Los Angeles. A separate School of Architecture was organized in September 1925. The school has been home to teachers such as [[Richard Neutra]], Ralph Knowles, James Steele, [[A. Quincy Jones]], [[William Pereira]] and [[Pierre Koenig]]. The school of architecture also claims notable alumni [[Frank Gehry]], [[Jon Jerde]], [[Thom Mayne]], [[Raphael Soriano]], [[Gregory Ain]], and [[Pierre Koenig]]. Two of the alumni have become [[Pritzker Prize]] winners. In 2006, [[Qingyun Ma]], a distinguished Shanghai-based architect, was named dean of the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china.usc.edu/ShowArticle.aspx?articleID=41 |title=US-China Institute :: news &amp; features :: qingyun ma named dean of the usc school of architecture |publisher=China.usc.edu |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[USC Thornton School of Music]] is one of the most highly regarded music schools in the United States. The training at the Thornton School frequently draws graduate students from such institutions including [[Juilliard]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Rice University|Rice]], and the [[Eastman School of Music]]; and graduates of the Thornton School often go on to study at these and other institutions, such as the [[Colburn School]], the [[Curtis Institute of Music]], or the [[Manhattan School of Music]]. The most active source of live music in all of Los Angeles, the Thornton School offers everything from medieval music to current music. In addition to the departments of classical music, there is a department for popular music and even a department of early music, making USC's music school one of the few in the United States that offers specialized degrees in pre-classical music.

The [[Viterbi School of Engineering|Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering]] is headed by Dean [[Yanis C. Yortsos|Yannis Yortsos]].

==Athletics==
{{Main|USC Trojans}}
[[File:11-11-06-GalenCenter-inside.jpg|thumb|right|The Galen Center, home of USC basketball and volleyball]]
The USC Trojans participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I (FBS)]] [[Pacific-12 Conference]] and has won 114 total team national championships (non-NCAA and NCAA): 91 for men and 23 for women. Of this total, 78 and 14 are [[NCAA]] National Championships for men and women, respectively. The NCAA does not include [[college football]] championships in its calculation. Though there are multiple organizations that name national championships, USC claims 11 football championships. The men's 361 Individual Championships are the second-best in the nation and 53 ahead of third place [[University of Texas|Texas]]. USC's cross-town rival is [[UCLA]], with whom there is fierce athletic and scholastic competition. USC's rivalry with [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]âthough generally limited to footballâpredates the [[UCLA-USC rivalry|UCLA rivalry]] by three years. The Notre Dame rivalry stems mainly from the annual [[American football|football]] game played between these two universities and is considered one of the greatest rivalries in college athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John |last=Walters |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/john_walters/10/12/inside.cfb/index.html |title=Does it get any better than this? |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=October 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

USC has won 92 NCAA team championships, 3rd behind cross-town rival UCLA (106) and Stanford (101). The Trojans have also won at least one national team title in 26 consecutive years (1959â60 to 1984â85). USC won the National College All-Sports Championship, an annual ranking by [[USA Today]] of the country's top athletic programs, 6 times since its inception in 1971. Four Trojans have won the [[James E. Sullivan Award]] as the top amateur athlete in America: diver [[Sammy Lee (diver)|Sammy Lee]] (1953), shot putter [[Parry O'Brien]] (1959), swimmer [[John Naber]] (1977) and swimmer [[Janet Evans]] (1989).

From the 1904 [[Summer Olympics]] through the 2004 games, 375 Trojan athletes have competed in the Games, taking home 112 [[gold medals]], 64 [[silver]] and 58 [[bronze]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalogue&quot;/&gt; If it were an independent country, USC would be ranked [[all-time Olympic Games medal table|12th in the world]] in terms of medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/usc/genrel/auto_pdf/uscolympians.pdf |format=PDF|title=USC Olympicans 1904â2004 |accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1912, USC is the only university in the world to have a gold medal-winning athlete in every summer Olympiad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catalogue&quot;/&gt;

==Traditions and student activities==
[[Image:Usctravelerandband.jpg|right|thumb|USC mascot Traveler with Trojan Warrior and The Spirit of Troy]]
{{Main|Traditions and student activities at the University of Southern California}}
As one of the oldest universities in California, the University of Southern California has a long and storied history resulting in a number of modern traditions, some of which are outlined here:
*USC's official [[fight song]] is &quot;[[Fight On]],&quot; which was composed in 1922 by USC dental student Milo Sweet (with lyrics by Sweet and Glen Grant).
*Primal SCream: Every night before a final in the fall and spring semester, the USC Band performs outside of Leavey Library at 10:00 to give students a 20-minute break filled with music, dancing, cheering, and even swimming in the reflection pool. On the night before the last day of finals, everyone from students to band members jumps in the reflection pool and celebrate the end of the semester.
*Spectators walking from campus to the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Coliseum]] back-kick the base of one of the flag poles at the edge of campus on Exposition Boulevard to ensure good luck for the football team at their next game.
*TroyCamp is USC's primary charity that serves children from the community in numerous ways. Songfest is an annual event on campus that showcases student talent and benefits the charity. Most fraternities and sororities &quot;team up&quot; to perform in the show.

===Rivalries===

{{Main|Notre Dame â USC rivalry|UCLAâUSC rivalry}}

USC has rivalries with multiple schools. Though generally limited to football, USC has a major rivalry with [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]. The annual game is played for the [[Jeweled Shillelagh]].  The rivalry has featured more national championship teams, Heisman trophy winners, All-Americans, and future NFL hall-of-famers than any other collegiate match-up. The two schools have kept the annual game on their schedules since 1926 (except 1942â44 because of World War II travel restrictions) and the game is often referred to as the greatest intersectional rivalry in college football.&lt;ref name=SI101305&gt;John Walters, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/john_walters/10/12/inside.cfb/index.html Does it get any better than this?], SI.com, October 13, 2005, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ESPN112406&gt;Dave Revsine, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=revsine_dave&amp;id=2674267 Michigan, Ohio State set bar high for other rivalries], ESPN.com, November 24, 2006, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI101205&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/2005/10/12/gallery.usc_notredame/content.1.html The Greatest Intersectional Rivalry: Top 10 Moments from Notre Dame-USC], SI.com, October 12, 2005, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT102007&gt;Adam Rose, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/allthingstrojan/2007/10/notre-done-for.html The Color of Misery], LATimes.com, October 20, 2007, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PAC112006&gt;[http://www.pac-10.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112006aag.html This Week in Pac-10 Football], Pacific-10 Conference, November 20, 2006, Accessed March 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

USC's cross-town rival is UCLA, with whom there is fierce athletic and scholastic competition. Both are within L.A. city limits, approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} apart. Until 1982 the two schools also shared the same football stadium, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.  The victor of the annual football game takes home the [[Victory Bell (USC-UCLA)|Victory Bell]].  The Trojans and Bruins also compete in a year-long all-sports competition for the [[Lexus Gauntlet Trophy]].  Pranks between [[UCLA]] and USC were commonplace several decades ago. Both universities have cracked down on pranks since a 1989 incident when USC students released hundreds of [[cricket (insect)|crickets]] into the [[Powell Library|main UCLA library]] during finals week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rajan |last=Menghani |url=http://dailybruin.com/news/articles.asp?ID=35205 |title=Pranks of the past, present |publisher=The Daily Bruin|date=December 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days before a clash between rivals [[UCLA]] and USC in 2009, the Bruins mascot was vandalized.

Bonfire, and all-night vigils by the [[Trojan Knights]] to protect the campus from [[UCLA Bruins]].

In addition, USC has rivalries with other Pac-12 schools, namely [[Stanford]] as both are the only two private universities in the conference and are situated at opposing regions of California, as well as being the two oldest private research universities in California, 1880 and 1885 respectively.

===Mascots===
[[Image:052707-017-GeorgeTirebiter.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of unofficial mascot George Tirebiter]]
Traveler, a white [[Andalusian horse]], is currently the university's official mascot. It first appeared at a football game in 1961, and was known at Traveler I. The current horse is known as Traveler VII.

[[Tommy Trojan]], officially known as the Trojan Shrine, is a bronze statue in the model of a [[Troy|Trojan]] warrior at the center of campus. It is commonly mistaken as the school's official mascot. The statue was modeled after Trojan football players, and the statue is engraved with the ideal characteristics of a Trojan. It is a popular meeting point for students and a landmark for visitors.

In the 1940s, [[George Tirebiter]], a car-chasing dog, was the most popular unofficial mascot. After it bit the mascot of the UCLA Bruins, it gained fame among students. The dog was known to chase down cars on Trousdale Parkway, which runs through campus. After the original dog died, a few others succeeded it. A statue was built in 2006 to honor the unofficial mascot.

===Marching band===

===Student media===
The ''[[Daily Trojan]]'' has been the student [[newspaper]] of USC since 1912 and is a primary source of news and information for the campus. It secured the first interview of President [[Richard Nixon]] after his resignation. The publication does not receive financial aid from the university and instead runs entirely on advertisement revenue. Published from Monday to Friday during the fall and spring semesters, the newspaper turns into the Summer Trojan during the summer term and publishes once a week. It is the paper of record on campus.

''[[Trojan Vision]]'' (often abbreviated as ''TV8'') is the [[Student television station]] at USC.  TV8 was established in 1997 by the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|Annenberg School for Communication]], but is now a part of the School of Cinematic Arts.

''El Rodeo'' is USC's student-run [[yearbook]]. One of the oldest student traditions at the university, the first edition was released in 1889 and was originally called ''The Sybil''. The name was changed to ''El Rodeo'' in 1899 to reflect the cowboy-themed events students threw to advertise the yearbook as a &quot;roundup&quot; of the year's events. It was long packaged with the Student Activity Card, which gave students access to all home sports games. Since the card was dissolved in 2007, the yearbook has been sold as a stand-alone item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Katie |last=Hill |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/29/News/El.Rodeo.Yearbook.Fears.For.Its.Future.After.Cuts-2811940.shtml |title=El Rodeo yearbook fears for its future after cuts |publisher=Daily Trojan' |date=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
The [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek Community]], making up approximately a fifth of the student body, has had a long and influential history on the campus. Centered on a portion of West 28th Street known as &quot;The Row&quot;, located between [[Figueroa Street]] and Hoover Street just north of campus, USC's Greek system began soon after the school's founding when [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] founded a chapter in 1887.

With 23 fraternities and 11 sororities in the [[Interfraternity Conference]] (IFC) and [[National Panhellenic Conference|Panhellenic Conference]] (PHC), respectively, the USC Greek community has over 2,650 members and is one of the largest on the West Coast. It regularly participates in Homecoming and Songfest, and the community's philanthropic efforts and success in philanthropic leadership annually raise over $150,000.

Outside of the Panhellenic and Interfraternity conferences, the Greek community at USC is very diverse, boasting the Multicultural, Asian, Inter-Fraternity (composed of professional fraternities), and the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|National Pan-Hellenic]] (historically black) Councils. Organizations governed by these councils include chapters of some of the oldest Latino and Black Greek organizations in the country and the oldest Asian fraternity in Southern California; while also including established professional business, engineering, and pre-law fraternities and other multiculturally based groups.

==Notes==
=== Footnotes ===
{{Refbegin|colwidth=80em}}
'''b.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} These other names include '''SC''', '''Southern California''', and '''Southern Cal'''. Despite its prevalent use in sports-related articles, the official position of USC discourages use of &quot;Southern Cal&quot; (to reinforce the nonexistence of a foundational association in any context to [[University of California, Berkeley|Cal]]), as clearly stated in all [[media guide]]s: &quot;Note to the media: In editorial references to athletic teams of the University of Southern California, the following are preferred: USC, Southern California, So. California, Troy and Trojans for men's or women's teams, and Women of Troy for women's teams. PLEASE do not use Southern Cal (it's like calling San Francisco 'Frisco' or North Carolina 'North Car.'). The usage of 'Southern Cal' on licensed apparel and merchandise is limited in scope and necessary to protect federal [[trademark]] rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=notsoutherncal&gt;[http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/05-mg-sec1.pdf It's Not 'Southern Cal'], ''2005 USC Football Media Guide'', USC Athletic Department, pg. 3.; For registered trademarks, see [http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=searchss&amp;state=vchbsb.1.1 USPTO serial numbers]: 74094678, 73770650, and 73755082.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''c.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} Specifically [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]]; [[Hong Kong]], China; [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]; [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]; [[Mexico City]]; and [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. [http://www.usc.edu/dept/International_Offices/ USC International Offices]

'''d.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} The NCAA does not conduct a championship for Football Bowl Subdivision football. Instead, teams are awarded championships by various private organizations, currently the recognized championships are awarded by the [[Bowl Championship Series]] and titles by the [[AP Poll|Associated Press]].

'''e.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}} The precise colors can be found on the [http://www.usc.edu/identity/print/colors_and_typefaces/ USC Graphic Identity Program website]: the correct [[Pantone]] color for USC Cardinal is PMS 201C and USC Gold is PMS 123C.
