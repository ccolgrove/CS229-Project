The term ''Peleset'' ([[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliterated]] from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] as ''P-r-s-t'') is found in numerous Egyptian documents referring to a neighboring people or land starting from c.1150 BCE during the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt]]. The first mention is thought to be in texts of the temple at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]] which record a people called the Peleset among the [[Sea Peoples]] who invaded [[Egypt]] in [[Ramesses III]]'s reign.&lt;ref name=Fahlbuschp185/&gt; The [[Assyria]]ns called the same region ''Palashtu'' or ''Pilistu'', beginning with [[Adad-nirari III]] in the Nimrud Slab in c.800 BCE through to emperor [[Sargon II]] in his Annals approximately a century later.&lt;ref name=Sharonp4&gt;Sharon, 1988, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roomp285/&gt;&lt;ref name=ehrlich&gt;Carl S.

Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the Egyptian or Assyrian sources provided clear regional boundaries for the term.

The first clear use of the term Palestine to refer to the region synonymous with that defined in modern times was in 5th century BC [[Ancient Greece]]. [[Herodotus]] wrote of a 'district of Syria, called ''PalaistinÃª''&quot; in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', the first historical work clearly defining the region, which included the [[Judean mountains]] and the [[Jordan Rift Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, David M., ''Palestine and Israel'', Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 313 (Feb., 1999), pp. 65â74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Southern and Eastern Borders of Abar-Nahara Steven S. Tuell Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 284 (Nov., 1991), pp. 51â57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus' Description of the East Mediterranean Coast Anson F. Rainey Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 321 (Feb., 2001), pp. 57â63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his work, Herodotus referred to the practice of [[History of male circumcision|male circumcision]] associated with the Hebrew people: &quot;the [[Colchis|Colchians]], the [[Egyptians]], and the [[Ethiopians]], are the only nations who have practised circumcision from the earliest times. The [[Phoenicians]] and the Syrians of Palestine themselves confess that they learnt the custom of the Egyptians.... Now these are the only nations who use circumcision.&quot; [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.mb.txt The History of Herodotus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beloe, W., Rev., ''Herodotus'', (tr. from Greek), with notes, Vol.II, London, 1821, p.269 &quot;It should be remembered that Syria is always regarded by Herodotus as synonymous with [[Assyria]]. What the Greeks called Palestine the Arabs call Falastin, which is the Philistines of Scripture.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.losttrails.com/herald/messages/33.shtml Elyahu Green, Geographic names of places in Israel in Herodotos] This is confirmed by [[George Rawlinson]] in the third book (Thalia) of ''The Histories'' where ''Palaestinian Syrians'' are part of the fifth tax district spanning the territory from [[Phoenicia]] to the borders of Egypt, but excludes the ''kingdom of Arabs'' who were exempt from tax for providing the Assyrian army with water on its march to Egypt. These people had a large city called Cadytis, identified as Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately a century later, [[Aristotle]] used a similar definition in ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]'', writing &quot;Again if, as is fabled, there is a lake in Palestine, such that if you bind a man or beast and throw it in it floats and does not sink, this would bear out what we have said. They say that this lake is so bitter and salt that no fish live in it and that if you soak clothes in it and shake them it cleans them,&quot; understood by scholars to be a reference to the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html Meteorology By Aristotle]&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers such as [[Polemon of Athens|Polemon]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] also used the term to refer to the same region. This usage was followed by Roman writers such as [[Ovid]], [[Tibullus]], [[Pomponius Mela]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Dio Chrysostom]], [[Statius]], [[Plutarch]] as well as Roman Judean writers [[Philo of Alexandria]] and [[Josephus]]&lt;ref name=Robinson/&gt;. Other writers, such as [[Strabo]], a prominent Roman-era geographer (although he wrote in Greek), referred to the region as ''Coele-Syria'' around 10-20 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Hellenistic Judaism  ï¼Louis H. Feldman&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Hellenistic settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa ï¼Getzel M.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharonp4n&gt;Sharon, 1998, p. 4. According to Moshe Sharon: &quot;Eager to obliterate the name of the rebellious [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]]&quot;, the Roman authorities (General Hadrian) renamed it ''Palaestina'' or ''Syria Palaestina''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name ''Peleshet'' ({{lang|he|×¤××©×ª}} ''PÉlÃ©sheth'')- usually translated as ''Philistia'' in English, is used in the [[Bible]] more than 250 times. In the [[Torah]] / [[Pentateuch]] the term is used 10 times and its boundaries are undefined. The later [[Books of the Bible|Historical books]] (see [[Deuteronomistic history]]) include most of the biblical references, almost 200 of which are in the [[Book of Judges]] and the [[Books of Samuel]], where the term is used to denote the southern coastal region to the west of the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 1993, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharonp4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roomp285&gt;Room, 1997, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;Robinson, Edward, ''Physical geography of the Holy Land'', Crocker &amp; Brewster, Boston, 1865, p.15. Robinson, writing in 1865 when travel by Europeans to the Ottoman Empire became common asserts that, &quot;Palestine, or Palestina, now the most common name for the Holy Land, occurs three times in the English version of the Old Testament; and is there put for the [[Hebrew]] name ×¤××©×ª, elsewhere rendered Philistia. As thus used, it refers strictly and only to the country of the [[Philistines]], in the southwest corner of the land. So, too, in the Greek form, Î Î±Î»Î±ÏÏÎ¯Î½Î·), it is used by [[Josephus]]. But both Josephus and [[Philo]] apply the name to the whole land of the Hebrews ; and Greek and Roman writers employed it in the like extent.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]], the entire region (Syria Palestine, [[Samaria]], and the [[Galilee]]) was named ''Palaestina'', subdivided into provinces Palaestina I and II.&lt;ref name=Kaegip41/&gt; The Byzantines also renamed an area of land including the [[Negev]], [[Sinai]], and the west coast of the Arabian Peninsula as ''Palaestina Salutaris'', sometimes called ''Palaestina III''.&lt;ref name=Kaegip41&gt;Kaegi, 1995, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for Palestine is ÙÙØ³Ø·ÙÙ (commonly transcribed in English as ''Filistin'', ''Filastin'', or ''Falastin'').&lt;ref name=Marshallp559&gt;Marshall Cavendish, 2007, p. 559.&lt;/ref&gt; Moshe Sharon writes that when the [[Arab]]s took over [[Greater Syria]] in the 7th century, [[Place names of Palestine|place names]] that were in use by the Byzantine administration before them, generally continued to be used. Hence, he traces the emergence of the Arabic form ''Filastin'' to this adoption, with Arabic inflection, of Roman and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ([[Semitic]]) names.&lt;ref name=Sharonp4/&gt; Jacob Lassner and Selwyn Ilan Troen offer a different view, writing that ''Jund Filastin'', the full name for the administrative province under the rule of the Arab [[caliphates]], was traced by Muslim geographers back to the Philistines of the Bible.&lt;ref name=Lassnerp54&gt;Lassner and Troen, 2007, pp. 54â55.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the name &quot;Palestine&quot; in English became more common after the European renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun KrÃ¤mer (2008) ''A History of Palestine: From the Ottoman Conquest to the Founding of the State of Israel'' Translated by Gudrun KrÃ¤mer and Graham Harman Princeton University Press, ISBN 0-691-11897-3 p 16&lt;/ref&gt; It was officially revived by the British after the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and applied to the territory that was placed under the [[British Mandate for Palestine|Palestine Mandate]].

However, during the Roman Jerusalem period &quot;Palestine&quot; was not the only geographical term for the region. For example, [[Strabo]], in his description of Jerusalem and Judea, uses the term [[Coele-Syria]], and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] (as above) uses both terms.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Hellenistic Judaism - Page 558 Louis H. Feldman - 1996 &quot;Nevertheless, Pliny (Mturalis Historia 5.74, 77) and Strabo (16.2.16.754) do draw a distinction between the Decapolis and Coele-Syria.

The British Government had not accepted the use of this Arab title, but gave the place of honour to the Hebrew word used for 2,000 years and decided that the official name in Hebrew was &quot;Palestina&quot; followed by the initials signifying &quot;Aleph Jod&quot;, the regular Hebrew name. Was the question still under discussion and could the accredited representative give the Commission any further information? [[Stewart Symes|Colonel Symes]] explained that the country was described as &quot;Palestine&quot; by Europeans and as &quot;Falestin&quot; by the Arabs. The Hebrew name for the country was the designation &quot;Land of Israel&quot;, and the Government, to meet Jewish wishes, had agreed that the word &quot;Palestine&quot; in Hebrew characters should be followed in all official documents by the initials which stood for that designation. As a set-off to this, certain of the Arab politicians suggested that the country should be called &quot;Southern Syria&quot; in order to emphasise its close relation with another Arab State.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/9a798adbf322aff38525617b006d88d7/1504facc47efbe05052565f0006b70bb?OpenDocument Permanent Mandates Commission, 22nd meeting, minutes of the ninth session, Geneva, June 1926]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical references==
The Philistines and Philistia are mentioned more than 250 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OTS&quot;&gt;[http://www.oldtestamentstudies.net/patriarchs/philistines.asp?item=5&amp;variant=0 The Philistines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/keyword/index.php?search=philis*&amp;searchtype=all&amp;version1=9&amp;spanbegin=1&amp;spanend=73 Bible Gateway - All references to words beginning Philis*]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Killebrewp202&gt;Killebrew, 2005, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''Peleshet'' ({{lang|he|×¤××©×ª}} ''PÉlÃ©shseth'') - usually translated as ''Philistia'' in English, is used in the [[Bible]] to denote the southern coastal region that was inhabited by the [[Philistines]] (&quot;PliÅ¡tim&quot; ({{lang|he|×¤Ö°Ö¼×Ö´×©Ö°××ªÖ´Ö¼××}} ''PÉliÅ¡tÃ®m'')&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, 1993, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The Philistines first appear in a listing of the [[Ham (son of Noah)|Hamitic]] branch of [[Noah]]'s descendants.&lt;ref name=Smithp1546&gt;Smith, 1863, p. 1546.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Philistia'' is generally accepted to be a cognate of the word ''Palestine''. However, the terms for biblical ''Philistia'' and geographical ''Palestine'' have been different since at least the second century BCE. As early as the [[LXX]], thought to have been completed in 132 BCE, the biblical term for Philistines in Greek (''Philistieim'') was different to the contemporary Greek name for the region (''Palaistine'')&lt;ref&gt; Jacobson, p65&lt;/ref&gt;
