The '''2004 South Carolina Gamecocks football team''' represented the [[University of South Carolina]] in the [[Southeastern Conference]] during the [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season]].

Although they were bowl eligble, South Carolina declined to accept a bid due to the team's involvement in the [[Clemson University&amp;nbsp;â University of South Carolina brawl|Carolina-Clemson brawl]].

==Schedule==
The September 11 game against Georgia played host to ESPN's [[College Gameday]].
