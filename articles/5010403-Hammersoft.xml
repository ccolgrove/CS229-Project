== The Voices of Gwynedd ==
The Voices of Gwynedd is a 100-member choir composed of full- and part-time students, faculty, staff, alumni and friends of Gwynedd-Mercy College. Directed by Carol Evans, a seasoned soprano and assistant professor of music in the College's School of Arts and Sciences, the choir has developed into a highly professional choral ensemble presenting quality programs representing many different genres. Performances by the choir and its musical collaborators are establishing the college as a strong cultural presence in Southeastern Pennsylvania and the entire Tri-state area.

Enriching the campus and the region, the Voices of Gwynedd provide on-campus concerts and events throughout the year, currently attracting its largest audiences ever. In addition, the ensemble has represented the College at a number of high profile regional events.  Their most recent regional events include performances at Longwood Gardens and the Philadelphia Phillies games, and in August 2008 the Eagles! In addition, for the past four years the Voices have been joining hundreds of Breast Cancer Survivors in their search for a cure by performing at the opening ceremonies at the Race for the Cure on the steps of the Art Museum in Philadelphia. Other notable performances include performing with Barry Manilow on The Ultimate Manilow Concert Tour, JoDee Messina on her Christmas Tour, Broadway singer Linda Eder on her Holiday Tour, and as the featured choir with Judy Collins on her Christmas Tour in 2002.

The group has expanded its repertoire with concert tours in England, Italy, Canada, Alaska, Nashville, San Diego, Washington D.C., Virginia, the American Southwest and performances for Spanish Missions, U.S. Naval Bases and most recently Ireland where we sang at the Mercy International Centre in Dublin, home of the Sisters of Mercy. The Voices of Gwynedd were also selected to perform at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida where ensemble members worked one-on-one with the Disney's professional singers, providing music enhancement and motivation. The group was invited to New York City to perform at the Lincoln Center for Performing Arts&quot;Music Makers&quot; program in March 1998. In spring 2003 the Voices of Gwynedd sang at Carnegie Hall performing the Mozart Requiem.

To help commemorate Gwynedd-Mercy College's 60th Anniversary, the ensemble accompanied the Ireland Heritage Tour, performing for a variety of concert venues throughout Ireland. The Voices traveled to San Diego, CA in the spring 1999 and performed at Spanish Missions, the U.S. Naval Base, and Walt Disneyland in Los Angeles. During recent summers, the choir successfully completed international concert tours to England, Italy and Ireland.

The Voices were honored in 1999 when they were asked to sing at the world premiere grand finale of Leslie Burr's opera Vanqui, at Opera Columbus in Columbus, Ohio. Subsequently the Voices have participated in additional presentations of Vanqui at the National Opera Association convention in Philadelphia in 2002 and at the Schomburg Center for Research and Black Culture in New York City in 2004. The Voices again served as the Opera Chorus for Opera North's production of Vanqui in May 2005 at the Prince Theater in Philadelphia.
