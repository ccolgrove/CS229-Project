The following is a '''timeline of Occupy Oakland''' (sometimes called '''OO''' or '''#OO''') which began on Monday, October 10, 2011, as an [[occupation (protest)|occupation]] of [[Frank H. Ogawa Plaza]], a plaza located beside [[Oakland City Hall]] in [[downtown Oakland]], and is an ongoing demonstration. It is allied with [[Occupy Wall Street]], which began in New York City on September 17, 2011, and is one of several [[List of Occupy movement protest locations|&quot;Occupy&quot; protest sites]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Other sites include [[Occupy San Francisco]] and [[Occupy San Jose]]. 

Occupy Oakland was inspired by the [[Occupy movement]], which in turn was inspired by the [[Arab Spring]] and [[2010â2011 Greek protests|Greek]], [[2011 Spanish protests|Spanish]], [[2011 United Kingdom anti-austerity protests|British]], [[2011 Chilean protests|Chilean]], and [[2011 Israeli middle class protests|Israeli]] protest movements. A precursor in the United States was the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] occurring from late winter through the spring. More specific to Oakland, OO was inspired by local protest history, including protests in response to the [[BART Police shooting of Oscar Grant]] in 2009{{mdash}}2010.
