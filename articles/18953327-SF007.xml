'''Oracle VM VirtualBox''' is an [[x86 virtualization]] software package, originally created by software company Innotek GmbH, purchased by [[Sun Microsystems]], and now developed by [[Oracle Corporation]] as part of its family of virtualization products. It is installed on an existing host operating system; within this application, additional guest operating systems, each known as a ''Guest OS'', can be loaded and run, each with its own virtual environment.

Supported host operating systems include [[Linux]], [[Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[OpenSolaris]]; there is also a port to [[FreeBSD]] (only OSE version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.freebsd.org/VirtualBox |title=VirtualBox - FreeBSD Wiki |publisher=Wiki.freebsd.org |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supported guest operating systems include versions and derivations of [[Windows]], [[Linux]], [[BSD]], [[OS/2]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Guest_OSes |title=Guest_OSes |publisher=VirtualBox |date=2009-06-12 |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since release 3.2.0, VirtualBox also allows limited virtualization of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} guests on Apple hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifehacker.com/5530521/virtualbox-32-beta-virtualizes-mac-os-x-on-macs VirtualBox 3.2 Beta Virtualizes Mac OS X (On Macs)], May 4, 2010, By Kevin Purdy, Lifehacker&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2010 surveys by [[LinuxJournal.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/readers-choice-awards-2010 |title=2010 Linux Journal Readers' Choice Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[LifeHacker.com]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lifehacker.com/5715803/best-virtual-machine-application-virtualbox |title=LifeHacker.com Best Virtual Machine Application}}&lt;/ref&gt;, VirtualBox was the most popular virtualization product with over 50% of the vote.

Since version 4.1, Windows guests on supported hardware can take advantage of the recently implemented [[Windows Display Driver Model|WDDM]] driver included in the guest additions, this allows [[Windows Aero]] to be enabled along with [[Direct3D]] support. Macintosh computers with supported hardware can also enable these new features.

==History==
Innotek initially offered the application under a [[proprietary software]] license. One version of the product was available at no cost for personal or evaluation use, subject to the VirtualBox Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL |title=VirtualBox_PUEL - VirtualBox |publisher=VirtualBox |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) was released as [[free software]], subject to the requirements of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), version 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/GPL |title=GPL |publisher=VirtualBox |date= |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original developer, ''innotek'', also contributed to the development of [[OS/2]] and [[Linux]] support in virtualization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronny Ong &amp;nbsp; View profile &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;More options |url=http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.virtualpc/msg/1dbfbc16da8ac9af |title=Additions Version History - microsoft.public.virtualpc &amp;#124; Google Groups |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and OS/2 ports&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_July_1/ai_88090458 |title=Connectix Announces First Virtual Computing Solution for OS/2 Users; Virtual PC Lets Enterprises Run OS/2 and Windows Concurrently on a Single PC &amp;#124; Business Wire &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= 2002-07-01|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of products from [[Connectix]] which were later acquired by [[Microsoft]]. Specifically, innotek developed the âadditionsâ code in both [[Microsoft Virtual PC]] and [[Microsoft Virtual Server]], which greatly improves host-guest OS interactions.

[[Sun Microsystems]] acquired innotek in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

==Licensing==

With version 4 of Virtualbox, released in December 2010, the core package is [[free software]] released under [[GNU General Public License#Version 2|GNU General Public License version 2]] (GPLv2). This is the fully featured package, excluding some  proprietary components not available under GPLv2.  These components provide support for [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] 2.0 devices, [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] and [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE boot]] for Intel cards and are released as a separate &quot;VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox extension pack&quot; under a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] Personal Use and Evaluation License (PUEL), which permits use of the software for personal use, educational use, or evaluation, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox_PUEL |title=VirtualBox_PUEL |publisher=VirtualBox |date=2010-04-19 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to version 4, there were two different packages of the VirtualBox software.  The full package was offered free under the PUEL, with licenses for other commercial deployment purchasable from Oracle.  A second package called the ''VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE)'' was released under GPLv2.  This removed the same  proprietary components not available under GPLv2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Licensing_FAQ | title= Licensing FAQ | publisher= VirtualBox | accessdate= 2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Editions |title=Editions |publisher=VirtualBox |date= |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[end user license agreement]] of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} does not permit the operating system to run on non-Apple hardware, enforced within the operating system by calls to the Apple [[System Management Controller]] (SMC) in all Apple machines, which verifies the authenticity of the hardware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twit.tv/floss130 Interview with Andy Hall, Product Manager for Oracle VM VirtualBox]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emulated environment==
Multiple guest OSs can be loaded under the host operating system (host OS). Each guest can be started, paused and stopped independently within its own [[virtual machine]] (VM).  The user can independently configure each VM and run it under a choice of [[x86 virtualization#Software-based virtualization|software emulation]] or [[x86 virtualization#Hardware assist|hardware assisted emulation]] if the underlying host hardware supports this.  The host OS and guest OSs and applications can communicate with each other through a number of mechanisms including a common clipboard and a virtualized network facility provided.  Guest VMs can also directly communicate with each other if configured to do so.

===Software emulation===
In software emulation mode, VirtualBox adopts a standard [[x86 virtualization#Software-based virtualization|software emulation]] approach.  This mode supports 32-bit guest OSs which run in rings 0 and 3 of the Intel [[ring (computer security)|ring]] architecture. 
* The guest OS code, running in ring 0, is reconfigured to execute in ring 1 on the host hardware.  Because this code contains many privileged instructions which cannot run natively in ring 1, VirtualBox employs a Code Scanning and Analysis Manager (CSAM) to scan the ring 0 code recursively before its first execution to identify problematic instructions and then calls the Patch Manager (PATM) to perform in-situ patching.  This replaces the instruction with a jump to a VM-safe equivalent compiled code fragment in hypervisor memory.
* The guest user-mode code, running in the ring 3, is generally run directly on the host hardware at ring 3. 
In both cases, VirtualBox uses CSAM and PATM to inspect and patch the offending instructions whenever a fault occurs.  VirtualBox also contains a [[Dynamic recompilation|dynamic recompiler]], based on [[QEMU]] to recompile any [[real mode]] or [[protected mode]] code entirely (e.g. BIOS code, a DOS guest, or any operating system startup).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#idp13728752 |title=VirtualBox Manual, Section 10.4  Details about software virtualization |publisher=VirtualBox |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using these techniques, VirtualBox can achieve a performance that is comparable to that of [[VMware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Oliver Diedrich |url=http://www.heise.de/open/artikel/83678 |title=heise open - 15.01.07 - VirtualBox |publisher=Heise.de |date=2007-01-15 |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Perlow|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/perlow/virtualization-smackdown-2-oracle-vm-virtualbox-32-vs-vmware-workstation-71/13020 |title=Virtualization Smackdown 2: Oracle VM VirtualBox 3.2 vs. VMware Workstation 7.1|publisher=ZDNET |date=2010-05-21 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware-assisted emulation===
VirtualBox supports both [[Intel]]'s [[x86 virtualization#Intel Virtualization Technology for x86 .28Intel VT-x.29|VT-x]] and [[AMD]]'s [[x86 virtualization#AMD virtualization (AMD-V)|AMD-V]] hardware virtualization. Making use of these facilities, VirtualBox can run each guest VM in its own separate address space; the guest OS ring 0 code runs on the host at ring 0 in VMX non-root mode rather than in ring 1.

Some guests, including 64-bit guests, SMP guests and certain proprietary OSs, are only supported by VirtualBox on hosts with hardware-assisted emulation.

===Hardware device emulation===
Hard disks are emulated in one of three disk image formats: a VirtualBox-specific container format, called &quot;Virtual Disk Image&quot; (VDI), which are stored as files (with a .vdi suffix) on the host operating system; [[VMware]] [[VMDK|Virtual Machine Disk Format (VMDK)]]; and [[Microsoft Virtual PC]] [[VHD (file format)|VHD format]]. A VirtualBox virtual machine can, therefore, use disks that were created in VMware or Microsoft Virtual PC, as well as its own native format.  VirtualBox can also connect to [[iSCSI]] targets and to raw partitions on the host, using either as virtual hard disks. VirtualBox emulates [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] (PIIX4 and ICH6 controllers), [[SCSI]], [[SATA]] (ICH8M controller) and [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]] controllers to which hard drives can be attached.

Both [[ISO image]]s and host-connected physical devices can be mounted as CD/DVD drives. For example, the DVD image of a Linux distribution can be downloaded and used directly by VirtualBox.

By default VirtualBox provides graphics support through a custom virtual graphics card that is [[VESA]] compatible. The Guest Additions for Windows, Linux, Solaris, OpenSolaris, or OS/2 guests include a special video driver that increases video performance and includes additional features, such as automatically adjusting the guest resolution when resizing the VM window&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#id448025 |title=Chapter 4. Guest Additions |publisher=VirtualBox |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or desktop composition via virtualized [[Windows Display Driver Model|WDDM]] drivers .

For an [[Ethernet]] network adapter, VirtualBox virtualizes these [[Network card|Network Interface Cards]]: AMD PCnet PCI II (Am79C970A), AMD PCnet-Fast III (Am79C973), Intel Pro/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM), Intel Pro/1000 MT Server (82545EM), and Intel Pro/1000 T Server (82543GC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#nichardware |title=Chapter 6. Virtual networking |publisher=VirtualBox |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emulated network cards allow most guest OSs to run without the need to find and install drivers for networking hardware as they are shipped as part of the guest OS. By default, VirtualBox uses [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] through which Internet software for end users such as [[Firefox]] or [[Secure Shell|ssh]] can operate. Bridged networking via a host network adapter or virtual networks between guests can also be configured. Up to eight network adapters can be attached simultaneously, but only four are configurable through the graphical interface.

For a sound card, VirtualBox virtualizes Intel HD Audio, Intel ICH AC'97 device and [[SoundBlaster 16]] cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch03.html#settings-audio |title=Chapter 3. Configuring Virtual Machines |publisher=VirtualBox |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A USB 1.1 controller is emulated so that any USB devices attached to the host can be seen in the guest. The closed source extension pack adds a USB 2.0 controller and, if VirtualBox acts as an RDP server, it can also use USB devices on the remote RDP client as if they were connected to the host, although only if the client supports this VirtualBox-specific extension (Oracle provides clients for Solaris, Linux and [[Sun Ray]] thin clients that can do this, and have promised support for other platforms in future versions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

===Virtual Disk Image===
VirtualBox uses its own format for storage containers &amp;ndash; Virtual Disk Image (VDI).
VirtualBox also supports other well-known storage formats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/User Guide/Virtual storage |title=Virtual storage |publisher=VirtualBox |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2009-10-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[VMDK]] (used in particular by [[VMware]]) as well as the [[VHD (file format)|VHD format]] used by [[Microsoft]].

VirtualBox's command-line utility &lt;code&gt;VBoxManage&lt;/code&gt; includes options for cloning disks and importing and exporting file systems, however, it does not include a tool for increasing the size of the filesystem within a VDI container: this can be achieved in many ways with third-party tools or in the guest OS itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=364&amp;start=30 |title=Howto increase hard disk size after installing a guest OS |publisher=End user forums for VirtualBox |date=2009-10-30 |accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VirtualBox has supported [[Open Virtualization Format]] (OVF) since version 2.2.0 (April 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-2.2 | title = VirtualBox changelog | accessdate = 2010-02-18}}
