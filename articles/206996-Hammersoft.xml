One month after the ''Daily Express'' article, Twiggy posed for her first shoot for ''Vogue''. A year later, she had appeared in 13 separate fashion shoots in international ''Vogue'' editions.

===1967â1970===
Twiggy arrived in [[New York]] in March 1967 at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK airport]], an event covered by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl-8Pej7bHo&amp;feature=related |title=Twiggy Press Conference |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported on the Twiggy &quot;phenomenon&quot; in 1967, with the ''New Yorker'' devoting nearly 100 pages to the subject.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;twiggy60&quot; /&gt; That year she became an international sensation, modelling in France, Japan, and America,&lt;ref name=&quot;twigbiochannel&quot; /&gt; and landing the cover of Paris ''Vogue'' in May,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hauteworld.blogspot.com/2009/10/vogue-covers-1920-2009-paris-france.html |title=Vogue Covers 1920-2009 (Paris, France)|publisher=Hauteworld.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cover of US ''Vogue'' three times, in April, July and November, and the cover of British ''Vogue'' in October.&lt;ref name=&quot;eyelashes&quot; /&gt; In 1967, an editorial on p. 63 of the March 15 edition of ''Vogue'' described her as an &quot;extravaganza that makes the look of the sixties.&quot;

The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s 2009 catalogue of ''Style: Model as Muse Embodying Fashion'' stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Twiggy's adolescent physique was the perfect frame for the androgynous styles that began to emerge in the 1960s. The trend was manifested in a number of templates: sweet A-line dresses with collars and neckties, suits and dresses that took their details from military uniforms, or, in the case of [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], and explicit transposition of the male tuxedo to women. Simultaneously, under the rubric of 'unisex,' designs that were minimalistic, including Nehru suits and space-agey jumpsuits, were proposed by designers such as [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[Andre Courreges]], and, most famously in the U.S.A., by [[Rudi Gernreich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityreview.com/modelmuse.html |title=Style: Model as Muse at the Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Thecityreview.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Twiggy has been photographed by such noted photographers as [[Cecil Beaton]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Melvin Sokolsky]], Ronald Traeger, [[Bert Stern]], [[Norman Parkinson]], [[Annie Leibovitz]] and [[Steven Meisel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeinphotos&quot; /&gt;

===Reaction===

Twiggy and the magazines featuring her image polarised critics from the start. Her boyishly thin image was criticized as, and is still blamed for, promoting an &quot;unhealthy&quot; body ideal for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ap.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/30/3/257 |title=Body Image, Media, and Eating Disorders |author = Derenne and Beresin |volume = 30 |number = 3 |page = 257 |journal = Acad Psychiatry |doi=10.1176/appi.ap.30.3.257 |publisher=Ap.psychiatryonline.org |date=2006-01-30 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.times.com/specials/magazine4/articles/twiggy.html|title = Stick Thin|author = Susan Cheever}}{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Twiggy came along at a time when teen-age spending power was never greater,&quot; said Su Dalgleish, fashion correspondent for the London Daily Mail. &quot;With that underdeveloped, boyish figure, she is an idol to the 14- and 15-year-old kids. She makes virtue of all the terrible things of [[gawky]], miserable, adolescence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;click&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=sentimentalsusan |url=http://modsixties.5forum.net/susan-camp-editors-updates-f9/new-twiggy-1967-newsweek-cover-article-t476.htm |title=NEW Twiggy 1967 Newsweek Cover &amp; Article |publisher=Modsixties.5forum.net |date= |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of her fame, Mark Cohen, president of Leeds women's shop had an even harsher view: &quot;Her legs remind me of two painted worms.&quot; Yet Twiggy had her supporters. [[Diana Vreeland]] of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' stated, &quot;She's no flash in the pan. She is the mini-girl in the mini-era. She's delicious looking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;click&quot; /&gt; In recent years Twiggy has spoken out against the trend of waif-thin models, explaining that her own thin weight as a teenager was natural: &quot;&quot;I was very skinny, but that was just my natural build. I always ate sensibly â being thin was in my genes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/america-next-top-model-judge-twiggy-too-thin-models-terrifying-1010539.php |title='America's Next Top Model' judge Twiggy: Too thin models &quot;terrifying&quot;|publisher=Reality TV World |date=2006-11-19 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 1969, despite being 20 years old, she was selected as the special guest for one of the first editions of the UK television series [[This_Is_Your_Life_(UK_TV_series)|This Is Your Life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eofftv.com/t/thi/this_is_your_life_1969_main.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage, film, television and singing career==
===1970â1979===

After four years of modelling, Twiggy retired in 1970, claiming &quot;You can't be a clothes hanger for your entire life!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Anna |last=Slater |title=Twiggy at 60; The super-skinny model who found fame in the Sixties has finally come of age.

Twiggy embarked on an award-winning acting and singing career, starring in a variety of roles on stage and screen, and recording albums. In 1971, she made her film debut as an extra in [[Ken Russell]]'s ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]''. The same year, she performed her first leading role in features as Polly Browne in Ken Russell's adaptation of [[Sandy Wilson]]'s pastiche of 1920s hit musicals ''[[The Boy Friend]]''. This marked her initial collaboration with [[Tommy Tune]], and won her two [[30th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards in 1972]] ([[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year â Actress|New Star of the Year - Actress]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress â Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy]]). In 1974, she made her [[West End theatre|West End]] stage debut in ''[[Cinderella]]'', and made a second feature, the thriller ''[[W (1974 film)|W]]''; co-starred with future husband Michael Whitney, and hosted her own British television series, ''Twiggs'' (later renamed ''Twiggy'').

In October 1975, she sang at the live performance of [[Roger Glover]]'s [[The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast]] album at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. The concert was filmed and produced by [[Tony Klinger]] and released to theaters in 1976.

In November, 1976 she made an appearance on ''[[The Muppet Show]],'' in which she sang &quot;In My Life,&quot; a Beatles song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q407R9QskPU&amp;feature=related |title=The Muppet Show Season 1 Episode 21 Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_121:_Twiggy |title=Episode 121: Twiggy|publisher=Muppet.wikia.com |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Twiggy signed to Mercury records and released the albums ''Twiggy'' and ''Please Get My Name Right'', discs that contained both pop and country tunes. ''Twiggy'' sold very well, peaking on the UK charts at no.33, and gave Twiggy a silver disc for good sales. The album contains Twiggy's top twenty hit single, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;. &quot;Please Get My Name Right&quot; made it to no.35 in 1977.A single A Woman In Love,failed to chart for Twiggy in 1977 but was a hit for the Three Degrees in 1978.

In 1978, the television distribution arm of [[American International Pictures]], in an effort to gain additional syndication value in the U.S. to the [[London Weekend Television|LWT]] rock music series ''[[Supersonic (TV series)|Supersonic]]'', repackaged the musical performances with Twiggy replacing [[Mike Mansfield Productions|Mike Mansfield]]'s introductions. The new series was titled ''[[Twiggy's Jukebox]]'', and ran in most of the major television markets in the U.S. during the 1978-1978 TV season. Coincidentally, Twiggy herself had performed &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Vanilla Ole&quot; on ''Supersonic'' in September 1976, and these performances were included in the refurbished program. After the initial season, Twiggy left the series, and American International Television continued ''[[Twiggy's Jukebox|Jukebox]]'' with [[Britt Ekland]] as host, using standard [[music videos]] rather than clips from ''Supersonic''.

===1980â1999===

In 1980 Twiggy made a cameo appearance in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. She starred as Eliza Doolittle in 1981 opposite Robert Powell in the Yorkshire TV production of ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' and in 1983, she made her Broadway debut in the musical, ''[[My One and Only]]'', starring and co-staged by Tommy Tune, for which she earned a [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination. In 1986 She played opposite [[Robin Williams]] In the comedy ''[[Club Paradise]]''. In 1987, she played a vaudeville performer in the British television special ''[[The Little Match Girl]]'' and in 1988, she appeared in a supporting role in ''[[Madame Sousatzka]]'' opposite second husband Leigh Lawson. In 1989, she was cast as Hannah Chaplin, mother to Charles, in the British television movie ''Young Charlie Chaplin''; aired in the United States on PBS' ''[[WonderWorks]]''.

In 1991, she co-starred in her first American network dramatic television series, the short-lived CBS sitcom ''[[Princesses]]''. Of eight episodes completed, only five aired. In 1997, Twiggy acted in the Chichester Festival Theatre revival of [[Noel Coward]]'s ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]''. A year later, she played Gertrude Lawrence in the biographical stage revue ''[[Noel Coward|Noel]] and Gertie'' at Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, Long Island. In 1999, she returned to the New York stage in an off-Broadway production ''If Love Were All'', a revised version of ''Noel and Gertie'', written and directed by Leigh Lawson; what set this edition apart were its tap numbers in period style. She starred as Gertrude Lawrence opposite Harry Groener's Noel Coward.

===2000â2009===

In 2001, Twiggy co-hosted the British magazine programme ''[[This Morning (TV series)|This Morning]]''. In 2003, she released another album, ''Midnight Blue''. Seventeen of the CD's 20 tracks had previously unreleased material from 1982â1990, including a duet with Leo Sayer, 'Save The Last Dance For Me' &amp; a cover of the Stones' 'Ruby Tuesday'. ''Feel Emotion'' and ''Diamond'' have both been released onto CD format since. In 2005, she joined the cast of the television show ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' for Cycles 5-9 as one of four judges, and a year later, she appeared on the cover of the Icons issue of ''SWINDLE'' magazine. She also returned to modelling, fronting a major television, press and billboard campaign for [[Marks &amp; Spencer]], the British department store chain. Her involvement in the advertising campaign has been credited for reviving Marks and Spencer's fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/twiggy-this-years-model-again-510583.html |title=Twiggy: This year's model. Again - This Britain, UK |publisher=The Independent |date=2005-10-12 |accessdate=2010-05-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she portrayed herself as a nineteen-year-old in the radio play ''Elevenses with Twiggy'' for BBC Radio 4's ''[[The Afternoon Play (BBC)|Afternoon Play]]'' series. She did not return to ''America's Next Top Model'' in its tenth season due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/dailydish/detail?blogid=7&amp;entry_id=22273 |title=Twiggy Quits 'America's Next Top Model' |publisher=SFGate |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2010-05-01 | first=Karen | last=Reardanz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her replacement was model

Also in 2007, Sepia Records released a previously shelved album that Twiggy recorded in 1979, produced by Donna Summer and Juergen Koppers. ''Heaven In My Eyes [&quot;Discotheque&quot;]'' contains the eight original tracks due to be released, plus four remixes by [[The Outsider]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}. The album was also made available on iTunes. She is signed to London agency [[Models 1]]. In 2008, she supported the ''[http://www.targetbreastcancer.org.uk Fashion Targets Breast Cancer]'' campaign in support of [[Breakthrough Breast Cancer]], alongside fellow celebrities&amp;nbsp;â comedian [[Alan Carr]], singer [[Natalie Imbruglia]], actress [[Anna Friel]] and DJ &amp; presenter [[Edith Bowman]].

In the summer of 2009, beauty company Olay debuted its &quot;Definity Eye Cream&quot; campaign depicting Twiggy. Accusations of airbrushing created a stir with the media and public. A website campaign set up by Jo Swinson, the Scottish Liberal Democrat MP, attracted 700 individual complaints.&lt;ref name=&quot;airbrush&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8415176.stm |title=Airbrushed Twiggy photo 'misleading' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] admitted to minor retouching and replaced the image. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) announced that the ad gave a âmisleadingâ impression, but that no further action was required because the image had already been withdrawn. Its announcement said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, we considered that the post-production re-touching of this ad, specifically in the eye area, could give consumers a misleading impression of the effect the product could achieve. We considered that the combination of references to &quot;younger looking eyes&quot;, including the claim &quot;reduces the look of wrinkles and dark circles for brighter, younger looking eyes&quot;, and post-production re-touching of Twiggyâs image around the eye area, was likely to mislead.&lt;ref name=&quot;airbrush&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==2010 to present==

Twiggy remains in the forefront of fashion for women of her age. She was the only one of the famous celebrities to survive being cut from the Mark &amp; Spencer fashion team in 2010, when [[Dannii Minogue]] joined her for the spring/summer women's wear campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article7019827.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Fiona | last=Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; She's also started an [[HSN]] fashion line called the Twiggy London collection&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stylelist.com/2010/03/24/twiggy-on-her-new-hsn-fashion-line-and-embracing-aging/ Twiggy on Her New HSN Fashion Line&lt;/ref&gt;, and has begun a fashion blog to discuss the line.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.hsn.com/author/twiggy/ HSN Blog by Twiggy&lt;/ref&gt; Women in their 60's and 70's are remaining stylish today, and this trend has been termed the &quot;Twiggy effect&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1258469/Growing-old-stylishly-Twiggy-effect-proves-age-barrier-fashion-fans.html#ixzz1SzhULgol Growing Old Stylishly, Daily Mail&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21st November 2011 Twiggy will release ''Romantically Yours'' through EMI, her first album in 12 years. It is a collection of pop and easy listening standards spanning several generations. The album features versions of such compositions as âBewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,â âBlue Moon,â âMy Funny Valentine,â âSomeone To Watch Over Meâ and âThey Canât Take That Away From Me.â The album also includes a guest vocal appearance by Twiggyâs daughter Carly Lawson on Neil Youngâs âOnly Love Can Break Your Heartâ, a guitar solo by Bryan Adams, and a version of Richard Marxâs âRight Here Waitingâ featuring duet vocals with the American songwriter himself. 
''Romantically Yours'' was produced by James McMillan, whose resumÃ© includes playing trumpet for Sade and James Brown.
