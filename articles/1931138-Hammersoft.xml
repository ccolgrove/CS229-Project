The '''rivalry between the [[Boston Celtics]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]]''' involves the two most storied [[basketball]] franchises in [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1003/nba.best.rivalries/content.1.html|title=NBA;s Best Rivalries|accessdate=June 3, 2011|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two teams have met a record twelve times in the [[NBA Finals]], starting with their first Finals meeting in {{nbafy|1959}}.  They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 60s and three times in the 80s.

The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Larry Bird]] in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4â2. They faced off once again in the [[2010 NBA Finals]] which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams have won the two highest numbers of championships, the Celtics 17, the Lakers 16; together, the 33 championships account for more than half of the [[List of NBA champions|65 championships]] in NBA history.

==Overview==
As of 2010, the Lakers and Celtics have met 12 times in the Finals. To date, Boston has won nine and L.A. three (with the Celtics having won the first eight).

==History==
===Minneapolis and Boston===
During the first decade of the NBA in the 1950s, the Minneapolis Lakers had the first NBA dynasty. Minneapolis would win the first ever Championship Series of the newly formed NBA in [[1950 NBA Finals|1950]] (three BAA Finals were played between 1947â1949 and retroactively counted as NBA Championships, one of which was won by the Lakers in [[1949 NBA Finals|1949]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19481949.html|title=Mikan, Lakers Begin Championship Run|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19491950.html|title=Lakers: First Champs of Newly Formed NBA|accessdate=May 14, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Minneapolis Lakers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1950.html|title=1949â50 NBA Season Summary|accessdate=October 31, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|work=basketball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Hall of Fame head coach [[John Kundla]], and with the NBA's first superstar in [[George Mikan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mike&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Barreiro|first=Don|title=George Mikan: The First Icon|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/mikan_icon_050602.html|work=From the Official NBA Encyclopedia, Third Edition|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  they would win three more titles in [[1952 NBA Finals|1952]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19511952.html|title= Lakers Reclaim the NBA Crown|accessdate=May 14, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1953 NBA Finals|1953]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19521953.html|title=Lakers Unstoppable in Big Apple|accessdate=May 14, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1954 NBA Finals|1954]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19531954.html|title=Minneapolis Makes One Last Title Run|accessdate=May 14, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Celtics would emerge behind early NBA star [[Bob Cousy]] by winning the [[1957 NBA Finals]]&lt;ref name=1957Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19561957.html|title= Celtics Officially Launch Their Dynasty|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and losing in [[1958 NBA Finals|1958]].&lt;ref name=1958Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19571958.html|title=Pettit Drops 50 on Celtics in Game 6|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first NBA Finals match-up between the two teams was in [[1959 NBA Finals|1959]] when the Boston Celtics swept the Minneapolis Lakers.&lt;ref name=1959Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19581959.html|title=Celtics Sweep Past Minneapolis|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would mark the first Finals loss for the previously dominant Lakers, and the first of eight straight titles for Boston.&lt;ref name=8straight/&gt;

===Los Angeles Lakers and Celtics Dynasty===
The Lakers relocated to Los Angeles in 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the Lakers # 10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html#10 |title=History of the Lakers # 10 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |work= |publisher=Lakers.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was after this move, and during this decade, that the rivalry would truly escalate. The two teams emerged as the strongest in the NBA, featuring greats such as [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]], [[Tom Heinsohn]], [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]] and head coach [[Red Auerbach]] for Boston and [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jerry West]], [[Gail Goodrich]], and coach/GM [[Fred Schaus]] for Los Angeles. However, it would ultimately prove to be the decade of the Celtics, who won the finals every year in the 1960s except for [[1967 NBA Finals|1967]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19661967.html|title=Prolific Sixers Bring Ring to Philly|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lakers would be the Celtics opponent in six of those series: [[1962 NBA Finals|1962]],&lt;ref name=1962Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19611962.html|title=Celtics, Lakers Work OT to Start Rivalry|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1963 NBA Finals|1963]],&lt;ref name=1963Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19621963.html|title=Cousy Retires as Six-Time Champion|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1965 NBA Finals|1965]],&lt;ref name=1965Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19641965.html|title=Celtics Win Seventh Straight Finals|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1966 NBA Finals|1966]],&lt;ref name=1966Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19651966.html|title=Red Lights Cigar to Close Coaching Career|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1968 NBA Finals|1968]],&lt;ref name=1968Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19671968.html|title=Boston is Alive and Well|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[1969 NBA Finals|1969]].&lt;ref name=1969Finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19681969.html|title=West's Heroics Can't Deprive Russell of 11th Title|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Celtics won all of those match-ups. Three of those series (1962, 1966, and 1969) have gone seven games.  The Celtics win over the Lakers in 1966 marked an unprecedented eight consecutive championships, the longest streak of any North American professional sports team.&lt;ref name=8straight&gt;[http://www.worldalmanac.com/blog/2007/01/unbreakable_sports_records.html &quot;Unbreakable&quot; Sports Records (The World Almanac)] worldalmanac.com, accessed April 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers acquired [[Wilt Chamberlin]] in 1968&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/chamberlain_bio.html |title=Wilt Chamberlain Bio |accessdate=October 25, 2008 |work= |publisher=NBA.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and posted the best record in the West during the 1968â1969 season. By contrast, the aging Celtics struggled to obtain the fourth seed, with Russell and Jones playing in their final seasons. Despite this, the Celtics upset the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and the [[New York Knicks]] and made it to the Finals. The Lakers had home court advantage for the first time and won the first two games, but the Celtics rebounded to force and win a dramatic Game 7 at the [[The Forum (Inglewood)|Los Angeles Forum]], defying Laker's owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]]'s infamous prediction of a Lakers celebration.&lt;ref name=heller/&gt; West was named Finals MVP despite being on the losing team,&lt;ref name=&quot;1969Finals&quot; /&gt; but it was small consolation in a decade where the Lakers went without a championship, every one of their Finals' losses in that decade coming at the hands of the Celtics.&lt;ref name=taylor336_353/&gt;

===Championships but no rematch===
The Lakers and Celtics both found success in the 1970s, but there would be no rematch between the two teams.

The start of the decade saw the Lakers' woes in the NBA Finals continue, with a loss to the [[New York Knicks]] in [[1970 NBA Finals|1970]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19691970.html|title=Gutsy Reed Rallies Knicks in Game 7|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Lakers rebounded two years later to win the [[1972 NBA Finals]] and their first championship in Los Angeles, also against the Knicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19711972.html|title=Lakers' Legendary Season Leads to Elusive Title|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This would also prove to be Laker great Jerry West's only NBA title. The following year, the Lakers again faced the Knicks in the [[1973 NBA Finals]] and lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19721973.html|title=Knicks Win One for the 'Aged'|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would not make it to the Finals again in this decade, but in 1975 they acquired [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lazenby|first=Roland|title=The Show: The Inside Story of the Spectacular Los Angeles Lakers In The Words of Those Who Lived It|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0071430342|authorlink=Roland Lazenby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celtics won the NBA Finals in [[1974 NBA Finals|1974]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19731974.html|title=Celtics Win First Title of Post-Russell Era|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won again in [[1976 NBA Finals|1976]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19751976.html|title=Triple-OT Classic Highlights Boston's 13th Title|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of coach [[Tom Heinsohn]] and players [[Dave Cowens]], [[Paul Silas]] and [[Jo Jo White]].

Neither team won another championship until the 1980s. However, the foundation for the renewed CelticsâLakers rivalry of the 1980s was actually laid down in college basketball of the late 1970s. During the 1978â79 NCAA season, Michigan State was led by [[Magic Johnson]] to the championship game of the NCAA Tournament, where they faced Indiana State University, which was led by senior [[Larry Bird]]. In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/century/katz.html|title=From coast to coast, a magical pair|last=Katz|first=Andy|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75â64, and Johnson was voted Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnshowtime&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry|last=Schwartz|title=Magic made Showtime a show|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016111.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic Johnson would go on to be drafted by the Lakers, and Larry Bird by the Celtics. The personal rivalry formed by these two basketball greats during college would transfer to their NBA careers, and reignite the rivalry between the two storied franchises that they came to represent.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnshowtime&quot;/&gt;

===Magic and Larry===
[[Image:Magic Bird Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|left|Los Angeles Lakers Magic Johnson tangles with Boston Celtics Larry Bird in Game two of the 1985 NBA Finals at Boston Garden.]]
The Lakers-Celtics rivalry was renewed in the 1980s.  The &quot;Showtime Lakers&quot; struck the first blow, winning the [[1980 NBA Finals]] against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19791980.html|title=Rookie Makes the Lakers Believe in Magic|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, behind the &quot;Big Three&quot; of future Hall of Famers Larry Bird, [[Kevin McHale]], and [[Robert Parish]], the Celtics won the [[1981 NBA Finals]] against the [[Houston Rockets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19801981.html|title=Celtics Return to Glory|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celtics lost the 1982 Eastern Conference Finals to the 76ers, and along with it the possibility of a rematch with the Lakers. However, the final game of that series is memorable to the rivalry because Boston fans chanted for the 76ers, who were just about to eliminate their Celtics, to &quot;Beat L.A.!&quot;&lt;ref name=beatla&gt;{{cite news|title=Region revs up for an East-West rivalry reborn|quote=The intensity of the rivalry was encapsulated in the 1982 Eastern Conference Finals.

Retrieved January 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two teams finally had their long-awaited rematch in the [[1984 NBA Finals]],&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19831984.html|title=Celtics Win First Bird-Magic Finals Showdown|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grueling seven game series that had many memorable moments, including an impressive Laker performance in Game 3 that led Larry Bird to call his Celtic teammates &quot;sissies,&quot; the Kevin McHale takedown of Laker forward [[Kurt Rambis]] which led to increased physical aggression by both teams, the sweltering heat of the infamously un-airconditioned [[Boston Garden]] in Game 5, and [[Cedric Maxwell]]'s 24-point performance in Game 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt;  The Celtics went on to win in seven games, increasing their record of Finals' series victories against the Lakers to 8â0.&lt;ref name=AllTimeFinals/&gt;

The following year, the Lakers finally had their revenge, winning the [[1985 NBA Finals]] by taking Game 6 in Boston Garden, becoming the only visiting team to win an NBA championship in that arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19841985.html|title=Kareem, Lakers Conquer the Celtic Mystique|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss]] famously remarked that &quot;this has removed the most odious sentence in the English language. It can never again be said that 'the Lakers have never beaten the Celtics'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=mItTdhsRAbg#t=4m47s|title=1985 NBA Finals Game 6 Finish and Celebration (Old Version)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Celtics rebounded the following year to win the [[1986 NBA Finals]] against the Rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19851986.html|title=Frontcourt Vaults Celtics to Front of the Pack|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1987 NBA Finals]], the two teams met for a tie-breaker of their 1980s Finals matches, and the Lakers once again emerged victorious in six games, with the iconic image of Magic Johnson's junior sky hook.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987Finals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19861987.html|title=Magic Maneuvers Lakers Past Celtics|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series marked the end of an era for the Celtics. They did not reach the Finals again until 2008. The Lakers, meanwhile, went on to win the [[1988 NBA Finals]] against the [[Detroit Pistons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19871988.html|title=Lakers Capture the Elusive Repeat|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; before losing to the Pistons the following year in [[1989 NBA Finals|1989]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19881989.html|title=Waiting Game Ends for Impatient Pistons|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry between Bird, Johnson, and their teams contributed greatly to the success of the league during the decade; according to [[Bryant Gumbel]], &quot;Magic and Larry saved the NBA.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;macmullan&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Jackie MacMullan]]|title=Magic &amp; Bird: A Courtship of Rivals|publisher=[[HBO]]|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In every single NBA Finals series during the 1980s, either the Lakers or the Celtics were present.&lt;ref name=AllTimeFinals&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nba.com/history/finals/champions.html|title=NBA Finals: All-Time Champions|accessdate=June 13, 2011|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=NBA.com|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lull and rebuilding===
The Lakers-Celtics rivalry temporarily died down in the 1990s. Only the Lakers made an appearance in the NBA Finals that decade, losing the [[1991 NBA Finals]] to [[Michael Jordan]] and the [[Chicago Bulls]], the first championship in the Bulls' dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19901991.html|title=Bulls Finally Get That Championship Feeling|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would prove to be a defining moment of the NBA, a changing of the old guard as the Lakers and Celtics fell into mediocrity, while the Bulls won six titles lead by Jordan and coach [[Phil Jackson]], who would cement their respective reputations as the greatest player and coach in NBA history.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbah&quot;&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/players/jordan_bio.html Michael Jordan], nba.com/history.

However, the Lakers began the rebuilding process in 1996 by trading for [[Kobe Bryant]], who was drafted from high school that year by the [[Charlotte Hornets (NBA)|Charlotte Hornets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=SI Staff |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/news/2001/05/26/sayitaintso_lakers/ |title=Say It Ain't So (Transactions that broke our hearts) |publisher=CNN/[[Sports Illustrated]] |year=2001 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the Lakers signed [[Shaquille O'Neal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19960718&amp;slug=2339914 |title=NBA â Lakers Sign O'Neal Raise Ticket Prices |date=July 18, 1996 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=The Seattle Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1370&amp;dat=19960720&amp;id=8WUVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0goEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3531,3152523 |title=Shaq signs multi-million contract with LA Lakers |publisher=Manila Standard |date=July 20, 1996 |accessdate=December 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in 1998, the Celtics drafted [[Paul Pierce]], a native of [[Inglewood, California]] who had grown up as a Lakers fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2010/columns/story?page=beforetheywerestars-pierce-100615 |title=Once a Lakers Fan, Always a Celtic |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_1998.html|title=1998 NBA Draft|accessdate=|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=basketball-reference.com|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, in 1999, Phil Jackson joined the Lakers as head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2000.html |title=1999â00 Los Angeles Lakers Statistics |publisher=basketball-reference.com |accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers returned to prominence in the early 2000s. Under Jackson's guidance, and with O'Neal and Bryant leading the way, the Lakers won three straight championships in [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19992000.html|title=Shaq Makes Mark in New Millennium|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/20002001.html|title=Take Two for Tinseltown|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/20012002.html|title=A Sweeping Statement|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lakers' title in 2000 came against the [[Indiana Pacers]] who were coached by Celtic legend Larry Bird.  In 2002, the Celtics, with Paul Pierce and [[Antoine Walker]], made an impressive run for the Finals and the two teams narrowly missed each other.  However, the Celtics eventually fell in six games to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in that year's [[2002_NBA_Playoffs#Conference_finals_2|Eastern Conference Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2002.html 2002 NBA Playoffs], basketball-reference.com, accessed August 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers returned to the Finals in [[2004 NBA Finals|2004]] and suffered an embarrassing defeat at the hands of the [[Detroit Pistons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/finals2004/|title=Motown back at #1|accessdate=May 17, 2008|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, O'Neal was traded to the [[Miami Heat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Celtics likewise made little playoff progress after their near Finals run of 2002. In 2004, they hired head coach [[Doc Rivers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_20_105/ai_n6160431/ Doc Rivers goes back to the bench, hired to coach Boston Celtics], findarticles.com May 17, 2004, accessed May 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, they made blockbuster trades for [[List of NBA All Stars|All-Stars]] [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Ray Allen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/celtics/draft/press062807-ray-allen-trade.html Celtics Acquire Seven-Time All-Star Ray Allen from Sonics], nba.com/celtics, accessed July 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/celtics/news/press073107-garnett.html Celtics Acquire 10-Time All-Star Kevin Garnett], nba.com/celtics, accessed July 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who complemented career-long Celtics star Paul Pierce and emerging star [[Rajon Rondo]].

===Rivalry renewed===
With the addition of Allen and Garnett alongside Pierce to become the new &quot;Big Three,&quot; the Celtics returned to the top of the NBA in the 2007â2008 season by posting the best record in the league and reaching the Finals. The Lakers also returned to the Finals with the help of the mid-season acquisition of [[Pau Gasol]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GasolTrade&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=What were the Grizzlies Thinking? |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/columns/story?columnist=sheridan_chris&amp;id=3226776 |accessdate=2005-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the two teams finally met again in the [[2008 NBA Finals]].

The 2010 series had many memorable moments, including impressive performances from Bryant who led in points for six of the seven games, Ray Allen's Finals' record eight 3-pointers in Game 2, [[Derek Fisher]] carrying his team to victory and then crying in Game 3, a hard-fought Game 4 where [[Glen Davis (basketball)|Glen Davis]] screamed so loud he drooled while [[Nate Robinson]] rode on his back, a dominant Lakers performance in Game 6, and a close Game 7 that became the highest rated NBA game since Michael Jordan's second retirement in Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals.&lt;ref name=2010finals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20100617/BOSLAL/gameinfo.html|title=Revenge!

==Finals summaries==
===1959 NBA Finals===
{{main|1959 NBA Finals}}
This was the first NBA Finals series between the Lakers and the Celtics, and the only such meeting to occur while the Lakers were still in Minneapolis.  Minneapolis hadn't made an appearance in the Finals since winning four of the first five NBA Championships between 1950â1954, while Boston was making its third straight Finals appearance after winning in 1957 and losing in 1958.&lt;ref name=AllTimeFinals/&gt;

Minneapolis, led by rookie sensation [[Elgin Baylor]], made the Finals by defeating the defending Western Conference champion [[St. Louis Hawks]].  Boston would face a tough seven-game series against the [[Syracuse Nationals]] but would eventually emerge victorious, leading Celtic star [[Bob Cousy]] to predict that Boston would sweep Minneapolis.  Cousy would prove his prediction correct, leading his team with 51 total assists (still a record for a four-game NBA Finals series) to defeat the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4â0 sweep ever in the NBA Finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;summary1959&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Sports Reference, Inc | first= | title= 1958â59 Boston Celtics|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1959.html| date=July 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This marked the first of Boston's record eight straight titles.&lt;ref name=AllTimeFinals/&gt;

===1962 NBA Finals===
{{main|1962 NBA Finals}}
This was the first NBA Finals series between the Lakers and Celtics after the Lakers moved to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=1962Finals/&gt; 

Boston would win game one.  However, the Lakers would edge out for close victories in Game 2 and Game 3.  The Celtics would win Game 4 before the Lakers would come back and win another close victory in Game 5.&lt;ref name=1962Finals/&gt;  In the Game 5 victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baylor Scores 61 for Finals Record|url=http://www.nba.com/history/baylor61_moments.html|publisher=nba.com|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite fouling out of the game.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtics won Game 6 to set up the first Game 7 between the two franchises.

In Game 7, Laker [[Frank Selvy]], after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celtics Win Again...

===1963 NBA Finals===
{{main|1963 NBA Finals}}
The Lakers and Celtics would meet the following year in 1963.  The Celtics would again defeat the Lakers.&lt;ref name=AllTimeFinals/&gt;

The Celtics took the first two games, but the Lakers would blow the Celtics out with a 20-point differential in Game 3.  Although the Celtics would take Game 4, the Lakers would win Game 5 and fuel speculation that the young Lakers were about to surge past the older Celtics.  A defiant Bill Russel denied that any such thing was going to happen.  Sure enough, despite several close games, including the decisive game only having a three-point differential once again, the Celtics would only require six games to close out the Lakers this time.&lt;ref name=1963Finals/&gt;

This series would also be notable for its future implications in NBA telecasts.  When angry crowds showed up in Los Angeles to buy playoff tickets that were not available, the Lakers quieted the crowd by offering closed circuit TV viewing for $2.50 a head.  &quot;We were aware we were testing the future of pay television,&quot; Lakers general manager Lou Mohs told reporters. &lt;ref name=1963Finals/&gt;

===1965 NBA Finals===
{{main|1965 NBA Finals}}
The Celtics would make their ninth straight appearance in the NBA Finals and face the Lakers for the fourth time.&lt;ref name=AllTimeFinals/&gt; Celtics founder [[Walter A. Brown]] died during the season, and [[Red Auerbach]] led the team back to the Finals with his first Coach of the Year award.&lt;ref name=1965Finals/&gt;  The Celtics defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] to enter the Finals, marked by [[Johnny Most]]'s famous call of &quot;[[John_Havlicek|Havelick]] stole the ball!&quot;&lt;ref name=1965Finals/&gt;

Unlike their previous two encounters, the Celtics dominated the Lakers, who were playing without an injured Elgin Baylor, and only Game 2 had a close score.&lt;ref name=1965Finals/&gt;  The Celtics would win the series in Game 5 with a 129â96 victory over the Lakers.  This was the largest margin of victory in a deciding Finals game, and would not be broken until 2008, when the Celtics defeated the Lakers once again by a score of 131â92.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnsi-2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Celtics Seize First NBA Title In 22 Years|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/18/sports/main4188880.shtml|date=June 17, 2008|author=Associated Press|accessdate=2008-06-18|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1966 NBA Finals===
{{main|1966 NBA Finals}}
This was the Boston Celtics' eighth consecutive NBA Championship, a feat unrivaled in North American professional sports.&lt;ref name=8straight/&gt;  Despite finishing second in the division standings for the first time in a decade, Boston would return to the Finals for a record thirteenth straight time .&lt;ref name=1966Finals/&gt;

After the Los Angeles Lakers' comeback overtime win in Game 1, [[Red Auerbach]], who had challenged the entire league to topple the Celtics from their reign by announcing he would retire after 1965â1966 before the season had started (thus giving his detractors &quot;one last shot&quot; at him), announced Bill Russell as the Celtics coach for 1966â1967 and beyond, the first African-American coach in the NBA. Laker coach [[Fred Schaus]] privately fumed that Red's hiring had taken away all of the accolades his Lakers should have received following their tremendous Game 1 win.&lt;ref name=1966Finals/&gt;

The Celtics won the next three games and looked ready to close out L.A. in Game 5. However, behind the efforts of Elgin Baylor, [[Jerry West]], and [[Gail Goodrich]], the Lakers won the next two games, setting the stage for another classic Game 7 in the Boston Garden.&lt;ref name=1966Finals/&gt; The Celtics raced out to a huge lead, but down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments which fell just short.  The Celtics fended off the late Los Angeles rally to capture the NBA title and send Red Auerbach out a champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1966.html |title=Los Angeles Lakers 1965â66 Roster and Statistics|accessdate=November 8, 2010 |work= |publisher=basketball-reference.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celtics Claim 8th Straight Crown|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GGtWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=D-kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7006,4672069&amp;dq=los-angeles-lakers&amp;hl=en|accessdate=November 10, 2010|newspaper=The Spokesman Review|date=30 April 1966|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968 NBA Finals===
{{main|1968 NBA Finals}}

After they both missed the NBA Finals in 1967, the Lakers and the Celtics would meet again in 1968.  Boston's streak of 13 consecutive Finals appearances had been snapped in 1967 by the 76ers.  The 1968 Eastern Division Finals rematch between the Celtics and the 76ers was marred by the recent assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], but the decision was made not to delay the series.&lt;ref name=1968Finals/&gt;

The Lakers, led by new head coach [[Butch van Breda Kolff]], would actually root for the Celtics to win the series, thinking that Bill Russell would be easier to defeat than 76er [[Wilt Chamberlain]] (Chamberlain would become a Laker the following season).&lt;ref name=1968Finals/&gt;  The Lakers would get what they wished for and face the Celtics, but ultimately to the same result.  The Celtics won Game 1, and the two teams would alternate victories through Game 5.  Game 5 was notable for an impressive Lakers' comeback sending it into overtime, but the Celtics would ultimately win that game. In Game 6, the Celtics closed out the Lakers in convincing fashion with a 124â109 victory.&lt;ref name=1968Finals/&gt;

===1969 NBA Finals===
{{main|1969 NBA Finals}}
With Bill Russell and Sam Jones in their final season, and plagued with injuries, the Celtics struggled to make the NBA playoffs as the fourth and final seed in the Eastern Conference. They upset the 76ers in the first round and postponed New York's finals appearance for another year. Awaiting the Celtics were the powerful Los Angeles Lakers who had a nucleus of Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and newly acquired Wilt Chamberlain.&lt;ref name=1969Finals/&gt;

After losing the first two games in the Forum in L.A., no one thought Boston would even pull out a victory. However, they won Game 3 and a buzzer-beater by Sam Jones tied the series up at two games apiece. The home team won Games 5 and 6 which set up a dramatic seventh game. Before the game started, Laker's owner [[Jack Kent Cooke]] placed flyers in every seat stating &quot;When, not if, the Lakers win the title, balloons will be released from the raftors, the USC marching band will play &quot;[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]&quot; and broadcaster Chick Hearn will interview Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain in that order.&quot;&lt;ref name=heller&gt;{{cite news |last=Heller |first=Dick |title=Cookin' with Cook |date=June 10, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/10/dick-heller-cooke-got-celtics-cookin/print/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xJS5jqkQ |archivedate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the game, the Celtics circulated in their locker room a memo about the Lakers' celebration plans.&lt;ref name=lazenby&gt;{{cite book |last=Lazenby |first=Roland |authorlink=Roland Lazenby |title=The show: The Inside Story of the Spectacular Los Angeles Lakers in the Words of Those Who Lived It |year=2006 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]] |location=[[New York, New York]] |isbn=9780071430340 |pages=121â122 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HiH8z6EmSIsC&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;vq=balloons&amp;dq=the%20show%20roland%20lazenby&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=March 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell noted the giant net hanging from the ceiling during pregame warmups and said to West, &quot;Those [expletive deleted] balloons are staying up there.&quot;&lt;ref name=heller/&gt; West was furious at the balloons for providing the Celtics extra motivation.&lt;ref name=lazenby/&gt;

Boston, who had not won a game in the Forum all season, played tough through the first half and would keep the game close, with a score of 60â60. Remarkably, Boston would pull away and entered the fourth quarter up by 18. It seemed to be over when Lakers center Wilt Chamberlain was injured and replaced by reserve [[Mel Counts]]. The Celtics, however, would begin to show their age when they began missing shots and turning the ball over and Laker Jerry West pulled L.A. to within one. Despite having numerous opportunities, the Lakers couldn't get over the hump and Don Nelson would make an incredible foul-line jump-shot which bounced off the back iron and fell in. During this, another battle was heating up off the court between Jack Kent Cooke and Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff. Chamberlain was pleading for Breda Kolff to put him back in, but he refused. Cooke then came down to personally order the defiant coach to insert Wilt, but to no avail. This would prove critical as the Celtics held on and triumphed 108â106.&lt;ref name=1969Finals/&gt;

The first ever Finals MVP award was given to Jerry West, despite being on the losing team (thus far the only time this has happened).&lt;ref name=finalsmvp/&gt;  Despite this, West was inconsolable.&lt;ref name=1969Finals/&gt;  In a show of good sportsmanship, Bill Russell held West's hand and John Havlicek said: &quot;I love you, Jerry!&quot;&lt;ref name=taylor336_353&gt;{{cite book|last=Cherry|first=Robert|title=[[Wilt: Larger than Life]]|year=2004|publisher=Triumph Books|location=Chicago|isbn=1-57243-672-7}}, pp. 336â353.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984 NBA Finals===
{{main|1984 NBA Finals}}
By virtue of a 62â20 record, the Celtics had homecourt advantage over the Lakers who finished the regular season with a 54â28 mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1984.html|title=1983-84 NBA Season Summary|work=basketball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtics defeated the Lakers four games to three.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt;

The Lakers opened the series with a 115â109 victory at the [[Boston Garden]]. In Game 2, the Lakers led 113â111 with 18 seconds left when [[Gerald Henderson]] stole a [[James Worthy]] pass to score a game tying layup and the Celtics eventually prevailed in overtime 124â121.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt; In Game 3, the Lakers raced to an easy 137â104 victory as [[Magic Johnson]] dished out 21 assists.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt; After the game, [[Larry Bird]] said his team played like &quot;sissies&quot; in an attempt to light a fire under his teammates.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt; In Game 4, the Lakers had a five point game lead with less than a minute to play, but made several execution errors as the Celtics tied the game and then came away with a 129â125 victory in overtime. The game was also marked by Celtic forward [[Kevin McHale]]'s takedown of Laker forward [[Kurt Rambis]] on a breakaway layup which triggered the physical aspect of the rivalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt;  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar would go after [[Larry Bird]] later on in the third quarter, and 1981 Finals MVP [[Cedric Maxwell]] further antagonized the Lakers by following a missed [[James Worthy]] free throw by crossing the lane with his hands around his own neck, symbolizing that Worthy was &quot;choking&quot; under pressure.  In Game 5, the Celtics took a 3â2 series lead as [[Larry Bird]] scored 34 points. The game was known as the &quot;Heat Game&quot;, as it was played under 97-degree Fahrenheit heat, and without any air conditioning at the infamous [[Boston Garden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt; In Game 6, the Lakers evened the series with a 119â108 victory. In the game, the Lakers answered the Celtics rough tactics when Laker forward James Worthy shoved [[Cedric Maxwell]] into a basket support. After the game, a Laker fan threw a beer at Celtics guard [[M.L. Carr]] as he left the floor, causing him to label the series &quot;all-out-war.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt; In Game 7, the Celtics were led by [[Cedric Maxwell]], who had 24 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists as they came away with a 111â102 victory. In the game the Lakers rallied from a 14-point-deficit to three points down with one minute remaining, when Maxwell knocked the ball away from [[Magic Johnson]]. [[Dennis Johnson]] responded by sinking two free throws to seal the Celtics' victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Finals&quot;/&gt; [[Larry Bird]] was named MVP of the series.&lt;ref name=finalsmvp/&gt;

{{main|1985 NBA Finals}}
The Celtics, looking to repeat as NBA Champions, had homecourt advantage for the second year in a row as they finished the regular season with a 63â19 record while the Lakers compiled a 62â20 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1985.html|title=1984-85 NBA Season Summary|work=basketball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time, the Finals went to a 2â3â2 format with games one and two in Boston while the next three games were in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;/&gt;

The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Celtics four games to two. Game 1 became known as the &quot;[[Memorial Day Massacre]]&quot; as the Celtics soundly beat the Lakers 148â114.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;/&gt;  Celtic reserve forward [[Scott Wedman]] made all 11 out of 11 field goal attempts.  The Lakers responded in Game 2 with a 109â102 victory as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] had 30 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists, and three blocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;/&gt; [[Michael Cooper]] had 22 points, making 8 out of 9 field goals attempted.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;/&gt;  In Game 3, the Celtics had a 48â38 lead in the second quarter before the Lakers, led by [[James Worthy]], took a 65â59 lead at halftime and then pulled away in the second half to come away with a 136â111 victory.  Worthy had 29 points while Abdul-Jabbar had 26 points and 14 rebounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;/&gt;  The Celtics tied the series in Game 4, 107â105 as [[Dennis Johnson]] hit a jumper at the buzzer.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;/&gt; In Game 5, the Lakers raced out to a 64â51 lead and stretched it to 89â72 before the Celtics cut the deficit to 101â97 with six minutes remaining. However [[Magic Johnson]] made three shots while Abdul-Jabbar added four more shots, and the Lakers came away with a 120â111 victory to take a 3â2 series lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;/&gt;  Abdul-Jabbar led the Lakers with 36 points. The series shifted to Boston with only one full day off for both teams.  In Game 6, the Lakers were led by Abdul-Jabbar who scored 29 points as the Lakers defeated the Celtics 111â100. Magic had 15 points, 14 assists, and 10 rebounds; Worthy had 28 points on 11 for 15 shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Finals&quot;/&gt;  It was the only time a visiting team claimed an NBA championship in Boston Garden. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was named MVP of the series, making him the oldest player (38 years, 1 month, 24 days) ever to win the MVP of an NBA Finals series.&lt;ref name=finalsmvp/&gt;

===1987 NBA Finals===
[[Image:1987 NBA Finals Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|left|Los Angeles Lakers Magic Johnson and Boston Celtics Dennis Johnson 1987 NBA Finals]]''
{{main|1987 NBA Finals}}
After being eliminated in the Western Conference Finals [[1985-86 NBA season|a year earlier]], the Lakers returned to the NBA Finals and were awarded homecourt advantage as they accumulated a 65â17 record while the Celtics finished the season with a 59â23 record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1987.html|title=1986-87 NBA Season Summary|work=basketball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Celtics four games to two. In Game 1, the Los Angeles Lakers came away with a 126â113 victory. [[Magic Johnson]] had 29 points, 13 assists, and 8 rebounds, while [[James Worthy]] had 33 points, 10 assists, and 9 rebounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987Finals&quot;/&gt;  In Game 2, the Lakers took a 2â0 series lead with a 141â122 victory.   Magic had 22 points and 20 assists, while [[Michael Cooper]] made six three point shots, then a record for most three pointers made in a single NBA Finals game.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987Finals&quot;/&gt;  In Game 3, the Celtics posted a 109â103 win, led by [[Larry Bird]], who had 30 points and 12 rebounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987Finals&quot;/&gt; In Game 4, the Celtics had a 16-point lead in the third quarter before the Lakers stormed back into the game. Bird had hit a three point bomb with 12 seconds remaining to give the Celtics the lead, however, with two seconds remaining, [[Magic Johnson]] sank a &quot;junior sky hook&quot; to give the Lakers a 107â106 lead, then Bird missed a 20-foot jumper as time expired, allowing Los Angeles to gain a three games to one lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987Finals&quot;/&gt; In Game 5, the Celtics prevented the Lakers from celebrating in the [[Boston Garden]] by coming away with a 123â108 win. Boston guard [[Danny Ainge]] made 5 out of 6 three-pointers attempted, including a 45-footer as the first half expired.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987Finals&quot;/&gt;  In Game 6, the Lakers trailed the Celtics 56â51 at halftime, but thanks to an 18â2 run, they regained control of the game with a 30â12 third quarter to cruise to a 106â93 victory and their fourth championship in the decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987Finals&quot;/&gt;  [[Magic Johnson]] was named unanimous MVP of the series, averaging 26.2 points, 13.0 assists, 8.0 rebounds, and 2.3 steals, leading the Lakers in all four categories.&lt;ref name=finalsmvp/&gt;

===2008 NBA Finals===
[[Image:OpeningTipoffGame2-2008NBAFinals.jpg|thumb|left|In 2008, the Lakers and the Celtics met in the NBA Finals for the first time in 21 years]]
{{main|2008 NBA Finals}}

This was the first time the Celtics made the Finals since 1987, while the Lakers' last appearance had been in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllTimeFinals&quot;/&gt;

The Celtics' 66â16 record gave them home court advantage over Los Angeles (57â25).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2008.html|title=2007-08 NBA Season Summary|work=basketball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They won the first two games at TD Garden.  Game 1 featured Paul Pierce leaving the court with an injury, but later returning to raucous cheers.  The Lakers won Game 3.  They also looked to be in control of Game 4, holding their ground for most of the third quarter, leading by as many as 24 points. However, the Celtics went on a 21â3 run to end the third quarter, closing the deficit to only two points (73â71). With 4:07 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Celtics took their first lead in the game when Celtics' reserve Eddie House made an 18-foot (5.5 m) jumper. With House's shot, the Celtics were in the lead for good. The Celtics' victory in Game 4 was the largest comeback in the NBA Finals since 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/25129400/|title=Furious comeback gives Celtics 3â1 lead|work=NBCSports.com|author=Associated Press|date=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers would win Game 5, sealing their victory with a Kobe Bryant steal of the ball in Pierce's possession.  However, the Celtics would close out the series in Game 6 with a dominating 131â92 win.  The 39-point margin of victory was the largest ever in an NBA championship-clinching game, breaking the old record of 33, also set by the Celtics over the Lakers in Game Five of the [[1965 NBA Finals]], 129â96.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnsi-2008&quot;/&gt;  Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.&lt;ref name=finalsmvp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finalsmvps.html|title=Finals MVP|work=NBA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the Celtics' 17th championship, their first since 1986, extending their record for most NBA championships won by a single team. Their win in Game 6 was also a sense of relief. Entering the game, they set a record of most playoff games played in one season, with 26, breaking the previous record of 25 set by both the [[1993-94 New York Knicks season|1994 New York Knicks]], whom Celtics Coach [[Doc Rivers]] played for, and the [[2004â05 Detroit Pistons season|2005 Detroit Pistons]], both of whom lost in their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in {{nbafy|1994}}, Pistons in {{nbafy|2005}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnsi-2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MostGames&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E5D6113AF934A25755C0A96E9C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|title=Celtics Remain Mindful Of a Missed Opportunity|date=June 17, 2008|first=Howard|last=Beck|newspaper=The New York Times|page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for the 1994 Knicks, the first round was a best-of-five. They also set an NBA record for most playoff games ever needed to win a championship, with 26, surpassing the previous record of 24 by the Lakers in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnsi-2008&quot;/&gt;

===2010 NBA Finals===
{{main|2010 NBA Finals}}
This was the third straight year in which the L.A. Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals.  Much of both rosters had been kept intact since the teams last meeting in 2008 and the Celtics' veterans Paul Pierce, [[Kevin Garnett]], [[Ray Allen]], and [[Rasheed Wallace]] looked to add to their championship rÃ©sumÃ©s, while [[Kobe Bryant]] and the Lakers looked to even the score against the Celtics. The Lakers were the defending champions, having beaten the [[Orlando Magic]] 4â1 in the [[2009 NBA Finals]].

This was the first NBA Finals to go the full seven games since {{nbafy|2005}}, and only the fourth since the NBA switched the Finals to a 2â3â2 format in {{nbafy|1985}}.

The Lakers won Game 1 a 102â89, led by Kobe Bryant's 30-point performance and sealed with his 3-pointer with 3.6 second left.  However, Ray Allen would respond in Game 2 by scoring 32-points and sinking a record eight 3-pointers, leading the Celtics to victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20100606/BOSLAL/gameinfo.html#nbaGIlive |title=Allen shoots lights out to take homecourt from Lakers |first=Bryan |last=Chu |work=NBA.com |work=2010-06-07 |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game 3 returned to Boston, where the Lakers took a 2â1 series lead, again led by Bryant but with strong support from Derek Fisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20100608/LALBOS/gameinfo.html#nbaGIlive |title=Fisher's offensive heroics the difference for Lakers |first=Bryan |last=Chu |work=NBA.com |work=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Game 4 would prove to be a close and hard-fought game, with the Lakers up by two at the end of the third quarter.  However, Boston's bench would prove to be the deciding factor, outscoring the Lakers 13â2 for nearly half the quarter.  A memorable moment from this game was Glenn Davis screaming so loud after a basket that he drooled, while Nate Robinson rode on his back.&lt;ref name=&quot;tie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Baby, Celtics bench provide spark as Celtics tie Finals|work=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN|date=2010-06-10|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300610002|accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtics won the game and evened the series.

Despite an impressive 38-point performance from Bryant in Game 5, the Celtics would win 92â86 and take a 3â2 lead heading back to L.A.  However, the Lakers opened up a massive lead in Game 6, peaking at 27. The Lakers' bench had outscored Boston's bench 24â0 entering the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300615013 ESPN Game 6 Recap]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lakers would win the game 89â67 and set up an epic Game 7.  Both Kendrick Perkins of Boston and Andrew Bynum of Los Angeles were injured in this game.  However, while Perkins was ruled out because of his injury, Bynum was cleared to play in Game 7.&lt;ref name=injury&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/boston/nba/news/story?id=5294006 |title=Perkins sidelined with knee injury |last1=Forsberg |first1=Chris |date=June 17, 2010 |work=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the fifth Game 7 between the Lakers and Celtics. Boston had won all previous Game 7 match-ups between the two teams. Kobe Bryant exhibited difficulties for much of the game, shooting only 6-for-24 from the field.  However, he would score 10 of his game-high 24 points in the fourth quarter.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sekou.

The Celtics were forced to foul Sasha VujaÄiÄ, he went to the line and made both free throws to give the Lakers a definitive 83â79 lead.  Rondo would miss his final 3-pointer and the Lakers won Game 7 against the Celtics for the first time in franchise history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=300617013|title=Bryant, Artest rally Lakers to 16th championship |date=2010-06-17|work=ESPN|accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game 7 was the second most-watched game in NBA history, with 28.2 million viewers (No. 1 being Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/2010/news/06/22/finals.nielsen.ap/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpt2|title=Game 7 of Finals pulls in 28.2 million viewers|date=2010-06-22|work=NBA|accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game 7 was watched by an average audience of 1.1 million viewers on TSN, making it the largest Canadian audience ever recorded for an NBA game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nba/story/?id=325046 |title=Lakers Championship Sets NBA Broadcast Record For Canada |date=June 18, 2010 |work=[[The Sports Network|TSN]] |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first time since 2002 that a team has won back-to-back championships; that team was also the Lakers.

Kobe Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second straight year.&lt;ref name=finalsmvp/&gt;

==&quot;Beat L.A&quot;==
One of the lasting effects on the LakersâCeltics rivalry was the usage of the famous &quot;Beat L.A.!!!&quot; chant, sung by fans in opposing arenas whenever a Los Angeles-based team plays in their home venue. The chant originated during Game 7 of the [[1981â82 NBA season|1982 Eastern Conference Championships]] at [[Boston Garden]] when the Boston fans urged the victorious [[Philadelphia 76ers]] to &quot;Beat L.A.&quot;&lt;ref name=beatla/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=lpY0m6cEKhw|title=NBA on CBS 1982 Celtics/Sixers Game 7 Finish (&quot;Beat LA&quot;)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kerby |first=Trey |title=Everything you could possibly want to know about the NBA Finals
