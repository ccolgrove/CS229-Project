The '''Modern Whig Party''' is a [[United States political party]] whose stated intention is to be a &quot;party for the rest of us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;modernwhig.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernwhig.info |title=The Modern Whig Party |publisher=Modernwhig.info |date= |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Modern Whig Party describes itself as a mainstream, middle-of-the-road grassroots movement that caters to those voters who believe in various Republican issues but also believe in various other Democratic issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;modernwhig.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albuquerque Journal Article by Sean Olson, &quot;Revived Whigs,&quot; published July 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

Founded by [[Iraq war|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|Afghanistan]] veterans, the party claims some 30,000 supporters, many of them affiliated with the American military.&lt;ref&gt; On Lincolnâs 200th birthday the &quot;Modern Whig&quot; Party makes a comeback http://www.richmond-dailynews.com/news.php?id=2674&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Modern Whigs Gain Political Momentum http://www.mvtelegraph.com/index.php/news/1732-Modern-Whigs-Gain-Political-Momentum-in-N.M..html&lt;/ref&gt;

The general platform of the Modern Whig Party relates to fiscal responsibility, strong national defense, and social progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theotherpaper.com/articles/2008/09/25/front/doc48daacb5a71fc951019104.txt |title=&gt; Archives &gt; Front &gt; UA sophomore leads Whigs in Columbus |publisher=The Other Paper |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan |first=Jack |url=http://www.emissourian.com/site/news.cfm?dept_id=544418&amp;newsid=20240322 |title=Washington Missouri - Whig Party Up and Running in State |publisher=Emissourian.com |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to ''[[The News &amp; Observer]]'': &quot;The national Modern Whig Party, as it calls itself, was started in the most unlikely of locationsâthe deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan by U.S. troops.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsobserver.com&quot;/&gt; The Modern Whig Party was organized as a grassroots movement in the beginning of 2008. The [[Florida Whig Party]] was created two years earlier with a similar goal at the state level but is not affiliated in any way.&lt;ref name=&quot;election.dos.state.fl.us&quot;&gt;http://election.dos.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/ComHtml.exe?account=45020 Florida Department of State website confirming Florida Whig Party was ballot approved in 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;&quot;Modern Whig Party has Appeal to Some Troops: No Candidates Yet, but with Moderate Stance, it's Starting to Catch On&quot; as published in the Marine Corps Times, Army Times and Air Force Times newspapers in June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among the national Modern Whig Party's founding members were military veterans who had served in Afghanistan and Iraq and become dissatisfied with the deep ideological divide between the Republican and Democratic parties.&lt;ref&gt; WTFK 107.1 FM &quot;Viewpoints with Lockwood Phillips http://www.wtkf107.com/images/002VPWEBCAST%20%20DAILY%20HR%202.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; Other media outlets have touted the Modern Whig Party's moderate platform and its viable appeal during a time of ideological fragmentation within the Republican and Democratic parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.easternecho.com/index.php/article/2009/12/modern_whig_partymoderates_new_ally_&lt;/ref&gt;

The grassroots movement of the Whigs has a national headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] and an executive committee.&lt;ref&gt;WKOB Eyewitness News 4http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S1065236.shtml?cat=504&lt;/ref&gt; The Modern Whig Party claims about 20,000 members nationally, although that number is known to primarily count those who register on the party's web site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot;&gt;http://www.slate.com/id/2238557/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See Whig register from their site, Wikipedia prevented direct link&lt;/ref&gt; Various Modern Whig chapters, such as in California, also gather and tally members through their state registrations. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/ccrov/pdf/2009/july/09112da.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;The party currently has a national executive committee composed of individuals in Texas, Missouri, New York, and Georgia.

The Modern Whig Party announced their first electoral victory when one of its members, Ken Belcher&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcbelcher.com/index.html |title=Ken Belcher website |publisher=Kcbelcher.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, won election as Constable of [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], [[Alabama]] on the Democratic ticket (Belcher cited difficulty with third parties qualifying to appear on ballots in the state and affirmed his Modern Whig affiliation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2008/11/a-new-party-with-an-old-name-elects-its-first-candidate-for-office/ |title=A new party with an old name elects its first candidate for office |publisher=Independent Political Report |date= |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first authentic electoral test, Gene L. Baldassari sought a seat in the [[New Jersey Assembly]], representing its Fourteenth District, in the November 2, 2009 [[New Jersey elections, 2009|general election]].  He received 738 votes, for just over 0.6 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njelections.org/2009results/2009-unofficial-gen-assembly-tallies-110309-g.pdf]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the election of November 4, 2008, a push began to attract moderate/[[conservative Democrats]] and members of the Republican Party who felt disenchanted with both the GOP's failings and its perception as moving further to the right.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Republicans are Bald, Put on your Whigs&quot; by Kyle Munzenrieder on Nov. 7, 2008 in Miami New Times&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, those seeking a non-ideological political movement reportedly began joining the Modern Whig Party as soon as the election results came in.&lt;ref&gt; See Miami New Times article&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12&amp;ndash;13, 2009, the Modern Whig Party held the first national leadership council meeting in Washington DC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate&quot; /&gt; The party's bylaws and charter were made public shortly after, with the document listing its official name as the Modern Whig Party of the United States of America and being approved by a national council.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2009/12/modern-whig-party-charter-and-bylaws-posted/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Modern Whig Party endorsed [[Jeffrey Vanke]], who ran as an independent in the race for Virginia's 6th electoral district against incumbent Republican [[Bob Goodlatte]], winning just under 13% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.voterinfo.sbe.virginia.gov/election/DATA/2010/EB24720D-F5C6-4880-8DC5-12AE4D0C3772/official/6_s.shtml/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media coverage ===
In the Spring of 2010, Time Magazine rated the Modern Whig Party along with the [[U.S. Marijuana Party]], the [[United States Pirate Party|Pirate Party]], the [[Tea Party movement]], and the [[Alaskan Independence Party|American Secessionists]] as one of the &quot;top 10 most popular alternative political movements worldwide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1975807_1975805_1976014,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Alternative Political Movements | date=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in one newspaper referred to the Modern Whig Party as the &quot;fastest-growing mainstream political movement in the nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntsvillevoice.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=679:iraqafghanistan-veterans-revive-lincolns-longtime-party&amp;catid=85:local-news&amp;Itemid=26 ]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other opinion columns have been highly favorable toward the party.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsobserver.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/politics/story/1501272.html ]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political platform==

The MWP follows a six-tenet philosophy that the party does not specifically associate with [[centrism]]. It is instead denoted as &quot;Modern Whig philosophy&quot; and &quot;Methodology over Ideology&quot; by the Modern Whigs themselves&lt;ref&gt;[http://linux104.mysite4now.net/nightsoft/www/whig/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1 California Modern Whig Party, Who Are Modern Whigs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernwhigparty.blogspot.com/ The Modern Whig Party blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illinoiswhig.org/ Home (Illinois Modern Whig Party), WHO ARE MODERN WHIGS?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0X1LZf6e8U&amp;feature=fvsr Here comes Modern Whigs!, YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; and also by others, as the movement takes stands on issues across the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;[[n:Wikinews interviews Mike Lebowitz, Chairman of the Modern Whig Party|Wikinews interviews Mike Lebowitz, Chairman of the Modern Whig Party, Wikinews, the free news source you can write!, Monday, October 13, 2008]], third question&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2009/02/modern-whig-party-update/ Modern Whig Party update, February 11th, 2009, Independent Political Report], third paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

The six tenets of the Modern Whig philosophy are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernwhig.forumotion.net/modern-whig-party-discussion-f1/inventing-new-political-philosophy-t296.htm]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Fiscal responsibility]] &amp;ndash; &quot;The Modern Whig philosophy is to empower the states with the resources to handle their unique affairs.&quot;
*[[North American energy independence|Energy independence]] &amp;ndash; &quot;Reduce dependence on foreign oil by developing practical sources of alternative energy. This will have the simultaneous effect of changing the national security dynamic.&quot;
*[[Education in the United States|Education]]/[[Scientific progress|Scientific advancement]] &amp;ndash; &quot;Increased public and private emphasis on fields such as space, oceanic, medical and nanotechnology. Also, providing common-sense solutions to enhance our educational system from pre-school to university-level studies.&quot;
*[[States' rights]] &amp;ndash; &quot;Each state can determine its course of action based on local values and unique needs.&quot;
*[[Civil Liberties|Social progress]]ion &amp;ndash; &quot;Government should refrain from legislating morality.&quot;
*[[Veterans affairs|Veterans' affairs]] &amp;ndash; &quot;Vigilant advocacy relating to the medical, financial, and overall well-being of our military families and veterans.&quot;

There are also self-described &quot;General Principles&quot; of Modern Whig philosophy that are included along with the tenets: &quot;This includes general principles of fiscal responsibility, strong national defense and bold social progression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modernwhig.org/oldindex.html#about&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logo==
For its logo, the Modern Whig Party uses an owl, the symbol of the original Whig Party. As with the logos for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], a red, white, and blue color scheme is used, but with different meaning.  Reportedly, the blue represents Democrats and the red, Republicans; the two colors are divided by a white band and four white stars. The party believes that the United States' future lies in &quot;meeting in the middle,&quot; thus the placement of the stars in the middle of the owl.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Top 10 USA Political Party Logos&quot; by Logo Design Works http://www.logodesignworks.com/blog/top-10-usa-political-party-logos/&lt;/ref&gt;
