==Overview==
Occupy Seattle began with a protest at the [[Henry M. Jackson Federal Building|Federal Building]] in downtown Seattle on September 26, 2011 and camping at Westlake Park on October 1. The camp moved to Seattle Central Community College (SCCC) on October 29, 2011 and the nightly General Assembly moved to SCCC on November 4, 2011. Some facilities and camping are also located at Seattle City Hall.

According to a news report, the City of Seattle has spent an extra $104,869 as of October 14, 2011 in response to the protest for overtime pay for police and parks &amp; recreation personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;OvertimePay&quot;&gt;Thompson, Lynn (October 19, 2011.)

Occupy Seattle protesters and police briefly clashed in protests sparked by [[JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co|Chase]] CEO [[Jamie Dimon]]'s visit to town. Five protesters were arrested for occupying the bank for over an hour (linking together via chain and pieces of PVC and facing out from the tellers). In the events that followed, a dozen or more demonstrators sat in front of the police van to prevent it from moving and were eventually pulled away; numerous protesters were [[Pepper spray|pepper-sprayed]], two police officers and multiple protesters sustained minor injuries, and at least three further protesters were arrested. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/11/occupy-seattle-chase-dimon.html|title=Occupy Seattle swoops in around JPMorgan Chase executive|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=November 3, 2011|accessdate=November 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15th a march commenced from the Seattle Central Community College campus to Belltown.  At one point during the march a 17-year-old female swung a stick at an officer.  After officers moved in to arrest the female the officers were hindered in their efforts, after issuing an order to disperse the officers deployed pepper spray to move subjects away from them so they could arrest the female suspect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spdblotter.seattle.gov/2011/11/15/demonstration-downtown-six-arrested/]&lt;/ref&gt;  Police were [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDu0HKyzQIU filmed spraying the crowd] of people with pepper spray.
