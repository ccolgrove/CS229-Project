'''Zenwalk''' is a [[Linux distribution]] founded by Jean-Philippe Guillemin. It was originally based on [[Slackware]]. Since its creation, the distribution has become very different from Slackware in most regards while still maintaining compatibility with its binary packages. Zenwalk aims to be a modern and multi-purpose Linux distribution by focusing on Internet applications, multimedia and programming tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Futtrup_05&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=An introduction to Zenwalk 1.2 | author=Claus Futtrup | url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT3996176017.html | date=2005-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Zenwalk comes with many specialized tools, designed for beginner through advanced users as it offers system configuration via both graphical and command-line operations.

== History ==
Zenwalk was originally called Minislack up to version 1.1, taking its current name with version 1.2 released 2005-08-12. Originally using [[KDE]] as its desktop environment, Zenwalk now uses [[Xfce]] as of version 0.3, although [[GNOME]] and KDE packages have always been available separately.

== Aims ==

The Zenwalk Project aims to create a lightweight Linux distribution (through using only one application per task on the release [[ISO image]]), optimization for a specific [[processor architecture]] to increase execution speed, and introduces a comprehensive package management system with dependency resolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Tiny Zenwalk 5.0 packs a big punch | author=Mayank Sharma | url=http://www.linux.com/feature/126526 | date=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community ==
The Zenwalk Project has a forum that allows users and developers alike to post their issues, concerns and praise.

The newest official [[Software package (installation)|software packages]] are published in the ''-snapshot'' tree. When sufficient testing and debugging have been completed, a package is moved to the ''-current'' tree, where most users can download software to update their systems.

[[Image:Zenpanel.jpg|left|thumb|Zenpanel, a system configuration utility.]]

The community is also encouraged to take part in [[software development|software package development]], since the official software pool is considered limiting by some users.  This allows third-party software to be made compatible with the Zenwalk directory structure, as well as improved interoperability with the rest of the distribution.

== Package management ==

[[Image:Xnetpkg-screenshot.jpg|thumb|Zenwalk's netpkg in its GUI guise, xnetpkg.]]

Zenwalk uses the netpkg [[package management]] tool. It is developed in-house, and it provides the main functionalities of the [[apt-get]] variety of package managers. It uses Slackware's .tgz package format, but adds dependency resolution capabilities. The system uses meta files to provide dependency information, as well as package description during the install process. This convenience is only available to the official Zenwalk mirrors listed in the netpkg configuration file, ''netpkg.conf''. In addition to the original ''netpkg'' command line interface, ''xnetpkg'' provides a GUI frontend with similar capabilities.

Additionally, Zenwalk is compatible with Slackware package management tools such as [[slapt-get]] and its frontends, and have similar functionality as that of netpkg.

As of Zenwalk 4.6, package compatibility with Slackware is still maintained.  Slackware packages may be used to substitute Zenwalk packages where necessary.  Additional package availability can be found at [http://www.linuxpackages.net LinuxPackages.net].

== Supported architectures ==
Zenwalk Linux is built and optimized primarily for the [[i686]] architecture, although it supports [[i486]] computers as well.

== Project versions ==

There are five main versions of Zenwalk as of Zenwalk 7.0 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenwalk.org Official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Zenwalk Standard''' is a distribution aimed at mainstream desktop and development use.  Designed to be a stand-alone operating system, it installs to the hard drive by way of a [[ncurses]]-based installer. It includes all of the officially released software packages that are deemed most useful by the Zenwalk community. The default install also includes development packages like [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]], and some proprietary media packages (such as Adobe Flash Player) and drivers in order to provide a full featured default install. The default desktop environment is [[Xfce]].

*'''Zenwalk Core''' is a Zenwalk system built with customization in mind.  Released with no X Window System binaries, its aim is to allow a skilled user to build a system fit for his or her needs.  The project's lead developer is Emmanuel Bailleul.

*'''ZenLive''' is a Zenwalk system built on a [[live distro|Live CD]] design.  ZenLive follows the progress made by the full Zenwalk system closely, thus mirroring the version number, and attempts to stay true to the original distribution's goals.  In addition, it includes all of the necessary libraries and applications to develop and compile software, a particularly rare feature in Live CD distributions.  Project members include Pierrick Le Brun, creator, Mauricio Tricoli, project lead, and Michael Verret, artwork.

*'''Zenwalk Gnome''' has [[GNOME]] as the default desktop environment.

*'''Zenwalk Openbox''' is supplied with [[Openbox]] as stand-alone window manager. It is a very lightweight version of the operating system. It does not follow LXDE in its choice of software. It still uses Thunar file manager over PC-Man which is standard on LXDE-based systems such as Lubuntu.

== Derivatives ==
There are currently three known Zenwalk-based distributions:
*[http://www.tdisecurity.com/tools.html Arudius], a live CD distribution for information assurance with tools for penetration testing and vulnerability analysis. Discontinued.
*[[SLAMPP]], intended to be used as a home server.
*[http://linux.blogs.ie/ Zencafe], a distribution designed for [[internet cafes]].

==Live USB==
A [[Live USB]] of Zenwalk Linux for versions up to 5.2 can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;.
