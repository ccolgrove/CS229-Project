The 2009 [[Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football]] team represented the [[University of Delaware]] in the 2009â2010 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS) college football season. They played their home games at [[Delaware Stadium]] in [[Newark, Delaware]]. Their record of 6â5 (4â4 CAA) was an improvement upon 2008 in which the team had its worst season by losses in its 117 year football history.

==Recruiting==

The biggest coup for the University of Delaware in the off-season was the addition of quarterback [[Pat Devlin (American football)|Pat Devlin]], a transfer from [[Penn State]] and former [[All-America#High_school_sports|high school All-American]] out of [[Downingtown High School|Downingtown East High School]]. In high school Devlin is Pennsylvania's all time leading passer with 8,162 yards. He was named the 2005 Pennsylvania Class AAA Player of the Year and the Gatorade Pennsylvania Player of the Year and earned a No. 4 ranking among prep quarterbacks nationally by Scout.com. He also was a named a ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]'' magazine All-American and played in the prestigious [[Big 33 Football Classic]]. Delaware also signed 20 recruits including four defensive linemen, four offensive linemen, three defensive backs, three linebackers, two runningbacks, two wide receivers, one quarterback, and one tight end. The recruits hail from seven states, including five from Pennsylvania, four each from New Jersey and Florida, three from Maryland, two from Virginia, and one each from Delaware and New York. The 2009 class matched the all-time high total of 20 signed by Coach Keeler in 2006.

Delaware squared off against #1 Richmond on Saturday September 12 in front of 20,000 plus fans, with the Spiders coming off a big win over the Duke Blue Devils. Delaware's defense opened the scoring by forcing a punt which resulted in a muffed snap that went over the Richmond punters head in the end zone. The punter kicked the ball out of the back of the end zone to prevent a Delaware touchdown, and UD took a 2â0 lead. On the ensuing drive the Blue Hens managed to get into field goal range and made the score 5â0. After another UD field goal put them up 8â0, Richmond drove down the field with the half winding down and scored a touchdown to cut the lead to 8â7. After trading defensive stops, UD forced a fumble in the red zone and the offense punched it in for touchdown putting Delaware up 15â7. Richmond was able to drive down the field in the 4th quarter for a touchdown and went for a 2 point conversion to tie it, but the conversion failed and Delaware led 15â13. Richmond again managed to get down the field and the Delaware defense again held them to a field goal, putting Richmond ahead 16â15. After defensive stops by both teams, the Richmond punter muffed a punt that failed to cross the 50. With the excellent field position, Pat Devlin completed a pair of passes to get Delaware to the 12 yard line with under 2 minutes to play. After three straight rushing plays to run time off the clock, UD set up for the field goal with 32 seconds to play. The Richmond defense however was able to block the 29 yard field goal attempt to preserve a close 16â15 win in a hard fought CAA game. The blocked field goal made ESPN's Top Ten Highlights for Saturday as the #2 play of the day.

In the first regular season meeting between the two schools in the new [[Route 1 Rivalry]], over 20,000 fans were in attendance for the noon kickoff of the intrastate game. The first quarter saw UD score a touchdown on their opening drive, a 1-yard rush by quarterback Pat Devlin at the 7:41 mark of the first quarter. The drive had initially stalled and kicker John Striefsky had missed a 42-yard field goal attempt wide left, however, the Delaware State Hornets were called for a personal foul on the play, giving UD 15 yards and a first down. The Hornets answered by driving down the field themselves, but had to settle for a 42-yard field goal by kicker Riley Flickinger, a career long. After trading punts several times and a 44-yard field goal attempt by Delaware State missed wide right, the Blue Hens were able to move the ball to the 1 yard line with 1.5 seconds left in the first half. The Blue Hens decided to go for the touchdown and the Hornets made a goal line stop as time expired in the first half with the aid of a questionable call by the officials. In the second half the offenses again moved the ball up and down the field but were still unable to punch it in for a score, with Delaware State reaching the Blue Hens 18 yard line before an interception. Late in the third Delaware took over the ball at their own 30 yard line after stopping the Hornets on downs and executed a 4 play 70-yard drive for a touchdown that again ended with a Pat Devlin 1-yard run to extend the lead to 14â3. Delaware State again moved into Blue Hens territory for the third straight time, but again turned the ball over as a fumble by Jason Randall on the Delaware 25 yard line was recovered by UD and returned to the 41. The Hens then drove down the field on five plays ending with a Pat Devlin 17-yard touchdown pass to freshman Rob Jones, increasing the lead to 21â7.  Delaware State attempted to answer back, driving down the field into scoring range only to turn the ball over again after a Flickinger's 35-yard field goal attempt was blocked. Delaware State finally got a break, however, as on the ensuing drive Pat Devlin's pass went off the hands of a receiver and was intercepted by free safety Jerome Strums who raced 71 yards down the field for the Hornets first touchdown, cutting into the lead 21â10. After an excellent kickoff return, UD needed just 3 plays to pick up 23 yards for another touchdown as Leon Jackson rushed for a 3-yard touchdown making it 27â10 with 3:36 left in the game. Delaware State was able to muster one final drive as Delaware State quarterback Anthony Glaud kept the ball himself for a 1-yard rushing touchdown with 31 seconds left in the game to complete the scoring at 27â21.

Quarterback Pat Devlin was sacked eight times and intercepted twice as the #16 Blue Hens playoff chances were dealt a major blow in a rainy homecoming game. The James Madison Dukes came into Delaware Stadium with a 1â5 record and had not won in Newark since 1994. The only scoring in the first half for either team came on a 34-yard field goal early in the second quarter by Delaware's John Striefsky. Early in the first quarter the Blue Hens had attempted a fake field goal from the James Madison 9-yard line, but were stopped short of the first down. The Dukes took a 7â3 lead on the first drive of the third quarter when quarterback Justin Thorpe rushed into the endzone on a 12-yard option keeper to close a six-play, 75-yard drive. Striefsky kicked a 31-yard field goal to bring Delaware back within 7â6, however JMU answered back, with Thorpe throwing 7 yards to tight end Charlie Newman with 3:18 left in the third quarter for the touchdown. A 53-yard pass to Rockeed McCarter set up the touchdown, however the Dukes missed the extra point and led 13â6. James Madison drove 83 yards on 14 plays to score on Jamal Sullivan's 3-yard rush with under 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter to stretch the lead to 20â6. The Dukes defense then held off the Blue Hens offense and an intentional safety by the Dukes completed the scoring for a 20â8 loss for the Blue Hens.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200991031016&lt;/ref&gt;
