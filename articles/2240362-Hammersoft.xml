{{nihongo|'''''Panchira'''''|ãã³ãã©}} is an expression used by Japanese women to warn each other that their underwear is visible; the term carries risquÃ© connotations similar to the phrase &quot;your [[Slip (clothing)|slip]] is showing&quot; in English usage. The word is a [[portmanteau]] of {{nihongo|&quot;[[panty]]&quot;|ãã³ãã£ã¼|pantÄ«}} and ''chira'', the [[Japanese sound symbolism]] representing a glance or glimpse.&lt;ref name=forensic&gt;{{Cite book |title=Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices |first=Anil |last=Aggrawal |page=134 |publisher=CRC Press |year=2008 |isbn=9-7814-2004-3082}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=You Know You've Been in Japan Too Long... |first=Bill |last=Mutranowski |pages=109&amp;120 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |year=2003 |isbn=9-7808-0483-3806}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from the more general term &quot;upskirt&quot; in that '''''pan'''''chira specifies the presence of underpants (the absence of which would more accurately be described as ãã¼ãã³; [[No-pan kissa|nÅpan]]).

In [[anime]] and [[manga]], ''panchira'' usually refers to a panty-shot, a visual convention used extensively by Japanese artists and animators since the early sixties. According to Japanese sources, the convention probably started with [[Machiko Hasegawa]]'s popular comic strip [[Sazae-san]], whose character designs for [[Sazae-san#Isono_and_Fuguta_family|Wakame Isono]]  incorporated an improbably brief hemline.&lt;ref&gt;Akihara, Koji, and Takekuma, Kentaro. ''Even a Monkey Can Draw Manga.'' VIZ Media LLC; 1st edition, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was later transferred to animation when [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s ''[[Astro Boy]]'' was adapted for television in 1963. Confined mainly to harmless children's series throughout the remainder of the decade, panchira took on more overtly [[fetish]]istic elements during the early seventies.&lt;ref&gt;Koji and Takekuma, ''Even a Monkey Can Draw Manga.''&lt;/ref&gt; From that point on, ''panchira'' became linked with sexual humor. It is particularly prevalent in so-called [[shÅnen manga]].&lt;ref&gt;Millegan, Kris. &quot;Sex in Manga&quot;, ''Comics Journal,'' 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Kogaru1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Panchira in Japanese anime.]]
As noted below, the development of panchira in [[Japanese popular culture]] has been analyzed by a number of American and Japanese writers. Many observers link the phenonemon to the Westernization of Japan following [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Botting, Geoff et al. ''Tabloid Tokyo: 101 Tales of Sex, Crime and the Bizarre from Japan's Wild Weeklies.'' Kodansha Inc (2005) p. 16. It should be noted, however, that Botting also confirms that a  &quot;lingerie subculture&quot; had been established during the early [[ShÅwa period|Showa era]]. Largely based around fetishistic photography, this early variant was considered socially unacceptable due the return to traditional Japanese values that took place throughout the 1930s. Strong anti-Western sentiment hastened the subculture's disappearance during the interwar period, as anything suggestive of Western sexual attitudes was regarded as degenerate.&lt;/ref&gt; During the occupation, fashions, ideas, and media previously unavailable were accessed by the local population, leading to a slight relaxing of earlier taboos. Western-style clothing (including women's underwear) gained popularity in the post-war period, reinforced through numerous media outlets - magazines, newspapers, films, journals, and [[comics]].

At least one Japanese source traces the beginnings of panchira to the release of [[The Seven Year Itch]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;ShÅichi, Inoue. ãã³ããè¦ããã: ç¾æ¥å¿ã®ç¾ä»£å² (&quot;The Underpants are visible: the history of being ashamed&quot;). Asahi shimbun, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The media coverage surrounding [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s iconic scene fueled the emerging Japanese craze. According to architectural historian Shoichi Inoue, the practice of &quot;scoring&quot; a glimpse up young women's skirts became extremely popular around this period;  &quot;Magazines of the time have (sic) articles telling the best places where panties could be viewed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Botting et al, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, panchira had spread to the mainstream comic industry, as fledgling [[Mangaka|manga artists]] such as [[Go Nagai]] began exploring sexual imagery in boy's comics ([[shÅnen manga]]).&lt;ref&gt;Millegan, Kris. '&quot;Sex in Manga&quot;, ''Comics Journal,'' 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; It is significant to note the emergence of adult themes in what was then considered a juvenile medium. Millegan argues that the [[ecchi]] genre of the 1970s rose to fill a void left by the decline of [[Osaka]]'s lending library network:&lt;ref&gt;Millegan, '&quot;Sex in Manga&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Japanese comics did not seriously begin exploring erotic themes until the sixties, with the collapse of the pay-library system (largely brought about by the unexpected success of cheap comic magazines such as [[Kodansha|Kodansha Publishing]]'s [[Weekly ShÅnen Magazine|ShÅnen Magazine]]). Artists working for the pay-library system had already pioneered the depiction of graphic violence, and had proudly declared that they were drawing [[gekiga]] (&quot;drama pictures&quot;), not mere comics. In the search for realism (and readers), it was inevitable that sex would soon make an appearance.
&lt;br&gt;
As the Japanese comics market diversified, sex spread beyond the gekiga to just about every conceivable niche in the marketplace. The gekiga continued their realistic and often violent depictions, but the other major divisions in the manga world developed their own approach. Boy's comics began to explore &quot;cute&quot; sex, mainly consisting of panchira (&quot;panty shots&quot;) and girls in showers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Academic perspectives==

Although there are few academic studies dealing ''specifically'' with panchira, the subject has been touched on by several writers under the broader context of the [[male gaze]]. From the Western perspective, panchira is characterized by the sexual stereotyping inherent in patriarchal culture.  [[Anne Allison]] makes reference to the convention in ''Permitted and Prohibited Desires,'' theorizing that the exposure of women's (or girls') underwear in ero-manga is constructed as an &quot;immobilizing glance&quot;, in the sense that panchira is usually presented as a tableau in which the (female) object of desire is 'petrified' by the male gaze.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, Anne. ''Permitted and Prohibited Desires: Mothers, Comics, and Censorship in Japan'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

She further postulates that this 'glance' is generally depicted as transgressive: the audience is permitted a glimpse of the female body (partially) unclothed, but it is always framed as a forbidden action. This prohibitive tableau permeates the entire genre, as virtually all ero-manga follows the same formula of trangression and immobilization.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, ''Permitted and Prohibited Desires&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Anne Cooper-Chen states that the endlessly repeated image &quot;of a male gazing at a female's panty clad crotch&quot; represent an archetypal manga panel.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper-Chen, Anne: &quot;The Dominant Trope: Sex, Violence and Hierarchy in Japanese Comics for Men&quot;, in ''Comics and Ideology,'' McAllister et al, 2001, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; She supports Allison's view that women/girls portrayed in their underwear (or naked) is a common motif in Japanese comics, and is most frequently accompanied by a masculine &quot;viewer&quot; whose voyeuristic presence is indicative of the male gaze. However, in contrast to Allison, Cooper-Chen's observations are not confined only to the ''ero'' market. Rather, she argues that the dominant trope of frustrated desire and sexual violence may be extended to the manga mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper-Chen, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more generalized perspective is provided by Mio Bryce's analysis of classroom imagery in Japanese comics. Using [[Go Nagai]]'s [[Harenchi Gakuen]] as a prime example, Bryce notes that Nagai's storylines challenged long-standing social values by ridiculing traditional authority figures. Teachers in Nagai's manga were portrayed as deviants and perverts, engaging in various forms of aggressively voyeuristic behavior towards their female students. In this regard, panchira was employed as a form of social satire, voicing a general mistrust of authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Mio: ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'School'&lt;/nowiki&gt; in Japanese Children's lives depicted in Manga'', p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In much the same vein, Bouissou states that Harenchi Gakuen 'smashed' the Japanese taboo against eroticism in children's comics, indicative of the rapidly changing cultural attitudes endemic to late 60s Japan. Although the eroticism was confined mainly to panchira and soft-core cartoon nudity, the manga's impact was felt all across the country. As Bouissou points out, the publication of Harenchi Gakuen sparked a &quot;nationwide boom of ''skato meguri'' (to roll up the girl's skirt)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bouissou, Jean-Marie: &quot;Manga goes Global.&quot; Paper presented at the University of Sheffield, March, 1998 (p.17)&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Abel's work on the unmentionables of Japanese film argues that the cultivation of the underwear fetish through roman poruno films{{Clarify|What is a &quot;roman poruno film&quot;?|date=July 2011}} after a police seizure may have first been evidence of covering up, but rapidly became a signifier of that which could never be attained. Abel's psychoanalytical approach then calls for the use of &quot;panchira&quot; as a term for eroticization of the invisible.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan E. Abel, &quot;Packaging Desires: The Unmentionables of Japanese Film,â Perversion and Modern Japan: Psychoanalysis, Literature, Culture edited by Keith Vincent and Nina Cornyetz, Routledge, 2009. 272-307.&lt;/ref&gt;
