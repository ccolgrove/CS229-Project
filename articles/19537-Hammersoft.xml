{{VG Role-playing}}

A '''MUD''' (originally '''Multi-User Dungeon''', with later variants '''Multi-User Dimension''' and '''Multi-User Domain'''),{{R|bartle-acronym|hahn-acronym}} pronounced {{IPA-en|ËmÊd|}}, is a [[multiplayer]] [[Time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time]] [[virtual world]], with the term usually referring to [[Text-based (computing)|text-based]] instances of these.  MUDs combine elements of [[role-playing games]], [[hack and slash]], [[player versus player]], [[interactive fiction]], and [[online chat]]. Players can read or view descriptions of rooms, objects, other players, [[non-player characters]], and actions performed in the virtual world. Players typically interact with each other and the world by typing commands that resemble a [[natural language]].

Traditional MUDs implement a [[role-playing video game]] set in a [[fantasy]] world populated by [[List of species in fantasy fiction|fictional races and monsters]], with players choosing [[character class|classes]] in order to gain specific skills or powers.  The object of this sort of game is to slay [[monster]]s, explore a fantasy world, complete quests, go on adventures, create a story by [[roleplaying]], and advance the created character. Many MUDs were fashioned around the dice-rolling rules of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' series of games.

Such fantasy settings for MUDs are common, while many others have [[science fiction]] settings or are based on popular books, movies, animations, periods of history, and so on.  Not all MUDs are games; some are designed for [[#Educational MUDs|educational]] purposes, while others are purely [[#Talkers|chat environments]], and the [[Turing completeness|flexible nature]] of many MUD servers leads to their occasional use in areas ranging from [[computer science]] research to [[geoinformatics]] to [[medical informatics]] to [[analytical chemistry]].{{R|hansen|boring|cruickshank|schaefer}}  MUDs have attracted the interest of academic scholars from many fields, including [[communication]]s, [[sociology]], [[law]], and [[economics]].{{R|turkle|grimmelmann|castronova-mmorpg}}  At one time, there was interest from the United States military in using them for teleconferencing.{{R|shefski}}

Most MUDs are run as hobbies and are free to players; some may accept donations or allow players to [[Virtual Asset Sales|purchase virtual items]], while others charge a monthly subscription fee. MUDs can be accessed via standard [[telnet]] clients, or specialized [[MUD client]]s which are designed to improve the user experience. Numerous games are listed at various web portals, such as [[The Mud Connector]].

The history of modern [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs)]] like ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', and related [[virtual world]] genres such as the social virtual worlds exemplified by ''[[Second Life]]'', traces directly back to the MUD genre.{{R|castronova-mmorpg|stuart-mmorpg}}  Indeed, before the invention of the term MMORPG, games of this style were simply called [[#Graphical MUDs|graphical MUD]]s.  A number of influential MMORPG designers began as [[:Category:MUD developers|MUD developers]] and/or players (such as [[Raph Koster]], [[Brad McQuaid]],{{R|guru3d}} [[Matt Firor]], and [[Brian Green (game developer)|Brian Green]]{{R|greenmud}}) or were involved with early MUDs (like [[Mark Jacobs (video game designer)|Mark Jacobs]] and [[J. Todd Coleman]]).

==Origins==
[[File:ADVENT -- Will Crowther's original version.png|thumb|[[Will Crowther]]'s ''Adventure'']]
[[File:MUDscreen.jpg|thumb|You haven't lived until you've died in MUD. &amp;mdash; The ''[[MUD1]]'' Slogan]]

''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'', created in 1975 by [[Will Crowther]] on a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-10]] computer, was the first widely used [[adventure game]]. The game was significantly expanded in 1976 by [[Don Woods]]. Also called ''Adventure'', it contained many D&amp;D features and references, including a computer controlled [[dungeon master]].{{R|montfort|livinginternet}}

Inspired by ''Adventure'', a group of students at [[MIT]] wrote a game called ''[[Zork]]'' in the summer of 1977 for the PDP-10 minicomputer which became quite popular on the [[ARPANET]]. ''Zork'' was [[ported]] under the name ''Dungeon'' to [[FORTRAN]] by a programmer working at [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] in 1978.{{R|zork}}

In 1978 [[Roy Trubshaw]], a student at [[Essex University]] in the UK, started working on a multi-user adventure game in the MACRO-10 assembly language for a DEC PDP-10. He named the game [[MUD1|''MUD'']] (''Multi-User Dungeon''), in tribute to the ''Dungeon'' variant of ''Zork'', which Trubshaw had greatly enjoyed playing.{{R|wired-dragon}}  Trubshaw converted MUD to [[BCPL]] (the predecessor of [[C (Programming Language)|C]]), before handing over development to [[Richard Bartle]], a fellow student at Essex University, in 1980.{{R|bartle-history-email|shahrominemud1|cuciz}}

[[MUD1|''MUD'']], better known as ''Essex MUD'' and ''MUD1'' in later years, ran on the Essex University network until late 1987,{{R|bartle-mud1-1987}} becoming the first Internet multiplayer online role-playing game in 1980, when Essex University connected its internal network to [[ARPANet]].{{R|dogarpa}}  The game revolved around gaining points till one achieved the wizard rank, giving the player immortality and certain powers over mortals. The game became more widely accessible when a guest account was set up that allowed users on [[JANET]] (a British academic [[X.25]] computer network) to connect on weekends and between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM on weekdays.{{R|wisner1}}  ''MUD1'' was reportedly closed down when Richard Bartle licensed ''[[MUD1]]'' to [[CompuServe]], and was getting pressure from them to close ''Essex MUD''. This left ''[[MIST (MUD)|MIST]]'', a derivative of ''MUD1'' with similar gameplay, as the only remaining MUD running on the Essex University network, becoming one of the first of its kind to attain broad popularity. ''MIST'' ran until the machine that hosted it, a [[PDP-10]], was superseded in early 1991.{{R|escape-from-the-dungeon}}

During the Christmas of 1985, Neil Newell, an avid ''MUD1'' player, started programming his own MUD called ''SHADES'' because ''MUD1'' was closed down during the holidays. Starting out as a hobby, ''SHADES'' became accessible in the UK as a commercial MUD via British Telecom's [[Prestel]] and [[Micronet800|Micronet]] networks.{{R|shades}}  A scandal on ''SHADES'' led to the closure of [[Micronet800|Micronet]], as described in [[Indra Sinha]]'s net-memoir, ''The Cybergypsies''.{{R|sinha}}

In 1985 Pip Cordrey gathered some people on a BBS he ran to create a ''MUD1'' clone that would run on a home computer. The [[tolkienesque]] MUD went live in 1986 and was named ''MirrorWorld''.{{R|bartle-mudreport1}}

1985 also saw the creation of ''Gods'' by [[Ben Laurie]], a ''MUD1'' clone that included [[online creation]] in its endgame. ''Gods'' became a commercial MUD in 1988.{{R|bartle-mudreport2}}

In 1985 CompuNet started a project named ''Multi-User Galaxy Game'' as a Science Fiction alternative to ''MUD1'' which ran on their system at the time. When one of the two programmers left CompuNet, the remaining programmer, Alan Lenton, decided to rewrite the game from scratch and named it [[Federation II]] (at the time no Federation I existed). The MUD was officially launched in 1989.{{R|bartle-mudreport3}}  Federation II was later picked up by AOL, where it became known simply as &quot;Federation: Adult Space Fantasy&quot;.  Federation later left AOL to run on its own after AOL began offering unlimited service.

In 1978, around the same time Roy Trubshaw wrote MUD, Alan E. Klietz wrote a game called ''Milieu'' using Multi-[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] on a [[CDC Cyber]] 6600 series [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] which was operated by the [[Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium]].{{R|wisner2}}  Klietz ported ''Milieu'' to an [[IBM XT]] in 1983, naming the new port ''[[Scepter of Goth]]''. ''Scepter'' supported 10 to 16 simultaneous users, typically connecting in by modem. It was one of the first commercial MUDs; franchises were sold to a number of locations. ''Scepter'' was first owned and run by GamBit (of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]), founded by Bob Alberti. GamBit's assets were later sold to [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay Productions]]. Interplay eventually went bankrupt.{{R|klietz}}

In 1984, Mark Peterson wrote ''The Realm of Angmar'', beginning as a [[clone (computer and video games)|clone]] of ''Scepter of Goth''. In 1994, Peterson rewrote ''The Realm of Angmar'', adapting it to [[MS-DOS]] (the basis for many dial-in [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] systems), and renamed it ''[[Swords of Chaos]]''. For a few years this was a very popular form of MUD, hosted on a number of BBS systems, until widespread Internet access eliminated most BBSes. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In 1984, [[Mark Jacobs (video game designer)|Mark Jacobs]] created and deployed a commercial gaming site, ''Gamers World''. The site featured two games coded and designed by Jacobs, a MUD called ''Aradath'' (which was later renamed, upgraded and ported to ''[[GEnie]]'' as ''[[Dragon's Gate]]'') and a [[4X game|4X]] science-fiction game called ''Galaxy'', which was also ported to ''[[GEnie]]''.  At its peak, the site had about 100 monthly subscribers to both ''Aradath'' and ''Galaxy''.  GEnie was shut down in the late 1980s, although ''[[Dragon's Gate]]'' was later brought to ''[[America Online]]'' before it was finally released on its own.  Dragon's Gate was closed on February 10, 2007.{{R|dragonsgate}}

In the summer of 1980 [[University of Virginia]] classmates John Taylor and [[Kelton Flinn]] wrote ''Dungeons of Kesmai'', a six player game inspired by ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' which used [[Roguelike]] [[ASCII]] graphics. They founded the [[Kesmai]] company in 1982 and in 1985 an enhanced version of ''Dungeons of Kesmai'', ''[[Island of Kesmai]]'', was launched on [[CompuServe]]. Later, its 2-D graphical descendant ''[[Legends of Kesmai]]'' was launched on [[AOL]] in 1996. The games were retired commercially in 2000.{{R|kennelly|dogkesmai|gallear}}

The popularity of MUDs of the Essex University tradition escalated in the USA during the late 1980s when affordable [[personal computers]] with 300 to 2400 bit/s [[modems]] enabled role-players to log into multi-line [[Bulletin Board Systems]] and [[online service providers]] such as [[CompuServe]]. During this time it was sometimes said that MUD stands for &quot;Multi Undergraduate Destroyer&quot; due to their popularity among college students and the amount of time devoted to them.{{R|mudsociety}}

==Spread==
===AberMUD===
{{main|AberMUD}}
The first popular MUD [[codebase]] was AberMUD, written in 1987 by [[Alan Cox]], named after the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]].  Alan Cox had played the original [[University of Essex]] MUD, and the gameplay was heavily influenced by it.{{R|carroll}}  AberMUD was initially written in [[B (programming language)|B]] for a Honeywell L66 mainframe under GCOS3/TSS. In late 1988 it was ported to [[C (programming language)|C]], which enabled it to spread rapidly to many [[Unix]] platforms upon its release in 1989. AberMUD's popularity resulted in several inspired works, the most notable of which were [[TinyMUD]], [[LPMud]], and [[DikuMUD]].{{R|bartle-abermud}}

===TinyMUD===
{{main|TinyMUD}}
''Monster'' was a multi-user adventure game created by [[Richard Skrenta]] for the [[VAX]] and written in VMS Pascal. It was publicly released in November 1988.{{R|monster-release|monster-home}}  ''Monster'' was disk-based and modifications to the game were immediate. ''Monster'' pioneered the approach of allowing players to [[online creation|build the game world]], setting new puzzles or creating dungeons for other players to explore.{{R|monster-introduction}}  Monster, which comprised about 60,000 lines of code, had a lot of features which appeared to be designed to allow ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' to work in it.  Though there never were many network-accessible Monster servers, it inspired [[James Aspnes]] to create a stripped down version of ''Monster'' which he called TinyMUD.{{R|mud-info}}

TinyMUD, written in C and released in late 1989, spawned [[TinyMUD family tree|a number of descendants]], including [[TinyMUCK]] and [[TinyMUSH]]. TinyMUCK version 2 contained a full programming language named [[MUF (programming language)|MUF]] (Multi-User [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]), while [[MUSH]] greatly expanded the command interface. To distance itself from the combat-oriented traditional MUDs it was said that the &quot;D&quot; in TinyMUD stood for Multi-User &quot;Domain&quot; or &quot;Dimension&quot;; this, along with the eventual popularity of acronyms other than MUD (such as MUCK, MUSH, MUSE, and so on) for this kind of server, led to the eventual adoption of the term [[MU*]] to refer to the [[TinyMUD family tree|TinyMUD family]].{{R|bartle-acronym|hahn-acronym}} UberMUD, UnterMUD, and [[MOO]] were inspired by TinyMUD but are not direct descendants.{{R|burka-mudline-tinymud}}

===LPMud===
[[File:Genesis LPMud Login.png|thumb|right|The login screen from ''[[Genesis LPMud|Genesis]]'', the first LPMud]]
{{main|LPMud}}
In 1989 LPMud was developed by [[Lars PensjÃ¶]] (hence the '''LP''' in LPMud). PensjÃ¶ had been an avid player of [[TinyMUD]] and [[AberMUD]] and wanted to create a world with the flexibility of TinyMUD and the gameplay of AberMUD. In order to accomplish this he wrote what is nowadays known as a [[virtual machine]], which he called the LPMud driver, that ran the C-like [[LPC (programming language)|LPC programming language]] used to create the game world.{{R|dog-lpmud}}  PensjÃ¶'s interest in LPMud eventually waned and development was carried on by others such as [[JÃ¶rn Rennecke|JÃ¶rn &quot;Amylaar&quot; Rennecke]], [[Felix Croes|Felix &quot;Dworkin&quot; Croes]], Tim &quot;Beek&quot; Hollebeek and Lars DÃ¼ning.  During the early 1990s, LPMud was one of the most popular MUD codebases.{{R|livinginternet-lpmud}}  [[LPMud family tree|Descendants of the original LPMud]] include [[MudOS]], [[Dworkin's Game Driver|DGD]], [[SWLPC (programming language)|SWLPC]], [[FluffOS]], and [[Pike (programming language)|the Pike programming language]], the latter the work of long-time LPMud developer [[Fredrik HÃ¼binette|Fredrik &quot;Profezzorn&quot; HÃ¼binette]].

===DikuMUD===
{{main|DikuMUD}}
In 1990, the release of DikuMUD, which was inspired by AberMUD, led to a virtual explosion of [[hack and slash]] MUDs based upon its code.  DikuMUD inspired [[DikuMUD family tree|numerous derivative codebases]], including [[CircleMUD]], [[Merc (MUD)|Merc]], [[ROM (MUD)|ROM]], [[SMAUG]], and [[GodWars]].  The original Diku team comprised Sebastian Hammer, Tom Madsen, Katja Nyboe, Michael Seifert, and Hans Henrik Staerfeldt.  DikuMUD had a key influence on the early evolution of the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] genre, with ''[[EverQuest]]'' (created by avid DikuMUD player [[Brad McQuaid]]{{R|guru3d}}) displaying such Diku-like gameplay that [[Verant]] developers were made to issue a sworn statement that no actual DikuMUD code was incorporated.{{R|verant-diku-persons|verant-diku-server}}

===Simutronics===
{{main|Simutronics}}
In 1987 David Whatley, having previously played ''[[Scepter of Goth]]'' and ''[[Island of Kesmai]]'', founded Simutronics with Tom and Susan Zelinski.{{R|cambron-dunin}}  In the same year they demonstrated a prototype of ''[[GemStone IV|GemStone]]'' to [[GEnie]].  After a short-lived instance of ''GemStone II'', ''GemStone III'' was officially launched in February 1990.  ''GemStone III'' became available on [[AOL]] in September 1995, followed by the release of ''[[DragonRealms]]'' in February 1996.  By the end of 1997 ''GemStone III'' and ''DragonRealms'' had become the first and second most played games on AOL.{{R|dunin-simutronics}}

==Gameplay==
The typical MUD will describe to you the room or area you are standing in, listing the objects, players and NPCs in the area, as well as all of the exits.  To carry out a task the player would enter a text command such as '''take apple''' or '''attack dragon'''.  Movement around the game environment is generally accomplished by entering the direction (or an abbreviation of it) in which the player wishes to move, for example typing '''north''' or just '''n''' would cause the player to exit the current area via the path to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;movement&quot;&gt;Basic movement commands: [http://evermore.de/index.php?id=87 The Lands of Evermore Manual]&lt;/ref&gt;

MUD clients often contain functions which make certain tasks within a MUD easier to carry out, for example commands buttons which you can click in order to move in a particular direction or to pick up an item.  There are also tools available which add hotkey-activated macros to telnet and MUD clients giving the player the ability to move around the MUD using the arrow keys on their keyboard for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;mud-assistant&quot;&gt;Tools to simplify the playing of MUD games: [http://mudassist.wyesoft.com/ WyeSoft MUD Assistant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
While there have been many variations in overall focus, [[gameplay]] and features in MUDs, some distinct sub-groups have formed that can be used to help categorize different [[game mechanic]]s, [[video game genres|game genres]] and [[non-game]] uses.

===Hack and Slash MUDs===
{{See|Hack and slash}}
Perhaps the most common approach to game design in MUDs is to loosely emulate the structure of a ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' campaign focused more on fighting and advancement than role-playing.  When these MUDs restrict [[player versus player|player-killing]] in favor of [[player versus environment]] conflict and [[Quest (gaming)|questing]], they are labeled '''Hack and Slash MUDs'''.  This may be considered particularly appropriate since, due to the room-based nature of traditional MUDs, ranged combat is typically difficult to implement, resulting in most MUDs equipping characters mainly with close-combat weapons.  This style of game was also historically referred to within the MUD genre as &quot;adventure games&quot;, but video gaming as a whole has developed a meaning of &quot;[[adventure game]]&quot; that is greatly at odds with this usage.

===Player versus player MUDs===
[[File:Genocide screenshot.png|thumb|right|A screenshot from ''[[Genocide (online game)|Genocide]]'' showing its War Complex]]
{{See|Player versus player}}
Most MUDs restrict player versus player combat, often abbreviated as PK (Player Killing).  This is accomplished through hard coded restrictions and various forms of social intervention.  MUDs without these restrictions are commonly known as '''PK MUDs'''.  Taking this a step further are MUDs devoted ''solely'' to this sort of conflict, called '''pure PK''' MUDs, the first of which was ''[[Genocide (online game)|Genocide]]'' in 1992.{{R|reesegeno}}  ''Genocide''{{'s}} ideas were influential in the evolution of [[player versus player]] online gaming.{{R|shahromine-geno}}

===Roleplaying MUDs===
{{See|Role-playing game}}
'''Roleplaying MUDs''', generally abbreviated as '''RP MUDs''', encourage or enforce that players act out the role of their playing characters at all times.  Some RP MUDs provide an immersive gaming environment, while others only provide a virtual world with no game elements.  MUDs where roleplay is enforced and the game world is heavily computer-modeled are sometimes known as '''Roleplay Intensive MUDs''', or '''RPIMUDs'''.{{R|korchmar}}

===Social MUDs===
{{See|MMOSG}}
'''Social MUDs''' de-emphasize game elements in favor of an environment designed primarily for socializing.  They are differentiated from talkers by retaining elements beyond online chat, typically [[online creation]] as a community activity and some element of [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] &amp;mdash; often such MUDs have broadly defined contingents of socializers and roleplayers.  Server software in the [[TinyMUD family tree|TinyMUD family]], or [[MU*]], is traditionally used to implement social MUDs.

===Talkers===
{{Main|Talker}}
A less-known MUD variant is the '''[[talker]]''', a variety of [[online chat]] environment typically based on server software like [[ew-too]] or [[NUTS (talker)|NUTS]].  Most of the early Internet talkers were [[LPMud]]s with the majority of the complex game machinery stripped away, leaving just the communication commands.  The first Internet talker was ''[[Cat Chat]]'' in 1990.  Avid users of talkers are called [[spod]]s.

===Educational MUDs===
{{See|:Category:Educational MUDs}}
Taking advantage of the flexibility of MUD server software, some MUDs are designed for educational purposes rather than gaming or chat.  ''[[MicroMUSE]]'' is considered by some to have been the first educational MUD,{{R|burka-mudline-micromuse}} but it can be argued that its evolution into this role was not complete until 1994,{{R|micromuse-charter}} which would make the first of many educational [[MOO]]s, ''[[Diversity University]]'' in 1993, also the first educational MUD.  The MUD medium lends itself naturally to [[Constructionism (learning theory)|constructionist learning]] pedagogical approaches. The Mud Institute (TMI) was an LPMud opened in February 1992 as a gathering place for people interested in developing LPMud and teaching LPC after it became clear that Lars PensjÃ¶ had lost interest in the project. TMI focussed on both the LPMud driver and library, the driver evolving into MudOS, the TMI Mudlib was never officially released, but was influential in the development of other libraries.

===Graphical MUDs===
[[Image:Yserbiusfight.JPG|right|thumb|A combat in ''[[The Shadow of Yserbius]]'', an early graphical MUD]]
{{see|MMORPG|:Category:Graphical MUDs}}
A '''graphical MUD''' is a MUD that uses [[computer graphics]] to represent parts of the virtual world and its visitors.{{R|bartle-textgraph}}  A prominent early graphical MUD was ''[[Habitat (video game)|Habitat]]'', written by [[Randy Farmer]] and [[Chip Morningstar]] for [[Lucasfilm]] in 1985.{{R|castronova-habitat}}  Graphical MUDs require players to download a special client and the game's artwork.  They range from simply enhancing the [[user interface]] to simulating 3D worlds with visual spatial relationships and customized [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] appearances.

Games such as ''[[Meridian 59]]'', ''[[EverQuest]]'', ''[[Ultima Online]]'' and ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]'' were routinely called graphical MUDs in their earlier years.{{R|meridian59-mud|bmcquaid|dog-daoc-mud|king}}  ''[[RuneScape]]'' was actually originally intended to be a ''text-based'' MUD, but graphics were added very early in development.{{R|runescapeqa|warcryrunescape}}  However, with the increase in computing power and Internet connectivity during the late nineties, and the shift of online gaming to the mass market, the term &quot;graphical MUD&quot; fell out of favor, being replaced by [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG, Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game]], a term coined by [[Richard Garriott]] in 1997.{{R|mmorpg-coinage}}

==Psychology and engagement==
[[Sherry Turkle]] developed a theory that the constant use (and in many cases, overuse) of MUDs allows users to develop different personalities in their environments.  She uses examples, dating back to the text-based MUDs of the mid-1990s, showing college students who simultaneously live different lives through characters in separate MUDs, up to three at a time, all while doing schoolwork.  The students claimed that it was a way to &quot;shut off&quot; their own lives for a while and become part of another reality.  Turkle claims that this could present a psychological problem of identity for today's youths.{{R|turkle}}

&quot;[[A Story About A Tree]]&quot; is a short essay written by [[Raph Koster]] regarding the death of a ''[[LegendMUD]]'' player named Karyn, raising the subject of inter-human relationships in virtual worlds.

Observations of MUD-play show [[Bartle Test|styles of play]] that can be roughly categorized. Achievers focus on concrete measurements of success such as [[Experience point|experience points, levels]], and wealth; Explorers investigate every nook and cranny of the game, and evaluate different [[Game mechanics|game mechanical]] options; Socializers devote most of their energy to interacting with other players; and then there are Killers who focus on interacting negatively with other players, if permitted, killing the other characters or otherwise thwarting their play. Few players play only one way, or play one way all the time; most exhibit a diverse style.{{R|bartle-taxonomy}}  According to [[Richard Bartle]], &quot;People go there as part of a hero's journey &amp;mdash; a means of self-discovery&quot;.{{R|stuart-bartle-herojourney}}

Research has suggested that various factors combine in MUDs to provide users with a sense of ''presence'' rather than simply communication.{{R|towell}}

==Grammatical usage and derived terms==
As a noun, the word '''MUD''' is variously written MUD, Mud, and mud, depending on speaker and context.  It is also used as a verb, with '''to mud''' meaning to play or interact with a MUD and '''mudding''' referring to the act of doing so.{{R|hahn-verb}}  A '''mudder''' is, naturally, one who MUDs.{{R|internetculture-mudder}}  [[Compound (linguistics)|Compound words]] and [[Portmanteau word|portmanteaux]] such as '''mudlist''', '''[[Cybersex|mudsex]]''', and '''[[mudflation]]''' are also regularly coined.  [[Pun]]s on the &quot;wet dirt&quot; meaning of &quot;mud&quot; are endemic, as with, for example, the names of the [[ROM (MUD)|ROM]] ('''R'''ivers '''o'''f '''M'''UD), [[TinyMUCK|MUCK]] and [[MUSH]] codebases and the MUD ''[[Muddy Waters (online game)|Muddy Waters]]''.

Out of this inspiration, he designed ''LPC'' as a special MUD language to make extending the game simple.  Lars says, '...I didn't think I would be able to design a good adventure.  By allowing wizards coding rights, I thought others could help me with this.'  The first running code was developed in a week on Unix System V using IPC, not BSD sockets.  Early object-oriented features only existed accidentally by way of the nature of MUDs manipulating objects.  As Lars learned C++, he gradually extended those features.  The result is that the whole LPMud was developed from a small prototype, gradually extended with features.&quot;'' &amp;mdash;'''[[George Reese (computer programmer)|George Reese]]'s''' ''LPMud Timeline''

 | quote = Programs in LPC programming language were developed to perform the following tasks: First, each set of CVs was separated into single CVs, and each of them were plotted. An average CV from all the CVs in one set was calculated and plotted as well. All images belonging to one set of CVs were combined into short animated movies to visualize the changes over time. The graphs of the averaged CVs from all measurement points within a line scan were combined into an animation for demonstrating the systematic changes along each of the Pt stripes. After that, specific parameters were extracted from each CV (see below). These parameters and some derived values were tabulated and plotted versus the x-coordinate of the measurement point. Thus, different graphs for each line scan were created showing the changes in specific properties along the thickness of the Pt stripe. The combined tabulated data for each wafer was then used to plot a 3D image of several parameters vs substrate composition and nominal thickness. The LPC programs were compiled using LDMud (V3.3.719).
