'''Stephen Todd Alford''' (born November 23, 1964) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[basketball]] player and the current head coach of the [[University of New Mexico]] [[New Mexico Lobos men's basketball|Lobos men's basketball team]]. Alford, a former [[college basketball]] star and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player, was born in [[Franklin, Indiana]] and he grew up in [[New Castle, Indiana]].

==Biography==
===Playing career===
====High school====
Alford played basketball at the high school level for his father, Sam Alford, who was coach at [[New Castle Chrysler High School]] in New Castle. As a high school senior, he averaged 37.7 points per game helping him earn the title of [[Indiana &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot; award|Indiana's Mr. Basketball]] in 1983.

====College====
Alford attended [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. During his time there, he played basketball under head coach [[Bob Knight]].  At Indiana, Alford became the university's all time leading scorer with 2,438 points - a record later eclipsed by [[Calbert Cheaney]] (who eventually went on to become the Big Ten's all time leading scorer).  Alford was the first player to be named the team's MVP four times. He was also a first team All-American, and was the named Big Ten MVP during the 1986-87 season. In the Legends of College Basketball by ''The Sporting News'' Alford was #35 on the list of the 100 greatest Division-I college basketball players. When ''The Sporting News'' named its top ten NCAA basketball players of the 1980s in December 1989, Alford was listed at number ten.

During his final three seasons, Alford earned first team all-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] honors. As a freshman, he helped lead Indiana to an upset of the [[Michael Jordan]] led [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] in the 1984 NCAA tournament. As a sophomore Alford was named to the NIT All-Tournament team after the Hoosiers finished second behind [[UCLA]]. He earned All-America honors as a junior.

In 1987, Alford led the Hoosiers to the NCAA Championship Game against Syracuse. The Hoosiers won the game on a late baseline jumpshot by Indiana guard [[Keith Smart]]. Alford did his part, shooting 7â10 from the 3-point line, scoring 23 points.  It was Indiana's fifth National Championship in program history.

For the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] Alford was selected to play on the U.S. basketball team, coached by [[Bob Knight]]. Alford averaged 10.3 points per game, was second in assists, and shot .644 from the field. He and his teammates went on to win the gold medal at the 1984 games. In this game Alford played alongside [[Michael Jordan]], [[Patrick Ewing]], [[Sam Perkins]], [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]] and [[Wayman Tisdale]]. Alford has recounted that during the Olympic training camp, Jordan bet him $100 that he would not last four years on Knight's Indiana team.

====Professional====
Many fans in Indiana expected Alford to be drafted by the [[Indiana Pacers]], but the Pacers selected [[Reggie Miller]] instead, and Alford fell to the [[Dallas Mavericks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2zFHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=83oMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2341,4782017&amp;dq=steve-alford+reggie-miller&amp;hl=en Miller, Skiles, But No Alford for Pacers]&lt;/ref&gt; Alford played in the NBA for four seasons, mostly with the Dallas Mavericks, though he spent a portion of one season with [[Golden State Warriors]]. Over the course of his career, he started three games, scored 744 points, had 176 assists, and shot free throws with an accuracy of 87 percent.

===Coaching career===
====Manchester College Spartans====
Alford began his college coaching career in [[North Manchester, Indiana]]. He started in 1991 as head coach of the Division III [[Manchester College (Indiana)|Manchester College]]'s basketball program. During his four seasons with the team, Alford had a record of 78â29. When Alford began coaching that team, the team had lost its first eight games. During his first season there Alford won four of 20 games. In his first full season as coach the team posted a record of 20â8. In the next season Manchester posted a record of 23â4, and in his fourth and final season his team posted a record of 31â1.

In 1994 and 1995 Manchester won conference titles, and in Alford's final three seasons the team competed in the NCAA Division III Tournament. Under Alford, the team won three straight conference tournament titles (1993, 1994, 1995). The team advanced to the Division III championship game in 1995, placing second in the nation after suffering its first defeat in 32 games. 

In 1993, 1994, and 1995 Alford was named the Indiana Collegiate Conference Coach of the Year. In the 1994-95 season the Manchester team was inducted into the school Hall of Fame. In 1999 Alford was also inducted into Manchester's Hall of Fame.

====Southwest Missouri State Bears====
Following his time at Manchester, Alford was named the head coach at [[Missouri State University|Southwest Missouri State University]]. He began his position there in the 1995-96 season, and would remain there until 1999. During his time at Missouri State, his teams posted a 78â48 record. In 1999 the Bears advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament before losing to [[Duke University|Duke]].

====Iowa Hawkeyes====
Steve Alford was named the head coach of the [[University of Iowa]] Hawkeyes men's basketball program on March 22, 1999.

Although Alford's first game as coach was a 70â68 victory against the defending national champion [[University of Connecticut|Connecticut Huskies]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], his team went 14-16 during his first season at Iowa. During his second year (2000â01) the Hawkeyes went 23â12 in the regular season and 7â9 in the [[Big Ten Conference]] regular season, but they won the [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]] with four straight wins against [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]], [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], and [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana]]. This earned them a #7 seed in the [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], where they defeated [[Creighton University|Creighton]] in the first round but lost to [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] in the second round.

The Hawkeyes' conference record dropped to 5â11 during the 2001â02 season, but they defeated [[Purdue University|Purdue]], [[University of WisconsinâMadison|Wisconsin]], and Indiana in the Big Ten Tournament before losing to Ohio State in the finals. The Hawkeyes played in the [[National Invitation Tournament]] that season, but lost to [[Louisiana State University|LSU]] in the first round to finish with a 19â16 record. This was the first of three straight seasons that the Hawkeyes played in the NIT under Alford. They won the first two rounds of the 2003 tournament against [[Valparaiso University|Valparaiso]] and [[Iowa State University|Iowa State]] before losing to [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], finishing with a 17â14 record. In 2004 they lost to [[Saint Louis University|St. Louis]] in the first round of the NIT to finish 16â13 despite a 9â7 conference record (the first winning Big Ten Conference record under Alford).

The Hawkeyes finished 21-12 with a 7-9 conference record in the 2004-2005 regular season, but they won their first two Big Ten Tournament games against [[Purdue University|Purdue]] and [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]] before losing the third game to [[Wisconsin Badgers|Wisconsin]], 59-56. They earned an at-large invitation to the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005 NCAA Tournament]] as a #10 seed, where they lost 76-64 to [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]] in the first round. During the season, leading scorer [[Pierre Pierce]] was dismissed from the team amid charges of [[sexual abuse]]; Pierce ultimately served one year in prison.

During the 2005â06 season, the Hawkeyes went undefeated at [[Carver-Hawkeye Arena]] and finished in a second-place tie with [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Illinois]] with an 11-5 conference record, one game behind Ohio State. However, the Hawkeyes defeated [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]], Michigan State, and Ohio State to win the Big Ten Tournament and finish 25-8 going into its third NCAA Tournament under Alford. They were seeded #3 in the Atlanta Regional of the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006 NCAA Tournament]], but lost in a first-round upset to #14 seed [[Northwestern State University|Northwestern State]] 64-63, leaving Alford with only one NCAA Tournament win since taking over at Iowa.

During the 2006â2007 season, Alford led the Hawkeyes to an 8â6 non-conference record (losing to in-state rivals Drake and Northern Iowa) and an 9â7 record in the Big Ten Conference (17-14 overall). Iowa failed to make the NCAA tournament or the NIT. It marked the first time since the 1976â1977 season that an Iowa team with a winning record has failed to make either the NCAA tournament or the NIT.

At the conclusion of the [[2006-07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006â2007 season]], Alford resigned from the University of Iowa to accept the coaching position at the [[University of New Mexico]].

====New Mexico Lobos====
Alford was named head coach at the [[University of New Mexico]] on March 23, 2007 replacing the fired [[Ritchie McKay]]. In his first year as the [[New Mexico Lobos|Lobos]] coach Alford posted a record of 24â9, 11â5 in league play. Twenty-four wins is the most for a New Mexico head coach in their first year. The Lobos were led by future 1st round [[Boston Celtics]] draft pick [[J. R. Giddens]].  The Lobos were eliminated in the first round of the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] by [[University of California, Berkeley|Cal]].

In his second season, led by seniors [[Daniel Faris]], [[Tony Danridge]] and [[Chad Toppert]], Alford guided the Lobos to their first conference championship in 15 years.  He earned the [[MWC coach of the year award]] for his team's performance. Alford also set a record for most wins in the first two seasons for a UNM head coach.  Alford and his New Mexico squad fell just short of the NCAA tourney and ended up with their second consecutive NIT bid.  They won a first round home game against [[Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball|Nebraska]] and lost on a last second buzzer beater on the road to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].

His third year, coaching a mostly young, untested team, Alford's Lobos nevertheless won the regular season MWC title for the second year in a row, were ranked in the top 15 for the majority of the year, and earned a #3 seed in the NCAA Tournament, the team's first bid since 2005. In the first round, they survived a tough game against [[Montana Grizzlies|Montana]] 62â57, but despite [[Dairese Gary]]'s 28 points, fell in the second round to an upstart [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] side.  At the end of the season Coach Alford received a ten year contract extension through the 2019â20 season.

==Controversy==
In the 2010 season during a post-game handshake line, Alford had a confrontation with a BYU forward player in which Alford called him an &quot;extremely vulgar&quot; name, according to the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704698004576104290412900776.html Wall Street Journal] from online.wsj.com, accessed January 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
