==BAE controversy==
Day became a senior military adviser to BAE Systems in 2003. The independent watchdog monitoring the movement of officials to companies recommended that he should wait a year before taking up his new BAE job, due to his history as head of [[RAF Strike Command]]. The committee warned that Day &quot;had been involved with Air Force Board decisions which would have a direct bearing on the MoD's business with BAE&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/jun/08/bae1 BAE's lobbying]&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially [[Tony Blair]] then personally overruled the watchdog, saying that it was &quot;in the [[national interest]]&lt;ref name='Commons'&gt;{{cite news | first=Oonagh Gay | last= | coauthors= | title=Business Appointment Rules | date= | publisher= | url = http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03745.pdf | work =[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-15 | language = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; to let Day move to the firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/oct/05/saudiarabia.armstrade BAE chief linked to slush fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinook helicopter crash Board of Inquiry==
In 1995, following the [[Chinook Helicopter Crash (1994)|Chinook Helicopter Crash]] on the [[Mull of Kintyre]], Day was the Reviewing Officer of the Board of Inquiry which had failed to find a cause of the accident.  Despite a lack of Accident Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder, Day concluded that pilot error was the cause of the crash and found the pilots guilty of gross negligence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/chinookinquiry/Hoon-wont-change-Chinook-decision.2345594.jp Hoon wonât change Chinook decision] The Scotsman, 23 July 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Following a subsequent Scottish Fatal Accident Inquiry and [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] report, a [[House of Lords]] Select Committee was appointed to consider all the circumstances surrounding the crash and unanimously concluded &quot;that the reviewing officers were not justified in finding that negligence on the part of the pilots caused the aircraft to crash&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Report from the Select Committee on Chinook ZD 576 dated 31 Jan 02&lt;/ref&gt;
