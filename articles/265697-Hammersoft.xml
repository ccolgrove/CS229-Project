The '''University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP),''' established in 1938, is a sports association of eight universities in the [[Philippines]]. Each year, teams from these universities play in 15 sports.

==History==
In 1924, Dr. Regino Ylanan (then University of the Philippines Physical Education Director) saw the need to regulate and set general athletic policies; met with representatives of [[University of Santo Tomas]], [[Manila Central University]], [[National University (Philippines)|National University]], [[De La Salle College]], [[Ateneo de Manila]] and Institute of Accounts (now [[Far Eastern University]]) to discuss possibilities of forming an athletic organization, which eventually became the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).

In 1930, the [[University of the Philippines]] sponsored an experimental meet with the &quot;Big 3&quot; of the league (UST, NU, UP) on basketball, football, baseball, volleyball, swimming, track and field, relays, and tennis.
     
In 1931, the NCAA Board of Directors divided the meet into three divisions to put competition on a fairer basis and to stimulate athletics among a greater number.
     
In March 1932, UP, UST and NU formally seceded from the NCAA. Led by UP's Candido C. Bartolome, NU's Leon Tirol and UST's Fr. Silvestre Sancho, the move was made to put competitions on equal footing, to increase amateur athletic competitions and to separate the universities from the college members of the league. On April 6, the &quot;Big 3 League&quot; is born. On August 14, the &quot;Big 3&quot; Association is inaugurated with a meet that starts with basketball. Other events were swimming, baseball, relays, track and field, volleyball, tennis and soccer.  

In 1935, UP did not participate in the &quot;Big 3 League&quot; because of mass intramurals at the state university. NU and UST held the meet with FEU (formerly Institute of Accounts) taking UP's place.

In 1938, the University of the Philippines Alumni Association and the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAAF), then the highest sports body in the country, encouraged the original &quot;Big 3 League&quot; and FEU to form a permanent sports associationâthe University Athletic Association of the Philippines. Events included were basketball, women's volleyball, baseball, football, swimming and track and field. UP bagged three titles (volleyball, baseball, track and field). UST was tops in football and swimming and FEU triumphed in basketball.

In 1941, the outbreak of World War II hindered the staging of the 1941â1942 UAAP with UST failing to complete its term.
 
In 1952, [[University of the East]], [[University of Manila]], [[Adamson University]], and Manila Central University were granted two-year probationary membership to the UAAP.
     
In 1954, UE was permanently accepted into the league. The other three universities (UM, Adamson, and MCU) were dropped from the UAAP due to their inability to comply with the UAAP requirements. 
     
In 1970, [[Adamson University]] reapplied for admission to the league with a two-year probationary period.
     
In 1974, Adamson successfully hosted the 1974â1975 athletic season paving the way for its permanent membership into the league.

In 1978, The UAAP admitted [[Ateneo de Manila University]] into the league.
     
In 1986, [[De La Salle University]] joined the league.

==Logo==
The UAAP logo features the university colors of the eight member-schools of the league in a circular formation. It also bears the year when the league was established, 1938, in the center.

The logo changes every season where the university colors of the season host is placed on the very top. Nonetheless, the arrangement of the colors never changes.

The colors of '''University of the Philippines''' (green and maroon), '''University of Santo Tomas''' (gold and white), '''Far Eastern University''' (gold and green), and '''National University''' (gold and blue) come first, clockwise. These are followed by the colors of '''Ateneo de Manila University''' (blue and white), '''De La Salle University''' (green and white), '''Adamson University''' (blue and white), and '''University of the East''' (red and white).

==Member schools==
Following is a list of those universities with their team designations.

Member universities compete in 15 sports. [[Basketball]], being the most popular sport in the Philippines, is the most watched and most supported among all the sports.

All of these sports have Men's and Women's divisions, with the exception of [[baseball]], in which only men participate, and [[softball]], which is for women only. The following sports have a Junior division, in which the associated [[high school]]s of the universities participate: for both Boys' and Girls' (swimming and volleyball) and for Boys' only (track and field, chess, football, judo, taekwondo, table tennis and swimming,).

As of now, only four of the eight member universities participate in all sports, namely the [[Ateneo de Manila University]], the [[De La Salle University]], the [[University of the Philippines Diliman|University of the Philippines]], and the [[University of Santo Tomas]].

==Rivalries==
===AteneoâLa Salle rivalry===
{{main|AteneoâLa Salle rivalry}}
The rivalry between [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and [[De La Salle University]] has resulted in sold-out games that attract several public figures in attendance, including politicians, movie stars, and foreign diplomats.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/sports/23rivalry.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title=A Nation's Passion Lives in a Rivalry of Green vs. Blue |publisher=[[New York Times]] nytimes.com. |accessdate=September 2008 |first=Rafael |last=Bartholomew | date=September 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UPâUST cheerdance rivalry===
The [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition#UPâUST rivalry|cheerdance rivalry]] between [[University of the Philippines]] and [[University of Santo Tomas]] has been one of the most talked about rivalries in [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition|UAAP]] history. Since the inception of the [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition|cheerdance]], UP and UST have had the best winning records, and one is usually just a runner up to the other. Both schools' pep squads are famous for their stunts and high-energy performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/09/16/10/ust-friendship-emerges-after-cheerdance-competition |title='UP-UST friendship' emerges after cheerdance competition |publisher=[[ABS-CBN]] abs-cbnnews.com. |accessdate=July 16, 2011 |first=Karen |last=Flores | date=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===La SalleâUST rivalry===
{{main|La SalleâUST rivalry}}
Both were known for their numerous basketball championship matches in the 1990s, with UST winning four straight titles at the expense of the Green Archers. In 1999, La Salle defeated the Growling Tigers to win the basketball crown. Their basketball rivalry diminished in latter years due to UST's decline but became a celebrated rivalry in women's volleyball, as the Lady Archers and the Tigresses met three times in the championship of the [[Shakey's V-League]] tournament with UST having 5 championships and La Salle having 3 under their belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/manila-bulletin/mi_7968/is_2010_Feb_21/la-salle-ust-duel-volleyball/ai_n50161055/ |title=La Salle, UST duel for volleyball title |work=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=2010-02-21 |publisher=findarticles.com |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry was carried over to the UAAP.

===FEUâUE rivalry===
The rivalry between [[Far Eastern University]] and [[University of the East]] started in the 1950s. Tagged as the &quot;Battle of the East&quot;, these two schools, along with UST, have the winningest basketball squads in the league (FEU having won 19 basketball championships while UE having won 18 titles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mendoza|first=Shielo|title=FEU Tamaraws|url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/blogs/collegehoops/feu-tamaraws-103707081.html|work=College Hoops|publisher=Yahoo Southeat Asia|accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
