He is also known for the role of Attorney Michael Reston in the Perry Mason TV movies.

==Early life==
Stiers was born in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], Illinois, the son of Margaret Elizabeth (nÃ©e Ogden) and Kenneth Truman Stiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/94/David-Ogden-Stiers.html|title = ''Film Reference'' bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Urbana High School (Illinois)|Urbana High School]], at the same time as film critic [[Roger Ebert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://davidogdenstiers.com/bio/index.shtml|title = David Ogden Stiers Unofficial website â David Ogden Stiers Fan Tribute site}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later relocated to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], Oregon, where he graduated from [[North Eugene High School]] and briefly attended the [[University of Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.usanetwork.com/series/thedeadzone/seejohnnysworld/fivequestionsfor/stiers.html|title = USA Network's Five Questions With David Ogden Stiers}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later ventured to San Francisco, where he performed with the California Shakespeare Theater, San Francisco Actors Workshop, and the improv group [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]], whose members included [[Rob Reiner]] and [[Howard Hesseman]]. Soon after, Stiers studied drama at [[Juilliard]]. During his studies, Stiers was mentored by accomplished theater actor [[John Houseman]] and would later join his City Center [[The Acting Company|Acting Company]].

==Career==
===Early acting credits===
Stiers first appeared in the Broadway production ''The Magic Show'' in 1974 in the minor role of Feldman. Later his early credits include ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[Kojak]]'', and ''[[Rhoda]]''. Stiers also appeared in the pilot of ''[[Charlie's Angels|Charlieâs Angels]]'' as the team's chief back-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hollywood Dot Com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/David_Ogden_Stiers/189878#full|title = Hollywood Dot Com Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''M*A*S*H'' (1977â1983)===
In 1977, Stiers joined the cast of the now [[iconic]] [[CBS-TV]] sitcom ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. As [[Major Charles Emerson Winchester III]], Stiers filled the void created by the departure of actor [[Larry Linville]]'s [[Frank Burns]] character. In contrast to the buffoonish Burns, Winchester was a well-spoken and talented surgeon who presented a different type of foil to [[Alan Alda]]'s [[Hawkeye Pierce]] and [[Mike Farrell]]'s [[B.J. Hunnicutt]]. Burns usually served as the butt of practical jokes instigated by Hawkeye or B.J., and his surgical skills were often harshly criticized. Charles, however, presented a challenge to his colleagues' displays of irreverence because his surgical skills could match or even outshine theirs; his aristocratic manner and aversion to the puerile behavior served as the target for his fellow surgeons' barbs and jokes. For his portrayal of the pompous but nonetheless multidimensional Boston aristocrat, Stiers received two [[Emmy Award]] nominations.

===Other television work===
Following the completion of ''M*A*S*H'', Stiers expanded his work on television with regular guest appearances on ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]''; ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''; ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''; ''[[Touched By An Angel]]''; ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]''; and ''[[Frasier]]'', along with a recurring role in Season 1 of ''[[Two Guys and a Girl]]'' as Mr. Bauer. In 1984, he portrayed [[United States Olympic Committee]] founder, [[William Milligan Sloane]] in the [[NBC]] [[miniseries]], ''The First Olympics:  Athens, 1896''.  He also had guest appearances on ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' and ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]''. He appeared in two unsuccessful television projects, ''Love &amp; Money'' and ''[[Justice League of America (1997 film)|Justice League of America]]'' (as the [[Martian Manhunter]]). In 2002, Stiers started a recurring role as the Reverend Purdy on the successful [[USA Network]] show ''[[The Dead Zone (TV series)|The Dead Zone]]'' with [[Anthony Michael Hall]]. In 2006, he was cast as the recurring character Oberoth in ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''. Stiers also appeared in several ''[[Perry Mason]]'' made-for-TV movies in the 1980s as District Attorney Michael Reston.

===Film work===
Stiers's early films included [[Jack Nicholson|Jack Nicholsonâs]] ''[[Drive, He Said]]'' and the [[George Burns]] comedy ''[[Oh, God!]]'' He followed up with roles in ''[[Harry's War (1981 film)|Harry's War]]'', ''[[Better Off Dead (film)|Better Off Dead]]'', ''[[The Man With One Red Shoe]]'', ''[[The Accidental Tourist (film)|The Accidental Tourist]]'', ''[[Iron Will]]'', ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', ''[[Jungle 2 Jungle]]'', and ''[[Krippendorf's Tribe]]''. During the 1990s, Stiers joined [[Woody Allen|Woody Allenâs]] ensemble casts in ''[[Another Woman]]'', ''[[Shadows and Fog]]'', ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'', ''[[Everyone Says I Love You]]'', and ''[[The Curse of the Jade Scorpion]]''. His most recent film appearance was in the 2001 film ''[[The Majestic (film)|The Majestic]]'', with [[Jim Carrey]]. He also voiced the character Kamaji in Hayao Miyazaki's ''[[Spirited Away]]'' and the engineer Piccolo in ''[[Porco Rosso]]''.

===Vocal work===
Stiers has provided voice work for dozens of film and television projects. His first work was on one of  [[George Lucas|George Lucasâ]] earliest films, the critically acclaimed ''[[THX 1138]]'', in which he was incorrectly billed as &quot;David Ogden Steers&quot;.  Stiers has voiced PBS documentary films such as [[Ric Burns]]â project ''[[New York: A Documentary Film]]'' and several episodes of the documentary television series ''[[The American Experience]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/ansel/filmmore/filmcredits.html|title = Ansel Adams: A Documentary Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Ansel Adams]] (2002), also directed by [[Ric Burns]]. In 1992, he voiced Mr. Piccolo in the animated English-dubbed version of ''[[Porco Rosso]]''.  Furthermore, he has collaborated with [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] on eight animated features, such as ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (as Cogsworth, also opening narration), ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (as the Archdeacon), ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (as Governor Ratcliffe and Wiggins), ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' (as Mr. Harcourt), and ''[[Lilo and Stitch]]'' (as Jumba Jookiba).
