'''Conifer Grove''' is a suburb of [[Auckland]], in northern [[New Zealand]]. Located on the eastern shores of the [[Pahurehure]] Inlet, on the [[Manukau Harbour]], under authority of the [[Auckland Council]]. The suburb makes up the western side of the [[Takanini]] urban area and is in the Manurewa-Papakura ward of Auckland city.

==History==

Conifer Grove was constructed around 1965-1970. Conifer Grove's modern area (including Keywella Drive, Aristoy Close and Chippewa Place) was previously a farm to which connected onto [[Great South Road]] is now the [[Manukau]] Golf Course. Number 1 Brylee Drive (white picket fence at the roundabout) is the original farm house. Conifer Grove School showcases historic photos of the region in their school office.

During the major reformation of local government in 1989, Conifer Grove was re-zoned and the area was included into the [[Papakura District]] boundaries. 

From October 2010, after a review of the [[Royal Commission on Auckland Governance]], the entire [[Auckland Region]] will be amalgamated into a single city authority. As well as the current [[Papakura District]], other territorial authorities will be abolished and the entire area will be dissolved into a single [[Auckland]] city council. The suburb of Conifer Grove will now be in the ''Manurewa-Papakura Ward'' of the [[Auckland Council]].

==People==

The most common ethnic group in Conifer Grove is [[Europe]]an as at 2006, with 66.2 percent. [[MÄori people|Maori]] residents make up 17.7 percent of the suburb, and [[Asia]]n residents consisting of 10.3 percent.

Fraser Thomas were awarded Certificates of Merit by both the Association of Consulting Engineers NZ and the New Zealand Institute of Surveyors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraserthomas.co.nz/job%20profiles/sur-conifer.htm Conifer Grove] (from the [[Fraser Thomas]] website. Accessed 2008-03-16.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==

Conifer Grove has a small shopping centre with two restaurants, a hair dressers, clothing boutique, real estate agent, architect, chemist, fish and chip shop and dairy. Located in the grove is also conifer grove primary school and kindergarten.  There are various parks/reserves such as Brylee Drive Reserve with two tennis courts and playground. This links to a board walk which goes around the waters/mangroves edge, which is enjoyed by many of the residents.  This walk is currently (mid 2008) being extended to connect the boardwalk through to Walter Strevens Drive reserve.

Conifer Grove has an old part before the bridge, and newer areas on the other side of the bridge. Most of the streets are [[cul-de-sac]]s. Due to the suburbs design pattern, there is only one way in and out of the newer area of Conifer Grove. This roundabout also has a security camera which records vehicle movement in and out of the area.
