[[image:FijiWaterDisplay.jpg|thumb|right|FIJI Water for sale in a deli.]]'''FIJI Water''' is a U.S.-based business and brand of [[bottled water]] derived, bottled, and shipped from the [[Fiji Islands]]. It is available in 330ml, 500ml, 1 liter and 1.5 liter [[bottles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fijifaq&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

== History ==
FIJI Water was started in 1996 by David Gilmour, one-time partner in [[Clairtone Sound Corporation Limited]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hollycouple&quot;&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', [http://www.smh.com.au/news/Business/Hollywood-couple-buys-Fiji-Water-for-63m/2004/11/29/1101577419156.html &quot;Hollywood couple buys Fiji Water for $63m&quot;], November 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Wealthy industrial agriculture couple Stewart and [[Lynda Resnick|Lynda Rae Resnick]] (also affiliated with [[Teleflora]], [[POM Wonderful]], Suterra, and Paramount Agribusiness)&lt;ref name=&quot;corps&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; are the current owners.

In late 2010 FIJI Water acquired JUSTIN Vineyards and Winery of Paso Robles, California, in an effort to leverage their brand over a wider variety of products.  JUSTIN is known best for producing California style Bordeaux and Syrah wines distributed throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Huffstutter.

==In Fiji==
In 2007-2008, disputes with the Fiji government over export duties led to legal cases, impounded shipments and a self-imposed industry-wide shutdown of Fijian water bottlers. The government eventually dropped its proposed 20-cent per liter tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2008/07/26/fiji-government-yields-to-bottled-water-company-pressure/ Fiji government yields to bottled water company pressure], IceNews, Chris Bolwig, July 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, FIJI Water laid off 40% of its staff due to weakening sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jan2009/db20090130_552851.htm?chan=rss_topDiscussed_ssi_5 Bottled Waters Lose Their Effervescence], Business Week, January 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Fiji deported Fiji Water director of external affairs, David Roth, for &quot;interfering in Fijiâs domestic affairs,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiji Water shuts down business after tax hike|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=57313|accessdate=6 August 2011|newspaper=Radio New Zealand International|date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the resignation of interim defence and immigration minister, Ratu Epeli Ganilau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ganilau says Fiji Water row behind him quitting regime|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=57107|accessdate=6 August 2011|newspaper=Radio New Zealand International|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, an increase in the tax from one third of a [[Fiji dollar|Fiji cent]] per liter to 15 cents per liter for producers over 15 million liters/month which at that point in time applied only to Fiji Water, led the company to shut down its Fiji Island offices on November 29, 2010. This raise was to raise Fiji Water's tax contribution on to the Fiji Government on the F$150 million (AUD 82 million) they exported each year from F$500,000 to F$22.6 million &lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/world/water-works-shut-down-as-tax-trickle-turns-into-stream-20101129-18e19.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The next step for the brand was thought to be a move to New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.app.com/article/20101129/BUSINESS/101129015/Bottled-water-firm-closing-namesake-Fiji-business-&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aolnews.com/surge-desk/article/fiji-water-leaves-fiji-4-things-to-know-about-the-shutdown/19736926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_10691133&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10691133 |title=Mineral water giant pulls plug on Fiji |author=Adams, Guy |date=1 December 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after threats from the government to give the well to another company,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=131656523&lt;/ref&gt; the Fiji Water announced its intent to resume operations and accept the new tax levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Update: FIJI Water to Reopen December 1 | publisher=BevNET.com | date=2010-12-02 | url=http://www.bevnet.com/news/2010/11-30-2010-FIJI-Water-Update  | accessdate = 2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Fiji Water's Fiji plant had 400 employees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Union tells workers to value Fiji Water pay|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=57391|accessdate=6 August 2011|newspaper=Radio New Zealand International|date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiji Water has also established a foundation to provide water filters to Fiji communities, many of which lack access to clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiji Water helps Fiji villages to produce to clean water|url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=55578|accessdate=6 August 2011|newspaper=Radio New Zealand International|date=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
