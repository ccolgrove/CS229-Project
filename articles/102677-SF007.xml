== History ==

===CAD/CAM Period===

Dassault SystÃ¨mes was created in 1981 but really started in 1977 with 15 engineers of Avions Marcel Dassault who were in charge of helping the plane building process. While they were initially supposed to develop a 3D Computer-aided Design software ([[CATIA]], then called CATI) to help designing planes only, the engineers brought it up to another level to provide help to other industry sectors. 

At the end of 1980, the CATIA rumor reached the very top of the company and [[Marcel Dassault]], then aged 88, asked for a demonstration of the software capabilities.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.deelip.com/?p=4908 Marcel Dassault Asks for a CATIA Demonstration&lt;/ref&gt; The company management understood the engineersâ vision and started to debate on how to leverage such an innovation. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.deelip.com/?p=4908 Avions Marcel Dassault Decides to Create Dassault Systemes&lt;/ref&gt; They quickly realized they could not afford to keep and develop this invention internally and decided to create a new company to explore the Computer-aided Design and Computer-aided Manufacturing market ([[Computer-aided design|CAD]]/[[ Computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]]).

Dassault SystÃ¨mes thus got started in 1981 with only one customer (Avions Marcel Dassault). They were only 25 engineers and didnât know how to sell and market their product.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.deelip.com/?p=4911 Dassault Systemes Starts with 25 Engineers&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, since the Dassault Group was one of IBM major clients in France, they negotiated a deal so that IBM markets CATIA. It was a non-exclusive, 50/50 revenue share agreement where CATIA would be sold by IBM as an IBM product. This deal had been extremely successful for both companies and it is considered as âone of the fundamental drivers of the Dassault SystÃ¨mes success storyâ. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.deelip.com/?p=4911 Dassault Systemes Partners with IBM&lt;/ref&gt;

CATIA started getting noticed in other sectors than the initial plane manufacturing one mainly with the automotive sector (BMW, Mercedes and Honda). This was a step by step approach that was used to progressively address all the other industries such as consumer goods, machinery and shipbuilding. IBM also became a customer in the mid 1980âs and deployed CATIA in its engineering and manufacturing plants. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deelip.com/?p=4917 IBM Becomes one of Dassault Systemesâ Customers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Dassault SystÃ¨mes improved its software and expanded to the US, Japan and Germany. This rapid growth triggered a chain of products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond the company's core 3D CAD/CAM software and led to what is known today as Dassault SystÃ¨mes.

===PLM Period===

By the end of the 20th century, CAD/CAM had become too restrictive to identify the Dassault SystÃ¨mes products. Then, in the early 2000âs, it was replaced by [[Product lifecycle management|PLM]], the acronym for Product Lifecycle Management.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.deelip.com/?p=4920 Dassault Systemes Turns into a PLM Company&lt;/ref&gt; New brand names were added to address the full PLM spectrum: [[DELMIA]] to support the manufacturing plant, [[ENOVIA MatrixOne|ENOVIA]] to support the collaboration internally and with the extended enterprise of customers, [[SIMULIA]] for Analysis and Simulation, [[SolidWorks]] for 3D modeling and [[3dvia|3Dvia]] for 3D visualization.

In 2007, along with the creation of the new brand 3DVIA, Dassault SystÃ¨mes started to get into online applications, what is now called PLM 2.0, as a reference to the [[Web 2.0]]. The company took advantages of the Internet possibilities and introduced online PLM with its Version 6 platform.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.deelip.com/?p=4920 Dassault Systemes Introduces PLM 2.0&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy has been followed by many other acquisitions such as the 2011 [[Exalead]] purchase to dive deeper into [[Internet search]] technologies.

==Corporate Culture==

===Passion for Innovation Programme===

Passion for Innovation is a corporate patronage which aims at giving free access to Dassault SystÃ¨mesâ software to non-profit organizations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3ds.com/company/passion-for-innovation/program/ Dassault Systemesâ patronage: Passion for Innovation&lt;/ref&gt;

The program started with a disabled employee who couldnât drive a sports car because of his physical issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3ds.com/company/passion-for-innovation/the-projects/the-neoclutch-driving-system/ Passion for Innovation First Project&lt;/ref&gt; He developed his own clutch idea but needed to test it virtually beforehand, driving with such a vital part of a car modified being very dangerous. He was granted a free access to CATIA and designed his idea which allowed him to eventually drive a sports car. 

Such a story fomented the creation of Passion for Innovation and since then it helped on several projects such as Xplorair, Khufu or Ice Dream for example.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3ds.com/company/passion-for-innovation/the-projects/xplorair/ Xplorair Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3ds.com/company/passion-for-innovation/the-projects/khufu-revealed/ Khufu Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3ds.com/icedream/ Ice Dream Project&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dassault SystÃ¨mes Campus===

Dassault SystÃ¨mes headquarters are in [[VÃ©lizy-Villacoublay]], located in the south-western suburbs of [[Paris]], [[France]]. With most of its employees under 40, the actual number of buildings (4) and green areas ({{convert|11.12|acre|m2}}) within the complex, it is often referred as the Dassault SystÃ¨mes campus, an allusion to its look and feel. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.3ds.com/company/about-dassault-systemes/ds-campus/ Dassault Systeme Campus&lt;/ref&gt;

Each building is named after one of the four main elements (water, earth, air and fire) and these represent 57,000 square meters of office space. They house what is called the âLIVESâ (Lifelike Immersive Virtual Experience Space) which is a demo center equipped with virtual reality technologies.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.3ds.com/company/about-dassault-systemes/ds-campus/ Lifelike Immersive Virtual Experience Space Lab at Dassault Systeme Campus&lt;/ref&gt;
