'''Software distribution''' can refer to:
* The process of software distribution, from creator to the user,
* A collection of software, also referred to as a '''distribution''', or a '''distro''', which is set of [[software component]]s built, assembled and configured so that it can be used essentially &quot;as is&quot; for its intended purpose.

Software distribution is often the closest thing to [[turnkey]] form of [[free software]]. It may take the form of a ''binary distribution'', with an [[executable]] installer which can be downloaded from the [[Internet]]. Examples range from whole operating system distributions to [[Server (computing)|server]] and [[interpreter (computer science)|interpreter]] distributions (for example [[WAMP]] installers).  ''Software distribution'' can also refer to [[careware]] and [[donateware]].

In recent years, the term has come to refer to nearly any &quot;finished&quot; software (i.e. something that is more or less ready for its intended use, whether as a complete system or a component of a larger system) that is assembled primarily from open source components.

==Examples==
Examples of '''software distributions''' include:
* [[Berkeley Software Distribution|Berkeley Software Distributions]] such as [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]] and [[DragonflyBSD]]
* [[Linux distribution|Linux distributions]] such as [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[SUSE Linux distributions|SUSE]], [[Debian]], and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]]
* [[Application server]]s such as [[JBoss]] or [[Apache Geronimo]]
* The [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse Europa]] release of software development tools
* The [[PostgreSQL]] relational database

==Distro support==
Technical support is a key issue for end-users of distributions, since the distribution itself is typically free and may not be &quot;owned&quot; in a commercial sense by a vendor. Depending on the distribution, support may be provided by a commercial support vendor, the developers who created the distribution or by the user community itself.

==Free software distribution tools==
[[GNU build system|GNU Autotools]] are widely used for distributions which consist of source files written in [[C++]] and the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], but are not limited to these.

==Distribution tools for mobile devices==
Distribution of software to small [[Mobile computer|mobile devices]] such as phones, PDAs and other hand-held terminals is a particular challenge due to their ad-hoc connectivity.
Some tools that cater to this category of devices are:
* [[Sybase iAnywhere]] Afaria
