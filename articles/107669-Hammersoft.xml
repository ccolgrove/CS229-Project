As of the 2010 census, the city population was 149,058.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laalmanac.com/population/po32.htm Most Populous Cities in Los Angeles County Populations of 100,000+ (1990 - 2010 Census)]. Los angeles Almanac. Retrieved 2011-05-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is the site of the [[Fairplex]], which hosts the [[Los Angeles County Fair|L.A. County Fair]] and the [[NHRA]] [[Auto Club Raceway at Pomona]], (formerly known as Pomona Raceway) [[Powerade]] Winternationals Drag Racing competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhra.com/tickets/pomona.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The city also hosts the Pomona Swap Meet and Classic Car Show is considered by many{{Who|date=September 2011}} to be a Southern California classic.

Since the 1980s, Pomona's newest neighborhood [[Phillips Ranch (Pomona), California|Phillips Ranch]], experienced rapid growth with homes still being built in the hilly area between Downtown and [[Diamond Bar, California|Diamond Bar]].  Today, Phillips Ranch is nearly all residential.&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, November 15, 1964, âHistoric Ranch to Be Big Communityâ[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/472218192.html?FMT=AI&amp;FMTS=::ABS:AI:CITE:PAGE&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+15%2C+1964&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Historic+Ranch+to+Be+Big+Community]&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Pomona has seen some gentrification with additional housing units added and revamped streetscapes.

== History ==
[[Image:ViewFromPomonaPark1904.jpg|thumb|left|250px|right|View down San Jose Creek from Pomona Park. 1904.]]

The area was originally occupied by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] or [[Gabrielino]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].
The city is named for [[Pomona]], the ancient Roman goddess of fruit. For Horticulturist, Solomon Gates, &quot;Pomona&quot; was the winning entry in a contest to name the city in 1875, before anyone had ever planted a fruit tree&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;[http://route66ca.org/traveler/towns/25pomona/history.html A Brief History of Pomona&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The city was first settled by Ricardo Vejar and Ygnacio Palomares in the 1830s, when California and much of the now-American Southwest were part of Mexico.  The first Anglo-Americans arrived in prior to 1848 when the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo resulted in California becoming part of the United States. &lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |editor=William D. Halsey |encyclopedia=Collier's Encyclopedia |title=Pomona |year=1976 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Corporation |volume=19 |page=232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1880s, the arrival of [[railroad]]s and [[Coachella Valley]] water had made it the western anchor of the [[citrus]]-growing region. Pomona was officially incorporated on January 6, 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;collier&quot;/&gt;

Religious institutions are deeply embedded in the history of Pomona. There are now more than 120 churches,representing most religions in today's society. The historical architecture of these churches provide glimpses of the European church design and architecture from other eras.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, Pomona citizens elected Norma Torres, the first woman of Guatemalan heritage to be elected to a mayoral post outside of Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/pomona-mayor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{In popular culture|date=August 2011}}
*Pomona is mentioned in the lyrics to [[Ronny &amp; the Daytonas]]' 1964 hit song &quot;G.T.O.&quot; (the Pomona Raceway at [[Fairplex]] being a well-known venue for [[drag racing]]). Also Pomona is mentioned in the lyrics to &quot;Honey Bee&quot; by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers.

*In an ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' episode, the main characters of the show &quot;go out to the country&quot; on a day trip to Pomona. This is now seen as odd due to Pomona since becoming quite urban. In 1940, [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] spent their honeymoon in downtown Pomona.

*In the 1940 [[Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] animated short ''Mr. Mouse Takes A Trip'', [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] is taking a train vacation from [[Burbank, CA|Burbank]] to Pomona. The conductor, [[Black Pete]], won't let him bring [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], so he hides Pluto in his suitcase, and tries to hide him all throughout the trip without much luck. Pete thinks he's won when Pluto is hooked by a mail hook, and Mickey follows, but the twist is they actually got off the train in Pomona, as Mickey said &quot;Look Pluto, Pomona, we're here&quot;.

*In [[Billy Wilder]]'s 1950 film ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', [[Norma Desmond]] ([[Gloria Swanson]]) describes to [[Joe Gillis]] ([[William Holden]]) a melodramatic film version of [[Salome]] that she has written for her return to cinema. Gillis cynically retorts &quot;They'll love it in Pomona&quot; and Desmond fails to notice his sarcasm, responding, &quot;They will love it every place.&quot;

*It was rumored that [[Walt Disney]] originally planned on having [[Disneyland]] built in Pomona, but the city council declined his offer, fearing that the park would not succeed and would cause the city to go into debt. According to Matthew Tresaugue, former reporter for the [[Inland Valley Daily Bulletin]], it was one of 71 considered cities, but was ruled out due to temperature extremes, i.e. too hot in summer and too cold at night. It is interesting to note, however, that author [[James Ellroy]] used Pomona as the setting for the fictional amusement park Dream-a-Dreamland in his novel [[L.A. Confidential]]. Dream-a-Dreamland and its fictional owner, the cartoon magnate Ray Dieterling, were based very closely on Disneyland and Walt Disney.

*In the 1979 [[Steven Spielberg]] film [[1941 (film)|1941]], the following takes place. [[Hollywood Boulevard]], 7:35 p.m.: Stilwell goes to see [[Dumbo]]. By 9:05 p.m., Birkhead and Donna are headed toward the 501st Bomb Disbursement Unit at [[Barstow, California|Barstow]], where Maddox shows them the unit's dilapidated [[aircraft]]. Maddox, convinced the [[Japan]]ese are sending parachutists into the hills near [[Pomona]], lets Birkhead and Donna borrow his aircraft, assuming they are going on reconnaissance.

*In the 2006 comedy ''[[Grandma's Boy (2006 film)|Grandma's Boy]]'', an American [[stoner film]] produced by [[Adam Sandler]]'s production company [[Happy Madison]], [[Peter Dante]]'s permanently-stoned character decides to buy a lion in order to protect his stash of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. In one scene, Dante can be seen smoking [[weed]] with an African tribesman, Dr. Shakalu, in his basement. When the main character, played by [[Allen Covert]], asks Dante about the nature of his relationship with Dr. Shakalu, Dante indicates that he met the doctor at a [[cockfight]] in Pomona.

*In the &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror XVI]]&quot; episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', during the introductory scene, during the Springfield Isoptopes's game Pomona was used in a parody of 'The OC'. A poster background dipicting the word Pomona in a 'The OC' template. The announcer prompts Fox's newest endeavor 'Pomona' &quot;it's even hotter ''away'' from the beach.&quot;
