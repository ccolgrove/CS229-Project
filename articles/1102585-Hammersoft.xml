The '''31st New Brunswick general election''' was held on October 13, 1987, to elect 58 members to the [[51st New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]], the governing house of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]. The [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal Party]] was victorious, for the first time since [[New Brunswick general election, 1967|1967]], in a [[Wipe-out results (elections)|landslide]] by winning all 58 seats in the [[Legislative Assembly|legislature]].

The popularity of [[Richard Hatfield]], who had served as a popular [[premier]] from 1970 through the [[New Brunswick general election, 1982|1982 election]], fell due  to scandals in his last term. In [[1984]], during an official visit to New Brunswick by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officers found [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in Hatfield's luggage.  Hatfield was later [[acquittal|acquitted]] of marijuana possession charges. As reported by the media, Hatfield was also alleged to have hosted parties with young men where illegal drugs were used  .&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/provincial_territorial_politics/clips/13859/&lt;/ref&gt; He was criticized by [[parliamentary opposition|opposition parties]] and by the media for extravagant use of the government plane, which he used to travel to [[New York City]] where he  visited night clubs, earning him the nickname &quot;Disco Dick&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/provincial_territorial_politics/clips/13859/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1985]], three [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]]-area [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservative]] members of the legislature (MLAs) challenged Hatfield's leadership and led a brief [[caucus revolt]] after the Liberals won two [[by-elections]] in previously [[Tory]] seats, but Hatfield  led the party through a fifth election.

Hoping to boost his popularity enough to avoid defeat, Hatfield delayed calling the election as long as possible.  It was finally held on October 13, 1987, five years and a day since the last election -- the longest allowed by the [[Constitution of Canada]].  Hatfield lost every seat, including his own. He took full responsibility for the defeat. He announced his resignation the night of the election while being interviewed by media outside of his [[Hartland, New Brunswick|Hartland]] home, where he had been abandoned by his supporters early in the evening as the returns began to come in.

[[Frank McKenna]]'s Liberals were virtually assured victory from day one, thanks to Hatfield's scandals, but ran a very successful campaign allowing them to sweep the province.  The [[New Democratic Party of New Brunswick|New Democrats]] also suffered a moral defeat, losing their one seat -- something they had won for the first time in 1982.
