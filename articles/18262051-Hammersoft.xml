The '''University of New Mexico School of Law''' is the [[law school]] of the [[University of New Mexico]], located in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]. It is the only law school in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[New Mexico]]. Approximately 350 students attend the school, with approximately 115 enrolled in the first-year class. By design, the school has remained this size in order to provide students more hands-on learning and individual attention from professors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawschool.unm.edu/about/index.php UNM Law School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its student-to-faculty ratio of 10.0 is one of the best in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gradschools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/law/items/03100 USNews: America's Best Graduate Schools 2008: Law: New Mexico&lt;!--Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It also has one of the highest student diversity indexes of any law school in the country, with [[Hispanic]]s as the largest [[Ethnic minority|minority]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/law USNews: America's Best Graduate Schools 2008: Law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is currently ranked 67th by US News &amp; World Report and boasts the 6th ranked Clinical Law program in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/law/clinical USNews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   UNM Law School is one of only 80 law schools nationwide to have a chapter of the prestigious [[Order of the Coif]].

==Academics==
=== Notable Programs===
Highly regarded educational programs at the law school include clinical education, Indian law, and natural resources and environmental law.
The in-house Clinical Law Program has been consistently recognized as among the countryâs best.  Participation in the clinic is required of all students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawschool.unm.edu/clinic/index.php About the Clinical Program - Clinical Law Programs | UNM School of Law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Law Program includes a specialized program of study leading to a certificate in Indian Law, the Southwest Indian Law Clinic, and the faculty-edited ''[http://tlj.unm.edu/ Tribal Law Journal]''.
The Natural Resources and Environmental Law Program includes a specialized program of study leading to a certificate in the field and the faculty-edited ''[http://lawschool.unm.edu/nrj/sitemap.php Natural Resources Journal]''.

The School of Law has an unusual relationship with the state government.  Under the terms of the Constitution, the Dean of the School of Law has the responsibility of chairing the [http://lawschool.unm.edu/judsel/index.php state's judicial selection process].  The Dean also has the statutory responsibility of chairing the state's [http://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2009/chapter-34/article-1/section-34-1-10/ Judicial Compensation Commission] and serving on numerous other boards, committees and commisions.  Moreover, the School of Law has the primary responsibility for all [http://jec.unm.edu/ judicial education] within the state. 

===Exchange and Study Abroad Programs===
Study abroad opportunities are available with special UNM exchange programs in [http://mexicanlawclasses.unm.edu/index.php Mexico], Canada, and [http://lawschool.unm.edu/about/index.php Tasmania]. The law school also has an exchange program with the [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]], which allows UNM students to study patent and intellectual property law at that [[New Hampshire]] school.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawschool.unm.edu/academics/exchange/pierce.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint Degrees===
The school offers the following joint degrees:
* J.D./Master of Public Administration,
* J.D./M.B.A.,
* J.D./M.A. in Latin American Studies, and
* J.D./M.A. in Water Resources.
Students may seek other dual programs with permission of the relevant graduate or professional school at the University of New Mexico and the law school.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawschool.unm.edu/about/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Admissions==
The School of Law describes its admissions process as follows:
A five-member Admissions Committee reviews all applications and makes final decisions on acceptance for admission into the next fallâs entering class. The Committee is three full-time faculty members, the Assistant Dean for Admissions, and one third-year law student elected by the student body.
The Committee begins reviewing files near the end of the Fall semester; however, in many instances, a final decision is not made until late April. The Admissions Committee considers quantifiable factors (LSAT and grade point average) and non-quantifiable factors (letters of recommendation, personal statement, and extracurricular activities) in making decisions. A substantial preference is given to New Mexico residents. The Committee also recognizes that special pre-law programs for minority and disadvantaged applicants provide valuable information about an applicantâs ability to succeed in law school, and participation in such programs is taken into account.
Applicants will receive email notification when their applications have been received and again when they are complete and ready for review. Applicants will receive decision letters by mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawschool.unm.edu/admissions/index.php About Admissions - Admissions | UNM School of Law&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unm.edu/news/Releases/03-12-16lawmeritaward.htm Unm Law School Earns Merit Award For Building Addition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The New Mexico Court of Appeals is located on campus, next door to the School of Law.  The Court of Appeals and the School of Law have a symbiotic relationship with the judges using the law school's library and the students using the Court of Appeal's formal courtroom.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals was designed for this use, with classrooms for law students adjacent to the formal courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harbert|first=Nancy|title=Moot Courtroom Turned into Classroom|url=http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1t8w2/UNMLaw2011/resources/8.htm|accessdate=13 November 2011|newspaper=UNM Law 2011|date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
