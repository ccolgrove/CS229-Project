City residents voted to become a [[charter city]] in a special municipal election on November 29, 2005.

==Early history==
The city of Bell  has a Native American history dating back thousands of years. The GabrieliÃ±o Indians migrated to the place now called Bell in 500 B.C. Spaniards have been living in this area of California since the mid-16th century. Among the early Spanish settlers was one of Californiaâs first families, the [[Lugo]]s. While stationed at [[Mission San Antonio de Padua]] near [[Salinas, California|Salinas]], California, Francisco Lugoâs first California son, Antonio Maria Lugo was born in 1775.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bell.k12.ca.us/decades/history/timeline.htm |title=Timeline |publisher=Bell.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That son became Don Antonio Maria Lugo, Spanish aristocrat and  soldier, who settled on 30,000  acres of land that encompasses what is now the city of Bell. In 1810, the King of Spain formally granted the land to Lugo, the land grant was a reward for his military service.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  Lugo also became the mayor of a little town called [[Los Angeles]], from 1816â1819,&lt;ref&gt;http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/foot_prinOn April 6, 2000, the Bell House was dedicated as a California State Historical Resource.ts/Files/lugo_era_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the acreage became known as [[Rancho San Antonio (Lugo)|Rancho San Antonio]]. The grant was confirmed by the Mexican governor in 1838. By 1865, the Lugo family fortune dwindled and most of the Rancho was sold for less than a dollar per acre. The Lugo family did manage to retain its home, built about 1810, and it is the oldest house in Los Angeles County. The original adobe house on Gage Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofbell.org&quot;&gt;www.cityofbell.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1870 and 1890 settlers arrived to the area and among those was the cityâs founder. In 1876, the pioneer residents for whom the city is named, [[James George Bell]] and his wife Susan Abia Hollenbeck Bell, and their two children, Maude Elizabeth and Alphonzo Sr. moved from [[Los Angeles]] where they lived for a short period with Susan's brother, [[John Edward Hollenbeck|John Hollenbeck]], into their Victorian style home â the Bell House, now a historic landmark located at 4401 East Gage Avenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofbell.org&quot;/&gt; On April 6, 2000, the Bell House was dedicated as a California State Historical Resource.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Bell House.jpg|thumb|left|James George Bell House 1876]]
They acquired about {{convert|360|acre|km2|1}} of land and in the next decade, helped in its development as a small farming and cattle raising community. The Bell Family lived at the [[John Edward Hollenbeck|Hollenbeck]]âs âTown Houseâ on 4th and Breed Street until they moved in the âranchâ Bell House in 1876.  The Bell House was an early [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] style farm house. In 1898, the townâs name was changed from Rancho San Antonio, to Bell in honor of its pioneer founders.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofbell.org&quot;/&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century, the Bell area was a sparsely settled countryside with a scattering of houses, including the Bell family's home. Between 1900 and 1915, more people settled into the area. More homes, schools,  churches and a library were built, and several small businesses were established by 1913. The citizens agreed to provide all facilities and services for the library, except for the books.

In the fifteen years following [[World War I]], from 1920 to 1935, an explosive growth in population occurred in the Bell area. Old and new residents built new businesses, established schools, and founded community organizations, such as the Bell [[Chamber of Commerce]] and the Woman's Club. An area-wide sanitation district was formed in 1923 to provide sewer facilities. In 1924, George O. Wheeler founded the ''Industrial Post'', the local newspaper which now serves the communities of Bell, [[Cudahy, California|Cudahy]], and [[Maywood, California|Maywood]]. In 1925, the Alcazar Theater to show &quot;talking pictures&quot;, was opened. It has since been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinematour.com/theatres/us/CA/2.html |title=Cinemas Around the World - United States - California |publisher=CinemaTour |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1926, [[Bell High School (Bell, California)|Bell High School]] was opened.&lt;ref name=&quot;search.lausd.k12.ca.us&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.lausd.k12.ca.us/cgi-bin/fccgi.exe?w3exec=school.profile.content&amp;which=8536 |title=LAUSD School Profile |publisher=Search.lausd.k12.ca.us |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cityhood==
Bell was incorporated as a city in 1927. Since its incorporation, the City of Bell has acquired land for public parks and the recreational program. The city also has constructed an adequate sewer system, widened all major streets, built a [[city hall]], and provided fire department buildings, with the cooperation of Los Angeles County, the city of Maywood and the County Of Los Angeles, the city of Bell constructed an indoor public swimming pool at [[Bell High School (Bell, California)|Bell High School]]. 
[[Image:Bell House2.jpg|thumb|right|James George Bell House]]
The city's Chamber of Commerce is located at the historic [[James George Bell|James George Bell House]], which serves as a meeting place and in addition, a museum showcasing artifacts from the city's founding family and period furniture. The house is open to the general public with free admission.

In March 2007, the city of Bell held its first contested election for city council in almost a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=Bell+CA+election%2C+2007&amp;gwp=13 Bell CA election, 2007: Web Search Results from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The next election for City Council was held in March 2011, and included the recall of  all the city council members save one, who was not re-elected.

===Oscar controversy===
In March 2000, Bell gained worldwide publicity, as the media announced that a shipment of 55 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] statuettes was stolen from a trucking company loading dock in Bell. In addition to the [[Los Angeles]] and Bell police departments, [[FBI]] [[art theft]] experts were investigating. It was the second Oscar mishap, as earlier that month 4,000 ballots were misrouted. Coincidentally, the missing Oscar ballots were found by the post office in a Bell processing center. [[AMPAS]] Executive Director Bruce Davis was quoted as jokingly warning [[Billy Crystal]] (host of that year's Oscar Ceremony) not to go near Bell, because it &quot;seems to be a [[Bermuda Triangle]] for Oscar things.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/03/25/entertainment/main176360.shtml?source=search_story | work=CBS News | title=Waiting For Oscar | date=2000-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 Official-corruption scandal==
{{Main|2010 City of Bell salary controversy}}
In July 2010, when two ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporters, Jeff Gottlieb and Ruben Vives, were investigating possible malfeasance in the neighboring city of [[Maywood, California|Maywood]], it was revealed that Bell city officials were receiving unusually large salaries, perhaps the highest in the nation. The salaries came into the public eye after a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' investigation, based on [[California Public Records Act]] requests, showed the city payroll was swollen with six- to seven-figure salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Rogers |first=John |url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/news_details/article/116/2010/july/27/la-suburb-to-discuss-firing-high-paid-officials.html |title=DA probes voter fraud allegations in Calif. city |publisher=PhillyBurbs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[city manager]] Robert Rizzo  received $787,637 a year (almost double the salary of the [[President of the United States]]).

All but one of the members of the city council were receiving $100,000 for their part-time work, salaries which were authorized by a sparsely attended special election, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/07/bell-council-found-loophole-in-law-to-allow-big-salaries.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A.

Council members in cities similar to Bell in size make an average of $4,800 a year, prosecutors have noted.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt;

In September 2010, the California Attorney General's office filed a lawsuit against eight former and current employees, requesting the return of what the suit calls &quot;excessive salaries&quot; as well a reduction in pension benefits accrued as a result of those higher salaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=CNN Wire Staff|title=California AG sues over California town's municipal salaries|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/09/15/california.bell.lawsuits/|accessdate=16 September 2010|newspaper=CNN|date=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allegations about problems in the 2009 election also have been examined by the [[FBI]] and [[California Secretary of State]] office.&lt;ref&gt;Winton, Richard; Jeff Gottlieb and Andrew Blankstein.

On September 21, 2010, former city manager Robert Rizzo, Mayor Oscar Hernandez, former assistant city manager Angela Spaccia and council members George Mirabal, Teresa Jacobo, Luis Artiga, George Cole and Victor Bello were arrested and charged with misappropriation of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/09/bell-charges-rizzo.html Rizzo faces 53 counts; Bell was 'corruption on steroids,' D.A.

Mayor Oscar Hernandez, Deputy Mayor Teresa Jacobo and Council member George Mirabal, were each recalled with a referendum of over 95%.&lt;ref name=&quot;election&quot;/&gt; Danny Harbor received 62% of the vote to gain Jacobo's seat. Filling the short-term council seat was Ana Maria Quintana with 45% of the vote. The remaining full term council seat was filled by Ali Saleh.

The California Fair Political Practices Commission said July 1, 2011, that it is investigating whether Bell's police union violated state law when the union handed out a campaign flyer supporting their candidates in the [[recall election]].  The commission said it is looking into whether the Bell Police Officers Association was properly noted as the source of the flyer.  Three of the five council persons elected were those endorsed by the Bell Police Officers Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9NTR0K81.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and infrastructure==
The Bell Police Department provides law enforcement for the tiny city of Bell. Police Chief Randy Adams has resigned under pressure and has been replaced. Patrol is part of the Bell Police Department's Field Services Division and is responsible for manning the streets in marked police vehicles. There are 47 members in Bell Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;cityofbell.org&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Bell said they were negotiating with the [[Los Angeles Sheriff's Department]] to take over the policing contract, however, Sheriff Lee Baca's spokesman says that L.A. County 
Auditor-Controller Wendy L. Watanabe, who had suggested that the sheriffs move into Bell, has made no contact with him regarding that possibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2010/12/bell_compton_police_department.php L.A.

==Economy==
Like much  of California,  Bell is in a financial crisis, due to the very public embezzlement scandal. After City Manager Robert Rizzo and the Bell City Council were caught squandering the taxes of their constituents for their own benefit, there is now a giant deficit of several million dollars in the general fund.   An audit by the Los Angeles County auditor-controller found that the city needs to significantly downsize its budget, including the possibility of disbanding the Bell Police Department and contracting with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2010/12/bell_compton_police_department.php&lt;/ref&gt;
