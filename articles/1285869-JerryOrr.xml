'''''Rabbit of Seville''''' is a [[1949]] [[Warner Bros.]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' theatrical [[Animated cartoon|cartoon]] short released in [[1950]]. It was directed by [[Chuck Jones]] and written by [[Michael Maltese]].

The cartoon, in a plotline reminiscent of ''[[Stage Door Cartoon]]'', features [[Bugs Bunny]] being chased by [[Elmer Fudd]] into the stage door of the [[Hollywood Bowl]], whereupon Bugs tricks Elmer into going onstage, and participating in a break-neck operatic production of their chase punctuated with gags and accompanied by musical arrangements by [[Carl Stalling]], focusing on [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] overture to ''[[The Barber of Seville]]''.  

Stalling's arrangement is remarkable in that the overture's basic structure is kept relatively intact; some repeated passages are removed and the overall piece is conducted at a faster tempo to accommodate the cartoon's standard running length. In 1994 it was voted #12 of the [[50 Greatest Cartoons]] of all time by members of the animation field. The cartoon is available on Disc 1 of the [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]].

== Summary ==
The cartoon opens with people filing in to see &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;. In the back of the theater, Bugs is chased by Elmer and runs through an open back door. Elmer, now behind the curtain, doesn't see it rise when Bugs raises the curtain. The conductor, after a brief confused look at his watch, shrugs, then starts the orchestra, which causes Elmer to turn wide-eyed towards the audience. Bugs then steps out from behind a stage door, dressed in a [[barber]]'s outfit and ropes Elmer into getting a shave, rendering him &quot;nice and clean, although [his] face looks like it might have gone through a machine&quot;. 

[[Image:The Rabbit of Seville.png|200px|thumb|left|[[Bugs Bunny]] forces [[Elmer Fudd]] into a barber's chair for a series of outlandish treatments.]]After recovering, Elmer starts the chase again (speaking his only line in the cartoon: &quot;Oh, Wait till I get that wabbit!&quot;), but is stopped by Bugs dressed as a temptress (possibly Rosina from the actual Barber of Seville opera), singing, &quot;what would you want with a rabbit? Can't you see that I'm much sweeter? I'm your little seÃ±orit-er. You're my type of guy, let me straighten your tie, and I shall dance for you.&quot; He then ties Elmer's shotgun into a bowtie (no dialogue is heard from this point onwards until the end) and snips off Elmer's pants suspender buttons . After being thoroughly embarrassed when his pants fall down, Elmer sees through Bugs' disguise, he tries shooting him, but is blown back into the barber's chair. Bugs has another go with Elmer's scalp, beginning with a scalp massage with his hands and feet, turning his head into a fruit salad bowl (complete with cherry on top).  Elmer chases Bugs again, but Bugs plays a snake charmer to get an electric shaver to chase Elmer.  Elmer disables the shaver with a shotgun blast and chases Bugs back to the barber's chairs.  Bugs and Elmer raise their chairs to dizzying heights, and Bugs cuts loose a stage sandbag which bonks Elmer, causing Elmer to wander around in a daze until he's back (yet again) in Bugs' barber chair.  

Before Bugs' third go-round with Elmer's scalp, he gives one of his feet a [[pedicure]] with a can opener, hedge clippers, file and red paint.  This is followed by growing a beard on Elmer's face and shaving it with a miniature mower, and finally a mud masque for the face which Bugs handles like cement.  Then it's back to the scalp as Bugs massages it with hair tonic first, then adds &quot;Figaro Fertilizer&quot;, causing hair to grow from Elmer's head which sprouts into flowers.   A short 'arms chase' ensues as a result where Bugs and Elmer chase each other off stage with bigger weapons (first axes, then guns, then cannons). Finally, Bugs ends the chase by offering flowers, chocolates and a ring to Elmer, who ducks offstage and comes back as the blushing bride. The tune then briefly switches to the &quot;[[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|Wedding March]]&quot; by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]], before finishing with Bugs carrying his 'bride' up a long flight of stairs, through a false doorway (opening up onto thin air), and drops Fudd down into a wedding cake labeled &quot;[[The Marriage of Figaro]]&quot;. Bugs then looks at the camera, smirks, and says in the same way as his catchphrase, &quot;Eh, next!&quot;

== Production details ==
* The ''&quot;Barber of Seville&quot;'' poster that appears at the start of the film features three names: Eduardo Selzeri, Michele Maltese and Carlo Jonzi, which are Italianized versions of the names of the producer ([[Eddie Selzer]]), writer ([[Michael Maltese]]) and director ([[Chuck Jones]]) of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcdb&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon_information/91-Rabbit_Of_Seville.html Rabbit Of Seville Production Information]&quot;. ''bcdb.com'',  March 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* In one shot of the scene where Bugs massages Elmer's head in time to the piano melody, his hands are drawn with five digits instead of the usual four to match the hand of a piano player.&lt;ref name=&quot;bcdb&quot;/&gt;

==Censorship==
*The ABC airing of this cartoon mutes out some of the sound effects of Elmer shooting in the beginning of the cartoon. The shot of Bugs slashing Elmer's face with a razor was also cut by replacing it with a cropped shot of Bugs holding a mirror (which appeared after Elmer got slashed) and grimacing in disgust while the sound of the slashing played as normal. Also cut was the segment where Bugs ties Elmer's gun into a knot. It skips from the shot of Bugs doing a provocative thrust backwards towards the camera to the shot of Elmer being flung back into the barber chair, attempting to suggest some continuity between the two.

==Availability==
The cartoon is available on Disc 1 of the [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1]]

==Trivia==
The cartoon is a spoof of the opening sequence from MGM's [[Broadway Melody of 1938]] (1937) wherein the Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd roles are played by Charles Igor Gorin and future [[MGM]] Tin Man and Beverly Hillbilly, [[Buddy Ebsen]].
