'''dpkg''' is the [[software]] at the base of the [[Debian]] [[package management system]]. &lt;code&gt;dpkg&lt;/code&gt; is used to install, remove, and provide information about [[deb (file format)|.deb]] [[software package (installation)|package]]s.

&lt;code&gt;dpkg&lt;/code&gt; itself is a low level tool; higher level tools, such as [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]], are used to fetch packages from remote locations or deal with complex package relations. Tools like [[Aptitude (program)|aptitude]] or [[synaptic (software)|synaptic]] are more commonly used than &lt;code&gt;dpkg&lt;/code&gt; on its own, as they have a more sophisticated way of dealing with package relationships and a friendlier interface.

The Debian package &quot;dpkg&quot; provides the &lt;code&gt;dpkg&lt;/code&gt; program, as well as several other programs necessary for run-time functioning of the packaging system, including &lt;code&gt;dpkg-statoverride&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dpkg-divert&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;update-alternatives&lt;/code&gt;. It also includes the programs such as start-stop-daemon and install-info, and the latter is kept mostly due to [[backwards compatibility]] (it is developed and distributed separately nowadays). The Debian package &quot;dpkg-dev&quot; includes the numerous build tools described below.

==History==

dpkg was originally created by [[Matt Welsh (computer scientist)|Matt Welsh]], Carl Streeter and [[Ian Murdock]], first as a [[Perl]] program, and then later the main part was rewritten in [[C (programming language)|C]] by [[Ian Jackson]] in 1993. The name ''dpkg'' was originally the short for &quot;Debian package&quot;, but the meaning of that phrase has evolved significantly, as dpkg the software is orthogonal to the [[deb (file format)|deb package format]] as well as the Debian Policy which defines how Debian packages behave.

==Example use==

To install a .deb package:
 dpkg -i ''debFileName''

where ''debFileName'' is the name of the Debian software package.

The list of installed packages can be obtained with:
 dpkg -l ''[optional pattern]''

To remove an installed package:
 dpkg -r ''packagename''

== Development tools ==
dpkg-dev contains a series of development tools required to unpack, build and upload Debian source packages. These include:
*'''dpkg-source''' packs and unpacks the source files of a Debian package.
*'''dpkg-gencontrol''' reads the information from an unpacked Debian tree source and generates a binary package control package, creating an entry for this in Debian/files.
*'''dpkg-shlibdeps''' calculates the dependencies of runs with respect to libraries.
*'''dpkg-genchanges''' reads the information from an unpacked Debian tree source that once constructed creates a control file (.changes).
*'''dpkg-buildpackage''' is a control script that can be used to construct the package automatically.
*'''dpkg-distaddfile''' adds a file input to debian/files.
*'''dpkg-parsechangelog''' reads the changes file (changelog) of an unpacked Debian tree source and creates a conveniently prepared output with the information for those changes.
