It was suppressed under the [[British Raj]], but has been reconstructed since [[India]] gained independence.

It is particularly distinguished from other [[Indian classical dance|classical Indian dance]] forms by the importance it places upon the ''[[Tribhangi]]'' (literally: three parts break), the independent movement of head, chest and pelvis&lt;ref&gt;[http://chandrakantha.com/articles/indian_music/nritya/odissi.html Article by David Courtney retrieved July 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hi&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Sunil |title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism: (H - Q).|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=wNQ82_yYeK8C&amp;pg=PA868&amp;dq=Tribhanga&amp;ct=result#v=onepage&amp;q=Tribhanga&amp;f=false|year=1999|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=8176250643|page=868}}&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the basic square stance known as ''Chauka'' or ''Chouka'' that symbolizes [[Jagannath|Lord Jagannath]]. This dance is characterized by various '''Bhangas''' (Stance), which involves stamping of the foot and striking various postures as seen in Indian sculptures. The common '''Bhangas''' are ''Bhanga'', ''Abanga'', ''Atibhanga'' and ''Tribhanga''.

==Origin and History==
[[File:Temple-Jagannath.jpg|thumb|170px|Temple rituals of [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]], included Orissi.]]
The first clear picture of Orissi dance is found in the Manchapuri cave in [[Udayagiri (Orissa)|Udayagiri]] which was carved during the time of Emperor [[Kharavela]]. Flanked by two queens, Emperor [[Kharavela]] was watching a dance recital where a damsel was performing a dance in front of the court along with the company of female instrumentalists. Thus, Orissi can be traced back to its origin as secular dance. Later it got attached with the temple culture of Orissa. Starting with the rituals of [[Jagannath temple]] in [[Puri]] it was regularly performed in [[Shaivite]], [[Vaishnavite]] and [[Sakta]] temples in Orissa. An inscription is found where it was engraved that a [[Devadasi]] Karpursriâs attachment to [[Buddhist monastery]], where she was performing along with her mother and grandmother. It proves that Orissi  first originated as a court dance. Later, it was performed in all religious places of [[Jainism]] as well as [[Buddhist]] monasteries. Orissi was initially performed in the temples as a religious offering by the Maharis who dedicated their lives in the services of God. It has the closest resemblance with sculptures of the Indian temples.&lt;ref name=&quot;nadanam.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nadanam.com/odissi/o_index.htm Orissi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Orissi dance has been traced to an early sculptures found in the Ranigumpha caves at [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udaygiri]] (Orissa), dating to the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; century BCE. Orissi appears to be the oldest classical dance rooted in rituals and tradition. In fact, the [[Natya Shastra]] refers to ''Odra-Magadhi'' as one of the '''Vrittis''' and '''Odra''' refers to Orissa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nadanam.com/odissi/o_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temple history===
In [[Bhubaneswar]], the capital city of [[Orissa]], [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves|Udayagiri Caves, Khandagiri Caves]] and [[Jain]] Caves are present which date back to the 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; century BCE, that served as a royal palace for Emperor [[Kharavela]]. It is suggested by scholars that Orissi is archaeologically the oldest Indian classical dance form due to sculptural evidence found in the caves. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians are in [[Konark Sun Temple]] and [[Brahmeswara]] temple in [[Bhubaneswar]].

In the excavated ruins of the Buddhist [[Ratnagiri (Orissa)|Ratnagiri]] hills in Orissa, dating back to the 6&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; thru 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, several panels and icons of dance are found resembling present-day Orissi dance.

In the [[Tantra|Tantric]] temples, such as the Hirapur Shrine, many of the [[yogini]]s especially are depicted in poses reminiscent of present day Orissi. When [[Orissa]] became a big centre of worship of Lord [[Shiva]], it is only natural that dance would be used as a form of worship, since Lord Shiva was a master dancer himself. He is also known as '''[[Nataraja|Nataraj]]''', the Cosmic Lord of Dance. The [[Shaivite]] temples of [[Bhubaneswar]] display innumerable sculptures in postures of Orissi. The [[Vaishnavite]] Temples such as [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]] and [[Konark Sun Temple]] abound with an array of dancing sculptures carved into the temple walls, giving testimony that a particular school of dancing had continued from the [[Shaivite]] art tradition to the [[Vaishnavite]] art form.

===Manuscript evidence===
Sage Bharata's ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', written in 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; century CE, speaks of four types of '''Pravrittis''' (local usages): ''Avanti, Dakshinatya, Panchali'', and ''Odra Magadhi'', and the areas where each type is employed. Some scholars have interpreted that ''Odra Magadhi'' is &quot;the earliest literary reference&quot; to Orissi.

''Abhinaya Chandrika'' written by Maheshvara Mahapatra is a detailed study of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the KaranÃ£s mentioned in ''NÃ£tyaShÃ£stra''.

The illustrated manuscript ''ShilpaprakÃ£sha'' deals with Oriya architecture and sculpture as well as the figures of dance. In this, one finds a elaborate analysis of the manner in which the salabhanjikÃ£s or the feminine figures called the ''Alasa Kanyas'' are carved in the temple. The illustrations of ''ShilpaprakÃ£sha'' reinforces the evidence of sculpture in temples.

A rather unexpected source, the Jain Manuscripts, especially the ''Kalpasutra'' and ''Kalkacharya KathÃ£s'' show traces of Oriya dance style although they were being executed in [[Gujarat]]. The marginal figures of dancers show women in poses and movements similar to the distinctive style of Orissi. For example, in one of the famous illustrated Jain Manuscripts called the ''Devasanpada Kalpasutra'' (1501, [[Jamnagar]]), there is depiction of the ''Samapada'', the ''Tribhangi'' and the ''Chuaka''.

This shows that there was a great deal of mobility between east and west and many migrations took place. According to some historians, there were groups of dancers who were brought to [[Puri]] from [[Gujarat]] and [[Andhra]].

===Mughal and British period===
During the Mughal rule of India, the duties of the maharis (the temple dancers) shifted, as they were employed to entertain the royal family and courtiers in the royal courts. They became associated with concubinage in respect to the king and ceased to be respected solely as servants to Lord [[Jagannath]]. Although the British have helped India in several ways, a decline and degradation occurred in all the Indian Classical dance styles during the British period, especially when a bill was passed prohibiting temple dancing. Most of these dancers, losing their well-deserved place in society, were forced to prostitution to survive in the changing climate of political and cultural oppression of the British.

==Tradition and dancers==
[[File:Nandini Ghosal.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Orissi dancer]]
The Orissi tradition existed in three schools: ''Mahari, Nartaki'', and ''Gotipua''. 

* '''Maharis''' were Oriya [[devadasi]]s or temple girls, their name deriving from ''Maha'' (great) and âNariâ or âMahriâ (chosen) particularly those at the temple of [[Jagganath]] at [[Puri]]. Early Maharis performed mainly '''Nritta''' (pure dance) and '''[[Abhinaya]]''' (interpretation of poetry) based on '''[[Mantra]]s''' and '''[[Sloka]]s'''. Later, Maharis especially performed dance sequences based on the lyrics of [[Jayadev]]'s ''[[Gita Govinda]]''. ''Bhitari Gauni Maharis'' were allowed in the inner temple while ''Bahari Gauni Maharis'', though in the temples, were excluded from the ''sanctum sanctorum.''
* By the 6th century the '''Gotipua''' tradition was emerging. One of the reasons given for the emergence of Gotipuas is that [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavas]] did not approve of dancing by women. Gotipuas were boys dressed up as girls and taught the dance by the Maharis. During this period, [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] poets composed innumerable lyrics in [[Oriya language|Oriya]] dedicated to [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]]. Gotipuas danced to these compositions. The Gotipuas stepped out of the precincts of the temples.
* '''Nartaki''' dance took place in the royal courts, where it was much cultivated before the British period. At that time the misuse of devadasis came under strong attack, so that Orissi dance withered in the temples and became unfashionable at court. Only the remnants of the gotipua school remained, and the reconstruction of the style required an archaeological and anthropological effort that has tended to foster a conservative purism.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandra Lopez y Royo, &quot;The reinvention of odissi classical dance as a temple ritual,&quot; published in ''The Archaeology of Ritual'' ed. Evangelos Kyriakidis, Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, UCLA 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mahari tradition===
The consecration of females to the service of temple dancing began in the Shaivite temples and continued in the Jagannath temple in service of the Lord Jagannath. These attendants have been known as maharis (great women) or devadasis (servants of the lord) and have been considered the wives of Lord Jagannath. Orissi developed through their art.

The first evidence of the Mahari institution in Orissa comes from a commemorative inscription by Udyota Kesari, the last King of the dynasty. In the 10th century the Kingâs mother, Kolavati Devi, dedicated temple dancers to Lord Shiva in the Brahmeswar Temple.

Raja Anantavarma Chodagangadeva appointed dancing girls for ritual services in the Jagannatha temple in the 11th century, and these Maharis were the ones responsible for keeping the dance alive for centuries.
Through the technique of unequal division of weight and firm footwork balancing a fluid upper torso, the dancer achieves a sensuality that is uncommon in other classical dance styles. 

Some eminent Mahari dancers are Moni Mahari, Dimmi (Domi) Mahari,  Dungri Mahari (Harapriya), and Padmashri Guru Pankaj Charan Das.

===Gotipua tradition===
In the Oriya language Gotipua means ''single boy''. Gotipua dance is performed only by boys who dress up as females. 

During the rule of King Prataprudra Dev, who was a follower of Sri Chaitanya, started this boy dancing tradition again as Vasishnavs were not approving of the females in to dance practices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orissadiary.com/orissa_profile/dance/Gotipua%20Dance.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dance vocabulary and repertoire==
[[Image:Rudrakshya 019.jpg|thumb|right|Orissi group performance]]

[[Image:Odissi in a Group.jpg|thumb|right|Orissi group performance]]
Traditional Orissi repertoire consists of:

;Mangalacharana: An invocation piece. After paying homage to Lord [[Jagannath]] a '''[[shloka|sloka]]''' (hymn) in praise of some God or Goddess is sung, the meaning of which is brought out through dance. Mangalacharan also includes the '''''Bhumi Pranam''''' (salutation to Mother Earth) which is offered to Mother Earth as a way of begging forgiveness for stamping on her and the '''''Trikhandi Pranam''''' or the Three-fold salutation - above the head to the Gods, in front of the face to the Gurus and in front of the chest to the Audience.

;Battu Nrutya: Also known as '''Sthayee Nrutya''' or '''Batuka Bhairava''' (Furious Dance) it is performed in the honor of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]- the cosmic Lord of Dance. It is one of the 64 furious-aspects of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] known. The origin of dance is believed to be from [[Tantrism]] that had flourished in [[Orissa]]. ''Linga Purana'' and ''Mahanirvanatantra'' give an elaborate description of '''Batuka Bhairava''' in three aspects, and the results of their worship have also been explained elaborately in the texts. '''Batu Nrutya''' is an item of pure '''Nrutya''' (Dance)and remains the most difficult item of Orissi dance. The dance begins with a series of sculpturesque poses depicting such actions as the playing of a '''Veena''' (Lute), '''Mardala''' or '''[[Pakhavaj|Pakhawaj]]''' (Drum), '''Karatala''' (Cymbals) and '''Venu''' (Flute), that brings out the interrelationships between this dance and the dance sculptures adorning the temples of Orissa. These poses are stringed together with steps in different rhythms. There is no song or recitation accompanying the dance, but throughout the item a refrain of rhythmic syllables is provided. The accompanying refrain   is in the form of one line of '''Ukuta''' and as this is recited in the '''[[Tala (music)|Tala]]''', different '''Jathi'''-patterns are improvised and are executed with the feet. Some '''[[Tala (music)|Tala]]''' variations are introduced and each sequence of the dance terminates with a '''Tehdi''' known as '''Katam'''. The last sequence is always in ''Jhula Pahapata Tala'' and is performed with a fast tempo.

;Pallavi: A pure dance item in which a [[raga]] is elaborated through eye movements, body postures &amp; intricate footwork. Pallavi literally means âblossomingâ. This is applicable not only to the dance, but also to the music, which accompanies it. Pallavi starts with slow, graceful &amp; lyrical movements of the eyes, neck, torso &amp; feet &amp; slowly builds in a crescendo to climax in a fast tempo at the end. Both the dance and the music evolve in complexity as the dancer traces multiple patterns in space, interpreting the music dexterously in the multilayered dimensions of taal (rhythm) and laya (speed).

;Abhinaya: An expressional dance which is an enactment of a song or poetry, where a story conveyed to the audience through '''[[mudra]]s''' (hand gestures), facial expression, eye movement and body movement. The dance is fluid, very graceful, and sensual. Abhinaya can be performed on verses in [[Sanskrit]] or [[Oriya language|Oriya]] language. The verses are extremely ornate in content and suggestion. Most common are Abhinayas on ''Oriya songs'' or ''Sanskrit Ashthapadis'' or ''Sanskrit stutis'' like ''Dasavatar Stotram'' (depicting the ten incarnations of [[Vishnu|Lord Vishnu]]) or ''[[Ardhanari]] Stotram''. Most of the Abhinaya compositions are based on the Radha-Krishna theme. The Astapadis of the kÃ£vya ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' written by the Saint Jayadev are an integral part of its repertoire. The beginning pieces are dedicated to [[Jagannath|Lord Jagannatha]] - an incarnation of Lord Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nadanam.com/odissi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

;Dance drama: Usually longer than Abhinaya and typically performed by more than one dancers. Some of the much appreciated dance dramas composed by Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra are: Sudama Dharitra Bhanjana, Mathamani Pradhana, Balya Leela, Rutu Samhara, Krishna Sudama, Dushmanta Sakuntala, Utkala Mauda Mani, Yagnaseni, Meghadoot, Kumara Sambhava, Sapan Nayaka. Usually Hindu mythologies are chosen as themes, but experimenting with the theme and form in recent years have led to extremely unique creations. Some worth-mentioning themes in recent years are Panchakanya, Ganga yamuna, Shrita kamalam, Mrutyuh and Tantra.

;Moksha: The concluding item of a recital. Moksha means âspiritual liberationâ. This dance represents a spiritual culmination for the dancer who soars into the realm of pure aesthetic delight. Movement and pose merge to create ever new patterns, ever new designs in space and time. The dance moves onto a crescendo that is thrilling to both, the eye and the ear. With the cosmic sound of the âOmâ, the dance dissolves into nothingness â just like Moksha or the deliverance of the soul in real life.

==Orissi terminology==
[[image:Sharmila Biswas, Odissi dancer.jpg|thumb|right|Sharmila Biswas performing Orissi in a dance festival in Kerala]]

;Alap: It is the opening section of a typical  Indian classical performance. It is unmetered, improvised (within the [[raga]]) and unaccompanied (except for the drone of the [[Tanpura]]), and is started at a slow tempo.
;Anadha: Hide category of the 4 musical divisions, e.g. Mardala or [[Pakhavaj|Pakhawaj]] (Drum), [[Tabla]], and [[Mridangam]].
;Asanjukta Dhvanis: Sound created by striking the Mardala or [[Pakhavaj|Pakhawaj]] (Drum) with one hand.
;Avartan(a): One complete cycle of a taal.
;Bani: Orissi term used to describe the spoken drum neumonics. During dance performances Bani are spoken by the percussionist or the guru.
;Bhaga: In taal, this would be the groups the taal is divided into. Also the points on which the tali, or khali would be. e.g., Adital (Orissi) is divided into 4 groups of 4 beats. It is said that Adital has 4 Bhago. These are the measures. Orissi music term.
;Bhajan: It is any type of Indian devotional song. It has no fixed form: it may be as simple as a ''[[Mantra]]'' or ''[[Kirtan]]'' or as sophisticated as the ''[[Dhrupad]]'' or ''[[Kriti]]'' with music based on classical ''[[Raga]]s'' and ''[[Tala (music)|Talas]]''. It is normally lyrical, expressing love for the Divine.
;Chanda: In tal, this would be how the divisions of the tal are divided. e.g., in Adital (Orissi), the sixteen beats are divided into 4 groups of 4. So the Chanda for Adital is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4. This describes what the Bhagas are.
;Devadasis: They were the original temple dancers who were &quot;Servitress of God&quot;. They were dedicated to a deity or a temple. Apart from taking care of the temple and performing various rituals, these women learned and practiced Orissi dance, for dance and music were an essential part of temple worship. They enjoyed a high social status.
;[[Gita Govinda]]: [[Jayadeva|Poet Jayadev's]] famous work depicting the relationship of [[Radha]], [[Krishna]] and [[Gopi]]s in [[Vrindavan]]. Themes from this work have a great significance towards the classical arts of [[India]].
;Goti: These are barrel-shaped tension pegs made of wood which adorn the Mardala or [[Pakhavaj|Pakhawaj]] (Drum). The straps ('''Pitha''') connecting the two apertures of the Mardala run over them. These pegs can be moved to either increase or decrease the tension of the leather membranes covering the two apertures of the Mardala and are useful in tuning it.
;Gotipua: Young boys trained in the fine art of Orissi dance. The Gotipuas were allowed to leave the temple and dance for the public. The current form of Orissi is heavily influenced by the Gotipua tradition (and also the temple carvings from Orissa.)
;Khanda Ukutta: When bani and ukuttas are formed together to make phrases. e.g., Kititaka gadigana. Orissi term.
;Mana: The ending sequence that is repeated to designate that the ending of the piece or of a section. Typically in 3 repeats. Orissi term. People in Orissa inter change Tihai and Mano. But they mean the same.
;Maharis or Devadasis: The original temple dancers of Orissa, but now extinct. This is the root of Orissi dance that was later taught to young boys, Gotipuas. The style is now modernized and work is being done to preserve it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mardala.com/theory/terms/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orissi music==
{{Main|Orissi music}}

Orissi dance is accompanied by [[Orissi music]], a synthesis of four classes of music,&lt;ref name=&quot;orissaculture.gov.in&quot;&gt;http://orissaculture.gov.in/dance.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orissatourism.net&quot;&gt;http://www.orissatourism.net/dance-music.html&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. '''Dhruvapada''', '''Chitrapada''', '''Chitrakala''' and '''[[Panchal]]'''. The '''Dhruvapada''' is the first line or lines to be sung repeatedly. '''Chitrapada''' means the arrangement of words in an alliterative style. The use of art in music is called '''Chitrakala'''. ''Kavisurya Baladeva Rath'', the renowned Oriya poet wrote lyrics, which are the best examples of '''Chitrakala'''. All of these were combined to form the style that's peculiar to Orissi music. 

'''Chhanda''' (metrical section) contains the essence of Orissi music. The '''Chhandas''' were composed by combining '''Bhava''' (theme), '''Kala''' (time), and '''Swara''' (tune). The '''Chaurisha''' represents the originality of Orissi style. All the thirty four (34) letters of the Oriya alphabet from ''''''Ka'''''' to ''''''Ksha'''''' are used chronologically at the beginning of each line. 

A special feature of Orissi music is the '''padi''' which consists of words to be sung in '''Druta Tala''' (fast beat). Orissi music can be sung to different [[Tala (music)|talas]]: '''Navatala''' (nine beats), '''Dashatala''' (ten beats) or '''Egartala''' (eleven beats). Orissi [[raga]]s are different from the ragas of Hindustani and Karnataki classical  music. The primary Orissi ragas&lt;ref name=&quot;orissaculture.gov.in&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orissatourism.net&quot;/&gt; are '''Kalyana''', '''Nata''', '''Shree Gowda''', '''Baradi''', '''Panchama''', '''Dhanashri''', '''Karnata''', '''Bhairavee''' and '''Shokabaradi'''.

Orissi music is sung through '''Raganga''', '''Bhabanga''' and '''Natyanga Dhrubapadanga''' followed by '''Champu''', '''Chhanda''', '''Chautisa''', '''[[Pallabi]]''', '''[[Bhajan]]''', '''Janana''', and '''[[Gita Govinda]]''', which are considered to be a part of the repertoire of Orissi or an allied act form of Orissi.

Orissi music has codified grammars, which are presented with specific Raagas. It has also a distinctive rendition style. It is lyrical in its movement with wave-like ornamentation. The pace of singing in Orissi is not very fast nor too slow, and it maintains a proportional tempo which is very soothing.

==Costume and Jewelry==
''See also: [[Tarakashi]] and [[Sambalpuri Saree]]''

The jewelry is made from intricate filigree silver jewelry pieces. [[Filigree]], in French, means âthin wire,â and in Oriya it is called '''Tarakasi'''. This highly skilled art form is more than 500 years old and is traditionally done by local artisans on the eastern shores of Orissa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.odissivilas.org/costumes.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The jewelry pieces themselves are an important part of the Orissi dancerâs costume.  They are the '''[[tikka]]''' (forehead ornament), '''allaka''' (head piece on which the tikka hangs), unique ear covers in intricate shapes, usually depicting a peacockâs feathers, with '''jimkis''' (bell shaped earrings) hanging from them, two necklaces- a smaller necklace worn close to the neck and a longer necklace with a hanging pendant, and two sets of bangles worn on the upper arm and wrist. The process of creating each piece takes the collaboration of many artisans each specialized in one step of the many that turns a lump of raw silver into a handcrafted work of art.

===Head piece===
The crown or '''''Mukoot''''' or '''''Mookut''''', worn by the Orissi dancer is made only in the devotional city of [[Puri]] in Eastern Orissa. It is formed from the dried reeds called '''''Sola''''' in a tradition called '''''Sola Kama'''''. The reed is carved by a series of cuts into the rod-like stem and forms various types of flowers when a string is tied in the middle of the rod and pulled tight. As the string is tightened, the flowers shape into Jasmines, Champa (one of the five flowers of Lord Krishnaâs arrows), and Kadamba (the flowers of the tree under which Radha would wait for her beloved Lord Krishna).

The '''Mukoot''' consists of two parts i.e. '''''Ghoba''''' and '''''Tahiya'''''. The flower decorated back piece, called the '''''Ghoba''''', sits around the dancerâs hair pulled into a bun at the back of the head. This piece represents the [[Lotus Flower|Lotus]] flower with a thousand petals that lies above the head in the head Chakra, or energy center. The longer piece that emerges from the center of the back piece is called the '''''Tahiya''''', and this represents the temple spire of Lord [[Jagannath]] or the [[flute]] of Lord [[Krishna]].

The [[Saree]] worn by Orissi dancers are generally coloured with bright shades of orange, purple, red or green. This [[Saree]] features traditional prints of [[Orissa]] and shiny embellishment. This costume is drapped around the body in unique traditional way unlike other classical dance forms of India. Generally [[Sambalpuri Saree]] is being used in Orissi dance more than any other type of Sarees. The makeup of an Orissi dancer includes [[Bindi (decoration)|Bindi]] (red dot), applied on the forehead with a pattern made from sandalwood around it, [[Kajal]] (black eyeliner), applied around the eyes with a broad outline to give them an elongated look, among others.

==Orissi gurus and performers==
[[Padma Vibushan]] [[Kelucharan Mohapatra]], Guru Pankaj Charan Das, Guru Deba Prasad Das and Guru Raghunath Dutta were the four major gurus who revived Orissi in the late forties and early fifties. [[Sanjukta Panigrahi]], the great exponent of Orissi, was a leading disciple of Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra's and popularized Orissi by performing extensively, both in India and abroad. In the mid-sixties, two other disciples of Kelucharan Mohapatra, Kumkum Mohanty and [[Sonal Mansingh]], were best known for their performances, both in India and abroad. Shrimati Laximipriya Mohapatra performed a piece of Orissi abhinaya in the Annapurna Theatre in Cuttack in 1948. This is widely upheld as the first ever performance of a classical Orissi dance item after its contemporary revival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100809/jsp/orissa/story_12788878.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; [[Padma Shri]] [[Mayadhar Raut]] also played a major role in giving Orissi dance its classical status. He introduced ''Mudra Vinyoga'' in 1955 and ''Sancharibhava'' in the Orissi dance items, and presented on stage the enchanting ''[[Gita Govinda]] Ashthapadis'', portraying ''Shringara Rasa''. His notable compositions include ''Pashyati Dishi Dishi'' and ''Priya Charu Shile'', composed in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Odissi Yaatra : The Journey of Guru Mayadhar Raut'', by Aadya Kaktikar (ed. Madhumita Raut) Publisher: B.R. Rhythms, Delhi,2010.  ISBN 978-8-18-882721-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://orissadiary.com/personality/artist/Padmashri-Guru-Mayadhar-Raut.asp Orissa Diary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the present day gurus were Gotipua dancers themselves, and have trained dancers and teachers all over India and abroad. In the early fifties, the outside world began to take note of Orissi. Priyambada Mohanty Hejmadi and Dr. Susama Tej represented Orissa in the classical dance category at the Inter University Youth Festival, New Delhi, in 1954 and 1955. It was here that Dr. Charles Fabri witnessed their performances, hailed Orissi as a great classical dance form, and helped [[Indrani Rehman]] and [[Sonal Mansingh]] study it. Sadly, Priyambada Mohanty Hejmadi left for the US for 16 long years, where she hardly performed, barring a recital or two here and there. She returned to India only in the mid-nineteen seventies, by which time well known dancers had already occupied a permanent and prominent space on the Orissi horizon, and by which time Orissi had evolved considerably. The baton in India was wielded gloriously, and with outstanding success and public acclaim, by Sanjukta Panigrahi, Kumkum Mohanty and Sonal Mansingh, each of whom was a major and distinctive star.
