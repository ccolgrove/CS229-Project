'''Disney Channel''' is a children's television channel owned by the [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] broadcast in [[Hungary]]. It was previously known as '''[[Fox Kids]]''', and later as '''[[Jetix]]'''.

==History==
The channel has launched on November 2000 as Fox Kids.
On April 18, 2004, Fox Kids launched Jetix as a programming block, and later, on January 1, 2005, as a TV channel, replacing Fox Kids.
On August 11, 2008 Jetix started broadcasting a block of &quot;Disney stars&quot;, featuring the series [[Kim Possible]], [[Phineas and Ferb]], [[American Dragon: Jake Long|American Dragon]], [[Hannah Montana]] and later [[Wizards of Waverly Place]].
After [[Disney XD]] successfully launched on February 13, 2009 in the US, the [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] has started re-branding Jetixes in all countries. However, in certain countries ( including Hungary ), Jetix was replaced by Disney Channel, marking that channel's first introduction in these countries. The change happened on September 19, 2009. On June 1, 2011, Playhouse Disney was replaced by Disney Junior.

Disney Channel Czech Republic and Hungary are broadcasts like a single video feed with two different audio channels for each language. At the commercial break ident it shows both Czech and Hungarian words for &quot;COMMERCIALS&quot;:&quot;REKLAMA&quot;, then &quot;REKLÃM, unlike on Disney Channel Romania &amp; Bulgaria, where it shows just &quot;RECLAME&quot;.
