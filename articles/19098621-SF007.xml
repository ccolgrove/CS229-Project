'''''Stolen''''' is a [[stealth-based game]] developed by [[United Kingdom|British]] video game company Blue 52 and published in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] by Hip Games for [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. 

== Story ==

The player assumes the role of Anya Romanov, an [[acrobatics|acrobatic]], high-tech professional [[Theft|thief]] living in the futuristic dark metropolis Forge City. Her initial mission is to infiltrate a high-security museum and steal items therein. She is assisted by the computer expert Louie Palmer, who communicates with her through an [[earpiece]]. Later on however Anya is framed for murder she didn't commit and finds out about a sinister [[conspiracy fiction|conspiracy]] involving a ruthless [[political corruption|corrupt politician]] Richard Killian and her own deadly [[female ninja]] rival known only as Breeze.

== Gameplay ==

Anya has several hi-tech [[gadget]]s to assist her, including [[Night vision device|night vision goggles]] and a multi-use [[Tranquilliser gun|dart gun]]. Notably, Anya has no lethal arms at her disposal: because of her personal moral code the player cannot kill any of the guards and other enemies she encounters, and can only knock them [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] for a brief moment. According to the [[IGN]] review, &quot;it's clear that the developers have played ''[[Splinter Cell]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' games, but they haven't learned how to make it all that interesting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.xbox.ign.com/articles/606/606095p2.html |title=IGN review of ''Stolen'' on the Xbox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GameSpot]] review mentioned the game's &quot;''[[Prince of Persia]]''-inspired feats&quot;, however &quot;the only difficult part about Stolen is finding the patience to actually remain hidden when it's easier to just charge through the levels.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespot&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/adventure/stolen/review.html |title=GameSpot review of ''Stolen''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

While ''Stolen'' received little press coverage, that which it did receive was mostly poor ([[GameRankings]] average scores of 52.89% for the PC version, 56.43% for the PS2 version, and 54.42% for the Xbox version). IGN reviewer called the game's action &quot;incredibly uninspired&quot;, concluding that &quot;it's a game like this that truly makes one appreciate all the other stealth games on the market.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot; /&gt;
