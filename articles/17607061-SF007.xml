[[File:Wi-Fi Logo.svg|thumb|Wi-Fi logo]]

'''Wi-Fi''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|w|aÉª|f|aÉª}}) or '''''Wifi''''', is a mechanism for wirelessly connecting electronic devices. A device enabled with Wi-Fi, such as a personal computer, video game console, [[smartphone]], or digital audio player, can connect to the [[Internet]] via a [[wireless network]] access point. An [[Wireless access point|access point]] (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) has a range of about 20 meters (65&amp;nbsp;ft) indoors and a greater range outdoors.  Multiple overlapping access points can cover large areas.

A Wi-Fi enabled device such as a PC, video game console, mobile phone, MP3 player or PDA can connect to the Internet when within range of a wireless network connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected access points â called a hotspot â can comprise an area as small as a single room with wireless-opaque walls or as large as many square miles covered by overlapping access points. &quot;Wi-Fi&quot; is a [[trademark]] of the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] and the brand name for products using the [[IEEE 802.11]] family of standards. Wi-Fi is used by over 700 million people. There are over four million [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]s (places with Wi-Fi Internet connectivity) around the world, and about 800 million new Wi-Fi devices are sold every year.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  Wi-Fi products that complete Wi-Fi Alliance [[interoperability]] certification testing successfully may use the &quot;Wi-Fi CERTIFIED&quot; designation and trademark.

==How it works==
''This section is a [[Wikipedia:Stub#Ideal_stub_article|stub]].  You can help Wikipedia by [{{SERVER}}{{localurl:{{NAMESPACE}}:{{PAGENAME}}|action=edit&amp;section=1}} expanding it]
''

==Uses==
To connect to a Wi-Fi LAN, a computer has to be equipped with a [[wireless network interface controller]]. The combination of computer and interface controller is called a ''station''. All stations share a single radio frequency communication channel. Transmissions on this channel are received by all stations within range. The hardware does not signal the user that the transmission was delivered and is therefore called a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. A carrier wave is used to transmit the data in packets, referred to as &quot;[[Ethernet frame]]s&quot;. Each station is constantly tuned in on the radio frequency communication channel to pick up available transmissions.

===Internet access===
A Wi-Fi-enabled device, such as a [[personal computer]], video game console, smartphone or digital audio player, can connect to the Internet when within range of a [[wireless network]] connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more (interconnected) [[Wireless access point|access points]]âcalled hotspotsâcomprises an area as small as a few rooms or as large as many square miles. Coverage in the larger area may depend on a group of access points with overlapping coverage. Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London, UK, for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6577307.stm |title= Switch on for Square Mile wi-fi |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2007-11-08 | date=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wi-Fi provides service in private homes and offices as well as in public spaces at Wi-Fi hotspots set up either free-of-charge or commercially. Organizations and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free-use hotspots to attract or assist clients. Enthusiasts or authorities who wish to provide services or even to promote business in selected areas sometimes provide free Wi-Fi access. {{As of|2008}} more than 300 city-wide Wi-Fi ([[Municipal wireless network|Muni-Fi]]) projects had been created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muniwireless.com/initiatives/2008/01/02/7483/ |title=MuniWireless &quot; City Initiatives Directory |publisher=www.muniwireless.com |accessdate=2008-03-12}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of| 2010}} the [[Czech Republic]] had 1150 Wi-Fi based [[wireless Internet service provider]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Router (computing)|Router]]s that incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, often set up in homes and other buildings, provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] to all devices tuned into them, wirelessly or via cable. With the emergence of [[MiFi]] and [[WiBro]] (a portable Wi-Fi router) people can easily create their own Wi-Fi hotspots that connect to Internet via [[cellular network]]s. Now [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Bada (operating system)|Bada]] and [[Symbian]] phones can create wireless connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mifi vs Joikuspot|url=http://www.mificlub.com/2010/07/mifi-vs-joikuspot/|publisher=mificlub.com|accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also connect Wi-Fi devices in [[Wireless ad hoc network|ad-hoc mode]] for client-to-client connections without a router. Wi-Fi also connects places normally without network access, such as kitchens and garden sheds.

====City-wide Wi-Fi====
{{See|Municipal wireless network}}
[[File:Metro Wireless Node.jpg|thumb|An outdoor Wi-Fi access point]]

In the early 2000s, many cities around the world announced plans to construct city-wide Wi-Fi networks.  Doing so proved to be more difficult than envisioned, and as a result most of these projects were either cancelled or placed on indefinite hold.  A few were successful; for example, in 2005 [[Sunnyvale, California]], became the first city in the United States to offer city-wide free Wi-Fi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunnyvale Uses MetroFi |url=http://www.unstrung.com/document.asp?doc_id=85119&amp;WT.svl=wire1_1|publisher=unstrung.com|accessdate=2008-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Minneapolis]] has generated $1.2 million in profit annually for [[Minneapolis wireless internet network|its provider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|Alexander, Steve and Brandt, Steve|title=Minneapolis moves ahead with wireless|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/111286134.html|date=December 5, 2010|publisher=The Star Tribune|accessdate=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Unless it is particular notable, this is not the place to list every municipal Wi-Fi. --&gt;

In 2004, [[Mysore]] became India's first Wi-fi-enabled city and second in the world after Jerusalem. A company called WiFiyNet has set up hotspots in Mysore, covering the complete city and a few nearby villages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060820/asp/opinion/story_6632793.asp The Telegraph - Say hello to India's first wirefree city]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, London, UK, Mayor Boris Johnson pledged to have London-wide Wi-Fi by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/8692103.stm |accessdate=2010-05-19 | work=BBC News | title=London-wide wi-fi by 2012 pledge | date=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Islington in London&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.govtech.com/dc/118717 |title= City of London Fires Up Europe's Most Advanced Wi-Fi Network |publisher=www.govtech.com |accessdate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/networking/2005/04/18/london-gets-a-mile-of-free-wi-fi-39195421/|title= London gets a mile of free Wi-Fi|publisher=.zdnet.co.uk|accessdate=200-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  already has extensive outdoor Wi-Fi coverage.

====Campus-wide Wi-Fi====
Many traditional college campuses provide at least partial wireless Wi-Fi Internet coverage.
[[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]] at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author= Deb Smit |title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story  |publisher= Pop City Media |date= October 5, 2011|url = http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx |accessdate= October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year= 2007 | url = http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate= October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1= Wolter Lemstra |author2= [[Vic Hayes]] |author3= John Groenewegen |title=The innovation journey of Wi-Fi: the road to global success |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&amp;pg=PA121|page=121 |accessdate=October 6, 2011 |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521199711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Drexel University]] in Philadelphia became the United States's first major university to offer completely wireless Internet access across its entire campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drexel.edu/catalog/general/aboutuniversity.htm |title=About the University |publisher=Drexel.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct computer-to-computer communications===
Wi-Fi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary. This is called ''ad hoc'' Wi-Fi transmission. This [[wireless ad hoc network]] mode has proven popular with [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[handheld game console]]s, such as the [[Nintendo DS]], [[digital camera]]s, and other [[consumer electronics]] devices.

The disadvantage of this method is that vendors must not implement speeds greater than 11 Mbit/s(802.11b)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://labs.pcw.co.uk/2005/03/adhoc-wireless-.html |title=Ad-hoc wireless connections limited to 11mbps |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2011|10}}.

Similarly, the Wi-Fi Alliance promotes a specification called ''[[Wi-Fi Direct]]'' for file transfers and media sharing through a new discovery- and security-methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wi-Fi Direct allows device-to-device links|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/101409-wi-fi-direct.html?hpg1=bn}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Wi-Fi Direct launched in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wi-fi.org/news_articles.php?f=media_news&amp;news_id=1011 |title=Wi-Fi gets personal: Groundbreaking Wi-Fi Direct launches today |date=2010-10-25 |accessdate=2011-01-15 |publisher=WiFi Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some devices can share their Internet connection, becoming hotspots or &quot;virtual routers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techsansar.com/internetworking/wireless-home-networking-virtual-wifi-hotspot-2946/ |title=Wireless Home Networking with Virtual WiFi Hotspot |publisher=Techsansar.com |date=2011-01-24 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of IEEE 802.11}}
802.11 technology has its origins in a 1985 ruling by the US Federal Communications Commission that released the [[ISM band]] for unlicensed use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Wi-Fi (wireless networking technology)|encyclopedia=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1473553/Wi-Fi|accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 [[NCR Corporation]] with [[AT&amp;T]] invented the precursor to 802.11 intended for use in cashier systems. The first wireless products were under the name [[WaveLAN]].

[[Vic Hayes]] has been called the &quot;father of Wi-Fi&quot;. He was involved in designing the initial standards within the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET portrait&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Charny|url=http://news.cnet.com/1200-1070-975460.html |title=CNET Vision series|publisher=[[CNET]] |date=December 6, 2002 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Business Week, April 1, 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2003/tc2003041_5423_tc107.htm |title=Paving the Airwaves for Wi-Fi |publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=April 1, 2003 |author=Olga Kharif |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 and 1996, the [[CSIRO]] obtained patents for a method later used in Wi-Fi to &quot;unsmear&quot; the signal.&lt;ref&gt;David Sygall. [http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/how-australias-top-scientist-earned-millions-from-wifi-20091207-kep4.html How Australia's top scientist earned millions from Wi-Fi]. ''The  Sydney Morning Herald'', December 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, 14 tech companies agreed to pay CSIRO for infringements on the CSIRO patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/enterprise/csiro-to-reap-lazy-billion-from-worlds-biggest-tech-companies-20100601-wsu2.html|title=CSIRO to reap 'lazy billion' from world's biggest tech companies |last=Moses |first=Asher |date=June 1, 2010 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] was formed as a trade association to hold the Wi-Fi trademark under which most products are sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Wi-Fi Alliance: Organization |work= Official industry association web site |url= http://www.wi-fi.org/organization.php |accessdate= August 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The name ''Wi-Fi''==
The term ''Wi-Fi'' suggests ''Wireless Fidelity'', resembling the long-established audio-equipment classification term ''[[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]]'' (used since 1950&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;/&gt;) or ''high fidelity'' (in use since the 1930s&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title= [[Oxford English Dictionary]]
|edition= 2
|year= 1989
|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]
|location= Oxford

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Even the Wi-Fi Alliance itself has often used the phrase ''Wireless Fidelity'' in its press releases&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
the term also appears in a white paper on Wi-Fi from [[Information Technology Association of America|ITAA]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Wi-Fi'', first used commercially in August 1999,&lt;ref&gt;US Patent and Trademark Office.{{Verify source|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was coined by a brand-consulting firm called [[Interbrand]] Corporation that the Alliance had hired to determine a name that was &quot;a little catchier than 'IEEE 802.11b Direct Sequence'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;boing&quot;&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2005/11/08/wifi_isnt_short_for_.html |publisher=boingboing.net

|title=What is the True Meaning of Wi-Fi? |accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Belanger also stated that Interbrand invented ''Wi-Fi'' as a [[pun|play on words]] with ''[[High fidelity|Hi-Fi]]'', and also created the Wi-Fi logo.

The Wi-Fi Alliance initially used an [[advertising slogan]] for Wi-Fi, &quot;The Standard for Wireless Fidelity&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;boing&quot;/&gt; but later removed the phrase from their marketing. Despite this, some documents from the Alliance dated 2003 and 2004 still contain the term ''Wireless Fidelity''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wifi_securing_2003&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wifi_deployment_2004&quot; /&gt; There was no official statement related to the dropping of the term.

The [[yin-yang]] Wi-Fi logo indicates the certification of a product for [[interoperability]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wifi_securing_2003&quot; /&gt;

Non Wi-Fi technologies intended for fixed points such as [[Motorola Canopy]] are usually described as [[fixed wireless]].  Alternative wireless technologies include mobile phone standards such as [[2G]], [[3G]] or [[4G]].

==Wi-Fi certification==
{{See also|Wi-Fi Alliance}}

The Wi-Fi Alliance enforces the use of the Wi-Fi brand to technologies based on the [[IEEE 802.11]] standards from the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]. This includes [[wireless LAN|wireless local area network]] (WLAN) connections, device to device connectivity [such as Wi-Fi Peer to Peer AKA Wi-Fi Direct], [[Personal area network]] (PAN), [[local area network]] (LAN) and even some limited [[wide area network]] (WAN) connections.

Derivative terms, such as [[Super Wi-Fi]], coined by the US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to describe proposed networking in the UHF TV band in the US, may or may not be sanctioned.

Not every Wi-Fi device is submitted for certification. The lack of Wi-Fi certification does not necessarily imply a device is incompatible with other Wi-Fi devices. If it is compliant or partly compatible, the Wi-Fi Alliance may not object to its description as a Wi-Fi device{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} though technically only certified devices are approved.

The IEEE does not test equipment for compliance with their standards. The [[non-profit]] Wi-Fi Alliance formed in 1999 to fill this void &amp;mdash; to establish and enforce standards for interoperability and [[backward compatibility]], and to promote [[wireless]] local-area-network technology. {{As of| 2010}} the Wi-Fi Alliance consisted of more than 375 companies from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Wi-Fi Alliance also developed technology that expanded the applicability of Wi-Fi, including a simple set up protocol (Wi-Fi Protected Set Up) and a peer to peer connectivity technology (Wi-Fi Peer to Peer)

&lt;/ref&gt;
Manufacturers with membership in the Wi-Fi Alliance, whose products pass the certification process, gain the right to mark those products with the Wi-Fi logo.

Specifically, the certification process requires conformance to the IEEE 802.11 radio standards, the [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA and WPA2]] security standards, and the [[Extensible Authentication Protocol|EAP]] authentication standard. Certification may optionally include tests of IEEE 802.11 draft standards, interaction with cellular-phone technology in converged devices, and features relating to security set-up, multimedia, and power-saving.&lt;ref&gt;

Most recently, a new security standard, Wi-Fi Protected Setup, allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The Internet of Things and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.&lt;ref&gt;GainSpan specifically designs for Wi-Fi technology between Wi-Fi devices. Extremely useful.

==Advantages and problems==
[[File:WiFi-detector.jpg|thumb|right|A keychain-size Wi-Fi detector]]

===Advantages===
Wi-Fi allows cheaper deployment of [[local area network]]s (LANs). Also spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs.

Manufacturers are building wireless network adapters into most laptops. The price of [[chipset]]s for Wi-Fi continues to drop, making it an economical networking option included in even more devices.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Different competitive brands of access points and client network-interfaces can inter-operate at a basic level of service. Products designated as &quot;Wi-Fi Certified&quot; by the Wi-Fi Alliance are [[backwards compatible]]. Unlike [[mobile phone]]s, any standard Wi-Fi device will work anywhere in the world.

Wi-Fi operates in more than 220,000 public hotspots and in tens of millions of homes and corporate and university campuses worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wi-Fi Finder|url=http://www.jiwire.com/search-hotspot-locations.htm|publisher=jiwire.com|accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current version of [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] encryption (WPA2) {{As of| 2010 | lc = on}} is widely considered secure, provided users employ a strong [[passphrase]].  New protocols for [[quality of service|quality-of-service]] ([[Wireless Multimedia Extensions|WMM]]) make Wi-Fi more suitable for latency-sensitive applications (such as voice and video); and power saving mechanisms (WMM Power Save) improve battery operation.

===Limitations===
Spectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: most of Europe allows for an additional two channels beyond those permitted in the US for the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band (1&amp;ndash;13 vs. 1&amp;ndash;11), while Japan has one more on top of that (1&amp;ndash;14). Europe, {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}, was essentially homogeneous in this respect.

A Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band; any two channels whose channel numbers differ by five or more, such as 2 and 7, do not overlap. The oft-repeated adage that channels 1, 6, and 11 are the ''only'' non-overlapping channels is, therefore, not accurate; channels 1, 6, and 11 do, however, comprise the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in the U.S.

[[Equivalent isotropically radiated power]] (EIRP) in the EU is limited to 20 [[dBm]] (100&amp;nbsp;mW).

The current 'fastest' norm, 802.11n, uses double the radio spectrum compared to 802.11a or 802.11g. This means there can only be one 802.11n network on 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band without interference to other WLAN traffic.

===Range===
{{See also|Long-range Wi-Fi}}
Wi-Fi networks have limited range. A typical [[wireless router]] using [[IEEE 802.11#802.11b|802.11b]] or [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]] with a stock antenna might have a range of 32&amp;nbsp;m (120&amp;nbsp;ft) indoors and 95&amp;nbsp;m (300&amp;nbsp;ft) outdoors. [[IEEE 802.11#802.11n|IEEE 802.11n]], however, can exceed that range by more than two times.&lt;ref name=wifiplanet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/tutorials/article.php/3680781 |title=802.11n Delivers Better Range|date=2007-05-31 |work=Wi-Fi Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Range also varies with frequency band. Wi-Fi in the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency block has slightly better range than Wi-Fi in the 5&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency block which is used by 802.11a. On wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas which have higher gain. Outdoor ranges can be improved to many kilometers through the use of high gain [[directional antenna]]s at the router and remote device(s). In general, the maximum amount of power that a Wi-Fi device can transmit is limited by local regulations, such as [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|FCC Part 15]] in the US.

Due to reach requirements for wireless LAN applications, Wi-Fi has fairly high power consumption compared to some other standards. Technologies such as [[Bluetooth]] (designed to support wireless [[Personal area network|PAN]] applications) provide a much shorter [[Radio propagation|propagation]] range of &lt;10m&lt;ref&gt;See for example IEEE Standard 802.15.4 section 1.2 scope
&lt;/ref&gt;
and so in general have a lower power consumption. Other low-power technologies such as [[ZigBee]] have fairly long range, but much lower data rate. The high power consumption of Wi-Fi makes battery life in mobile devices a concern.

Researchers have developed a number of &quot;no new wires&quot; technologies to provide alternatives to Wi-Fi for applications in which Wi-Fi's indoor range is not adequate and where installing new wires (such as [[Category 5 cable|CAT-5]]) is not possible or cost-effective. For example, the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard for high speed [[Local area network]]s uses existing home wiring ([[Ethernet over coax|coaxial cables]], phone lines and [[power line communication|power lines]]). Although [[G.hn]] does not provide some of the advantages of Wi-Fi (such as mobility or outdoor use), it's designed for applications (such as [[IPTV]] distribution) where indoor range is more important than mobility.

Due to the complex nature of [[radio propagation]] at typical Wi-Fi frequencies, particularly the effects of signal reflection off trees and buildings, algorithms can only approximately predict Wi-Fi signal strength for any given area in relation to a transmitter.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This effect does not apply equally to [[long-range Wi-Fi]], since longer links typically operate from towers that transmit above the surrounding foliage.

The practical range of Wi-Fi essentially confines mobile use to such applications as inventory-taking machines in warehouses or in retail spaces, [[barcode]]-reading devices at check-out stands, or receiving/shipping stations. Mobile use of Wi-Fi over wider ranges is limited, for instance, to uses such as in an automobile moving from one hotspot to another. Other wireless technologies are more suitable for communicating with moving vehicles.

===Data security risks===
The most common wireless [[encryption]]-standard, [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), has been [[Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack|shown]] to be easily breakable even when correctly configured. [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi [[Wireless access point|access points]] typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information), but such networks may use other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] ([[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]]) over [[Transport Layer Security]].

===Interference===
{{Details|Electromagnetic interference at 2.4 GHz}}

Wi-Fi connections can be disrupted or the internet speed lowered by having other devices in the same area. Many 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz 802.11b and [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]] access-points default to the same channel on initial startup, contributing to congestion on certain channels. Wi-Fi pollution, or an excessive number of access points in the area, especially on the neighboring channel, can prevent access and interfere with other devices' use of other access points, caused by overlapping channels in the 802.11g/b spectrum, as well as with decreased [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) between access points. This can become a problem in high-density areas, such as large apartment complexes or office buildings with many Wi-Fi access points.

Additionally, other devices use the 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz band: microwave ovens, [[ISM band]] devices, security cameras, [[ZigBee]] devices, Bluetooth devices and (in some countries) [[Amateur radio]], [[video sender]]s, cordless phones and [[baby monitor]]s, all of which can cause significant additional interference. It is also an issue when municipalities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/municipal-wifi.htm|title=How Municipal WiFi Works|publisher=computer.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2008-03-12|last=Wilson

&lt;/ref&gt; or other large entities (such as universities) seek to provide large area coverage.

==Hardware==
===Standard devices===

[[File:Wireless adaptor USB.jpg|thumb|[[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] wireless adapter]]

A [[wireless access point]] (WAP) connects a group of wireless devices to an adjacent wired [[Local area network|LAN]]. An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.

[[Wireless network interface controller|Wireless adapters]] allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus and [[PC Card]]. {{As of| 2010}}, most newer laptop computers come equipped with internal adapters. Internal cards are generally more difficult to install.

[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated [[Wide area network|WAN]]-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a [[cable modem]] or a [[DSL modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a desktop computer, as is the case with as Apple's [[AirPort]], which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[Mac OS X]] and [[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point connects wireless devices to a wired network at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: Data Link Layer|data-link layer]]. Two wireless bridges may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes.

Wireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters will suffer from an increased latency for each hop. Additionally, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain will have a throughput limited by the &quot;weakest link&quot; between the two nodes in the chain from which the connection originates to where the connection ends.

===Distance records===

Distance records (using non-standard devices) include 382&amp;nbsp;km (237&amp;nbsp;mi) in June 2007, held by Ermanno Pietrosemoli and EsLaRed of Venezuela, transferring about 3 MB of data between the mountain-tops of [[Pico El Ãguila|El Ãguila]] and Platillon.&lt;ref&gt;

===Embedded systems===
[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]

Increasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device which has and communicates via a serial port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market
|accessdate=2008-04-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This allows the design of simple monitoring devices. An example is a portable ECG device monitoring a patient at home. This Wi-Fi-enabled device can communicate via the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.cieonline.co.uk/cie2/articlen.asp?pid=1810&amp;id=19742|title=CIE article on embedded Wi-Fi for M2M applications
|accessdate=2008-08-27
}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These Wi-Fi modules are designed by [[OEM]]s so that implementers need only minimal Wi-Fi knowledge to provide Wi-Fi connectivity for their products.

===Multiple access points===

Increasing the number of Wi-Fi access points provides network redundancy, support for fast [[roaming]] and increased overall network-capacity by using more channels or by defining smaller [[cellular network|cells]]. Wi-Fi implementations have moved toward &quot;thin&quot; access points, with more of the [[network intelligence]] housed in a centralized network appliance, relegating individual access points to the role of &quot;dumb&quot; transceivers. Outdoor applications may use [[mesh networking|mesh]] topologies.

==Network security==

The main issue with wireless network security is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as [[ethernet]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}  With wired networking one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network) or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]].  Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/ |title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment -- Pros and Cons. |publisher=NetworkBits.net |accessdate=2008-04-08}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

An attacker who has gained access to a Wi-Fi network router can initiate a DNS spoofing attack against any other user of the network by forging a response before the queried DNS server has a chance to reply.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| url         = http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/forgery.html

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Securing methods===

A common measure to deter unauthorized users involves hiding the access point's name by disabling the [[Service set (802.11 network)|SSID]] broadcast.  While effective against the casual user, it is ineffective as a security method because the SSID is broadcast in the clear in response to a client SSID query.  Another method is to only allow computers with known [[MAC address]]es to join the network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
but determined eavesdroppers may be able join the network by [[MAC spoofing|spoofing]] an authorized address.

[[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) encryption was designed to protect against casual snooping but it is no longer considered secure.  Tools such as [[AirSnort]] or [[Aircrack-ng]] can quickly recover WEP encryption keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wireless Vulnerabilities &amp; Exploits|url=http://www.wirelessve.org/entries/show/WVE-2005-0020|publisher=wirelessve.org|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of WEP's weakness the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]] approved [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (WPA) which uses [[Temporal Key Integrity Protocol|TKIP]]. WPA was specifically designed to work with older equipment usually through a firmware upgrade.  Though more secure than WEP, WPA has known vulnerabilities.

The more secure [[WPA2]] using [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] was introduced in 2004 and is supported by most new Wi-Fi devices.  WPA2 is fully compatible with WPA.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpa2-mandatory&quot;&gt;&quot;WPA2 Security Now Mandatory for Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Products&quot; {{cite web|work=[[Wi-Fi Alliance]]| url=http://www.wi-fi.org/pressroom_overview.php?newsid=16|title=WPA2 Security Now Mandatory for Wi-Fi CERTIFIED Products}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piggybacking===
{{Main|Piggybacking (Internet access)}}

Piggybacking refers to access to a wireless Internet connection by bringing one's own computer within the range of another's wireless connection, and using that service without the subscriber's explicit permission or knowledge.

During the early popular adoption of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]], providing open access points for anyone within range to use was encouraged{{By whom|date=March 2010}} to cultivate [[wireless community network]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nocat.net/ |title=NoCat's goal is to bring you Infinite Bandwidth Everywhere for Free |publisher=Nocat.net |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly since people on average use only a fraction of their downstream bandwidth at any given time.

Recreational logging and mapping of other people's access points has become known as [[wardriving]]. Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service.  Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]].  These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2008-10-09 | title=Let's Warchalk | publisher= Matt Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Florida]] court case determined that owner laziness was not to be a valid excuse.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Piggybacking often occurs unintentionally, since most access points are configured without encryption by default and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (''see [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]''). For example, a user could inadvertently use an insecure network to log in to a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an insecure protocol such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]].

== Health issues ==

A small percentage of Wi-Fi users have reported adverse health issues after repeat exposure and use of Wi-Fi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalnews.ca/programs/16x9/video.html?releasePID=ZDqUIbEn5ki6ptoRe__s2Oz5ODXbDiZ6 |title=Official website |publisher=Globalnews.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there has been no publication of any effects being observable in [[Double-blind study|double-blind studies]]. A review of studies involving 725 people that claimed [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] found no evidence for their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/67/2/224.abstract |title=&quot;Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity: A Systematic Review of Provocation Studies &quot;, 2005 |publisher=Psychosomaticmedicine.org |date=2005-03-01 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ubiquity of Wi-Fi has led to calls for more research into the effects of &quot;electronic smog&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Lean, [http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/danger-on-the-airwaves-is-the-wifi-revolution-a-health-time-bomb-445732.html &quot;Is-the-wifi-revolution-a-health-time-bomb?&quot;], ''The Independent UK'', Sunday, 22 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

One study speculated that &quot;laptops (Wi-Fi mode) on the lap near the testes may result in decreased male fertility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;AvendaÃ±o C, Mata A, Juarez Villanueva AM, Martinez VS, Sanchez Sarmiento CA (2010) âLaptop expositions affect motility and induce DNA fragmentation in human spermatozoa in vitro by a non-thermal effect: a preliminary reportâ ''American Society for Reproductive Medicine'', 66th Annual Meeting: O-249.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found decreased working memory among males during Wi-Fi exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Papageorgiou CC, Hountala CD, Maganioti AE, Kyprianou MA, Rabavilas AD, Papadimitriou GN, Capsalis CN (2011) âEffects of wi-fi signals on the p300 component of event-related potentials during an auditory hayling taskâ ''J Integr Neurosci.'' '''10(2)''': 189-202; PMID 21714138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a BBC article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6677051.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Wi-fi health concerns |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) says &quot;there is no risk from low level, long-term exposure to wi-fi networks&quot; and the United Kingdom's [[Health Protection Agency]] reports that exposure to Wi-Fi for a year results in &quot;same amount of radiation from a 20-minute mobile phone call.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs296/en/ &quot;Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EMS)&quot;], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 research results were published by [[Wageningen University and Research Centre]], the Netherlands, which indicates that electromagnetic radiation may play a role in a deterioration in the health of trees. In a laboratory setting it appeared that portions of leaves of Ash saplings, after having been exposed for over three months to a radiation source similar to a wifi-access point, withered and died. The authors of the report noted however that further long-term tests were necessary. &lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wageningenuniversity.nl%2Fnl%2Fnieuwsagenda%2Farchief%2Fnieuws%2F2010%2FBomen101120.htm &quot;Trees suffer from electromagnetic radiation&quot;], 2010, automatic translation in English&lt;/ref&gt;
