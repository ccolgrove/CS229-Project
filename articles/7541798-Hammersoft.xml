Though the initial war lasted for only 21 days the coalition soon found themselves fighting insurgent forces more and more often.  Additionally, with the increasing use of guerilla tactics, suicide bombings and improvised explosive devices, just walking down the street became extremely dangerous.  Upon completion of the initial conflict the coalition troops began counterinsurgency, humanitarian, security and various other types of operations in order to stabilize the country and make it safe for the Iraqi people. From the end of the initial war until the present day, these are the types of operations that coalition troops continue to complete in efforts to eliminate the insurgency and anti-coalition forces.

[[File:Coaltion forces in Iraq (2004-04-30).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Areas of responsibility]] in Iraq as of 30 April 2004]]
During the early occupation, a number of widely cited humanitarian, tactical, and political errors by coalition planners, particularly the United States and United Kingdom led to a growing armed resistance, usually called the &quot;Iraqi insurgency&quot; (referred to by the mainstream media and coalition governments). The anti-occupation/anti-coalition forces are believed to be predominantly, but not exclusively, Iraqi Sunni Muslim Arabs, plus some foreign Arab and Muslim fighters, some of the latter tied to al-Qaeda. Several minor coalition members have pulled out of Iraq; this has been widely considered a political success for the anti-occupation forces.

Despite this, there was a reduction in violence throughout Iraq in the start of 2004 due to reorganization within the insurgent forces. During this time the tactics used by coalition forces were studied and the insurgency began to plan a new strategy. The calm did not last long however and once the insurgency had regained its footing attacks resumed and increased. Throughout the remainder of 2004 and continuing into the present day, the insurgency has employed Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's) and bombings as their primary means of combating the coalition forces.  This has led to hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police killed in addition to the coalition forces they were fighting.  Many were killed in a series of massive bombings at mosques and shrines throughout Iraq. The bombings indicated that as the relevance of Saddam Hussein and his followers was diminishing, radical Islamists, both foreign and Iraqi was increasing to take their place. An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming clear. The Mahdi Army also began launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq began to erupt in urban guerilla combat as coalition forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.

In response to insurgent attacks, coalition forces focused on hunting down the remaining leaders of the former regime, culminating in the shooting deaths of Saddam's two sons in July. In all, over 200 top leaders of the former regime were killed or captured, as well as supports and military personnel during the summer of 2004.

This Operation was taken over by the [[141st Engineer Combat Battalion]] (C)(W), a [[North Dakota National Guard]] unit.  Their mission was to patrol a section of Iraq's main highways and alternate routes locating and clearing roadside bombs or IED's (Improvised Explosive Device).  The secondary goal of this mission was route sanitation which included knocking down trees in the medians of the roads and clearing brush from the sides of the road where the enemy could easily hide an IED. In January 2005, the 141st Engineers were replaced by the [[467th Engineer Battalion]] (C)(W), a USAR unit from Tennessee.  The 14th Engineer Battalion returned to Iraq and relieved the 467th Engineers of the Trailblazer mission in December 2005. Alpha Company, 164th Engineers from North Dakota took over operations from the 467th Engineers in the LSA Anaconda/Balad area around the same time.

Coalition and Iraqi government forces continue to battle Iraqi [[militant]]s and other fighters. During early and mid-May 2005, the U.S. also launched [[Operation Matador (Iraq)|Operation Matador]], an assault by around 1,000 [[Marines (military)|marines]] in the ungoverned region of western Iraq.  Coalition and Iraqi soldiers, Iraqi fighters and civilians have been killed in these conflicts. As of late July 2007, nearly 3,700 U.S. soldiers have been killed, and around ten times this many have been wounded. The number of Iraqi citizens who have fallen victim to the fighting has risen. The Iraqi government, with some holdovers from the [[Coalition Provisional Authority|CPA]], engaged in securing control of the oil infrastructure (a source of Iraq's foreign currency) and control of the major cities of Iraq. The insurgency, the developing the [[New Iraqi Army]], disorganized police and security forces, as well as a lack of revenue have hampered efforts to assert control. In addition, former [[Baathist]] elements and militant [[Shia]] groups have engaged in sabotage, terrorism, open rebellion, and establishing their own security zones in all or part of a dozen cities. The [[Ayad Allawi|Allawi]] government vowed to crush the insurgency.

An [[Iraqi parliamentary election, January 2005|election]] for a government to draft a permanent constitution took place during this time (''ed''. see [[Politics of Iraq]] for more information on the political state of Iraq). Although some violence and lack of widespread [[Sunni]] participation marred the event, much of the eligible [[Kurd]] and Shia populace participated. Sectarian violence has also been prominent part of the militant and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] activity. Targets here where often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations mainly of Shias.  As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in the month.

{{See|23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings}}

The beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks. Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on February 22, 2006. The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Although no injuries occurred in the blast, the mosque was severely damaged and the bombing resulted in violence over the following days.

As of October 20 the U.S military announced that [[Operation Together Forward]] had failed to stem the tide of violence in Baghdad, and Shiite militants under al-Sadr seized several southern Iraq cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Shiite militia briefly seizes Iraqi city |publisher = MSNBC |date = 2006-10-20 |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15343811/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, the deadliest attack since the beginning of the Iraq war occurred. Suspected Sunni-Arab militants used five suicide car bombs and two mortar rounds on the capital's Shiite Sadr City slum to kill at least 215 people and wound 257. Shiite mortar teams quickly retaliated, firing 10 shells at Sunni Islam's most important shrine in Baghdad, badly damaging the Abu Hanifa mosque and killing one person. Eight more rounds slammed down near the offices of the Association of Muslim Scholars, the top Sunni Muslim organisation in Iraq, setting nearby houses on fire. Two other mortar barrages on Sunni neighborhoods in west Baghdad killed nine and wounded 21, police said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Bombs, mortars in Shiite slum kill at least 161 |publisher = MSNBC |date = 2006-11-23 |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15866123/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After capture in December 2003, [[Execution of Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein was hanged]] on December 30, 2006 after being found guilty of crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Saddam Hussein executed in Iraq |publisher = BBC |date = 2006-12-30 |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6218485.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Operation Arrowhead Ripper.jpg|thumb|right|Soldiers have a short meeting at an airfield in Baqubah before an air assault into an outlying village of the city, June 18, 2007]]

2007 saw a rise in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations as well as a large &quot;surge&quot; in US forces designed to help stabilize the region.

On January 10, 2007, President Bush announced changes in the administration's political and military strategy in the Iraq War during a television speech broadcast. The speech and underlying strategy had been crafted under the working title &quot;The New Way Forward.&quot; In the address Bush stated âAmerica will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad. This will require increasing American force levels. So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq. The vast majority of them&amp;mdash;five brigadesâwill be deployed to Baghdad.&quot;

As part of this new strategy, 2007 saw several major military operations aimed at eliminating insurgent activities, increase support services such as medical facilities and utilities and the training of Iraqi citizens as police or military personnel.

The largest of these new operations were Operations Law and Order, Phantom Thunder and Phantom Strike.
