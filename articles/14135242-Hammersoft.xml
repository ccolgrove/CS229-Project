'''WMIO''' (102.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is a [[radio station]] broadcasting a [[contemporary hit radio]] format. Licensed to [[Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico]], USA, it serves the Puerto Rico area.  The station is currently owned by Uno Radio Group and repeats the audio of WCMN-FM.

== History ==
In March 2007, Uno Radio Group officially acquired WMIO from Bestov Broadcasting (previously known as Audioactiva 102.3 FM) and chained it with [[WCMN-FM]] &quot;Toca De To' 107.3 FM&quot;.

On January 9, 2009, MSG Radio Inc. acquired [[WTOK-FM|WIAC-FM]] and through a contract with Uno Radio Group the Toca De To' brand was moved to 102.5 FM on January 16, 2009. Old Toca De To stations [[WCMN-FM]] 107.3 and WMIO 102.3 continue as &quot;107.3 Mi Emisora&quot; and  do not simulcast WIAC-FM.

In August 2011 and after 102.5 FM change its name to Hot 102, 107.3 FM and 102.3 FM adopted again the brand &quot;Toca De To&quot; but this time as a slogan.
