'''El Monte''' {{IPAc-en|É|l|_|Ë|m|É|n|t|iË}} is a  residential, industrial, and commercial city &lt;ref name=&quot;reference.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/El+Monte |title=El Monte encyclopedia topics |publisher=Reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], California, United States. The city's slogan is &quot;Welcome to Friendly El Monte,&quot;  and  historically is known as &quot;The End of the Santa Fe Trail.&quot;  As of the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 113,475, down from 115,965 at the 2000 census.  As of 2010, El Monte is the [[List of most populous cities in the United States|228th largest city in the United States]], and is the [[List of largest California cities by population|51st largest city in California]]. El Monte Lies in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] region East of the city of Los Angeles.

==Origin of name==
El Monte was literally an oasis or island in the middle of the arid San Gabriel Valley. Sitting between the San Gabriel and Rio Hondo Rivers. Residents claim that anything could be grown here due to the two rivers. Between  1770 and 1830,  Spanish soldiers and missionaries often stopped here for respite. They called the area, 'El Monte,' which in Spanish means  'meadow or marsh' or 'the wooded place.  Most people assume  the name refers to a  mountain, but the word is an archaic Spanish translation of that era, there were no mountains in the valley. The explorers had found this oasis of rich, low altitude land, blanketed with thick growths of wispy willows, alders, and cattails, located between the two rivers. They also found  wild grapevines and watercress. The &quot;Island&quot; is approximately 7 miles long and 4 miles wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;earthlink1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~jackbarton/ElMonteHistory.htm |title=A Brief History Of El Monte |publisher=Home.earthlink.net |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When  the State Legislature organized California into more manageable designated townships in the 1850s, they called it the El Monte Township. In a short time the name returned to the original El Monte.&lt;ref name=&quot;El Monte City Website Heritage page&quot;&gt;[http://www.ci.el-monte.ca.us/aboutem/pdf/Heritage.pdf El Monte City Website Heritage page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Oldesthomein-El-Monte-1922.jpg|thumb|left|Oldest home in El Monte, built 1849 (photo from 1922).]]
In earlier days, El Monte was a stopping place for the people going to the gold fields in the North, near Sacramento. The first settlers with their families were Nicholas Schmidt, Ira W. Thompson, G and F. Cuddeback, J. Corbin and J Sheldon. Settlement began in 1849, though Spanish missionaries and soldiers passed through the area as early as the 1770s. The [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]], originating in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] became a continuation of the well-known [[Santa Fe Trail]], that began in 1821, when the nationâs first major international commercial highway was estalihed stretching from [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to Santa Fe.&lt;ref name=&quot;villageprofile.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villageprofile.com/california/elmonte/02/topic.html |title=El Monte CA &amp;#124; History - Presented by Village Profile |publisher=Villageprofile.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s the village (renamed Lexington by American settlers) was the crossroad between Los Angeles, [[San Bernardino]] and [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]].  In the early days, it had a reputation as a rough town where men often settled disputes with knives and guns in its gambling saloons. Defense against Indian raids and the crimes of bandit gangs like that of [[Juan Flores]] and [[Pancho Daniel]] led to the formation of a local militia company called the [[Monte Rangers]] in February 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarymuseum.org/MonteRangers.html The California State Military Museum, California State Militia and National Guard Unit Histories: Monte Rangers]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Monte Rangers disbanded, justice for [[Los Angeles County]], in the form of a [[lynching]], was often provided by the local vigilantes called the &quot;El Monte Boys&quot;.

The first permanent residents arrived in El Monte around 1849-1850 mostly from [[Texas]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Missouri]], during a time when thousands migrated to California in search of gold. Though few found any gold, these migrants ventured upon the bounty of fruitful, rich land along the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] and began to build homesteads there. The farmers were very pleased at the increasing success of El Monteâs agricultural community, and it steadily grew over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;villageprofile.com&quot;/&gt; In 1858, it became a stop on the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]].  By 1861 El Monte had become a sizeable settlement and during the [[American Civil War]] was considered a stronghold of sympathetic secessionists.  [[A. J. King]] an Undersheriff of Los Angeles County (and former member of the earlier &quot;Monte Rangers&quot; or &quot;Monte Boys&quot;) with other influential men in El Monte, formed a secessionist militia company, like the [[Los Angeles Mounted Rifles]], called the Monte Mounted Rifles on March 23, 1861. However the attempt failed when following the [[battle of Fort Sumter]], A. J. King marched through the streets with a portrait of the Confederate General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] [[File:OldSpanishTrail.png|200px|right|thumb|The route of the Old Spanish Trail]] and was arrested by a [[U.S. Marshal]].  State arms sent from Governor [[John G. Downey]] for the unit were held up by Union officers at the port of [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]].  Union troops established [[New Camp Carleton]] near the town in March 1862 to suppress any rebellion, it was shut down three years later at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarymuseum.org/CpCarlton.html The California State Military Museum, Historic California Posts: Camp Carleton (Camp Banning, Camp Prentiss, New Camp Carleton)]&lt;/ref&gt; El Monte was the first town in [[Southern California]] to be founded by American citizens of European descent.   
[[Southern Pacific]] built a railroad depot in town in 1873, stimulating the growth of local agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Related Articles |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1076729/Gays-Lion-Farm |title=Gay's Lion Farm (farm, El Monte, California, United States) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.co.jp/azbrowse/g/g24.html |title=ããªã¿ãã«ã»ã¸ã£ãã³ - EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica A-Z Browse |publisher=Britannica.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  El Monte was incorporated as a municipality in 1912.  During the 1930s, the city became a vital site for the [[New Deal]]'s federal Subsistence Homestead project, a [[Resettlement Administration]] program that  helped grant single-family ranch houses to qualifying applicants.  Famous photographer [[Dorothea Lange]] took many pictures of the houses for her work for the [[Farm Security Administration]].  

Formerly home to many white settlers from the 1930s [[Dust Bowl]] Migration, the city has evolved into a majority  [[Hispanic]] community.   Representing the historical significance of the [[Santa Fe Trail]], El Monte built the Santa Fe Trail Historical Park in 1989, at Valley Blvd and Santa Anita Ave.&lt;ref name=&quot;villageprofile.com&quot;/&gt; The trail remained Americaâs greatest route for several decades thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=21427 |title=Los Angeles |publisher=Ohp.parks.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The El Monte Historical Museum &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findlocal.latimes.com/el-monte/art/museum/el-monte-museum-of-history-el-monte-museum |title=El Monte Historical Society Museum - El Monte, CA 91731 &amp;#124; Find Local Los Angeles |publisher=Findlocal.latimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; at 3150 Tyler Avenue, is considered to be one of the best community museums in the state of California.&lt;ref name=&quot;earthlink1&quot;/&gt;

==Entertainment history==
El Monte is credited with being the birth place of TV variety shows. ''Hometown Jamboree'', a KTLA-TV Los Angeles-based show, was actually produced at the American Legion Stadium in El Monte, California in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/cliffie-stone |title=Full List of Inductees |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Saturday night stage show was hosted and produced by [[Cliffie Stone]], who helped popularize country music in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson |first=Valerie J. |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-molly-bee11-2009feb11,0,7175717.story |title=Molly Bee dies at 69; country singer |publisher=latimes.com |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, as the unstable racial climate and the hostility toward rock &amp; roll started to merge, rock &amp; roll shows were forced from the City of Los Angeles by police pressure. The El Monte Legion Stadium, outside the city limits, became the site of a series for rock and roll concerts by [[Johnny Otis]] and other performers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000814/Johnny-Otis.html |title=Johnny Otis Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date=1921-12-28 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Johnny Otis along with [[Alan Freed]] and [[Dick Clark]] were the major powers in the growing rock and roll industry.)  During the fifties, teenagers from all over Southern California flocked to El Monte Legion Stadium every Friday and Saturday night to see their favorite performers.  Famous singers who performed there include: the  [[Ritchie Valens]], [[Rosie &amp; The Originals]], [[Brenton Wood]],  [[Earth Wind &amp; Fire]], [[The Grateful Dead]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/details/gd1970-12-26.sbd.ashley-field.34031.sbeok.flac16 |title=Grateful Dead Live at Legion Stadium on 1970-12-26 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dick Dale]] and his Del-Tones and  Johnny &quot;Guitar&quot; Watson. Disc jockeys [[Art Laboe]] and [[Huggy Boy]] enhanced the stadium's popularity  with their highly publicized Friday Night Dances with many popular record artists of the late 1950s and 1960s.  &quot;El Monte Legion Stadium&quot;, as it was often called, was the  &quot;Happening&quot; place to be for the teenagers of that era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200805/1211504190.html |title=History-Making Oldies Cruise Announced - Doo Wop Cruise, Doo-Wop, Oldies Cruises |publisher=Free-press-release.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a closed-circuit telecast,  [[The Beatles]] and the [[Beach Boys]] were seen there on March 14, 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topix.net/album/detail/el-monte-ca/A8S40HCDILPQ4HIQ |title=The Beatles in El Monte, CA - El Monte Photo Album |publisher=Topix |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Monte is  known for the long-time rock &amp; roll hit &quot;[[Memories of El Monte]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foreveroldies.com/various/memoriesofel.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Frank Zappa]] and originally recorded by [[The Penguins]], one of the local [[Doo-wop]] groups from the 1950s that became famous nationwide. The song is in remembrance of The El Monte Legion Stadium and can be heard on many albums including ''Art Laboe's Memories of El Monte''. Although the stadium closed their doors nearly 50 years ago, the music continues to live on.&lt;ref&gt;Even though the stadium closed their doors almost fifty years ago, the music and the memories, continues to live on.&lt;/ref&gt;
El Monte was the birthplace of singerâguitarist [[Mary Ford]], of [[Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford]] fame.  John Larkin, known as ([[Scatman John]]), is also a native.   El Monte was home to musicians Gregg Myers and [[Country Joe McDonald|Joe McDonald]], who performed in the 1960s with [[Country Joe &amp; the Fish]].   [[Cheech Marin]] of [[Cheech and Chong]] fame was an El Monte denizen.

A popular attraction from 1925 to 1942 was [[Gay's Lion Farm]].  Two European retired circus stars, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Gay, operated this tourist attraction, which has been called âthe Disneyland of the 1920s and 1930sâ by historian Jack Barton,&lt;ref name=&quot;earthlink1&quot;/&gt; and many others of that era.. The Gays raised wild animals for use in the motion picture industry and housed over 200 African lions.   Many of the lions starred in films during the 1920s and 1930s, including the [[Tarzan]] films starring [[Elmo Lincoln]] and [[Johnny Weismuller]]. The [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] lion logo was made with &quot;Slats&quot; (1924â1927), and his lookalike successor &quot;Jackie&quot;.  In 1925, El Monte Union High School adopted âThe Lionsâ name for its teams, and the Gays provided a lion mascot for big games.  The famous live lion farm was closed temporarily due to wartime meat shortages. It never reopened, but a life-sized memorial statue can be seen next to I-10 on the SE corner of [[Valley Boulevard]] and Peck Road. The original lion statue, commissioned for the Farm, stands in front of nearby [[El Monte High School]].

Horse racing's most famous jockey, [[Willie Shoemaker]], was a resident and attended El Monte High School, until he dropped out to work in the nearby stables.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/biography/willie-shoemaker&lt;/ref&gt;
El Monte was also briefly the home to author [[James Ellroy]] until his mother Geneva was murdered there in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ocregister.com/entertainment/ellroy-143160-says-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Former baseball player [[Fred Lynn]] was a resident of El Monte.  Actor-filmmaker [[Timothy Carey]] filmed much of his underground feature ''The World's Greatest Sinner'' (1962) in El Monte. Modern  authors Salvador Plascencia, 33, and Michael  Jaime-Becerra, 36, both grew up in El Monte and each references El Monte in his novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Reed |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/la-ca-el-monte-20100425,0,4721719.story |title=Writers Salvador Plascencia and Michael Jaime-Becerra share a city and common inspiration: El Monte |publisher=chicagotribune.com |date=2010-04-25 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Ed, the Palomino of the classic 60s television show, was foaled in 1949 in El Monte and named &quot;Bamboo Harvester&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/film/horsefame/MrEd2.html |title=mr ed story |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist collective &quot;mindfunk&quot; work live art studio is based in El Monte.
