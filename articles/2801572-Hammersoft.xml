'''Fimbul Ice Shelf''' is an [[ice shelf]] about 120 miles long and 60 miles wide, nourished by [[Jutulstraumen Glacier]], bordering the coast of [[Queen Maud Land]] from 3Â° W to 3Â° E. It was photographed from the air by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938â39), mapped by Norwegian cartographers from surveys and air photos by the [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE) (1949â1952) and air photos by the Norwegian expedition (1958â59) and named Fimbulisen (the giant ice).
