The episode of '''Saint George and the Dragon''' appended to the [[hagiography]] of [[Saint George]] was Eastern in origin,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, ''The Medieval Saints' Lives'' (pp 51-52) suggested that the [[dragon]] motif was transferred to the George legend from that of his father fellow [[soldier saint]], [[Saint Theodore Tiro]]. The Roman Catholic writer [[Alban Butler]] (''Lives of the Saints'') was at pains to credit the motif as a late addition: &quot;It should be noted, however, that the story of the dragon, though given so much prominence, was a later accretion, of which we have no sure traces before the twelfth century. This puts out of court the attempts made by many folklorists to present St. George as no more than a [[Christianization|christianized survival]] of pagan mythology.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; brought back with the [[Crusaders]] and retold with the courtly [[appurtenance]]s belonging to the [[Romance (genre)|genre of Romance]]. The earliest known depictions of the motif are from tenth- or eleventh-century [[Cappadocia]]&lt;ref&gt;Walter 2003:128, noted by [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=62490&amp;partid=1&amp;catalogueOnly=true&amp;catParentPageid=25390&amp;output=bibliography%2F!!%2FOR%2F!!%2F6256%2F!%2F%2F!%2FA%20Catalogue%20of%20the%20Russian%20Icons%20in%20the%20British%20Museum%2F!%2F%2F!!%2F%2F!!!%2F&amp;catalogueName=Icons%20in%20the%20British%20Museum&amp;catalogueSection=A%20catalogue%20of%20the%20Russian%20icons%20in%20the%20British%20Museum&amp;sortBy=catNumber British Museum Russian Icon &quot;The Miracle of St George and the Dragon / Black George&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; and eleventh-century [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]];&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' 2003:141, notes the earliest datable image, at Pavnisi, Georgia (1154-58)&lt;/ref&gt; previously, in the [[iconography]] of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], George had been depicted as a [[soldier]] since at least the seventh century. The earliest known surviving narrative of the dragon episode is an eleventh-century Georgian text.&lt;ref&gt;Patriarchal Library, Jerusalem, codex 2, according to Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' 2003:140; Walter quotes the text at length, from a Russian translation.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Shakespeare]] refers to St. George and the Dragon in [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]; act v, also in [[King Lear]]; act I.
&lt;center&gt;{{cquote| ''Advance our standards, set upon our foes Our ancient world of courage fair&lt;br /&gt;St. George Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons''..... &lt;small&gt;Richard III. act v, sc.3.&lt;/small&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;{{cquote|''Come not between the Dragon and his wrath''.....&lt;small&gt; King Lear. Act I, Sc 2&lt;/small&gt;}}&lt;/center&gt;

The [[dragon]] motif was first combined with the already standardised ''Passio Georgii'' in [[Vincent of Beauvais]]' encyclopedic ''[[Vincent_of_Beauvais#Speculum_Historiale|Speculum Historiale]]'', and then  [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (ca 1260) guaranteed its popularity in the later Middle Ages as a literary and pictorial subject.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''Faith and Fire'' Continuum Publishing, 1993 ISBN 1-85285-073-6 page 272&lt;/ref&gt; The legend gradually became part of the [[Saint George: Devotions, traditions and prayers|Christian traditions relating to Saint George]] and was used in many festivals thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Roy, 2005, ''Traditional Festivals'' ISBN 978-1-57607-089-5 page 408; Dorothy Spicer, ''Festivals of Western Europe'', (BiblioBazaar), 2008 ISBN 1-4375-2015-4, page 67&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' the narrative episode of Saint George and the Dragon took place in a place he called &quot;Silene,&quot; in [[Libya]]; the ''Golden Legend'' is the first to place this legend in Libya as a sufficiently exotic locale, where a dragon might be imagined. In the tenth-century Georgian narrative, the place is the fictional city of Lasia, and it is the godless Emperor who is ''Selinus''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Walter 2003:141.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The town had a pond, as large as a [[lake]], where a [[Bubonic plague|plague]]-bearing [[European dragon|dragon]] dwelled that [[venom|envenomed]] all the countryside. To appease the dragon, the people of Silene used to feed it two [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] every day, and when the sheep failed, they fed it their children, chosen by [[lottery]]. It happened that the lot fell on the king's daughter, who is in some versions of the story called Sabra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=langm&amp;book=saints&amp;story=patron&lt;/ref&gt; The king, distraught with grief, told the people they could have all his [[gold]] and [[silver]] and half of his kingdom if his daughter were spared; the people refused. The daughter was sent out to the lake, decked out as a [[bride]], to be fed to the dragon.

[[Saint George]] by chance rode past the lake.  The princess, trembling, sought to send him away, but George vowed to remain. The dragon reared out of the lake while they were conversing. Saint George fortified himself with the [[Sign of the Cross]],&lt;ref&gt;In the earliest, Georgian version where the dragon is more clearly a representation of [[pagan]]ism, or at least of [[Hell|infernal]] power, the sign of the Cross itself was sufficient to defeat the dragon.&lt;/ref&gt; charged it on horseback with his lance and gave it a grievous wound. Then he called to the princess to throw him her girdle, and he put it around the dragon's neck. When she did so, the dragon followed the girl like a meek beast on a leash.

She and Saint George led the dragon back to the city of Silene, where it terrified the people at its approach. But Saint George called out to them, saying that if they consented to become Christians and be baptised, he would slay the dragon before them. The king and the people of Silene [[christianization|converted to Christianity]], George slew the dragon, and the body was carted out of the city on four ox-carts. &quot;Fifteen thousand men baptized, without women and children.&quot;  On the site where the dragon died, the king built a church to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] and Saint George, and from its altar a spring arose whose waters [[panacea (medicine)|cured all disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Thus Jacobus de Voragine, in William Caxton's translation ([http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/goldenlegend/GL-vol3-george.html On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Traditionally, the sword&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.ix.netcom.com/~kiyoweap/myth/arms-weap/ascalon.htm Ascalon, Askalon (Seven Champions); Askelon (Percy's ballads) ]&lt;/ref&gt; with which St. George slew the dragon was called ''Ascalon'', a name recalling the city of [[Ashkelon]], [[Israel]]. From this tradition, the name ''Ascalon'' was used by [[Winston Churchill]] for his personal aircraft during [[World War II]] (records at [[Bletchley Park]]), since St. George is the Patron Saint of England.

==Origins==
[[Image:Rogier van der Weyden - Saint George and the Dragon.jpg|left|thumb|''Saint George and the Dragon'', by [[Rogier van der Weyden]]]]
The [[Dragonslayers|figure of the dragon slayer]] figures in the founding myth of [[Delphi]], where [[Apollo]] slays the ''drakon'' [[Pytho]]{{fact|date=October 2011}}, and has ancient Near Eastern roots as old{{fact|date=October 2011}} as Mesopotamian [[Labbu]]. A dragon is also an enemy figure in the [[Book of Revelation]] (chapter 12 onwards) and in the saintly legend of [[Margaret the Virgin]]. 

The region had long venerated other religious figures. These historians deem it likely that certain elements of their ancient worship could have passed to their Christian successors. Notable among these ancient [[deities]] was [[Sabazios]], the [[Sky]] [[Father]] of the [[Phrygia]]ns and known as [[Sabazius]] to the Romans. This god was traditionally depicted riding on horseback. 

The iconic image of St. George on horseback trampling the serpent-[[European dragon|dragon]] beneath him is considered to be similar to these pre-Christian representations of [[Sabazios]], the mounted god of [[Phrygia]] and [[Thrace]].

According to [[Christopher Booker]] it is more likely, however, that the &quot;George and the Dragon&quot; story is a medieval adaptation of the ancient Greek myth of [[Perseus]] and [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]âevidence for which can be seen in the similarity of events and locale in both stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Booker | first = Christopher | authorlink = Christopher Booker | year = 2004 |title = The Seven Basic Plots | pages = 25â26 | publisher = Continuum | isbn = 978-0-8264-5209-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this connection, the Perseus and Andromeda myth was known throughout the Middle Ages from the influence of [[Ovid]]. In imagery, other Greek myths also played a role. &quot;Medieval artists used the Greco-Roman image of [[Bellerophon]] and the [[Chimaera]] as the template for representations of Saint George and the Dragon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/greek-mythology/dragons.html ''Theoi Greek Mythology''].&lt;/ref&gt; 

These myths in turn may derive from an earlier [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] myth concerning the battle between the Storm God [[Teshub|Tarhun]] and the dragon [[Illuyankas]]. Such stories also have counterparts in other [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European mythologies]]: the slaying of the serpent [[Vritra]] by [[Indra]] in [[Vedic mythology|Vedic religion]], the battle between [[Thor]] and [[JÃ¶rmungandr]] in the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] story of [[Ragnarok]], the [[Greek Mythology|Greek]] account of the defeat of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Typhon]] by [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mallory | first = J. P. | authorlink = JP Mallory| year = 1989 |title = In Search of the Indo-Europeans | publisher = Thames and Hudson | isbn = 0-500-27616-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Parallels also exist outside of Indo-European mythology, for example the [[Babylonian]] myths of [[Marduk]] slaying the dragon [[Tiamat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/blc/blc11.htm Combat of Marduk and Tiamat in the Babylonian Creation Myths, Fourth Tablet at Sacred-texts.com] The killing of Tiamat is featured from line 93&lt;/ref&gt; The book of [[Book of Job|Job]] 41:21 speaks of a creature whose &quot;breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/108/18/41.html Job 41;21]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italy]], [[Saint Mercurialis]], first bishop of the city of [[ForlÃ¬]], is also depicted slaying a dragon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06137a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Forli&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Saint Julian of Le Mans]], [[Saint Veran]], [[Saint BienheurÃ©]], [[Saint Crescentinus]], Saint [[Margaret of Antioch]], Saint [[Clement of Metz]], Saint [[Martha]], [[Saint Quirinus of Malmedy]], [[Saint Donatus of Arezzo]], and [[Saint Leonard of Noblac]] were also venerated as dragon-slayers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythofrancaise.asso.fr/mythes/themes/saurocto.htm Sauroctones&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Others trace the origin of Saint George and the Dragon to Palestine,where the supposed dragon was controlled by Satan.  The creature blocked the city's water supply and would only move if given a virgin sacrifice.  Over time, all of the virgins were sacrificed except for the noble's daughter, and even she was sent to quench the castle's thirst.  However, Saint George (or Mar Jiryis ) arrived at the last moment on his white horse, striking down the dragon with a spear between its eyes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/stgeorge.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary retelling==
 
*The 1898 ''Dream Days'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]] includes a chapter entitled [[The Reluctant Dragon]], in which an elderly St. George and a benign dragon stage a mock battle to satisfy the townsfolk and get the dragon introduced into society.  Later made into a film by [[Walt Disney Productions]], and set to music by [[John Rutter]] as a children's [[operetta]].
* In 1935 [[Stanley Holloway]] recorded a humorous retelling of the tale as ''St. George and the Dragon'' written by Weston and Lee
*''The [[Dragon Knight]]'', a series of books by [[Gordon R. Dickson]], adopted this story as a past event into its canon, significant in that dragons had since referred to humans as 'georges.' The story of St. George and the Dragon is referred to on occasion, but never told.  The first book in the series, ''The Dragon and the George'', is a retelling of a previous [[short story]] by the same author, &quot;St. Dragon and the George&quot;.
*In the 1950s, [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Daws Butler]] wrote and performed ''[[St. George and the Dragonet|St. George and the Dragon-Net]]'' (a [[satire|spoof]] of the tale and of ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]'') for Freberg's radio show. The story's recording became the first comedy album to sell over 1 million copies.
*A 1975 episode of &quot;[[Space: 1999]]&quot; titled &quot;Dragon's Domain&quot; made reference to the legend of St. George and the Dragon. A crewman from the space station heroically kills a dragon-like creature after it has consumed other astronauts. The main character played by [[Barbara Bain]] eventually concludes that the crewman's story will create new mythology similar to the legend of St. George.
*The 1981 [[Paramount Pictures]]/[[Disney]] film ''[[Dragonslayer]]'' was loosely based on the tale.&lt;ref name=&quot;concept&quot;&gt;''No Land is an Urland- The Creation of the World of Dragonslayer'' by Danny Fingeroth from ''Dragonslayer- The Official Marvel Comics Adaptation of the Spectacular Paramount/Disney Motion Picture!'', Marvel Super Special Vol.1, No. 20, published by Marvel Comics Group, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[EC Comics]] published a comic called &quot;By George!!&quot; in ''[[Weird Fantasy]]'' #15. The story revealed that the 'dragon' was in fact a lost, misunderstood alien child who didn't mean any harm.
*[[Margaret Hodges]] retold the legend in a 1984 children's book (''[[Saint George and the Dragon (book)|Saint George and the Dragon]]'') with [[Caldecott Medal]]-winning illustrations by [[Trina Schart Hyman]].
*American artist [http://www.crggallery.com/artists/butt-johnson/ Butt Johnson] uses the theme in a drawing entitled [http://www.buttjohnson.com/drawings/mario/mario.html &quot;Mario, Patron Saint of Brooklyn&quot;] portraying characters from the video game [[Super Mario Bros.]], and featuring [[Mario]] in the role of Saint George â slaying the &quot;dragon&quot; [[Bowser (character)|(King Koopa)]].
*The poem &quot;Fairy Tale&quot; by Yury Zhivagoâthe main character from [[Boris Pasternak]]'s novel &quot;[[Doctor Zhivago]]&quot;ârelates a modified account of this legend; Yury's poem differs in that it is nonreligious and makes no mention of the village.
*In [[Elizabeth Kostova]]'s ''[[The Historian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[The Historian]]&lt;/ref&gt; Saint George is chronicled as being the saint who killed [[Vlad Tepesh]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Vlad tepes]]&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as [[Dracula]], which means &quot;son of the dragon&quot; or &quot;son of the devil&quot;).
*In [[Graham McNeill| Graham McNeill's]] book ''[[Mechanicum]]'', part of the [[Horus Heresy]] series, the story is retold and St. George is revealed to be the future [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Emperor of mankind]].
*In Ben 10 Ultimate Alien: A Knight to Remember, Sir George appear in the series.

==Alternative legends==

The village of [[Wormingford]] in [[Essex]], England also lays claim to the George and the Dragon legend.  A dragon, now believed to have been a crocodile that escaped from [[Richard I]], was slain in the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]].  There are differing accounts, including different dragon slayers, however one popular account tells how Sir George Marney (of Layer de la Haye) killed the dragon with his [[lance]].  The [[church (building)|church]] in [[Wormingford]] (which is dedicated to [[St Andrew]]) has a stained glass window depicting this scene.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bures-online.co.uk/dragon/worm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dedhamvalesociety.org.uk/Files/VillageWORMINGFORD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One version of the tale tells St. George as losing the battle with the dragon early on in the encounter.  St. George retreats, and wanders down to the river.  He prays over his challenges, and removes his armor to melt it down.  He takes the melted metal and forges it into a metal box.  He places his fears, doubts, and lack of faith inside the box, and goes out to face the dragon again, without armor.  St. George instantly slays the dragon.  Some scholars interpret the moral of this story is that our fears and doubts are all that prevent us from overcoming seemingly impossible obstacles.
