'''Botswana''', officially the '''Republic of Botswana''' ({{lang-tn|Lefatshe la Botswana}}), is a [[landlocked country]] located in [[Southern Africa]]. The citizens are referred to as &quot;Batswana&quot; (singular: Motswana). Formerly the British [[protectorate]] of [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]], Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] on 30 September 1966. It has held free and fair democratic [[Elections in Botswana|elections]] since independence.

Botswana is flat, and up to 70% is covered by the [[Kalahari Desert]]. It is bordered by [[South Africa]] to the south and southeast, [[Namibia]] to the west and north, and [[Zimbabwe]] to the northeast. Its border with [[Zambia]] to the north is poorly defined but at most is a few hundred meters long. &lt;ref&gt;[http://babakfakhamzadeh.com/site/index.php?c=12&amp;i=1279 Zambia-Botswana border]&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-sized country of just over two million people, Botswana is one of the [[List of countries by population density|most sparsely populated]] countries in the world. Botswana was one of the poorest countries in Africa when it gained independence from Britain in 1966, with a GDP per capita of about US$70. Botswana has since transformed itself, becoming one of the fastest-growing economies in the world to a GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita of about $14,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bc.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |accessdate=25 November 2011 |publisher=CIA }}&lt;/ref&gt; The country also has a strong tradition as a [[representative democracy]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Botswana}}
{{History of Botswana}}

[[Image:Gaboronecitycentre.JPG|thumb|left|City centre buildings in [[Gaborone]], Botswana]]
[[Image:BotswanaDwelling.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;A traditional dwelling&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the 19th century, hostilities broke out between [[Tswana people|Tswana]] inhabitants of Botswana and [[Ndebele people|Ndebele]] tribes who were making incursions into the territory from the north-east. Tensions also escalated with the [[Boer]] settlers from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to the east. After appeals by the Batswana leaders [[Khama III]], Bathoen and Sebele for assistance, the British Government put &quot;Bechuanaland&quot; under its protection on 31 March 1885. The northern territory remained under direct administration as the Bechuanaland Protectorate and is modern-day Botswana, while the southern territory became part of the [[Cape Colony]] and is now part of the northwest province of South Africa. The majority of [[Setswana]]-speaking people today live in South Africa.

When the [[Union of South Africa]] was formed in 1910 out of the main British colonies in the region, the Bechuanaland Protectorate, [[Basutoland]] (now [[Lesotho]]) and [[Swaziland]] (the &quot;High Commission Territories&quot;) were not included, but provision was made for their later incorporation. However, a vague undertaking was given to consult their inhabitants, and although successive South African governments sought to have the territories transferred, Britain kept delaying; consequently, it never occurred. The election of the [[National Party (South Africa)|Nationalist]] government in 1948, which instituted [[apartheid]], and South Africa's withdrawal from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa.

An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans. Proclamations in 1934 regularized tribal rule and powers. A European-African advisory council was formed in 1951, and the 1961 constitution established a consultative legislative council.

In June 1964, Britain accepted proposals for a democratic self-government in Botswana. The seat of government was moved in 1965 from [[Mafeking|Mafikeng]] in South Africa, to the newly established [[Gaborone]], which sits near its border. The 1965 constitution led to the first general elections and to independence on 30 September 1966. [[Seretse Khama]], a leader in the independence movement and the legitimate claimant to the [[Bamangwato|Ngwato]] chiefship, was elected as the first president, re-elected twice.

The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, [[Quett Masire]], who was elected in his own right in 1984 and re-elected in 1989 and 1994. Masire retired from office in 1998. The presidency passed to the sitting vice president, [[Festus Mogae]], who was elected in his own right in 1999 and re-elected in 2004. The presidency passed in 2008 to [[Ian Khama]] (son of the first president), who resigned his position as leader of the [[Botswana Defence Force]] to take up this civilian role.

A long-running dispute over the northern border with [[Namibia]]'s [[Caprivi Strip]] was the subject of a ruling by the [[International Court of Justice]] in December 1999, which ruled that [[Kasikili Island]] belongs to Botswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southern-eagle.com/namibia/namgeninfo.html |title=Namibia General Information |publisher=Southern-eagle.com |date=1990-03-21 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and government==
{{Main|Politics of Botswana|Human rights in Botswana}}
{{See also|Foreign relations of Botswana}}
The politics of Botswana take place in a framework of a [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Botswana]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of Botswana]]. [[Botswana general election, 2009|The most recent election]], its tenth, was held on 16 October 2009.

Since independence was declared, the party system has been dominated by the [[Botswana Democratic Party]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. According to [[Transparency International]], Botswana is the least corrupt country in Africa and ranks similarly close to Portugal and South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Transparency International [http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table 2008 Corruption Perception Index 2008]. Retrieved 7-23-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless the country is considered having the most secretive public institutions. &lt;ref&gt;Botswana, Southern Africa's most secretive state [http://mg.co.za/article/2011-11-11-botswana-southern-africas-most-secretive-state].

&lt;!-- Blank space above for formatting purposes --&gt;
At {{convert|600370|kmÂ²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} Botswana is the world's 47th-largest country (after [[Ukraine]]). It is comparable in size to [[Madagascar]], and is slightly smaller than the U.S. state of [[Texas]] or the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]]. It lies between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17Â°]] and [[27th parallel south|27Â°S]], and longitudes [[20th meridian east|20Â°]] and [[30th meridian east|30Â°E]].

The country is predominantly flat, tending toward gently rolling [[plateau|tableland]]. Botswana is dominated by the [[Kalahari Desert]], which covers up to 70% of its land surface. The [[Okavango Delta]], the world's largest inland [[River delta|delta]], is in the northwest. The [[Makgadikgadi Pan]], a large [[salt pan (geology)|salt pan]], lies in the north.

The [[Limpopo River]] Basin, the major landform of all of [[southern Africa]], lies partly in Botswana, in the southeast of the country. The [[Cuando River|Chobe River]] lies to the north, providing a boundary between Botswana and [[Namibia]] (Caprivi Region). The Chobe River meets with the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] at a place called [[Kazungula]] (meaning a small sausage tree, a point where [[Sebitwane]] and his [[Makololo|Makololo tribe]] crossed the Zambezi into Zambia).

Botswana has diverse areas of wildlife habitat. In addition to the delta and desert areas, there are [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, where [[Blue Wildebeest]], [[antelope]]s, and other mammals and birds are found. Northern Botswana has one of the few remaining large populations of the endangered [[African Wild Dog]]. [[Chobe National Park]], found in the [[Chobe District]], has the world's largest concentration of [[African elephant]]s. The park covers about {{convert|11000|kmÂ²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and supports about 350 species of birds.

The Chobe National Park and [[Moremi Game Reserve]] (in the Okavango Delta) are major tourist destinations. Other reserves include the [[Central Kalahari Game Reserve]] located in the Kalahari desert in [[Ghanzi District]]; [[Makgadikgadi Pans National Park]] and [[Nxai Pan National Park]] are in [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]] in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Mashatu Game Reserve is privately owned: located where the [[Shashe River]] and Limpopo River meet in eastern Botswana. The other privately owned reserve is [[Mokolodi Nature Reserve]] near Gaborone. There are also specialised sanctuaries like the [http://www.khamarhinosanctuary.com/ Khama Rhino Sanctuary] (for Rhinoceros) and Makgadikgadi Sanctuary (for Flamingos). They are both located in Central District.

===Environmental problems===
[[Image:Moremi gorge 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Moremi Gorge, in the Tswapong Hills east of [[Palapye]], Botswana. The porous rock absorbs rainwater, which then seeps out forming permanent cascades and pools. The hills provide one of Botswana's two breeding sites for the endangered [[cape vulture]].]]

Botswana is currently facing two major [[Natural environment|environment]]al problems: [[drought]] and [[desertification]].  The desertification problems predominantly stem from the severe times of drought in the country.  Due to the drought, 75% of the countryâs human and animal populations are dependent on groundwater.  [[Groundwater]] use has eased the effects of drought, but has left a toll on the land. Groundwater is retrieved through drilling deep boreholes, which leads to the erosion of the land.  Surface water is very scarce in Botswana and less than 5% of the agriculture in the country is sustainable by [[rainfall]].  Due to this 95% of the country raises [[cattle]] and [[livestock]] as a means for an income.  Therefore, it is not a surprise to see that 71% of the countryâs land is used for communal [[grazing]], which has been a major cause for the desertification of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;rala.is&quot;&gt;{{citation | publisher = Rala | place = IS | url = http://www.rala.is/rade/ralareport/darkoh.pdf | title = Darkoh | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since raising livestock has proven to be profitable for the people of Botswana, the land is continuing to be exploited. The animal populations have continued to dramatically increase. From 1966 to 1991 the livestock population has increased from 1.7 million to 5.5 million&lt;ref name = &quot;rala.is&quot; /&gt;{{rp |64}}.  Similarly, the human population has increased from 574,000 in 1971 to 1.5 million in 1995, nearly a 200% increase.  âOver 50% of all households in Botswana own cattle, which is presently the largest single source of rural incomeâ.  âRangeland degradation or desertification is regarded as the reduction in land productivity as a result of overstocking and overgrazing or as a result of veld product gathering for commercial use.  Degradation is exacerbated by the effects of drought and climate changeâ.&lt;ref name = &quot;rala.is&quot; /&gt;  It has been reported that the [[Okavango Delta]] is drying up due to the increased grazing of livestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.afrol.com/articles/21794 |title= Botswana, US sign 'Debt-for-Nature' agreement |publisher=Afrol | date = | accessdate = 2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Okavango Delta is one of the major semi-forested wetlands in Botswana, the largest inland delta in the world and is a crucial ecosystem to the survival of many animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol.com&quot;/&gt;

The Department and Forestry and Range Resources has already begun to implement project to reintroduce indigenous [[vegetation]] into communities in Kgalagadi South, Kweneng North and Boteti.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = UNCCD | url = http://www.unccd.int/iydd/documents/NOTCDIB.pdf | title = NOTCDIB | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reintroduction of indigenous vegetation will help with the degradation of the land. The [[United States Government]] has also entered into an agreement with Botswana, giving them $7 million US dollars to reduce Botswanaâs debt by $8.3 million US dollars.  The stipulation of the US reducing Botswanaâs debt is that Botswana will focus on more extensive [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of the land.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] claims that a major problem behind the overexploitation of resources, including land, in Botswana, is due to the [[poverty]] level.  To help change this the UNDP joined in with a project started in the southern community of Struizendam in Botswana.  The purpose of the project is to draw from âindigenous knowledge and traditional land management systemsâ.  The leaders of this movement are supposed to be the people in the community, in order to draw these in, in turn increasing their possibilities to earn an income and thus decreasing poverty.  The UNDP also stated that the government has to effectively implement policies to allow people to manage their own local resources and are giving the government information to help with policy development&lt;ref name = &quot;afrol1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.afrol.com/articles/13090 | title = Botswana villages fighting desertification |publisher=Afrol |date= |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defence==
{{Main|Botswana Defence Force}}
At the time of independence, Botswana had no armed forces. It was only after the [[Rhodesia]]n and [[South African Army|South African]] militaries struck respectively against [[ZIPRA]] and [[Umkhonto we Sizwe|MK]]&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-20/news/mn-6620_1_african-national-congress&lt;/ref&gt; bases that the [[Botswana Defence Force]] (BDF) was formed in 1977.{{cn|date=November 2011}} The president is commander in chief and appoints a defence council. The BDF has approximately 12,000 members.

Following political changes in South Africa and the region, the BDF's missions have increasingly focused on prevention of [[poaching]], [[Emergency management|preparing for disasters]], and foreign [[peacekeeping]]. The United States has been the largest single foreign contributor to the development of the BDF, and a large segment of its officer corps has received U.S. training. It is considered an apolitical and professional institution{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

The Botswana government gave the United States the green light to explore the possibility of establishing an Africa Command (Africom) base in the country. This fueled protests by the South African ANC youth organisation.

Since independence, Botswana has had one of the fastest growth rates in [[per capita income]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;US Department of State website, [http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1830.htm#econ Background Note: Botswana], May 2009. Retrieved 7-23-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Botswana has transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to a middle-income country. By one estimate, it has the fourth highest [[gross national income]] at [[purchasing power parity]] in Africa, giving it a standard of living around that of Mexico and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Klaus KÃ¤stle |url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/GNI_PPP_of_countries.htm |title=GNI PPP table |publisher=Nationsonline.org |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[economic growth]] averaged over 9% per year from 1966 to 1999. Botswana has a [[List of countries by economic freedom|high level of economic freedom]] compared to other African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botswanaifsc.com/news/botswana_ranked_africas_leader.html |title=Botswana ranked Africa's leader in economic freedom }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has maintained a sound [[fiscal policy]], despite consecutive [[Government budget deficit|budget deficits]] in 2002 and 2003, and a negligible level of [[External debt|foreign debt]]. It earned the highest sovereign [[credit rating]] in Africa and has stockpiled foreign exchange reserves (over $7 billion in 2005/2006) amounting to almost two and a half years of current imports.

[[Debswana]], the largest [[list of diamond mines|diamond mining]] company operating in Botswana, is 50% owned by the government.&lt;ref name=botswana&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/09/business/worldbusiness/09nocera.html?ref=business|title=Diamonds are Forever in Botswana|accessdate=2010-03-15| date=8 August 2008 |author=[[Joe Nocera]]|work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mineral industry provides about 40% of all government revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbankbotswana&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/BOTSWANAEXTN/0,,menuPK:322821~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:322804,00.html | title=Botswana Country Brief | publisher=World Bank }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, significant quantities of uranium were discovered, and mining is projected to begin by 2010. Several international mining corporations have established regional headquarters in Botswana, and prospected for diamonds, gold, uranium, copper, and even oil, many coming back with positive results. Government announced in early 2009, that they would try and shift their economic dependence on diamonds, over serious concern that diamonds are predicted to dry out in Botswana over the next twenty years.

An array of financial institutions populates the countryâs financial system, with pension funds and commercial banks being the two most important segments by asset size. Banks remain profitable, well-capitalized, and liquid, as a result of growing national resources and high interest rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/botswana/botswana-financial-sector-profile.html |title=MFW4A Botswana Financial Sector Profile |publisher=Mfw4a.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botswanaâs competitive banking system is one of Africaâs most advanced.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} Generally adhering to global standards in the transparency of financial policies and banking supervision, the financial sector provides ample access to credit for entrepreneurs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The opening of Capital Bank in 2008 brought the total number of licensed banks to eight.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The government is involved in banking through state-owned financial institutions and a special financial incentives program that is aimed at increasing Botswanaâs status as a financial centre.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Credit is allocated on market terms, although the government provides subsidized loans.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Reform of [[non-bank financial institution]]s has continued in recent years, notably through the establishment of a single financial regulatory agency that provides more effective supervision.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The government has abolished exchange controls, and with the resulting creation of new portfolio investment options, the Botswana Stock Exchange is growing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The constitution prohibits the nationalization of private property and provides for an independent judiciary, and the government respects this in practice. The legal system is sufficient to conduct secure commercial dealings, although a serious and growing backlog of cases prevents timely trials. The protection of intellectual property rights has improved significantly. Botswana is ranked second only to South Africa among sub-Saharan Africa countries in the 2009 International Property Rights Index.

While generally open to foreign participation in its economy, Botswana reserves a number of sectors for citizen participation. Increased foreign investment plays a significant role in the privatization of state-owned enterprises. Investment regulations are transparent, and bureaucratic procedures are streamlined and open, although somewhat slow. Investment returns such as profits and dividends, debt service, capital gains, returns on intellectual property, royalties, franchise's fees, and service fees can be repatriated without limits.

{{Main|Demographics of Botswana}}

Botswana's main ethnic groups are [[Batswana]], [[BaKalanga]], [[Bushmen]] or [[AbaThwa]] also known as Basarwa. Other tribes are [[Bayei]], Bambukushu, [[Basubia]], Baherero and Bakgalagadi. Other groups of ethnicities in Botswana include whites and Indians, both groups being roughly equally small in number. [[Indians in Botswana|Botswana's Indian]] population is made up of many Indian-Africans of several generations, from Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, South Africa, and so on, as well as first generation Indian immigrants. The [[White African|white population]] is native to Botswana or from other parts of Africa including Zimbabwe and South Africa. The white population speaks either English or Afrikaans and makes up roughly 3% of the population.

Since 2000, because of deteriorating economic conditions in Zimbabwe, the number of [[Zimbabweans in Botswana]] has risen into the tens of thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=National and international responses to the Zimbabwean exodus: implications for the refugee protection regime|publisher=Policy Development and Evaluation Service, [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]|series=Research Papers|volume=175|last=Betts|first=Alexander|last2=Kaytaz|first2=Ezra|year=2009|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/retrieveattachments?openagent&amp;shortid=MINE-7UL4R6&amp;file=Full_Report.pdf|format=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fewer than 10,000 Bushmen are still living the traditional [[hunter-gatherer]] style of life. Since the mid-1990s the central government of Botswana has been trying to move [[Bushmen|San]] out of their lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0914_040914_labushmen_2.html African Bushmen Tour U.S. to Fund Fight for Land]. National Geographic News.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's top official on [[indigenous rights]], Prof. [[James Anaya]], has condemned Botswana's persecution of the Bushmen in a report released in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/5600 |title=UN report condemns Botswanaâs treatment of Bushmen |publisher=Survival International |date= |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=33889&amp;Cr=indigenous&amp;Cr1 |title=Challenges faced by Botswanaâs indigenous require Government action â UN expert |publisher=Un.org |date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2010-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Botswana|Setswana}}
[[Image:Khutse Kalahari Lodge.jpg|thumb|A [[rondavel]] at Khutse Kalahari Lodge, Botswana.]]
The official language of Botswana is English although [[Setswana]] is widely spoken across the country. In Setswana [[prefix]]es are more important than they are in many other languages. These prefixes include &quot;Bo&quot;, which refers to the country, &quot;Ba&quot;, which refers to the people, &quot;Mo&quot;, which is one person, and &quot;Se&quot; which is the language. For example, the main tribe of Botswana is the Tswana people, hence the name Botswana for its country. The people as a whole are Batswana, one person is a Motswana, and the language they speak is Setswana.

===Religion===

An estimated 70 percent of the country's citizens identify themselves as Christians. Anglicans, Methodists, and the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa make up the majority of Christians. There are also congregations of Lutherans, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, Baptists, the Dutch Reformed Church, Mennonites, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Christian sects.

According to the 2001 census, the country's [[Muslim]] community, primarily of South Asian origin, numbers slightly more than 5,000. The 2001 census also lists approximately 3,000 [[Hindus]] and 700 [[Baha'is]]. Approximately 20 percent of citizens espouse no religion. Religious services are well attended in both rural and urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90083.htm |title=U.S. Department of State |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
{{Main|Health in Botswana}}
[[Life expectancy]] at birth was 55 in 2009 according to the World Bank, having previously fallen from a peak of 64.1 in 1990 to a low of 49 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=World Bank Botswana Data |url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/botswana | accessdate=2011-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
[[File:Life expectancy in some Southern African countries 1958 to 2003.png|thumb|350px|Life expectancy in several African countries from 1958 to 2003. Botswana had the highest life expectancy until HIV/AIDS began to reduce it in the late 1980s.]]
{{Main|HIV/AIDS in Botswana}}

Like elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, the [[economic impact of AIDS]] is considerable. Economic development spending was cut by 10% in 2002â3 as a result of recurring budget deficits and rising expenditure on healthcare services. [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|Botswana has been hit]] very hard by the [[AIDS pandemic]]; in 2006 it was estimated that [[life expectancy]] at birth had dropped from 65 to 35 years.&lt;ref name=Kallings&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=J Intern Med| year = 2008 | volume = 263 | issue = 3 | pages = 218â43| title=The first postmodern pandemic: 25 years of HIV/AIDS|author=Kallings LO|doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x |pmid=18205765|url= http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01910.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[HIV/AIDS in Botswana|prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Botswana]] was estimated at 24% for adults in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = UNAIDS | url = http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/GlobalReport/2006/ | title = Global Report | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the government began a comprehensive program involving free or cheap generic anti-retroviral drugs as well as an information campaign designed to stop the spread of the virus.  The promiscuous nature of many sexual relationships further impacts the health situation{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}; so much so that it has given rise to a Love Vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Exposing Botswanaâs Love Vocabulary | url=http://drshem.com/2011/06/16/exposing-botswana-love-vocabulary/ | work=Exposing Botswanaâs Love Vocabulary |  accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is unique to the region.

Approximately one in six [[Tswana people|Batswana]] has [[HIV]], giving Botswana the second highest infection rate in the world after nearby [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.avert.org/aidsbotswana.htm HIV and Aids in Botswana | publisher = Avert (International Aids Charity) | accessdate = 2009-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government recognizes that [[AIDS]] will affect the economy and is trying to combat the epidemic, including free [[Antiretroviral drug|anti-retroviral drug]] treatment and a nation-wide Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission program. Botswana has reduced HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children from about 40% to just 4%.

===Cancer===
The [[Cancer Association of Botswana]] is a voluntary [[non-governmental organization]]. The association is a member of the Union for International Cancer Control. The Association supplements existing services through provision of [[cancer]] prevention and health awareness programmes, facilitating access to health services for cancer patients and offering support and counseling to those affected.&lt;ref name=&quot;UICC Cancer Association of Botswana&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Union for International Cancer Control |url=http://www.uicc.org/membership/cancer-association-botswana |title=UCII page for Cancer Association of Botswana), retrieved 2010-11-5 |publisher=Uicc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[Image:University of Botswana dorms.jpg|thumb|Residence hall of the [[University of Botswana]] in Gaborone, Botswana]]
{{Main|Education in Botswana}}

Botswana has made great strides in educational development since independence in 1966{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. At that time there were very few graduates in the country and only a very small percentage of the population attended secondary school. Botswana increased its adult literacy rate from 69% in 1991 to 83% in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org |title=UNESCO Institute for Statistics |publisher=Stats.uis.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the discovery of diamonds and the increase in government revenue that this brought, there was a huge increase in educational provision in the country. All students were guaranteed ten years of basic education, leading to a Junior Certificate qualification. Approximately half of the school population attends a further two years of secondary schooling leading to the award of the [[Botswana General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (BGCSE). Secondary education in Botswana is neither free nor compulsory.

After leaving school, students can attend one of the six technical colleges in the country, or take vocational training courses in [[teaching]] or [[nursing]]. The best students enter the [[University of Botswana]], [[Botswana College of Agriculture]] [http://www.bca.bw], and The [[Botswana Accountancy College]] in Gaborone. Many other students end up in the numerous private tertiary education colleges around the country. A high majority of these students are government sponsored. A larger influx of tertiary students is expected when construction of the nation's second international university, The [[Botswana International University of Science and Technology]], is completed in [[Palapye]].

One notable [[International]] [[University]] is [[Limkokwing University of Creative Technology]] that offers various [[Associate Degree]](s) in [[Creative Arts]]. This has helped many youths develop and create their own businesses across the country.

The quantitative gains have not always been matched by qualitative ones. Primary schools in particular still lack resources, and the teachers are less well paid than their secondary school colleagues. The Botswana Ministry of Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.bw/index.php?id=10 |title=Ministry of Education and Skills Development: Home |publisher=Moe.gov.bw |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is working to establish libraries in primary schools in partnership with the [[African Library Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanlibraryproject.org/about-us/our-partners/139-library-partner-botswana-ministry-of-education |title=Library Partner â Botswana Ministry of Education |publisher=Africanlibraryproject.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Botswana]] hopes that by investing a large part of national income in education, the country will become less dependent on diamonds for its economic survival, and less dependent on expatriates for its skilled workers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Botswana invests 21% of its government spending in education.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref&quot; /&gt;

In January 2006, Botswana announced the reintroduction of school fees after two decades of free state education&lt;ref&gt;BBC News website, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4601360.stm Botswana brings back school fees]. Retrieved 2009-23-7.&lt;/ref&gt; though the government still provides full scholarships with living expenses to any Botswana citizen in university, either at the University of Botswana or if the student wishes to pursue an education in any field not offered locally, such as medicine, they are provided with a full scholarship to study abroad.

==Sports==
{{See also|Botswana at the Olympics}}
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Botswana, been the qualification for the [[African Cup]] 2012 its highest achievement. Other popular sports are [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[softball]], [[team handball|handball]], [[golf]] and [[track and field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20060126|title=Sparks to fly at Diamond|publisher=Botswana Press Agency (BOPA)|accessdate=2008-01-18}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20040813|title=Opinion the Academic World|publisher=Botswana Press Agency (BOPA)|accessdate=2008-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061003050400/http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20040813 |archivedate = 3 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botswana is an associate member of the [[International Cricket Council]].

Botswana has yet to win a medal at the Olympics, but in 2011 [[Amantle Montsho]] became [[2011 World Championships in Athletics â Women's 400 metres|world champion]] in the 400 metres and won Botswanas first [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] medal on world level.  Another famous Botswana athlete is high jumper [[Kabelo Kgosiemang]], three times [[African Championships in Athletics|African champion]].

The card game [[Contract bridge|bridge]] has a strong following; it was first played in Botswana over 30 years ago and grew in popularity during the 1980s. Many British expatriate school teachers informally taught the game in Botswanaâs secondary schools. The Botswana Bridge Federation (BBF) was founded in 1988 and continues to organize tournaments. Bridge has remained popular and the BBF has over 800 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnsc.co.bw/affiliates/bridge_federation.htm|title=Botswana Bridge Federation|publisher=Botswana National Sports Council|accessdate=2008-05-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080227184536/http://www.bnsc.co.bw/affiliates/bridge_federation.htm |archivedate = 27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the BBF invited the [[English Bridge Union]] to host a week-long teaching program in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/news/2008/BotswanaTrip.htm|title=English Bridge Union|publisher=English Bridge Union|accessdate=2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[File:Tsodilo Hills rock paintings4.jpg|thumb|Rock paintings of [[Tsodilo Hills]]]]
{{Main|Culture of Botswana}}

Besides referring to the language of the dominant people groups in Botswana, Setswana is the adjective used to describe the rich cultural traditions of the Batswana-whether construed as members of the Tswana ethnic groups or of all citizens of Botswana.
The Scottish writer, Alexander McCall Smith, has written a number of popular novels ([[No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]] series) about Botswana that entertain as well as inform the reader about the culture and customs of Botswana.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Botswana}}
Tswana music is mostly vocal and performed without drums; it also makes heavy use of string instruments. Tswana folk music has instruments such as Setinkane, Segankure/Segaba, and for the last few decades, the guitar has been celebrated as a versatile music instrument for Tswana music.

===Visual arts===
{{Main|Art of Botswana}}
In the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of [[Etsha]] and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting [[basket]]s from [[Mokola Palm]] and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage, large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through color use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.

Other notable artistic communities include [[Thamaga Pottery]] and [[Oodi Weavers]], both located in the southeastern part of Botswana.

The oldest paintings from both Botswana and South Africa depict hunting, animal and human figures, and were made by the Khoisan (!Kung San/[[Bushmen]]) over twenty thousand years ago within the [[Kalahari]] desert.

In addition to these more traditional arts there are a number of extremely talented artists who use modern means to express themselves. There are a few galleries around Botswana that display paintings and sculptures. Some pieces are inspired by the beautiful Botswana landscapes and others by the people themselves.

===Cuisine===
[[Image:Boerewors raw.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Boerewors]]]]
{{Main|Cuisine of Botswana}}
The cuisine of Botswana is unique but also shares some characteristics with other cuisine of [[Southern Africa]]. Examples of Botswana food are [[Pap (food)|Pap]], [[Boerewors]], [[Samp]], [[Vetkoek]] and [[Mopane worms]]. A food unique to Botswana includes [[Seswaa]], heavily [[salted]] mashed-up [[meat]].
