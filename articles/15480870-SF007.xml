'''TinyMe''' is a lightweight [[Unity Linux]]-based [[operating system]], using the [[Openbox]] window manager. It is aimed at making the computing experience as bloat- and lag-free as possible and is well-suited to older computers, enthusiasts devoted to small/fast systems, or users who just want a minimal [[environment (computing)|environment]]. TinyMe is comparable to other [[lightweight Linux distribution]]s like [[Puppy Linux]], [[Damn Small Linux]] and [[Feather Linux]].

The distribution produces two Live CD ISO images. The larger, codenamed &quot;Acorn&quot;, is a 200 MB ISO image. The other, &quot;Droplet&quot;, is a 150 MB ISO image. Both can be installed onto a hard drive or a [[USB flash drive]].

== History ==
The project started in November 2006. Development took place between several members of the MyPCLinuxOS website until KDulcimer took over in April 2007.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The first stable version of TinyMe was released in May 2008. Development continued on the MyPCLinuxOS forum with other MyPCLinuxOS projects until September 2007, when the TinyMe project moved to its own subdomain of MyPCLinuxOS. In September 2008, TinyMe moved to its own site hosted off MyPCLinuxOS. Its second release was codenamed &quot;Droplet&quot; and released December 2008, as a 150 MB ISO.

On 11 March 2009, TinyMe's developer announced a split from [[PCLinuxOS]].
