'''Keauna Inaba'''&lt;ref&gt;Her middle name is given as Inaba in various USFSA documents. An example of one is {{PDFlink|[http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/laurels%20gold%20web%20june%2007.pdf the published announcement of those who passed gold-level tests]}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' McLaughlin''' (born September 25, 1992) is an [[United States|American]] [[pair skater]]. Her former pairs partner was [[Rockne Brubaker]]. With him, she is the 2008 &amp; 2009 [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships|U.S. National Champion]], the 2010 [[Four Continents Championships|Four Continents silver medalist]], and the [[2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Junior Champion]].

{{As of|2010|06}}, they were ranked 7th in the world by the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isuresults.com/ws/wspairs.htm | title = ISU World Standings for Figure Skating and Ice Dance : Pairs | publisher = [[International Skating Union]] | date = 6 April 2010 | accessdate = 06 April 2010 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Keauna McLaughlin was born in [[Tarzana, California]]. She moved to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] to train and attends [[Cheyenne Mountain High School]]. Her name is based on a [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word for &quot;feminine wind running through the forest&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;alongway&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= Philip |last= Hersh |title= Keauna McLaughlin, Rockne Brubaker have come a long way |url= http://www.calendarlive.com/la-spw-figure-skating21-2009jan21,0,4157372.story |work= |publisher= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 21 January 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother, Lei Ina, was a senior-level pair skater&lt;ref name=st010307&gt;{{cite news |first= J. Barry |last= Mittan |title= Brubaker Back on Top with New Partner|url= http://www.skatetoday.com/2007/01/03/brubaker-back-on-top-with-new-partner/ |publisher= SkateToday |date= 3 January 2007 |accessdate=8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and skated professionally as a [[ice show|show skater]] with [[Disney on Ice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Troy |last = Schwindt | url = http://spokane2007.usfigureskating.org/News/RecapNews/012307BrubakerMcLaughlinInLead.aspx | title = Brubaker and McLaughlin Continue Impressive Inaugural Season | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | date = 23 January 2007 | accessdate = 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father left the family when she was a toddler.&lt;ref name=&quot;alongway&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
McLaughlin began skating at the age of four.&lt;ref name=st010307/&gt;&lt;ref name=usoc011410&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.teamusa.org/news/2010/01/14/making-team-usa-rockne-brubaker-and-keauna-mclaughlin/30555 | title = Making Team USA: Rockne Brubaker and Keauna McLaughlin | last = Shinn | first = Peggy  |date = January 14, 2010 | work = [[United States Olympic Committee|TeamUSA.org]] | accessdate = June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She originally competed in [[single skating]]. As a singles skater, she is the 2006 U.S. Juvenile silver medalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Troy | last = Schwindt  | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_story.asp?id=32272 | title = Dreams Come True for U.S. Juvenile and Intermediate Champions | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | date = 5 December 2005 | accessdate = 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She began [[pair skating]] at age 10&lt;ref name=st010307/&gt; and focused entirely on pair skating when she teamed up with Brubaker.

With partner [[Ethan Burgess]], McLaughlin won two consecutive medals at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]]: the bronze medal at the novice level at the [[2004 United States Figure Skating Championships|2004 U.S. Championships]] and the pewter medal at the junior level at the [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships|2005 U.S. Championships]]. Her partner was too old for the Junior Grand Prix circuit so they split and she skated on her own for a while.&lt;ref name=seventeen&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.seventeen.com/health/fitness/keauna-rockne-figure-skaters-video | title = Meet Olympic Ice Skating Pair Keauna McLaughlin and Rockne Brubaker | last =  | first =  |date = November 15, 2009 | work = [[Seventeen (magazine)]] | accessdate = June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Rockne Brubaker]]'s previous partnership ended due to a lack of height difference, his coach [[Dalilah Sappenfield]] called McLaughlin, whom she had seen competing at other events, and arranged a try-out.&lt;ref name=st010307/&gt; McLaughlin and Brubaker teamed up in May 2006.&lt;ref name=gs042009&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2008/042009.shtml | title = Health Problems Don't Hamper U.S. Pairs Champs  | last = Mittan | first = J. Barry |date = April 20, 2009 | publisher = GoldenSkate | accessdate = June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McLaughlin relocated from California to Colorado Springs.&lt;ref name=usoc011410/&gt; 

The pair went undefeated in their first competitive season together (2006â2007). In that season, they competed on the [[2006-2007 ISU Junior Grand Prix]] circuit and won both their events and the Junior Grand Prix Final. They went on to win the Junior title at both the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 U.S. Championships]] and the [[2007 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Junior Championships]]. McLaughlin and Brubaker were the fourth American pair team in history to win the World Junior title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Salvatore | last = Zanca | url = http://www.usfsa.org/event_story.asp?id=37826 | title = McLaughlin and Brubaker Skate Away with World Junior Pairs Title | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | date = 28 February 2007 | accessdate = 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the age difference between McLaughlin and Brubaker, this was their only junior-age-eligible season.

McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2007-2008 season on the [[2007-2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] circuit at the [[2007 Cup of China]], where they won the silver medal. They won a second silver medal at the [[2007 NHK Trophy]]. Their success at these two competitions qualified them for the [[2007â2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2007â2008 Grand Prix Final]], but they withdrew after the short program due to an injury to Brubaker.

Later that season, they competed at the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]] and won the senior national title, becoming the first U.S. pairs team in 51 years to win consecutive junior and senior national titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jo Ann | last= Schneider Farris | url = http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080216&amp;content_id=44006&amp;vkey=ice_news | title = McLaughlin, Brubaker believe in themselves | publisher = IceNetwork | date = 16 February 2008 | accessdate = 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite winning the U.S. Championships, McLaughlin and Brubaker were not assigned to the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championship]] team or the [[2008 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championship]] team due to ISU age restrictions. McLaughlin was too young for senior ISU championships and Brubaker was too old for the World Junior Championships. McLaughlin and Brubaker's win, combined with the wins of [[Jessica Rose Paetsch]] &amp; [[Jon Nuss]] on the junior level, and [[Brynn Carman]] &amp; [[Christopher Knierim]] on the novice level, gave their coach Dalilah Sappenfield a sweep of national pair champions for 2008, an accomplishment which led to Sappenfield being named Coach of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usfsa.org/Story.asp?id=41536 | title = U.S. Figure Skating and PSA Announce Coaches of the Year | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | date = 4 June 2008 | accessdate = 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2008-2009 season at the [[2008 Skate America]], where they won the silver medal. A week later they competed at the [[2008 Skate Canada International]], where they won the bronze medal. At the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 U.S. Championships]], McLaughlin and Brubaker successfully defended their national title, which resulted in them being selected to compete at the [[2009 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2009 Four Continents]] and the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|2009 Worlds]]. They placed 5th at Four Continents and 11th at the World Championships.

In May 2009, McLaughlin and Brubaker changed coaches to [[John Nicks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=43073 | title = Two-time U.S. Pairs Champions McLaughlin and Brubaker Announce Coaching Change | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | date = 22 May 2009 | accessdate = 22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relocated to California.&lt;ref name=vanityfair&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/01/psyched-out-pairs-skaters-keauna-mclaughlin-and-rockne-brubakers-disastrous-olympic-trials.html | title = Psyched Out: Pairs Skaters Keauna McLaughlin and Rockne Brubaker's Disastrous Olympic Trials | last = Hanel | first = Marnie |date = January 20, 2010 | work = [[Vanity Fair (magazine)]] | accessdate = June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McLaughlin and Brubaker began the 2009-2010 season at the [[2009 Cup of Russia]], where they won the bronze medal. They continued their season at the [[2009 Skate America]], where they placed 4th. As the top American pair team on the international circuit, McLaughlin and Brubaker entered the [[2010 United States Figure Skating Championships|2010 U.S. Championships]] as the favorites to win their third consecutive national title and secure one of the two pair skating berths on the U.S. Olympic team. Despite several days of strong practices, they delivered an uncharacteristically rough short program, including falls on a triple salchow and a freak fall on a death spiral, leaving them in 7th place.&lt;ref name=vanityfair/&gt; The pair was able to move up to 5th place after the long program but it was not enough to win a place on the Olympic team.&lt;ref name=sp011710&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2010/jan/17/brubaker-mclaughlin-left-off-team/ | title = Brubaker, McLaughlin left off team | last = Blanchette | first = John | last2 = Trimmer | first2 = Dave |date = January 17, 2010 | work = The Spokesman-Review | accessdate = June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determined to rebound from their National Championship result, McLaughlin and Brubaker competed at the [[2010 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|2010 Four Continents]] less than ten days later. There, they recorded a personal best score in the short program and ultimately won the silver medal.  

On June 22, 2010, McLaughlin announced the end of her partnership with Brubaker.&lt;ref name=mclbrusplit&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=44747 | title = Two-Time U.S. Pairs Champions Keauna McLaughlin And Rockne Brubaker Announce End Of Partnership | last =  | first =  |date = June 22, 2010 | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | accessdate = June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-eligible career==
In 2010 she was cast on [[Skating with the Stars]] as a skating pro. Her partner was [[Brandon Mychal Smith]].
