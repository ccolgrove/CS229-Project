'''Hildon''' is an [[application framework]] originally developed for mobile devices ([[PDA]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, etc.) running the [[Linux]] [[operating system]].  It was developed by [[Nokia]] for the [[Maemo]] operating system and is now a part of [[GNOME]].  It focuses on providing a finger-friendly interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/06/14/nokia-pushes-hildon-upstream Nokia Pushes Hildon Upstream]&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily a set of [[GTK+]] extensions that provide mobile-deviceâoriented functionality, but also provides a [[desktop environment]] that includes a task navigator for opening and switching between programs, a control panel for user settings, and status bar, task bar and home applets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maemo.org/maemo_release_documentation/maemo4.1.x/node6.html#SECTION00624000000000000000 Maemo Diablo 4.1 release documentation] - 5.2.4 Hildon Framework&lt;/ref&gt; It is standard on the [[Maemo]] platform used by the [[Nokia Internet Tablet]]s and the [[Nokia N900]] [[smartphone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maemo.org/development/documentation/tutorials/Maemo_tutorial_bora.html maemo Tutorial Bora]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildon has also been selected as the framework for [[Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded Edition]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MobileAndEmbedded/HildonDesktopManualProcedure Hildon Desktop Manual Procedure]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hildon]] was an early instance of a [[software platform]] for generic computing in a tablet device intended for internet consumption. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/21/nokia_hildon_the_great_lost_platform/|title=Nokia's Great Lost Platform
|author=Andrew Orlowski|publisher=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Nokia didn't commit to it as their only platform for their future mobile devices and the project competed against other in-house platforms. The strategic advantage of a modern platform was not exploited, being displaced by the [[Series 60]].

== Components ==
The Hildon framework includes components that effectively provide a [[desktop environment]].

=== Hildon Application Manager ===
Hildon Application Manager is the Hildon graphical package manager, it uses the [[Debian]] package management tools APT ([[Advanced Packaging Tool]] and [[dpkg]]) and provides a graphical interface for installing, updating and removing packages. It is a limited package manager, designed specifically for end-users, in that it doesn't directly offer the user access to system files and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hildon-app-mgr.garage.maemo.org/index.html Hildon Application Manager] - Overview&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Internet Tablet OS#Diablo|Diablo release]] of Maemo, Hildon Application Manager now supports &quot;Seamless Software Update&quot; (SSU), which implements a variety of features to allow system upgrades to be easily performed through it.

=== Hildon Control Panel ===
Hildon Control Panel is the user settings interface for Hildon. It provides simple access to control panels used to change system settings.

=== Hildon Desktop ===
Hildon Desktop is the primary UI component of Hildon, so makes up the bulk of what a user will see as &quot;Hildon&quot;. It controls application launching and switching, general system control, and provides interfaces for task bar (application menu and task switcher), status bar (brightness and volume control), and home (internet radio and web search) applets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://umeguide.net/C/hildondesktop.html Ubuntu Documentation] - Hildon Desktop&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hildon Library ===
The Hildon library, originally developed by [[Nokia]] but since Maemo 5, developed by [[Igalia]] and [[Lanedo]] (who developed [http://live.gnome.org/Maemo/ MaemoGTK+], the Maemo version of [[Gtk]]). It is a set of mobile specific GTK+ widgets for applications in Maemo. Up to Maemo 4, these widgets were designed for stylus usage. However, in Maemo 5, most widgets were deprecated and new widgets for direct finger manipulation were introduced, including a kinetic panning container.
