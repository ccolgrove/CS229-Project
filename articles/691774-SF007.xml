'''Recovery Is Possible''' ('''RIPLinux''') is a small, specialized [[Linux distribution]] based on [[Slackware]]{{Ref label|Distrowatch|2|a}} that includes system maintenance and recovery applications on a [[Live CD|live CD or USB flash drive]]{{Ref label|Freshmeat|1|a}}{{Ref label|Distrowatch|2|a}}. The RIP disc comes in two flavors: one with the [[X Window System]] and one without.  The X-capable version does not require X to be started at boot-up; it can be started at any time after booting without the server.  The main purpose of X under RIP is to provide the capability to run [[GParted]], a [[disk partition]] management program, and [[Mozilla Firefox]], a [[web browser]]. [[Xine]] is also included for watching movies on DVD.

Common uses of RIP include: {{Ref label|Linuxmagazine|3|a}}
* [[TestDisk]] to recover deleted partitions, by ignoring the [[master boot record|MBR]] and checking cylinders for known filesystem structures (such as FAT, NTFS, ext2/3/4, ReiserFS 3/4, XFS, etc.)
* [[PhotoRec]] to recover deleted files (not only photos) by ignoring the filesystem and checking disk blocks for known file types
* [[fdisk]], [[cfdisk]], [[parted]], and [[GParted]] (with the X11 version) for partition management
* [[ntfsprogs]] ([[ntfsresize]], [[ntfsclone]], ntfsfix, mkntfs, etc.) in order to resize, backup/restore, schedule a [[CHKDSK]] at Windows boot-up, and perform other operations on NTFS filesystems
* GNU [[ddrescue]] to recover data from failed media by copying data from one file or block device (hard disk, CD-ROM, floppy, etc.) to another, trying hard to rescue data in case of read errors.
