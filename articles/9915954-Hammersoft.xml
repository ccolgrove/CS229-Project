The following is a listing of officially released works by the English band [[Porcupine Tree]]. The band has released ten major studio albums, as well as many EP's, limited editions, and revamped material.

At the time [[Steven Wilson]] was going to sign to the [[Delerium Records|Delerium]] label, he owned a lot of material recorded during the mid and later 80's that he had recorded subsequently on three demo tapes - ''[[Tarquin's Seaweed Farm]]'', ''[[Love, Death &amp; Mussolini]]'' and ''[[The Nostalgia Factory]]''. He sent copies of those tapes to people he felt would be interested in the recordings, asking them to spread the word. Delerium originally intended to release all of that material in a double debut album, but Wilson decided to just pick the songs he considered the best ones. These songs were mastered to make Porcupine Tree's first studio album, ''[[On the Sunday of Life|On the Sunday of Life...]]'' (1991); all of the leftover tracks would be later released on a compilation album called ''[[Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape]]'' (1994).

[[Richard Barbieri]] and [[Colin Edwin]] met Steven Wilson to play on a few songs he was working on. Again, there was an amount of songs written that would perfectly fit on a double album, but one of these songs saw the light prior to the release of their second studio album on the ''[[Voyage 34]]'' (1992) [[Single (music)|single]], thereafter followed by ''[[Voyage 34: Remixes]]'' (1993), and the other material ended up on the ''[[Staircase Infinities]]'' (1994) [[Extended play|EP]]. Finally, ten tracks were chosen for their next studio album, ''[[Up the Downstair]]'' (1993), which ''[[Melody Maker]]'' described as &quot;a psychedelic masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Snapper Music&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.snappermusic.com/ms/porcupinetree/|title =Porcupine Tree's Digital Releases| accessdate =2008-02-02}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 1993, [[Chris Maitland]] joined the band for live shows and would later record some drums and percussions for three songs of Porcupine Tree's third studio album, ''[[The Sky Moves Sideways]]'' (1995), an album that made the press refer them as the &quot;[[Pink Floyd]] of the nineties&quot;. They did not record as a full band until ''[[Signify]]'' (1996), the first Porcupine Tree album to be performed entirely by the four members. It contained shorter compositions and less improvisations than its predecessors.

The next album was delayed for almost three years as the band was looking for a new record label after finishing their deal with Delerium. In the meantime they launched ''[[Metanoia (Porcupine Tree album)|Metanoia]]'' (1998), a compilation of improvisations recorded during the ''Signify'' sessions, some of which were later shaped into songs. Finally, they signed to [[Snapper Music|Snapper]]/K-Scope and the album ''[[Stupid Dream]]'' (1999) was issued. The album was a departure in style from all their previous works, in favour a more song-oriented direction, as a consequence this alienated some older fans but brought a lot of new ones. Its follow-up, ''[[Lightbulb Sun]]'' (2000), assured the fan based and solidified the ground of its predecessor. For this one, they worked with [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]] of [[XTC]], who provided string arrangements. A collection of EP tracks and out-takes from the previous two albums was launched a year after under the title of ''[[Recordings (album)|Recordings]]'' (2001).

''[[In Absentia]]'' (2002) turned out to be one of their most successful works to date, remaining a favourite to many fans, charting in many European countries and selling over 100.000 copies in its first year of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innerviews.org/inner/ptree.html Innerviews-Pt]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Deadwing]]'' (2005) appeared the [[Billboard chart]] at #132 of the [[Billboard 200]]&lt;ref name=&quot;The Billboard 200 - Deadwing&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=141384&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=907704

Porcupine Tree's next studio album, ''[[Fear of a Blank Planet]]'' (2007), debuted at #59 on the Billboard 200,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Billboard 200 - Fear of a Blank Planet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=141384&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=907704

On 2007 they collaborated with [[Yoko Ono]] on the song &quot;Death of Samantha&quot;, in Ono's remix album ''[[Yes, I'm a Witch]]''.

In September 2007, they released ''[[Nil Recurring]]'', an EP of four leftover tracks from the recording sessions for ''Fear of a Blank Planet''. It was released on [[Transmission (record label)|Transmission]], the band's own record label as a limited edition of 5000 copies that did not take long to sell out through the band's online store, [[Burning Shed]], forcing the band to keep printing more copies. Nevertheless, the EP was reissued on February 18, 2008 on [[Peaceville Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://theseaweedfarm.blogspot.com/2007/11/nil-recurring-on-peaceville-records.html|title =The Seaweed Farm: Nil Recurring on Peaceville Records| accessdate =2007-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An in-store appearance at Park Avenue CDs in [[Orlando, Florida]] from October 4, 2007, was recorded and released on [[CD]] under the name of ''[[We Lost The Skyline]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://theseaweedfarm.blogspot.com/2008/02/nil-recurring-and-we-lost-skyline.html|title =The Seaweed Farm: Nil Recurring and We Lost The Skyline released today!| accessdate =2008-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title is a reference to the lyrics on &quot;[[The Sky Moves Sideways|The Sky Moves Sideways (Phase One)]]&quot;. The album was released on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] on March 21, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://theseaweedfarm.blogspot.com/2008/03/we-lost-skyline-vinyl-edition.html|title =The Seaweed Farm: We Lost The Skyline vinyl edition| accessdate =2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the first official acoustic live record to be officially released by the band.

A live album from the ''Fear of a Blank Planet'' tour, ''[[Ilosaarirock (album)|Ilosaarirock]]'', was released in March 2009. It was recorded from their performance at the [[Ilosaarirock|Ilosaarirock Festival]] on July 14, 2007. However, this album was only released to members of the Residents of a Blank Planet ticketing club.

On September 15, 2009, the band's tenth studio album was released, titled ''[[The Incident (album)|The Incident]]'', resulting in the best ranked Porcupine Tree album in the world charts to date.

Another live album from the ''Fear of a Blank Planet'' tour, ''[[Atlanta (album)|Atlanta]]'', was released in June 2010 in order to help raise funds for [[Mick Karn]]'s treatment for cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.burningshed.com/store/porcupinetree/product/94/2213/| title =Porcupine Tree â Atlanta| accessdate =2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|A special edition has been made available in April, with a regular version following in May. Anesthetize was filmed live over 2 nights in Tilburg, The Netherlands in October 2008, at the end of the Fear of a Blank Planet tour. The 130 minute live film includes a complete performance of the Blank Planet album and 11 other tracks, and was directed and edited by Lasse Hoile on high definition cameras, with the soundtrack mixed into stereo and 5.1 sound.

The book includes both a DVD and a much higher quality Blu-ray disc version of the film, as well as 2 audio CDs of the soundtrack including one bonus track not featured in the film.

|1989&lt;br&gt;1991
| align=&quot;center&quot;| â&lt;br&gt;Delerium
|Cassette
|Most of these tracks appeared either on the album ''On the Sunday of Life...'' or the limited edition CD ''Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape''. However, for the CD issue tracks 3 and 4/5 were retitled &quot;Third Eye Surfer&quot; and &quot;On the Sunday of Life...&quot; respectively. Also the version of &quot;Mute&quot; here is an earlier mix.
|-
|''[[Love, Death &amp; Mussolini]]''
|1990

|Cassette
|40 minute tape private pressing of only 10 copies. Contains 7 tracks later to appear on ''The Nostalgia Factory'', plus &quot;Out&quot; (later included on the vinyl edition of ''Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape'') and the elsewhere unavailable &quot;It Will Rain for a Million Years&quot; (a completely different track to the one with the same title included on ''On the Sunday of Life...'')
|-
|''[[The Nostalgia Factory]]''
|1990&lt;br&gt;1991
| align=&quot;center&quot;| â&lt;br&gt;Delerium
|Cassette
|Most of these tracks appeared either on the album ''On the Sunday of Life...'' or the limited edition CD ''Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape''. &quot;Colours Dance Angels Kiss&quot; and &quot;Hokey Cokey&quot; were later retitled &quot;Track 11&quot; and &quot;Execution of the Will of the Marquis de Sade&quot; respectively. &quot;The Nostalgia Factory&quot; is an earlier version to that on ''On the Sunday of Life...'' and &quot;Queen Quotes Crowley&quot; and &quot;This Long Silence&quot; are both about a minute longer than the versions later released on CD. An edit of the track &quot;Sinatra Rape Scene&quot; appears on ''Up the Downstair'' as &quot;Monuments Burn into Moments&quot;.
|-
|''[[Spiral Circus - Live]]''
|April, 1994&lt;br&gt;February, 1997

|1994&lt;br&gt;February, 2000
|Magic Gnome&lt;br&gt;Gates of Dawn
|CD&lt;br&gt;2LP
|&quot;The Cross&quot; which appeared on the original CD edition was replaced by the track &quot;Out&quot; (from 1987) on the vinyl edition.
The version of &quot;Radioactive Toy&quot; here is the original cassette version as opposed to the re-recorded and extended version on ''On the Sunday of Life...''. &quot;Mute&quot; is a newer mix to the one on the cassette. &quot;An Empty Box&quot; had not appeared on either cassette but is another recording from the same period.
Note that the vinyl edition corrects some factual errors and therefore dates some of the material back to 1984.
