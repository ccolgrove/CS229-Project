The '''first elections for the [[European Parliament]]''' in [[Italy]] were held on 10 June 1979.

A week before Italy had voted for its [[Italian general election, 1979|general election]]: the lack of matching between the two elections caused much controversy for wasting public money.

==Electoral system==
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] was the traditional electoral system of the Italian Republic since its foundation in 1946, so it was naturally adopted to elect the Italian representatives to the European Parliament. Two levels were used: a national level to divide seats between parties, and a constituency level to distribute them between candidates. [[Italian region]]s were united in 5 constituencies, each electing a group of deputies. At national level, seats were divided between party lists using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Hare quota]]. All seats gained by each party were automatically distributed to their local [[open list]]s and their most voted candidates.

== Results ==
This election taking place just a week after the general election, it obviously gave a similar result. However, the minor importance of the European ballot caused a smaller turnout, which particularly punished the two major parties, the [[Italian Christian Democracy|Christian Democracy]] and the [[Italian Communist Party]]. Especially little [[Italian Liberal Party]] had a breath of fresh air from this vote, quite doubling its percentage than seven days before.
