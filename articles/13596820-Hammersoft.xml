==Disney rebrand==
After [[Disney XD]] successfully launched on February 13, 2009 in the US, the [[Disney-ABC Television]] Group re-branded Jetix France to Disney XD on April 1, 2009 and it was expected to be rolled out to other European territories in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney XD&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, Disney announced that the Jetix channel in certain countries (namely [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Bulgaria]]) will be renamed to [[The Disney Channel]], marking that channel's first introduction in these countries. The change happened at September 19, 2009. &lt;ref name=&quot;Disney Channel&quot;&gt;[http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/?p=18685 Jetix to become Disney] - ''Broadband TV News'', by Chris Dziadul, published and retrieved: 2009-05-26&lt;/ref&gt; Disney Channel Romania &amp; Bulgaria broadcast as a single video feed with two audio channels.

The current Disney Channel has [[Serbian language|Serbian]] subtitles, it is also possible that the Disney Channel will be made available in [[Serbia]] as well.
&lt;!--After the rebranding, the channel will divide into many tv channels : Disney Channel : [[Bulgaria]],[[Croatia]],[[Estonia]],[[Kazahstan]],[[Romania]],[[Russia]] and [[Serbia]].
[[Disney Channel Romania]] will air in Romania and [[Moldova]].--&gt;

Jetix Central and Eastern Europe was re branded as [[The Disney Channel]] from the 19th September 2009 according to a run of advertisements on the channel announcing the change.

Jetix Russia was based on ''[[Jetix (Central and Eastern Europe)]]'', but all things related to Disney were automatically replaced with Jetix promos&lt;ref&gt;&lt;small&gt;http://www.telemaniac.com/jetix-bgro ''ÐÐ¶ÐµÑÐ¸ÐºÑ ÑÐµ ÑÐ²ÐµÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ¸ Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐµ Ð½Ð° ÐÐ¸ÑÐ½Ð¸ Ð² ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¸ Ð ÑÐ¼ÑÐ½Ð¸Ñ'' (translation: ''Jetix to air more Disney programming in Romania'') (in Bulgarian); retrieved August 20, 2008.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;,. Certain shows which then did not air on the regular Jetix CEE ([[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]], [[Iggy Arbuckle]]) were part of the hour-and-a-half long programming block that replaced the Disney block. When [[Jetix (Central and Eastern Europe)|Jetix CEE]] was changed to [[Disney Channel (Central and Eastern Europe)|Disney Channel CEE]], the [[Russian language]] transmission ceased. ''Jetix Russia'', now as a separate channel, continues to exist for the time being.
On August 10, 2010 Jetix Russia was replaced by [[Disney Channel Russia]]
