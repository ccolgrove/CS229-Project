==History==
[[File:Nickelodeon logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|Nick logo used November 6, 1998 to February 12, 2010 in Asia.]] 
In November 1998, Nickelodeon decided to reach the popular channel to the [[Philippines]], [[Japan]] &amp; [[Russia]] as an attempt to bring the popular channel to Asia. In 2003, it became a part of Nicksplat (Nickelodeon's headquarters in Asia).

In October 11, 2006, [[Viacom]]'s subsidiary [[MTV Networks]] Asia Pacific set up a new unit to manage [[Nickelodeon South East Asia]] TV based in [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viacom.com/view_release.jhtml;jsessionid=APLJH3MQVAW1CCQBAFLA4CY?inID=10000007&amp;inReleaseID=227417 &quot;MTV Networks Asia Pacific Announces A New Structure To Advance Its Localization Strategy&quot;], Viacom, 11 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nickelodeon was launched in [[Singapore]] and expanded its services in [[Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]], and [[Polynesia]]. In the present, Nickelodeon [[Philippines]] , Nickelodeon [[Pakistan]], and  Nickelodeon [[India]] started working independently. They started their new website, [http://www.nicksplat.com Nicksplat.com] in 2003. 

In March 15, 2010, Nickelodeon revamped their logo same as the [[United States]] and worldwide and started broadcasting newer Nickelodeon shows from the United States that represents the new Nickelodeon logo and airs latest episodes of current Nick shows.

In April 1, 2011, the Nickelodeon channel in the [[Philippines]] was replaced with a dedicated Filipino feed. In April 11, 2011, the lineup was changed prior to Nickelodeon Southeast Asia. The new schedule will put live-action programs in the primetime slot and will double the [[Nick Jr.]] block.

On July 1, 2011, the Nick Jr. block on the South East Asia feed was removed. This is because the current [[Nick Jr. (South East Asia)|Nick. Jr]] channel which launched in [[Singapore|Singapore's]] [[StarHub TV]] on May 18, 2011 was rated the number one channel for the highest average time spent to watch the channel by kids aged 4 to 14 for the first quarter of 2011 in Singapore. Due to the increasing preschool audience, there is also an increasing demand for a 24-hour preschool channel, therefore causing the removal of the block. The new Nick Jr. channel is available in South east asia .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nick-asia.com/nickjr/faq.php Nick. Jr Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;
