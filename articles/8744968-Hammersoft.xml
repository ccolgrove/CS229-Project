}}'''Frontier Telephone of Rochester, Inc.''', formerly '''Rochester Telephone Corporation''', is a local telephone operating company of [[Frontier Communications]] providing telephone service to [[Rochester, New York|Rochester, NY]]. The company was founded in [[1994]].

In 1995, the original Rochester Telephone Corporation renamed itself Frontier Corporation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secinfo.com/dSY56.87.d.htm SEC filing (see third paragraph of press release)]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to sound less âlocalâ in the newly competitive landscape. Frontier transferred its Rochester local telephone lines to the &quot;new&quot; Rochester Telephone Corporation. Frontier's investment in fiber long lines proved attractive in the exploding global communications market in the late 1990s when RTC was acquired in 1999 by Global Crossing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalrecord.com/article.cfm?recid=28902 The Journal Record article]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4182/is_19990318/ai_n10125120 Journal Record article at Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, a Bermuda-based communications network enterprise.  

Citizens Communications acquired Global's local exchange properties, including the Frontier brand, in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EED71E38F930A25754C0A9669C8B63 New York Times article]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Global Crossing]] filed for Chapter 11 protection at the beginning of 2002, with its remaining assets being sold to China Netcom's subsidiary Asia Netcom.

Under the Frontier brand, Citizens Communications provides telephone, television and Internet services in 24 states. The company changed its name on July 31, 2008, to [[Frontier Communications|Frontier Communications Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=66508&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1182167&amp;highlight= Company press release]&lt;/ref&gt;
