The '''Iron Bowl''' is an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played annually by the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football]] team of the [[University of Alabama]] and the [[Auburn Tigers football]] team of [[Auburn University]].  The series is considered one of the best and most hard-fought rivalries in all of sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html| title=The 10 greatest rivalries| publisher=ESPN| date=2007-01-03| accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jpehWR53e7AC| title=Football Feuds: The Greatest College Football Rivalries| last=Rappoport| first=Ken| coauthors=Barry Wilner| publisher=Globe Pequot| year=2007| isbn=978-1-59921-014-8| chapter=The Iron Bowl: Auburn-Alabama| page=77 |ref=FootballFeuds}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the rivalry was mainly played in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] for many years, the name of the Iron Bowl comes from Birmingham's historic role in the steel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://collegefootball.about.com/od/rivalries/a/riv-ironbowl.htm| title=Alabama-Auburn Rivalry â The Iron Bowl| publisher=About.com| last=Hyland| first=Tim| accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alabama leads the series with an overall record of 41â34â1.

The games are played at [[JordanâHare Stadium]] in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] every odd-numbered year, and in [[BryantâDenny Stadium]] at [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] every even-numbered year. For much of the 20th century the game was played every year at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. Alabama has a 32â15 record in games played at Legion Field, while Auburn has a 7â4 record in games played at JordanâHare Stadium and a 7â1 record in games played in Tuscaloosa (5â1 at BryantâDenny Stadium). The game is traditionally played on [[Thanksgiving Day]] weekend. In 1993 both schools agreed to move the game up to the week before Thanksgiving to give themselves a bye for a potential [[SEC Championship Game]] berth, however in 2007 the conference voted to ban any team from having a bye in its schedule before the league championship game, returning the game to its traditional Thanksgiving weekend spot.

==History==
Auburn and Alabama played their first football game in Lakeview Park in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on February 22, 1893. Auburn (then named the [[Auburn University|Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama]]) won 32â22, before an estimated crowd of 5,000. As if a signal of the future, disagreement between the schools began immediately as Alabama considered the game to be the final matchup of the 1892 season and Auburn recorded it as the first of 1893.

Tensions further built when, after both 1906 and 1907 contests, Auburn head coach [[Mike Donahue]] threatened to cancel the series if Alabama head coach [[J. W. H. Pollard|&quot;Doc&quot; Pollard]] continued employing his elaborate formations and shifts.&lt;ref&gt;Groom, 2000, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The series was indeed suspended after the 1907 game when the schools could not come to agreement over the amount of expenses to be paid players, as well as from where officials for the game should be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 79&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 the Alabama House of Representatives passed a resolution encouraging the schools to &quot;make possible the inauguration of a full athletic program between the two schools&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.coloradotigers.com/concourse/traditions_ironbowl.htm | title=The Auburn-Alabama Rivalry, &quot;The Iron Bowl&quot; | publisher=Rocky Mountain Auburn Club | accessdate=2006-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools were disinclined to resume the series despite the passage of the resolution, since it did not have the effect of law.  However, the Alabama congress threatened to withhold state funding from the schools unless they DID resume the rivalry.  With that threat in mind, Ralph B. Draughon, the president of Auburn (then named the [[Auburn University|Alabama Polytechnic Institute]]), and Alabama president John Gallalee decided during the winter and spring of 1948 to end the disagreement and renew the series. The games would be played in Birmingham because it had the largest stadium in the state, 44,000-seat [[Legion Field]], and the tickets would be split evenly between the two schools. Alabama won the first game when the series renewed 55â0, the most lopsided victory of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.1122productions.com/brandon/ftbstats/2000/week10-2000.html| title=The University of Alabama Football Facts| year=2000| accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rolltide.com/archive_files/files/football/2007/mediaguide/176-181.pdf| title=This is Alabama Football: Iron Bowl| publisher=University of Alabama Athletics| page=157| accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980 the series had come to be called the Iron Bowl, due to [[Birmingham]]'s prominence as a center of [[iron]] and [[steel]] production. Throughout the 1980s, Auburn made additions to [[JordanâHare Stadium]], and in 1987 it eclipsed [[Legion Field]] in size. Auburn desired to make the Iron Bowl a &quot;home-and-home&quot; series, and the schools reached an agreement where Auburn could play their home games for the Iron Bowl in Auburn starting in 1989 (except for the 1991 game, which was played at [[Legion Field]]), and Alabama would have a &quot;home&quot; ticket allocation for games in [[Legion Field]]. On December 2, 1989, Alabama came to Auburn's [[JordanâHare Stadium]] for the first time in the history of the rivalry. A sellout crowd would witness Auburn win its first true &quot;home&quot; game of the series, 30â20 over an Alabama team that entered the game unbeaten and ranked #2 in the country.

Alabama continued to hold their home game at Legion Field. In 1998, Alabama expanded [[BryantâDenny Stadium]] to a capacity of 83,818, exceeding Legion Field by a few hundred. Alabama moved their home games in the series to Bryant-Denny Stadium in 2000. A new attendance record for the Iron Bowl was set in 2006 as the latest expansion to BryantâDenny Stadium increased its capacity to 92,138. The record was reset again in 2010, after another expansion to Alabama's BryantâDenny Stadium, when a crowd of 101,821 witnessed an Auburn victory with a score of 28â27.

In 2009 and 2010 [[CBS Sports]] arranged an agreement between the two universities to have the game played in an exclusive time slot on the Friday following Thanksgiving. The 2009 game was the sixth Iron Bowl to be played on a Friday and the first in 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://msn.foxsports.com/cbk/story/9455280/Iron-Bowl-moves-to-Friday-Rivalry-game-falls-on-day-after-Thanksgiving-| title=Iron Bowl moves to Friday Rivalry game falls on day after Thanksgiving | publisher=Fox Sports| accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS did not attempt to renew the agreement after 2010 due to criticism from within the state from both fan bases, returning the game to its traditional Saturday date.

==Foy-ODK Sportsmanship Award==
The [[trophy]] given to the winner of the game is the [[Foy-ODK Sportsmanship Award]]. It is named after James E. Foy, an Alabama graduate and former Auburn dean of students and [[Omicron Delta Kappa]] Honor Society â which was established on both campuses during the 1920s. The Foy Trophy is presented at halftime of the AuburnâAlabama basketball game later in the same academic year at the winner's coliseum. After the trophy presentation, the SGA President of the losing school must recite his or her adversary's fight song.

'''1967''': '''The Run in the Mud''' â On a night at [[Legion Field]] where thunderstorms caused the game to constantly be stopped to clear raincoats and other wet weather accessories from the field, Alabama quarterback [[Kenny Stabler]] ran for a 47âyard touchdown to give Bama a 7â3 win.&lt;ref&gt;Groom, 2000, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1971''': Both teams were playing for a shot at the national championship against [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] in the Orange Bowl. 10â0 Alabama (#4 [[AP Poll|AP]]) routed 9â0 Auburn (#5 AP), and eventual [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]] winner [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]], 31â7.

'''1972''': '''[[Punt Bama Punt]]''' â Trailing 16â3 with six minutes left, underdog Auburn blocked two Alabama puntsâreturning both for touchdownsâto win the game 17â16, handing Alabama its first loss of the year and ending their national championship hopes.

'''1981''': '''315''' â Alabama coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant]] earned his 315th career victory, passing [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]] to become the all-time winningest Division I-A coach (at the time) in a 28â17 win over Auburn.

'''1982''': '''Bo Over the Top''' â Auburn drove the length of the field and scored with two minutes remaining when running back [[Bo Jackson]] lept over the top of the pile from the one yard line. Auburn won the game 23â22. The victory ended Alabama's 9-game win streak over Auburn, the longest in series history. It would also be coach Bear Bryant's last Iron Bowl.

'''1984''': '''Wrong Way Bo''' â Late in the fourth quarter Auburn had a 4th-and-goal from the one yard line, trailing by two points. Coach [[Pat Dye]] decided to go for the touchdown instead of a field goal. Despite the success two years prior, the ball went to [[Brent Fullwood]] instead of [[Bo Jackson]]. Jackson ran the wrong direction on the block, causing Fullwood to be forced out of bounds by an Alabama defender, Rory Turner, securing a 17â15 victory for Alabama and knocking Auburn out of the [[Sugar Bowl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Iron&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Upsets do happen |url=http://www.al.com/press-register/stories/index.ssf?/base/sports/1227714326169870.xml&amp;coll=3 |newspaper=Press-Register |date=November 26, 2008 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1984Iron2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Dye defends decision to go for TD |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_zMdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m6UEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6795%2C278889 |first=Will |last=Lowry |page=13B |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |date=December 2, 1984 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1985''': '''The Kick''' â At their own 12-yard line and trailing by one point with 37&amp;nbsp;seconds remaining, Alabama quarterback [[Mike Shula]] led the offense down to the Auburn 35&amp;nbsp;yard line. [[Van Tiffin]] hit a 52-yard [[field goal (football)|field goal]] with no time remaining to lift Alabama to a 25â23 victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Iron&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Tiffin â It was like a dream |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZGYeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AskEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=the-kick%20van-tiffin&amp;pg=2058%2C1326234 |first=Mike |last=Goens |newspaper=TimesDaily |page=1B |date=December 2, 1985 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1985Iron2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Crossville native Mike Bobo recalls âThe Kickâ in 1985 |url=http://www.sandmountainreporter.com/news/local/article_269b1436-f81a-11df-ac08-001cc4c002e0.html |first=Lionel |last=Green |newspaper=Sand Mountain Reporter |date=November 24, 2010 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1986''': '''Reverse to Victory''' â Auburn has the ball on the Alabama seven, trailing 17â14 with 32 seconds remaining in the game.  The called play is a [[Reverse (American football)|reverse]] to wide receiver [[Lawyer Tillman]], but Coach Dye did not like the defensive alignment and ran down the sideline and shouted at Tillman to call time out.  (At the time, NCAA rules only allowed players on the field to call time outs.)  The Alabama players saw Dye and assumed a [[Time-out (sport)|time-out]] was to be called, but Tillman does hear his coach and Auburn runs the play.  Against the confused Alabama defense, Tillman took the reverse for a touchdown, and a 21â17 Auburn win.&lt;ref name=&quot;1986Iron&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Chaos spells doom for Alabama |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0DAdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XaUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4354%2C9619014 |first=Billy |last=Mitchell |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |page=A1 |date=November 30, 1986 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1986Iron2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Mobile's Lawyer Tillman hopes his Iron Bowl reverse to victory 25 years ago will never get old |url=http://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/11/mobiles_lawyer_tillman_hopes_h.html |first=Tommy |last=Hicks |newspaper=Press-Register |date=November 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1989''': '''The First Time Ever''' â Auburn (#11 AP) defeated the undefeated Crimson Tide (#2 AP) 30â20 in the first ever Iron Bowl played on campus in Auburn at JordanâHare Stadium. The Auburn victory denied Alabama of the outright SEC Championship and gave the Tigers a share of the title, but Alabama was still awarded a bid to the Sugar Bowl despite the upset.&lt;ref name=&quot;1989Iron&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=AU wins, but Bama gets Sugar |first=Cecil |last=Hurt |coauthor=Tommy Stevenson |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |page=A1 |date=December 2, 1989 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''1993''': '''Radio Championship''' â Unbeaten Auburn (#6 AP) came from behind to defeat 8â1â1 Alabama (#11 AP) in the second Iron Bowl ever played in Auburn, 22â14. The game was not televised due to Auburn's probation, but was shown on [[closed-circuit television]] before 47,421 fans in Tuscaloosa's BryantâDenny Stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;1993Iron1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Day historic in more ways than one |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bkkgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wqUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4490%2C6247770 |first=Tommy |last=Stevenson |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |page=B1 |date=November 21, 1993 |accessdate=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1994''': 10â0 Alabama (#3 AP) defeated 9â0â1 Auburn (#6 AP) 21â14 in a matchup of undefeated teams, ending Auburn's 21âgame unbeaten streak.

'''1996''': In the second-to-last Iron Bowl played at Legion Field, Alabama came from behind to beat Auburn 24â23 in the final minutes of the game. It was also the final Iron Bowl for Alabama coach Gene Stallings, finishing with a respectable career coaching record in the rivalry's history at 5â2.

'''1999''': Alabama gets their first victory in Auburn, 28â17.

'''2000''': The Iron Bowl returned to Tuscaloosa for the first time in 99 years. Amidst miserable weather conditions of cold and sleet, Auburn clinched a spot in the [[2000 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship game]] with a 9â0 shutout led by kicker Damon Duval. It was also the final game for Alabama head coach [[Mike DuBose]].

'''2004''': Alabama came into the game unranked but led Auburn 6-0 during the first half, relying on two field goals kicked by Brian Bostick. The No. 2-ranked Tigers came back strong in the second half, starting with the combination of quarterback [[Jason Campbell]] and running back [[Carnell Williams|Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams]] scoring a touchdown. Auburn scored a total of 21 points during the second half. The Crimson Tide's quarterback Spencer Pennington connected with [[D. J. Hall]] to score a touchdown in the final minutes of the game. Auburn won 21-13, and moved on to win the SEC Championship game.

'''2005''': '''Sacked!''' - In Jordan-Hare Stadium, Auburn sets a new school record by sacking Alabama quarterback Brodie Croyle 11 times.  Auburn records five sacks while holding Alabama to minus-17&amp;nbsp;yards of offense in the first quarter alone. Seven different Auburn players recorded at least half a sack in the game, led by 3.5 sacks from Stanley McClover. Auburn wins 28â18.

'''2007''': '''Six In-a-Row''' â Auburn wins a sixth straight Iron Bowl over Alabama 17-10. This is currently the longest winning streak in the rivalry for Auburn. Brandon Cox becomes only the second starting quarterback for the Tigers, alongside Jason Campbell, to have never lost against the Crimson Tide. 

'''2008''': '''The Beat Down in T-town''' â Alabama ends Auburn's six game win streak in the series with a 36â0 victory in [[Tommy Tuberville]]'s last game as Auburn's head coach. It also marked the first series victory for Alabama in Tuscaloosa in over three decades. 

'''2009''': '''The Drive''' â Trailing 21â20 with 8:27 remaining, unbeaten Alabama (#2 AP) marched down the field on a 15-play, 79&amp;nbsp;yard drive capped by a 3&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown pass from [[Greg McElroy]] to Roy Upchurch. Alabama took the lead 26â21 with 1:27 remaining and held on for the win. Alabama would go on to win both the [[2009 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship]] and the [[2010 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship]].

'''2010''': '''The Camback''' â Facing a 24 point deficit, [[Cam Newton]] rallied #2 Auburn to a 28-27 victory, riding roughshod over over a suddenly pedestrian Alabama defense, thus snapping Alabama's 20-game home win streak.  [[Cam Newton]] went on to win the [[Heisman Trophy]].  Auburn would go on to win both the [[2010 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship]] and the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship]].

'''2011''': '''Never Again''' - Coming into the game ranked #2 in the nation, Alabama sought redemption after the previous year's one-point loss against the Tigers.  Alabama dominated while scoring 42 points, while shutting out the Auburn offense.  Auburn's 14 points come from a fumble recovery near the goaline and a 83-yard kickoff return by Onterio McCalebb.  Alabama's [[Trent Richardson]] ran for a career-high 203 yards in the win to keep his [[Heisman Trophy]] hopes alive.

==Game results==
Since 1893, the Crimson Tide and Tigers have played 76 times. Alabama leads the all-time series, with 41 wins to Auburn's 34, with one tie.  The game has been played in four cities: [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]], [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]. Alabama leads the series in Birmingham (34â18â1). Auburn leads the series in Tuscaloosa (7â1) and Auburn (7â4). The series is tied in Montgomery (2â2). For the first time in history the previous two winners of the Iron Bowl went on to win the [[BCS National Championship]], [[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] in 2009 and [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] in 2010. This also marked the first time that two different teams from the same state won consecutive [[BCS National Championship|BCS National Championship games]].
