<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="32915226" ns="0" title="List of Israeli Ashkenazi Jews"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">{{Israeli people}}
This is a '''list of notable [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Ashkenazi Jews]]''', including both original immigrants who obtained Israeli citizenship and their Israeli descendants.

It should be noted that although traditionally the term &quot;Ashkenazi Jews&quot; was used as an all encompassing term referring to the Jews descended from the Jewish communities of Europe, due to the [[Melting pot#Israel|melting pot affect of the Israeli society]] the term &quot;Ashkenazi Jews&quot; gradually becomes more vague as many of the Israeli descendants of the Ashkenazi Jews immigrants gradually adopted the characteristics of the Israeli culture and as more decedents intermarry with descendants of other Jewish communities.

The list is ordered by category of human endeavor. Persons with significant contributions in two fields are listed in both of the pertinent categories, to facilitate easy lookup.
