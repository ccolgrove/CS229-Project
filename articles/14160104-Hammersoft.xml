The '''2007â08 [[Vanderbilt Commodores men's basketball]] team''' represented [[Vanderbilt University]] in the 2007â08 [[college basketball]] season. The team was led by head coach [[Kevin Stallings]] and played home games at [[Memorial Gymnasium (Vanderbilt University)|Memorial Gymnasium]].

The 2007â08 team finished the season 26â8, and ranked 25th in both the [[AP Poll]] and the [[Coaches Poll|ESPN/USA Today (Coaches) poll]]. Their 16â0 start was the best in school history. The team finished in 3rd place in the SEC Eastern Division with a 10â6 conference record.

During [[NCAA basketball tournament selection process#Selection Sunday|Selection Sunday]], Vanderbilt received a #4 seed in the Midwest Region of the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. They faced #13 seed [[Siena Saints men's basketball|Siena]] in the first round on March 21, 2008. The Commodores were upset at a final score of 83â62,&lt;ref name=&quot;saints&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=284000005|title=Siena 83, No. 19 Vanderbilt 62|date=2008-03-21|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the second #4 seed upset after [[2007-08 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|UConn]]'s overtime loss to [[San Diego Toreros men's basketball|San Diego]].

==Preseason outlook==
Entering the season, Vanderbilt was picked by the media attending the SEC's media days in October to finish 4th in the SEC East, behind [[Tennessee Vols|Tennessee]], [[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] and two-time defending national champion [[Florida Gators|Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=3&amp;url_subchannel_id=&amp;url_article_id=9770&amp;change_well_id=2|title=Media Tabs UT as 2008 SEC Men's Basketball Champs|publisher=SECsports.com|accessdate=2007-11-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanderbilt lost two starters from last year's teamâ2007 SEC-player of the year [[Derrick Byars]] (19.1 ppg) and shooting guard, Dan Cage (11.2 ppg) â and return three startersâswingman [[Shan Foster]], point guard Alex Gordon and power forward Ross Neltner.

Shan Foster was the Commodores' second leading scorer last season (15.6 ppg) and is the third leading returning scorer in the SEC. Foster was selected by the SEC media to the pre-season all-SEC second team. Alex Gordon had only 51 turnovers last season, tops among starting SEC point guards, and his 2.22-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio was fourth best in the SEC. Neltner provided a versatile presence inside, averaging 5.7 rebounds per game, dishing out 74 assists and hitting 11-of-28 attempts from three-point range.

Sophomores Jermaine Beal and George Drake and freshman Keegan Bell are expected to compete for the shooting guard spot vacated by Cage. The Commodores appear set at center, where senior Alan Metcalfe and freshman [[Andrew Ogilvy|Andrew (A.J.) Ogilvy]] will share time. Metcalfe missed part of last season with a foot injury, while Ogilvy comes highly touted after spending four years at the [[Australian Institute of Sport]]. Other newcomers expected to vie for playing time are guard Keegan Bell and forwards Andre Walker and Darshawn McClellan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vucommodores.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/102307aad.html|title=Recent Taste of Success Has Commodores Wanting More|publisher=vucommodores.cstv.com|accessdate=2007-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Shan Foster and A.J. Oglivy both struggling, the Commodores trailed 58â40 after Dar Tucker scored on an alley-opp dunk with 15:15 to go. Vanderbilt seemed to revive, finally tying the score at 79â79 with 22&amp;nbsp;seconds left.

The Commodores achieved their best ever start, bettering a 12â0 start in 2003â04. After trading baskets for much of the first half, the Commodores built a 5-point lead at halftime. Unlike their previous game, the Commodores went on a 26â5 run to start the second half, putting the game out of reach and allowing the walk-on players to get some playing time. Vanderbilt continued to display a lax defense, but more than made up for it by shooting 56% from the floor and 55% from beyond the arc. Vanderbilt had four players in double figures, led by A.J. Ogilvy (who again just missed a double-double with 20 points and 9 rebounds) and Shan Foster (20 points).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=273650238|title=No. 15 Vanderbilt overwhelms Iona for 13th victory|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ogilvy added 14 points and 9 rebounds and Alex Gordon had 11 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280030238|title=Vanderbilt topples Rice, remains undefeated behind Foster's 24|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Game 17'''.

The loss snapped the Commodores' 4-game winning streak against the Wildcats. Vanderbilt entered the game as one of five remaining unbeaten teams in men's Division I basketball. Kentucky controlled most of the game, taking a 16-point lead five minutes into the second half. The Commodores, who never led in regulation, tied the game on a three-pointer by Shan Foster with 14&amp;nbsp;seconds left to force overtime. The teams traded leads in the first overtime, but Vandy needed an A.J. Ogilvy-putback with 1.8&amp;nbsp;seconds left to force a second overtime.

The Vols held the Commodores well below their season scoring average (86.0 ppg) and limited them to 3 three-pointers. Vanderbilt stayed close for about 11&amp;nbsp;minutes, but a 16â3 run gave Tennessee a 33â18 lead with 3:59 left in the first half.
