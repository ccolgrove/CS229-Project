'''Debian GNU/Hurd''' is the [[Debian]] project's distribution of the [[GNU]] [[operating system]], using the [[GNU Hurd]] [[microkernel]]. Its developers are hoping to be able to release Debian GNU/Hurd for the next major release of [[Debian]], &quot;wheezy&quot;.

&lt;/ref&gt; of the software packaged for Debian GNU/Linux has been ported to the GNU Hurd. However, the Hurd itself remains under development, and as such is not ready for use in production systems. The overwhelming majority of Debian users run Debian GNU/Linux, rather than Debian GNU/Hurd. The Debian GNU/Hurd developers are hoping to be able to release it for the next major release of [[Debian]], &quot;wheezy&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/news/2011-q2.html 2011-q2], GNU Hurd news, read 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/ Debian GNU/Hurd] project page, read 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which is planned to be sometime around 2013. 

Debian GNU/Hurd is distributed on a [[live CD]].  The CD uses the [[IA-32]] architecture, making it compatible with [[IA-32]] and [[x86-64]] PCs.

The current version of Debian GNU/Hurd is L1 as of 2011. On February 15th, 2011 the debian-installer based image was updated to squeeze d-i packages. On June 11th, 2011 various bugs of the debian-installer based image were fixed, there is no known issue except that GNOME and KDE are not installable yet.
