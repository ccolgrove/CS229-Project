Like Netscape version 8.x, Navigator 9 is based upon the [[Mozilla Firefox]], this time version 2.0, and should have full support of all Firefox [[add-ons]] and [[plugins]], some of which Netscape is providing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&amp;nav=messages&amp;webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&amp;tid=6558 Netscape 9 - 6 February 2007 announcement] Retrieved on February 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape has also been releasing some of its features as extensions for Firefox, including the [http://blog.netscape.com/2006/12/06/browser-extensions/ Site Mail Notifier and Friends' Activity Sidebar], the [http://blog.netscape.com/2006/12/08/the-netscape-digg-tracker/ Digg Tracker], as well as [http://blog.netscape.com/2007/04/10/netstripe-netscape-9s-theme-for-firefox/ Netstripe], the new default theme for Netscape 9.

Navigator 9 also sees the browser return to multi-platform support across [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&amp;nav=messages&amp;webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&amp;tid=6459 Netscape 9 - 30 Jan 20m07 announcement] Retrieved on January 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape's signature splash screen also reappeared in the release candidate of the final program.

===Other features===
Unlike Netscape 8, the browser does not use  [[Internet Explorer 6]]'s [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident layout engine]] as an alternative engine option, alongside various other additional features.

Netscape Navigator did not include an [[email]] and [[newsgroups]] [[email client|client]] or an [[instant messaging]] client as Netscape 6 and 7 did. Netscape did, however, plan to produce a companion email client to complement the Navigator, confirmed as [[Netscape Messenger 9]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://browser.netscape.com/faq Netscape Navigator FAQ] Retrieved on June 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&amp;nav=messages&amp;webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&amp;tid=8692 Netscape Mercury/Messenger 9 requests at Netscape Community Support] Retrieved on June 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While that software was in production, Netscape advised its users to use the [[Netscape 7]] series of [[Internet suite|suites]], which includes an email client, alongside Navigator 9 for browsing purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Netscape Navigator features&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Netscape9 bookofmozilla.png|thumb|250px|Screenshot of ''The Book of Mozilla'', 8:20 in Netscape 9]]
A new verse 8:20 of the [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] ''[[The Book of Mozilla#The Book of Mozilla, 8:20|The Book of Mozilla]]'' was written for the release of Netscape 9, consisting of ''&quot;And thus the Creator looked upon the beast reborn and saw that it was good&quot;''. This could have reference either to the re-development of Netscape in-house once again, or the [[Mozilla Foundation]] and its contributors.&lt;ref&gt;about:mozilla typed in the address bar of Netscape 9 Beta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
[[Download.com|CNET Download.com]] claims Navigator 9 has some &quot;neat&quot; components, contains many &quot;tricks we love&quot; and is &quot;more than a backup browser&quot;; which they previously used to describe Browser 8. Most of the bundled features from version 8 have been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.download.com/Netscape-Navigator/3000-2356_4-10695623.html?tag=lst-0-5 Download.com review of Netscape Navigator 9] Retrieved on June 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
