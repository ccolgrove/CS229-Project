'''Monoppix''' is a &quot;[[Live CD]]&quot; [[Linux distribution]] (based on [[Knoppix]]), that works without installing anything on your hard drive, running completely off the [[Compact Disc|CD]] and [[Random access memory|RAM]].

The main purpose of this distribution was to showcase and spread [[Mono (software)|Mono]] technology, a free [[.NET Framework]] implementation for Linux and Unix operating systems.

== Contents ==

*Mono - runtime environment, compiler and class libraries
*[[MonoDevelop]] - Mono enabled IDE
*[[XSP (software)|XSP]] - ASP.NET web server
*[[Gtk Sharp|Gtk#]] - for desktop applications (sample included)
*[[MySQL]] - database server
*Quickstarts and Mono walkthroughs and tutorials

== Status ==
As of April 2009, Monoppix had not been updated since August 2005, and has apparently been discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=monoppix&lt;/ref&gt;
