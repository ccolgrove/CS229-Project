==Biography==
===Background===
Born in [[El Toro, California]] to Alice and Jeff Krause, he is the younger of their two children. His older brother is named Patrick. Brian grew up in Southern California and took his first acting class with [[R. J. Adams]] at [[The Actors Workshop]] while in junior high as a way to avoid a bully in physical education class. In his teens, he studied karate, and attended [[El Toro High School]], graduating in 1987. He continued his education at [[Orange Coast College]] where he played and lettered in soccer, scoring four goals as a midfielder and forward.

===Career===
Krause landed his first role in 1989 as a student in the TV series ''[[TV 101]]''. He then starred in the made-for-TV-movie ''Match Point'', the [[CBS Schoolbreak Special]] &quot;American Eyes&quot;, and ''An American Summer'', before landing his first major role as Richard Lestrange in ''[[Return to the Blue Lagoon]]''. He was a co-star in the ''Bandit'' series prior to his most notable role of Leo in the WB Network series ''[[Charmed]]'' (1998â2006). Brian originally auditioned for the role of Andy Trudeau, but was cast as Piper's handyman love interest, [[Leo Wyatt]]. Due to budget restrictions in the 8th season, he only appeared in the first 10 episodes, and in the last 2 episodes. After ''Charmed'', he has appeared in made-for-TV-movies and TV shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]'' and ''[[The Closer]]''. Currently, he is portraying a minor character in the videogame [[L.A. Noire]], lending his voice and image to it.
