'''MINIX''' is a [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]] based on a [[microkernel]] [[Software architecture|architecture]] created by [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]] for educational purposes; MINIX also inspired the creation of the [[Linux kernel]].  

MINIX (from &quot;mini-Unix&quot;) was first released in 1987, with its complete source code made available to universities for study in courses and research. It has been [[free and open source software]] since it was re-licensed under the [[BSD license]] in April 2000.

==Implementation==
===MINIX 1.0===
[[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]] created MINIX at [[Vrije Universiteit]] in [[Amsterdam]] to exemplify the principles conveyed in his [[textbook]], ''[[Operating Systems: Design and Implementation]]'' (1987).

An abridged 12,000 lines of the [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] of the [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]], [[memory manager]], and [[file system]] of MINIX 1.0 are printed in the book. [[Prentice-Hall]] also released MINIX source code and binaries on [[floppy disk]] with a reference manual. MINIX 1 was system-call compatible with [[Seventh Edition Unix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minix1.woodhull.com/osdi2/|title=Operating Systems Design and Implementation|isbn=0-13-638677-6|date=1997|accessdate=August 2, 2011|coauthors=Andrew S. Tanenbaum;Albert S. Woodhull}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tanenbaum originally developed MINIX for compatibility with the [[IBM PC]] and [[IBM PC/AT]] [[microcomputer]]s available at the time.

===MINIX 1.5===
MINIX 1.5, released in 1991, included support for [[MicroChannel]] [[IBM PS/2]] systems and was also [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Motorola 68000]] and [[SPARC]] architectures, supporting the [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARCstation]] [[Platform (computing)|computer platforms]].  There were also unofficial ports to [[Intel 386]] [[PC compatible]]s (in [[32-bit]] [[protected mode]]), [[National Semiconductor]] [[NS320xx|NS32532]], [[Advanced RISC Machine|ARM]] and [[INMOS]] [[transputer]] processors. [[Meiko Scientific]] used an early version of MINIX as the basis for the [[MeikOS]] operating system for its transputer-based [[Computing Surface]] [[parallel computer]]s. A version of MINIX running as a user process under [[SunOS]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] was also available, a simulator called [[SMX (operating system)|SMX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minix3.org/previous-versions/CD-ROM-2.0/README.TXT|title=WELCOME TO MINIX|format=TXT|date=July 22, 2005|accessdate=August 2, 2011|coauthors=Andrew S. Tanenbaum;Albert S. Woodhull;Kees Bot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy345/assignments/99b/smx_howto.html|title=Installing and running MINIX for Solaris (SMX)|date=|accessdate=August 2, 2011|author=M. Flouris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MINIX 2.0===
Demand for the 68k-based architectures waned, however, and MINIX 2.0, released in 1997, was only available for the [[x86]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]-hosted SPARC architectures.  It was the subject of the second edition of Tanenbaum's textbook, co-written with Albert Woodhull and was distributed on a [[CD-ROM]] included with the book. MINIX 2.0 added [[POSIX]].1 compliance, support for 386 and later processors in 32-bit mode and replaced the [[Amoeba distributed operating system|Amoeba]] network protocols included in MINIX 1.5 with a [[TCP/IP]] stack. Unofficial ports of MINIX 2.0.2 to the 68020-based ISICAD Prisma 700 workstation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.dial.pipex.com/town/way/fr30/minix/|title=Minix on the Prisma|date=|accessdate=August 2, 2011|author=George Harvey}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[SuperH|Hitachi SH3]]-based HP [[Jornada (PDA)|Jornada]] 680/690 [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minixsh.tripod.co.jp/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021211135921/http://minixsh.tripod.co.jp/index.html|archivedate=December 11, 2002|title=MINIX for Jornada|date=Sep. 23, 2002|accessdate=August 2, 2011|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also developed.

====Minix-vmd====
{{main|Minix-vmd}}

[[Minix-vmd]] is a variant of MINIX 2 for Intel [[IA-32]]-compatible processors, created by two Vrije Universiteit researchers, which adds [[virtual memory]] and support for the [[X Window System]].

===MINIX 3===
{{Main|MINIX 3}}

MINIX 3 was publicly announced on 24 October 2005 by Andrew Tanenbaum during his keynote speech on top of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Symposium Operating Systems Principles conference. Although it still serves as an example for the new edition of Tanenbaum and Woodhull's textbook, it is comprehensively redesigned to be &quot;usable as a serious system on resource-limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability.&quot; 

MINIX 3 currently supports only [[IA-32]] architecture PC compatible systems. It is available in a [[Live CD]] format that allows it to be used on a computer without installing it on the hard drive, and in versions compatible with hardware emulation/virtualization systems, including [[Bochs]], [[QEMU]], [[VMware Workstation]]/[[VMware Fusion|Fusion]], [[VirtualBox]] and [[Microsoft Virtual PC]].

Version 3.1.5 was released 5 November 2009. It contains [[X11]], [[emacs]], [[vi]], cc, [[GNU Compiler Collection|gcc]], [[perl]], [[Python (programming language)|python]], [[Almquist shell|ash]], [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[zsh]], [[ftp]], [[Secure Shell|ssh]], [[telnet]], [[Pine (e-mail client)|pine]], and over 400 other common [[Unix]] utility programs. With the addition of X11, this version marks the transition away from a text-only system. It can also withstand driver crashes. In many cases it can automatically replace drivers without affecting running processes. This feature will be improved in future releases. In this way, MINIX is self-healing and can be used in applications demanding high reliability. MINIX 3 also has support for [[virtual memory]] management, making it suitable for desktop OS use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/minix3/msg/86c914a0c13376fe|title=New to minix|date=November 10, 2010|accessdate=August 2, 2011|author=Ulrich Schmidt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desktop applications such as [[Firefox]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] are not yet available for MINIX 3 however.

With the creation of MINIX 3, and its transition to a graphical interface, some commercial software and hardware developers have started to implement some systems with MINIX in the late 2000s.{{cn|date=March 2011}}

==MINIX and Linux==
The design principles Tanenbaum applied to MINIX greatly influenced the design decisions [[Linus Torvalds]] applied in the creation of the [[Linux kernel]]. Torvalds used and appreciated MINIX, however, his design deviated from the MINIX architecture in significant ways, most notably by employing a [[monolithic kernel]] instead of a [[microkernel]]. This was famously disapproved of by Tanenbaum in the [[TanenbaumâTorvalds debate]]. Tanenbaum explained again his rationale for using a microkernel in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/reliable-os|title=Tanenbaum-Torvalds Debate: Part II|date=May 12, 2006|accessdate=August 2, 2011|author=Andrew S. Tanenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Early Linux kernel development was done on a MINIX host system, which led to Linux inheriting various features from MINIX, such as the [[MINIX file system]].

In May 2004, [[Kenneth Brown (author)|Kenneth Brown]] of the [[Alexis de Tocqueville Institution]] made the accusation that major parts of the Linux kernel had been copied from the MINIX codebase, in a book called ''[[Samizdat (book)|Samizdat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adti.net/samizdat/brown.reply.june.04.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090303090226/http://adti.net/samizdat/brown.reply.june.04.html|archivedate=March 3, 2009|title=Samizdat's critics... Brown replies|date=June 4, 2004|accessdate=August 2, 2011|publisher=Alexis de Tocqueville Institution|author=Kenneth Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accusations were rebutted universallyâmost prominently by Andrew Tanenbaum himself, who strongly criticised Kenneth Brown and published a long rebuttal on his own personal website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ast/brown/|title=Some Notes on the &quot;Who wrote Linux&quot; Kerfuffle|date=May 20, 2004|accessdate=August 2, 2011|author=Andrew S. Tanenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MINIX3.org/doc/faq.html#Legal_Questions|title=MINIX 3 FAQ|date=May 10, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2011|author=Andrew S. Tanenbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensing==
At the time of its original development, the [[software license|license]] for MINIX was considered to be rather liberal. Its licensing fee was very small ($69) compared to those of other operating systems.  Although Tanenbaum wished for MINIX to be as accessible as possible to [[student]]s, his publisher was not prepared to offer material (such as the source code) that could be copied freely, so a restrictive license requiring a nominal fee (included in the price of Tanenbaum's book) was applied as a compromise.  This prevented the use of MINIX as the basis for a freely distributed software system.

When [[free and open source software|free and open source]] Unix-like operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[386BSD]] became available in the early 1990s many [[volunteer]] [[software developer]]s abandoned MINIX in favor of these. In April 2000, MINIX became free/open source software under a [[permissive free software license]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minix3.org/license.html|title=The Minix licence}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by this time other operating systems had surpassed its capabilities, and it remained primarily an operating system for students and [[hobbyist]]s.
