'''Rawhide''' is the [[branching (software)#Development branch|development tree]] for the [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] [[Linux]] [[Linux distribution|distribution]]. It is continually revised, with [[software]] being added, removed, and updated. In many cases, this software is made of [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]] or [[Git (software)|Git]] snapshots. 

Rawhide is not meant to be used as a production system. It should only be used as a development testbed. However, many developers and hackers from the [[Fedora Project]] use it as their primary [[operating system]].
