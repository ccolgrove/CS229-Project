}}The '''2010 FedEx Orange Bowl''' game featured the [[2009 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] and the [[2009 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa Hawkeyes]] on Tuesday, January 5, 2010, at [[Land Shark Stadium]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]], [[Florida]].  Iowa won the game 24â14, securing the Hawkeyes' first major bowl win since the 1959 Rose Bowl.

Georgia Tech was selected to participate in the Orange Bowl after a 11â2 season that culminated in a 39â34 victory in the [[2009 ACC Championship Game]]. Iowa was selected as the other half of the matchup after a 10â2 season that ended with a 12â0 win against [[2009 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]]. In the weeks between the teams' selection and the playing of the game, media attention focused on Georgia Tech's proficient offense and Iowa's highly rated defense.

The game was part of the 2009â2010 [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) of the [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season]] and the last game of the season for both teams.  It was the coldest Orange Bowl in Miami's history with a kick-off temperature of 49 degrees. 

The game was televised in the United States on [[Fox Sports (USA)|FOX]], and marked the end of the broadcast agreement between the BCS and FOX, as [[ESPN]] took over all BCS broadcast rights in 2011.  This was Iowa's second Orange Bowl appearance (first appearance in [[2003 Orange Bowl]]), and Georgia Tech's sixth appearance, but first since 1967.  It was the first time that the two teams had played against each other.

On July 14, 2011, the [[NCAA]] vacated Georgia Tech's appearance in the bowl game as a consequence for major violations committed by the football program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/6769894/ncaa-places-georgia-tech-yellow-jackets-four-years-probation NCAA places Georgia Tech on probation], ESPN, July 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Team selection==
The [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] is one of five [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) [[bowl game]]s that have been played at the conclusion of every college football season since 2006.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Between 1998 and 2006, there were four BCS games.&lt;/ref&gt; As defined by contract, the bowl matches the champion of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) against an at-large pick chosen by a special committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/25/AR2006072501258.html | accessdate = December 16, 2007 | work=The Washington Post | title=ACC, Orange Bowl Make a Deal | date=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 5, 2009, the [[2009 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] defeated the [[2009 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson Tigers]] in the [[2009 ACC Championship Game]], thus winning an automatic bid to the 2010 Orange Bowl Game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcsknowhow.com/georgia-tech-clinches-orange-bowl-bid&lt;/ref&gt;

The at-large spot in the Orange Bowl was filled via a [[round-robin]] selection procedure defined by the other Bowl Championship series games (the [[Sugar Bowl|Sugar]], [[Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta]], and [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose]] bowls) and the automatic bids.&lt;ref name=&quot;BCS selection&quot;&gt;The Bowl Championship Series. [http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/eligibility &quot;BCS Selection Procedures&quot;], BCSfootball.org. November 26, 2008. Accessed December 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The order of at-large selections rotates annually among the BCS bowls. In 2010, after the bowls who lost host teams to the [[2010 BCS National Championship Game]] chose their replacements, the Orange Bowl picked first, followed by the Fiesta Bowl, then the Sugar Bowl.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/bowls/predictions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burntorangenation.com/2008/12/7/683942/bcs-selection-process-expl &quot;BCS Selection Process Explained&quot;], burntorangenation.com. December 7, 2008. Accessed December 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Having lost their SEC tie-in ([[2009 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]]) to the national title game, the [[2010 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] chose the [[2009 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] as the replacement.  Likewise, the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] picked the [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|Texas Christian Horned Frogs]] to replace the Big-12 champion [[2010 Texas Longhorns football team|2010 Texas Longhorns]].  The Orange Bowl then selected the [[2009 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa Hawkeyes]], while the Fiesta Bowl picked the [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State Broncos]] to set up a battle of the unbeatens.  The Sugar Bowl was thus left to select [[Big East Conference]] champion [[2009 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati Bearcats]], fulfilling the BCS' contractual obligation to provide a game for the conference's champion.

===Iowa===
{{main|2009 Iowa Hawkeyes football team}}

The Hawkeyes entered the 2009 season after a 9-4 overall 2008 record that included a 31-10 win in the [[2009 Outback Bowl]] over South Carolina.  Iowa's first game over Northern Iowa would be a sign of things to come in the season.  With just 7 seconds left in the game, Northern Iowa attempted a 40 yard field goal that would be blocked.  Iowa avoided touching the ball thinking the ball had crossed the line of scrimmage, while in fact it did not.  Northern Iowa's recovery allowed for another attempt with 1 second left.  But once again, the attempt would be blocked, giving Iowa a 17-16 victory.

Iowa would win their next 7 games, including a 21-10 win over top-five ranked [[2009 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], a last minute stop to beat [[2009 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and a last second touchdown to get a win over [[2009 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]].

On November 7, Iowa appeared to be headed for a 10-0 record when they took an early 10-0 lead against the [[2009 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern Wildcats]].  However, early in the second quarter, quarterback [[Ricky Stanzi]] was knocked out of the game with an ankle injury, in a play that resulted in the Wildcats' first touchdown.  Iowa would not score again in the game, and would lose 17-10.  The Hawkeye's following game, vs. [[2009 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], would determine which team would earn a berth to the Rose Bowl.  Down 24-10 with 11:11 left, Iowa would stage a comeback to force overtime.  But redshirt [[freshman]] quarterback [[James Vandenberg]], filling in for the injured Stanzi, would throw an interception in first overtime series.  Ohio State would take advantage and seal a 27-24 victory with a 39 yard field goal.  Iowa would end the season strong with a 12-0 shutout over the [[Minnesota Gophers]]. Iowa stayed at the Fountaine Bleu in Miami, before the Orange Bowl.

===Georgia Tech===
{{main|2009 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team}}

The Georgia Tech ended the [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008 college football season]] with a 9-4 record under first year head coach [[Paul Johnson (American football coach)|Paul Johnson]], including a share of the ACC Coastal Crown, a win over [[Florida State]], rival [[Georgia Bulldogs]] and a 38-3 loss in the [[2008 Chick-fil-A Bowl]].

The Yellow Jackets opened the [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009 college football season]] with a 37-17 win over {{cfb link|year=2009|team=Jacksonville State Gamecocks|title=Jacksonville State}}.  Georgia Tech's second game against the [[2009 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson Tigers]] saw the Yellow Jackets build up a 24-0 lead, only to see Clemson crawl back to take a 27-24 lead in the fourth quarter.  GT would survive, winning 30-27 on a last minute field goal.  In Tech's first road game of the year, the Yellow Jackets would leave [[Land Shark Stadium]] with a 17-33 loss to the [[2009 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami Hurricanes]].

Following the loss, Georgia Tech would win 8 straight games, including a win over #4 [[2009 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]].  The win would be GT's first home win over a top-five team since 1962.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=292900059&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Tech's final game of the regular season, the [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate]] rivalry game vs [[2009 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], GT would lose its second game of the season.  Down 6 with less than two minutes remaining, the Yellow Jackets gave up their run offense and had four consecutive incomplete &quot;Hail Mary&quot; passes. On 4th and 10 at Georgia's 46 yard line, quarterback Josh Nesbitt's pass to a wide open [[Demaryius Thomas]] was dropped, sealing a 30-24 win for the Bulldogs.

In a week 2 rematch, GT faced Clemson in the [[2009 ACC Championship Game]].  In an exciting, high scoring game that saw no punts, the Yellow Jackets barely eked out a 39-34 victory to earn their first BCS berth.

==Pregame buildup==
===Iowa offense===
Iowa entered the Orange bowl ranked 83rd (of 120 [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] teams) in [[total offense]].&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/college-football/statistics/team/_/stat/total/sort/netTotalYards/count/81&lt;/ref&gt;  The team was ranked 42nd in passing offense and 95th in rushing offense.

===Georgia Tech offense===
At the conclusion of the regular season before the Orange Bowl, Georgia Tech's offense was among the best in Division I, ranked 10th in total offense, 2nd in rushing offense, but only 116th in passing offense (out of 120 teams).  The triple option was able to rack up an average of 306.23 rushing yards per game before the Orange Bowl.

===Iowa defense===
Iowa's defense was considered among the best in Division I, ranking 10th in total defense.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncaa.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/ncaa-m-footbl-fbs-team-total-defense.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hawkeyes ranked 34th in rushing defense and 4th in passing defense.

===Georgia Tech defense===
The Yellow Jackets were ranked 54th in total defense, 68th in rushing defense, and 45th in passing defense.

==Game summary==
===First Quarter===
The first drive of the coldest Orange Bowl ever started with an Iowa fumble at its own 47 yard line.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn.go.com&quot;&gt;http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=300050059&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite having good starting field position, Georgia Tech was forced to punt.  On Iowa's second drive of the game, quarterback [[Ricky Stanzi]] drove 80 yards, culminating in a 3 yard touchdown pass to [[Marvin McNutt]].  The Yellow Jackets' second drive ended in another punt.  Iowa scored another touchdown on the following drive, with Stanzi hitting Colin Sandeman for 21 yards, giving the Hawkeyes a 14-0 lead.  On the ensuing drive, GT punted for the third time in a row.  On Iowa's next drive, Stanzi was intercepted by [[Jerrad Tarrant]].  Tarrant returned the interception for a touchdown, cutting Iowa's lead in half.

===Second Quarter===
The second quarter started with 6 straight punts.  With less than one minute left in the half, Iowa faced a 4th and 5 on Georgia Tech's 43.  But Stanzi's pass fell incomplete to Marvin McNutt.  With only 12 seconds left, GT quarterback [[Josh Nesbitt]] was sacked, ending the quarter.

===Third Quarter===
Georgia Tech started the third quarter off with the ball.  Their first drive ended in a 41-yard field goal attempt that was missed by kicker [[Scott Blair]].  On the next drive, Iowa's [[Daniel Murray]] connected on a 33-yard field goal to give Iowa a 17-7 lead.

===Fourth Quarter===
On the first drive of the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech's Anthony Allen rushed for a 1 yard touchdown to cut Iowa's lead to 17-14.  Iowa was forced to punt on its following drive.  On the first play of the next drive, Nesbitt was intercepted, giving Iowa great field position at Georgia Tech's 15.  On a 4th and goal on the 3 yard line, Iowa attempted a fake field goal.  Kicker Murray fumbled the ball on the attempt giving GT possession.  On the first play of the next drive, while trying to evade defenders, [[Jonathan Dwyer]] ended up in his own endzone.  He narrowly avoided a safety by dodging tacklers and reaching the 1 yard line.  But the 11 yard loss hurt the Yellow Jackets and they were once again forced to punt.  Iowa's next drive ended with a Brandon Wegher 32 yard touchdown rush, giving the Hawkeyes a 24-14 lead.  Down 10, with less than 2 minutes left, Georgia Tech was forced to go for it on a 4th and 8 on their own 32.  Nesbitt's pass to Demaryius Thomas fell incomplete, allowing Iowa to run out the clock. A final sack of Nesbitt by Iowa [[Defensive End]] [[Adrian Clayborn]] helped to seal the deal for the Hawkeyes, giving them their first major bowl victory in 51 years.

==Awards==

Iowa's win gave them the 2010 Orange Bowl trophy, and Iowa Defensive End Adrian Clayborn was named the MVP. Clayborn and Stanzi, during the press conference at the end of the game, both announced their intention to return to Iowa for their senior years.
