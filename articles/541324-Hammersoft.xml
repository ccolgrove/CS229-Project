}}'''Bethune-Cookman University''' or '''B-CU''' is a private [[historically black university]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]].

== History ==
[[Mary McLeod Bethune]] founded the Daytona Educational and Industrial Training School in 1904.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collier-Thomas|first=Bettye|title=The Impact of Black Women in Education: An Historical Perspective|journal=[[The Journal of Negro Education]]|year=1982|month=Summer|volume=51|issue=3|jstor=2294687|page=179|publisher=[[Howard University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The school underwent several stages of growth and development through the years and in 1923, it merged with the Cookman Institute of Jacksonville, Florida and became a co-ed high school. A year later in 1924, it became affiliated with the Methodist Church. By 1931, the school had become a junior college.

The school became a four-year college in 1941 when the [[Florida Board of Education]] approved a 4-year baccalaureate program in Liberal Arts and Teacher Education. The name was changed to Bethune-Cookman College.

On February 14, 2007, the Board of Trustees approved the name Bethune-Cookman University after the institution established its first graduate program.

In October 2010 the [[American Association of University Professors]] accused the university administration of improperly dismissing tenured members of the facultyâsome for alleged sexual harassment (but, in the opinion of the AAUP, without due process), others for &quot;budgetary reasons&quot; but without a declaration of &quot;financial exigency&quot;.  The university responded saying that the AAUP report contained errors and a one-sided view.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schmidt, [http://chronicle.com/article/AAUP-Accuses-Bethune-Cookman/125088/ &quot;AAUP Accuses Bethune-Cookman U. of Denying Due Process to 7 Dismissed Professors&quot;], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', 25 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presidents ===
Bethune retired in 1942 at which time [[James A. Colston]] became president until 1946 when Bethune resumed the presidency for a year.

Richard V. Moore, Sr. became president in 1947. Under his tenure the college was accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1970, joined the [[United Negro College Fund]] and other academic and professional organizations. The curriculum expanded, student enrollment increased and new buildings were constructed for residential housing and classrooms.

Oswald P. Bronson, Sr.(B-CU alumnus) served as the fourth president of the college from 1975 to 2004. During his tenure increased student enrollment led to continuous development and expansion of the college. A rapidly increasing student enrollment led to construction of more student housing, classroom buildings and the Mary Mcleod Bethune Auditorium. Major fields of study increased from 12 in 1974 to 37 by 2003. In addition, seven continuing education centers for students began operating throughout the state. While maintaining accreditation by SACS, Florida Board of Education, and the United Methodist Church Board of Higher Education the college added new accreditations in the Nursing and the Teacher Education programs.

Trudie Kibbe Reed was appointed to the presidency in August 2004 by the Board of Trustees. Reed is the first woman to serve in this capacity since Bethune. Since beginning her tenure, the university has a number of campus improvements including construction of the Center for Civic Engagement, the L. Gale Lemerand School of Nursing, the creation of the Alexis Pugh and Eugene Zimmerman Scholarship houses, and the provision of a university-owned house as an alumni center. Reed also established the university's first graduate program under the School of Graduate &amp; Professional Studies. The new program is a Master of Science in Transformative Leadership.

== Academics ==
Bethune-Cookman University is a small, private, co-educational, and residential institution. The university meets its commitment to excellence through expanding and modifying academic programs and innovative curricular offerings by preparing students to meet the demands of the future. 

The academic program of the university is conducted within seven schools&lt;ref&gt;2008 - 2009 College Catalog&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bbband.jpg|thumb||left|The Marching Wildcats (The Pride)of Bethune-Cookman create the &quot;BCU&quot; formation while playing before a packed Citrus Bowl Stadium at the [[Florida Classic]].]]The Marching Wildcats are a 325 member unit that includes instrumentalists, the Sophisticat Flag Corps and the 14 Karat Gold dancers. Known as &quot;''The Pride'',&quot; the band is under the direction of a Bethune-Cookman alumnus and former Marching Wildcat, Donovan Wells.

The 14 Karat Gold dancers are featured performers in all engagements of the Marching Wildcats and occasionally perform as a solo act. The 14 Karat Gold dancers can be seen frequently in BET video clips promoting Black colleges. The Sophisticat Flag Corps blends traditional flag techniques with innovative choreography to create highly entertaining presentation.
