<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="3913007" ns="0" title="History of Rangers F.C."><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''[[Rangers F.C.]]''' has a long and illustrious history. Formed in 1872, the club are the first, and only, club in the world to have won more than 50 national league titles. The club is also the most honoured in the world having won 115 trophies in total. Despite being formed 137 years ago Rangers have only ever been managed by twelve different men.

This article tells the story of the club from its beginnings to the [[UEFA Cup Winner's Cup|European Cup Winners Cup]] success, the [[Ibrox disaster]]s and the Nine in a Row league championship wins. The history is divided into sections regarding the manager of the club rather than sections of major events. There are some overlaps between managers tenures, namely the Nine in a Row success which began with [[Graeme Souness]] and continued under [[Walter Smith]].

==Formation and early years==
[[Image:Flesher's Haugh.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Modern day picture of Flesher's Haugh]]
In 1872, the club was formed by a group of rowing enthusiasts, [[Peter Campbell (footballer)|Peter Campbell]], [[William McBeath]] and brothers, [[Peter McNeil|Peter]] and [[Moses McNeil]] saw a group of men playing football on [[Glasgow Green]]'s '''Flesher's Haugh'''.

Indeed the team's first game was at Flesher's Haugh in May 1872 against [[Callander F.C.|Callander]], which resulted in a 0â0 draw. Moses McNeil suggested the name Rangers after seeing the name in a book about English [[Rugby football|Rugby]]. Rangers only played two matches in their birth year and their second match, with the team donned in light blue shirts, was a comprehensive 11â0 win over a team named Clyde (not the present [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]]).

Rangers began to grow into a more formal football club and in 1876, for the first time, a player was called up to play international football as Moses McNeil made his Scotland debut against [[Wales national football team|Wales]].

In 1888 the now famous [[Old Firm]] fixture was born as Rangers met Celtic for the first time in a friendly match. [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] beat Rangers 5â2 with a team composed largely of &quot;guest players&quot; from [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]].

The [[1890â91 in Scottish football|1890â91 season]] saw the inception of the [[Scottish Football League]], and Rangers were one of ten original members. By this time Rangers were playing at the first [[Ibrox Stadium]]. Rangers' first ever league match took place on 16 August 1890 and resulted in a 5â2 victory over [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]]. After finishing equal-top with [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] a play-off was held at [[Cathkin Park]] to decide the who would be champions. The match finished 2â2 and the title was shared for the only time in its history, the first of Rangers' world record 54 championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early years&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rangers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/clubhistory/0,,5~1570943,00.html|title=1872â1898 â The Birth Of The Blues|publisher=Rangers F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rangers had to wait until 1894 to taste their first [[Scottish Cup]] success after losing to [[Vale of Leven F.C.|Vale of Leven]] in 1877 and 1879 but finally lifted the trophy for the first time after a 3â1 win over Celtic. Rangers even came close to winning the [[FA Cup|English FA Cup]] in 1887 when they lost to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the semi-final.

Rangers ended the nineteenth century with further Scottish Cup wins 1897 and 1898 and a League Championship win in 1899 during which they won every one of their 18 league matches. Rangers formally became a limited company on 27 May 1899 and the then match secretary [[William Wilton]] was appointed as the clubs first manager. This also enabled Ibrox stadium to be constructed that same year. The club also appointed its first board of directors under the chairmanship of James Henderson. By the turn of the century Rangers had won two league titles and three Scottish Cups and were well on their way to becoming one of Scotland's top clubs.

==The Wilton years==
[[File:Disaster-ibroxi6.jpg|left|thumb|First [[Ibrox disaster]]]]
Rangers were in the ascendancy at the turn of the century, winning the championship seven times between 1900 and 1918 (with four League title in a row). The season of 1898â99 was particularly memorable, in that it saw the Gers win all 18 league games to establish a perfect record.

But between 1902 and 1910, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] took over as the dominant force, and though Rangers had the chance to foil a third League and Cup double in 1909, the [[Scottish FA]] withheld the Cup due to disgraceful scenes after a pitch invasion by drunken fans. The '''Hampden Riot''' had written itself a sorry page in the history books, and both clubs were ordered to compensate hosts Queen's Park for the damage caused by their so â called fans.

Having lost the title in 1919 they responded in 1920 with one of the best seasons in their history as manager [[William Wilton]] and his right hand man [[Bill Struth]] retained the title netting 106 goals in 42 league games. However, in May 1920 the clubs first ever manager, William Wilton, died in a boating accident and Bill Struth was subsequently appointed manager.

==Struth's era==
The key statistic of the 1930s was three consecutive Scottish Cup wins from 1934, 1935, 1936. History was there to be made in 1937 when they set out on the trail of a fourth win, only to lose in the First round to lowly [[Queen of the South]]. Ironically, this was the first Rangers game ever to be immortalised on film.

The post-war seasons saw Rangers well on top, but not before a boardroom coup in the summer of 1947. The board of Rangers had previously been an amateur body made up of former players, but when chairman [[James Bowie (footballer)|James Bowie]] suggested a 71-year-old Struth retire in order to allow a younger man to take charge, a revolution occurred. Bowie was forced out the chair and was said never to have set foot in [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] ever again such was his disdain for the circumstances of his departure.

Struth went on to steer Rangers to 18 league championships, 10 Scottish Cups and 2 [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]]s in his 34 year tenure as manager. He was also the first Rangers manager to win the domestic treble when it was achieved for the first time in Scottish football history in [[1948â49 in Scottish football|season 1948â49]], the success based on the so called ''Iron Curtain''' defence which remained virtually unchanged from 1946 to 1953.

After Bill Struth collected two more domestic doubles in 1950 and 1953, [[Scot Symon]] was appointed as Rangers third manager on 15 June 1954.

==Under Symon==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Scott Symon.jpg|left|thumb|Scot Symon {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
Symon continued Struth's success winning six league championships, five Scottish Cups and four League Cups. He also became the second manager to win the domestic treble in [[1963â64 in Scottish football|season 1963â64]]. Another purple patch began at the end of the 1950s: from 1957 until 1965. Rangers achieved four League titles, plus an equal number of wins in both League and FA Cups. This was the era of [[Jim Baxter|Slim Jim Baxter]], a superb ballplayer who was by turns exhilarating and exasperating.

But though Baxter was to depart for England in 1965, there was a player who had been a first â team regular for the past couple of seasons who would mature into an inspirational leader, a stalwart in the dark blue of Scotland and would eventually manage the club. John Greig was that man, and though Rangers would play out the decade in the shadow of their European Cup â winning neighbours, the foundations were being laid for future success.

In season [[European Cup 1956â57|1956â57]] Symon took Rangers into the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] for the first time but it ended abruptly, going out on to French team [[OGC Nice|Nice]]. The following season however saw Rangers suffer their worst ever defeat to their arch rivals Celtic, losing 7â1 in the League Cup final of 1957. They did however reach the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1960 losing eventually to German club [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] by a record aggregate 12â4 for a Scottish team. In 1961 Rangers became the first British team to reach a European final when they contested the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] final against Italian side [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], only to lose 4â1 on aggregate. Rangers suffered yet more despair in the final of the same competition in 1967, losing 1â0 after extra time to [[Bayern Munich]].

After these disappointments, the pressure was on Symon and he paid the penalty of Celtic's success in Scotland and Europe in October 1967, giving way to his former assistant [[David White (football manager)|Davie White]] after rejecting a move to make him general manager with White in charge of team affairs.

==White takes charge==
[[David White (Scottish footballer)|David White]] was installed as Rangers' fourth manager on 1 November 1967. He had initially come to Rangers as assistant to manager Symon as part of a grooming process, giving him time to learn the ropes and take over when he was ready. However, it didn't turn out that way and the responsibility came too early. White was on his own and in charge after just five months at the club and aged just 34-years-old.

When White took up the reins at Rangers, the team had failed to win the league championship in three seasons, the longest title drought in 50 years. He also happened to be up against one of the greatest ever [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] managers, in [[Jock Stein]], and teams, the [[1967 European Cup Final]] side. White started incredibly well and went on to win 19 of his first 20 league matches in charge, amassing 39 out of a possible 40 points. The only blemish being a 2â2 draw at [[Celtic Park]] on 2 January, which happened to be the sides third game in only four days.

The [[Scottish Cup]] gave White his first defeat as Rangers manager. A third round replay against [[Hearts F.C.|Hearts]] on 13 March looked to be heading for extra time, when in the 87th minute, Donald Ford struck the winner for Hearts. Rangers were out the Cup. Incredibly, this was White's only loss in his first 30 domestic games in charge. A couple of draws in April, and White's first league defeat in the final minute of the final game of the season, 3â2 at home to Aberdeen, cost Rangers the title by two points. Despite accumulating the highest percentage of points won by any Rangers side since [[Bill Struth]]'s first season and collecting 61 points, which would have won the title in 11 of the past 12 seasons, Rangers were beaten by Celtic. Their [[Old Firm]] rivals amassed 63 points and following the Ne'erday derby draw gone on to win all of their remaining league fixtures.

In the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] campaign that season Rangers reached the quarter-finals, meeting [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in March 1968. After a 0â0 draw at Ibrox, two goals in six minutes at [[Elland Road]] in the second leg were enough to see Leeds progress 2â0 aggregate. Leeds United went on to win the Fairs Cup.

The [[1968â69 Rangers F.C. season|1968â69 season]] was to be White's one and only full season in charge at the club. He made two major signings at the start of the season. The first was when he broke the Scottish transfer record and outbid the English Champions [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] to buy [[Colin Stein]] from [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] for Â£100,000. Secondly he paid [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]] Â£50,000 for [[Alex MacDonald (footballer born 1948)|Alex MacDonald]]. The league campaign till the end of November was inconsistent, 4 draws and 3 defeats from 13 matches, although the side did win the first [[Old Firm]] match 4â2 at [[Celtic Park]]. Rangers went on a run from December until April where they lost only once in all competitions, 3â2 away to [[Airdrieonians F.C.|Airdrieonians]] in the league.

The seemed to be unstoppable, an example being one week in the middle of March (15thâ22nd), when Rangers beat [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] 6â0 at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] in the league on the Saturday, with Stein scoring [[hat-trick]] before being sent-off, four days later the side beat [[Athletic Bilbao]] 4â1 at home in the Fairs Cup then followed this three days later by hammering [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] 6â1 in the [[Scottish Cup]] semi-final. Stein's disciplinary record caught up with him and he was suspended from the end of March until the end of the season. Without his goals the team dropped six points from the final six league games and conceded the title to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] by five points.

The route to the [[1969 Scottish Cup Final]] saw Rangers dispose of Hibernian, Hearts and Airdrieonians before meeting Aberdeen in the semi-final. In the final, with Stein suspended, White opted to play [[Alex Ferguson]] rather than [[Sandy Jardine]], purely because of the aerial threat of [[Billy McNeill]] at corners. Ferguson was blamed for a goal that Rangers conceded only two minutes&lt;ref name=&quot;blame&quot;&gt;{{ cite book| title= The Boss | page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; into the match in which he was designated to mark goalscorer McNeill. Two horrendous mistakes from [[Ãrjan Persson]] and [[Norrie Martin]] minutes before the interval, were both seized upon by the 20-year-old [[George Connolly]], resulted in two goals to give Celtic a 3â0 lead at half-time. Rangers lost the game 0â4 and Ferguson was subsequently forced to play for the club's junior side.&lt;ref name=&quot;junior&quot;&gt;{{ cite book| title= The Boss | page = 83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairs Cup proved fertile once again. Rangers went all the way to the semi-finals, defeating [[FK Vojvodina]] (2â1 on aggregate), [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]] (9â1 on aggregate), DWS Amsterdam (4â1 on aggregate), Bilbao (4â3 on aggregate) before losing 0â2 to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on aggregate. The tie was basically lost at Ibrox as Rangers were held to a 0â0 draw, despite numerous chances and yet another missed penalty from [[Andy Penman]]. Newcastle United went on to win the trophy.
----
1969â70

Having brought the legendary Jim Baxter back home, his faith was repaid immediately when in his first game back at Ibrox, the now not so slim Jim masterminded a famous 2â1 comeback victory over Celtic in the League Cup Section qualifier that had the crowd in raptures. In the Cup Winners Cup we beat Steau 2â0 at home, and held out in Bucharest for a 0â0 draw where White cleverly employed John Greig in a sweeper's role.

In the second round, despite losing 1â3 away to Gornik,confidence was still high that we could overcome them at Ibrox. Baxter scored a stunning goal after 18 mins, and it all looked to be going to plan as Rangers sustained pressure continued for the first hour....and then cruelly the game changed...
Gornik started to play and scored three quite brilliant goals in the final half hour as they toyed with Rangers, looking as if they could score at will. Lubanski (who was recently voted Poland's greatest player of the last 50 years) was just superb. Gornik were applauded off the park.

The good showing in Europe did not continue though, and when White completely under-estimated Polish side [[GÃ³rnik Zabrze]], he was removed as manager. White's side had lost 3â1 in Poland and when the return leg at Ibrox began, he was promising to, &quot;attack, attack, attack!&quot; in order to progress. The second-leg result ended in a 3â1 home defeat for the Gers. The next day, 27 November 1969, White's assistant [[Willie Thornton]] took over as caretaker and the club began to look for a new manager.
----

The lack of honours during White's reign at Ibrox, however, masks the fact that he did improve the team during a difficult period. Celtic, under Stein, were at the peak of their success and White, as Rangers' first track suit manager working on the pitch with the players every day, did not fail through any lack of tactical knowledge.

In his two seasons in charge Rangers had finished 2 points and 5 points behind Celtic, and I think we were 2 points ahead of them (though they had two games in hand) when he got fired.
(Hibernian were top the League at that time).

White was replaced by Willie Waddell, the former Rangers legendary winger, who had also won the Championship as a manager in 1965 with Kilmarnock, before returning to journalism with the Daily Express, where he was heavily critical of Rangers, and White in particular, referring to him as 'the Boy David'.

With Waddell in charge, the next three seasons saw Rangers finish 12, 15 and 16 points adrift of Celtic in the Championship â 2 points for a win back then. The team also failed to beat Celtic in 10 of the 11 games it played with Waddell at the helm.

==European success and national tragedy==
[[William Waddell (footballer)|William Waddell]], a former player who had made himself a name both in journalism and as the manager of [[Kilmarnock F. C.|Kilmarnock]]'s championship-winning side of 1964â65, was appointed as Rangers manager on 8 December the same year. In 1972 he guided Rangers to their first, and to date only, European triumph when they defeated [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] 3â2 in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final 1972|Cup Winners' Cup final]] at the [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]]. Due to a [[1972 European Cup Winners' Cup Final riots|pitch invasion]] at the end of the match, the team were presented with the trophy in the dressing room. Following pressure exerted by the Spanish Government of [[Generalissimo]] [[Francisco Franco]], [[UEFA]] banned Rangers from defending the cup.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0047/print.shtml Rangers triumph in Europe 1972]&quot;, ''BBC â Sport Scotland''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was perceived by some as a disproportionate and politically-motivated decision, as evidenced by [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona's]] decision to invite Rangers to participate in their pre-season [[Joan Gamper Trophy|Trofeo Joan Gamper]] tournament (named after [[Joan Gamper|the club's founder]]) in 1974, alongside the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] team [[Athletic Club de Bilbao]]. The triumph in the European Cup Winners' Cup came less than two years after the [[Ibrox disaster]], when 66 people died leaving the east terrace at staircase 13.

Within weeks of their European success, Waddell moved to the general manager position and his coach [[Jock Wallace, Jr.|Jock Wallace]] was appointed as manager. The reasons for the 51 year-old Waddell relinquishing the reins at Rangers were never fully explained but he probably saw the coaching of players as a younger mans job. He also became determined to complete the reconstruction of [[Ibrox Stadium]].

Waddell's spell can only be seen as a unique achievement. In just little over two years he had enforced discipline and order to the club. This in turn brought [[UEFA|European]] success and broke the dominance of Celtic, if only in the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]]. Waddell also oversaw the recovery after the second Ibrox disaster, helping the families of the victims and forging strong links with supports' clubs.

==Wallace becomes manager==
[[Jock Wallace, Jr.|Jock Wallace]]'s managership of Rangers saw the club achieve a period of sustained success. His first season as manager, [[Rangers F.C. season 1972-73|1972â73]] was the club's centenary year. After taking over the first-team managers position on 31 May 1972, Wallace set about reshaping the side. He moved on [[Colin Stein]] and [[Willie Johnston]] to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] respectively, bringing in [[Quinton Young]], Joe Mason and [[Tom Forsyth]].

After a stuttering start to the league campaign, three defeats and a draw from the first six matches, the sides fortunes greatly improved. From October to the end of the season Rangers suffered only one league defeat, at home to [[Hearts F.C.|Hearts]] on 2 December 1972, and went on a run of sixteen wins. However this run was not enough to become league champions as the side finished second, one point behind [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].

In the cup competitions, the [[Scottish Cup]] campaign was to culminate in a 3â2 win over Celtic. The final was attended by [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra]] along with 122,714 other spectators. It was Rangers first Scottish Cup win in seven years. The League Cup run was ended in the semi-finals at the hands of [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] after a 1â0 defeat.

This season also saw compete in the first ever [[1972 European Super Cup|European Super Cup]]. The side played the European Cup holders [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in January 1973. The Dutch side were the only continental opposition the side faced that season due to the club's European competition ban. In the end Ajax proved to strong and recorded a 6â3 aggregate win, with Rangers losing 1â3 at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] and 3â2 in [[Amsterdam]].

In the summer of 1973 Rangers chairman John Lawerence retired and was replaced by vice-chairman Matt Taylor.

A nine-year period of Celtic dominance in the league was ended in [[1974â75 in Scottish football|1974â75]] as Rangers captured what was to be the last championship of its kind. The new ten-team Scottish Premier Division saw Rangers crowned inaugural champions, as part of a triumphant domestic treble. A barren subsequent season in [[Rangers F.C. season 1976-77|1976â77]].

Wallace presided over the club's fourth [[Treble (association football)|domestic treble]] and second in three years in [[Rangers F.C. season 1977-78|1977â78]]. During the close season Rangers spent heavily in the transfer market, bringing in [[Davie Cooper]] from Clydebank for Â£100,000 and [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] from [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] for Â£65,000. They were joined at the club by [[Bobby Russell (footballer)|Bobby Russell]] who arrived from [[Shettleston F.C.|Shettleston Juniors]] for free.

Despite these expensive signings the side did not make the best start to the league campaign, losing the opening two matches to Aberdeen and Hibernian. Order was restored the following week with a 4â0 defeat of Partick Thistle. A resounding 3â2 win over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the first [[Old Firm]] match of the season set the tone of the season. Rangers had been 2â0 down at half-time but recovered to win the game after outclassing [[Jock Stein]]'s side in the second 45 minutes. In March 1978, second placed [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] won 3â0 at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] to set up a tense title run in. Rangers dropped seven points from twenty-one but held on winning the final four fixtures and the league.

The [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] was won by defeating Celtic 2â1 [[Extra time|after extra time]]. Goals from season new boys [[Davie Cooper]] and [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] completed the first leg of the treble. The 2â1 [[Scottish Cup|1978 Scottish Cup Final]] win over Aberdeen made Wallace the first and only Rangers' manager to win two domestic treble's. Surprisingly despite this unprecedented success Wallace resigned from his position on 23 May 1978. The reason for his departure was never revealed but it is widely believed that a breakdown in the working relationship between Wallace and general manager [[William Waddell (footballer)|William Waddell]] was the cause. At a time when [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox Park]] was undergoing extensive redevelopment the transfer budget was to suffer. Waddell was suspected of vetoing many signings, [[Alan Hansen]] from [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] and [[David Narey]] from [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] among them, in favour of investing in the rebuilding project.

The burst of success under Wallace in the mid-1970s saw Rangers once again established as Scotland's most successful club. When Wallace, suddenly and unexpectedly, announced his resignation, Rangers turned to another of the stalwarts of the great side of the mid-to-late 1970s, the captain [[John Greig]].

==Greig: Captain to Manager==
After the departure of Wallace the board acted quickly to replace the void with club captain Greig being promoted to first-team manager. Greig took a phone call on the day of Wallace's resignation from general manager [[William Waddell (footballer)|Waddell]]. Greig was playing golf with team-mate [[Sandy Jardine]] when Waddell called him to offer him the job. On 24 May 1978 Greig was confirmed as the seventh manager of Rangers.

Greig's tenure began promisingly. The [[Rangers F.C. season 1978-79|1978â79 season]] could so easily have mirrored the [[Rangers F.C. season 1977-78|previous]]. Despite a fixture pile-up which resulted from the club playing three league games in nearly three months, and some overly negative tactics from Greig, Rangers came close to winning a quadruple of trophies. Unfortunately it was not to be and the season ended with just the domestic cup double.

Wallace's treble-winning team of the previous season performed ably in the [[European Cup 1978â79|European Cup]]. Rangers eliminated [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] after defeating the [[Italy|Italians]] 2â1 on aggregate â the first time Rangers had ever recovered from a first-leg defeat to win a [[two-legged]] European tie. Dutch side [[PSV Eindhoven]], the then [[UEFA Cup]] holders, were overcome in the next round (the club's first home defeat in European competition), before an injury-stricken Rangers side lost to [[1. FC KÃ¶ln|Cologne]] at the quarter-final stage.

[[File:Johngreig.jpg|John Greig's statue outside Ibrox|left|thumb|120px]]
The early season league form was terrible as the team failed to win any of the first six league matches but a run was put together. Things began to unravel, however, as leadership of the league evaporated. The team had to settle for second place behind champions Celtic. The pivotal match was a 4â2 [[Old Firm]] defeat a [[Celtic Park|Parkhead]]. There was success for Greig in the national cup competitions. Victory in the [[1979 Scottish Cup Final]] over [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] required a second replay to separate the sides before Rangers eventually won 3â2. The [[1978-79 in Scottish football|1979 Scottish League Cup Final]] ended in a 2â1 win for Rangers over a strong [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] with goals from [[Alex MacDonald (footballer born 1948)|Alex MacDonald]] and [[Colin Jackson (footballer)|Colin Jackson]].

The following the season finished trophyless. Rangers finished an embarrassing fifth in the league, eleven points behind champions [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]. The main cause for such a poor showing in the league was pointed at the teams away form, only ten points from eighteen matches. Aberdeen also knocked Rangers out of the [[Scottish League Cup]] over a two-legged third round tie. Rangers did reach the [[1980 Scottish Cup Final]] only to lose out to Old Firm rivals Celtic, 1â0 thanks to a deflected [[George McCluskey]] shot in extra time. The [[European Cup Winner's Cup]] campaign was ended by the eventual winners [[Valencia CF]] after having seen off Lilliestrom and Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf in previous rounds.

The summer of 1980 saw Greig bring in [[Jim Bett]] from [[K.S.C. Lokeren Oost-Vlaanderen|Lokeren]] for Â£150,000. Bett was joined by [[Colin McAdam (footballer)|Colin McAdam]] a Â£165,000 signing from [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]]. The side got off to a good start in the league, going on a fifteen match unbeaten run, including two [[Old Firm]] wins, was to end in November. A disastrous run in November and December all but ended the title challenge as the team finished third, twelve points behind champions [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. The League Cup campaign was halted after a controversial defeat to [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in a match where the Dons were awarded two contentious penalties. Due to having no European participation, Rangers entered the [[Anglo-Scottish Cup]] which led to humiliation and embarrassment at the hands of English minnows, [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]].  The third division side held Rangers to a 1â1 draw at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] before thumping Rangers 3â0 in the away leg at [[Saltergate]]. Rangers did win the [[Scottish Cup 1980-81|1981 Scottish Cup Final]] after beating [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] 4â1 in a final replay. After a tedious 0â0 draw where [[Ian Redford]] missed a last minute penalty, Rangers won the replay with goals from [[Davie Cooper]], a [[John MacDonald (footballer)|John MacDonald]] double and [[Bobby Russell (footballer)|Bobby Russell]].

Greig's fourth season in charge, 1981â82, ended yet again without the league championship. Rangers finished third, twelve points behind [[Old Firm]] rivals Celtic who were champions. There was an apparent lack of ambition at the club due a lack of transfer funds which were being directed towards the redevelopment of [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox Park]]. There was the surpirse signing of [[Northern Ireland]] international [[John McClelland (footballer born 1955)|John McClelland]] from [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]]. The Ulsterman proved to be a shrewd acquisition and later became the club captain. European participation was halted by [[Dukla Prague]] who soundly beat the team 3â0 in [[Prague]] and a 2â1 second leg win for Rangers was not enough for the team to progress. The domestic cup competitions proveded successful ground as Rangers reached both finals. The team lost the [[1982 Scottish Cup Final]] 4â1 to [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] despite leading for the majority of the match. A late Aberdeen equaliser took the game into extra-time before the Dons added a trio. Rangers did win the [[1982 Scottish League Cup Final]] by defeating [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] 2â1 with goals from [[Davie Cooper]] and [[Ian Redford]].

Greig made big-money signings in the pre-season [[Rangers F.C. season 1982-83|1982â83]] with renewed hope that they could at least mount a serious title challenge, but once again, the season ended in trophyless failure. [[Dave MacKinnon]] â Â£30,000 from [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], [[Craig Paterson]] â Â£200,000 from [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], [[Robert Prytz]] from [[MalmÃ¶ FF]] and [[Sandy Clark]] from [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], were all welcomed to the club. The early signs were positive. Rangers reached the [[1983 Scottish League Cup Final]] scoring en route 29 goals in there ten games and eliminated [[Borussia Dortmund]] from the [[UEFA Cup]]. The opening eight league games saw the side unbeaten but the final match saw Rangers lying in fourth, a massive eighteen points behind champions [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. The team was knocked out of Europe after suffering a 5â0 defeat from [[1. FC KÃ¶ln|Cologne]]. The [[1983 Scottish Cup Final]] was lost to an [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] side that had won the [[European Cup Winner's Cup]] ten days earlier.

The [[Rangers F.C. season 1983â84|1983â84]] season would signal the end of John Greig's managerial career. The league season began badly, one point from the first four league games, although the team did win there six League Cup games under Greig. A fruitful brief run in the [[UEFA Cup Winner's Cup|European Cup Winner's Cup]] saw Rangers win the second round, first leg 2â1 over [[FC Porto]] after the team's record breaking 18â0 aggregate win over [[Malta|Maltese]] champions [[Valletta F.C.|Valletta]]. After the first nine league games, Greig's team had collected just ten points from twenty-seven. In the end the pressure was to much and Greig resigned from his post on 28 October 1983.

Greig's efforts to restructure the team inherited from Wallace proved, for the most part, fruitless. The early years of the 1980s were ones of repeated frustration as the club continually failed to mount a challenge not only to Celtic, but to the resurgent [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]] of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. The gloom of under-performance in the league was punctuated only by periodic cup triumphs. The Scottish Cup win of 1981, in particular, saw a triumphant performance by the enigmatic winger, [[Davie Cooper]]. The League Cup proved fertile territory for Rangers throughout the fallow years of the early 1980s, but it was the failure to add to the league triumph of 1978 that saw the growing pressure on Greig culminate in his resignation as manager in October 1983. During this period attendances at Ibrox dwindled from an average 25,628 in season 1978â79 to 17,681 in 1982â83.&lt;ref&gt;''The Roar of the Crowd'', David Ross, 2005, page 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return of Wallace==
[[Image:Jock Wallace.jpg|right|thumb|Jock Wallace]]
Rangers hoped to rekindle success by bringing Jock Wallace back to the club, following his exile in England with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Wallace, though, was not the club's first choice: [[Jim McLean]] and [[Alex Ferguson]], the then managers of the [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]] clubs, both rebuffed Rangers' advances.&lt;ref&gt;P147 {{cite book | coauthors=Bob Ferrier, Robert McElroy |title=Rangers: The Complete Record | publisher=Breedon Books| year=2005| id=ISBN 1-85983-481-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLean's brother [[Tommy McLean|Tommy]] was appointed caretaker manager and four games passed before a permanent manager was in position.

On 10 November 1983, Jock Wallace was persuaded by the Rangers board to leave [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and return to the club. His aim was to restore the glory years of the treble-winning sides of the late 1970s. Wallace's initial impact was positive, boosting morale and fitness. He made changes to the coaching staff, bringing in [[Alex Totten]] as first team coach with [[Tommy McLean]], [[David Provan (footballer born 1941)|David Provan]] and Joe Mason leaving. Wallace also added to the squad during the season, [[Bobby Williamson]] arrived from [[Clydebank F.C.|Clydebank]], [[Nicky Walker]] from old club [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] and [[Stuart Munro]] from [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]].

Wallace's first match in command was at [[Pittodrie Stadium|Pittodrie]] on 12 November 1983. The game ended in a 3â0 defeat but the side went on a 22 match unbeaten run in all competitions until March 1984. Yet, Rangers still ended that season fourth in the league, fifteen points behind champions [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]. The club did win a trophy, the [[1984 Scottish League Cup Final|1984 Scottish League Cup]]. It was a thrilling extra time victory over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], with [[Ally McCoist]] getting a hat-tick, in a 3â2 win that won them the cup.

The [[Rangers F.C. season 1984â85|1984â85 season]], Wallace's first full season in charge since his return, was almost a carbon copy of its predecessor. Rangers again finished fourth in the league but it was by a record twenty-one point margin behind champions [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]. This disappointing performance was not caused due to a lack of investment in the playing squad. A total of Â£495,000 was spent bringing in [[Iain Ferguson]] and [[Cammy Fraser]] from Dundee, [[Ted McMinn]] from Queen of the South and bringing back [[Derek Johnstone]] from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. The club won the [[Scottish League Cup]] for the second season in a row defeating [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in the final. A solitary Iain Ferguson strike gave Rangers a 1â0 win.

A reasonable start was made to Wallace's second full season in charge. Five wins out of six matches in the league plus a further two wins in the League Cup. However, things quickly began to sour as a fall out between manager and then club captain, [[John F. McClelland|John McClelland]] saw the latter stripped of the captaincy. McClelland was soon sold to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in November 1985 for Â£265,000. The [[Ulsterman]] was missed and the team's form was to suffer. By the turn of the year Rangers were in third position in the league. From 1 January 1986, the side won only a quarter of the remaining sixteen league fixtures. With no hope of a trophy, after defeats in the [[Scottish Cup]] third round and the League Cup semi-final, things looked bleak for the club.

So perhaps it came as no surprise that on 7 April 1986, Jock Wallace resigned as manager of the club. He was to jump before being pushed by the then newly appointed Rangers chairman [[David Holmes (businessman)|David Holmes]]. Holmes had gone on record saying that the slump the club was in could not be allowed to go on.

Wallace's side might have won the League Cup twice in a row, but the league form remained indifferent. The continuing dominance of the great [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] side of the 1980s, coupled with strong [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] teams that offered periodic challenges to Aberdeen's ascendancy, placed Wallace under increasing pressure. By the [[Rangers F.C. season 1985â86|1985â86 season]] Rangers had slipped to fifth place in the league and, with little evidence of improvement since the Greig era, it was inevitable that Wallace would be removed as manager. However, the search for Wallace's replacement was a brief one.

==The Souness Revolution==
In April 1986, [[Graeme Souness]] was appointed as Rangers' first [[player-manager]] by chairman [[David Holmes (businessman)|David Holmes]]. Souness had previously been playing in Italy with [[U.C. Sampdoria]] and made the move to [[Glasgow]] for a Â£300,000 fee. This was the first of many big money transfer deals to be made at Rangers. Although the first deal Souness was involved with was regarding his backroom staff. He brought in [[Walter Smith]], from [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] as his assistant and ex-[[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] manager [[Don Mackay]] as reserve-team coach.

Souness' first flurry into the transfer market resulted in a Â£175,000 purchase, [[Colin West]]. The  investment made in West was small compared to that made in other members of the playing staff. Souness took advantage of the European competition ban imposed by [[UEFA]] on English clubs after the [[Heysel Stadium Disaster]]. Due to this, plus a sizeable transfer kitty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/editor-s-picks/25-years-on-the-souness-revolution-1.1095149 | title=25 YEARS ON: The Souness revolution | publisher=Evening Times | date=7 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was able to attract the cream of English sides talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/print?id=616244&amp;type=story&amp;cc=% | title=A very Scottish revolution | publisher=Soccernet | date=9 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of many international players arrived in the shape of [[Chris Woods]], followed by the likes of England deputy captain [[Terry Butcher]] and former [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] defender [[Jimmy Nicholl]].

The [[Rangers F.C. season 1986â87|1986â87 season]] would be the first time in eight seasons that Rangers finished top of the [[Scottish Premier Division]]. But the season began eventfully with player-manager Souness being sent-off in the first league match of the season on 9 August 1986. A violent foul on [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian's]] George McCluskey meant Souness had to watch the 2â1 defeat from the stands. But forty-three matches; thirty-one wins, seven draws and five defeats later Rangers were the champions. The league crown was not Souness' first Rangers trophy however, a 2â1 win over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] gave them a [[1986 Scottish League Cup Final]] win. He also won the [[Glasgow Cup]] thanks to an [[Ally McCoist]] hat-trick.

That same season, goalkeeper [[Chris Woods]] set the then British football shut out record of 1196 minutes. From 26 November 1986, when he conceded a goal in a [[UEFA Cup]] 1â1 draw with [[Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach]], until 14 games later on 30 January 1987 when [[Adrian Sprott]] of [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] knocked Rangers out of the [[Scottish Cup]] by a single goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quinn|first=Bryan |title=Adrian Sprott: Ex-Hamilton Accies|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/special-reports/exprofootballers/2008/01/30/adrian-sprott-ex-hamilton-accies-86908-20303652/|accessdate=1 September 2010|date=30 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season Rangers could not build on the success of the previous. Despite the arrival's of [[Trevor Francis]], [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Mark Walters]], [[Mark Falco]], [[John Brown (footballer born 1962)|John Brown]] and [[Richard Gough (footballer)|Richard Gough]], who became Scotland's first Â£1 million player. The title defence began badly, three points from the first ten, that added with injuries and suspensions meant the club finished third, twelve points behind champions [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. The [[1987 Scottish League Cup Final|League Cup Final]] victory was the only bright spark that season, although there was a decent run the [[European Cup]] with [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kiev]] and David White's foes [[GÃ³rnik Zabrze]] as scalps. A final against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] saw Rangers win 5â3 on penalties after drawing 3â3. The [[Scottish Cup]] ended in the fourth round at the hands of [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]].

==Nine in a row== 
Rangers had previously won nine titles in a row before during the period directly before and following into the [[Second World War]]. However the league championships won during wartime are not officially recongised. Due to the depletion of the squads as players left to help with the war effort, the [[Scottish Football Association]] suspended legitimate competitions and set up regional league competitions in there place.

===Souness years===
The [[1988-89 Rangers F.C. season|1988â89 season]] was to start what would be one of the most successful spells of Rangers history. When Souness' side regained the league championship by a margin of six points from second-placed [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], few could predict that would be the first of many. The club had again invested heavily in the playing staff. Again the club imported players from English sides with [[Gary Stevens]] joining from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Kevin Drinkell]] from [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].

A pre-season spent in Italy was the perfect build-up to the new season. The team were unbeaten in all competitions in August and September, including a 5â1 mauling of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]]. The initiative gained was never really lost and Rangers collected fifty-six points from thirty-six games, twenty-six of which were victories. The [[1988 Scottish League Cup Final|League Cup]] was again at Ibrox as the side again beat a determined [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] team. The final came just a fortnight after the sides met in the league, Rangers lost 2â1 in the [[Granite City]]{{dn|date=November 2011}}. During the game  Aberdeen's [[Neil Simpson]] inflicted a terrible tackle on Rangers midfielder [[Ian Durrant]] which left the latter with a knee injury for over three years. But for a 1â0 defeat to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the [[1989 Scottish Cup Final]], the treble would have rested at Ibrox that season.

The arrival of businessman [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|David Murray]] in 1988 continued the Rangers' resurgence. Murray had acquired Rangers for Â£6 million from the club's then owner, the [[Nevada]]-based Lawrence Marlborough on 23 November 1988. History could have been very different however, had he not been rejected by home town club [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]]. Murray officially became chairman on 2 June 1989, replacing [[David Holmes (businessman)|David Holmes]].

Murray retained the ambitious strategy he had inherited from Holmes. This was demonstrated on 10 July 1989 when Rangers, acting on Souness' say so, purchased former [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] striker [[Mo Johnston]] from French club [[FC Nantes Atlantique|Nantes]] for Â£1.5 million. The fact Rangers signed an ex-Celtic player would have been a big enough story but the fact Johnston was a high-profile Roman Catholic made the move unprecedented. The transfer angered both sides of the [[Old Firm]]'s support, Rangers because Johnston was an ex-Celt and Catholic (Rangers, seen as the Protestant club in Glasgow and signing Catholics was a rare occurrence) and Celtic fans saw Johnston as a [[turncoat]] who had already committed to re-join Celtic from Nantes before Rangers made known their interest.

When the season began, Rangers did not. Three matches played in the league, no wins and two defeats. However, the team slowly got into gear, despite only two wins from the first eight games. New arrival Johnston netted the crucial winner during an [[Old Firm]] game on 4 November 1989. Scoring the goal in the dying minutes of the match meant Johnston was all but forgiven by the Rangers support. Come May 1990, Rangers' name was on the trophy for the second time in as many seasons but the club again failed to win the [[Scottish Cup]], losing to Celtic in the fourth round, and for once did not win the League Cup. The side lost to [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] by 2â1 in the [[1989 Scottish League Cup Final|final]].

The [[Rangers F.C. season 1990-91|1990â91 season]] would be Souness's last season in charge. On 16 April 1991, the fiery Scot departed for his former club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] before the league campaign reached its dramatic culmination, saying he had &quot;gone as far as he would be allowed to go&quot;. A last-day victory over Aberdeen at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] gave Rangers ''Three in a Row''. Souness assistant [[Walter Smith]] was in charge that day. Before his departure Souness had made sure to fall out with and sell on club captain [[Terry Butcher]] and spend big money on striker [[Mark Hateley]], winger [[Pieter Huistra]] and forgotten man [[Oleh Kuznetsov|Oleg Kuznetsov]]. Sadly for Souness though he was never to win a [[Scottish Cup]] with Rangers as the team went down 2â0 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at Parkhead, for the second season in a row. The [[1990 Scottish League Cup Final]] ended in another victory however.

The Souness years were marked by both achievement and conflict. Under Souness's stewardship, Rangers' preeminence in the Scottish game was restored. At a time in which English clubs were excluded from European competition, the club also gained arguably a higher profile in the British game than at any time in its history. This was fuelled by the purchase of a succession of English internationals, including [[Ray Wilkins]], [[Terry Butcher]] and [[Chris Woods]]. It was also fuelled by the controversial signing of [[Roman Catholic]] and former Celtic player [[Mo Johnston]], who was persuaded to change his mind at the last minute and sign for Rangers rather than their bitter city rivals. Johnston's signing led to outrage from some fans of the traditionally Protestant club as he became the first high-profile Catholic to sign for Rangers in modern times.

Despite his success, Souness was never part of the Scottish footballing establishment. His managership saw countless run-ins with the footballing authorities. He was sent off in his debut and suffered more than one touchline ban. Souness's departure met with mixed reactions amongst Rangers supporters. Many were disappointed, some bemoaned what they saw as his betrayal of the club, all however, were united in viewing the Souness revolution as amongst the most dramatic period in Rangers history.

===Smith's tenure===
The ninth manager of Rangers was a man who had previously worked as assistant to the eighth, Walter Smith. He was appointed manager on 19 April 1991, a day before a crucial [[Scottish Premier Division]] match away to [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]]. Smith guided the side to a 1â0 win and followed that with a similar result at home to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] before a devastating 3â0 loss away to [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] nearly derailed the sides championship hopes. A last supreme effort was required if the club was to claim a third league title in succession. The final league game of the season was at home to title challengers [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]], with a draw being all that was needed by the Dons to be crowned champions. A tense match ensured but a [[Mark Hateley]] brace in front of a 37,652-strong [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] crowd gave Rangers the win and the league championship.

In his first full season in charge, Smith began to make changes. He brought in [[Archie Knox]] from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], as his assistant and also altered the playing personnel. Smith moved on [[Trevor Steven]] for a fee of Â£5.58 million to [[Olympique Marseille]]. Amongst those who also left were [[Chris Woods]], [[Mo Johnston]], [[Mark Walters]] to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] respectively. Smith, with the financial backing of Chairman David Murray, signed [[Andy Goram]], [[Alexei Mikhailichenko]], [[Stuart McCall]], [[David Robertson (footballer born 1968)|David Robertson]] and the perhaps less successful pair of [[Dale Gordon]] and [[Paul Rideout]].

A fourth successive championship was secured that season, for the first time in over sixty years. Rangers topped the Division with a total of seventy-two points, nine ahead of second-placed [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]]. The side scored one hundred and one goals and were victorious in nineteen of their twenty-two away fixtures. The success continued into the [[Scottish Cup]] as Rangers won the [[1992 Scottish Cup Final|1992 final]] beating [[Airdrieonians F.C.|Airdrieonians]] 2â1 to win the trophy for the first time in eleven years.

The [[1992-93 Rangers F.C. season|1992â93 season]] was arguably one of the most successful in the club's history and the best [[UEFA|European]] campaign since [[1971-72 Rangers F.C. season|1972]]. Not only did the team win the [[Treble (association football)|domestic treble]] but they also came to within one match of the [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final]]. Rangers saw off English First Division champions [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in a tie dubbed the [[Battle of Britain]]. Then, in the group stage, Rangers won two matches and drew four but, despite remaining undefeated, went out to the French team [[Olympique de Marseille]], who were later found guilty of match fixing. No foul play was found with regards to the Rangers matches however.

Rangers won the double the following season but missed out on a back-to-back domestic treble after losing in the [[1994 Scottish Cup Final]] to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. It was a classic giant killing act. United had had a fairly moderate season, winning only eleven of their forty-four league matches. It was United's seventh appearance in a [[Scottish Cup]] final, having lost all six of their previous encounters. A forty-seventh minute [[Craig Brewster]] goal gave Dundee United a 1â0 win after a sloppy back pass by [[Dave McPherson (footballer)|Dave McPherson]]. It was a strange end to a very successful domestic season for Rangers.

The [[1994-95 Rangers F.C. season|1994â95 season]] saw Rangers make two big money signings, [[Basile Boli]] and [[Brian Laudrup]], for Â£2.7 million and Â£2.4 million respectively. The latter proved to be an absolute bargain. Laudrup became a firm fans favourite during his four year spell with Rangers and was even elected to the [[Rangers F.C. Hall of Fame|Rangers Hall of Fame]]. Boli on the other hand lasted just one season. The French defender completely failed to adapt to the rigours of the Scottish game. Despite the failure of a rather expensive footballer, Rangers continued to rack up the league titles. The sixth consecutive championship won in style. The club sat top of the Scottish Premier Division on sixty-nine points, a whole fifteen points ahead of second placed [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]]. Yet both domestic cup competitions ended before the last eight and the failure to reached the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage, meant that to many, the season was almost regarded as a failure.

Rangers won the championship in season [[1995-96 Rangers F.C. season|1995â96]] with the help of one [[Paul Gascoigne]]. The Englishman was signed 10 July 1995 from Italian side [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]]. He made an instant impact at Rangers, running almost the length of the pitch to score in an [[Old Firm]] match at [[Celtic Park]], during the fifth league game of the season. On 30 December 1995, in a match against Hibernian, Gascoigne 'booked' referee Dougie Smith. Smith had dropped his yellow card and Gascoigne picked it up and showed it to the official, before returning it. Smith was not amused and booked Gascoigne.

Rangers went on to win the league, clinching the title in the penultimate game of the season against [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]. After Rangers went 1â0 down in the early stages, Gascoigne went on to score a hat-trick to give the club a 3â1 victory and the championship. Joining the league crown in the Ibrox trophy cabinet was the [[1996 Scottish Cup Final|1996 Scottish Cup]] which Rangers won after a 5â1 defeat of [[Hearts F.C.|Hearts]]. A hat-trick from [[Gordon Durie]] and a [[Brian Laudrup]] double won Rangers there 27th [[Scottish Cup]] win.

In [[1996â97 in Scottish football|season 1996â97]] Rangers went on to win their ninth championship in a row thereby equalling Celtic's achievement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the cup competitions, they were knocked out of the [[Scottish Cup]] at the quarter-finals stage, losing 2â0 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. But the team won the [[Scottish League Cup]], defeating [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] 4â3. The European campaign proved to be a disaster. Although the team qualified for the UEFA Champions League after a fine 10â3 aggregate win over Russian champions [[FC Alania Vladikavkaz|Alania Vladikavkaz]], they only recorded three points from their six group matches.

The [[1997â98 in Scottish football|season 1997â98]] proved to be Walter Smith's last season as manager and Rangers were unable to win their tenth league championship in a row. The early season form of new signing [[Marco Negri]] gave the team fresh impetus but when the manager [[Walter Smith]] announced that he would leave the club at the end of the season the team's form dipped. The side finished the league on 72 points, two behind champions [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] after taking the title race to the last day of the season.

The club ended the season trophyless for the first time in twelve seasons as they lost the [[Scottish Cup]] final to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] 2â1 and were knocked out [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] in the quarter-finals by [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. In Europe, the club failed to reach the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] group stages and fell at the first hurdle in the [[UEFA Cup]], losing both legs 2â1 to [[RC Strasbourg]]. Smith left Rangers and joined [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]]. Many players from the Nine in a Row era left Rangers including [[Brian Laudrup]], [[Ally McCoist]], [[Ian Durrant]], [[Stuart McCall]] and captain [[Richard Gough (footballer)|Richard Gough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/sport/Choreographed--exit-is-a.6322598.jp|publisher=Scotsman|title=Choreographed exit is a far cry from regime change in '98|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Little General==
[[Image:DickAdvocaat.JPG|right|thumb|Dick Advocaat]]
[[Dick Advocaat]], nicknamed the Little General,{{cite}} succeeded Walter Smith on 1 June 1998. Advocaat, former manager of PSV Eindhoven, was only Rangers' tenth manager and the first non-Scot to hold the position. His appointment was viewed as reflecting a desire to begin to challenge Europe's elite clubs. David Murray, the club's owner and chairman, had long proclaimed that Rangers ought to be judged not just in relation to success in Scotland, but on performance in Europe, and especially in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. But despite being given resources on a scale never before handed to a Rangers manager, success on a larger stage failed to materialise, and the costly legacy of Advocaat's time at Ibrox was a debt that would cripple the club for years.

The scale of these resources made available to Advocaat initially confirmed that the Rangers management was thinking in bold, European terms. Confronted with a rump of players remaining after Smith's departure, Advocaat was furnished with an unprecedented transfer budget over the coming seasons. In total Advocaat spent over Â£36 million on new players in his debut season.

But while Advocaat's record in transfer dealings remained mixed throughout his time at Ibrox, at first the club appeared to be beginning to deliver in playing terms, both in Scotland and (less predictably) Europe. Advocaat's first season saw another domestic treble secured. Performance in Europe was promising, with Bayer Leverkusen defeated in a solid, if unspectacular, UEFA Cup run. In the following season, Advocaat continued to spend big, bringing the likes of [[Michael Mols]] and [[Claudio Reyna]] to Ibrox. A domestic double was secured in Advocaat's second season. In Europe, too, there were signs of greatly improved performance in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], as [[Parma A.C.|Parma]] were defeated en route to qualification for the group stages of the competition.

Rangers entered Advocaat's third season emboldened by the capture of five of the six domestic trophies available in his first two years. However, while the club again qualified for the Champions League group stage, performances in the league began rapidly to disintegrate. Further high-profile signings â [[Tore AndrÃ© Flo]] for a club record Â£12 million, and the Dutch internationalist [[Ronald de Boer]] on a lavish contract{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} â could not reverse the decline. Morale amongst players and supporters plummeted amidst credible rumours of players unrest and dressing room divides. A worsening financial position exacerbated the gathering gloom. The club failed to win a major competition in the [[2000â01 in Scottish football|2000â01 season]], as Celtic swept the domestic board. Having continued in similar fashion in [[2001â02 in Scottish football|2001â02]], and with [[Martin O'Neill]]'s Celtic side once more running away with the championship, Advocaat resigned as manager and took up a general manager position, which he would leave after only 11 months. [[Alex McLeish]] was appointed the new Rangers manager in December 2001.

[[File:Murray Park.JPG|left|thumb|Murray Park]]
Advocaat's tenure at Ibrox had been a paradoxical one. On one hand, Advocaat spearheaded the building of [[Murray Park]] â a Â£14m training complex at Auchenhowie which was viewed as essential if the club was to compete with its European peers in nurturing home-grown talent and developing players. On the other hand, with the club deep in financial difficulty, there was no realistic prospect of boosting its fortunes through further expensive player acquisitions.  The challenge of restoring the club to supremacy in Scotland looked to be an unenviable one for Alex McLeish.

==Financial hangover under McLeish==
Murray appointed ex-Aberdeen defender [[Alex McLeish]] as the clubs eleventh manager on 11 December 2001, joining McLeish was assistant [[Andy Watson (Scottish footballer)|Andy Watson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeish appointment&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/1701609.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers unveil McLeish|date=11 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's choice of manager was met with a lukewarm reaction amongst many Rangers supporters. Many fans viewed it as symptomatic of the downsizing of the club's ambitions, while others saw in McLeish a manager whose mixed fortunes at [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] left him ill-equipped to cope with the demands of managing a high-profile club like Rangers. However, McLeish was the number one managerial target on a four man shortlist. Others said to be included on the list were the then [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] manager [[George Burley]], former Germany coach [[Berti Vogts]] and [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Manager shortlist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/1700336.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Gers step up manager search|date=9 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fans concerns were quickly allayed as McLeish's Rangers team began to display a spirit that had been sorely lacking in the twlight of Advocaat's reign. A [[Scottish Cup]] and [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] double in McLeish's first half-season, [[Rangers F.C. season 2001-02|2001â02]], saw a renewed sense of optimism that Rangers could regain the ascendancy claimed by Celtic under the managership of [[Martin O'Neill]]. A dramatic 3â2 defeat of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the [[2002 Scottish Cup Final]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Celtic 2-3 Rangers&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scottish_cup/1966673.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers win Old Firm final|date=4 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; orchestrated by [[Barry Ferguson]] and marked by a dramatic [[Peter LÃ¸venkrands]] last minute winner, was the perfect end to a disappointing season.

In McLeish's first full season as manager, [[Rangers F.C. season 2002-03|2002â03]], the club won its seventh [[Treble (association football)|domestic treble]]. The [[Scottish Premier League]] title was secured after an astonishingly tense run-in. Going into the final round both sides were equal on 94 points but Rangers had a one-goal advantage and sat top of the league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/2931832.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=SPL goes down to the wire|date=25 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a dramatic last day, a 6â1 victory over [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline Athletic]] denied Celtic the title on goal difference after the Parkhead club beat [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] 4â0. The destination of the title was unknown until the dying seconds of this match as both teams had headed into the game level on points and goal difference. Only a last-minute penalty by [[Mikel Arteta]] clinched the win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/2932016.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers win to clinch title

A victory over Celtic in the [[2003 Scottish League Cup Final]] in March 2003, provided the first leg of the club's latest treble.&lt;ref name=&quot;Celtic 1-2 Rangers&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/2853133.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers retain CIS Cup|date=16 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A somewhat drab and anti-climactic 1â0 victory over Dundee in the [[2003 Scottish Cup Final]] the following May saw a triumphant finalÃ© to the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dundee 0-1 Rangers&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/2946904.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers complete Treble|date=31 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a near-flawless start to McLeish's reign, ruined only by a poor showing in Europe, which Rangers exited in the first round to minnows [[FK Viktoria Å½iÅ¾kov|Viktoria Å½iÅ¾kov]].

The following season, McLeish's initial period as manager proved difficult to sustain. The club's perilous financial position in the wake of the profligacy of the Advocaat era, meant a period of relative austerity. The wage bill had to be slashed as the club embarked on an extensive cost-cutting programme in an attempt to stabilise a mushrooming and unsustainable level of debt. Confronted with a squad of well-paid but ageing players assembled by Advocaat, McLeish was compelled to rebuild without the luxury of the generous transfer kitty enjoyed by some of his predecessors. McLeish was to lose, from his treble winning squad, the inspirational if mistake-prone defender [[Lorenzo Amoruso]], Scottish international winger [[Neil McCann]] and, most damagingly of all, club captain [[Barry Ferguson]]. In their place McLeish was required to rebuild with the selective use of [[Bosman]] free transfers and loan siginings.

After a good start to [[Rangers F.C. season 2003-04|the 2003â04 season]] which saw the side top of the league and qualify for [[UEFA Champions League]] (thanks to a dramatic late goal in Denmark against [[FC Copenhagen]]), the loss of Ferguson shortly afterwards led to a dramatic downturn in results and ultimately a trophyless campaign. McLeish's Bosman signings of experienced players, such as the Brazilian midfielder [[Emerson MoisÃ©s Costa|Emerson]], Norway forward [[Egil Ãstenstad]] and, most damaging of all, the Â£600,000 signing [[Nuno Capucho]], have since entered Ibrox folklore as some of the worst players to play for Rangers.

The [[Rangers F.C. season 2004-05|2004â05 season]] started in the same vein, with McLeish making another poor signing in Serbian midfielder, [[Dragan Mladenovic]], for Â£1m. The Serb would manage less than ten games for the club. On the pitch, the team again fell behind Celtic in the league and exited the Champions League at the qualifying stage. It was rumoured that failure to gain entry into the new [[UEFA Cup]] group stage would see McLeish lose his job, but another late goal and a penalty shoot out win over [[CS MarÃ­timo]] of Portugal provided him with a stay of execution. After this, his fortunes began to turn again. Mladenovic aside, McLeish had made some canny signings in the summer, such as [[Nacho Novo]], plus the Bosmans [[Dado PrÅ¡o]], [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] along with midfielder [[Alex Rae (footballer born 1969)|Alex Rae]]. Once these players settled in, the team began to recover ground on O'Neill's ageing Celtic side. Boumsong, in particular, was a great success but he was sold in January 2005, after only six months at the club, to then [[Premier League]] side [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] (managed by former boss [[Graeme Souness]]) for Â£8m. This cash paved the way for more signings, including [[Thomas Buffel]], [[Sotirios Kyrgiakos]] and the return of former captain Barry Ferguson.

The [[2005 Scottish League Cup Final]] in March 2005 ended in a 5â1 victory over Motherwell
.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rangers 5-1 Motherwell&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newswww.bbc.net.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/4359199.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers 5â1 Motherwell |date=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The league, however, appeared to have been lost. Despite catching and overtaking Celtic (with two [[Old Firm]] wins, including a pivotal 2â0 victory at [[Celtic Park]] in what was McLeish's first win there as Rangers manager) nerves seemed to get the better of Rangers. A loss to Celtic in the last derby of the season at Ibrox, handed a five-point lead to their rivals with only four games of remaining, and seemed to end hopes of the title. However, Rangers kept its winnings way and a 3â1 Celtic home loss to Hibernian meant only two points separated the sides going into the final game of the season. Rangers needed to win at Hibernian and hope that Celtic would drop points at [[Fir Park]]. In perhaps even more dramatic circumstances than two years previously.
,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibernian 0-1 Rangers&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4565709.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Hibernian 0â1 Rangers |date=22 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motherwell overcame a 1â0 deficit with two goals in injury time from [[Scott McDonald]] to defeat the Parkhead side, while Rangers edged out a tight 1â0 win at Easter Road. For 89 minutes of the match, Rangers thought their rivals were set for the title, and once news broke of Motherwell's late intervention, ecstasy awaited for the Ibrox legions. Even the helicopter that was carrying the league trophy was on its way to Motherwell so it had to turn around and fly to Edinburgh. That day has passed into Ibrox folklore, becoming known as ''Helicopter Sunday''. McLeish could celebrate his second, and Rangers' 51st, league title.

The [[Rangers F.C. season 2005-06|2005â06 season]] got off to a bad start, with Rangers only winning six league games out of the first 17, being knocked out of the League Cup by Celtic in the process. The period from October through to early December saw the team embark on, statistically, the worst run in their history, going ten games without a win. During this time, however, the club became the first Scottish side to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, yet there was still significant pressure on McLeish from fans due to the club's poor position in the domestic league table. It was widely felt that chairman David Murray would let McLeish go after the European campaign had finished, and a press conference arranged two days after the final group match seemed to confirm this.

However, Murray seemed to undergo a change of heart and stated that McLeish would remain in charge indefinitely
,&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray backing&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4503564.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=McLeish receives Murray's backing|date=8 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did concede that domestic results would need to improve. After this announcement, the team improved, helped by the signing from Kilmarnock of [[Kris Boyd]]. The side strung together a ten-match unbeaten run. Yet, entering the crucial month of February, which was to feature a must-win Old Firm match and the resumption of European football, this evaporated. Rangers lost 3â0 at home to Hibernian on 4 February to exit the Scottish Cup and end their last realistic hopes of silverware that season. Protests against McLeish and the chairman followed the game. &lt;!-- (more about that season) --&gt;

Overall, McLeish's four-and-a-half-year spell at Ibrox was a turbulent one, coming as it did after the wastefulness of the Advocaat era. McLeish never enjoyed access to the funds his predecessors had been given, and his managership was marked by wildly-fluctuating fortunes, in part caused by forced [[asset stripping]] of his best players due to the spectre of debt from Advocaat's spending. The lack of money certainly played its part in McLeish's downfall but it is debatable, based on the money he did have to spend, whether greater sums would have been invested wisely. Indeed there is an argument that a good proportion of McLeish's signings have been among the worst in the club's entire history. However, history will look back on McLeish's reign, as a period of tremendous transition on and off the pitch.

==The False Dawn==
After signs that supporter unrest was turning on Murray, on 9 February 2006, two days before the crucial [[Old Firm]] match, it was announced that McLeish would leave his position as manager at the end of the 2005â06 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeish depart&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4697444.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=McLeish to leave Rangers in May|date=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 11 March, it was confirmed that former [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] manager Paul Le Guen would succeed him at the end of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Guen arrive&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/4791030.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers name Le Guen as manager|date=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray predicted a fruitful reign under Le Guen, describing his capture as &quot;a massive moonbeam of success&quot; for the club and promising, &quot;weâve got big plans.&quot;&lt;ref name=Moonbean&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/scotland/article2176234.ece &quot;Murrayâs moonbeam vision doomed to destruction right from the outset&quot;] The Times (1 August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He announced that the Frenchman would be given significant funds with which to strengthen the squad, with Rangers having announced an arrangement with sports retailer [[JJB Sports]].

Le Guen was well known for unearthing and nurturing young talent and made an immediate splash in the transfer market. The wave of expectation that was created by Le Guen's appointment was immense and he quickly went about building his own team. In the summer of 2006 he made eleven signings (of them only [[SaÅ¡a Papac]] would be playing for the club the following season). Le Guen spent big money on [[Filip Å ebo]], which proved to be wasted as the [[Slovakia]]n only netted twice during the whole campaign. Other signings including [[Karl Svensson]], [[Libor Sionko]] and [[Lionel Letizi]] simply did not perform, while [[JÃ©rÃ©my ClÃ©ment]] was to be in [[Glasgow]] for only six months.

He signed a young South African player [[Dean Furman]] from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], and French youngsters [[William Stanger]] and Antoine Ponroy from [[Stade Rennais FC|Rennes]]. He allowed more experienced players to leave, [[Alex Rae (footballer born 1969)|Alex Rae]], [[Sotirios Kyrgiakos]], [[Peter LÃ¸venkrands]] and [[Ronald Waterreus]].
[[File:Rangers F.C. Tifo.jpg|Card display at Ibrox to welcome Le Guen|thumb|right]]

Rangers' first match under Le Guen was a friendly against [[Irish Premier League]] champions [[Linfield F.C.|Linfield]] on 6 July 2006 at [[Windsor Park]], [[Belfast]]. The side won 2â0 with first-half goals from [[Kris Boyd]] and [[Thomas Buffel]]. The squad then flew out to South Africa on 9 July for a training camp where they were to play three matches, but defender [[Fernando Ricksen]] did not take any part in the tour of South Africa due to what was described by the club as &quot;unacceptable behaviour&quot; on the flight to [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ricksen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rangers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Headlines/0,,5~865465,00.html|publisher=Rangers F.C. website|title=Official Statement|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Scotland and was subsequently loaned to [[Zenit St Petersburg]] on 9 August. Ricksen never played for the club again as his loan spell in Russia was made permanent.

The [[Scottish Premier League]] season opened on 30 July with Le Guen taking his Rangers side to [[Fir Park Stadium|Fir Park]] where they defeated [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] 2â1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Motherwell 1-2 Rangers&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/5223938.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Motherwell 1â2 Rangers |date=30 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Le Guen's first competitive game at Ibrox, Rangers were held to a 2â2 draw by Dundee United, and were forced to come back from two goals down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/5245078.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers 2â2 Dundee United |date=5 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August Rangers signed [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s then 19-year-old winger [[Lee Martin (footballer born 1987)|Lee Martin]] on loan for a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Martin heads north |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&amp;newsid=354207 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=11 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers also recruited the services of [[FK Austria Wien|Austrian Vienna]] defender [[SaÅ¡a Papac]] while [[Marvin Andrews]], [[Olivier Bernard]], [[Robert Malcolm]] and [[Hamed Namouchi]] all departed.

With the transfer window closed and five league matches played, Rangers had collected nine points from fifteen. The following two months showed little improvement as the side had sporadic wins and lost the first [[Old Firm]] match of the season 2â0. From the seven matches played in September and October 2006, the team won just three and gathered ten points from the twenty-one available.

By mid November, Rangers found themselves in third place, a full fifteen points behind leaders Celtic. The odd win was mixed with regular dropped points as the team struggled to find consistency in the early part of the season. The culmination of this poor form could be seen when the side was embarrassingly knocked out of the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] by then [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] side [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]]. A dismal 2â0 defeat at [[Ibrox Stadium]] on 8 November led to widespread calls for Le Guen to leave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/6123792.stm &quot;Rangers 0â2 St Johnstone&quot;] BBC Sport. 8 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6127090.stm &quot;Le Guen sorry for Rangers defeat&quot;] BBC Sport. 9 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the League Cup defeat, there was a slightly gain in form as the side claimed sixteen points from twenty-one, including a 1â1 [[Old Firm]] draw thanks to a late-minute [[Brahim Hemdani]] equaliser. Rangers also became the first Scottish club to qualify from the [[UEFA Cup]] group stage in December 2006, after wins over [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] and [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]]. Domestic results and performances, however, continued to be inconsistent and in January 2007, Le Guen controversially stripped midfielder Barry Ferguson of the [[Captain (association football)|captaincy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gers strip Ferguson of captaincy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6223023.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Gers strip Ferguson of captaincy|date=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 2007, Le Guen left Rangers by mutual consent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Guen leaves&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6231489.stm.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Le Guen and Rangers part company|date=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made him the club's shortest-serving manager, and the only one to leave the club without completing a full season in charge. Later that year, sports journalist [[Graham Spiers]] published a book which speculated Le Guen left the club because he was being &quot;undermined&quot; by other Rangers personnel. Those named were Ferguson and the then club doctor, Ian McGuinness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/catalog/book.htm?command=Search&amp;db=main.txt&amp;eqisbndata=1845962915 Paul Le Guen: Enigma â A Chronicle of Trauma and Turmoil at Rangers], Random House, ISBN 1845962915&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walter Smith's return==
Following the departure of Paul Le Guen, a number of media sources reported an &quot;understanding&quot; that the new management structure would consist of former Rangers manager [[Walter Smith]] and former player [[Ally McCoist]], and the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] confirmed that Rangers enquired about the availability of the pair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter Smith approach&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6233237.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers' Smith approach revealed|date=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 8 January, the SFA rebuffed Rangers' approach for Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6233237.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=SFA reject Rangers' Smith move|date=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January 2007 it was announced that Walter Smith was the new manager of Rangers, with Ally McCoist confirmed as assistant manager and [[Kenny McDowall]] as first team coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith return&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/6233237.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Smith installed as Rangers boss|date=10 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith and his team undertook some serious surgery to the side. He signed experienced defenders [[David Weir]], [[Ugo Ehiogu]] and [[Andy Webster]] to sure up rocky backline. This proved to be a steadying influence on the team and they only lost three times until the end of the season. Although Webster injured himself during his first training session at the club and did not make his debut until September 2007.

[[Image:Barcelona vs Rangers 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alan Hutton takes on Barcelona left back [[Ãric Abidal]] during the match at the [[Camp Nou]].]]
The following summer Smith made ten signings, including defender [[Carlos CuÃ©llar]] and midfielder [[Lee McCulloch]]. The early season priority, qualification for the [[UEFA Champions League 2007â08#Group stage|Champions League group stage]] was secured after aggregate victories over the champions of the Montenegrin and Serbian leagues, [[FK Zeta]] and [[Red Star Belgrade]] respectively. Rangers were drawn in Group E, to play [[FC Barcelona]], French champions [[Olympique Lyonnais]] and German champions [[VfB Stuttgart]]. The campaign started well for Rangers with two victories, 2â1 at home to Stuttgart and 3â0 against Lyon at the [[Stade Gerland]] as well as a 0â0 draw against Barcelona at [[Ibrox Stadium]]. They lost match day six against [[Olympique Lyonnais]] 3â0 which ended their [[UEFA Champions League 2007â08]] run. But the adventure continued as they progressed to the final of the [[UEFA Cup]], defeating [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], [[Werder Bremen]], [[Sporting Lisbon]] and [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] along the way. They beat Italian side Fiorentina on penalties to set up a [[2008 UEFA Cup Final|final]], in Manchester, against [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit St. Petersburg]] who are managed by former Gers manager [[Dick Advocaat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/7372080.stm | title=Fiorentina 0â0 Rangers (0â0) | publisher=BBC Sport | date=1 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team lost that match 2â0, amid [[2008 UEFA Cup Final riots|serious disturbances]] caused by small sections of the 100,000 strong Rangers support. Video evidence was released by the [[Greater Manchester Police]] of suspected Rangers fans attacking officers in [[Manchester city centre]] following the defeat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/7402858.stm BBC News CCTV shows fans chasing police] BBC News. 15 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An appeal was launched on BBC's Crimewatch program in January 2009 in an attempt to trace 49 men in connection with the riots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7844997.stm &quot;Fans sought over Uefa Cup rioting&quot;] BBC News (27 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the domestic front, the race for the [[Scottish Premier League]] continued until the final match-day of the season. Both [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] were tied on 86 points going into their games (against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] respectively) on 22 May 2008, but Celtic were top of the table due to having a better goal difference of 57, four ahead of Rangers. This did not prove to be decisive, as Rangers surrendered their hopes of landing the championship with a 2â0 defeat away to the Dons. The club had had a ten-point lead in late March.

The club appeared in its first final since 2005. They played [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] on 16 March 2008 and won the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] on penalties. The match was tied 2â2 after extra time, with both goals coming from [[Kris Boyd]] who also scored the winning spot kick. They also reached the [[2009 Scottish Cup Final]], the clubs 50th appearance in a [[Scottish Cup]] final. The side had beaten [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]] 4â3 on penalties in the semi-final after the score was tied at 1â1 after extra time. The final was against [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] and played on 24 May 2008. Rangers won the match 3â2 thanks to goals from [[DaMarcus Beasley]] and a double from [[Kris Boyd]].

The 2008â09 season began disastrously as the club exited the [[UEFA Champions League 2008â09|UEFA Champions League]] and European football altogether, losing 2â1 on aggregate to [[Lithuania]]n side [[FBK Kaunas]] in the [[UEFA Champions League 2008â09#Second qualifying round|second qualifying round]]. The first leg at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] finished goalless, but the return leg ended in defeat for Rangers after an 87th-minute header from [[Linas Pilibaitis]]. The financial consequences of the failures to qualify for the Champions League were revealed when the club posted a loss of Â£3.9m for the six months to December 2008, and in March decided to offer staff the option of voluntary redundancy as a way of cutting costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/7929976.stm &quot;Rangers offer redundancy packages&quot;] BBC News. 7 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also mounting pressure on the manager to reduce the first team squad from 28 players to a more manageable figure. The player excess was eased slightly with the departures of [[Chris Burke (footballer)|Chris Burke]], [[Jean-Claude Darcheville]] and a couple out on loan deals but the increased debt meant that the club needed to find a cash injection. This resulted in the attempted sale of [[Kris Boyd]] to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] which fell through due to the players wage demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/7813579.stm &quot;Blues end bid to sign Gers' Boyd&quot;] BBC Sport (8 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first [[Old Firm]] game of the season, Rangers won 4â2, with [[Pedro Mendes]] scoring his first goal for the club, and [[Kenny Miller]] scoring a double against his former employers. But the teams league form stuttered thereafter. Despite a run of five wins from six matches following the Old Firm victory, the side trailed Celtic by seven points in the league at the turn of the year. For the first few months of 2009 both sides dropped and gained points on the other and Rangers briefly took over top spot of the [[Scottish Premier League]] on 21 February after a win against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]]. The spell as league leaders lasted less than a fortnight. A defeat and a draw, both at home, to [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness]] and [[Hearts F.C.|Hearts]] respectively, saw Smith's side sit second in the table, one point behind Celtic, at the split. The fourth [[Old Firm]] league meeting of the season finished with a 1â0 win to Rangers, thanks to a [[Steven Davis]] strike. This meant that, with three league games remaining, Rangers were two points ahead of Celtic. Further twists and turns followed, both Old Firm sides drew their matches against [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] at [[Easter Road]], and so Rangers were ahead by two points with one round of matches remaining. Smith's side just needed a win against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] to guarantee the club's 52nd league title. That is exactly what they got, goals from [[Kyle Lafferty]], [[Pedro Mendes]] and [[Kris Boyd]] sealed a 3â0 win and the clubs first league championship in four seasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/8062744.stm &quot;Dundee United 0â3 Rangers&quot;] BBC Sport (24 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The club played in the finals of both of the domestic cup competitions for the second season running. The [[2009 Scottish League Cup Final]] was reached by defeating Partick Thistle, Hamilton and Falkirk en route but the final ended in a 2â0 defeat at the hands of Old Firm rivals [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] after extra time. The match was [[Walter Smith]]'s first ever Old Firm final and was marred by a [[Kirk Broadfoot]] sending off deep into extra time for a foul on [[Aidan McGeady]] inside the penalty box. Celtic were subsequently awarded a penalty which McGeady himself converted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/7941624.stm &quot;Celtic 2â0 Rangers&quot;] BBC Sport (15 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers qualified for the [[2009 Scottish Cup Final]] after beating [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] 3â0 in the semi-final. The second goal of the game was scored by [[Kris Boyd]] and was his 100th goal for Rangers. The team faced [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] at [[Hampden Park]] on 30 May 2009 in what was the clubs 51st Scottish Cup Final appearance. A [[Nacho Novo]] strike in the first minute of the second half gave Rangers a 1â0 win and completed the domestic double.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_cups/8072822.stm &quot;Rangers 1â0 Falkirk&quot;] BBC Sport (30 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season saw Rangers financial problems continue. A quiet summer in terms of transfer arrivals contrasted to the outgoings. The club removed eleven players who had made first team appearances from the wage bill on permanent and loan deals. The only addition to the playing staff was [[JÃ©rÃ´me Rothen]] on a season loan, Rothen was the first player to sign for the club in over a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8231183.stm &quot;Rangers tie up Rothen deal&quot;] BBC Sport (1 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August, chairman [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|David Murray]] stepped down and was replaced by non-executive director [[Alastair Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8223058.stm &quot;Murray relinquishes Rangers role&quot;] BBC Sport (26 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston stated that one of his main priorities was to find a buyer for owner Murray's shares.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8279596.stm &quot;Johnston reveals Gers objectives&quot;] BBC Sport. 28 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 October, Rangers manager [[Walter Smith]] was reported to say that [[Lloyds Banking Group]], who the club was in debt to, was &quot;effectively running the club&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8324603.stm &quot;Clarity required for Rangers sale&quot;] BBC Sport (27 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8325691.stm &quot;Smith admits he could leave Ibrox&quot;] BBC Sport. 26 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November, the extent of the clubs financial problems was shown to be Â£31m in debt, a rise of Â£10m from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/8356651.stm &quot;Rangers' debts increase to Â£31m&quot;] BBC News. 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the field, Rangers' [[Scottish Premier League]] title defence got off to a stuttering start, three wins in the league was followed by three draws, the first [[Old Firm]] victory of the season was followed by poor performances against [[St. Johnstone F.C.|St. Johnstone]] and dropped points at home to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. The side lost their first league match of the season away to [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] on 28 November but then embarked on a six match winning run, scoring 26 goals in the process. At the start of 2010, Rangers sat at the top of the league. The second Old Firm fixture finished in a 1â1 draw. Rangers had a ten point lead by mid February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/8510618.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers 3â0 Hibernian|date=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers won the third Old Firm match 1â0 thanks to an injury time winner from [[Maurice Edu]] which all but secured the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/8537948.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Rangers 1â0 Celtic|date=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The side had to wait nearly two months to be confirmed as champions due to dropping points to St. Johnstone and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]]. On 25 April Rangers won their 53rd league title after defeating Hibernian 1â0 at [[Easter Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/8638892.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Hibernian 0â1 Rangers|date=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the domestic cup competitions Rangers won the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] after a 1â0 victory over [[St. Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in the [[2010 Scottish League Cup Final|final]], despite being reduced to nine men with [[Danny Wilson (Scottish footballer)|Danny Wilson]] and [[Kevin Thomson]] being sent off. However, Rangers were unable to retain the [[Scottish Cup]] after losing 1â0 to eventual winners [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] in a quarter-final replay. 

Rangers were seeded in pot two of the [[2009â10 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League group stage]] for the first time. The club was drawn against Spanish team [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], German outfit [[VfB Stuttgart|Stuttgart]] and Romanian champions [[FC Unirea Urziceni|Unirea Urziceni]]. A 1â1 away draw in Germany was followed by two consecutive 4â1 defeats at home to Sevilla and Unirea, the latter being regarded as one of the clubs worst ever [[UEFA|European]] results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/nov/03/champions-league-rangers-unirea-urziceni &quot;Walter Smith urges Rangers to avenge 'worst ever' defeat&quot;] guardian.co.uk (3 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/rangersfc/Rangers-suffer-their-worst-.5751253.jp &quot;Rangers suffer their worst humiliation&quot;] The Scotsman. 21 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Rangers were left with a small chance of qualifying from the group after a 1â1 draw in the return leg with Unirea, a match that saw trouble in the Rangers fans section of the stadium. The club was charged by UEFA for inappropriate conduct&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8343684.stm &quot;Rangers charged over fan violence&quot;] BBC Sport (5 November 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and following an investigation fined â¬20,000 plus ordered to pay the cost of repairing the damage to the stadium infrastructure caused by its supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/8356348.stm &quot;Rangers and Unirea fined by Uefa&quot;] BBC Sport. 12 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The side finished bottom of there group and was knocked out of [[UEFA|European football]] altogether after two defeats from in the final two matches.

With financial problems at the club ongoing, the summer of 2010 began for Rangers with several players leaving the club. With a limited transfer budget and a small squad. Smith had to decided whether to increase the number of playing staff or improve the starting eleven, he opted for quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/aug/20/rangers |title=Nikica Jelavic's arrival empties transfer kitty at Rangers |date=20 August 2010 |publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both sides of the [[Old Firm]] began the season with eight league wins in a row, however, with the sides meeting on matchday nine something had to give. Rangers claimed a 3-1 victory over [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and took early control of the league. A 1-1 draw at home to [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] the following weekend ended Rangers 100% start to the season and a home defeat to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] inflicted the teams first league defeat of the season, the first of five. The [[Winter of 2010â2011 in Great Britain and Ireland|cold spell in the winter of 2010-11]] saw many postponements and for long spells Rangers were behind Celtic but with games in hand. In the third league meeting between the [[Old Firm]], Celtic came out on top and mathematical lead the table, for the first time that season. However Celtic's advantage was short lived after a loss to Motherwell the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9406152.stm | publisher=BBC Sport | title=Motherwell 2-0 Celtic | date=27 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed Rangers to regain top spot, but 3-2 loss to Dundee United at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] followed by a 0-0 draw in the final Old Firm fixture left the title in Celtic's hands, with just four matches remaining. There was to be a final twist in the league season, on 3 May Celtic lost a rearranged match away to Inverness and so with three matches remaining Rangers had a one point lead. Smith's side went on to win all three fixtures, scoring 11 goals, and claimed the club's 54th league championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/13399953.stm | title=Photo gallery - The story of the 2010/11 SPL title | publisher=BBC Sport | date=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the domestic cup competitions Rangers won the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] after beating Celtic 2-1 [[Overtime (sports)|AET]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celtic 1-2 Rangers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9428470.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Rangers lost 1-0 to Celtic in the fifth round replay in [[Scottish Cup]]. The match was marked by several incidents, three Rangers players were sent-off and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] manager [[Neil Lennon]] and Ally McCoist were involved in a bust up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celtic 1-0 Rangers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9409758.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Rangers automatically qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stages for the second season in a row. They drew [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Valencia C.F.|Valencia]] and [[Bursaspor]]. Rangers were unbeaten in their first three group stage games, with a 0-0 draw at [[Old Trafford]], a 1-0 victory over Bursaspor at Ibrox and a 1-1 draw at home to Valencia. A 3-0 defeat in Spain to Valencia followed by a 1-0 loss at home to Manchester United ended Rangers chances of qualifying for the last 16, but third place and a spot in the [[UEFA Europa League]] was already secured with Bursaspor having failed to pick up a point in five games. In the last group match Rangers drew 1-1 in Turkey, giving Bursaspor their first Champions League point. However, Rangers did make it to the last 16 of the Europa League, beating [[Sporting CP|Sporting Lisbon]] on away goals in the last 32 but lost to [[PSV Eindhoven]] on aggregate.

On 6 May 2011, it was confirmed that [[David Murray (Scottish businessman)|David Murray]] had sold his controlling interest in the club (85.3%) to Wavetower Limited for Â£1, a company ultimately owned by businessman [[Craig Whyte]] a lifelong supporter of the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whyte completes takeover of Rangers&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13292829.stm | title=Craig Whyte completes takeover of Rangers for Â£1 | publisher=BBC Sport | date=6 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
