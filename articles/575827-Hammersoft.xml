'''774 ABC Melbourne''' is an [[ABC Local Radio]] station in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Originally known by its [[callsign]] '''3LO''', it began transmission on 13 October 1924 â Melbourne's second radio station after [[Radio National|3AR]].

==History==
The station was initially owned by the Broadcasting Company of Australia, which represented, amongst others, J and N Tait (theatrical entrepreneurs), Buckley and Nunn Limited (a department store) and [[The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd]] (a newspaper company).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/03/06/2181679.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after ''2LO'' in England, where the ''LO'' stood for London. 

The station began transmission with an outside broadcast of a performance of 'La Boheme' featuring Dame Nellie Melba, from His Majesty's Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/melbourne/about/?ref=footer&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1928 the [[Postmaster-General's Department]] (PMG) was responsible for the technical side of all Australian A Class stations including 3LO. The [[Australian Broadcasting Company]] was given a licence to provide all programming â an arrangement which remained until 1932 when the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]] was formed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RADIO_HIST_AUS.html&lt;/ref&gt; The two Melbourne stations (3LO &amp; 3AR) had a studio in a laneway off Russell Street, near Little Collins Street and the building of Broadcast House in [[Lonsdale Street]] in 1945.  The studios were transferred to the ABC's new Southbank Centre in 1995.

In its early days the station was involved in programs like Kindergarten of the Air, giving children in regional areas greater social awareness and preparation for school.

In early 2006, with the start of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games]], the ABC set up what was known as &quot;The G-Spot&quot; at [[Federation Square]] â an outside broadcast studio where members of the public could watch and participate in the broadcast. At the same time, 774 ABC Melbourne became the second Local Radio station to introduce streaming broadcasts in addition to its regular radio broadcast, subject to sporting rights and legal concerns.

==Today==
3LO now broadcasts as ''774 ABC Melbourne'', providing a mix of local and national news, [[talk radio|talkback]] and [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] and sports programming. During part of the day it is also identified as ''774 ABC Melbourne'' and ''ABC Victoria'', as much of its content is also heard on other stations in the [[ABC Local Radio]] network in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]. It is also available through online streaming.

3LO's 774&amp;nbsp;kHz [[transmitter]] is located in [[Delahey, Victoria|Delahey]], 20&amp;nbsp;km north-west of Melbourne's central business district.  The station broadcasts at a power of 50,000 [[watt]]s, covering the majority of Victoria, and one of two transmitters using the callsign 3LO, the other being at Marengo on 89.5&amp;nbsp;MHz with an EIRP of about 327 watts serving the Apollo bay area.

774 ABC Melbourne currently live broadcasts during events in a media partners or radio outside broadcasts of [[Gardening Australia|Gardening Australia Expo]], [[Melbourne Comedy Festival|Melbourne International Comedy Festival]], [[Antenna Awards|C31 Melbourne Antenna Awards]], [[Royal Melbourne Show]], [[Geelong Showgrounds|Royal Geelong Show]], &amp; more.

The station is housed in the ABC Southbank Centre, which has four levels incorporating ABC Local Radio, ABC Radio National, [[ABC Classic FM]], [[Triple J]], [[ABC DiG|ABC Dig Music]], [[Radio Australia]], [[Australia Network]], [[ABC News and Current Affairs]], &amp; [[ABC Television|ABC TV]].

774 ABC Melbourne is an official Emergency Services Broadcaster, a role it notably filled during the [[Black Saturday bushfires]] and recovery in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/melbourne/about/?ref=footer&lt;/ref&gt;
