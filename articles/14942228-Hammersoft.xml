==Reception==
===Critics===
Amber Wilkinson of ''[[Eye For Film]]'' gave the film four out of five stars, and praised the musical aspects, saying that &quot;the song and dance numbers are so well-handled and catchy, it's a shame there aren't more of them.&quot; However, she also said that the &quot;characters are so wafer thin they barely cast a shadow.&quot;&lt;!-- Spelling error in source is trivial; per guidelines, correct quietly --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeforfilm.co.uk/reviews.php?film_id=15319 Eye for Film|title=Another Cinderella Story Movie Review (2008)|work=[[Eye For Film]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Wilkinson says that the film is completely different from ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'', Lacey Walker, reviewing for ''Christian Answers'', notes several aspects of the two films that were directly parallel to each other. Walker also gave it three out of five stars, praising the script, saying the writers &quot;peppered this story with a surprising dose of humor and some pleasing plot twists.&quot; However, Walker specifically criticized the &quot;glaringly obvious&quot; age difference between the 15 year old Gomez and the 25 year old Seeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiananswers.net/spotlight/movies/2008/anothercinderellastory2008.html|title=Another Cinderella Story Movie Review |publisher=christiananswers.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
