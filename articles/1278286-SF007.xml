'''Download.com''' is an [[Internet]] [[download]] directory [[website]], launched in 1996 as a part of [[CNET]]. Originally, the domain was ''download.com.com''. The domain ''download.com'' attracted at least 113 million visitors annually by 2008 according to a [[Compete.com]] study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteanalytics.compete.com/download.com?metric=uv Download.com attracts over 100m visitors yearly]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Download.com offers content in four major categories: ''software'' (including Windows, Mac and mobile), ''music'', ''games'', and ''videos'', offered for download via [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] from Download.com's [[Server (computing)|server]]s or third-party servers. Videos are streams (at present) and music was all free [[MP3]] downloads, or occasionally [[Digital rights management|rights-managed]] [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]s or streams until it was replaced with [[last.fm]].

The Software section includes over 100,000 [[freeware]], [[shareware]], and try-first downloads. Downloads are often rated and reviewed by editors and contain a summary of the file from the software publisher. Registered users may also write reviews and rate the product.

==Downloads==
Downloading all software is free. Some software titles are trial versions; many are freeware and shareware. There is no charge by Download.com to access any content on the site. Software publishers are permitted to distribute their titles for free via CNET's [http://www.upload.com/ Upload.com] site, or for a fee structure that offers enhancements.

In 2004, Download.com Music was launched to replace the defunct [[MP3.com]]. One may download music in a variety of genres for free from this area of the site, and the artists range from amateurs to professionals. Artists may upload their information and songs to the site for free. All submissions go through a review process. On March 11, 2009, the music section was replaced with [[Last.fm]].

In July 2005, Download.com Video was launched with streaming video content in a variety of genres (movies and TV, sports, animation, music videos, etc). Download.com plans to offer downloadable videos in future.

In August 2011, Download.com introduced an installation manager for delivering many of the software titles its catalog. The installation manager will offer to install add-ons like browser toolbars and change default homepages before downloading the software the user wanted. Users registered with Download.com can access files either with the Download.com installer or directly via &quot;Download Direct Links&quot;.
