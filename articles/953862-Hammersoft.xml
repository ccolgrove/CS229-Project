'''Bobbie Eakes''' (born '''Bobbie Diane Eakes''' on July 25, 1961 in [[Warner Robins, Georgia]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]] and singer. She is known for her role as [[Macy Alexander Sharpe|Macy Alexander Forrester Chambers Sharpe]] on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' (1989â2000, 2001, 2002â2003, 2011) and for her role as [[Krystal Carey|Krystal Carey Chandler Martin Hayward]] on ''[[All My Children]]'' (2003â2011).

==Biography==
=== Personal life ===
She is the youngest of five daughters in an Air Force family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bobbieeakes.com/biography.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Eakes was [[Miss Georgia]] 1982, and studied at the [[University of Georgia]]. She married novelist and actor David Steen on July 4, 1992.

===Career===
Eakes received bit roles on nighttime television series, such as ''[[Cheers]]'', before becoming successful in the soap opera genre. In the mid-1980s, she was the lead singer of the dance-pop group Big Trouble. The group released one self-titled CD in 1987, which was produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giorgio-moroder-disco.com/moroderlp1986-1990.html Giorgio Moroder discography, 1986-1990]&lt;/ref&gt; Their single &quot;Crazy World&quot; charted on the U.S. singles chart, reaching #71.

She first achieved fame in the role of [[Macy Alexander]] on the [[soap opera]] ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', which she played from 1989 to 2000 (on contract),  2001 (guest appearance), 2002 to 2003 (on contract), and 2011(on contract). A very popular &quot;good girl&quot; kind of character, Macy battled with her inner demons (including an addiction to [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]) before finally finding happiness with Deacon Sharpe (played by [[Sean Kanan]]. On the show, Macy was an accomplished singer in her own right (in tune with Bobbie Eakes' hobby). Eakes is slated to return to the role as Macy in October 2011 for a unknown peroid of time. Eakes returned to the role in November 2011.

Between stints as Macy, Eakes hosted shows on the country music television channel [[Great American Country]]. She was also featured on country music singer [[Collin Raye]]'s 2000 single &quot;Tired of Loving This Way&quot;, which peaked at #50 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts.

On July 7, 2000, her character &quot;died&quot; in a fiery explosion when her car crashed into a gasoline truck when the writers of the show felt the character of Macy no longer contributed to the show's storyline. She was brought back to the show during the ''B&amp;B'' location shoot at [[Portofino]], [[Italy]] in December 2002, and was then killed off after a chandelier fell on her during a concert in 2003. The decision was made to kill Macy off a second time after Eakes had decided to take the role of [[Krystal Carey]] on ''[[All My Children]]'', as the complete opposite of Macy,playing the sexy and sassy character. The role of Krystal is loosely based on Eakes' [[U.S. South|Southern]] upbringing.

Eakes also starred in productions of ''[[Cinderella]]'' and ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]'' opposite her former costar [[Jeff Trachta]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The two are still friends offscreen.  The CD they recorded together, &quot;Bold and Beautiful Duets&quot;, went double-platinum in Europe.

With All My Children airing it's final episode on ABC in September 2011, in June 2011 it was highly rumored that Bobbie Eakes would be returning to ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. Eakes guest starred in a cameo appearance as Macy on [[The Bold and the Beautiful]] for one episode.
