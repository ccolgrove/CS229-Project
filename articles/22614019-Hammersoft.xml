The '''2009â10 Celtic League''' (known as the '''2009â10 Magners League''' for sponsorship reasons) was the ninth [[Celtic League (rugby union)|Celtic League]] season and the fourth with [[Magners]] as title sponsor. The season began in September 2009 and ended with the Grand Final on 29 May 2010. Ten teams played each other on a home-and-away basis, with teams earning four points for a win, two points for a draw and a bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match. The losing team may also earn a bonus point if they lose by seven points or less. 

The ten teams competing consisted of the four Irish provinces, [[Munster Rugby|Munster]], [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]], [[Connacht Rugby|Connacht]] and [[Ulster Rugby|Ulster]]; two Scottish regions, [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and [[Glasgow Warriors]]; and four Welsh regions, [[Cardiff Blues]], [[Newport Gwent Dragons]], [[Ospreys (rugby team)|Ospreys]] and [[Scarlets]].

This season saw the introduction of a play-off structure similar to the [[Guinness Premiership]] in order to determine the overall winner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/my_club/leinster/8054405.stm BBC Sport]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/7341673.stm BBC Sport]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ospreys (rugby team)|Ospreys]] won the final, defeating [[Leinster Rugby|Leinster]] in [[RDS Arena|Dublin]] 17â12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/welsh/8713104.stm|title=Leinster 12â17 Ospreys|date=2010-05-29|work=[[BBC Sport]]|first=Richard|last=Petrie|accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
