An '''image viewer''' or '''image browser''' is a [[computer program]] that can display stored graphical [[image]]; it can often handle various [[graphics file format]]s. Such software usually renders the image according to properties of the display such as [[color depth]], [[display resolution]], and [[color profile]].

Although you may use a full-featured [[bitmap graphics editor]] (such as [[Photoshop]] or the [[GIMP]]) as an image viewer, these have many editing functionalities which are not needed for just viewing images, and therefore usually start rather slowly. Also, most viewers have functionalities that editors usually lack, such as stepping through all the images in a directory (possibly as a slideshow).

Image viewers give maximal flexibility to the user by providing a direct view of the directory structure available on a hard disk.  Most image viewers do not provide any kind of automatic organization of pictures and therefore the burden remains on the user to create and maintain their folder structure (using tag- or folder-based methods). However, some image viewers also have features for organizing images, especially an image database, and hence can also be used as [[image organizer]]s.

Some image viewers, such as [[Windows Photo Viewer]] that comes with Windows operating systems, change a jpeg image if it is rotated, resulting in loss of image quality; others offer losseless rotation. 

Typical features of image viewers are:
* basic viewing operations such as zooming and rotation
* fullscreen display
* [[slideshow]]
* [[thumbnail]] display
* printing
* screen capture

Advanced features are:
* decode next image in advance and keep previous decoded image in memory for fast image changes
* display (and edit) [[metadata]] such as [[XMP]], [[IPTC Information Interchange Model]] and [[Exif]]
* batch conversion (image format, image dimensions, etc.) and renaming
* create [[contact sheet]]s
* create [[HTML]] thumbnail pages
* different transition effects for slideshows

Common image viewers include:
* Windows
** [[Windows Explorer]] - [[file manager]] with basic built-in functionality for image viewing
** [[Windows Picture and Fax Viewer]]
** [[ACDSee]], [[FastStone Image Viewer]], [[FastPictureViewer]], [[Imagine_(graphics_software)|Imagine]], [[IrfanView]], [[Media Pro 1]], [[XnView]]
* UNIX-like
** [[Gwenview]], [[XnView]], [[xv]], xloadimage,  [[KuickShow]], [[GThumb]], [[Eye of GNOME]]
* Web-based
** AJAX-ZOOM Gallery [http://www.ajax-zoom.com AJAX-ZOOM Gallery]
