<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="277025" ns="0" title="Pig (zodiac)"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''Pig''' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:è±¬|è±¬]]|s=[[wikt:çª|çª]]}}), is the last of the 12 animals which appear in the [[Chinese zodiac]]. The '''Year of the [[Pig]]''' is associated with the [[Earthly Branches|earthly branch]] '''Hai''' ('''[[wiktionary:äº¥|äº¥]]''').

In Chinese culture, the pig is associated with fertility and virility. To bear children in the Year of the Pig is considered to be very fortunate, for they will be happy and honest.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent report that this belief is still widely held in China, see Edward Cody, &quot;Oh, to be Born in the Year of the Pig,&quot; ''Washington Post'' (March 1, 2007).[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/28/AR2007022802104.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the continuous [[sexagenary cycle]], every twelfth year corresponds to ''Hai'', and is commonly called &quot;the Year of the Pig&quot; or &quot;the Year of the Boar&quot; (è±¬å¹´). There are five types of Pig, named after the [[Chinese elements]]. In Japanese culture, the animal is specifically a [[wild boar]]. In Japanese, the character [[wiktionary:è±|è±]] is pig and the character [[wiktionary:è±¬|è±¬]] denotes the wild boar, though Chinese does not make such a differentiation.
