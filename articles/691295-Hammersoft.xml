The '''Coupe Charles Simon''', commonly known as the '''Coupe de France''' ({{IPA-fr|kup dÉ fÊÉÌs}}, ''French Cup''), is the premier [[Single-elimination tournament|knockout]] cup competition in [[French football]] organized by the [[French Football Federation]]. The cup competition is named after Charles Simon, a French [[sportsman]] who died while serving in World War I and is open to all amateur and professional [[Association football|football]] clubs in France, including clubs based in the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]]. The final is played at the [[Stade de France]] and the winner of the Coupe de France qualifies for the playoff round of the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The current champions are [[Lille OSC|Lille]], who defeated [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] 1â0 in [[2011 Coupe de France Final|the final]] of the [[2010â11 Coupe de France|2010â11 competition]]. 

The Coupe de France was first held in [[Coupe de France Final 1918|1917â18]] and, during the [[Coupe de France 2007â08|2007â08 season]], celebrated its 90th anniversary. Combined with random draws and one-off matches (no replays), the Coupe de France can be difficult for the bigger clubs to win. The competition is usually beneficial to the amateur clubs as it forces higher-ranked clubs, usually professional clubs, to play as the away team when drawn against lower-league opposition if they are competing two levels below them. However, despite the advantages, only one amateur club has actually reached the final since [[professionalism]] was introduced in [[French football]] in 1932: [[Calais RUFC]] in [[Coupe de France Final 2000|2000]]. Both clubs who have won the competition and were not playing in [[Ligue 1]] were professional, [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] in [[Coupe de France Final 1959|1959]] and [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]] in [[Coupe de France Final 2009|2009]]. The Coupe de France is managed and ran by the Coupe de France Commission, whose president is former [[France national football team|French international]] [[Jean Djorkaeff]].

7,422 clubs participated in the [[2011â12 Coupe de France|2011â12 cup competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=La Coupe de France fÃªte sa rentrÃ©e |url=http://www.fff.fr/cfra/actu/539183_la-coupe-de-france-fete-sa-rentree |work=[[French Football Federation]] |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2011 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:CA Paris - Le Havre 1920.jpg|thumb|200px|right|1920 final between [[CA Paris]] and [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]]]]
The Coupe de France was created on 15 January 1917 by the ''French Interfederal Committee'' (CFI), an early predecessor of the [[French Football Federation]]. The idea was pushed by the federation's general secretary [[Henri Delaunay]] and under ''[[union sacrÃ©e]]'', the competition was declared open to all clubs, amateur and professional, though [[professionalism]] in [[French football]] at the time was non-existent. The major clubs in France objected to the notion that all clubs should be allowed to enter and preferred the model of the [[FA Cup]] in England, which limited the competition to only the country's ''elite''. However, the federation dispelled their complaints and declared the competition would remain as is. Due to the minimal requirements to enter, the first competition featured 48 clubs. By 1948, the number had increased to 1,000 and at present, the competition features more than 7,000 clubs. Due to the initial increase in clubs, the federation created preliminary rounds beginning with the 1919â20 season. The following season, they added a second preliminary round. As of today, the competition contains eight regional rounds with some [[Regions of France|regions]] containing as much as ten.

The first Coupe de France victors were [[Olympique de Pantin]] who defeated [[FC Lyon]] 3â0 at the Stade de la LÃ©gion Saint-Michel in Paris in front of 2,000 spectators. The following year, the competition was shifted to the [[Parc des Princes]] and drew 10,000 supporters to the final that saw CASG Paris defeat [[Olympique de Paris]] 3â2. The competition alternated between many stadiums during its early years playing at the [[Stade Pershing]] from 1920â1924 before switching to the [[Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir]] in [[Colombes]]. The competition lasted a decade there before returning to the Parc des Princes in 1938. In 1941, the final was held at the [[Stade de Paris]]. The following year, the final returned to Colombes and remained there until moving to the Parc des Princes permanently following its renovation, which made it the largest in terms of attendance in France.

Since the ratio between amateur and professional clubs in France is extremely one-sided, the competition regularly produces surprises. The best performance by an amateur club in the competition is usually awarded the ''Petit Poucet Plaque''. On 4 February 1957, one of the competition's biggest upsets occurred when Algerian club [[JS El Biar|SCU El Biar]] defeated [[UEFA|European]] powerhouse [[Stade de Reims]] who had players such as [[Robert Jonquet]], [[Michel Hidalgo]], [[LÃ©on Glovacki]], and [[Just Fontaine]] in its arsenal. One of the more recent successes of an amateur club occurred during the [[Coupe de France 1999-2000|1999â2000 competition]] when [[Championnat de France amateur]] club [[Calais RUFC]] reached [[Coupe de France Final 2000|the final]]. Calais, composed of doctors, dock workers, and office clerks, started the competition in the 5th round and, after defeating fellow amateurs, reached the Round of 64 where they faced [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. Calais, after 120 minutes, were level 1â1 with Lille and defeated their Northern foes 7â6 on [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]]. In the following two rounds, Calais defeated Langon-Castets and [[AS Cannes|Cannes]]. In the quarter-finals, Calais defeated [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] 2â1 and on 12 April 2000, eclipsed [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] 3â1 in the semi-finals to advance to the final. Calais' road to the final was a prime example of the major advantages amateur clubs had with the club playing all of its matches at home beginning with the Round of 64 match. Unfortunately for Calais, their ''[[Cinderella]]'' run came to an end in the final with the club losing to [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] 2â1 despite scoring first.

Professional clubs have continued to express their displeasure with the advantages amateur clubs receive in the competition with many of their complaints being directly associated with their hosting of matches. Coupe de France rules explicitly state that teams drawn first during the draw are granted hosting duties for the round, however, if the club drawn second is competing two levels below the club drawn first, then the hosting duties will be given to the second club drawn. Many clubs have subsequently complained that, due to the amateur clubs not having adequate funds, the stadiums they play in are extremely unkempt. The resulting differences led to the clubs represented by the [[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] forming their own cup competition, the [[Coupe de la Ligue]]. More recently, amateur clubs have begun to move to more established stadiums for their Coupe de France matches with their primary reason being to earned more money at the gate due to more established stadiums having the ability to carry more spectators.

The winner of the Coupe de France trophy normally holds onto the trophy for one year to put in on display at their headquarters before returning it to the French Football Federation. In the early 1980s, the cup was stolen, but was retrieved by the authorities quickly. Since 1927, the [[President of France]] has always attended the cup final and presented the trophy to the winning team's [[Captain (association football)|captain]]. President [[Gaston Doumergue]] was the first French president to take part in the ceremony.

==Competition format==
Similar to other countries cup competitions, the Coupe de France is a [[knockout tournament]] with pairings for each round drawn at random. Each tie is played through a single leg. If a match ends in a draw, extra time is played and if the match is still drawn, penalties are held. Prior to 1967, the competition had no [[extra time]] nor [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootouts]] and instead allowed replays, similar to the [[FA Cup]]. This style was abandoned following three straight draws between [[Olympique Lyonnais]] and amateur club [[AngoulÃªme CFC]], which resulted in the federation [[Coin toss|flipping a coin]] to decide which club advanced. For the [[Coupe de France 1968â69|1968â69 season]], extra time was introduced and, two years later, the penalty shootout was instituted. Following the [[Coupe de France 1974â75|1974â75 season]], replays were scrapped.

There are a total of 14 rounds in the competition. However, rounds in the competition are determined through each [[Regions of France|region in France]] with one of the main reasons being to reduce travel costs. Depending on the region, the number of rounds may vary from four to as many as eight with each region sending a set number of clubs to the 7th round. The regions conduct rounds of matches up until the 7th round when professional clubs enter the competition. All of the clubs are then split and drawn against each other randomly, regardless of regional affiliation. In the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]], territories such as [[Guadeloupe]], Martinique, [[French Guyana]], and [[RÃ©union]] establish their own knockout competition, similar to the regions in France, though only one club from each region is allowed to enter. Territories like [[Mayotte]], [[French Polynesia]], and [[New Caledonia]] allow the winner of their cup competitions to enter the 7th round, such as when [[AS Mont-Dore]] won the 2009 edition of the [[New Caledonia Cup]] to earn qualification for the 2009â10 Coupe de France.

As well as being presented with the trophy, the winning team also qualifies for the [[UEFA Europa League]]. If the winner has already qualified for the UEFA Champions League via the league, the UEFA Europa League place goes to the cup runners-up. If they have also qualified for the UEFA Champions League, the place goes to the next highest placed finisher in the league table.

==Numbering==
In Coupe de France matches, players are restricted to wearing the shirt numbers 1â18 regardless of the player's traditional number. The starters are given the numbers 1â11 with each player given a certain number [[Squad_number (association football)#First use of numbers|based on his position]]. However, if a player wears a number between 1â11 domestically, he is allowed to wear that same number in Coupe de France matches unless he is among the substitutes at the start of the match, in which case the number is given to the player that is playing in his position.

==Sponsorship==
The Coupe de France does not have a primary sponsor of the competition, but allows sponsors of the [[French Football Federation]] to showcase themselves on club's kits. Among them include [[SFR]], [[Groupe Caisse d'Epargne|Caisse d'Epargne]], [[CrÃ©dit Agricole]], [[Sita (waste management)|Sita-Suez]], and [[Carrefour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspromedia.com/deals/_a/fff_gets_sponsorship_boost_as_pmu_comes_on_board/ FFF gets sponsorship boost as PMU comes on board]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
[[File:FÃªte Coupe de France, 6 mai 2006.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] celebrating their 7th Coupe de France title.]]
[[Olympique de Marseille]] have the honor of having won the most Coupe de France titles, winning ten, with their most recent coming during the [[Coupe de France 1988â89|1988â89 season]] following their 4â3 victory over [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]]. Marseille also have appeared in the most finals having played in 18. Marseille are notable in terms of losing in the competition as they are one of four clubs who have suffered two consecutive finals defeat with the [[Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne|southern coast]] club losing to [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in [[Coupe de France Final 2006|2006]] and falling to [[FC Sochaux-MontbÃ©liard|Sochaux]] the [[Coupe de France Final 2007|following season]]. Marseille are the only club of the four to lose consecutive Coupe de France finals twice. Paris Saint-Germain are second behind Marseille having won seven Coupe de France titles. The Parisian club are also the only club to have won [[The double#Domestic Cup Double|both the Coupe de France and the Coupe de la Ligue]] in the same season having accomplished this in 1995 and 1998. Many clubs have won the [[The Double|league and cup double]], the most recent being [[Olympique Lyonnais]] who completed their double after defeating Paris Saint-Germain 1â0 in the [[Coupe de France Final 2008|2008 final]].

Due to the early dominance of Parisian clubs during the early run of the competition and along with PSG's consistency, the [[Ãle-de-France (region)|Ãle-de-France]] region has the most Coupe de France champions having produced 23. The region is followed by [[Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur]] with Marseille being the region's most successful club.

Managers [[Guy Roux]] and [[AndrÃ© Cheuva]] share the honor of having managed four Coupe de France winning clubs. The most successful players are [[Dominique Bathenay]], [[Alain Roche]], and [[Marceau Sommerlynck]] who all won five titles. [[Ãric PÃ©cout]] of Nantes and [[Jean-Pierre Papin]] are joint top-scorers of the competition final having each converted a [[hat trick]] in their only appearances in the ultimate match. In 1947, Roger Vandooren scored the fastest goal in final's history converting after 29 seconds for his club [[Lille OSC|Lille]] in their 2â0 win over [[RC Strasbourg|Strasbourg]].

==Media coverage==
The Coupe de France currently has a broadcasting agreement with [[France TÃ©lÃ©visions]], the French public national television broadcaster, and [[Eurosport]].
