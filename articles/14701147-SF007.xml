'''''Les TrophÃ©es du Libre''''' contest is a [[free software]] contest whose goal is to promote innovative software projects and give these projects recognition and media coverage - recently also to motivate students and academic institutions with special prizes. The competition is international and it is intended both to free development professionals and amateurs. Participating projects can apply for seven categories: Security, Games, Multimedia, Business Management, Education, Science applications and administration and communities.

The first edition (2003) had 113 applying projects from 18 different countries.
