'''Marisol Valles GarcÃ­a''' (born 1989, [[Ciudad JuÃ¡rez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], Mexico) is the former police chief of [[PrÃ¡xedis G. Guerrero Municipality|Praxedis G. Guerrero]] located in the northern Mexican state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] near the cities of [[Ciudad JuÃ¡rez]] and [[Guadalupe Municipality, Chihuahua|Guadalupe]].&lt;ref name=Lundin /&gt; In March 2011, she was dismissed from her post after failing to show up for work. Valles and her family apparently have fled to the United States where they are currently seeking asylum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yapp&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexican Student Police Chief Will Live in Fear for Rest of Life |first=Yapp |last=Robin |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/8554971/Mexican-student-police-chief-will-live-in-fear-for-rest-of-life.html  |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Since Mexican President [[Felipe CalderÃ³n]] declared war on [[drug cartels]] in 2006, the country's death toll related to drug crime has been around 30,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=More Than 30,000 Killed in Mexico's Drug Violence |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/12/16/killed-mexicos-drug-violence/ |publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] |date=16 December 2010 |accessdate=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayors and police have been specifically targeted; some beheaded, some tortured to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lundin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=A Fistful of Valor |first=Leigh |last=Lundin |url=http://criminalbrief.com/?p=14303 |work=Crime News |publisher=Criminal Brief |date=24 October 2010 |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early October 2010, [[TancÃ­taro]]'s mayor Gustavo SÃ¡nchez was found beaten to death with his hands tied behind his back.  Elected in January, he'd stated &quot;The fear is always there, but if you have courage and a desire to make a contribution, that outweighs the fear&quot;.

==Praxedis G. Guerrero valley==
Prior to the war on drugs, rural [[PrÃ¡xedis G. Guerrero, Chihuahua|Praxedis G. Guerrero, Chihuahua]] was a quiet town. Two rival drug gangs, the [[JuÃ¡rez Cartel]] and the [[Sinaloa Cartel]], now fight for control of the region's main highway, making Chihuahua one of the most dangerous places in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lundin&quot; /&gt; Residents hide in houses from fear of violence and death. In nearby Ciudad JuÃ¡rez in October 2010, a gang killed over a dozen people, including children, at a birthday party. Several police officers in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez have been abducted or killed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brice&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=20-year-old woman becomes top cop in violent Mexican municipality |first=Arthur |last=Brice |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/10/20/mexico.female.police.chief/?hpt=C1 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=20 October 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Praxedis G. Guerrero's previous chief, Manuel Castro, had been tortured and beheaded a year earlier.

===Search for a police chief===
With all but three police officers having quit, mayor JosÃ© Luis Guerrero desperately sought solutions. After a year without a police chief, 20-year-old Marisol Valles Garcia, who was a student working on a degree in [[criminology]] at the [[University of Guadalajara]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lundin&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jazeera&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexican student made police chief |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/americas/2010/10/2010102152617810551.html |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=21 October 2010 |accessdate=21 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the only person willing to accept the job.  She was sworn in on 18 October 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico's newest police chief?

The district has 9,148 inhabitants, and a police force of nineteen.
