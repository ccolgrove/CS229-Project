==History==
===Early years===
In February 1937, against the backdrop of the [[Great Depression]], George Pepperdine founded the university as a Christian liberal arts college in the city of Los Angeles. On September 21, 1937, 167 new students from 22 different states and two other countries entered classes on a newly built campus on {{convert|34|acre|ha}} at West 79th Street and South Vermont Avenue in the Vermont Knolls neighborhood of [[South Central Los Angeles]],&lt;ref name=Ebony&gt;Aldore Collier, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n2_v45/ai_8153049 FaithDome: &quot;A grand-slam homer for Jesus.&quot;], ''Ebony'', December 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to later as the Vermont Avenue campus.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Jahn, [http://gsep.pepperdine.edu/alumni/colleaguemagazine/spring2006/35thAnniversary.htm GSEP 35th Anniversary: A Celebratory Evening to Remember], ''Colleague Alumni Magazine'', Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Graphic111402&gt;Tracy Domingo, [http://graphic.pepperdine.edu/news/2002/2002-11-14-miracle.htm Miracle at Malibu Materialized], ''Graphic'', November 14, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  By April 6, 1938, George Pepperdine College was fully accredited by the Northwest Association.

Pepperdine had built a fortune founding and developing the [[Western Auto|Western Auto Supply Company]], which he started with a $5 investment, but his prosperity led to his greater ambition to discover &quot;how humanity can be helped most with the means entrusted to [his] care. [He] consider it wrong to build up a great fortune and use it selfishly.&quot; Mr. Pepperdine voiced his twofold objective for the college that bore his name, &quot;First, we want to provide first-class, fully accredited academic training in the liberal arts&amp;nbsp;... Secondly, we are especially dedicated to a greater goalâthat of building in the student a Christ-like life, a love for the church, and a passion for the souls of mankind.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

===Move to Malibu===
By the 1960s, the young college faced serious problems. The area around the Vermont Avenue campus developed issues with crime and urban decay; tensions also arose due to the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] and attempts to circumvent it such as [[California Proposition 14 (1963)|California Proposition 14]], which challenged federal [[fair housing]] laws.&lt;ref name=Graphic111402 /&gt;  The situation exploded in the 1965 [[Watts Riots]].&lt;ref name=Graphic111402 /&gt;  In 1969 activists in the Watts area threatened to burn down the campus; however, they were talked out of it after all-night negotiations by then-President M. Norvel Young.&lt;ref name=Graphic111402 /&gt;  In addition, the Vermont Avenue campus was running out of room to expand.&lt;ref name=Graphic111402 /&gt;

In 1967, the school put forth a multi-campus idea that would move the undergraduate campus to an alternative location; a committee formed and looked at numerous locations, including sites in [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] and [[Westlake Village]].&lt;ref name=Graphic111402 /&gt;  Pepperdine favored the Westlake Village location until the Adamson-Rindge family, who owned hundreds of acres in Malibu, offered {{convert|138|acre|ha}} of Malibu land; despite concerns over building costs on the mountainous site, the school decided to move forward based on its prime location and potential for raising donation.&lt;ref name=Graphic111402 /&gt;  On April 13, 1971, the university broke ground to commence construction and in September 1972 the Malibu campus opened for student enrollment.&lt;ref name=Graphic111402 /&gt;

(The old Pepperdine University campus was sold to [[Crenshaw Christian Center]], whose pastor, Frederick K.C. Price, then oversaw construction of the &quot;FaithDome,&quot; the largest domed-church in the United States, seating over 10,000).

====School of Law====
{{Main|Pepperdine University School of Law}}
Pepperdine gained university status in 1971 when the [[Pepperdine University School of Law|school of law]] was added and the business and education departments became separate schools. In the 1980s, Pepperdine rose to prominence as one of the United States' leading centers of [[conservatism|conservative]] politics, attracting many conservative-leaning professors from nearby [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and [[University of Southern California|USC]]. Prominent conservatives on the Pepperdine faculty have included [[Bruce Herschensohn]], [[Ben Stein]], [[Kenneth Starr]], [[Arthur Laffer]], [[Douglas Kmiec]], and [[Daniel Pipes]].
[[Image:Pepperdinefire.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Smoke billows on a hill near Pepperdine University's Theme Tower.]]

====Brushfires====
In 1993 and 1996, massive brushfires threatened the campus with destruction, but firefighters succeeded in protecting almost all structures. On October 21, 2007, fast-moving wildfires forced campus residents to relocate and shelter in the Firestone Field house and Cafeteria, plus evacuations of local homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press according to CNN&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another November 2007 fire in Corral Canyon, accidentally set off by a group of Los Angeles youths, caused an evacuation of the Drescher Campus.  However, most students were off-campus for the Thanksgiving holiday.

==Campus==
The main campus is located among several ridges that overlook the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Coast Highway (US)|Pacific Coast Highway]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], California. The main campus entrance road ascends a steep, well-groomed grassy slope past a huge stylized cross, known as the Phillips Theme Tower, symbolizing the university's dedication to its original Christian mission. Most buildings were constructed in a typical 1980s-style reinterpretation of classic Californian and [[Mediterranean Revival Style architecture|Mediterranean architecture]] (red tile roofs, white stuccoed walls, large tinted windows). There are views of the Pacific Ocean, [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]], [[Palos Verdes|Palos Verdes Peninsula]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the westside of Los Angeles from numerous points. Graduations take place at Alumni Park, a broad expanse of lawn overlooking Pacific Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean. The main academic plaza for undergraduate programs of Seaver College lies just above Alumni Park and includes Stauffer Chapel, Tyler Campus Center, Payson Library, and the Ahmanson Fine Arts Center. Undergraduate housing and athletic facilities sit to the north/northwest of the academic complex. The Law School exists even higher above these areas. The central campus is surrounded by a loop road consisting of Seaver Drive, Huntsinger Circle, and John Tyler Drive. Banowsky Boulevard separates Alumni Park from the main academic complex and is named in honor of William S. Banowsky, the 4th president of Pepperdine.

Spur roads to the east of the central part of campus lead to faculty housing. To the northwest, Via Pacifica winds uphill to the '''Drescher Graduate Campus''', completed in 2003 and home to the School of Public Policy, the Villa Graziadio conference center, as well as the fulltime programs of the Graziadio School of Business and Management and the Graduate School of Education and Psychology. Housing for graduate students, undergraduate honors students, and faculty are also located here.

{{main|Pepperdine Waves}}
[[Image:Pepperdine logo.png|thumb|130px|right|Pepperdine Waves Logo]]
Pepperdine University participates in the [[West Coast Conference]], a conference made up exclusively of religiously affiliated schools. Appropriate for its location adjacent to the Pacific Ocean, Pepperdine's teams are known as the Waves.

Pepperdine University was recently ranked by the [[NACDA Director's Cup|Sears Cup]] as having the most successful athletic program for non-[[American football|football]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] schools. ([[Stanford]] was ranked the most successful Division I athletic program with football.) Pepperdine University sponsors fourteen [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I intercollegiate athletics teams: baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, tennis, volleyball and water polo teams for men; and basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming, tennis and volleyball for women. There are also a number of intercollegiate sports clubs such as men's soccer, men's and women's lacrosse, surf team, Ultimate Frisbee and men's rugby.

Pepperdine's Men's [[rugby football|Rugby]] Team, despite the small size of the school, has enjoyed great success since it was first initiated in 1955.  The recently storied 2010-2011 season is one their best seasons.  Under the helm of [[Robert Joseph Ahola]], the team went undefeated in the fall pre-season and established itself as a contender for the national tournament.  During the spring cup season, The Waves lost only one controversial match to [[Cal State Fullerton]], whom they had beaten earlier to become the 2011 Southern California Division 2 Champions.  The team qualified for the national championships tournament in San Diego where they beat the top D2 school from [[Texas]] and nationally 9th ranked [[Rice University]] in the sweet 16.  Despite not winning the national championship, The Waves finished among the top 8 at nationals--a first for the historic Rugby club.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goff|first=Alex|title=Eight Left in DII Men College|url=http://rugbymag.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=532:eight-left-in-dii-men-college&amp;catid=51:mens-dii-college-&amp;Itemid=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;
