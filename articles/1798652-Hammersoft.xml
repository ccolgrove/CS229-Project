'''''Tiger Woods PGA TOUR''''' is a series of [[video games]] developed and published by [[Electronic Arts]] featuring professional golfer [[Tiger Woods]], among other pros on the [[PGA Tour]].

Although most games in the series have been developed internally at EA studios, some SKUs have come from outside developers including the very first one, '' Tiger Woods PGA TOUR'99,'' which was developed by Adrenalin Entertainment in conjunction with EA for the PS1, and ''Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2001'' for the PS1, which was developed by [[Stormfront Studios]].

A mobile version of the game (''Tiger Woods PGA TOUR Golf'') first appeared in 2002, developed by [[IOMO]] and published by Digital Bridges under licence from EA. Two more iterations ''Tiger Woods PGA TOUR Golf 2004'' and ''Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2005'' were also developed by [[IOMO]]. 

A more arcade-style golf game called [[CyberTiger]] was released for the PlayStation (1),
