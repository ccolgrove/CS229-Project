The '''2011 Lebanese protests''' have been seen as influenced by the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://af.reuters.com/article/egyptNews/idAFLDE71Q08L20110227 | work=Reuters | title=Lebanese protest against sectarian political system | date=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main protests focused on calls for political reform especially against [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessionalism]] in [[Lebanon]].

== Background ==
=== Political system ===
[[Lebanon]] is a [[parliamentary republic]] within the overall framework of [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessionalism]], a form of [[consociationalism]] in which the highest offices are proportionately reserved for representatives from certain religious communities. The [[Constitution of Lebanon|constitution]] grants the people the right to change their government, however, from the mid-1970s until the parliamentary elections in 1992, a [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]] precluded the exercise of political rights. According to the constitution, direct elections must be held for the parliament every 4 years. The last parliamentary [[Lebanese general election, 2009|election]] was in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/pro-western-coalition-declares-victory-in-lebanon/article1172689/ Pro-Western coalition declares victory in Lebanon - The Globe and Mail]&lt;/ref&gt; which led to about six months before a new government was formed. The [[Parliament of Lebanon|parliament]], in turn, elects a [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|president]] every 6 years to a single term, he is, however, not eligible for re-election. The last presidential [[Lebanese presidential election, 2008|election]] was in 2008. The president and parliament choose the [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|prime minister]]. [[List of political parties in Lebanon|Political parties]] are grouped with either the [[March 8 alliance]] or the [[March 14 alliance]]. (the [[Progressive Socialist Party]] of [[Walid Jumblatt]] is ostensibly independent but leans towards March 8 since their withdrawal from the then governing March 14).

Lebanon [[Demographics of Lebanon|demographics]] is roughly split amongst [[Sunni]]s, [[Shia]]s and [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christians]] (most of whom are [[Maronite]]). Due to the demographic concerns, amid fears the country could be a [[powder keg]], a [[census]] has not been carried out since 1932. Since then the government has only published rough estimates of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.country-studies.com/lebanon/population.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 new government ===
{{main|Lebanese government of November 2009}}
On January 12, 2011, the government collapsed after Energy Minister [[Gebran Bassil]] announced that all ten opposition ministers had resigned following months of warnings by Hezbollah that it would not remain inactive should there be indictments against the group by the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]] in the assassination of former Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC collapse&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Hezbollah and allies topple Lebanese unity government|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12170608|accessdate=12 January 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary indictments were issued January 17 as expected,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011115181151959973.html Hariri indictments set for Monday - Middle East - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) President [[Michel Suleiman]]'s appointed Minister of State, [[Adnan Sayyed Hussein]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT collapse&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakri|first=Nada|title=Resignations Deepen Crisis for Lebanon|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/world/middleeast/13lebanon.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1|accessdate=12 January 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; resigned later bringing the total number of ministers who quit to 11 thus causing the fall of the government. The ''New York Times'' suggested that the resignations came after the collapse of talks between Syria and Saudi Arabia to ease tensions in Lebanon. The resignations stemmed from PM Hariri's refusal to call an emergency cabinet session over discussion for withdrawing cooperation with the STL.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/01/14/stories/2011011467772400.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Lebanese government falls | date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011117171436837590.html US welcomes Hariri indictment - Middle East - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suleiman, who is constitutionally responsible for the formation of a new government, accepted the resignations saying: &quot;In line with clause one of article 69 in the [[Constitution of Lebanon|Lebanese constitution]] on the circumstances under which the government is considered to have resigned...as the government has lost more than one third of its members...the cabinet [is requested to] act as a caretaker government until the formation of a new government.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;almanarreactions2&quot;&gt;&quot;http://www.almanar.com.lb/newssite/NewsDetails.aspx?id=169956&amp;language=en&lt;/ref&gt; The March 8 alliance then nominate [[Najib Mikati]] to form a government in line with the accepted norms that a prime minister must be a Sunni (even though most Sunnis are supporters of March 14).

On 13 June, a new government was [[Lebanese government of June 2011|formed]].

The cabinet acceded to these demands,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lebanonews.net/mainhl.asp?hlid=8156&lt;/ref&gt; and the marches were &quot;suspended.

== Spillover from Syria ==
