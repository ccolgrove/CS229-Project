'''Occupy Baltimore''' is a [[peaceful protest]] and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]] that began on October 4, 2011 in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], in [[McKeldin Square]] near the [[Inner Harbor]] area of [[Downtown Baltimore]]. It is one of the many [[Occupy movement]]s around the United States and worldwide, inspired by [[Occupy Wall Street]].

Toward the end of October, the city stated that the wanted to scale back the protest. They wanted to limit the hours the protesters were at the site, the number of tents at the site, and the amount of space at the site the protesters were using. The concern was that the site was being used as a campground, which is was not supposed to be, and each case would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9QK21580.htm Occupy Baltimore: City wants scaled-back presence - BusinessWeek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the group has been determined to keep their protest alive, not letting the city's decision to cut off power stop them, and planning to winterize their tents for the cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reisterstown.patch.com/articles/occupy-baltimore-one-month-later-565eec2d Occupy Baltimore, One Month Later - Reisterstown, MD Patch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 17, 2011, protesters marched on the [[Howard Street Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Origin==
The occupation of McKeldin Square began on October 4, 2011. This came after a meeting held on October 2 by 150 people at a different location. Those holding the meeting requested that a [[Baltimore Sun]] reporter leave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-10-02/news/bs-md-occupy-baltimore-20111002_1_protests-spread-peaceful-march-planning-meeting Occupy Baltimore planning meeting draws about 150 - Baltimore Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Messages==
Organizers from the beginning did not have a single ideology.&lt;ref name=WBALTV29416249/&gt; Various messages have been voiced by protesters. These include:
*Shortages of jobs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/money/29420985/detail.html|title=Protesters Send Gov. O'Malley Job Message|date=October 10, 2011|publisher=WBAL-TV|language=English|accessdate=1 December 2011|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Legality===
On October 25, [[Baltimore City Hall|City Hall]] declared the encampment was illegal on the basis that McKeldin Square is not a campground. The city stated that anyone is free to protest at the location, but not to camp overnight. Mayor [[Stephanie Rawlings-Blake]] said each illegal act would be handled on a &quot;case-by-case basis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-10-26/news/bs-md-occupy-permit-20111025_1_city-designated-protest-site-robert-brune-overnight-camping Occupy Baltimore: City Hall declares protesters' camping illegal - Baltimore Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the city stated that they wanted to avoid a violent confrontation.&lt;ref name=ACLU&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-10-26/news/bs-md-occupy-follow-20111026_1_arrest-protesters-baltimore-mayor-stephanie-rawlings-blake-camping|title=Rawlings-Blake wants to avoid 'violent exchange' with protesters|last=Broadwater|first=Luke|date=October 26, 2011|work=Baltimore Sun|language=English|accessdate=1 December 2011|location=Baltimore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ACLU]] has defended the movement is constitutionally protected free speech.&lt;ref name=ACLU/&gt;

Toward the end of November, the movement applied for a 6-month permit to occupy McKeldin Square and to set up 4 large and up to 40 personal tents. The city denied the permit on the basis that permits are not issued for more than 5 days or 150 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/news/29896802/detail.html|title=Occupy Baltimore's Permit Extension Denied|date=December 1, 2011|publisher=WBAL-TV|language=Baltimore|accessdate=1 December 2011|location=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rape and robbery allegations===
On Friday, October 28, a woman claimed she had been sexually assaulted in her tent and robbed of $1800 cash. She said she could not go home because the attackers had taken her bills and knew where she lived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/emotional-interview-alleged-occupy-baltimore-rape-victim-says-activists-refused-to-help/ Raped and Robbed Occupy Baltimore Woman Receives No Help From âActivistsâ | Video | TheBlaze.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A 38-year-old man was taken into custody, though no evidence of a sexual assault was found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbaltv.com/news/29644386/detail.html Woman Robbed Of $1,800 At Occupy Baltimore - Baltimore, Maryland News Story - WBAL Baltimore&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cutting off of power===
On November 2, the city cut off power to the occupiers at McKeldin Square, citing safety concerns. The protesters had been using the electrical outlets at the square for their basic needs, including heating food and charging cell phones and laptops. The protesters said this would not stop them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbaltv.com/news/29666560/detail.html City Cuts Off Power At Occupy Baltimore Site - Baltimore, Maryland News Story - WBAL Baltimore&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters have responded by setting up [[solar panel]]s and are also attempting to set up a bicycle that can generate electrical power.

===Concert cancellation===
Protesters blamed [[Baltimore Police]] for forcing the cancellation of a November 12 concert by the band [[Celebration (band)|Celebration]]. The concert was cancelled over safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/music/midnight-sun-blog/bal-occupy-baltimore-blames-baltimore-police-for-canceled-celebration-concert-20111115,0,4747048.story Occupy Baltimore blames Baltimore police for canceled Celebration concert - baltimoresun.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disruption of Karl Rove===
On November 15, protesters interrupted a speech given by [[Karl Rove]] on the [[Johns Hopkins University]] campus. They stated that Rove had &quot;occupied&quot; [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan War|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/16/karl-rove-occupy-baltimore_n_1097872.html|title=Karl Rove Gets 'Mic Checked' By Occupy Baltimore At Otherwise Dull-Sounding Symposium|work=Huffimgton Post|language=English|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
