Numerous real-world aircraft have appeared in [[fiction]] over the decades, including in books, films, toys, TV programs, video games and other media. These appearances spotlight the popularity of different models of aircraft, and showcase the different models for the general public.

The years between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] saw extensive use of the new technology, aircraft, in the new medium, film.&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1920s Hollywood studios made dozens of now-obscure 'aerial Westerns' with leads such as [[Tom Mix]] and [[Hoot Gibson]], where the role of the horse was taken by aircraft, or used aircraft as nothing more than vehicles for stunts to excite audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1926 the first 'proper' aviation film was made; ''[[Wings (film)|Wings]]'' is a story of two pilots who sign up to fly and fight in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; Made with the co-operation of the then-[[United States Department of War|Department of War]] (a relationship that continues to this day), it used front-line military aircraft of the day such as the [[Thomas-Morse MB-3]] and [[Boeing Model 15|Boeing PW-9]], flown by military pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;aerofiles&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://aerofiles.net/film-u.html |title= List of aviation films (U to Z)  |last= aerofiles.com |first= |authorlink= |year= |accessdate= 2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Future United States Air Force Generals [[Henry H. Arnold|Hap Arnold]] and [[Hoyt Vandenberg]] were among the military officers involved with the production, Arnold as a technical consultant and Vandenberg as one of the pilots.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcmWings&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=504086&amp;category=Notes |title= ''Wings'' (1927) - notes on the production |accessdate= 2010-01-17 |last= Turner Classic Movies |authorlink= |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wings'' was a box-office hit when it achieved general release in 1929 and went on the win the award for Best Production at the first [[Academy Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oscars&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmsite.org/bestpics3.html |title= List of Academy Award winners for Best Picture |last= filmsite.org |authorlink= |year= 2009 |accessdate= 2010-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] in the 1930s, aviation-themed films were used as [[propaganda]] tools to complement the massed flights led by [[Italo Balbo]] in promoting the regime domestically and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;W109&quot;&gt;Wohl, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  One such film was the most successful Italian film of the pre-World War II era. ''Luciano Serra pilota'' (''Luciano Serra, pilot'') was inextricably linked to the Fascist government via [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] son [[Vittorio Mussolini|Vittorio]], who was the driving force behind the film's production.&lt;ref name=&quot;W109&quot;/&gt; The film, set between the year 1921 and the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italo-Abyssinian War]], was used to compare the allegedly-moribund state of aviation in pre-Fascist Italy with the purported power of the [[Regia Aeronautica]] and Italian aviation in general in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, pp. 109-112&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the time that ''Luciano Serra pilota'' was shown at the 1938 [[Venice Film Festival]], the link between aviation and Fascism had already been firmly established in the minds of the Italian people through widespread depictions of aircraft in a variety of media.&lt;ref name=&quot;W109&quot;/&gt; For example there was an entire branch of the [[Futurism|Futurist Art movement]] devoted to aviation, known as ''[[Aeropittura]]'' (Aeropainting).&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborn&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |title= Tullio Crali: the Ultimate Futurist Aeropainter (simultaneita.net) |accessdate= 2010-01-17 |last= Osborn |first= Bob |authorlink= |year= undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the ''Aeropittura'' works were devoted to flight rather than aircraft ''per se'', some did celebrate Italian aviation exploits, such as Alfredo Ambrosi's ''Il volo su Vienna'' (''The Flight over Vienna'') which depicted in Futurist style the [[Flight over Vienna|World War I exploit]] of [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]; although the city of Vienna is shown in abstract in accordance with the aims of ''Aeropittura'' - namely to show the dynamism and excitement of flight - the [[Ansaldo SVA]] aircraft are very carefully and accurately rendered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osborn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohl, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==F-15 Eagle==
The [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] is one of the most recognized modern fighters; this has led to, or perhaps even been aided by, its common use in children's toys. The Transformers toy line and media has featured numerous characters who turn into F-15 Eagles, the most notable being the villain [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] in 1984&lt;ref name=&quot;Time30Jul01&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000438,00.html |title= Action Figures From The '80s |accessdate= 2009-12-09 |last= Briese |first= Beau |authorlink= |year= 2001 |month= July |work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of similar Decepticons, the [[Seekers (Transformers)|Seekers]] [[Acid Storm]], [[Thundercracker]], [[Skywarp]] and [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]].

The ads were withdrawn when it came to the attention of New Line Cinema that the F-15, which first flew in 1972, was out of place for a movie set in 1962. This was problematic for New Line, who had termed the film a &quot;by-the-numbers recreation&quot; and &quot;close to perfect.&quot; &quot;Every ship, plane, truck and craft that moves in the film is absolutely authentic to the time period,&quot; said Steve Elzer, a spokesman for New Line.

==F-22 Raptor==
The [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] has been featured in numerous books, such as [[Tom Clancy]]'s ''[[Debt of Honor]]'' in which a lengthy mission by F-22s dominates the last part of the book;&lt;ref name=&quot;Debt of Honor&quot;/&gt; and [[Clive Cussler]]'s ''[[Dark Watch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cussler, Clive. ''Dark Watch''. New York: Berkley Books, 2005. ISBN 0-425-20559-2&lt;/ref&gt; In Cussler's book, an F-22 embarks on a secret mission to take out a Syrian foe.

The Raptor has appeared in films as well. Despite appearing in the 2003 ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' film, the F-22 made its major Hollywood debut in the 2007 film ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' and its [[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|sequel]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Miles&quot;&gt;Miles, Donna.

Toys released for Starscream were replica F-22 Raptor models. These models were reused for other characters in the line, like [[Thundercracker]], [[Skywarp]] and [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], that also turned into F-22 Raptors.&lt;ref name=&quot;HasbroInst2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/83757.pdf |title= Claw Slash Ramjet |accessdate= 2009-12-09 |last= [[Hasbro]] |authorlink= |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the live-action 2007 Transformers film made Starscream the most well known Transformer that turns into an F-22, there were other F-22 Transformers before it. For instance the 1997 ''[[Machine Wars]]'' versions of [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and Megaplex transformed into F-22s.&lt;ref name=&quot;MachineWarsVandom&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eyrie.org/~dvandom/BW/MW/index.html |title= Transformers Machine Wars |accessdate= 2010-01-04 |last= Vandom |first= D |authorlink= |year= 1997 |month= April}}&lt;/ref&gt;
