'''Calcium chloride''', CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a [[Salt (chemistry)|salt]] of [[calcium]] and [[chlorine]].  It behaves as a typical [[ion]]ic [[halide]], and is [[solid]] at [[room temperature]]. Common applications include  [[brine]] for refrigeration plants, [[ice]] and dust control on roads, and [[desiccation]]. Because of its [[hygroscopic]] nature, anhydrous calcium chloride must be kept in tightly-sealed air-tight containers.

==Properties==
Calcium chloride can serve as a source of calcium [[ions]] in a [[solution]] as calcium chloride is [[soluble]]. This property can be useful for displacing ions from solution. For example, [[phosphate]] is displaced from solution by calcium:

: 3 CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 2 K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) â Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + 6 KCl (aq)

Molten calcium chloride can be [[electrolysis|electrolysed]] to give [[calcium]] metal and [[chlorine]] gas:

: CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (l) â Ca (s) + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Calcium chloride has a very high [[enthalpy change of solution]]. 

The anhydrous salt is [[Deliquescent#Deliquescence|deliquescent]]; it can accumulate enough water in its [[crystal lattice]] to form a solution.

==Preparation==
Calcium chloride can be produced directly from [[limestone]], but large amounts are also produced as a by-product of the [[Solvay process]]. North American consumption in 2002 was 1,687,000 tons (3.7 billion pounds).&lt;ref&gt;Calcium Chloride SIDS Initial Assessment Profile, UNEP Publications, SIAM 15, Boston, October 22â25, 2002, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
A Dow Chemical Company manufacturing facility in Michigan, houses about 35% of the total U.S. production capacity for calcium chloride.&lt;ref&gt;Calcium Chloride Chemical Profile, The Innovation Group, www.the-innovation-group.com, printed September 9, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Calcium chloride occurs  as the rare [[evaporite]] minerals sinjarite (dihydrate) and  antarcticite (hexahydrate). A related mineral [[chlorocalcite]] (potassium calcium chloride, KCaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also very rare.

==Uses==
===Desiccant ===
[[Drying tube]]s are frequently packed with calcium chloride. [[Kelp]] is dried with calcium chloride for use producing [[sodium carbonate]]. Adding solid calcium chloride to liquids can remove dissolved water. Calcium chloride is also used in products such as [[DampRid]] and [[Dri-Z-Air]] which is advertised as an air moisture absorber.  Anhydrous calcium chloride has been approved by the FDA as a packaging aid to ensure dryness (CPG 7117.02).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

These [[hygroscopic]] properties are also applied to keep a liquid layer on the surface of the roadway, which holds dust down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Deicing and freezing point depression===
By [[Freezing-point depression|depressing the freezing-point]] calcium chloride is used to  prevent ice formation and to [[deicing|deice]]. This is particularly useful on road surfaces. Calcium chloride dissolution is exothermic, and is relatively harmless to plants and soil; however, recent observations in Washington state suggest it may be particularly harsh on roadside evergreen trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When distributed for this use, it usually takes the form of small white balls a few millimeters in diameter, called [[prills]]. Solutions of calcium chloride can prevent freezing at temperature as low as â52&amp;nbsp;Â°C (â62&amp;nbsp;Â°F), making it ideal for filling agricultural implement tires as a liquid ballast, aiding traction in cold climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Source of calcium ions===
Calcium chloride is used to increase the [[Hard water|hardness]] in swimming pools. This reduces the erosion of the concrete in the pool. By [[Le Chatelier's principle]] and the [[common ion effect]], increasing the concentration of calcium in the water will reduce the dissolution of calcium compounds essential to the structure of concrete. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In [[marine aquarium]]s calcium chloride is added to introduce [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] calcium for calcium carbonate shelled animals such as [[mollusks]] and [[cnidarians]]. [[Calcium hydroxide]] (kalkwasser mix) or a [[calcium reactor]] can also be used to introduce calcium, however calcium chloride addition is the fastest method and has minimal impact on [[pH]].

===Food===
As an ingredient, it is listed as a permitted food additive in the European Union for use as a [[sequestrant]] and [[firming agent]] with the [[E number]] E509,
and considered as [[generally recognized as safe|generally recognized as safe (GRAS)]] by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;ref&gt;21 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] Â§ 184.1193&lt;/ref&gt;
The average intake of calcium chloride as food additives has been estimated to be 160â345&amp;nbsp;mg/day for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Calcium Chloride SIDS Initial Assessment Profile, UNEP Publications, SIAM 15, Boston, October 22â25, 2002, pages 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[firming agent]] calcium chloride is used in canned vegetables, in firming [[soy bean]] curds into [[tofu]] and in producing a [[caviar]] [[spherification|substitute from vegetable or fruit juices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | month = April | year = 2004

 | accessdate = 9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used as an [[electrolyte]] in sports drinks and other beverages  including [[GlacÃ©au|Smartwater]] and [[Nestle]] bottled water. The extremely salty taste of calcium chloride is used to flavor [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] while not increasing the food's [[sodium]] content. Calcium chloride's freezing-point depression properties are used, for example, in [[Cadbury Caramilk]] chocolate bars to slow the freezing of the caramel. 

In [[brewing]] beer, calcium chloride is sometimes used to correct mineral deficiencies in the brewing water. It affects flavor and chemical reactions during the brewing process, and can also affect yeast function during fermentation. Calcium chloride is sometimes added to processed milk to restore the natural balance between calcium and protein in [[casein]] for the purposes of making cheese such as [[brie (cheese)|brie]], [[PÃ©lardon]] and [[stilton (cheese)|stilton]].

===Medicine===
Calcium chloride can be injected as [[intravenous therapy]] for the treatment of [[hypocalcaemia]]. It can be used for magnesium intoxication. Calcium chloride injection may antagonize cardiac toxicity as measured by [[electrocardiogram]].
It can help to protect the myocardium from dangerously high levels of serum [[potassium]] in [[hyperkalemia]]. Calcium chloride can be used to quickly treat Calcium Channel Blocker toxicity, from the side effects of drugs such as [[Cardizem]] â helping avoid potential heart attacks.

Aqueous calcium chloride is used in genetic [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] of cells by increasing the cell membrane permeability, inducing [[competence (biology)|competence]] for DNA uptake (allowing DNA fragments to enter the cell more readily).

===Other===
Calcium chloride is used in concrete mixes to help speed up the initial setting, but chloride ion leads to corrosion of steel [[rebar]], so it should not be used in [[reinforced concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Building Research Institute|publisher=National Academy of Science-National Research Council|pages=24â5|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium chloride is used in swimming pool water as a pH buffer and to adjust the calcium hardness of the water. 

Calcium chloride is included as an additive in plastics and in [[fire extinguisher]]s, in wastewater treatment as a drainage aid, in [[blast furnace]]s as an additive to control scaffolding (clumping and adhesion of materials that prevent the furnace charge from descending), and in [[fabric softener]] as a thinner.

The exothermic dissolution of calcium chloride is used in [[self-heating cans]] and [[heating pad]]s.

In the oil industry calcium chloride is used to increase the density of solids free brines. It is also used to provide inhibition of swelling clays in the water phase of invert emulsion drilling fluids.

==Toxicology==
Calcium chloride can act as an [[irritation|irritant]] by desiccating moist skin. Solid calcium chloride dissolves [[exothermic reaction|exothermically]] and [[Burn (injury)|burns]] can result in the [[mouth]] and [[esophagus]] if calcium chloride is ingested. Ingestion of concentrated solutions or solid calcium chloride products may cause gastrointestinal irritation or ulceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dow.com/productsafety/finder/cacl_2.htm | title = Product Safety Assessment (PSA): Calcium Chloride | publisher = [[Dow Chemical Company]] | date = May 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
