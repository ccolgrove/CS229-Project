The '''Titanic Museum Attraction''' is a permanent two-story museum shaped like the [[RMS Titanic]] itself. It is located on Country Highway 76, [[Branson, Missouri]] and  built half-scale to the original. The museum holds 400 pre-discovery artifacts in twenty galleries.

The structure is anchored in water to create the illusion of Titanic at sea, and the 90-minute, self-guided tour is designed to give guests the sensation of being an original passenger on Titanicâs 1912 maiden voyage.

As guests step through the artificial iceberg into the world of the Titanic, they are given a passenger boarding ticket. On this ticket is the name of an actual Titanic passenger and the class they were traveling. Guests will learn the individual stories of several passengers. In the Titanic Memorial Room, they will find out whether their ticketed passenger survived or perished. 

Titanic attraction opened in 2006.
