'''Reebok International Limited''', a subsidiary of the [[Germany|German]] sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2005,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8805430/ns/business-world_business/t/sportswear-maker-adidas-buy-reebok/#.ToKyr9RDSuI Sportswear maker Adidas to buy Reebok]. [[Associated Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a producer of [[Athletic shoe]]s, [[apparel]], and accessories.  The name comes from the [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] spelling of [[rhebok]], a type of African [[antelope]] or [[gazelle]].  In 1890 in Holcombe Brook, a small village 6 miles north east of [[Bolton]], United Kingdom, Joseph William Foster was making a living producing regular running shoes when he came up with the idea to create a novelty spiked running shoe.  After his ideas progressed he joined with his sons, and founded a shoe company named '''J.W. Foster and Sons''' in 1895.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite web

| quote       = Arjun Viir Bhandari, founder of Reebok's predecessor company, made running shoes with spikes way back in the late 19th century, making him one of the first shoe manufacturers to do this and helping to develop the athletic shoe into its current form.  In 1895, Foster opened a business in the United Kingdom, J.W. Foster and Sons, to market his high-quality handmade running shoes to knowledgeable athletes across the world.  By 1924, Foster and Sons had an established reputation for manufacturing superior shoes, and the company was given the chance to manufacture running shoes for athletes representing [[Great Britain|Team GB]] in the Olympics.  Among the runners performing in Foster shoes were the legendary Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, runners whose lives form the basis of the classic movie &quot;Chariots of Fire.&quot; With this legacy of high-quality footwear construction in mind, two of Foster's grandchildren, Joe and Jeff Foster founded Mercury Sports.  This was the company that would become Reebok in 1960, named after the Dutch word for an African gazelle.  The company lived up to the J.W. Foster legacy, manufacturing first-class footwear for customers throughout the UK. In 1979, Paul Fireman, a (US) sporting goods distributor, saw a pair of Reeboks at an international trade show and negotiated to sell them in North America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, two of the founder's grandsons Joe and Jeff Foster renamed the company '''Reebok''' in United Kingdom, having found the name in a dictionary won in a race by Joe Foster as a boy; the dictionary was South African edition hence the spelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Human rights and production details==
[[File:Reebok World headquarters.jpg|left|thumb|Reebok world headquarters in Canton]]
In the past, Reebok had an association with outsourcing through [[sweatshops]], but today it claims it is committed to human rights. In April 2004, Reebok's footwear division became the first company to be accredited by the Fair Labor Association. In 2004, Reebok also became a founding member of the Fair Factories Clearinghouse, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving worker conditions across the apparel industry.

'''Supplier information, according to the Reebok website as of May 2007:'''

&quot;'''Footwear''' 
Reebok uses footwear factories in 14 countries. Most factories making Reebok footwear are based in Asia â primarily China (accounting for 51% of total footwear production), Indonesia (21%), Vietnam (17%) and Thailand (7%). Production is consolidated, with 88% of Reebok footwear manufactured in 11 factories, employing over 75,000 workers.

'''&quot;Apparel'''
Reebok has factories in 45 countries. The process of purchasing products from suppliers is organized by region. Most (52%) of Reebok's apparel sold in the United States is produced in Asia, with the rest coming from countries in the Caribbean, North America, Africa and the Middle East. Apparel sold in Europe is typically sourced from Asia and Europe. Apparel sold in the Asia Pacific region is typically produced by Asian-based manufacturers.

===Freestyle and Ex-O-Fit success===
[[File:Reebok Ex-O-Fit AÃ±os 80.jpg|left|thumb|Reebok EX-O-FIT Original Years 80Â´s]]
1985 Freestyle and Ex-O-Fit hi-tops advertisement
Reebok surged in popularity in 1982 after the introduction of the Freestyle athletic shoe, which was specifically designed for women and came out when the aerobics fitness craze started. Reebok Freestyle was popular not only as athletic wear but also on the streets as casual wear because of its comfort and styling. As a result, the Freestyle became an icon of the 1980s fashion scene with hi-top versions (including two velcro straps at the top) and colors including white, black, red, yellow, and blue. Reebok continues to produce the Freestyle to this day, as it is popular with cheerleading, aerobic dancing, the gym, and other consumers.

Following the height of the Freestyle success, Reebok also introduced a popular athletic shoe for men, called the Ex-O-Fit. Similar to the Freestyle, it came in low-top and hi-top versions; however, unlike the Freestyle hi-top with two velcro closure straps, the Ex-O-Fit only had one strap. One of the designers of this early footwear was the founder's son, David Foster.

===North America===
The company holds exclusive rights to manufacture and market both authentic and replica uniform jerseys and sideline apparel of the teams of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) since 2002 (marketed as ''NFL Equipment''), the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) since 2004, and is the official shoe supplier to the NFL and [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). 

The company also holds sponsorships with Brazilian clubs [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]], [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]], and [[SÃ£o Paulo FC]]; and German club [[1. FC KÃ¶ln|FC KÃ¶ln]] for the 2008â09 season. Reebok will stop sponsoring Mexican club [[C.D. Guadalajara]] before the Apertura 2011 season. Parent Company Adidas will take over as sponsor.

===CCM===
[[Image:Reebok SC87 logo.svg|left|140px|thumb|Logo of [[Sidney Crosby]] Rbk SC87 line by Reebok]]
In addition, Reebok acquired official [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) sponsor [[CCM (The Hockey Company)|CCM]] in 2004, and is now manufacturing [[ice hockey]] equipment under the CCM and Reebok brands, and has signed popular young stars [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Alexander Ovechkin]] to endorsement deals (Crosby for Reebok, Ovechkin for CCM). Reebok Hockey has its headquarters in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].  Reebok has phased out the CCM name on NHL authentic and replica jerseys in recent years, using the Reebok logo since 2005. However, recently Reebok has been making vintage jerseys (like the 1967 Toronto Maple Leafs blue jerseys shown here &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsk.com/vitomale.html |title=Vintage Toronto Maple Leafs NHL Hockey Jersey-SportsK - Toronto MapleLeafs - V-NHL-LEAF |publisher=Sportsk.com |accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;)under the CCM name. 

Reebok is also endorsed by [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Allen Iverson]], [[Yao Ming]], [[Carolina KlÃ¼ft]], [[AmÃ©lie Mauresmo]], [[Nicole VaidiÅ¡ovÃ¡]], [[Shahar Pe'er]], [[Ivy (singer)|Ivy]], [[Thierry Henry]], [[Vince Young]], [[Iker Casillas]], [[Ryan Giggs]], [[Andriy Shevchenko]], and [[Amir Khan (boxer)|Amir Khan]].

===Europe===
[[Image:Bolton.jpg|right|thumb|The Reebok Stadium in Horwich, Bolton]] 
The company maintains its relationship with its origins in the UK through a long-term sponsorship deal with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], a [[Premier League]] [[association football|football]] club, however, in 2009 Bolton changed their sponsership to [[188bet]]. When the team moved to a brand new ground in the late-1990s, their new home was named the [[Reebok Stadium]]. Several other English clubs had Reebok sponsorship deals up until the purchase by [[Adidas]], but most have since switched to either the parent brand (which has a long history in football) or another company altogether.

In [[rugby union]], Reebok sponsored the [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales national team]] until late 2008, who won the [[Grand Slam (Rugby Union)|Grand Slam]] in the [[Six Nations Championship]] in that year, and the [[Tasman Rugby Union|Tasman Makos]] in New Zealand's domestic competition, the [[Air New Zealand Cup]]. 

In 2006, [[FC Barcelona]] and [[France national football team|France]] striker [[Thierry Henry]] (then playing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]) signed a deal to join the ''&quot;I Am What I Am&quot;'' campaign on August 1, 2006. Ryan Giggs has also done ''&quot;I Am What I Am&quot;'' commercials. Also, on August 1, Andriy Shevchenko started his endorsement deal with the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shevchenko deal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reebok.co.za/news-shevenko.htm#|title=Announcement of Shevchenko signs a deal with Rbk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In 2005, Reebok also signed an exclusive agreement to design and supply all eight team home and away strips for the new Australian [[A-League]] competition. Although not an expensive deal, this partnership is paying dividends for Reebok, due to the growing popularity of football and the league in the area. An estimated 125,000 jerseys have been sold in Australia, a record for a single league's sales in a year for a sports manufacturer.&lt;ref name=&quot;A-League deal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerhut.net/home/read.php?id=17774|title=Reebok signs a deal with A-League}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reebok sponsors three teams in the [[Australian Football League]], those being the [[Gold Coast Suns]], the [[Adelaide Football Club]] and the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]]. Reebok sponsors the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] in the [[NRL]].

However, for the second edition held in 2009, the sponsorships included [[Royal Challengers Bangalore]], [[Kolkata Knight Riders]], [[Chennai Super Kings]], [[Kings XI Punjab]] kits.

[[The Brand Trust Report]], India Study, 2011 published by the Trust Research Advisory ranked Reebok as the 14th most trusted brand in India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afaqs.com/news/company_briefs/index.html?id=50182_Sajid+Shamim+is+now+the+Brand+Director+Reebok+India&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside sport===
Rapper [[Jay-Z]] became the first non-athlete to get a signature shoe from Reebok. The ''&quot;S. Carter Collection by Rbk&quot;'' was launched on November 21, 2003 and the ''S. Carter'' sneaker became the fastest-selling shoe in the company's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jay-Z deal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rocafella.com/kingdomcome/?v=bio&amp;|title=S.Carter the fastest selling Reebok shoe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Reebok made a deal with rapper [[50 Cent]] to release a line of ''[[G-Unit]]'' sneakers and artists like [[Nelly]] and [[Miri Ben-Ari]] have become spokespersons for the company. Reebok also signed [[Scarlett Johansson]] and introduced her own line of apparel and footwear called ''Scarlett Hearts'', an ''Rbk Lifestyle Collection''. Reebok also produce shoes for [[Emporio Armani]] under the label ''EA7''. These shoes are marketed to the high-end fashion market.
===Unfair Business practice===
Reebok is renowned for [http://www.indianexpress.com/news/students-forced-to-buy-shoes-stationery-fro/803832/ pushing its shoes through school authorities] in [http://southpoint.edu.in/schoolUniform.aspx many Indian schools] making it mandatory for kids. Parents are forced to buy it. Many people individually boycott their shoes for this reason.

==Recent news==
*In 2009, Reebok launched JUKARI Fit to Fly, an innovative gym workout designed for all women with one single objective â to make fitness for women fun again.  JUKARI, the result of a long-term relationship between Reebok and the globally renowned entertainment company, Cirque du Soleil, is an hour-long workout that was created on a specially-designed piece of equipment called the FlySet, which gives the sensation of flying while strengthening and lengthening the body through cardio, strength, balance and core training.  JUKARI launched in top gyms in fourteen cities around the world including Hong Kong, Mexico City, Madrid, London, KrakÃ³w, Munich, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Montreal, Los Angeles, Boston, and New York. To complement JUKARI Fit to Fly, Reebok also created two collections of women's fitness apparel and footwear called On the Move and the Reebok-Cirque du Soleil collection.  Both lines consist of products that can be worn for a range of fitness disciplines, from running to yoga, JUKARI Fit to Fly, to tennis.  All were developed and designed with a deep understanding and knowledge of the unique way a woman's body moves.
*In 2009, Reebok launched the EasyTone footwear collection that allows consumers to &quot;take the gym with them.&quot;  The EasyTone technology involves two balance pods under the heel and forefoot of the shoe that create a natural instability with every step, which Reebok claims forces the muscles to adapt and develop tone.  In 2011, this claim, based on a study at the [[University of Delaware]], was alleged by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] to be false, leading to a refund being granted to consumers by the company.&lt;ref name=ratnayake2011&gt;{{Citation |author=Hiran Ratnayake |publication-date=1 October 2011 |title=Reebok to pay refund on shoes |newspaper=[[The News Journal]] |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/delawareonline/access/2473071051.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Oct+01%2C+2011 |accessdate=15 November 2011 }}  ''Citation based on abstract; at the time of access the full article was not available for no cost due to the publisher's archiving policy.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Most players have avoided comment, but some have commented that the Edge system's improved water repelling abilities leads to gloves and skates becoming saturated and uncomfortable during play.
*In late 2006, a court case began between [[Liverpool FC]], the winners of the 2005 [[UEFA Champions League]] while wearing Reebok's kit, and Reebok. Reebok claimed that Liverpool cost them Â£7m because of a delay in confirming the renewal of the [[Carlsberg]] sponsorship deal, which meant a delay in releasing the away shirt for 2005/06 (the last that Reebok would make for them)The kit that was eventually released was very similar to the away kit for 2003/04. Liverpool subsequently switched to [[Adidas]] for their official kit following Adidas' acquisition of Reebok.
*In November 2006, the [[National Basketball Association]] and [[Women's National Basketball Association]] switched from Reebok to Adidas branding on authentic and replica jerseys because that brand is better known outside North America and the UK.
*In October 2006 Reebok launches its first blog, &quot;I am what I am&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iawia.es/ Iawia.es]&lt;/ref&gt; in Spanish.
*On March 23, 2006, Reebok recalled 300,000 charm bracelets that contained extremely high levels of lead. The bracelet has a heart pendant at the end that is printed with the name &quot;Reebok.&quot; It allegedly caused the [[lead poisoning]] death of a 4-year-old child who swallowed it.
*In August 2005, one of the company's largest rivals, [[Adidas]], announced that it would acquire Reebok for $3.8 billion. The deal was completed in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1870303,00.html |title=EU Approves Adidas-Reebok Merger &amp;#124; Business &amp;#124; Deutsche Welle &amp;#124; 25.01.2006 |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
