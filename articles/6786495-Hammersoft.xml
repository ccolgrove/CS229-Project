&quot;'''Fergalicious'''&quot; is the second single from [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]]'s debut solo album, ''[[The Dutchess]]''. It features [[The Black Eyed Peas]] member [[will.i.am]], who also produced the track. &quot;Fergalicious&quot; was not officially released as the second single in the UK, although the video did receive airplay at the time. &quot;Glamorous&quot; was officially made the second single instead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fergieofficial.co.uk Fergie's official UK website.&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;Fergalicious&quot; still managed to chart at number 26 on the [[UK Official Download Chart]] and was released as the fourth single there, over a year after the song's initial release, as a [[double A-side]] with &quot;[[Clumsy (Fergie song)|Clumsy]]&quot;. This is possibly due to the huge success of &quot;[[Big Girls Don't Cry (Fergie song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]&quot; in the UK which reached #2, saved the album, and even made it reach a new peak position at #18. As of August 2008, the single has sold 3,048,000 copies. Fergie released a shoe line based on the song which is Fergalicious by Fergie.

==Composition==
The song contains an interpolation of &quot;[[Supersonic (album)|Supersonic]]&quot; by [[J.J. Fad]] and heavily samples &quot;Give It All You Got&quot; by [[Afro-Rican]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/feature/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003157589 Q&amp;A: Fergie And Will.I.Am On &quot;The Dutchess&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It also features elements from &quot;[[Night Train (song)|Night Train]]&quot; by [[James Brown]] and &quot;It's More Fun to Compute&quot; by [[Kraftwerk]] (both sampled in &quot;Give It All You Got&quot;). The riff at the opening of the song and featured throughout is from [[Dominic Frontiere]]'s theme music for the 60's TV show ''[[The Rat Patrol]]''. will.i.am's opening line is an interpolation of the opening line of [[2 Live Crew]]'s &quot;Throw the D.&quot; The word &quot;Fergalicious&quot; is a [[portmanteau]] of the words 'Fergie' and 'delicious'.  Spelling is a large part of the song's lyrics, with vocalists spelling Fergie's name, the word 'delicious', and the word 'tasty', albeit 'tastey'. Besides in the song Fergie uses three foreign words, such as &quot;tres&quot; &lt;small&gt;(Spanish number translated as &quot;three&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;, &quot;uno&quot; &lt;small&gt;(Italian &amp; Spanish number translated as &quot;one&quot;)&lt;/small&gt; and &quot;loco&quot; &lt;small&gt;(Spanish adjective translated as &quot;crazy&quot;)&lt;/small&gt;.

==Chart performance==
The song peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] several months after its release. However, &quot;Fergalicious&quot; managed to top the [[Pop 100]] chart and spent 14 weeks in the top ten of the [[Hot 100]]. &quot;Fergalicious&quot; was extremely successful as a digital song; in January 2007, it sold 295,000 downloads in a single week, holding the record for the most downloaded song in a single week (which has since been broken by [[Flo Rida]]'s &quot;[[Low (Flo Rida song)|Low]]&quot;, and songs by other artists including [[The Black Eyed Peas]]). As of August 2008, &quot;Fergalicious&quot; has been downloaded for over 2,740,000 times in the U.S. alone.

==Controversy==
The song caused controversy between Fergie and [[Nelly Furtado]] (both of which are signed to labels in the [[Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M]] division of [[Universal Music Group]]). In the lyrics, Fergie wrote: &quot;But I ain't [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]&quot;, which Furtado thought had referred to her [[Promiscuous (song)|single]]. Later, in the song &quot;[[Give It to Me (Timbaland song)#History|Give It to Me]]&quot;, Furtado wrote a verse, which she confirmed was directed at Fergie. In a possible response to Furtado, Fergie sings that if &quot;You got a problem, come say in to my face&quot;, in the music video for the remix song &quot;Impacto&quot;, by [[Daddy Yankee]].

In March 2009, former [[N.W.A]] member the [[Arabian Prince]] sued Fergie's record label over unpaid royalties for including a sample of ''[[Supersonic (album)|Supersonic]]'', a song he produced, for ''Fergalicious''. The lawsuit was filed in the New York Supreme Court, claiming that Tamika Wright, [[Jerry Heller]] and [[Ruthless Records]] owed him 20% of the royalties from the song. He also claims that the label refused him payment on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a149517/nwa-star-sues-label-over-fergie-song.html Retrieved on 2009-03-18.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music video==
[[Image:Fergalicious single video.jpg|right|thumb|Fergie on the set of the music video.]]
The video premiered on [[MTV]] on October 24, 2006 and premiered on [[Yahoo! Music]] on October 31, 2006. The [[music video]] was filmed in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], and directed by [[Fatima Robinson]], who also directed the &quot;[[My Humps]]&quot; music video. will.i.am from The Black Eyed Peas also appears in the video, which features Fergie as [[Willy Wonka]] in a candy factory called &quot;Fergieland&quot; (the factory was nameless in the original book and both film versions). The video starts with the [[Oompa Loompas]] packaging pink and purple boxes of &quot;Fergalicious&quot; candy. In the beginning of the video, Fergie sings in a field of candy canes with the Oompa Loompas. Throughout the video, she wears a tan and khaki [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|girl scout]] outfit, sports a black [[one-piece swimsuit]] while lying in a pile of candy, (often in a [[kaleidoscope]] view) works out in a colorful gym flexing her [[biceps brachii muscle|biceps]], sings in a room filled with lollipops and other candies while dressed like [[Shirley Temple]], and pops out of a cake while wearing a tiny blue swimsuit with gems encrusted on the exterior. She then starts watching two women wrestle in cake before joining them at the end of the video. Towards the end of the video, Fergie opens and then plays a few notes on a Samsung K5 MP3 Player, giving it center focus in the screen; there then follow, interspersed in the remaining frames of the videos, shots of other characters in the video either listening to the player, presenting it to the camera with a big smile, or carefully handing the player to another extra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fergalicious Samsung K5 MP3 Player | date=2007-01-15 | publisher=Sugar, Inc. | url =http://www.geeksugar.com/103468 | work =Geeksugar | pages = | accessdate = 2008-06-14 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 4, 2010 the music video for &quot;Fergalicious&quot; has been viewed over 20 million times on popular video-sharing website, YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fergalicious+fergie+music+video&amp;aq=f |title=fergalicious fergie music video |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
