They won their divisional playoff game against the Patriots at home 22â17.  They then played the [[Cleveland Browns]] in [[Cleveland]] for the AFC Championship.  The game culminated in the famous &quot;[[The Drive|Drive]]&quot;, where [[John Elway]] led a 98-yard drive for a touchdown pass to [[Mark Jackson (American football player)|Mark Jackson]] to tie the game and send it to overtime, where they won by a field goal, 23â20.
===AFC Divisional Playoff===
===AFC Championship Game===
This game is best remembered for '''[[The Drive]]''' when the Broncos drove 98 yards to tie the game with 37 seconds left in regulation, and Denver kicker [[Rich Karlis]] made the game-winning 33-yard field goal 5:38 into overtime. 

The Browns scored first when quarterback Bernie Kosar threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back Herman Fontenot at the end of an 86 yard drive. But the Broncos then scored 10 unanswered points: Karlis' 19-yard field goal and running back [[Gerald Willhite]]'s 1-yard rushing touchdown. Cleveland kicker [[Mark Moseley]]'s 29-yard field goal before halftime tied the score, 10â10. The teams exchanged punts before Kosar completed a 48-yard touchdown pass to [[Brian Brennan]] with 5:43 remaining in regulation. Elway then led his team from their own 2-yard line to tie the game on wide receiver [[Mark Jackson (American football player)|Mark Jackson]]'s 5-yard touchdown reception with 37 seconds left in regulation. Karlis' game-winning field goal in overtime capped a 60-yard drive after the Browns were forced to punt.
