=== Season overview ===

The [[1990 college football season]] marked the return of the Gators' [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning [[quarterback]] [[Steve Spurrier]] to his [[alma mater]] as the new [[head coach]] of the [[Florida Gators football]] team.&lt;ref name=carlson104126&gt;Norm Carlson, ''University of Florida Football Vault: The History of the Florida Gators'', Whitman Publishing, LLC, Atlanta, Georgia, pp. 104&amp;ndash;126 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  Before Spurrier returned to Gainesville, the Gators had never won a [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) or national football championship; before Spurrier resigned to seek a coaching position in the [[National Football League]] in January 2002, the Gators would win six SEC titles, play for two national championships, and win one in [[Florida Gators football, 1990&amp;ndash;1999#1996|1996]].&lt;ref name=carlson104126/&gt;

During Spurrier's first season, he was able to build on the strong talent recruited by departing Gators coach [[Galen Hall]], but the Gators also reaped the benefits of Spurrier's &quot;there are no excuses for losing&quot; mantra.&lt;ref name=carlson105109&gt;Carlson, ''University of Florida Football Vault'', pp. 105&amp;ndash;109.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1990 season's highlights included a confidence-building 17&amp;ndash;13 signature road win over the [[1990 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], which set the tone for the remainder of the season,&lt;ref name=carlson105109/&gt; followed by conference blowouts of the [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State Bulldogs]] (34&amp;ndash;21), [[LSU Tigers football|LSU Tigers]] (34&amp;ndash;8), fourth-ranked [[1990 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] (48&amp;ndash;7), [[1990 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]] (38&amp;ndash;7) and [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky Wildcats]] (47&amp;ndash;15).  The Gators also suffered two disappointing road losses to the fifth-ranked [[1990 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee Volunteers]] (3&amp;ndash;45) in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and the eighth-ranked [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State Seminoles]] (30&amp;ndash;45) in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].

Even as Spurrier's new &quot;fun 'n' gun&quot; offensive scheme led by quarterback [[Shane Matthews]], wide receiver [[Ernie Mills]] and tight end Kirk Kirkpatrick was breaking team scoring and yardage records, defensive coordinator [[Jim Bates (American football)|Jim Bates]] coached one of the best defensive squads in team history, including two first-team [[All-American]]s, defensive end [[Huey Richardson]] and safety Will White.&lt;ref name=carlson105109/&gt;&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide&gt;''[http://web.gatorzone.com/football/media/2011/media_guide.pdf  2011 Florida Gators Football Media Guide]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 116&amp;ndash;125 (2011).  Retrieved August 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthews finished the season with 2,952 passing yards and twenty-three touchdowns&amp;mdash;then the most passing yards in Gators history.&lt;ref name=carlson105109/&gt;

Spurrier's 1990 Florida Gators, while ineligible to win the SEC title or receive a bowl bid because of lingering NCAA probation,&lt;ref name=carlson105109/&gt; nevertheless posted a best-in-the-SEC record of 6&amp;ndash;1 and an overall record of 9&amp;ndash;2,&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt; and laid the foundation for the Gators' run of six SEC championships and a national title during the next decade.&lt;ref name=carlson104126/&gt;  They finished twelfth in the last [[AP Poll#College football|Associated Press Poll]].

Florida's first win versus Georgia since 1986. It was also the most points the Gators had ever scored and their widest margin of victory in the rivalry.

Jerry Odom: &quot;The mystique's a bunch of garbage.&quot;

Steve Spurrier: &quot;We've been saying this is a different team with different players from the ones before. Today, we proved that again.&quot;

Cal Dixon: &quot;To make up for everything that's happened here, we had to dominate them. All season long, there was always a doubt about Auburn and Georgia. Are we going to collapse against Auburn and Georgia? Well, for once, we didn't.&quot; 

&lt;ref&gt; King, Bill. &quot;Gators pound 'Dogs 38-7&quot;. ''Gainesville Sun''. 11 Nov 1990. &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season overview ===

The [[1991 college football season]] was [[Steve Spurrier]]'s second as the [[head coach]] of the [[Florida Gators football]] team.  The Gators were led by [[quarterback]] [[Shane Matthews]] and first-team [[All-American]] [[defensive tackle]] [[Brad Culpepper]].&lt;ref name=carlson107108&gt;Carlson, ''University of Florida Football Vault'', pp. 107&amp;ndash;108.&lt;/ref&gt;  The highlights of the season included dominating [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) victories over the seventeenth-ranked [[1991 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] (35&amp;ndash;0), twenty-first-ranked [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State Bulldogs]] (29&amp;ndash;7), [[1991 LSU Tigers football team|LSU Tigers]] (16&amp;ndash;0), fourth-ranked [[1991 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee Volunteers]] (35&amp;ndash;18), [[1991 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] (31&amp;ndash;10) and twenty-third-ranked [[1991 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]] (45&amp;ndash;13), a hardfought win over the [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky Wildcats]] (35&amp;ndash;26) to clinch the Gators' first officially recognized SEC championship, and an upset of the third-ranked [[1991 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]] (14&amp;ndash;9).&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;  The 1991 season also included a disappointing 38&amp;ndash;21 road loss to the seventeenth-ranked [[1991 Syracuse Orange football team|Syracuse Orangemen]] in the [[Carrier Dome]].&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;

Among the Gators' 1991 victories, the 14&amp;ndash;9 defensive upset of the Florida State Seminoles was a particularly memorable victory played in front of an overflow home crowd at [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]].  The Gators scored touchdowns on a first-quarter run by tailback [[Errict Rhett]], and a 72-yard bomb from Shane Matthews to [[wide receiver]] Harrison Houston in the third quarter, and held on to win.  Gators [[defensive end]]s [[Darren Mickell]] and Harvey Thomas kept Seminoles quarterback [[Casey Weldon]] off balance and on the run in the second half, and, in the fourth quarter, Gators [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safeties]] Will White and Del Speer combined to break up a fourth-down pass to the end zone by Weldon, thus saving the victory for Florida.

Spurrier's 1991 Florida Gators compiled the first-ever ten-win season in program history, an overall record of 10&amp;ndash;2 and a perfect SEC record of 7&amp;ndash;0.&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;  The Gators closed out their season with their first New Year's Day bowl appearance since [[1974 Florida Gators football team|1974]], a 28&amp;ndash;39 defeat by the [[1991 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame Fighting Irish]] in the [[1992 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]], and were ranked seventh in the final [[Associated Press]] Poll.&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;

=== Season overview ===

The [[1992 college football season]] was [[Steve Spurrier]]'s third as the [[Florida Gators football]] team's [[head coach]], and the wins were harder to come by as the star-studded senior classes from 1990 and 1991 had graduated.  The Gators racked up six tough [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) wins over the [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky Wildcats]] (35&amp;ndash;19), [[LSU Tigers football|LSU Tigers]] (28&amp;ndash;21), [[1992 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] (24&amp;ndash;9), seventh-ranked [[1992 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]] (26&amp;ndash;24), [[1992 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina Gamecocks]] (14&amp;ndash;9), and  [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt Commodores]] (41&amp;ndash;21).  They also suffered two crushing SEC losses to the fourteenth-ranked [[1992 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee Volunteers]] (14&amp;ndash;31) in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and the twenty-fourth-ranked [[Mississippi State Bulldogs football|Mississippi State Bulldogs]] (6&amp;ndash;30) on a Thursday night in [[Starkville, Mississippi]].

The Gators' non-conference schedule included a [[homecoming]] victory over the [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville Cardinals]] (31&amp;ndash;17), and another surprisingly difficult win over [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles]] (24&amp;ndash;20).  They closed their regular season with a road loss to the third-ranked [[1992 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]] (24&amp;ndash;45) in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].

The Gators finished their SEC schedule with a 6&amp;ndash;2 conference record, placing first among the six teams of the new SEC Eastern Division and earning a berth in the first-ever [[1992 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  Spurrier's scrappy young Gators, however, fell short against the SEC Western Division champion, the second-ranked [[1992 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] (21&amp;ndash;28).  The Crimson Tide would later defeat the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] in the [[1993 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] to win the 1992 national championship.

Spurrier's 1992 Florida Gators posted a 9&amp;ndash;4 overall record, concluding their season with a victory over the twelfth-ranked [[NC State Wolfpack football|North Carolina State Wolfpack]] (27&amp;ndash;10) in the [[Gator Bowl]], and ranking tenth in the final [[AP Poll#College football|Associated Press Poll]].&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;

=== Season overview ===

The [[1993 college football season]] was the fourth for [[Steve Spurrier]] as the [[head coach]] of the [[Florida Gators football]] team.  The players' and fans' preseason expectations for the Gators' fourth season under Spurrier were high, and some commentators began to speak openly about the possibility of the Gators making a run for the national title.

The Gators finished the regular season with a conference record of 7&amp;ndash;1, and in first place among the six teams of the SEC Eastern Division, thus earning a berth in the second [[1993 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].  The Gators were paired against the [[1993 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama Crimson Tide]] in the championship game&amp;mdash;a rematch of the [[1992 SEC Championship Game]].  The Gators defeated the Crimson Tide 28&amp;ndash;13, winning their first SEC Championship Game and their second SEC football championship in three seasons.

Spurrier's 1993 Florida Gators compiled a 10&amp;ndash;2 overall record.   Although the Gators fell short of their hopes for a national championship, the 1993 season marked the first time that they were ranked in the top ten of the [[AP Poll#College football|Associated Press Poll]] during every week of the season, and they were ranked fifth in the final AP Poll, following their 41&amp;ndash;7 [[Sugar Bowl]] victory over the [[1993 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia Mountaineers]].&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;
