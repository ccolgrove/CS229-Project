The '''University of Missouri''' ('''Mizzou,''' '''MU,''' '''University of MissouriâColumbia''' or simply '''Missouri''') a [[public university|public]] research university located in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Missouri]].  In [[1839]] the university was founded in [[Columbia, Missouri]], as the first [[public university|public]] institution of higher education west of the [[Mississippi River]].  The largest university in Missouri, MU enrolls over 33,805 students in 20 academic colleges.  The university is the flagship of the [[University of Missouri System]] which maintains campuses in [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].
MU is one of 34 public universities to be members of the [[Association of American Universities]] and the only one in Missouri.  There are more than 248,000 MU alumni living worldwide, with almost half continuing to reside in Missouri.&lt;ref name=MUfacts&gt;{{cite web| title=MU Facts| url=http://www.missouri.edu/about/mufacts.php| publisher= Curators of the University of Missouri| accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of Missouri was ranked 90th in the 2012 ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' among the national universities, up four spots from 2011. It is the highest-ranked public school in the state and second overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities |title=2012 U.S. News and World Report National University rankings |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus of the University of Missouri is {{convert|1372|acre|ha|0}} just south of [[Downtown Columbia, Missouri|Downtown Columbia]] and is maintained as a [[botanical garden]].  The historical campus is centered on [[David R. Francis Quadrangle]], a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] that is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and a number of buildings on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. In 1908, the world's first [[journalism school|school of journalism]] was founded by [[Walter Williams (journalist)|Walter Williams]] as the [[Missouri School of Journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=World's First J-School Celebrates 100 Years| url=http://www.britannica.com/bps/additionalcontent/18/33306422/Worlds-First-JSchool-Celebrates-100-Years |publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica| accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Missouri Research Reactor Center]] is the world's most powerful university research reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| authorlink = Jefferey E. Williams| title = MURR--The world's most powerful university research reactor | journal = The Journals of Nuclear Medicine | date =June 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P3-30242608.html | title=MURR--The world's most powerful university research reactor| publisher=Highbeam Research Inc. |accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of only six public universities in the United States with a school of [[University of Missouri School of Medicine|medicine]], [[veterinary medicine]], [[engineering]],  [[agriculture]], and [[law school|law]] all on one campus.  The university also owns the [[University of Missouri Health Care]] system, which operates four hospitals in [[Mid-Missouri]].

Missouri's only Division I-A athletic team is known as the [[Missouri Tigers]] and compete as members of the [[Big 12 conference]].  In 2012 Missouri will compete as members of the [[Southeastern Conference]].  The school's mascot, [[Truman the Tiger]], is named after Missourian and former U.S. president [[Harry S Truman]]. According to the [[NCAA]], the American tradition of [[Homecoming]] was established at the University in 1911; the tradition has since been adopted nationwide.

==History==
{{main|History of the University of Missouri}}

===Early years (1839-1892)===
In 1839, the Missouri Legislature passed the [[Geyer Act]] to establish funds for a state university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = History of the Board of Curators| publisher= Archives of the University of Missouri| url = http://muarchives.missouri.edu/uw-rg1b.html| accessdate = November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the first public university west of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref name=MUHistory&gt;{{cite web| title =History of the University of Missouri-Columbia| publisher= Office of Web Communications| url =http://www.missouri.edu/about/history/mu-history.phpl| accessdate = November 19, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To secure the university, the citizens of Columbia and [[Boone County, Missouri|Boone County]] pledged $117,921 in cash and land to beat out five other central Missouri counties for the location of the state university.&lt;ref name=MUHistory /&gt;  The land on which the university was eventually constructed was just south of Columbia's downtown and owned by [[James S. Rollins]]. He was later called the &quot;Father of the University.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Founding father descendant establishes slavery atonement endowment| publisher=University Development| url =http://formizzou.missouri.edu/news/mering-gift.php| accessdate = November 19, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the first public university in the [[Louisiana Purchase]], the school was shaped by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ideas about public education.&lt;ref name=SystemHistory&gt;{{cite web| title =History of the University| publisher= Curators of the University of Missouri| url =http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/about/history/| accessdate = November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862 the [[American Civil War]] forced the university to close for much of the year.&lt;ref name=MUDates&gt;{{cite web| title=Significant Dates in the History of the University of Missouri| publisher= University Archives| url =http://muarchives.missouri.edu/sigdates.html| accessdate = November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents of Columbia formed a &quot;home guard&quot; [[militia]] that became known as the &quot;Fighting Tigers of Columbia&quot;. They were given the name for their readiness to protect the city and university.  In 1890, the University's newly formed football team took the name the [[Missouri Tigers|&quot;Tigers&quot;]] after the Civil War militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Border War Rages On| publisher=Missouri Civil War Museum| url=http://www.mcwm.org/history_mizzoukansas.html| accessdate = November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Academic Hall Fire.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fire at Academic Hall, 1892]]
In 1870 the institution was granted [[land-grant college]] status under the [[Morrill Act]] of 1862.&lt;ref name=SystemHistory /&gt;  The act led to the founding of the Missouri School of Mines and Metallurgy as an off shoot of the main campus in Columbia. It developed as the present-day [[Missouri University of Science &amp; Technology]].&lt;ref name=SystemHistory /&gt; In 1888 the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station opened. This grew to encompass ten centers and research farms around Missouri.&lt;ref name=MUHistory /&gt;  By 1890 the university encompassed a [[normal college]] (for training of teachers of students through high school), engineering college, arts and science college, school of agriculture and mechanical arts. school of medicine, and school of law.&lt;ref name=MUDates /&gt;

On January 9, 1892, [[Academic Hall]], the institution's main building, burned in a fire that  completely gutted the building, leaving little more standing than six stone [[Ionic columns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=History of the Columns| publisher= University of Missouri Office of Web Communications| url =http://www.missouri.edu/about/history/columns.php| accessdate = November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the administration of [[Governor of Missouri|Missouri Governor]] [[David R. Francis]], the university was rebuilt, with additions that shaped the modern institution.

===1892-present===
[[File:CoMoMuPano.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Painting of the Red Campus soon after the construction of Jesse Hall]]
After the fire, some state residents tried to have the university moved further west to [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]]; but Columbia rallied support to keep it.  The columns were retained as a symbol of the historic campus.  Today they are surrounded by the [[David R. Francis Quadrangle|Francis Quadrangle]], the oldest part of campus. At the southern end of the quad is Academic Hall's replacement, Jesse Hall, named for Richard Jesse (the president of the university at the time of the fire). Built in 1895, Jesse Hall holds many administrative offices and Jesse Auditorium. The buildings surrounding the quad were constructed of red brick, leading to this area becoming known as [[Red Campus]]. The area was tied together in planned landscaping and walks in 1910 by [[George Kessler]] in a [[City Beautiful]] design of the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgekessler.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=43 georgekessler.org - Retrieved July 13, 2008]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mizzou Jesse.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[David R. Francis Quadrangle|Francis Quadrangle]], featuring the columns and [[Jesse Hall]]]]
To the east of the quadrangle, later buildings constructed of white limestone in 1913 and 1914 to accommodate the new academic programs became known as the White Campus. In 1908 the world's first [[journalism]] school opened at MU. It became notable for its &quot;Missouri Method&quot; of hands-on, experience-based instruction. It later established an award for &quot;Distinguished Journalism&quot;.

After World War II, the enrollment at universities around the country grew at an extraordinary pace, and MU was no exception. This was due in part to the [[G.I. Bill]], which allowed veterans to attend college with the assistance of the federal government.

In April 1923, a black janitor accused of rape, James T. Scott, was [[lynching|lynched]] to death before his trial took place.&lt;ref&gt;'Local Leaders Mark 1923 Lynching of U. of Missouri Janitor', ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', November 9, 2010 [http://chronicle.com/blogs/ticker/local-leaders-mark-1923-lynching-of-u-of-missouri-janitor/28206]&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 1935, four graduates of [[Lincoln University (Missouri)|Lincoln University]]âa [[historically black colleges and universities|traditionally black school]] about {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} away in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]]âwere denied admission to MU's graduate school. One of the students, [[Lloyd L. Gaines]], brought his case to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. On December 12, 1938, in a landmark 6â2 decision, the court ordered the State of Missouri to admit Gaines to MU's law school or provide a facility of equal stature. Gaines disappeared in [[Chicago]] on March 19, 1939, under suspicious circumstances. The University granted Gaines a posthumous honorary law degree in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/may/20060514News023.asp &quot;MU awards law degree to kin of rights pioneer&quot;] by Alan Scher Zagier, ''Columbia Daily Tribune'', May 14, 2006, retrieved on August 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Undergraduate divisions were integrated by court order in 1950, when the University was compelled to admit African Americans to courses that were not offered at Lincoln University.

==Campus==
[[Image:University of Missouri - Memorial Union.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Tower of Memorial Union]]
The grounds of the campus are designated a [[botanical garden]] by the state of Missouri. As noted above, the academic buildings are classified as two main groups: [[Red Campus]] and White Campus. Red Campus is the historical core of mostly brick academic buildings around the landmark columns of the [[David R. Francis Quadrangle]]; it includes Jesse Hall and [[Switzler Hall]]. In the early 1900s, the College of Agriculture began a period of rapid expansion in which several buildings were constructed to accommodate the growing program and student body. The new buildings, constructed in Neo-Gothic style from native Missouri [[limestone]], form the White Campus.  Its most notable building is [[Memorial Union (University of Missouri)|Memorial Union]].

During the 1990s, Red Campus was extended to the south with the creation of the Carnahan Quadrangle. Hulston Hall of the [[University of Missouri School of Law]], completed in 1988, formed the eastern border of the future quad. The Reynolds Alumni Center was completed in 1992 on the west side of the new quad. It was completed in 2002 with Cornell Hall of the [[Trulaske College of Business]] and Tiger Plaza.
[[Image:Mizzou TigerPlazaFountain.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A fountain and statue make up Tiger Plaza, located on the southern edge of the Carnahan Quadrangle.]]
While the original MU intercollegiate athletic facilities, such as [[Rollins Field]] and Rothwell Gymnasium, were located just south of the academic buildings, later expanded facilities were  constructed across Stadium Boulevard, where [[Faurot Field|Memorial Stadium]] opened in 1926. The [[Hearnes Center]] was built to the east of the stadium in 1972. In 1994, the university developed the first draft of a master plan for the campus to tie together all of Tiger athletic facilities to the south of Stadium Boulevard and add to its design. Today, the MU Sports Park includes the [[Mizzou Arena]], [[Taylor Stadium]], [[Audrey J. Walton Stadium|Walton Stadium]], Mizzou Athletics Training Complex, University Field and Devine Pavilion.  Student athletic facilities remain in the core area of campus. Rothwell Gymnasium and Brewer Fieldhouse are part of the {{convert|283579|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Student Recreation Center, which was ranked number one in the nation in 2005 by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colotime.com/pdf/University%20of%20Missouri.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus of the [[University of Missouri Health Care|University of Missouri Hospitals and Clinics]] is north of the sports complex. It includes the [[University of Missouri Hospital]] and [[Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital]]. Two of the hospitals, [[Columbia Regional Hospital]] and [[Ellis Fischel Cancer Center]], are located northeast of the main campus near I-70.

To the south of the MU Sports Park is the MU Research Park. It includes the University of Missouri Research Reactor Center, International Institute for Nano and Molecular Medicine, MU Life Science Business Incubator at Monsanto Place, and Dalton Cardiovascular Research Center. In 2005, the University of Missouri Board of Curators approved legislation to designate the South Farm of the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) as a research park. The {{convert|114|acre|ha|1|sing=on}} park, located {{convert/spell|3|mi|km|1}} southeast of the main campus on US63, is now known as Discovery Ridge Research Park. Tenants at Discovery Ridge include ABC Laboratories and the MU Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory.

The main campus is flanked to the east and west by [[MU Greek Life|Greek Life]] housing. The University of Missouri has nearly 50 national social fraternities and sororities, many of which occupy historical residences now valued in the millions of dollars. [[Beta Sigma Psi]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Zeta Phi|Beta Theta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], and [[Sigma Nu]] form a Greek Row (also called Frat Row) along College Avenue in the [[East Campus (University of Missouri)|East Campus]] area. Most of the Greek-letter organizations are located in a Greek Town, with approximately 30 Greek residences, to the north of Memorial Stadium.

MU is one of six public universities that houses a law school, medical school, and a veterinary medicine school on the same campus. In Missouri, MU is the designated [[land-grant university]] (along with [[Lincoln University (Missouri)|Lincoln University]]), the largest public research institution).  It is the only Missouri university that is both a member of the [[Association of American Universities]] and designated as a &quot;Doctoral/Research Extensive&quot; university by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]]. Only 35 universities in the nation have both such designations. The University of Missouri Research Reactor Center is the largest university reactor in the U.S.

[[Image:Jschool-quad.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Missouri School of Journalism]]]]
In 1908, the [[Missouri School of Journalism]] (known colloquially as the &quot;J-school&quot;), was founded in Columbia, claiming to be the first of its kind internationally. The French established their ''[[Ecole SupÃ©rieure de Journalisme de Paris]]'' in 1899.&lt;ref name=&quot;esj-paris.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.esj-paris.com &quot;''Ãcole supÃ©rieure de journalisme''&quot;], Official website {{fr}}, accessed 4 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The UM System owns and operates [[KOMU-TV]], the [[NBC]]/[[The CW|CW]] affiliate for Columbia and nearby [[Jefferson City]]. It is a full-fledged commercial station and a working lab for journalism students. The MU School of Journalism publishes the ''Columbia Missourian'' and ''Vox Magazine,''&lt;ref&gt;Vox Magazine: http://www.voxmagazine.com/&lt;/ref&gt; where students learn reporting, editing and design in a  newsroom managed by professional editors.  It operates the local National Public Radio Station KBIA and produces ''Radio Adelante,'' a Spanish-language radio program.

Founded in 1978 after 23 years as a unit of the School of Medicine, the School of Health Professions became an autonomous division in December 2000. The school's five departments and eight accredited academic programs have a long history, some dating to the early 1900s. It is Missouri's only state-supported school of health professions on a campus with an academic health center, and the only allied health school in the UM system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shp.missouri.edu/visitors/history.php &quot;History of the School of Health Professions&quot;], University of Missouri&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:EllisLibraryLower.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Ellis Library]], the main library of the university]]
The university maintains the second largest library collection in the State of Missouri. As of the 2006-2007 academic year, the collection held nearly 3.1 million volumes, 8.1 million microforms, 1.7 million government documents, more than 272,000 print maps, and more than 49,000 journal subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/about/facts.htm |title=Facts about the Libraries |publisher=Mulibraries.missouri.edu |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The collection is housed in [[Ellis Library]], the University Archives, and seven specialized academic libraries across campus. Most of the original collection, housed in [[Academic Hall]], was lost in the 1892 fire.

During the [[American Civil War]], Union troops used the Library as a guard room. The Union troops caused significant damage, including taking 467 volumes to build fires. The Board of Curators later sued the US Army for the destruction on campus. Settled in 1915, the suit's award was used to build the Memorial Gateway on the northern edge of Red Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muarchives.missouri.edu/libraryex.html |title=The Heart of the University: MU Libraries |publisher=Muarchives.missouri.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, construction began on a new main library, completed in 1915. It was expanded in 1935, 1958, and 1985. It was dedicated as Elmer Ellis Library on October 10, 1972, in honor of the thirteenth president of the University of Missouri. Today, the MU libraries are home to the 47th largest research collection in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mulibraries.missouri.edu/journalism/afflibraries.htm |title=JLib affiliated libraries |publisher=Mulibraries.missouri.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

â  Elmer Ellis became president of the University of Missouri System upon its creation, serving until 1966.

From its inception in 1839 until the creation of the [[University of Missouri System]] in 1963, the university in Columbia was known simply as the University of Missouri. Upon creation of the system, each university was renamed with its host city; thus, the university in Columbia became the University of MissouriâColumbia. In the proceeding decades, colloquial and verbal usage of the generic name in reference to MU continued. There were various attempts to drop Columbia from its name by students, faculty, alumni, and administrators who felt it might cause the university to be perceived as a regional institution. This change was long resisted by the UM System and the other universities on the basis of uniformity and fairness. However, after a renewed effort for &quot;name restoration&quot;, the Board of Curators voted unanimously on 29 November 2007 to allow MU to drop Columbia from its name for effectively all public purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missouri.edu/news/name-restoration.php |title=UM Curators recognize historic status of MU |publisher=Missouri.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continued use of the name University of MissouriâColumbia is not incorrect but is being phased out by MU, except as required on official internal documents within the UM System. Its use also continues to be advocated by some faculty, administration, and alumni of UMKC, UMSL, and Missouri S&amp;T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2007/Nov/20071130News002.asp |title=MU name deal ruffles some feathers| publisher=[[Columbia Daily Tribune]]| accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2007/9/21/umsl-opposes-mu-name-change/| title=UMSL opposes MU name change| publisher=The Maneater| accessdate=November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Associated Students of the University of Missouri (ASUM) is a student-run lobbying organization that represents the students' interests in the state and national capitals. ASUM's platform has included issues such as equalizing the &quot;Access Missouri&quot; grant, expanding &quot;Bright Flight&quot; funding, and giving students a vote on the Board of Curators.

The Trulaske Consulting Association was started in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trambu|first=Aamer|title=About us page|url=http://tca.students.missouri.edu/?page_id=51|work=TCA|publisher=TCA|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relatively new student organization and is open to students of all departments. However most members are MBA and undergrad business students. The association aims to increase awareness, provide exposure, and facilitate networking between students and professionals in the consulting industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trambu|first=Aamer|title=About us page|url=http://tca.students.missouri.edu/?page_id=224|work=spartymantz|publisher=TCA|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing popularity of the association has been attributed to the resources available to student members. Workshops by management consultants and case studies on strategy form an integral part of the activities organised by TCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schult|first=Michael|title=Upcoming Events|url=http://tca.students.missouri.edu/?page_id=2|work=spartymantz|publisher=TCA|accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, former basketball coach and alum [[Norm Stewart]] maintains the record for most wins on the hardcourt.

MU football games are played on [[Faurot Field]]. Built in 1926, the stadium has an official capacity of 71,004, and features a nearly {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}}. wide &quot;M&quot; behind the north end zone. Men's and women's basketball games are played at the [[Mizzou Arena]], located just south of the football stadium.

The official [[mascot]] for Missouri Tigers athletics is [[Truman the Tiger]], created on September 16, 1986. Following a campus-wide contest, Truman was named in honor of [[Harry S. Truman]], the only U.S. president from Missouri. Today, Truman the Tiger appears to cheer on the team, mingle with supporters at Mizzou athletic events as well as at pep-rallies, alumni association functions, and frequent visits to Columbia-area schools.

On November 24, 2007, the Mizzou football team played its biggest rival, [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]], at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. At that time KU was ranked #2 and MU was ranked #3 nationally. At the end of the [[Border Showdown|game]], Mizzou defeated KU, 36â28.

On December 1, 2007, the Mizzou football team lost the Big 12 Championship game in San Antonio, Texas, to Oklahoma 38â17, falling out of national title and Bowl Championship Series contention. They played in the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] January 1, 2008 at [[Dallas, Texas]] and defeated the [[Arkansas Razorbacks]] 38â7. In the final [[Associated Press]] &quot;Top 25 football poll&quot; of the 2007 season, Mizzou was ranked #4 in the country, its highest finishing position in the team's history.

On November 7, 2011, the University of Missouri announced that it would be leaving the [[Big 12 Conference]] to join the [[Southeastern Conference]] effective July 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kansas-city-news.pro/2011/11/mizzou-leaving-big-12-for-sec-july-1st.html|title=Mizzou Leaves Big 12 for SEC|date=November 7, 2011|work=Kansas City News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
===Tiger Walk and Prowl===
The Tiger Walk is held annually before the fall semester in the Quad, as welcome and orientation for new students to the University. Students can meet and also learn about school organizations, which have stations around the Quad. After hearing of the four pillars of success, students walk in procession through the quad and the The Columns toward Jesse Hall, symbolizing their entrance into the University.  Tiger Prowl is held for graduation seniors on the quad. They walk through the columns, away from Jesse Hall, to symbolize becoming alumni.

===Official song===
The university song is &quot;Old Missouri&quot;.  With lyrics written in 1895, it is sung to the tune of &quot;[[Annie Lisle]].&quot;

First Verse:&lt;br /&gt;
Old Missouri, fair Missouri&lt;br /&gt;
Dear old Varsity.&lt;br /&gt;
Ours are hearts that fondly love thee&lt;br /&gt;
Here's a health to thee.

Chorus:&lt;br /&gt;
Proud art thou in classic beauty&lt;br /&gt;
Of thy noble past&lt;br /&gt;
With thy watch words: honour, duty,&lt;br /&gt;
Thy high fame shall last!

Second verse:&lt;br /&gt;
Every student, man and maiden&lt;br /&gt;
Swells the glad refrain.&lt;br /&gt;
'Till the breezes, music laden&lt;br /&gt;
Waft it back again.  (repeat chorus)

===Homecoming===
MU is credited with founding alumni &quot;[[Homecoming]]&quot; in the US; a created tradition rapidly adopted by many colleges (which use it for fundraising) and high schools across the country. In 1911 athletic director Chester L. Brewer invited alumni to &quot;come home&quot; for the big football game against [[University of Kansas|KU]]. A spirit rally and parade were planned as part of the celebration. The [[Council for Advancement and Support of Education]] has called MU's homecoming celebration the best in the nation and a model program. It includes service elements: since 1999, the homecoming [[blood donation|blood drive]] has earned the [[Guinness Record]] as the nation's largest.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}
