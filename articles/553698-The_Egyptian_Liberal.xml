'''Al-Saadi Gaddafi''' ({{lang-ar|Ø§ÙØ³Ø§Ø¹Ø¯Ù ÙØ¹ÙØ± Ø§ÙÙØ°Ø§ÙÙ}}; born 25 May 1973), is the third son of former [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He is a [[Libya]]n businessman and former [[association football|football]] player. He was the commander of Libya's Special Forces and was involved in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/regime-fears-army-revolt-20110309-1bnw9.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Damien | last=McElroy | title=Regime fears army revolt | date=March 10, 2011|location=London|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Interpol notice]] (red notice) has been issued against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/03/04/140202.html | title=Interpol issues global alert on Gaddafi &amp; 15 others | work=Al Arabiya News | date=4 March 2011 | accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a part of his father's inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/2011227192852808945.html | title=Inside Gaddafi's inner circle | work=Al Jazeera | date=27 February 2011 | accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Football career ==
Gaddafi is known for his involvement in Libyan football. On 6 June 2000, the BBC reported that Gaddafi had signed with Maltese champions [[Birkirkara F.C.]] and would play for them in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/champions_league/779758.stm | work=BBC News | title=Gaddafi in Champions League | date=June 6, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move failed to materialize.

Libyan football was arranged to favor Saadi. One law forbade announcing the name of any football player with the exception of Saadi. Only numbers of other players were announced. Referees favored Saadi's club and security forces were used to silence protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/06/05/151899.html | title=Benghazi soccer exemplifies the battle between Arab autocrats and their detractors | work=Al-Arabiya | date=June 5, 2011 | accessdate=15 October 2011 | last=Dorsey | first=James M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/feb/23/muammar-gaddafi-madness | title=Muammar Gaddafi: method in his 'madness' | work=The Guardian | date=23 February 2011 | accessdate=15 October 2011 | last=Whitaker | first=Brian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He signed for [[Italy|Italian]] [[Serie A]] team [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] in 2003, employing [[Diego Maradona]] as his technical consultant and Canadian sprinter [[Ben Johnson (sprinter)|Ben Johnson]] as his personal trainer.&lt;ref name = BothroydGaddafi&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/columnists/duncanwhite/8855320/Jay-Bothroyd-puts-good-times-with-playboy-Saadi-Gaddafi-son-of-dead-Libya-tyrant-Colonel-Gaddafi-behind-him.html | work=The National Post | first=Duncan| last=White | title=Jay Bothroyd puts good times with playboy Saadi Gaddafi, son of dead Libya tyrant Colonel Gaddafi, behind him | date=29 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made only one substitute appearance before failing a drug test. He was formerly on the board of the Italian team [[Juventus F.C|Juventus]], of which 7.5% is owned by a Libyan consortium, but stepped down to join Perugia.

He was also captain of the [[Libya national football team]], captain of his home club in Tripoli, and president of the [[Libyan Football Federation]].&lt;ref name = natpost&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/10/29/the-ontario-man-who-helped-muammar-gaddafis-son-flee-libya/ | work=The National Post | first=Stewart | last=Bell | title=The Ontario man who helped Muammar Gaddafiâs son flee Libya | date=2011-10-29 |location=Toronto|accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi joined [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifiers [[Udinese Calcio]] in 2005â06, playing only ten minutes in an end-of-season league match against [[Cagliari Calcio]].

He joined [[U.C. Sampdoria]] during season 2006â07, without playing a single match.

== Business activities ==

In 2006, Gaddafi and the Libyan Government launched a project to create a semi-autonomous city similar to [[Hong Kong]] in Libya, stretching 40&amp;nbsp;km between [[Tripoli]] and the [[Tunisia]]n border. The proposed new city would become a high tech, banking, medical and educational center not requiring [[Visa (document)|visas]] to enter the new city. The city would have its own international airport and a major seaport. Gaddafi promised religious tolerance with both &quot;synagogues and churches&quot; and no discrimination in the new city. The new city would have &quot;Western style&quot; business laws that he thought European and American companies would find welcoming and familiar.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alsaadi-gaddafi-libya-calling-418208.html|work=The Independent|date=October 1, 2006|title=Al-Saadi Gaddafi: Libya calling|last=Owen|first=David|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi also takes great interest in the affairs of many of Libya's other business interests like [[Tamoil]], the oil refining and marketing company owned by the Libyan government.&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;

== Judicial affairs ==

In July 2010, Gaddafi was ordered by an Italian court to pay 392,000 Euros to a luxurious [[Liguria]]n hotel for an unpaid bill dating back to a month-long stay in the summer of 2007.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10601275.stm|title=Italian court tells Gaddafi son to pay huge hotel bill |work=BBC World News|date=July 10, 2010|accessdate=July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Saadi is married to the daughter of a Libyan military commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12531442 | work=BBC News | title=The Gaddafi family tree | date=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A US diplomatic cable in 2009 called Saadi the black sheep of Gaddafi's family.  It mentioned scuffles with European police, &quot;abuse of drugs and alcohol, excessive partying&quot; and &quot;profligate affairs with men and women&quot;.&lt;ref name = Tel20110929&gt;{{cite news|last=Farmer|first=Ben |date=29 September 2011|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8798089/Libya-Gaddafi-mouthpiece-caught-fleeing-dressed-as-a-woman.html|title=Libya: Gaddafi mouthpiece caught 'fleeing dressed as a woman|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saadi's bisexuality had partly prompted the arrangement of his marriage to the commander's daughter, the cable said.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Atlantic]] Wire. [http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2011/09/times-kept-qaddafis-sons-bisexuality-quiet-governments-request/42597/ New York Times Kept Qaddafi's Son's Bisexuality Quiet]. 2011-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gay pornography]] was reportedly found among Saadi's possessions when his home was ransacked by looters after the fall of Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Advocate]].''

== 2011 Libyan civil war ==
On 15 March, there were unconfirmed reports that a pilot by the name of Muhammad Mokhtar Osman attacked the Gaddafi stronghold of [[Bab al-Azizia]] in Tripoli damaging it and injuring Saadi and his brother [[Khamis Gaddafi]].

Speaking to BBC Panorama, a Libyan soldier claimed that Saadi had personally ordered to shoot unarmed protestors in Benghazi when visiting the city's army barracks at the beginning of the uprising.  Saadi confirmed that he had been at the barracks but denied giving orders to fire on protestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcpanorama&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12789740 | title=Saadi Gaddafi 'gave order to shoot' in Benghazi revolt | work=BBC World News | date=March 21, 2011 | accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saadi was the driving force behind a change in the tactics of the Libyan government forces. Instead of fighting the rebels with heavy infantry, tanks and armored cars â which could easily be distinguished from the rebels and then destroyed by allied fighter jets â the fight against the rebels was pursued with small, fast and versatile units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.oe24.at/welt/libyen/Gaddafi-trickst-Rebellen-aus/21629016 | title=Gaddafi trickst Rebellen aus | trans_title=Gaddafi tricks with rebels | work=OE24 | date=30 March 2011 | accessdate=15 October 2011 | last=Wendl | first=Karl | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rebels claimed that they captured him during the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Battle of Tripoli]], on 21 August, but later the claim turned out to be false.

On 24 August, Al-Saadi contacted [[CNN]], stating that he had the authority to negotiate on behalf of loyalist forces, and wished to discuss a ceasefire with US and NATO authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/08/24/libya.saadi.gadhafi/index.html | work=CNN | title=Gadhafi son offers to broker Libya cease-fire |accessdate=September 4, 2011|date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later he contacted [[Al Arabiya]], stating his father was ready to step down, and called for dialog with the [[National Transitional Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/08/31/164891.html|title=Saadi Qaddafi tells Al Arabiya his father is ready to relinquish power|date=31 August 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|work=Al Arabiya|first=Mustapha|last=Ajbaili}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September, he said in an interview with CNN that an &quot;aggressive&quot; speech by his brother [[Saif al-Islam]] had led to the breakdown of talks between NTC forces and Gaddafi loyalists in [[Bani Walid]], and said he had not seen his father in two months. He also claimed a position of neutrality in the conflict and offered to mediate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/gaddafis-son-blames-brother-over-speech-20110905-1jtgp.html | title=Gaddafi's son blames brother over speech | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=September 5, 2011 | agency=Associated Foreign Press | accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September, Saadi fled to [[Niger]] and was allowed entrance on humanitarian grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/09/2011911185616845334.html|title=Gaddafi son found as NTC rallies forces|work=Al Jazeera|date=11 September 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = natpost2&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/10/31/government-urged-to-proble-gaddafi-sons-bodyguard-who-is-based-in-canada/ | work=The National Post | first=Tamsin | last=McMahon | title=Probe urged into how Ontario-based bodyguard helped Gaddafiâs son flee from Libya | date=2011-10-31 |location=Toronto|accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government of Niger, they plan to detain Al-Saadi while determining what to do with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/liveblog/libya-sep-12-2011-2253|work=Al Jazeera|accessdate=15 October 2011|date=12 September 2011|title=Mon, 12 Sep 2011, 19:53|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Saadi Gaddafi had also planned to escape to [[Barbados]] or [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name = natpost3&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/10/31/ontario-man-offered-contractors-1000-a-day-to-transport-gaddafis-son/ | work=The National Post | first=Stewart | last=Bell | title=Ontario man offered contractors $1,000 a day to transport Gaddafiâs son | date=2011-10-31 |location=Toronto|accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 September, an Interpol [[red notice]] was issued for Saadi. [[Brigi Rafini]], the prime minister of Niger said he would not allow Saadi to be extradited.&lt;ref name = Tel20110929/&gt;
