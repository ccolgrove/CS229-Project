Despite posting its second consecutive undefeated, untied season, the Nittany Lions did not have a shot at the national championship. President [[Richard Nixon]] said that he would consider the winner of the December 6 matchup between the [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]] and the [[Arkansas Razorbacks]], then ranked at the top of the polls, and the real voters do not seem to have differed.  At the time, national champions were selected before bowl games were played. Paterno, at the 1973 commencement, was quoted saying, &quot;I'd like to know how could the president know so little about Watergate in 1973 and so much about college football in 1969?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bixon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06321/739083-198.stm|last=Anderson|first=Shelly|title=Research shows Nixon hurt '69 Lions|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2006-11-17|accessdate=2007-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of using ineligible players, the Oklahoma Sooners were ordered to forfeit seven wins from their 1972 season, including their on-field win over the Nittany Lions. However, Paterno and Penn State refused to accept the forfeit, and the bowl game is officially recorded as a loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After Further Review...
