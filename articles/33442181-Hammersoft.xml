==Athletic Department history and information==
[[Image:FIUGoldenPanthers.png|thumb|left|150px|The old Golden Panther logo used from 2001 to 2008.]]
FIUâs colors are navy blue and gold, and their mascot is the Golden Panther (taken from the [[Florida panther]], an endangered species endemic to the nearby [[Everglades]]), which is embodied by an [[Florida panther|panther]] named Roary the Panther. The school's original nickname was the &quot;Sunblazers&quot;, but it was changed in 1987 to the current. 

FIU is a member of the NCAA, participating in Division I, and the Sun Belt Conference in all sports except for men's soccer (which competes in [[Conference USA]] as an affiliate member). FIU joined the Sun Belt Conference in 1998 having previously competed in the [[Atlantic Sun Conference|Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC)]], from 1991 to 1998.

FIU's Athletic Department has produced several professional and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] athletes, including current players in [[Major League Baseball]], [[Major League Soccer]], the [[National Basketball Association]], the [[National Football League]], and in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. 

FIU's main rivals are the [[Miami Hurricanes|University of Miami Hurricanes]] and the [[Florida Atlantic Owls|Florida Atlantic University Owls]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

FIUâs baseball team began play in 1973 as a Division II member and is one of the most successful programs in the schoolâs history.

The other five appearances came as a Division II program and included a Division II College World Series appearance. 

Many players from past years have been drafted by [[Major League Baseball]] teams and have played in the majors.

The FIU [[FIU Golden Panthers Football|Golden Panthers football team]] competes in the NCAA FBS [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (formerly known as Division 1-A), the highest level in intercollegiate football, and is a member of the [[Sun Belt Conference]]. They are led by head coach [[Mario Cristobal]] and play at [[FIU Stadium]] on FIU's University Park campus. The team began playing in 2002 as a member of NCAA Division 1-AA, now known as the NCAA FCS [[Football Championship Subdivision]]. Three years later, the FIU Athletics Department decided to move the program up to Division 1-A. FIU became the fastest school to make such a move from a program's inception.

On August 29, 2002, the program played its first game at home against [[Saint Peter's College, New Jersey|Saint Peter's College]] in front of a sold out crowd of 17,314. FIU defeated St. Peters's by the score of 27â3.

The FIU football team's main rival are the [[Florida Atlantic Owls]]. Both teams play annually in a game known as the [[Shula Bowl]]. The game is named after former [[Miami Dolphins]] Head Coach [[Don Shula]].

===Men's soccer===
FIU has won two [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|national championships]] in men's soccer. In 1982, FIU beat [[Southern Connecticut State University|Southern Connecticut State]] by the score of 2â1, to win the school's first national title in any sport. Two years later the Panthers won their second national title beating [[Seattle Pacific University]] 1â0. To date these are the only national titles the university has achieved in athletic competition.

The men's soccer team competes as an affiliate member of [[Conference USA]], and is the only FIU team to do so. This relationship began in 2005 and was formed since the Sun Belt Conference does not sponsor men's soccer. The team previously played in the [[Atlantic Soccer Conference]] from 2000 to 2004 and the Trans America Athletic Conference from 1991 to 1999.

FIU has regularly qualified for the NCAA Tournament in men's soccer, both as Division I and Division II program. In addition to the national championships achieved by the team as a Division II program, the team reached the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] championship game in 1996, losing to [[St. John's University, New York|St. John's University]] 4-1. 

Recently, two new soccer fields were finished in the summer of 2007 on the northwest side of campus. These fields will complement the other two, making four soccer fields for use by both the men and women's soccer teams, as well as practice fields for the football team.

===FIU Stadium===
{{Main|FIU Stadium}}
FIU Stadium was originally opened in [[1995]] as a standard [[track and field athletics]] stadium, with mobile seats for the football end zones and an artificial turf infield.  In [[2007]], the stadium was closed and converted into a dedicated football stadium, with the track removed, the original turf replaced with [[FieldTurf]], and permanent stands providing 20,000 seats.  It was re-opened in time for the [[2008]] college football season.  Further improvements to FIU Stadium are ongoing, with a future capacity target of 45,000 seats.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

During FIU Stadium's reconstruction, the Panthers football team played at the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] in the 2007 season, and actually won the final college football game played at the stadium before it was demolished to make way for the new [[Miami Ballpark|Marlins' ballpark]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The Florida International University Golden Panthers basketball and volleyball teams play there. It was originally named Sunblazer Arena but was renamed Golden Panther Arena when FIU's athletic teams changed their nickname from Sunblazers to Golden Panthers in 1987. It was eventually renamed on September 1, 2004 in honor of Pharmed Group after a $1 million USD donation was made to the FIU athletic department by Pharmed owners Jorge and Carlos de Cespedes, but was changed to &quot;FIU Arena&quot; in 2008.{{Why|date=October 2009}} Other events such as MTV's Campus Invasion, music concerts, ceremonies and fairs are also held year-round at the arena.

====Old Lyrics====
From the green fields of Tamiami&lt;br&gt;[[File:LisetBrito.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Liset Brito of FIU during a women's tennis match vs. Louisiana-Lafayette at FIU in 2009.]]
To the north shore of Biscayne Bay&lt;br&gt;
Here's the place where we can gather,&lt;br&gt;
Where Golden Panthers hunt their prey&lt;br&gt;
Anyone who tries to defeat us&lt;br&gt;
Better think twice and stand aside,&lt;br&gt;
Bring them here with their fear to Miami&lt;br&gt;
And when they come we'll show our Panther Pride&lt;br&gt;
Golden Panthers, see the paw,&lt;br&gt;
We will fight, you'll feel the claw!&lt;br&gt;
Let's go Panthers, Gold and Blue,&lt;br&gt;
Fight For FIU!

====New Lyrics====
[[Image:FIU-flag-shula-bowl.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Touchdown flag flown by the FIU Cheerleaders during the 7th annual [[Shula Bowl]]]]

We are the panthers of FIU,&lt;br/&gt;
the Golden Panthers of FIU.&lt;br/&gt;
We will continue to fight&lt;br/&gt;
with all of our might&lt;br/&gt;
for victory for gold and blue.&lt;br/&gt;
We stand together and proudly say:&lt;br/&gt;
our Golden Panthers go all the way.&lt;br/&gt;
We'll always strive for victory&lt;br/&gt;
blue-blooded through and through,&lt;br/&gt;
'cause we're FIU.

Go F!&lt;br/&gt;
Go I!&lt;br/&gt;
Go U!&lt;br/&gt;
Go F-I-U!&lt;br/&gt;
Panthers fight!&lt;br/&gt;
Panthers fight!&lt;br/&gt;
Panthers fight!&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
''(repeat)''
