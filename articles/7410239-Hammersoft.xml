'''Disney Channel Asia''', a franchise of [[Disney Channel]], airs in most parts of [[Southeast Asia]].

== Programming ==

Disney Channel Asia airs a variety of shows, aimed particularly at children and teenagers. Most of the programming is similar to the American counterpart with some shows exclusive to the Asian version such as ''[[Upin &amp; Ipin]]'' and ''[[Waktu Rehat]]'', both originally created in [[Malaysia]]. Disney Channel Asia often holds promos that offer prizes to promote shows or movies.

==Censorship==
Because of the Muslim population in countries that the channel broadcasts, content deemed not acceptable in Asian culture are edited out. Bad language, violence, and kisses are those that are often either shortened or removed altogether. However, suggestive dialog is sometimes not edited out. The Philippine feed, however, has been known to be very liberal in edits and thus programs are rarely edited as much as the other regional versions.


== Criticism ==
{{see also|Disney Channel#Criticism}}
Since Disney Channel Asia follows the [[Disney Channel|Disney Channel US]] guideline, the channel has received similar criticisms: being moved from premium, limited cables to more basic, widespread cables and showing less shows based on characters that made Disney famous, such as [[Mickey Mouse]].
It also has a reputation for having bad management, due to the move of the shows starring the original characters, and it has even come to the point where they don't air any of them.
==Sister Channels==
