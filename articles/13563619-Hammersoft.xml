'''ABC Goulburn Murray''' (call sign: '''3MRR''') is an [[ABC Local Radio]] station based in [[Albury-Wodonga]], formerly known as 2CO. From studios located in [[Wodonga]], the station covers parts of northern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and southern [[New South Wales]] including [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]], [[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]], [[Wangaratta, Victoria|Wangaratta]], and [[Benalla, Victoria|Benalla]].

The station's lineup of local programming includes a breakfast program from 6.00-8.30am hosted by Belinda King as well as a morning show presented by Joseph Thomsen.

In 1934 the station played a role in the [[MacRobertson Air Race]] when the Uiver, lost after becoming caught in a thunderstorm, ended up over [[Albury, New South Wales]]. Arthur Newnham, the announcer, appealed for cars to line up on the racecourse to light up a runway for the plane.  The plane landed, and next morning was pulled out of the mud by locals to fly on and win the handicap section of the race.
