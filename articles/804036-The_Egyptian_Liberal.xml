The term '''''caliphate''''', &quot;dominion of a [[caliph]] ('successor')&quot; (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Ø®ÙØ§ÙØ© or khilÄfa, {{lang-tr|Hilafet}}), refers to the first system of government established in Islam and represented the political unity of the Muslim [[Ummah]] (community). In theory, it is an [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]]â[[constitutional republic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lecker |first=Michael|title=The âConstitution of Medinaâ: Muhammad's First Legal Document|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |year=2008|volume=19|issue=2|pages=251â253|doi=10.1093/jis/etn021 |accessdate=9 December 2010|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Constitution]] being the [[Constitution of Medina]]), which means that the [[head of state]], the [[Caliph]], and other officials are representatives of the people and of [[Islam]] and must govern according to constitutional and [[religious law]], or [[Sharia]]. In its early days, it resembled elements of [[direct democracy]] (see [[shura]]) and an [[elective monarchy]].

It was initially led by [[Muhammad]]'s disciples as a continuation of the political and religious system the prophet established, known as the '[[Rashidun]] caliphates'. A &quot;caliphate&quot; is also a [[Sovereign state|state]] which implements such a governmental system.

[[Sunni Islam]] stipulates that the head of state, the [[caliph]], should be selected by [[Shura]] â [[Election|elected]] by [[Muslim]]s or their representatives.&lt;ref name=2muslims&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2muslims.com/directory/Detailed/225505.shtml |title=Gharm Allah Al-Ghamdy |publisher=2muslims.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followers of [[Shia Islam]] believe the caliph should be an [[imam]] chosen by God from the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] (Muhammad's purified progeny). After the [[Rashidun]] period until 1924, caliphates, sometimes two at a single time, real and illusory, were ruled by dynasties. The first dynasty was the [[Umayyad]]. This was followed by the [[Abbasid]], the [[Fatimid]] (not recognized by others outside Fatimid domain), and finally the [[Ottoman Dynasty]].

The caliphate was &quot;the core political concept of Sunni Islam, by the consensus of the Muslim majority in the early centuries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John O. Voll: Professor of Islamic history at Georgetown University [http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=13296 Revivalism, Shiâa Style]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The caliph was often known as ''[[Amir al-Mu'minin]]'' (Ø£ÙÙØ± Ø§ÙÙØ¤ÙÙÙÙ) &quot;Commander of the Believers&quot;. Muhammad established his capital in [[Medina]], and after he died it remained the capital for the [[Rashidun]] period. At times in [[Muslim history]] there have been rival claimant caliphs in different parts of the Islamic world, and divisions between the Shi'a and Sunni communities.

According to Sunni Muslims, the first caliph to be called ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' was [[Abu Bakr Siddique]], followed by [[Umar ibn al-KhattÄb]], the second of the [[Rashidun|Four Rightly Guided Caliphs]]. [[Uthman ibn Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] also were called by the same title, while the Shi'a consider Ali to have been the first and only truly legitimate caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/ali.htm |title=Lexic Orient.com |publisher=Lexic Orient.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rulers preceding these first four did not receive this title by consensus, and as it was turned into a monarchy thereafter.

After the first four caliphs, the Caliphate was claimed by dynasties such as the [[Umayyads]], the [[Abbasids]], and the [[Ottomans]], and for relatively short periods by other, competing dynasties in [[al-Andalus]], [[North Africa]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]], who received the throne after [[AbdÃ¼lmecid II]] officially abolished the system of Caliphate in Islam (the Ottoman Empire) and founded the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]], in 1924. The [[List of rulers of Morocco|Kings of Morocco]] still label themselves with the title ''Amir al-Mu'minin'' for the [[Demographics of Morocco|Moroccans]], but lay no claim to the Caliphate.

Some Muslim countries, like [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] were never subject to the authority of a Caliphate, with the exception of [[Aceh]], which briefly acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty.&lt;ref&gt;New world hegemony in the Malay world, By Geoffrey C. Gunn, pg. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently these countries had their own, local, sultans or rulers who did not fully accept the authority of the Caliph.  

===Rashidun, 632â661===
{{Main|Rashidun|Rashidun Caliphate}}
{{See also|Muslim conquests}}
[[File:Califate 750.jpg|thumb|left|Islamic caliphate]]

Abu Bakr, the first successor of Muhammad, nominated Umar as his successor on his deathbed, and there was [[consensus]] in the Muslim community to his choice. Umar Ibn Khattab, the second caliph, was killed by a servant. His successor, Uthman Ibn Affan, was elected by a council of electors ([[Majlis]]), but was soon perceived by some to be ruling as a &quot;king&quot; rather than an elected leader. Uthman was killed by members of a disaffected group. Ali then took control but was not universally accepted as caliph by the governors of Egypt, and later by some of his own guard. He faced two major rebellions and was assassinated after a tumultuous rule of only five years. This period is known as the [[First Fitna|Fitna]], or the first Islamic civil war. Under the Rashidun each region ([[Sultan]]ate, [[Wilayah]], or [[Emirate]]) of the Caliphate had its own governor (Sultan, [[WÄli]] or [[Emir]]).

[[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]], a relative of Uthman and governor (''Wali'') of [[Syria]], became one of Ali's challengers and after Ali's death managed to overcome the other claimants to the Caliphate. Muawiyah transformed the caliphate into a [[Inherit|hereditary]] office, thus founding the Umayyad [[dynasty]].

In areas which were previously under [[Sassanid Persia]]n or [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, the Caliphs lowered taxes, provided greater local autonomy (to their delegated governors), greater religious freedom for [[Jew]]s, and some indigenous [[Christian]]s, and brought peace to peoples demoralized and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the decades of [[RomanâPersian Wars|Byzantine-Persian warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Esposito]] (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Umayyads, 7thâ8th centuries===
{{Main|Umayyad Caliphate}}
[[File:Age-of-caliphs.png|thumb|left|The Caliphate, 622â750 {{legend|#a1584e|Expansion under the Prophet Muhammad, 622â632}} {{legend|#ef9070|Expansion during the Rashidun Caliphs, 632â661}} {{legend|#fad07d|Expansion during the Umayyad Caliphate, 661â750}}]]

Under the Umayyads, the Caliphate grew rapidly in territory. Islamic rule expanded westward across North Africa and into [[Hispania]] and eastward through Persia and ultimately to the ancient lands of [[Indus Valley]], in modern day [[Pakistan]]. This made it one of the largest unitary states in history and one of the few states to ever extend direct rule over three [[continents]] ([[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]]). Although not ruling all of the [[Sahara]], homage was paid to the Caliph by Saharan Africa, usually via various [[nomad]] [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. However, it should be noted that, although these vast areas may have recognised the supremacy of the Caliph, de facto power was in the hands of local sultans and emirs.

For a variety of reasons, including that they were not elected via [[Shura]] and suggestions of impious behaviour, the Umayyad dynasty was not universally supported within the Muslim community. Some supported prominent early Muslims like [[Al-Zubayr]]; others felt that only members of Muhammad's clan, the [[Banu Hashim]], or his own lineage, the descendants of Ali, should rule.

There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads, as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks (notably, the rivalry between Yaman and Qays). Eventually, supporters of the Banu Hashim and the supporters of the lineage of Ali united to bring down the Umayyads in 750. However, the ''{{Unicode|ShiÊ»at Ê»AlÄ«}}'', &quot;the Party of Ali&quot;, were again disappointed when the [[Abbasid dynasty]] took power, as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammad's uncle, [[`Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib]] and not from Ali. Following this disappointment, the {{Unicode|ShiÊ»at Ê»AlÄ«}} finally split from the majority Sunni Muslims and formed what are today the several {{Unicode|ShiÊ»a}} denominations.

====The Caliphate in Hispania====
{{Main|Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba|Almohad dynasty}}

During the Ummayad dynasty, Hispania was an integral province of the Ummayad Caliphate ruled from [[Damascus]], Syria. When the Caliphate was seized by the Abbasids, ''[[Al-Andalus]]'' (the Arab name for Hispania) split from the Abbasid Caliph in [[Baghdad]] to form their own caliphate. The '''Caliphate of CÃ³rdoba''' (Ø®ÙÙÙØ© ÙØ±Ø·Ø¨Ø©) ruled most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the city of [[CÃ³rdoba, Spain|CÃ³rdoba]] from 929 to 1031. This period was characterized by remarkable flourishing in technology, trade and culture; many of the masterpieces of [[Spain]] were constructed in this period, including the famous [[Mezquita de CÃ³rdoba|Great Mosque of CÃ³rdoba]]. The title '''''Caliph''''' (Ø®ÙÙÙØ©) was claimed by [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] on 16 January 929; he was previously known as the '''Emir of CÃ³rdoba''' (Ø£ÙÙØ± ÙØ±Ø·Ø¨Ø©).

All Caliphs of CÃ³rdoba were members of the Umayyad dynasty; the same dynasty had held the title Emir of CÃ³rdoba and ruled over roughly the same territory since 756. The rule of the Caliphate is considered as the heyday of Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula, before it fragmented into various [[taifa]]s in the 11th century.

===Abbasids, 8thâ13th centuries===
{{Main|Abbasid Caliphate|Fatimid Caliphate}}
{{See also|Islamic Golden Age|Muslim Agricultural Revolution}}
[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mustansiriya University]] in [[Baghdad]]]]

The Umayyad dynasty was overthrown by another family of [[Mecca]]n origin, the Abbasids, in 750. The Abbasids had an unbroken line of Caliphs for over three centuries, consolidating Islamic rule and cultivating great intellectual and cultural developments in the [[Middle East]]. By 940, however, the power of the Caliphate under the Abbasids was waning as non-Arabs, particularly the Berbers of the [[Maghreb]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], and later, in the latter half of the 13th century, the [[Mamluk]]s in Egypt, gained influence, and the various subordinate sultans and emirs became increasingly independent.

However, the Caliphate endured as a symbolic position. During the period of the Abbasid dynasty, Abbasid claims to the caliphate did not go unchallenged. The {{Unicode|ShiÊ»a}} [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah]] of the Fatimid dynasty, which claimed descent from Muhammad through his daughter, claimed the title of Caliph in 909, creating a separate line of caliphs in North Africa.

Initially controlling [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]], the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years, taking Egypt and [[Palestine]], before the Abbasid dynasty was able to turn the tide, limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt. The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171. The Umayyad dynasty, which had survived and come to rule over the Muslim provinces of Spain, reclaimed the title of Caliph in 929, lasting until it was overthrown in 1031.

===Fatimids, 10thâ12th centuries===
{{Main|Fatimid}}
[[File:Fatimid Islamic Caliphate.png|thumb|right|Map of the Fatimid Caliphate also showing cities]]

The Fatimid Caliphate or al-FÄtimiyyÅ«n (Arabic Ø§ÙÙØ§Ø·ÙÙÙÙ) was a Shi'a dynasty that ruled over varying areas of the Maghreb, Egypt, Sicily, Malta and the Levant from 5 January 909 to 1171. The caliphate was ruled by the Fatimids, who established the Egyptian city of Cairo as their capital. The term Fatimite is sometimes used to refer to the citizens of this caliphate{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. The ruling elite of the state belonged to the Ismaili branch of Shi'ism. The leaders of the dynasty were also Shia Ismaili Imams, hence, they had a religious significance to Ismaili Muslims.

===Shadow Caliphate, 13thâ16th centuries===
1258 saw the conquest of Baghdad and the execution of Abbasid caliph [[al-Musta'sim]] by [[Mongols|Mongol]] forces under [[Hulagu Khan]]. A surviving member of the Abbasid house was installed as caliph at Cairo under the patronage of the newly formed [[Mamluk Empire|Mamluk Sultanate]] three years later; however, this line of caliphs had generally little authority although some Abbasid rulers had the actual rule over the Mamluk Sultans. Later Muslim historians referred to it as a &quot;shadow&quot; caliphate. Thus, the title continued into the early 16th century.

===Ottomans, 16thâ20th century===
[[File:Liannos-Local-Ottoman-Post.JPG|thumb|Ottoman postage stamps issued for the Liannos City Post of Constantinople in 1865]]
{{Main|Ottoman Caliphate}}

Ottoman rulers (generally known as Sultans in the West) were known primarily by the title of [[Padishah]] and used the title of Caliph only sporadically. [[Mehmed II]] and his grandson [[Selim I]] used it to justify their conquest of Islamic countries. As the Ottoman Empire grew in size and strength, Ottoman rulers beginning with Selim I began to claim Caliphal authority.

Ottoman rulers used the title &quot;Caliph&quot; symbolically on many occasions but it was strengthened when the Ottoman Empire defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517 and took control of most Arab lands. The last Abbasid Caliph at Cairo, [[al-Mutawakkil III]], was taken into custody and was transported to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], where he reportedly surrendered the Caliphate to Selim I. According to Barthold, the first time the title of &quot;Caliph&quot; was used as a political instead of symbolic religious title by the Ottomans was the [[Treaty of KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼k Kaynarca|peace treaty with Russia]] in [[1774]].

The outcome of [[Russo-Turkish War (1768â1774)|Russo-Turkish War of 1768-1774]] war was disastrous for the Ottomans. Large territories, including those with large Muslim populations, such as [[Crimea]], were lost to the [[Russian Empire]]. However, the Ottomans under [[Abdul Hamid I]] claimed a diplomatic victory by being allowed to remain the religious leader of Muslims in the now-independent Crimea as part of the peace treaty: in return Russia became the official protector of Christians in Ottoman territory. This was the first time the Ottoman caliph was acknowledged as having significance outside of Ottoman borders by a European power.

Around 1880 Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] reasserted the title as a way of countering Russian expansion into Muslim lands. His claim was most fervently accepted by the Muslims of [[British Raj|British India]]. By the eve of the [[World War I|First World War]], the Ottoman state, despite its weakness relative to Europe, represented the largest and most powerful independent Islamic political entity. The sultan also enjoyed some authority beyond the borders of his shrinking empire as caliph of Muslims in Egypt, [[India]] and [[Central Asia]].

===Sokoto, 19th century===
{{Main|Sokoto Caliphate}}

The Sokoto Caliphate was an [[Islam]]ic spiritual community in [[Nigeria]], led by the [[Sultan of Sokoto]], [[Saâadu Abubakar]]. Founded during the [[Fulani Jihad]] in the early 19th century, it was one of the most powerful empires in sub-Saharan Africa prior to European conquest and colonization. The caliphate remained extant through the colonial period and afterwards, though with reduced power.

 
===Ahmadiyya Caliphate, 1908-Present===
{{Main|Khalifatul Masih}}

[[File:Ghana Khilafat Ahmadiyya Stamp 2008.jpg|right|thumb|A stamp issued by [[Ghana]] to mark the centenary of the establishment of the [[Khalifatul Masih|Ahmadiyya Caliphate]] in 2008.]]

The [[Ahmadiyya]] a [[messianic]] movement in Islam, believe that the [[Khalifatul Masih|Ahmadiyya Caliphate]] established after the passing of the community's founder [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], is the re-establishment of the Rashdin Caliphate, as prophesized by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/egazette/updates/the-islamic-khilafat-its-rise-fall-and-re-emergence/ | title=The Islamic Khilafat â Its Rise, Fall, and Re-emergence | accessdate=March 8, 2011 | author=Ahmad, Rafi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current successor to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is [[Khalifatul Masih]] V, [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]] residing in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reviewofreligions.org/1772/editorial-68/ | title=Hadhrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad, Khalifatul Masih V | accessdate=March 9, 2011 | publisher=The Review of Religions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ahmadiyya]] Community was founded in 1889 by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] of [[Qadian]], [[India]], who claimed to be the Promised [[Messiah]] and [[Mahdi]], the one awaited by followers of all major religions. After his demise in 1908, his first successor, Maulvi [[Hakeem Noor-ud-Din]] became head of the community and assumed the title of [[Khalifatul Masih]] (Caliph). The line of successors continues to this day to Khalifatul Masih V [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]], residing in [[London]], [[England]]. From its outset, the Ahmadiyya Community has been viewed as heretical by mainstream Muslim groups due to the founder's claim to prophethood. Majority of Muslims today hold the view that [[Muhammad]] was the [[seal of the prophets|final prophet]] and no apostle can come after him. Ahmadis however call themselves Muslims and claim to practice Islam in its pristine form.

Although the Ahmadiyya Caliphate is not recognized by mainstream Islam, the community continues to operate under this structure, with the Khalifa having overall authority for all religious and organizational matters. According to Ahmadis, it is not essential for a Khalifa to be the head of a state, rather the spiritual and religious significance of the Khalifatul Masih is emphasized. Ahmadis believe that the Ahmadiyya Caliphate is the re-establishment of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (The Rightly Guided Calphs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alislam.org/topics/khilafat/ | title=The Ahmadiyya Khalifat | accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khilafat Movement, 1920===
{{Main|Khilafat Movement}}
{{See also|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire}}

In the 1920s, the [[Khilafat Movement]], a movement to defend the Ottoman Caliphate, spread throughout the British colonial territories. It was particularly strong in British India, where it formed a rallying point for some Indian Muslims as one of many anti-British Indian political movements. Its leaders included [[Maulana Mohammad Ali]], his brother Shawkat Ali, and [[Abul Kalam Azad]], [[Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari]], and [[Barrister Muhammad Jan Abbasi]]. For a time it worked in alliance with [[Hindu]] communities and was supported by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], who was a member of the Central Khilafat Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indhistory.com/khilafat-movement.html |title=The Khilafat Movement |publisher=Indhistory.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quaid.gov.pk/politician6.htm The Statesman]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the movement lost its momentum after the arrest or flight of its leaders, and a series of offshoots splintered off from the main organization.

===End of the Caliphate, 1924===
{{Further|[[AtatÃ¼rk's Reforms]]}}

On March 3, 1924, the first [[List of Presidents of Turkey|President of the Turkish Republic]], [[Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]], as part of his [[AtatÃ¼rk's Reforms|reforms]], constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate. Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]], the parliament of the newly formed Turkish Republic. The title was then [[Sharifian Caliphate|claimed]] by [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|King Hussein bin Ali]] of [[Hejaz]], leader of the [[Arab Revolt]], but his kingdom was defeated and annexed by [[Ibn Saud]] in 1925. The title has since been inactive.

Ottoman influence on other nations, such as in India, may have also been lossed due to its ending of caliphate

A summit was convened at [[Cairo]] in 1926 to discuss the revival of the Caliphate, but most Muslim countries did not participate and no action was taken to implement the summit's resolutions.

Though the title ''Ameer al-Mumineen'' was adopted by the King of Morocco and by [[Mullah]] [[Mohammed Omar]], former head of the [[Taliban]] regime of [[Afghanistan]], neither claimed any legal standing or authority over Muslims outside the borders of their respective countries, there power had also been partially yet not fully restricted in an on-going war with the western NATO military alliance.

==Religious basis==
{{See|Political aspects of Islam|Divisions of the world in Islam}}

===Qur'an===
The following excerpt from the [[Qur'an]], known as the 'Istikhlaf Verse', is used by some to argue for a Quranic basis for Caliphate:

{{quote |God has promised those of you who have attained to faith and do righteous deeds that, of a certainty, He will make them ''Khulifa'' on earth, even as He caused [some of] those who lived before them to become ''Khulifa''; and that, of a certainty, He will firmly establish for them the religion which He has been pleased to bestow on them; and that, of a certainty, He will cause their erstwhile state of fear to be replaced by a sense of security [seeing that] they worship Me [alone], not ascribing divine powers to aught beside Me. But all who, after [having understood] this, choose to deny the truth â it is they, they who are truly iniquitous!&quot; [24:55] (Surah Al-Nur, Verse 55)
}}

In the above verse the word ''Khulifa'' (the plural of ''Khalifa'') has been variously translated as &quot;successors&quot; and &quot;ones who accede to power&quot;.

Small subsections of Sunni Islamism argue that to govern a state by Islamic law ([[Shariah]]) is, by definition, to rule via the Caliphate, and use the following verses to sustain their claim.

{{quote|So govern between the people by that which God has revealed (Islam), and follow not their vain desires, beware of them in case they seduce you from just some part of that which God has revealed to you|{{Quran|004|049}}||}}

{{quote|O you who believe! Obey God, and obey the messenger and then those among you who are in authority; and if you have a dispute concerning any matter, refer it to God and the messenger's rulings, if you are (in truth) believers in God and the Last Day. That is better and more seemly in the end.|{{Quran|004|059}}||}}

===Hadith===
The following [[Hadith]] from [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] can be understood to prophesy two eras of Caliphate (both on the lines/precepts of prophethood).

{{quote |Hadhrat Huzaifa narrated that the Messenger of Allah said: Prophethood will remain among you as long as Allah wills. Then Caliphate (Khilafah) on the lines of Prophethood shall commence, and remain as long as Allah wills. Then corrupt/erosive monarchy would take place, and it will remain as long as Allah wills. After that, despotic kingship would emerge, and it will remain as long as Allah wills. Then, the Caliphate (Khilafah) shall come once again based on the precept of [[Prophethood]].&lt;ref&gt;Masnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Mishkat, Chapter Al-Anzar Wal Tahzir&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}}}

In the above Hadith the first era of Caliphate is commonly accepted by the Muslims as that of the [[Rashidun|Rashidun Caliphate]].

Nafi'a reported saying:

{{quote|It has been reported on the authority of Nafi, that 'Abdullah b. Umar paid a visit to Abdullah b. Muti' in the days (when atrocities were perpetrated on the People Of Medina) at Harra in the time of Yazid b. Mu'awiya. Ibn Muti' said: Place a pillow for Abu 'Abd al-Rahman (family name of 'Abdullah b. 'Umar). But the latter said: I have not come to sit with you. I have come to you to tell you a tradition I heard from the Messenger of Allah. I heard him say: One who withdraws his band from obedience (to the Amir) will find no argument (in his defence) when he stands before Allah on the Day of Judgment, and one who dies without having bound himself by an oath of allegiance (to an Amir) will die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahiliyyah. â Sahih Muslim, Book 020, Hadith 4562.}}

[[Hisham ibn Urwah]] reported on the authority of [[Abu Saleh]] on the authority of [[Abu Hurairah]] that Muhammad said:

{{quote |Leaders will take charge of you after me, where the pious (one) will lead you with his piety and the impious (one) with his impiety, so only listen to them and obey them in everything which conforms with the truth (Islam). If they act rightly it is for your credit, and if they acted wrongly it is counted for you and against them.}}

Muslim narrated on the authority of [[al-A'araj]], on the authority of [[Abu Hurairah]], that Muhammad said:

{{quote|Behold, the Imam (Caliph) is but a shield from behind whom the people fight and by whom they defend themselves.}}

Muslim reported on the authority of [[Abdel Aziz al-Muqrin]], who said,
{{quote|I accompanied Abu Hurairah for five years and heard him talking of Muhammd's saying: The Prophets ruled over the children of Israel, whenever a Prophet died another Prophet succeeded him, but there will be no Prophet after me. There will be [[Khalifa]]hs and they will number many. They asked: What then do you order us? He said: Fulfil the baya'a to them one after the other and give them their due. Surely God will ask them about what He entrusted them with.}}

===The Sahaba of Muhammad===
[[Al-Habbab Ibn ul-Munthir]] said, when the Sahaba met in the wake of the death of Muhammad, (at the [[Saqifah|thaqifa]] hall) of Bani Saâida: {{quote|Let there be one Amir from us and one Amir from you (meaning one from the Ansar and one from the Mohajireen).}} Upon this Abu Bakr replied: {{quote|It is forbidden for Muslims to have two Amirs (rulers)...}}

Then he got up and addressed the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As-Sirah&quot; of [[Ibn Kathir]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tarikh ut-Tabari&quot; by at-Tabari&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Siratu Ibn Hisham&quot; by [[Ibn Hisham]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;As-Sunan ul-Kubra&quot; of Bayhaqi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Al-fasil-fil Milal&quot; by [[Ibnu Hazim]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Al-Aâkd Al-Farid&quot; of Al-Waqidi&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

It has additionally been reported&lt;ref&gt;&quot;as-Sirah&quot; of Ibnu Ishaq&lt;/ref&gt; that Abu Bakr went on to say on the day of Al-Saqifa: {{quote|It is forbidden for Muslims to have two Amirs for this would cause differences in their affairs and concepts, their unity would be divided and disputes would break out amongst them. The [[Sunnah]] would then be abandoned, the [[Bidâah|bidaâa]] (innovations) would spread and Fitna would grow, and that is in no oneâs interests.}}

The Sahaba agreed to this and selected Abu Bakr as their first Khaleef. Habbab ibn Mundhir who suggested the idea of two Ameers corrected himself and was the first to give Abu Bakr the [[Bay'ah]]. This indicates an [[Ijma as-Sahaba]] of all of the Sahaba. Ali ibni abi Talib, who was attending the body of Muhammad at the time, also consented to this.

Imam Ali whom the Shia revere said:&lt;ref&gt;Nahj-ul-Balagha (part 1 page 91)&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|People must have an Amir...where the believer works under his Imara (rule) and under which the unbeliever would also benefit, until his rule ended by the end of his life (ajal), the booty (fayâi) would be gathered, the enemy would be fought, the routes would be made safe, the strong one will return what he took from the weak till the tyrant would be contained, and not bother anyone.}}

===The sayings of Islamic scholars===
[[Al-Mawardi]] says:&lt;ref&gt;Al-ahkam Al-Sultaniyah page 9&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|It is forbidden for the Ummah (Muslim world) to have two leaders at the same time.}}

[[Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi]] (Al-Nawawi) says:&lt;ref&gt;Mughni Al-Muhtaj, volume 4, page 132&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|It is forbidden to give an oath to two leaders or more, even in different parts of the world and even if they are far apart.}}

===Ahmadiyya View===
The first era of Caliphate mentioned in the above saying of [[Muhammad]] is commonly accepted by Muslims as that of the [[Rashidun]].

===Islamic call===
{{Islamism sidebar}}
A number of Islamist political parties and [[mujahideen]] have called for the restoration of the caliphate by uniting Muslim nations, either through political action (e.g., [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]]), or through force (e.g., [[al-Qaeda]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=View all comments that have been posted about this article. |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/13/AR2006011301816_pf.html |title=Reunified Islam |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2006-01-13 |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various Islamist movements have gained momentum in recent years with the ultimate aim of establishing a Caliphate; however, they differ in their methodology and approach. Some{{who|date=November 2010}} are locally oriented, mainstream political parties that have no apparent transnational objectives.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

[[Abul Ala Maududi]] believed the caliph was not just an individual ruler who had to be restored, but was man's representation of [[God]]'s authority on earth:
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;''Khilafa'' means representative. Man, according to Islam is the representative of &quot;people&quot;, His (God's) viceregent; that is to say, by virtue of the powers delegated to him, and within the limits prescribed by the Qu'ran and the teaching of the prophet, the caliph is required to exercise Divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Abul A'al Mawdudi, ''Human Rights in Islam'', The Islamic Foundation, 1976, p.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[The Muslim Brotherhood]] advocates [[Pan-Islamism|pan-Islamic]] unity and implementing [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Founder [[Hassan al-Banna]] wrote about the restoration of the Caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Olivier, ''Failure of Islamism,'' Harvard University Press, (1994) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

One transnational group whose ideology is based specifically on restoring the caliphate as a pan-Islamic state is [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] (literally: &quot;party of liberation&quot;). It is particularly strong in Central Asia and Europe and is growing in strength in the Arab world. It is based on the claim that Muslims can prove that [[God]] exists&lt;ref&gt;William Lane Craig, ''[http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/mackie.html Professor Mackie and the Kalam Cosmological Argument]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Qur'an is the word of God.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.harunyaya.com/miracles_of_the_quran_01.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harunyaya.biz/Quran_translation/Quran_translation_index.php] {{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hizb-Ut-Tahrir's stated strategy is a non-violent political and intellectual struggle.

In South-East Asia, groups such as [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] aim to establish a Caliphate stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea, and from the Philippines to Java.

===Views of al-Qaeda===
{{main|al-qaeda}}

[[Al-Qaeda]] has as one of its clearly stated goals the re-establishment of a caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;

===Opposition===
Scholar [[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] writes that &quot;early on, Islamists replace the concept of the caliphate ... with that of the [[amir]].&quot; There were a number of reasons including &quot;that according to the classical authors, a caliph must be a member of the tribe of the Prophet (the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]) ... moreover, caliphs ruled societies that the Islamists do not consider to have been Islamic (the [[Ottoman Empire]]).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Olivier, ''Failure of Islamism,'' Harvard University Press, (1994) p.42-3&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the view of the majority of Islamist groups, as both the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (the largest) and [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] view the Ottoman state as a caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/Article.asp?ID=967&amp;SectionID=91 |title=The Muslim Brotherhood And Copts, Historical Perspective |publisher=Ikhwanweb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bieliauskas |first=Hana |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200704170005 |title=Campus Radicals â Hizb-ut Tahrir |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2007-04-17 |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political system==
===Electing or appointing a Caliph===
[[Fred Donner]], in his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'' (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early Caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this [[shura]], or consultative assembly. Candidates were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone.

This argument is advanced by Sunni Muslims, who believe that Muhammad's companion Abu Bakr was elected by the community and that this was the proper procedure. They further argue that a caliph is ideally chosen by election or community consensus, even though the caliphate soon became a hereditary office, or the prize of the strongest general.

Al-Mawardi has written that the caliph should be [[Quraysh (tribe)|Qurayshi]]. [[Al-Baqillani|Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani]] has said that the leader of the Muslims simply should be from the majority. The founder of the biggest Sunni [[Madh'hab]], Imam [[Abu Hanifa]] also wrote that the Caliph must be chosen by the majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;2muslims&quot;/&gt;

===Sunni belief===
Following the death of Muhammad, a meeting took place at [[Saqifah]]. At that meeting, Abu Bakr was elected caliph by the Muslim community. Sunni Muslims developed the belief that the caliph is a temporal political ruler, appointed to rule within the bounds of Islamic law (Sharia). The job of adjudicating orthodoxy and Islamic law was left to [[Ijtihad|Islamic lawyers]], judiciary, or specialists individually termed as [[Mujtahid]]s and collectively named the [[Ulema]]. Many Muslims call the first four caliphs the Rashidun meaning the Rightly Guided Caliphs, because they are believed to have followed the Qur'an and the [[sunnah]] (example) of Muhammad.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Shi'a belief===
{{Main|Succession to Muhammad|Shia Islam|Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)}}

Shia Muslims believe in the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imamate]], in which the rulers are Imams ''divinely chosen, infallible, and sinless'' from Muhammad's family â [[Ahl al-Bayt]] ''literally &quot;People of the House (of Muhammad)&quot;'' regardless of majority opinion, [[shura]] or election. They claim that before his death, Muhammad had given many indications, in [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]] particularly, that he considered Ali, his cousin and son-in-law, as his successor. As per Twelver/Ithna Ashery Shia ,Ali and his eleven descendants, the twelve Imams, are believed to have been considered, even before their birth, as the only valid Islamic rulers appointed and decreed by God.

{{Main|Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)}}

After these twelve Imams, the potential Caliphs, had passed, and in the absence of the possibility of a government headed by their Imams, some Shi'a believe it was necessary that a system of Shia Islamic government based on [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|Vilayat-e Faqih]] be developed, due to the need for some form of government, where an Islamic jurist or [[faqih]] rules Muslims, suffices. However this idea, developed by the [[Marja]] ([[Ayatollah]]) [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] and established in Iran, is not universally accepted among Shi'as.

Shia group of [[Ismaili]]/ [[Fatimid]]/ [[Dawoodi Bohra]] believe in Imamate principle mentioned above, but they need not be ruler. To safe guard divine authority of Allah the &quot;Din&quot;, from politics of World &quot;Duniya&quot; the 'external World', they have instituted office of [[Dai al-Mutlaq]] even from the era of their 21st Imam [[Taiyab abi al-Qasim|Tayyab]] (1130 AD), under juridiction of [[Arwa al-Sulayhi|Suleyhid Queen]], as Imam was under seclusion. In the twelver shia also many Imams were not ruler ,and they sacrificed much to upheld &quot;Din&quot;.

Take the case of Imam Hasan, After Ali, Imam Hasan was his successor. It is told that there was power struggle between Imam Hasan and Muawwia ,finally agreement reached between them. As Hasan was more interested in safeguarding Islam, he has kept the 'Din' with him and sacrificed Caliphate to Muawwia. One thing is very clear that Imamat need not have power of ruler , but there cannot be two representative of Allah at one moment,hence to have two Imam at a time is ruled out. Even a small organization have clear hierarchy, a clear cut single line of downward delegation, how come the almighty organisation of Allah be governed in anarchy.

{{Off-topic|date=December 2011}}
The same was philosophy of [[Fatimid]], and same being literally followed by [[Dawoodi Bohra]]'s Dai in absence and on behalf of their hidden Imam.This is the result that Bohra have unity amongst them all over the world. There is universal brotherhood amongst them, a same culture, same habits of living, togetherness for the cause of Islam and same time dedication to the land they live. This was the Islam and [[Fatimid]]'s true dream, and the [[Fatimid]]/[[Dawoodi Bohra]] seems champion to this cause.There is quotation from web;

&quot;...All five of us had different nationality passports. 1 Kenyan, 1 British, 1 Yemeni, 1 Indian passport issued in Egypt &amp; another Indian passport issued in Nairobi. The Jordanian Immigration officer did not have to be explained why such a mixed group. He knew &amp; he smilingly made a statement, that was actually a stunner. He jokingly said, âWhy donât you have a Bohra Passport? It will make things so much more easier for you, &amp; us too.â

&quot;....We .. people .. do not have a nation .. treated like a single nationality, do not have a kingdom, but are treated royally.

===Majlis al-Shura: Parliament===
{{Off-topic|date=April 2010}}
{{See also|Majlis al Shura (disambiguation)|Shura|Majlis|Majlis-ash-Shura}}''

Traditional Sunni Islamic lawyers agree that ''shura'', loosely translated as 'consultation of the people', is a function of the caliphate. The [[Majlis al Shura]] (literally ''consultative assembly'') or parliament was a representation of this idea of consultative governance. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Qur'an:

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{cite quran|42|38|expand=no|quote=...those who answer the call of their Lord and establish the prayer, and who conduct their affairs by Shura. [are loved by God]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{cite quran|3|159|expand=no|quote=...consult them (the people) in their affairs. Then when you have taken a decision (from them), put your trust in Allah}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The majlis is also the means to elect a new caliph.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt; Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said that in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis and select a list of candidates for caliph; then the majlis should select a caliph from the list of candidates.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt;

Some modern interpretations of the role of the Majlis al-Shura include those by Islamist author [[Sayyid Qutb]] and [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], the founder of a transnational political movement devoted to the revival of the Caliphate. In an analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur'an, Qutb argued that Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually their representatives) and govern within the general context of God-made laws. [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]] writes that Shura is an important part of &quot;the ruling structure&quot; of the Islamic caliphate &quot;but not one of its pillars,&quot; meaning that its neglect would not make the Caliphate's rule unislamic, hence justifying rebellion. Non-Muslims may serve in the Majlis. Islamists from the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the largest Islamist movement and main opposition in Egypt, argue that in the modern age Shura is [[democracy]] and that Islam and the caliphate system is inherently democratic without any need to conform to western political notions.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Accountability of rulers===
{{Off-topic|date=April 2010}}

Sunni Islamic lawyers have commented on when it is permissible to disobey, [[Impeachment|impeach]] or remove rulers in the Caliphate. This is usually when the rulers are not meeting their obligations to the public under Islam.

Al-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public the people must obey their laws, but a Caliph or ruler who becomes either unjust or severely ineffective must be impeached via the Majlis al-Shura. Similarly, Al-Baghdadi{{Clarify|date=September 2008}} believed that if the rulers do not uphold [[justice]], the ummah via the majlis should warn them, and a Caliph who does not heed the warning can be impeached. [[Al-Juwayni]] argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler who deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that [[oppression]] by a caliph is sufficient grounds for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] stated that the people have an obligation to rebel if the caliph begins to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is ''[[haraam]]'' and those who cannot revolt from inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two [[ayah]]s from the Qur'an to justify this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{cite quran|33|67|end=68|expand=no|quote=...And they (the sinners on [[Islamic view of the Last Judgment|qiyama]]) will say, 'Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and our chiefs, and they misled us from the right path. Our Lord! Give them (the leaders) double the punishment you give us and curse them with a very great curse'...}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Islamic lawyers commented that when the rulers refuse to step down after being impeached through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, if the majority is in agreement they have the option to launch a [[revolution]]. Many noted that this option is to be exercised only after factoring in the potential cost of life.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt;

===Rule of law===
{{Off-topic|date=April 2010}}
{{See also|Sharia|Islamic ethics}}

The following [[hadith]] establishes the principle of [[rule of law]] in relation to [[nepotism]] and accountability&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56, Number 681&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Narrated â[[Aisha]]: The people of Quraish worried about the lady from [[Banu Makhzum|Bani Makhzum]] who had committed theft. They asked, &quot;Who will intercede for her with Allah's Apostle?&quot; Some said, &quot;No one dare to do so except Usama bin Zaid the beloved one to Allah's Apostle.&quot; When Usama spoke about that to Allah's Apostle Allah's Apostle said: &quot;Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connected with Allahâs Prescribed Punishments?&quot; Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, &quot;What destroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Allah's Legal punishment on him. By Allah, if [[Fatimah|Fatima]], the daughter of Muhammad (my daughter) stole, I would cut off her hand.&quot;}}

Various Islamic lawyers, however, place multiple conditions and stipulations on the execution of such a law, making it difficult to implement. For example, the poor cannot be penalized for stealing out of poverty, and during a time of drought in the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun caliphate]], [[capital punishment]] was suspended until the effects of the drought passed.

[[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] later formulated the concept that all classes were subject to the law of the land, and no person is above the law; [[official]]s and private [[citizen]]s alike have a [[duty]] to obey the same law. Furthermore, a [[Qadi]] (Islamic judge) was not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of [[religion]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human skin color|colour]], [[kinship]] or [[prejudice]]. In a number of cases, [[Caliph]]s had to appear before judges as they prepared to render their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Weeramantry|1997|pp=132 &amp; 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Noah Feldman, a law professor at [[Harvard University]], the system of legal scholars and jurists responsible for the [[rule of law]] was replaced by the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Sharia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century:&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite news|author=Noah Feldman|title=Why Shariah?|publisher=New York Times|date=March 16, 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?ei=5070&amp;em=&amp;en=5c1b8de536ce606f&amp;ex=1205812800&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy===
{{Off-topic|date=April 2010}}
{{Main|Islamic economics in the world}}
{{See also|Islamic capitalism|Bayt al-mal}}

During the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution]], the Caliphate understood that real [[incentive]]s were needed to increase [[productivity]] and [[wealth]] and thus enhance [[tax revenue]]s. A social transformation took place as a result of changing land [[ownership]]&lt;ref name=Idrisi&gt;Zohor Idrisi (2005), [http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/AgricultureRevolution2.pdf The Muslim Agricultural Revolution and its influence on Europe], FSTC.&lt;/ref&gt; giving individuals of any [[gender]],&lt;ref&gt;Maya Shatzmiller, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; [[ethnic]] or [[religious]] background the right to buy, sell, [[mortgage law|mortgage]], and [[inheritance|inherit]] land for [[farming]] or any other purpose. Based on the [[Quran]], signatures were required on [[contract]]s for every major [[financial transaction]] concerning [[agriculture]], [[industry]], [[commerce]], and [[employment]]. Copies of the contract were usually kept by both parties involved.&lt;ref name=Idrisi/&gt;

There are similarities between Islamic economics and [[leftist]] or [[socialist]] economic policies. Islamic jurists have argued that privatization of the origin of oil, gas, and other fire-producing fuels, agricultural land, and water is forbidden. The principle of public or joint ownership has been drawn by Muslim jurists from the following [[hadith]] of the Prophet of Islam:

[[Ibn Abbas]] reported that the Messenger of Allah said: ''&quot;All Muslims are partners in three things- in water, herbage and fire.&quot;'' (Narrated in Abu Daud, &amp; Ibn Majah)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaudhry|first=Muhammad Sharif|title=Fundamentals of Islamic Economic System: Public Ownership|url=http://www.muslimtents.com/shaufi/b16/b16_19.htm#II-%20Public%20Ownership|work=MuslimTents.com|accessdate=9 December 2010|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anas added to the above hadith, ''&quot;Its price is Haram (forbidden).&quot;''{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Jurists have argued by [[qiyas]] that the above restriction on privatization can be extended to all essential resources that benefit the community as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Aside from similarities to socialism, early forms of proto-[[capitalism]] and [[free market]]s were present in the Caliphate,&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge economic history of Europe'', p. 437.

The concepts of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and [[pension]] were introduced in early [[Sharia|Islamic law]] as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliph]] [[Umar]] in the 7th century. The [[tax]]es (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] (''[[Bayt al-mal]]'') of an Islamic [[government]] were used to provide [[income]] for the [[needy]], including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]s, and the [[Disability|disabled]]. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058â1111), the government was also expected to stockpile food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurred.

The [[demographics]] of medieval Islamic society varied in some significant aspects from other agricultural societies, including a decline in [[birth rate]]s as well as a change in [[life expectancy]]. Other traditional agrarian societies are estimated to have had an average life expectancy of 20 to 25 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Shatzmiller|first=Maya|year=1994|title=Labour in the Medieval Islamic World|pages=63â4 &amp; 66|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=90-04-09896-8|quote=At the same time, the âdemographic behaviourâ of the Islamic society as an agricultural society varied in some significant aspects from other agricultural societies, particularly in ways which could explain a decline in birth rate. It is agreed that all agricultural societies conform to a given demographic pattern of behaviour, which includes a high birth-rate and a slightly lower death-rate, significant enough to allow a slow population increase of 0.5 to 1.0 per cent per year. Other demographic characteristics of this society are high infant mortality, with 200â500 deaths per 1000 within the first year of birth, a lower average life expectancy, of twenty to twenty-five years, and a broadly based population pyramid, where the number of young people at the bottom of the pyramid is very high in relationship to the rest of the population, and that children are set to work at an early stage. Islamic society diverged from this demographic profile in some significant points, although not always consistently. Studies have shown that during certain periods, such factors as attitudes to marriage and sex, birth control, birth and death rates, age of marriage and patterns of marriage, family size and migration pattems, varied from the traditional agricultural model. [...] Life expectancy was another area where Islamic society diverged from the suggested model for agricultural society.}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] are estimated at 20 to 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Life expectancy (sociology)|work=[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-340119/life-expectancy|accessdate=2010-04-17|quote=In ancient Rome and medieval Europe the average life span is estimated to have been between 20 and 30 years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy of Islamic society diverged from that of other traditional agrarian societies, with several studies on the lifespans of [[Ulema|Islamic scholars]] concluding that members of this occupational group enjoyed a life expectancy between 69 and 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Shatzmiller|first=Maya|year=1994|title=Labour in the Medieval Islamic World|page=66|publisher=Brill Publishers|isbn=90-04-09896-8|quote=Life expectancy was another area where Islamic society diverged from the suggested model for agricultural society.

The early Islamic Empire also had the highest literacy rates among pre-modern societies, alongside the city of [[classical Athens]] in the 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Delivering Education|author=Andrew J. Coulson|page=117|publisher=[[Hoover Institution]]|url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817928928_105.pdf|accessdate=2008-11-22|quote=Reaching further back through the centuries, the civilizations regarded as having the highest literacy rates of their ages were parent-driven educational marketplaces. The ability to read and write was far more widely enjoyed in the early medieval Islamic empire and in fourth-century-B.C.E. Athens than in any other cultures of their times.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, [[China]] after the introduction of [[printing]] from the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165â186 [177â8]|quote=The spread of written knowledge was at least the equal of what it was in China after printing became common there in the tenth century. (We should note that Chinese books were printed in small editions of a hundred or so copies.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; One factor for the relatively high literacy rates in the early Islamic Empire was its parent-driven educational marketplace, as the state did not systematically subsidize educational services until the introduction of state funding under [[Nizam al-Mulk]] in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Delivering Education|author=Andrew J. Coulson|page=117|publisher=[[Hoover Institution]]|url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817928928_105.pdf|accessdate=2008-11-22|quote=In neither case did the state supply or even systematically subsidize educational services. The Muslim worldâs eventual introduction of state funding under Nizam al-Mulk in the eleventh century was quickly followed by partisan religious squabbling over education and the gradual fall of Islam from its place of cultural and scientific preeminence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor was the diffusion of [[paper]] from China,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165â186 [177]|quote=According to legend, paper came to the Islamic world as a result of the capture of Chinese paper makers at the 751 C.E. battle of Talas River.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to an efflorescence of books and written culture in Islamic society, thus [[papermaking]] technology transformed Islamic society (and later, the rest of [[Afro-Eurasia]]) from an [[Speech|oral]] to [[Scribe|scribal]] culture, comparable to the later shifts from scribal to [[Typography|typographic]] culture, and from typographic culture to the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165â186 [177]|quote=Whatever the source, the diffusion of paper-making technology via the lands of Islam produced a shift from oral to scribal culture across the rest of Afroeurasia that was rivaled only by the move from scribal to typographic culture. (Perhaps it will prove to have been even more important than the recent move from typographic culture to the Internet.) The result was remarkable. As historian Jonathan Bloom informs us, paper encouraged &quot;an efflorescence of books and written culture incomparably more brilliant than was known anywhere in Europe until the invention of printing with movable type in the fifteenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors include the widespread use of paper [[book]]s in Islamic society (more so than any other previously existing society), the study [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|and memorization]] of the [[Qur'an]], flourishing [[Islamic economics in the world|commercial activity]], and the emergence of the [[Maktab]] and [[Madrasah]] educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165â186 [178]|quote=More so than any previously existing society, Islamic society of the period 1000â1500 was profoundly a culture of books. [...] The emergence of a culture of books is closely tied to cultural dispositions toward literacy in Islamic societies. Muslim young men were encouraged to memorize the Qur'an as part of their transition to adulthood, and while most presumably did not (though little is known about literacy levels in pre-Mongol Muslim societies), others did. Types of literacy in any event varied, as Nelly Hanna has recently suggested, and are best studied as part of the complex social dynamics and contexts of individual Muslim societies. The need to conform commercial contracts and business arrangements to Islamic law provided a further impetus for literacy, especially likely in commercial centers. Scholars often engaged in commercial activity and craftsmen or tradesmen often spent time studying in madrasas. The connection between what Brian Street has called &quot;maktab literacy&quot; and commercial literacy was real and exerted a steady pressure on individuals to upgrade their reading skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
