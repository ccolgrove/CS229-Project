'''Michael McDonald''' (born February 12, 1952) is a five-time [[Grammy Award]] winning [[United States|American]]  [[singer]] and [[songwriter]]. McDonald is known for a soulful [[baritone]] singing style and a multi-octave range. He began his career singing back-up vocals with [[Steely Dan]]. He became a member of the [[Doobie Brothers]] from 1976 to 1981, a period which resulted in several hit songs for the band.

==Early years==
Born in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], McDonald played in several local bands (such as Mike and the Majestics, Jerry Jay and the Sheratons, the Reeb-Toors, the Del Rays and The Guild) while attending [[McCluer High School]] in his hometown of [[Ferguson, Missouri]], now a city of some 25,000 people in St. Louis County, Missouri. McDonald was discovered while playing with a group called Blue and consequently moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1970.

==Steely Dan==
Michael McDonald became one of the many in-studio adjunct members of the group [[Steely Dan]], providing back-up vocals on tracks for 1975's ''[[Katy Lied]]''. He would return on subsequent Steely Dan recordings including 1976's ''[[The Royal Scam]]'' and 1977's ''[[Aja (album)|Aja]]''. He also played keyboards on some Steely Dan tracks. McDonald continued to do background vocals for Steely Dan through their 1980 release, ''[[Gaucho (album)|Gaucho]]''. He was part of Steely Dan's last touring band in the 1970s, playing keyboards and singing backup.

==Doobie Brothers==
McDonald was recruited by the band [[The Doobie Brothers]] in April 1975 when lead singer [[Tom Johnston (musician)|Tom Johnston]] became ill during a national tour. His time with the band proved so successful that they decided to retain him as a full time member.

As a member of the Doobie Brothers he recorded some of his best-known songs such as &quot;Real Love&quot;, &quot;Takin' It to the Streets&quot;, &quot;Little Darling&quot;, &quot;It Keeps You Runnin'&quot;, &quot;[[Minute by Minute]]&quot; and &quot;[[What a Fool Believes]]&quot; (which became a number one single in the U.S. and earned him a 1980 [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] along with co-writer [[Kenny Loggins]]). At the same time he appeared as a session singer and piano player for artists such as [[Christopher Cross]], [[Stephen Bishop]],  [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], the rock band [[Toto (band)|Toto]] and [[Kenny Loggins]].

After the Doobies' first farewell tour, McDonald compiled some of his earlier songs in the 1982 release ''That Was Then: The Early Years'' which has never been issued on CD. His first solo album, ''[[If That's What It Takes (Michael McDonald album)|If That's What It Takes]],'' also released in 1982, featured the hits &quot;[[I Keep Forgettin' (We're Not in Love Anymore)]],&quot; a duet with his sisters Kathy and Maureen, and &quot;I Gotta Try,&quot; a song co-written with [[Kenny Loggins]], who recorded it as well. 

McDonald co-wrote [[Van Halen]]'s Top 20 hit &quot;[[I'll Wait]]&quot;, from their landmark ''[[1984 (Van Halen album)|1984]]'' album. McDonald co-wrote &quot;[[You Belong to Me (The Doobie Brothers song)|You Belong to Me]]&quot; with [[Carly Simon]].

&quot;[[Yah Mo B There]]&quot;, a duet with [[James Ingram]], won the [[Grammy Awards of 1985|1985 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&amp;winner=Michael%20McDonald&amp;year=0&amp;genreID=0&amp;hp=1 |title=â Grammy winners |publisher=Grammy.com |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He followed that up with &quot;[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]&quot;, a duet with [[Patti Labelle]], which reached #1 on the U.S. charts in 1986. Also in 1987 McDonald did a featured collaboration with American gospel group [[The Winans]] from their ''Decisions'' album:  &quot;Love has no color&quot;. That same year he performed the single &quot;Sweet Freedom&quot; that appeared on that summer's hit movie ''[[Running Scared (1986 film)|Running Scared]]'' soundtrack.

McDonald's 1990 album ''Take It to Heart'' featured a minor hit with the title song, co-written with [[Diane Warren]].

In 2003, he earned two Grammy nominations for his album ''[[Motown (Michael McDonald album)|Motown]],'' a tribute to the [[Motown Records|Motown sound]].

In 2008 McDonald released his ''SoulSpeak'' album which (in addition to including three new songs penned by McDonald) featured his interpretations of 11 carefully selected soul-inspired songs. Ranging from universal evergreens like Dionne Warwick's &quot;Walk On By&quot; and Stevie Wonder's &quot;Living For The City&quot; to lesser-known numbers like Van Morrison's atmospheric &quot;Into The Mystic&quot; and the late 60s Chicago soul of Tyrone Davis' &quot;Baby Can I Change My Mind&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/262/michael_mcdonald_speaks_from_the_soul/ |title=Michael McDonald interview by Pete Lewis, '&amp;#39;Blues &amp; Soul'&amp;#39;, April 2008 |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
A fictionalized version of McDonald (portrayed by actor [[JD Ryznar]]), and other popular singers and band members of the 1970s and 1980s appeared in the online [[Channel 101]] video series [[Yacht Rock]], a parody of the &quot;smooth music&quot; of the period. The fictionalized McDonald and songwriting partner Kenny Loggins were at the center of nearly all the episodes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

McDonald was parodied in a [[Second City Television]] skit in the early 1980s, where he is portrayed by [[Rick Moranis]] and is seen driving at speed through the streets in order to reach a recording studio to record his part as a back up singer for the [[Christopher Cross]] track &quot;[[Ride Like the Wind]]&quot;. McDonald was in high demand as a backing vocal artist at the time, and would travel from studio to studio completing these requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDojwQ8cJC4 |title=SCTV 3 Gerry Todd and Michael McDonald |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McDonald and his ''[[Soundstage (TV series)|Soundstage]]'' concert were referenced numerous times in the movie ''[[The 40-Year-Old Virgin]]'', where the electronics store manager insists on incessantly playing McDonald's DVD concert in store.

In an [[Padre de Familia|episode]] of [[Family Guy]], McDonald is shown being hired to briefly perform backing vocals for everything Peter and other characters are saying.

In a sketch on [[Late Night With Conan O'Brien]], McDonald is parodied as a camp counselor who sings to children rather than talking to them.

==Personal life==
McDonald has been married to singer [[Amy Holland]] since 1983. They have two children: a son named Dylan (after Bob) and a daughter named Scarlet (after Mike's mother).
