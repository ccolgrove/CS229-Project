'''Rede Globo''' ({{IPA-pt|ËÊedÊi ËÉ¡lobu}}, ''Globe Network''), or simply '''Globo''', is a [[Brazil]]ian [[Television broadcasting|television network]], launched by [[media mogul]] [[Roberto Marinho]] on April 26, 1965. It is owned by media conglomerate [[OrganizaÃ§Ãµes Globo]], being by far the largest of its holdings. Globo is the fourth-largest public TV commercial network in the world and one of the largest producer of soap operas.&lt;ref name=&quot;MBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=BRAZIL - The Museum of Broadcast Corporations |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=brazil |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globo is headquartered in the [[Jardim BotÃ¢nico, Rio de Janeiro|Jardim BotÃ¢nico]] neighborhood of [[Rio de Janeiro]], where its news division is based. The network's main production studios are located at a complex dubbed ''[[Projac]]'' (short for &quot;JacarepaguÃ¡ project&quot;), located in [[Barra da Tijuca|JacarepaguÃ¡, Barra da Tijuca]]. It is composed of 122 owned and affiliate [[television stations]] throughout [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{pt}} [http://donosdamidia.com.br/rede/4023 About Rede Globo in the study ''Media owners''].&lt;/ref&gt; plus its own international networks, TV Globo Internacional  and TV Globo Portugal. In 2007, Globo moved its [[Analog television|analog operations]] to [[high-definition television]] production for [[digital broadcasting]].

==History==
===Early years===
In July 1957, [[President of Brazil|Brazilian President]] [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] gave his approval to Radio Globo's request for opening a television channel. On December 30, 1957, the National Council of Telecommunication made public a decree which granted the channel four frequency in [[Rio de Janeiro]] to TV Globo Ltda. Globo then started preparing the beginning of its television broadcasting operations.

In 1962, a controversial agreement between [[Time-Life]] and [[OrganizaÃ§Ãµes Globo]], [[Roberto Marinho]]'s holding company, gave Marinho access to a sum of over 6 million [[US dollar|dollars]] with which he would buy equipment and build an infra-structure for Globo to begin its television service. In return, Time-Life would be entitled to 30% of all profits from Globo's TV operations. As a matter of comparison, the largest TV station in Brazil at the time, [[TV Tupi]], had been built with a sum of 300,000 dollars when it was launched in 1950. Tupi was the first television network in Brazil and Latin America, which would become one of Globo's main competitors until its closure in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helena Sousa&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last = Sousa | first = Helena | title = The re-export of the US commercial television model time-life/Globo/SIC: replicating business strategies? | pages = 1â15 | publisher = Minho University | date = 1998-07 | url = http://www.bocc.ubi.pt/pag/sousa-helena-globo-sic.pdf | accessdate = 2007-11-17 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was widely seen as illegal, as then [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian constitution]] prohibited any foreign person or company from owning interests in a Brazilian media company. In trying to address the legal aspects, the agreement specifically mentioned that its terms did not give Time-Life the right to share or interfere in the management of Globo's operations. In practice Time-Life wielded great influence inside Globo; Joseph Wallach, the former director of Time-Life's TV station in California, became Globo's de facto executive director and Marinho's assistant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helena Sousa&quot; /&gt;

On April 1, 1964 a year before Rede Globo was opened, a [[1964 Brazilian coup d'Ã©tat|military-led coup]] deposed the elected government of President [[JoÃ£o Goulart]]. As the military reduced the democratic institutions of Brazil, it simultaneously sought to increase its hold over the media, especially the major conglomerates. At the time, Marinho had been a supporter of the coup, but his deal with Time-Life was still being investigated by congress. The military decided against the deal, which ultimately allowed Marinho to get out of the deal under exceptional terms. In 1969, Marinho terminated the deal with Time-Life by agreeing to pay back the 6 million dollars invested.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This in effect meant that Marinho could repay the infra-structure provided by Time-Life and would no longer have the obligation to share 30% of Globo's profit with Time-Life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helena Sousa&quot; /&gt;

Globo began its broadcast on April 26, 1965 in Rio de Janeiro, then broadcasting on channel four. On that day, at about 10:45 a.m., Rubens Amaral formally introduced Rede Globo to viewers in Rio de Janeiro and all over [[Guanabara State]], before &quot;[[Moon River]]&quot; by [[Henry Mancini]] was sung. By May 2 that year, its longest running and oldest program, the live telecast of the [[Holy Mass]] was seen for the first time. On the following year, Globo purchased another television station, SÃ£o Paulo-based [[TV Paulista]], expanding its operations, and beginning to take over the national television ratings. By January 1966, at the height of flooding in Rio, Globo broadcast its first major news coverage.

1968 was the year when its branch station in [[Belo Horizonte]], Rede Globo Minas, was launched, as well as the very first microwave broadcasts between Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo. Another trademark for the network was ''[[Jornal da Globo]]'', successor to ''Ultranoticias'' (1966â67), and the network's main newscast until 1969. It had a broadcast time of 15 minutes, and was then hosted by Hilton Gomez and Luis Jatoba.

In 1967, Globo began to build its national network with the affiliation of [[Porto Alegre]]-based TV GaÃºcha (now [[RBS TV]]). TV GaÃºcha would become Globo's affiliate on [[Florianopolis]] in the late 1970s, when it received its current name. It is one of Globo's oldest affiliates, active since 1962, three years before Globo was launched. [[UberlÃ¢ndia]]'s TV TriÃ¢ngulo (currently Rede IntegraÃ§Ã£o), and [[GoiÃ¢nia]]'s TV Anhanguera (now Rede Anhanguera) soon followed in 1967 and 1968. The now extinct TV GuajarÃ¡, based in [[BelÃ©m]], was launched in 1969, followed by TV Verdes Mares on January of the following year, although it began its test broadcasts on 1969.

===Jornal Nacional and the climb to full leadership of Brazilian television (1969â80)===
====JN, Jornal Hoje and the Plim-plim signal====
On September 1, 1969, the country and national television broadcasting was changed with the premiere of ''[[Jornal Nacional]]'' (''National Journal''), the nation's first live newscast anchored by Cid Moreira and Hilton Gomez. Its theme music, &quot;The Fuzz&quot; by [[Frank DeVol]], became one of the show's trademarks, together with the program logo and the &quot;Boa Noite&quot; greeting by the hosts. Its success was followed by the launch of [[Jornal Hoje]] (''Journal Today'') on April 21, 1971, the day when its [[Brasilia]] station (Rede Globo BrasÃ­lia, Channel 10) was inaugurated. The program was then only shown in Rede Globo Rio de Janeiro (Channel 4), the flagship station, until 1974 when it became a nationwide midday newscast. It had its first [[FIFA World Cup]] broadcast in 1970, the same year when Rede Exclesior was closed down, with the network absorbing some of its talents and top management. The network's famous '''Plim-Plim''' interval signal also debuted that year.

It began color television broadcasts in February 1972 on a national scale, the same year as [[Rede Bandeirantes]] did convert television broadcasts to color and 10 years after the first color telecasts in the country was launched by Rede Excelsior (and also the same year as the opening of its Recife station, Rede Globo Recife Channel 13, now Rede Globo Nordeste, on April 22), with the national color broadcasts being debuted on March 31 the same year as the ''Meu Primeiro Baile'' episode of Caso Especial, its teletheater show, which is the first color integrated program on national television was shown on the network.

Before that, it launched its famous [[Christmas]] and [[New Year]] holiday campaign, A Festa Ã© Sua, in November 1971. The campaign's theme song, &quot;Um Novo Tempo&quot;, is still used during its year-end station campaign plugs and identifications since then. It is also one of Brazil's great Christmas holiday songs.  It was the same year on March 16 when the late-night edition of ''Jornal Nacional'' (called ''Jornal Nacional-Segunda EdiÃ§Ã£o'', ''National Journal Second Edition''), hosted by Fabbio Perez and Ronan Soares, began broadcasting the entire day's headlines until 1982. Its 15-minute international version, ''Jornal Internacional'' (''International Journal''), anchored by Jorge Pontual and Sandra Passarinho, began airing in April 1972, lasting until 1975. It originally ran for 20 minutes during its first two years. It was replaced in 1975 by ''Amanha'' (Tomorrow), the network's local news roundup at late nights.
Perez and Fabio Castilho hosted it until 1979.

1973 saw the birth of two new programs on the network, the documentary program ''[[Globo RepÃ³rter]]'' (formerly the Globo Shell Specials which ran from 1971 to 1973), hosted by Sergio Chapelin, and [[FantÃ¡stico]] (FantÃ¡stico: O Show Da Vida, ''It's Fantastic: The Show of Life'' from 1974â79), then the network's weekly variety program from 1974 to 1993 when it became the network's weekly [[newsmagazine]] broadcast on Sundays, recognizable through its theme music and from 1973 to 1995, its ballet dancers. Cid Moreira anchored it until 1988, joined by Chapelin during its early days (Moreira is presently the program's special segment host since 1998). When the former's hosting duties expired in 1988, William Bonner (presently one of Jornal Nacional's anchors), Valeria Monteiro, Mario Vasconcellos, who became the titular host, then program commentator Alexandre Garcia and Wagner Montes joined the program, joined by Chapelin and Jornal da Globo's Lelia Cordeiro, who served in the show for three years since 1985. Leo Batista, the longest program anchor from 1973 to 2007, served as the show's sports segment host, while Chico Anysio served as both humorist and commentator until 1992. ''Esporte Espectacular'' (Spectacular Sports), the network's first sports newscast, broadcast until today on Sundays, debuted on March that year. It would last a decade, and was relaunched in 1987.

On April 26 the next year (1974), it broadcast in full color for the first time, with all its stations converting to full color broadcasts until 1977, and the entire network system was beginning to broadcast via satellite in 1982, five years after.

The next year, when Globo turned 10, it rebroadcast ''Selva de Pedra'' because of the cancellation of its newest drama, ''Roque Santeiro'', by the federal government, only to air a decade later. Its ''Sessao da Tarde'' afternoon film banner was launched also in 1975, and its ''Caso Especial'' teletheater program was also shown from April to December the same year, on a weekly basis.

====A New Corporate Image====
1976 saw the beginning of the network's scheduling process (the PadrÃ£o Globo da Qualidade), which consists of two soap operas followed with newscasts, Globo Reporter and one to two more drama shows or cinema, comedy programming and others after. The process was led by Walter Clark and Jose Bonifacio de Olivera Sobrinho in 1960, when Rede Excelsior was launched (the process was inherited by Rede Globo upon Excelsior's closure in 1970). It rose the network to full audience leadership in the late 1970s, gaining more ratings and clinching the top spot in Brazilian television.

This was also the reason why Silvio Santos, one of the network's original variety show presenters since 1965, backed out of Globo, and moved his 23-year old program (Programa Silvio Santos, ''The Silvio Santos Program'') to [[Rede Tupi]], while putting up his own network, TVS (now [[Sistema Brasileiro de TelevisÃ£o|SBT]]) in the process the next year, even bringing his own show there. By in the process, it would also continue the first nationwide variety show telecast that Globo had since 1966, and ten years later was also broadcast on SÃ£o Paulo's [[Rede Record]] until 1987, not just on Rede Tupi until 1980 and of course, on TVS, presently [[Sistema Brasileiro de Televisao]] until today.

Its humor and comedy program, [[Os TrapalhÃµes]], began the next year, continuing until 1995, together with the network's morning news program, ''Bom Dia SÃ£o Paulo'' (Good Morning SÃ£o Paulo), which four years later would have a national version. 1976 would also be the first time its present insignia was shown: it was created by Hans Donner, and was a colored blue sphere with a TV-shaped box with another blue ball inside. Donner also created the network's first presentation package with the new logo for the first time. That year also was the premiere of SÃ­tio do Picapau Amarelo ([[Yellow Woodpecker Ranch]]), one of the network's famous children's series. Its first version ran until 1986, its second version was aired from 2001 to 2007.

The network's second FIFA World Cup telecast after its first ([[FIFA World Cup 1978]]) happened the following year (1978), followed by the premiere telecast of ''Globo Esporte'' (Globo Sports), the network's daily sports newscast, presently still airing before Jornal Hoje, then anchored by Luciano do Valle. Also that year, Caso Especial ended its first phrase of broadcasts (it would continue until 1995, under various names), and was replaced by another teletheater program, Aplauso (Applause).

The decade was closed with the premiere of the ''Domingo Maior'' (Best Sunday) film block, one of the new programs Globo made for Sundays, and the revival of Jornal da Globo in 1979 after a ten-year absence (it lasted until 1981), plus the ''Jornal das Sete'' (News at Seven) local newscasts of 1979-83, precursor to the network's local news programs of today. Jornal da Globo then was anchored by Sergio Chapelin and was aired after JN Second Edition, and now had a running time of 30 minutes.

===At the top: Globo in a changing era of Brazilian television (1980â92)===
As Rede Globo marked its 15th year of broadcasts in 1980-81, it had two major events in its sleeve. Since 1980 was the year that [[Rede Tupi]] shut down its operations, it surprised many former Tupi viewers and supporters with its anniversary programs. Two of them was the Festival 15 Anos (15 Years Festival) which showcased the best drama programs of the last 15 years, and the [[Os TrapalhÃµes]] marathon, which gave itself to charitable activities for 8 long hours. It proved to many Brazilians how the network was proving well as the now audience leader in Brazilian television. Aside from it, its ''Vale a Pena Ver de Novo'' (It's Worth Watching Once Again) afternoon drama block debuted on May 5 that year. ''Globo Rural'', its rural newscast also debuted in the same year, with Carlos Nascimento as its first presenter. By then, it was broadcast weekly, on Sundays.

====More Surprises and Shows====
Aside from its [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] coverage two years after, the network premiered the children's show Balao Magico (Magic Balloon), which ran from 1982 to 1986. It was anchored by the children's musical group [[Turma do BalÃ£o Magico]], whose music struck a chord with its viewers.
1982 also saw the Jornal da Globo relaunch in August, after two successive editions. The presenters then were Renato Machado, Belisa Ribeiro and Luciana Villas Boas, with Carlos Monforte as program commentator.

1983 saw the birth of another network hit: [[VÃ­deo Show]], successfully airing till today. Its first program host was Tassia Camargo. The network's daily electronic magazine show (formerly a weekly program from 1983â94), it gives an inside look of the network's programs and includes bloopers, interviews and even a look into Globo's historical moments. Bonner, Chico Pinheiro and Malu Mader were some of the program's early co-hosts. It also had its SOS Nordeste (SOS Northeast) campaign which debuted that year led by Renato Aragao of Os TrapalhÃµes, lasting until 1986.

Also debuting that year were the ''PraÃ§a TV'' local newscasts, aired twice a day and the national version of the network's SÃ£o Paulo morning newstcast, ''Bom Dia Brasil'' (Good Morning Brazil), with Carlos Monforte as its first anchor, by then based in Globo's BrasÃ­lia studios until 1996. By then it had two editions, only broadcasted in full then in Globo's Recife, Brasilia and Belo Horizonte stations because SÃ£o Paulo (From 1977â) and Rio de Janeiro (1983â84, 1989â) had their own local editions of the newscast.

In 1984, it not only premiered its ''Supercine'' film slot (which is aired on Saturdays), it extended PraÃ§a TV to late night as a result of the Jornal da Globo relaunch of 1982. Lasting until 1990, the 10-minute ''PraÃ§a TV Terceira EdiÃ§Ã£o'' (PraÃ§a TV Third Edition) gave its affiliated stations the chance to recap the day's local news in their own networks after Jornal da Globo was aired. By then, Eliakim Araujo and Liliana Rodriguez (later replaced by Leilane Neubarth in 1984) had become its presenters, and even had Jo Soares as humorist until he moved to SBT in 1988. Also premiering was Praca TV Sunday Editions, lasting until June 1987, which highlighted the news stories of the day and served as Fantastico's preview show in the midday and early evening editions.

It was also the year of the [[Diretas JÃ¡]] (Direct Elections Now) campaign in some Brazilian cities from March 1983 to April 1984, in which Jornal Nacional had a mistake in carrying news about the campaign's progress.

===1985â89: Globo at 20, Countdown to 25===
For Globo, 1985 was its 20th anniversary year, full of new programming and more surprises. That year was one of the best years ever for the channel, for various reasons. One of them was the Festival 20 Anos (''Festival of 20 Years'') showcase of previous soap operas aired on the network. Other surprises include the record breaking final episode of Roque Santeiro, then its rating-topping series, which in March, after a 10-year absence was finally shown on Rede Globo, and the debut of ''Corujao'', its programming-ending block of films for all Brazilians, especially the older citizens, now rejoiced by the end of the country's military rule of 21 years. Since it's the last program before sign-off except for some days, films rated for adults are shown here, followed by the network's sign-off plug, showing the next day's programming. SOS Nordeste ended its run that year, and the network formally announced its replacement, the Crianca Esperanca (Children's Hope) charity telethon, to be aired the next year.

1986 was the very year when [[Xuxa Meneghel]]'s own show,'' Xou da Xuxa (Xuxa's Show)'' debuted on Rede Globo after three years in [[Rede Manchete]]'s children's program Clube da CrianÃ§a, replacing the succeessful Sitio do Picapau Amarelo as a result. It was a hit among its viewers, airing all week (from Mondays to Saturdays) for seven years until 1993. That year was also the 20th anniversary of Os TrapalhÃµes, which lasted until 1987. The network's other big program was its coverage of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], plus the first telecast of the CrianÃ§a EsperanÃ§a children's charity show, which Renato AragÃ£o (of Os TrapalhÃµes) hosted. This first show was directed by Victor Paranhos, and was produced by Walter Lacet.

It was also when the network's corporate arms evolved into the present day design, it was then two silver balls with a rainbow-colored box inside. The logo was renovated several times in the years that followed.

Two years later, Vale Tudo, one of Brazilian television's best dramas, premiered on Rede Globo, followed by its Tela Quente weekly film block, aired on Mondays.

On March 26, 1989, the network's own Sunday variety program, [[Domingao do Faustao]] (Faustao's Sunday) was launched as the network started to take over the Sunday afternoon TV ratings, then led by SBT's Programa Silvio Santos. Still airing on Sunday afternoons and evenings before Fantastico, Fausto Silva is the program's titular host. Another newcomer was the Temperatura Maxima film block, presently airing on Sundays since 1990 (originally it was aired on Wednesdays). Within the year, so many series and programs premiered on the network and were aired until 1990, but the news programs got a makeover and change of presenters, especially the main newscasts and Praca TV.

Even Jornal Nacional and Jornal da Globo got makeovers and hosting changes, the former got its present version of The Fuzz plus a new studio coupled with the return of Sergio Chapelin to the program as co-presenter while JG had a change of anchors with the departure to [[Rede Manchete]] of Eliakim Araujo and Leila Cordeiro, its then anchors, leaving behind co-anchor Leilane Neubarth. All three presenters were replaced by William Bonner and RBS TV's Fatima Bernardes (the latter had already replaced Cordeiro when she moved to Jornal Hoje), becoming their first team-up in a Globo newscast since March that year, when Bernardes joined Fantastico along with Fausto Silva, becoming one of its co-hosts along with Bonner, Chapelin and others plus Chico Anysio, one of the original presenters. Bonner soon took over as Jornal Hoje principal anchor(replacing Cordeiro) and joined Jornal Nacional as one of the substitute presenters while Fatima stayed with Fantastico until the mid-1990s. They were to be married in 1993, several years after Eliakim and Leila's own wedding.

The year ended with hope that next year, the 40th year of Brazilian TV and Globo's 25th anniversary year, will be one of the best years that Globo has ever seen, as shown in their year-end campaign video commemorating its 25th year, in which most of the network's artists, program presenters and newscasters performed its 25th anniversary theme.

===1990: Globo at 25, scoring unbeatable at 100===
1990 was the year when Globo turned 25 years old. But still it began to defend its lead on the national TV ratings. Some of its shows and programs debuted that same year, together with its anniversary presentation Festival 25 Anos (25 Years Festival) of replayed telecasts of all its best programs in the past 25 years were:

* Escolinha do Professor Raimundo (weekday afternoons)
* Araponga
* A Rainha da Sucata

TV Pirata ended its run that year, because of the loss of the post JN program slot ratings to Rede Manchete's [[Pantanal]] drama series, then aired on weekdays from 9:30 to 10:30 in the evening,and was reinstated in 1991. It also broadcast the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] that same year, and also covered the 1990 congressional elections for the National Congress of Brazil.

===1991â1994: The Countdown to 30 and Globosat Networks===
1991 saw the birth of Globosat, Globo Organization's own cable service in which Rede Globo was a part of. By then, it had only 4 channels, compared with more than 20 channels today. Another big surprise also came that year in the form of ''O Dono do Mundo'', another of its top record dramas, plus ''Vamp'', its highly successful 7 P.M. soap, which would later become a Latin American hit. Plantao JN, Globo's own breaking news service was relaunched into Plantao da Globo that year.

By the next year, President Collor's impeachment trials and the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were all covered by Rede Globo's news and sports teams.

On December 31, 1992, Xuxa declared the end of her show's long run. Globo replaced it with ''TV Colosso'', the all-marionette hosted show that continued the network's long successes with child-friendly programming. It ran until 1997.

Globo has since expanded to become the largest TV Network in Brazil, with over $2 billion dollars in revenue in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Helena Sousa&quot; /&gt; It is famous for the [[telenovela]]s ([[soap opera]]s) which, together with the news and football, dominate prime time viewing in Brazil. These are exported to several countries, to both Portuguese-speaking countries and elsewhere, where they are dubbed into local languages, rose to popularity, and make profits to the broadcasting stations.

Globo is the first Brazilian network to have its own news channel, [[Globo News]], in 1996. Now based in SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the main headquarters, it not only broadcasts replays of Globo's news programs, but has its own news programs and commentaries.
It also began its very own international broadcasting service, Rede Globo International (Rede Globo Internacional, now TV Globo International), in 1999. It now reaches more countries worldwide, especially the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-speaking nations outside Brazil, including Portugal itself where the network has its own overseas station.

===2000s: loss of interest in telenovelas===
The [[IBOPE]] ratings of SÃ£o Paulo metropolitan area shows that Globo telenovelas has lost, between 2004 and 2008, 26,2% of viewership, although Globo is still the leader network. Its previous 9 p.m. telenovela, ''Viver a Vida'', had an average share of 35.7, an all-time low for Globo. Telenovelas in the 1980s easily reached over 50 present, Vale Tudo and O Fantastico mundo de Nanda being notable examples.

===Corporate Logos===
Globo has used several logos throughout its history.&lt;ref name=&quot;OrganizaÃ§Ãµes Globo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title = Rede Globo Institutional | publisher = OrganizaÃ§Ãµes Globo | language = Brazilian Portuguese | url = http://redeglobo.globo.com/TVG/0,,9648,00.html | accessdate = 2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of the current logo design debuted in 1976, a blue ball with a television shaped box in the middle, with another ball inside it. The second version of the current logo debuted in 1986, now with the two balls being silver, and the inside being rainbow colored. Most of Globo's modern logos have been minor variations of this design. Hans Donner designed the current logo and presentation packages used by Globo, in both 2008 and 2009. These include interprogram idents and even an enhanced Plim-Plim interval ident.

====Anniversary Logos====
Every 5 years or so, a special logo is made the commemorate the network's anniversaries.

Globo is broadcast in metropolitan areas through a number of [[owned-and-operated station]]s including [[Globo Network Rio de Janeiro|Globo-RJ]] ([[Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Globo Network SÃ£o Paulo|Globo-SP]] ([[SÃ£o Paulo]]), [[Globo Network BrasÃ­lia|Globo-DF]] ([[BrasÃ­lia]]), [[Globo Network Belo Horizonte|Globo-MG]] ([[Belo Horizonte]]), [[Globo Network Nordeste|Globo-NE]] ([[Recife]]).

The Rede Globo covers 98,53% of the territory of [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OrganizaÃ§Ãµes Globo&quot; /&gt;

===International Distribution===
TV Globo Internacional (Globo International Network) operates [[satellite television]] channels around the world, including in the [[Americas]], [[Oceania]] (specifically [[Australia]]), [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[Japan]], bringing a mix of entertainment, news and sports programming sourced from TV Globo, [[GNT]], [[Globo News]], [[Canal Viva]], [[Canal Futura]] and [[SporTV]] to Brazilian and other Portuguese-speaking people ([[Lusophone]]s). Two distinct international feeds originate live and directly to viewers around the world from the network's broadcast center located in Rio de Janeiro, TV Globo Internacional Europe/Africa/Middle East feed &amp; the TV Globo Americas/Oceania feed.&lt;ref&gt;http://broadcastengineering.com/infrastructure/tv-globo-places-media-0902&lt;/ref&gt; A third TV Globo Internacional Asia feed originates from Japan by IPC&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcdigital.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on material recorded earlier in the day from the Americas/Oceania feed which is replayed on a tape delay schedule more suitable to the Far East Asia time zones. Other locally originated programs from Japan and other older recorded material no longer broadcast on the Americas/Oceania feed is also scheduled on the TV Globo Japan/Asia feed. Since 2007 TV Globo also operates a premium channel which originates from [[Lisbon, Portugal]], called ''TV Globo Portugal'', TV Globo Portugal differs from the TV Globo feed in Europe due to contractual agreements with other broadcast networks in Portugal, mainly [[SIC Portugal]], which holds first run rights to some TV Globo programming like novelas.

TV Globo International in the US is carried by both satellite services ([[Dish Network]], [[DirecTV]]) (which also offer [[Globosat]]'s Brazilian soccer channel Premiere Futebol Clube) and by cable Time Warner Cable in Manhattan, New York, ([[Comcast]] in [[Miami]], [[Boston]], [[New Jersey]], [[Bright House Networks]] in [[Orlando]], [[Tampa]], [[RCN Corporation|RCN]] in Boston and [[Atlantic Broadband]] in Atlanta). In [[Canada]] it is available through [[Rogers Cable]] and the [[NEXTV]] [[IPTV]] service, in [[Mexico]] and other [[Latin America]]n countries, it can be seen on [[SKY MÃ©xico|SKY]] satellite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvglobointernacional.globo.com/Mapas.aspx?id_area=3&amp;id_assine=13 Assine Globo Internacional]. TV Globo Internacional.&lt;/ref&gt;

TV Globo International is broadcasted in Australia and New Zealand via [[UBI World TV]].

==Centers==
[[Image:Tvglobo sp.jpg|left|thumb|Headquarters of Rede Globo in [[SÃ£o Paulo (city)|SÃ£o Paulo]].]]
The Television network is the centerpiece of enterprise. Globo has its main production complex in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Opened in 1995, the &quot;[[Projac]]&quot; (officially named &quot;Central Globo de ProduÃ§Ã£o&quot;, or Globo Central Production Center), where most of their shows are produced, is one of largest TV production centers in the world and the biggest in Latin America, with numerous lots and urban areas as backdrops for soap operas.

In the late 90s, Globo moved part of its news divisionâencompassing both news desks, production staff and studiosâto the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Itaim Bibi district. This is where its satellite headquarters are located, inside the home city of [[Rede Record]], its rival network since Globo's founding in 1965. Nevertheless, its main news shows, such as [[Jornal Nacional]] and FantÃ¡stico, as well as its own news channel Globo News, remain broadcasted from the main headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. This is where Globo's news headquarters, the Globo Journalism Center (now the Globo News and Sports Broadcasting Center) is located.

Rede Globo is part of the OrganizaÃ§Ãµes Globo group, a major Brazilian media conglomerate. Its associated companies are: Globo Filmes (motion picture company), Globo International Network (international broadcasting), Globo Marcas (branding and advertising), Globo Video (internet video), Globo Minas (television station at [[Belo Horizonte]]), Globo BrasÃ­lia (television station at [[BrasÃ­lia]]), Globo Nordeste (television station at [[Recife]]), Globo Rio de Janeiro (television station at [[Rio de Janeiro]]) and Globo SÃ£o Paulo (television station at [[SÃ£o Paulo]]).

==Controversy==
{{See also|Beyond Citizen Kane}}
As a consequence of the size of its viewership, Rede Globo is in a position to exert significant influence over the outcome of a local or national election. In the 1989 presidential elections, Globo aired the final debate between [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] and [[Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva]], but edited the debate in such a way that Collor received considerably more air time than Lula, and juxtaposed some of Collor's more eloquent responses with some of Lula's less eloquent responses.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bernardo Kucinski, ''A SÃ­ndrome da Antena ParabÃ³lica'', SÃ£o Paulo, Editora da FundaÃ§Ã£o Perseu Abramo, ISBN 85-86469-12-2, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, the network publicly apologized for the incident, and electoral law was changed to prohibit networks from showing edited versions of political debates and enacted a law similar to the [[United States|American]] [[equal-time rule]]. The theme was openly discussed in Jornal Nacional's official book, which was released in 2006.

In 1993 the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Channel Four|Channel 4]] made a documentary, ''[[Beyond Citizen Kane]]'', about the power and influence of the network in Brazil. The documentary had participations of great Brazilian political characters, including [[Leonel Brizola]], who was also a political adversary of Rede Globo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Globo has had a tempestuous history with the organization which owns Brazil's 2nd largest TV network: the [[Rede Record]]. Record's owners, the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], were mired in controversy during the church's growth, including an incident in 1995, when Globo aired a tape which showed the church's founder, [[Edir Macedo]], teaching other church officials how to manipulate church followers into giving more money to the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My6_faauym8 Jornal Nacional newscast of Edir Macedo]. [[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; The network was also the first to show the footage of what became known as the [[kicking of the saint]] incident.

On September 27, 2007, Rede Globo's rival, Rede Record, launched Brazil's first free-to-view 24-hour news channel on terrestrial television, [[Record News]]. Two days before the launch, the Vice-President of OrganizaÃ§Ãµes Globo, Evandro GuimarÃ£es, went to [[Brasilia]] to meet government officials, including the Communications Minister, HÃ©lio Costa, accusing Record Network of owning two television networks, Rede Record and Record News, inside the city of [[SÃ£o Paulo]], in violation of Brazilian law. Record attacked Globo in an editorial in its national news broadcast, ''Jornal da Record'', accusing Globo of trying to save its monopoly on media and news, and claimed that Globo was &quot;afraid&quot; of Record News.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0wZvPaAdRU Rede Record's Editorial about Globo's attack of Record News from &quot;Jornal da Record&quot; (in Portuguese)].[[YouTube]].&lt;/ref&gt; In its response, Record cited Globo's past controversies and the network's supportive relationship with Brazil's [[History of Brazil (1964â1985)|Military Dictatorship]] (1964-1985.){{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Of Interest to Social Scientists==
The measurable population penetration of Rede Globoâs soap operas, or [[telenovelas]], has aroused attention in the social sciences as a platform from which to examine the impact of soap operas on female empowerment and emancipation [1] (Chong and La Ferrara, 2008).  In a demand driven assessment over the course of three decades, researchers found indications that the most popular soap operas are those featuring independent women in positions of power[2].  These soap operas often featured divorced characters- a culturally taboo subject, and illegal[3]until the 1970s- and characters involved in affairs.  Researchers have examined the data and discovered links between the availability of these soap operas in rural areas and an increase in divorce, decrease in fertility[4], reduced gender preference for offspring, and an increasing awareness that domestic violence is not universally accepted as a life condition[5].  âDivorce is a salient topic from the point of view of developmentâ (ibid). In fact it has been observed that the possibility of divorce gives women leverage to achieve greater gender equality within marriage, for example, in the distribution of work (ibid).[6] Unilateral divorce laws have also been shown to decrease domestic violence, spousal homicide, and suicide (Stevenson and Wolfers,  2006)[7].  At the same time, divorce may have long-term adverse effects on children (Gruber 2004)[8].  An additional and promising finding was that, âceteris paribus, Globo coverage has the same effect as an increase of almost 1/2 year in womenâs education, in a context where the mean of womenâs years of education over the period is 3.2 years.â[9]  Other studies[10] on the effects of social messaging in media have shown similar results.  Debate on potential policy implications continues, but there remains a theoretically exploitable link between social messaging in television media and the practical advancement of social awareness.  See [[indian soap opera]] under âFurther Informationâ for indications of this approach at work in India.
