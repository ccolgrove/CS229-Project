'''Seif Adnan Kanaan''' (died October 22, 2004), was an Iraqi citizen&lt;!--I hope this is correct--&gt; who was abducted in Iraq and beheaded on October 22, 2004.  The reason given by the kidnappers, the [[Army of Ansar Al-Sunna]], was that he was employed by the [[United States Army]].

==Murder==
On October 22, 2004, a video was posted on the website of the [[Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna|Army of Ansar Al-Sunna]], apparently showed the beheading of Kanaan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A56487-2004Oct23.html] Washington Times. October 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kanaan was shown in a picture surrounded by the three hooded gunmen with a banner of the Army of Ansar Al-Sunna in the background. They accused him of being an American spy recruited in Mosul. In the video the man makes a statement:

&quot;My name is Seif Adnan Kanaan. I work at [[Mosul]] airport... My second job is to supply beverages to the US army,&quot; the victim said, surrounded by three hooded gunmen.

One of the gunmen then reads a statement saying that &quot;the mujahedeen (Islamic fighters) in Mosul were able to capture ... a [[Tenth Crusade|crusader]] [[Espionage|spy]] recruited by US forces to spy and inform on the [[Mujahideen|mujahedeen]] in Mosul.&quot;

The gunman said the purported spy worked at a US base in Mosul airport and &quot;was known for his allegiance to the Americans and his hatred for the mujahedeen.&quot; He had &quot;publicly insulted ([[Islam]]'s) Prophet [[Muhammad|Mohammed]].&quot;

&quot;We tell people like him: the door of repentance is open... Announce your repentance and live in peace among your kin,&quot; the gunman said.  He then warned that &quot;The mujahedeen will catch those who persist in working with US forces, and settle for nothing less than [[Decapitation|beheading]] them.&quot;

The man was beheaded after &quot;confessing to all the actions he carried out.&quot; 
The group also posted the statement on its website, accompanied by pictures of the beheading.

The video showed the man who read the statement later beheading the victim with a [[knife]]. He placed the head on the back of the victim, who lay in a pool of blood.

The man had been killed &quot;to serve as a lesson for others,&quot; the murderer said.
