== History==
An institution of higher learning in the province of Quezon, Southern Luzon State University (SLSU) had its beginnings starting as Lucban Municipal Junior High School by virtue of Municipal Resolution No. 5 passed in April 1964. The permit to operate was bestowed by Assistant Secretary of Education Hon. Miguel Gaffud in July 1964. On May 1965, the Municipal Resolution No. 86 was passed requesting the change of name to Lucban Municipal High School. The Director of Public Schools Dr. Vitaliano Bernardino approved this resolution in August 1965. Lucban Community College was created and was made part of Lucban Municipal Junior School as an adjunct institution for College Education in June 1968.

Lucban School for Philippine Craftsmen formally started in July 1970 by virtue of Republic Act 4345 also known as the merger law took into effect merging the Lucban Municipal high School and Lucban School of Philippine Craftsmen, thus forming the Lucban National High School in July 1972 (with the continuous operation of Lucban Community College). The future of the College was visualized in 1981 when 20 Assemblymen of Southern Tagalog Region sponsored the Parliamentary Bill No. 173 for the conversion of Lucban National College into Southern Luzon Polytechnic College. The bill was approved in December 1981 and was signed into law known as Batas Pambansa No. 145 by President Ferdinand E. Marcos.

The growth of SLPC was manifested in the existence of seven satellite campuses located in various parts of the province of Quezon. The first satellite campus was SLPC-Alabat, established in July 1991. In 1991, SLPC-Polilio was created by virtue of Board Resolution No. 19, Series of 1992. The following year, two additiional campuses were established: SLPC-Sampaloc in Brgy. Caldong, Sampaloc, Quezon (BOT Res. No. 33, series of 1993) and SLPC-Infanta. In 1996, another campus, the SLPC-Lucena Dual Training and Livelihood Center, was established under Board Resolution No. 130, series of 1996. Judge Guillermo Eleazar Polytechnic College was integrated in February 2002 under Board Resolution No. 352, series of 2002. The newest campus was established in Tiaong, Quezon in 2005.

Mr. Angelo PeÃ±a was the founding president of SLPC. He served from 1964-1986. Dr. Palermo Salvacion served as the Officer-in-Charge of the College in 1986. In 1987, Dr. Ernesto de Chavez led the school and ended his term in June, 1990. Dr. Joselito B. Jara took his office as College President in 1990. On May 31, 2002, Dr. Cornelio D. Esquieres became the college president until his demise in August 2004.

Dr. Cecilia N. Gascon was designated as Officer-in-Charge of the College in January 2004 and as Acting President to serve the unfinished term of Dr. Esquieres until May 31, 2006. Dr. Gascon became the full-fledged College President on June 1, 2006. On March 17, 2007, SLPC was converted to Southern Luzon State University by virtue of R.A. 9395 signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Dr. Gascon became the first University President by virtue of Board Resolution No. 609 Series of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slsu.edu.ph/about.html About]&lt;/ref&gt;
