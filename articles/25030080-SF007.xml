'''Bada''' (stylized as '''bada'''; [[Korean language|Korean]]: {{lang|ko|ë°ë¤}}) is an [[mobile operating system|operating system for mobile devices]] such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s. It is developed  by the [[Samsung Electronics]]. Its name is derived from &quot;{{lang|ko|ë°ë¤}} (bada)&quot;, meaning &quot;ocean&quot; or &quot;sea&quot; in [[Korean language|Korean]]. It ranges from low-end [[feature phone]]s to high-end smartphones.&lt;ref name=&quot;badaInfo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximejohnson.com/techno/2010/07/bada-un-systeme-d%E2%80%99exploitation-pour-les-cellulaires-samsung/ |title=bada: un systÃ¨me dâexploitation pour les cellulaires Samsung |date= |publisher=Maximejohnson.com/techno |accessdate=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To foster adoption of Bada OS, Samsung is reportedly considering releasing the source code under an [[open-source]] license, and expanding device support to include [[Smart TV]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/20/samsung-to-make-bada-os-open-source-and-part-of-your-smart-tv/ |title=Samsung To Make Bada OS Open Source And Part Of Your Smart TV? |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

After the announcement, the [[Samsung S8500|Wave S8500]] was first shown at Mobile World Congress 2010 in [[Barcelona]] in February 2010. At that time, applications running on the first Bada phone were demonstrated, including [[Gameloft]]'s ''[[Asphalt 5]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asphalt5&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Demonstration of Asphalt 5 on a bada phone |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myliFc36KW4/ |newspaper=Youtube Video|date=26 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the launch, companies such as [[Twitter]], [[EA]], [[Capcom]], [[Gameloft]] and [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]] showed their support for the Bada platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unveils&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung unveils new smartphone platform bada |author= |url=http://www.bada.com/samsung-unveils-new-smartphone-platform/ |newspaper=bada.com |date=8 Dec 2009 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Samsung released a beta of their Bada [[software development kit]] (SDK) to attract developers. Samsung also began the Bada Developer Challenge with a total prize of $2,700,000 (USD).&lt;ref name=&quot;Samsung1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.bada.com/apis/docs/commonpage.do?menu=MC01140100 |title=BadaDeveloper Site |date= |publisher=bada Developers Site |accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2010, Samsung released version 1.0 of the SDK.

In August 2011, Samsung released version 2.0 of the SDK. This new version provides many enhancements over its predecessors.

The first Bada-based phone was the [[Samsung S8500|Samsung Wave S8500]], released on June 1, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Samsung Wave, first Bada smartphone hits the market |author= |url=http://www.bada.com/samsung-wave-first-bada-smartphone-hits-the-market/ |work=bada |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://badawave.com/ bada Wave website&lt;/ref&gt; which sold one million handsets in its first 4 weeks on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1722287/samsung-waves-away-million |title=Samsung Waves away a million |date=13 July 2010 |publisher=[[The Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
The Samsung S8500 Wave was launched with version 1.0 of the Bada operating system. Soon after the launch, Samsung released version 1.0.2, which included minor fixes for European users.&lt;ref name=&quot;update1.0.2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Samsung Wave gets an update to Bada version 1.0.2 |url=http://www.techknots.com/mobiles/samsung-wave-gets-an-update-to-bada-version-1-0-2/ |newspaper=TechKnots|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version 1.2 was released with the Samsung S8530 Wave II phone.&lt;ref name=&quot;S8530announce&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Samsung announces S8530 Wave II, meet the big-screen edition |newspaper=GSMArena.com|date=4 October 2010|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_announces_s8530_wave_ii_meet_the_bigscreen_edition-news-1974.php/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alpha-version of Bada 2.0 was introduced on February 15, 2011, with Samsung S8600 Wave III.

==Samsung Apps==
With the release of the Samsung Wave, Samsung opened an international application store, [[Samsung Apps]], for the Bada platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;SamsungApps&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Samsung Wave European Launch to Propel Samsung Apps |url=http://www.samsungapps.com/notice/getNoticeDetail.as?csNoticeID=0000000333/ |newspaper=Samsung Apps |date=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, Samsung Apps had 300 applications to offer, 70% of them being free. Samsung expected to have 7000 applications in its application store by the end of 2010. It did not achieve this aim and had around 3000 applications at the end of the [[calendar year#Quarters|first quarter]] of 2011.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Architecture==
Bada, as Samsung defines it, is not an operating system itself, but a platform with a [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] configurable architecture, which allows using either a proprietary [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS) kernel, or the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref name=Samsung1/&gt; According to copyrights displayed by [[Samsung Wave S8500]], it uses code from [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]], although other phones might use [[Linux]] instead.

On the kernel are layers for devices, services, and frameworks. The ''device layer'' provides core functions such as graphics, protocols, telephony and security. The ''service layer'' provides more service-centric features such as [[SMS]], mapping and in-app-purchasing. To provide such features there is a so-called ''bada Server''. The top layer, the ''framework layer'' provides an [[application programming interface]] (API) in C++ for application developers to use.

Bada provides various UI controls to developers: It provides assorted basic UI controls such as Listbox, Color Picker and Tab, has a [[web browser]] control based on the open-source [[WebKit]], and features [[Adobe Flash]], supporting Flash 9, or 10 in Bada 2.0. Both the WebKit and Flash can be embedded inside native Bada applications. Bada supports OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API and offers interactive mapping with [[point of interest]] (POI) features, which can also be embedded inside native applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;LFD1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Samsung-bada-SDK/ |title=Samsung's mobile OS SDK ships, runs on Linux |author=Eric Brown |date=8 December 2009 |publisher=[[eWeek]] |accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It supports pinch-to-zoom, [[tab (GUI)|tabbed browsing]] and [[cut, copy, and paste]] features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/1726832/samsung-wave-smartphone |title=Samsung Wave smartphone |date=9 August 2010 |publisher=''The Inquirer''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bada supports many mechanisms to enhance interaction, which can be incorporated into applications. These include various sensors such as motion sensing, vibration control, [[face detection]], [[accelerometer]], [[magnetometer]], tilt, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), and [[multi-touch]].&lt;ref name=Samsung1/&gt;

Native applications are developed in [[C++]] with the Bada [[software development kit|SDK]], and the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] based [[integrated development environment]] (IDE). GNU-based tool chains are used for building and debugging applications. The IDE also contains UI Builder, with which developers can easily design the interface of their applications by dragging and dropping UI controls into forms. For testing and debugging, the IDE contains an emulator which can run apps.

==Devices==

Samsung's first phone running the Bada platform was the [[Samsung S8500|Wave S8500]]. The Wave is a slim touchscreen phone powered by Samsung's &quot;Hummingbird&quot; CPU (S5PC110), which includes a 1&amp;nbsp;GHz ARM Cortex-A8 CPU and a built-in [[PowerVR]] SGX 3D graphics engine, &quot;Super AMOLED&quot; screen and 720p high-def video capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2359170,00.asp/ bada's Big: Samsung Announces First bada Phone]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samsung S8530 Wave II was made available in November 2010. It has a 3.7&quot; Super Clear capacitive LCD touchscreen. It is preloaded with Bada 1.2.&lt;ref name=S8530announce/&gt;

At the end of August 2011, Samsung announced three new models which will all ship with Bada 2.0. The Samsung Wave 3 will be a high-end model featuring 1.4GHz CPU with integrated PowerVR SGX 540 GPU, 4&quot; AMOLED screen and 5MP camera. The Wave M and Wave Y will be lower-priced models, using slower CPUs, smaller LCD screens, and lacking other features found in the Wave 3.

==Criticism==

*All VOIP over wifi applications were banned which means that popular applications such as Skype cannot be used. In March 2011 this restriction was removed, allowing VOIP applications to run on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joernesdohr.com/bada/bada-voip-applications-finally-allowed/&lt;/ref&gt;

Some publications have criticised Bada over the following issues:

*The external sensor [[application programming interface|API]] is not open-ended, preventing new types of sensors or unexpected technology developments from being added in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reg1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/09/samsung_bada/ |title=What's so bad about Samsung's bada? |date=9 March 2010 |publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Due to &quot;performance and privacy issues&quot;, Bada 1.x applications cannot access the SMS/MMS inbox or receive incoming SMS/MMS notifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpimg.ospos.net/contents/tutorials/bada_1.0.0b2/badaTutorial.Communication.pdf |title=bada Tutorial: Communication |date=2010 |accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bada versions 1.x only allowed one Bada third party application to run at a time. Multitasking applications was only possible between the base applications and one Bada application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Single bada Application Policy|url=http://developer.bada.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.osp.appuiguide.help/html/design_guidelines_basic_app/single_bada_app_policy/single_bada_app_policy.htm|publisher=bada Developers Site|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limit is removed since version 2.0.

However these issues will be resolved in the upcoming Bada 2.0. Samsung Bada 2.0 OS new features will include also following updates: [[HTML5]], full multitasking, adobe flash 11, smart-wallpapers, text-to-speech, push notification, near-field communication, new security policies and protection functions, and [[OpenAL]]. The next Bada version was shown at IFA 2011 in Berlin.

==Market shares==
According to [[Canalys]], Samsung shipped 3.5 million phones running Bada in Q1 of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://gigaom.com/mobile/windows-phone-7-shipments-q1/&lt;/ref&gt; This rose to 4.5 million phones in Q2 of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/PG.Biz/asymco+news/news.asp?c=32049&lt;/ref&gt;
