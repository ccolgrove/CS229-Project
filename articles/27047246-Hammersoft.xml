'''&quot;Your Pussy's Glued to a Building on Fire&quot;''' is a [[1994]] song by [[John Frusciante]].

Frusciante had joined the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] in 1988. He wrote and recorded the song during the writing of the band's 1991 album ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' and left the band in [[1992]]. In [[1994]] he released his solo album ''[[Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt]]''.
