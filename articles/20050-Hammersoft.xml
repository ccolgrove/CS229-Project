The '''Minnesota Twins''' are a [[professional baseball|professional baseball team]] based in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota. They play in the [[American League Central|Central Division]] of [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[American League]]. The team is named after the [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] area of Minneapolis and [[Saint Paul, MN|St. Paul]]. They played in [[Metropolitan Stadium]] from 1961 to 1981 and the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] from 1982 to 2009. They played their inaugural game at the newly completed [[Target Field]] on April 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20100104&amp;content_id=7870938&amp;vkey=pr_min&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=min |title=Minnesota Twins Move Into Target Field |publisher=minnesota.twins.mlb.com |date=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team was founded in Kansas City in 1894 as a [[Western League (original)|Western League]] team and would move to Washington, D.C., in 1901 as one of the eight original teams of the American League, named the '''Washington Senators''' or '''Washington Nationals'''.  Although the Washington team endured long bouts of mediocrity (immortalized in the Broadway musical ''[[Damn Yankees]]''), they had a period of prolonged success in the 1920s and 1930s, led by Hall-of-Famers [[Bucky Harris]], [[Goose Goslin]], [[Sam Rice]], [[Joe Cronin]], and above all [[Walter Johnson]].  Manager [[Clark Griffith]] joined the team in 1912 and became the team's owner in 1920.  The franchise remained under Griffith family ownership until 1984.

In 1960, Major League Baseball granted the city of Minneapolis an expansion team. Washington owner [[Calvin Griffith]], Clark's nephew and adopted son, requested that he be allowed to move his team to Minneapolis and instead give Washington the expansion team. Upon league approval, the team moved to [[Minnesota]] after the 1960 season, setting up shop in [[Metropolitan Stadium]], while Washington fielded a brand new &quot;Washington Senators&quot; (which later became the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] prior to the 1972 season).

Success came quickly to the team in Minnesota. Sluggers [[Harmon Killebrew]] and [[Bob Allison]], who had already been stars in Washington, were joined by [[Tony Oliva]] and [[Zoilo Versalles]], and later [[second baseman]] [[Rod Carew]] and pitchers [[Jim Kaat]] and [[Jim Perry (baseball)|Jim Perry]], winning the [[List of American League pennant winners|American League pennant]] in 1965. A second wave of success came in the late 1980s and early 1990s, led by [[Kent Hrbek]], [[Bert Blyleven]], [[Frank Viola]], and [[Kirby Puckett]], winning the franchise's second and third World Series (and first in Minnesota).

Through the 2010 season, the franchise has won three World Series championships (1924, 1987, and 1991), and has fielded 18 [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|American League batting champions]].

==Team history==
{{Main|History of the Minnesota Twins}}

===Washington Nationals/Senators: 1901â1960===
[[File:1924worldseries.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Washington's [[Bucky Harris]] scores on his home run in the fourth inning of Game 7 of the 1924 World Series]]For a time, from 1911 to 1933, the Washington Senators were one of the more successful franchises in major-league baseball. The team's rosters included Hall of Famers [[Goose Goslin]], [[Sam Rice]], [[Joe Cronin]], [[Bucky Harris]], [[Heinie Manush]] and one of the greatest pitchers of all time, [[Walter Johnson]].

In the [[1924 World Series]], the Senators defeated the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] in seven games. The [[1925 Major League Baseball season|following season]], they repeated as [[American League]] champions but ultimately lost the [[1925 World Series]] to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]. After Walter Johnsonâs retirement in 1927, he was hired as manager of the Senators. After enduring a few losing seasons, the team returned to contention in 1930. In 1933, Senators owner [[Clark Griffith]] returned to the formula that worked for him nine years before, and 26-year-old shortstop Joe Cronin became [[player-manager]]. The Senators posted a 99â53 record and cruised to the pennant seven games ahead of the [[New York Yankees]], but in the [[1933 World Series]] the Giants exacted their revenge, winning in five games. Following the loss, the Senators sank all the way to seventh place in 1934, and attendance began to fall. Despite the return of Harris as manager from 1935â42 and again from 1950â54, Washington was mostly a losing ball club for the next 25 years, contending for the pennant only during World War II. Washington came to be known as &quot;first in war, first in peace, and last in the American League&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Washington Senators |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Washington_Senators |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |accessdate=Aug. 7, 2009 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their hard luck being crucial to the plot of the musical and film ''[[Damn Yankees (musical)|Damn Yankees]]''. In 1954, the Senators signed future Hall of Famer [[Harmon Killebrew]]. By 1959, he was the Senatorsâ regular third baseman, leading the league with 42 home runs and earning a starting spot on the [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|American League All-Star team]].

[[File:Walter Johnson and Calvin Coolidge shake hands FINAL.jpg|thumb|left|300px|President [[Calvin Coolidge]] (left) and Washington Senators pitcher [[Walter Johnson]] (right) shake hands following the Senators' 1924 championship]]
After Griffith's death in 1955, his nephew and adopted son [[Calvin Griffith|Calvin]] took over the team presidency. He sold [[Griffith Stadium]] to the city of Washington and leased it back, leading to speculation that the team was planning to move, as the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]], [[St. Louis Browns]] and [[Philadelphia Athletics]] had all done in the early 1950s. By 1957, after an early flirtation with San Francisco (where the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] would eventually move after that season ended), Griffith began courting Minneapolis-St. Paul, a prolonged process that resulted in his rejecting the Twin Cities' first offer&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite document |title=Senators Reject Bids to Move to Minneapolis or St. Paul |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20E1EF93A5A177B93C0AB178BD95F438585F9&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=giants+relocate+minneapolis&amp;st=p |work=New York Times  |date=October 27, 1957 |accessdate=May 2, 2008 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; before agreeing to relocate. The American League opposed the move at first, but in 1960 a deal was reached: The Senators would move and would be replaced with an expansion [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Senators]] team for 1961. Thus, the old Washington Senators became the Minnesota Twins.

====Team nickname====
The Washington franchise was known as both &quot;Senators&quot; and &quot;Nationals&quot; at various times, and sometimes at the same time.  In 1905, the team changed its official name to the &quot;Washington Nationals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIN/ |title=Minnesota Twins Team History &amp; Encyclopedia | work=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=Sept. 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;Nationals&quot; appeared on uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the &quot;W&quot; logo for the next 52 years. The media often shortened the nickname to &quot;Nats.&quot; Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the &quot;Senators&quot; nickname. Over time, &quot;Nationals&quot; faded as a nickname, and &quot;Senators&quot; became dominant. Baseball guides listed the club's nickname as &quot;Nationals or Senators,&quot; acknowledging the dual-nickname situation.

The team name was officially changed to Washington Senators around the time of [[Clark Griffith]]'s death. It was not until 1959 that the word &quot;Senators&quot; first appeared on team shirts. &quot;Nats&quot; continued to be used by space-saving headline writers, even for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|1961 expansion team]], which was never officially known as &quot;Nationals.&quot;

===Minnesota Twins: 1961 to present===

The name &quot;Twins&quot; was derived from the popular name of the region, the Twin Cities. The [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Minneapolis Lakers]] had re-located to Los Angeles in 1960 due to poor attendance which was believed to have been caused in part by the reluctance of fans in St. Paul to support the team.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the team after one city or the other, so his desire was to name the team the &quot;Twin Cities Twins&quot;,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} however MLB objected. Griffith therefore named the team the ''Minnesota Twins''.  However, the team was allowed to keep its original &quot;TC&quot; (for Twin Cities) insignia for its caps.  The team's logo shows two men, one in a [[Minneapolis Millers]] uniform and one in a [[St. Paul Saints#St. Paul Saints (1915-1960)|St. Paul Saints]] uniform, shaking hands across the [[Mississippi River]].  The &quot;TC&quot; remained on the Twins' caps until 1987, when they adopted their current uniforms.  By this time, the team felt it was established enough to put an &quot;M&quot; on its cap without having St. Paul fans think it stood for Minneapolis. The &quot;TC&quot; logo was moved to a sleeve on the jerseys, and occasionally appeared as an alternate cap design.  Both the &quot;TC&quot; and &quot;Minnie &amp; Paul&quot; logos remain the team's primary insignia. As of 2010, the &quot;TC&quot; logo has been reinstated on the cap as their cap logo.

====1960s====
The Twins were eagerly greeted in Minnesota when they arrived in 1961. They brought a nucleus of talented players: Killebrew, [[Bob Allison]], [[Camilo Pascual]], Zoilo Versalles, [[Jim Kaat]], [[Earl Battey]], and [[Lenny Green]]. The Twins won 91 games in 1962, the most by the franchise since 1933. The Twins won 102 games and the American League Pennant in 1965, but they were defeated in the [[1965 World Series]] by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in seven games (behind the [[World Series Most Valuable Player]], [[Sandy Koufax]], with a 2â1 record, including winning the seventh game).

Heading into the final weekend of the season in 1967, the Twins, [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Chicago White Sox]], and [[Detroit Tigers]] all had a shot at clinching the American League championship. The Twins and the Red Sox started the weekend tied for 1st place and played against each other in Boston for the final three games of the season. The Red Sox won two out of the three games, seizing their first pennant since 1946 with a 92â70 record. The Twins and Tigers both finished one game back, with 91â71 records, while the White Sox finished three games back, at 89â73. In 1969, the new manager of the Twins, [[Billy Martin]], pushed aggressive base running all-around, and [[Rod Carew]] set the all-time Major League record by stealing home seven times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/hofers_and_honorees/hofer_bios/Carew_Rod.htm Rod Carew] Baseball Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt; These [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|1969 Twins]] won the very first [[American League Western Division]] Championship, but they lost to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in the first [[1969 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]. This same situation was also repeated during their [[1970 Minnesota Twins season|1970 season]], with the Twins winning the Western Division behind the star pitching of Jim Perry (24 -12) and the Orioles winning the Eastern Division Championship behind the star pitching of [[Jim Palmer]]. Once again, the Orioles won the A.L. Championship Series.

====1970s====
After winning the division again in 1970, the team entered an eight-year dry spell, finishing around the .500 mark. Killebrew departed after 1974. Owner [[Calvin Griffith]] faced financial difficulty with the start of [[free agency]], costing the Twins the services of [[Lyman Bostock]] and [[Larry Hisle]], who left as free agents after the 1977 season, and Carew, who was traded after the 1978 season.

====1980sâ90s====
[[Image:051207-MPLS-006Metrodome-crop.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]], 2007]]
In the early 1980s, the Twins moved into the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], which they shared with the [[Minnesota Vikings]], but the team continued to struggle. In 1984, Griffith sold the Twins to multi-billionaire banker/financier [[Carl Pohlad]]. The Metrodome hosted the [[1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. After several losing seasons, the [[1987 Minnesota Twins season|team]], led by [[Kent Hrbek]], [[Frank Viola]], [[Bert Blyleven]], [[Jeff Reardon]], and rising star [[Kirby Puckett]], returned to the World Series, defeating the Tigers in the [[1987 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. [[Tom Kelly (baseball)|Tom Kelly]] managed the Twins to World Series victories over the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in [[1987 World Series|1987]] and the [[Atlanta Braves]] in [[1991 World Series|1991]]. Twins' pitcher [[Jack Morris]] was the star of the series in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caple|first=Jim|title=1991 World Series had it all|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/1991_series_caple.html|newspaper=ESPN|date=November 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1991 marked the first time that any team that finished in last place the previous year advanced to the World Series. (The Atlanta Braves also did this in 1991, in the [[National League]].)

The World Series in 1991 is regarded by many as one of the classics of all time. In this Series, four games were won during the teams' final at-bat, and three of these were in extra innings. The Atlanta Braves won all three of their games in Atlanta, and the Twins won all four of their games in Minnesota. The seventh game was tied 0â0 after the regulation nine innings, and marked only the second time that the seventh game of the World Series had ever gone into extra innings.The Twins won by scoring a run in the bottom of the 10th inning, and Morris had pitched a shutout for all ten innings against the Braves.

After a winning season in 1992, the Twins fell into a years-long stretch of mediocrity, posting a losing record each year for the next eight years: 71â91 in 1993, 50â63 in 1994, 56â88 in 1995, 78â84 in 1996, 68â94 in 1997, 70â92 in 1998, 63â97 in 1999 and 69â93 in 2000. From 1994 to 1997, a long sequence of retirements and injuries hurt the team badly, and Tom Kelly spent the remainder of his managerial career attempting to rebuild the Twins. In 1997, owner [[Carl Pohlad]] almost sold the Twins to [[North Carolina]] businessman Don Beaver, who would have moved the team to the [[Piedmont Triad]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/34814 Twins Meet Don Beaver: He Inks Letter of Intent to Buy Team] Street &amp; Smith's SportsBusiness Daily&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000s====
[[Image:00112696 Justin Morneau.jpg|thumb|right|[[Justin Morneau]], drafted in 1999 by the Twins, won the [[AL MVP]] award in 2006]]
The Twins dominated the Central Division in the first decade of the new century, winning the division in six of those ten years ('02, '03, '04, '06, '09 and '10), and nearly winning it in '08 as well.  From 2001 to 2006, the Twins compiled the longest streak of consecutive winning seasons since moving to Minnesota.

Threatened with closure by [[#Contraction|league contraction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/contraction1.html |title=Labor Pains: A guide to Major League Baseball's contraction issue | last=Gettings |first=John |publisher=Infoplease.com |date=2001 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[2002 Minnesota Twins season|2002 team]] battled back to reach the [[2002 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] before being eliminated 4â1 by that year's World Series champion Anaheim Angels.

=====2006=====
{{Main|2006 Minnesota Twins season}}

In 2006, the Twins won the division on the last day of the regular season (the only day all season they held sole possession of first place) but lost to the Oakland Athletics in the [[2006 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. [[Ozzie GuillÃ©n]] coined a nickname for this squad, calling the Twins &quot;[[Piranhas (baseball)|little piranhas]]&quot;. The Twins players embraced the label, and in response, the Twins Front office started a &quot;Piranha Night&quot;, with piranha finger puppets given out to the first 10,000 fans.  Scoreboard operators sometimes played an animated sequence of piranhas munching under that caption in situations where the Twins were scoring runs playing &quot;[[small ball]]&quot;, and the stadium vendors sold tee-shirts and hats advertising &quot;The Little Piranhas&quot;.
The Twins also had the AL MVP in Justin Morneau, the AL batting champion in [[Joe Mauer]], and the AL Cy Young Award winner in [[Johan Santana]].

=====2008=====
{{Main|2008 Minnesota Twins season}}

In 2008, the Twins finished the regular season tied with the White Sox on top of the AL Central, forcing a [[2008 American League Central tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] in Chicago to determine the division champion. The Twins lost that game and missed the playoffs. The game location was determined by rule of a coin flip that was conducted in mid-September . This rule was changed for the start of the 2009 season, making the site for any [[One-game playoff|tiebreaker game]] to be determined by the winner of the regular season head-to-head record between the teams involved.

=====2009=====
{{Main|2009 Minnesota Twins season}}

After a mediocre year where the Twins played .500 baseball for most of the season, they won 17 of their last 21 games to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the Central Division.  The Twins were able to use the play-in game rule to their advantage when they won the [[American League Central|AL Central]] at the end of the regular season and winning a 12-inning tiebreaker on a walk-off hit by [[Alexi Casilla]].  However, they failed to advance to the [[2009 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] as they lost the [[2009 American League Championship Series|American League Divisional Series]] in three straight games to the eventual World Series champion New York Yankees.  That year Joe Mauer became only the second catcher in 33 years to win the AL MVP award ([[IvÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez]] won for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in 1999, previous to that, the last catcher to win an AL MVP was the [[New York Yankees]] [[Thurman Munson]] in 1976).

=====2010=====
{{Main|2010 Minnesota Twins season}}

In their inaugural season played at Target Field, the Twins finished the regular season with a record of 94 wins and 68 losses, clinching the AL Central Division title for the 6th time in 9 years under manager [[Ron Gardenhire]].  New regular players included rookie [[Danny Valencia]] at third base, designated hitter [[Jim Thome]], closer [[Matt Capps]], infielder [[J.J. Hardy]], and infielder [[Orlando Hudson]]. In relief pitching roles were late additions [[Brian Fuentes]] and [[Randy Flores]]. On July 7, the team suffered a major blow when Justin Morneau sustained a concussion, which knocked him out for the rest of the season. In the [[2010 American League Division Series|divisional series]], the Twins lost to the Yankees in a 3 game sweep for the second consecutive year. Following the season, Ron Gardenhire finally received AL [[Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] honors after finishing as a runner up in several prior years.

=====2011=====
{{Main|2011 Minnesota Twins season}}

After repeating as AL Central champions in 2010, the Twins entered 2011 with no players on the disabled list, and the team seemed poised for another strong season. During the off-season, the team signed Japanese shortstop [[Tsuyoshi Nishioka]] to fill a hole in the middle infield, re-signed Jim Thome, who was in pursuit of career home run number 600, and also re-signed [[Carl Pavano]]. However, the season was largely derailed by an extensive list of injuries. Nishioka's broken leg in a collision at second base&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/team/transactions.jsp?c_id=min#month=4&amp;year=2011&amp;team_id=142&lt;/ref&gt; led the way and was followed by DL stints from [[Kevin Slowey]], Joe Mauer, [[Jason Repko]], Thome, [[Delmon Young]] (two stints on the DL), [[Jose Mijares]], [[Glen Perkins]], [[Joe Nathan]], [[Francisco Liriano]], [[Jason Kubel]], [[Denard Span]] (two stints), Justin Morneau, [[Scott Baker (right-handed pitcher)|Scott Baker]], and Alexi Casilla. The team's low point was arguably on May 1 when the team started 7 players who were batting below .235 in a game against Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;http://sportsillustrated.ca/baseball/mlb/gameflash/2011/05/01/36730_boxscore.html&lt;/ref&gt; From that day forward, the Twins made a strong push to get as close as 5 games back of the division lead by the All-Star break.  However, the team struggled down the stretch and fell back out of contention. The team failed to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2008 and experienced their first losing season in four years. Despite an AL-worst 63-99 record, the team drew over 3 million fans for the second consecutive year. 

[[Michael Cuddyer]] served as the Twins representative at the All-Star game, his first appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/07/03/michael-cuddyer-a-first-time-all-star-at-age-32/&lt;/ref&gt; Bert Blyleven's number was retired during the season and he was also inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during the month of July.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/new-york/story/_/id/6798447/roerto-alomar-bert-blyleven-pat-gillick-welcomed-hof&lt;/ref&gt;. On August 10, Nathan recorded his 255th save, passing [[Rick Aguilera]] for first place on the franchise's all-time saves list.&lt;ref&gt;http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110811&amp;content_id=23062942&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;c_id=min&lt;/ref&gt; On August 15, Thome hit 599th and 600th homerun at [[Comerica Park]] to become the eighth player in Major League history to hit 600 homeruns, joining [[Babe Ruth]], [[Willie Mays]], [[Hank Aaron]], [[Barry Bonds]], [[Sammy Sosa]], [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[Alex Rodriguez]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/127799298.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

The quirks of the [[Hubert H.

Co.|location=New York|isbn=9781402736254|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eUe37F9gN00C&amp;pg=PT1679&amp;lpg=PT1679&amp;dq=only+World+Series+in+which+home+team+won+every+game&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FXvzTUWA5-&amp;sig=JqC616rbH97s8eovZnacs0XAu9E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iMy7S9eeMY_K8wTe-PCCCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=only%20World%20Series%20in%20which%20home%20team%20won%20every%20game&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The feat has since been repeated once, by the [[2001 World Series|Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001]].)  Nevertheless, the Twins argued that the Metrodome was obsolete and that the lack of a dedicated baseball-only ballpark limited team revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team. The team  was rumored to contemplate moving to such places as [[New Jersey]], Las Vegas, [[Portland, Oregon]], the [[Research Triangle|RaleighâDurham]] area, and elsewhere in search of a more financially competitive market. In 2002, the team was nearly disbanded when Major League Baseball selected the Twins and the [[Montreal Expos]] (now the [[Washington Nationals]] franchise) for elimination due to their financial weakness relative to other franchises in the league. The impetus for league contraction diminished after a court decision forced the Twins to play out their lease on the Metrodome.  However, the Twins continued their efforts to relocate, pursuing litigation against the Metropolitan Stadium Commission and obtaining a state court ruling that they were not obligated to play in the Metrodome after the 2006 season. This cleared the way for the Twins to either be relocated or disbanded prior to the 2007 season if a new deal was not reached.

===Target Field===
[[Image:Target Field - Opening Day of Inaugural Season.jpg|thumb|left|Opening day at [[Target Field]] in 2010]]
In response to the threatened loss of the Twins, the Minnesota private and public sector negotiated and approved a financing package for a replacement stadiumâ a baseball-only outdoor, natural turf ballpark in the [[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] of [[Central, Minneapolis|downtown Minneapolis]]â owned by a new entity known as the Minnesota Ballpark Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/stories/2010/04/01/17066/target_field_the_house_that_jerry_bell_willed_to_completion |last=Weiner |first=Jay |title=Target Field: 'The House That Jerry Bell Willed to Completion' |publisher=MinnPost |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Target Field]] was constructed at a cost of $544.4&amp;nbsp;million (including site acquisition and infrastructure), utilizing the proceeds of a $392&amp;nbsp;million public bond offering based on a 0.15 percent sales tax in Hennepin County and private financing of $185&amp;nbsp;million provided by the [[Carl Pohlad|Pohlad family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/editorials/46497222.html |title=Editorial: Target Field built to exceed expectations |publisher=Star Tribune |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jack |last=Gordon |url=http://www.tcbmag.com/print.aspx?print_page=%2Findustriestrends%2Fcommercialrealestate%2F127061printp1.aspx&amp;string_referer=/industriestrends/commercialrealestate/127061p1.aspx |title=The Coolest Ballpark in America |publisher=Twin Cities Business Magazine |date=March 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the deal, the Twins also signed a 30-year lease of the new stadium, effectively guaranteeing the continuation of the team in Minnesota for a long time to come. Construction of the new field began in 2007, and was completed in December 2009, in time for the 2010 season. Commissioner [[Bud Selig]], who earlier had threatened to disband the team, observed that without the new stadium the Twins could not have committed to sign their star player, catcher [[Joe Mauer]], to an unprecedented 8-year, $184&amp;nbsp;million contract extension. The first regular season game in Target Field was played against the [[Boston Red Sox]] on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5â2.

On May 18, 2011, Target Field was named &quot;The Sports Facility of the Year&quot; by [[Street and Smith]]âs SportsBusiness Journal at the magazine's 2011 Sports Business Awards Ceremony in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/blog/sports-business/2011/05/target-field-named-sports-facility-of.html |title=Target Field named Sports Facility of the Year |first=John |last=Vomhof Jr. |publisher=Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal |date=May 19, 2011 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also named &quot;The Best Sports Stadium in North America&quot; by [[ESPN The Magazine]] in a ranking that included over 120 different stadiums, ballparks and arenas from around North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hart Van Denburg |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2010/07/espn_calls_trag.php |title=ESPN Magazine calls Target Field the best stadium in North America |publisher=City Pages |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retired numbers==
[[File:Metrodome curtain of fame.JPG|thumb|left|wide|750px|Metrodome retired numbers and championships banners]]

{{Clear}}

The Metrodome's upper deck in center and right fields was partly covered by a curtain containing banners of various titles won, and retired numbers. There was no acknowledgment of the Twins' prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. Killebrew did play seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961.

[[File:Target Field 04.12.2010 059 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Target Field retired number signs]] In the Metrodome, the numbers ran in that order from left to right. In Target Field, they run from right to left, presumably to allow space for additional numbers in the future.
The retired numbers also serve as entry points at Target Field, The center field gate is Gate No. 3, honoring  Killebrew, the left field gate is Gate No. 6 honoring Oliva, the home plate gate is Gate No. 14 for Hrbek, the right field gate serves as Gate No. 29 in tribute to Carew, and the plaza gate is known as Gate No. 34, honoring Puckett.

The numbers that have been retired hang within Target Field in front of the tower that serves as the Twins' executive offices in left field foul territory. The championships banners have been replaced by small pennants that fly on masts at the back of the left field upper deck. Those pennants, along with the flags flying in the plaza behind right field, serve as a visual cue for the players, suggesting the wind direction and speed.

[[Jackie Robinson]]'s number, 42, was retired by Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997 and formally honored by the Twins on May 23, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=gXxe3Gi8Ca4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=minnesota+jackie+robinson+%22May+23+1997%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8DH_7ly1u2&amp;sig=BT_fjk1Y8B-_Waus6CLJ6sGMxBw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r9alTviRBsmftwftoeSwBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jackie Robinson honored by Twins]&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's number was positioned to the left of the Twins numbers in both venues.

With that new network in place the Twins secured a new Metro Affiliate [[Flagship (radio)|flagship]] radio station in [[KSTP (AM)|KSTP]], 1500Â kHz AM. It replaced [[WCCO (AM)|WCCO]], which held broadcast rights for the Twins since the team moved to Minneapolis in 1961. The original radio voices of the Twins in 1961 were [[Ray Scott (sportscaster)|Ray Scott]], [[Halsey Hall]] and [[Bob Wolff]]. After the first season, [[Herb Carneal]] replaced Wolff. Twins TV and radio broadcasts were originally sponsored by the [[Hamm's Brewery|Hamm's Brewing Company]]. In 2009, Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino became the first ever naming rights partner for the Twins Radio Network, making the commercial name of TRN the Treasure Island Baseball Network.{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/schedule/trn.jsp |title=Schedule |publisher=Twins Radio Network |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}

The 2011 season was announcer [[John Gordon (baseball)|John Gordon]]'s last with the Twins.  He had been the radio voice for the Twins for 25 years.  Gordon started broadcasting for Minnesota in 1987, the year in which the organization won its first World Series since moving to Minnesota.  His trademark phrase is &quot;Touch 'em all&quot; and he shouts this whenever a Twins player hits a home run.  Gordon is 71 years old, and decided to retire in order to spend more time with his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeister|first=Joey|title=Twins announcer Gordon to retire after season|url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/115156014.html|work=Star Tribune|accessdate=March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by Cory Provus, former partner of [[Bob Uecker]] in Milwaukee, in November, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111102&amp;content_id=25871996&amp;vkey=news_min&amp;c_id=min&lt;/ref&gt;

TRN broadcasts are originated from the studios at Minnesota News Network and Minnesota Farm Networks. Kris Atteberry hosts the pre-game show, the &quot;Lineup Card&quot; and the &quot;Post-game Download&quot; from those studios except when filling in for John Gordon or Dan Gladden doing play-by-play while they are on vacation.

On April 1, 2007, [[Herb Carneal]], the radio voice of the Twins for all but one year of their existence, died at his home in [[Minnetonka, Minnesota]] after a long battle with a list of illnesses. Carneal is in the broadcasters wing of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]].

The television rights are held by [[Fox Sports North]] [http://www.foxsportsnorth.com/02/16/11/FS-North-Twins-announce-TV-schedule/landing_twins.html?blockID=411773&amp;feedID=3546 FS-North, Twins announce TV schedule] Fox Sports North February 16, 2011 with [[Dick Bremer]] as the [[play-by-play]] announcer and former Twin, and 2011 MLB Hall of Fame inductee, [[Bert Blyleven]] as [[color analyst]].

[[Bob Casey (baseball announcer)|Bob Casey]] was the Twins first public-address announcer starting in 1961 and continuing until his death in 2005. He was well known for his unique delivery and his signature announcements of &quot;No smoking in the Metrodome, either go outside or quit!&quot; (or &quot;go back to Boston&quot;, etc.), &quot;Batting 3rd, the center-fielder, No. 34, KIRBY PUCKETT!!!&quot; and asking fans not to 'throw anything or anybody' onto the field.

==Team and franchise traditions==
Fans wave a ''[[Homer Hanky]]'' to rally the team during play-offs and other crucial games.

The party atmosphere of the Twins clubhouse after a win is well-known,&lt;ref name=&quot;HttpwwwfoxsportsnorthcompagesvideoPIDFfjGlICsfpbRWWYXg_Suapv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsportsnorth.com/pages/video?PID=4FfjGl8ICsfp815bR3W0WYX6g_Suap8v |title=Twins Auction: Grounds Crew for a Day |publisher=Fox Sports North |accessdate=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team's players unwinding with loud [[Rock and roll|rock music]] (usually the choice of the winning [[pitcher]]) and video games.&lt;ref name=&quot;HttpwwwfoxsportsnorthcompagesvideoPIDFfjGlICsfpbRWWYXg_Suapv&quot; /&gt;

The club has several [[hazing]] rituals, such as requiring the most junior relief pitcher on the team to carry water and snacks to the bullpen in a brightly colored small child's backpack ([[Barbie]] in 2005, [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] in 2006, [[Hello Kitty]] in 2007, [[Disney Princess]] and [[Tinkerbell]] in 2009, [[Chewbacca]] and [[Darth Vader]] in 2010),&lt;ref name=&quot;HttpwwwfoxsportsnorthcompagesvideoPIDFfjGlICsfpbRWWYXg_Suapv&quot; /&gt; and many of its players, both past and present, are notorious [[prank]]sters.&lt;ref name=&quot;HttpwwwfoxsportsnorthcompagesvideoPIDFfjGlICsfpbRWWYXg_Suapv&quot; /&gt; For example, [[Bert Blyleven]] earned the nickname &quot;The Frying Dutchman&quot; for his ability to pull the &quot;hotfoot&quot; â which entails crawling under the bench in the dugout and lighting a teammate's shoelaces on fire.
