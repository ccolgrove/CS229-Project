'''Firebird''' is an [[open source]] [[SQL]] [[relational database management system]] that runs on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], and a variety of [[Unix]]. The database [[fork (software)|forked]] from [[Borland]]'s open source edition of [[InterBase]] in 2000, but since Firebird 1.5 the code has been largely rewritten .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://firebirdsql.org/rlsnotesh/rlsnotes15.html#intro-gen-notes |title=Firebird 1.5.5 Release Notes  |accessdate=2009-09-29}} Firebird 1.5.5 General Notes for rewriting it from C to C++ language&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Within a week of the [[InterBase]] 6.0 source being released by [[Borland]] on 25 July 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Inprise/Borland Introduces InterBase 6.0 Now Free and Open Source on Linux, Windows, and Solaris | date=2000-07-16 | url=http://www.borland.com/news/press_releases/2000/07_16_00_ib6.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041206174134/www.borland.com/news/press_releases/2000/07_16_00_ib6.html | archivedate=2004-12-06 | accessdate=29 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2000-07-25-004-06-PR-SV-SW |title=Borland.com: Inprise/Borland Introduces Interbase 6.0 Now Free and Open Source on Linux |accessdate=2009-01-29 |publisher=Linux Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Firebird project was created on [[SourceForge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=history&amp;id=firebird |title=Firebird History |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prototypical.co.uk/pdf/Interbase.pdf |title=What's happening to InterBase |accessdate=2009-01-29 |publisher=Borland User Group |author=Paul Reeves |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Firebird 1.0 was released for Linux, Windows and [[Mac OS X]] on 11 March 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwnfs.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_old_news&amp;next=Y&amp;skip=2029 |title=IBPhoenix Community News Archive |accessdate=2009-01-29 |date=2000-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; with ports to [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[FreeBSD#FreeBSD 4|FreeBSD 4]], [[HP-UX]] following over the next two months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwnfs.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&amp;page=ibp_old_news&amp;next=Y&amp;skip=2015 |title=IBPhoenix Community News Archive |date=2000-04-11 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on porting the codebase from [[C (programming language)|C]] to [[C++]] began in 2000.  On 23 February 2004, Firebird 1.5 was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/23/201230 |title=Firebird Relational Database 1.5 Final Out |accessdate=31 January 2009 |publisher=Slashdot |date=23 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first stable release of the new codebase.  Version 1.5 featured an improved [[query optimizer]], [[SQL-92]] conditional expressions, [[SQL:1999]] [[savepoint]]s and support for explicit [[Database#Locking|locking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/rlsnotes/Firebird-1.5.5-ReleaseNotes.pdf |title=Firebird 1.5.5 Release Notes |author=Helen Borrie |accessdate=2009-01-31 |publisher=Firebird Project |date=2007-11-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Firebird 2.0 was released on 12 November 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=devjournal&amp;id=djarchive&amp;no_rss=1#00022.jnl |title=Firebird 2.0 Final Release Launches in Prague |author=Dmitry Yemanov |accessdate=2009-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding support for [[64-bit]] architectures, tables nested in [[From (SQL)|FROM clauses]], and programmable [[Lock (computer science)|lock]] timeouts in [[Blocking (scheduling)|blocking]] [[Database transaction|transactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/devel/doc/rlsnotes/pdf/Firebird-2.0.5-ReleaseNotes.pdf |title=Firebird 2.0.5 Release Notes |author=Helen Borrie |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2009-02-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous stable release was version 2.1.3, which added new features including [[Database trigger|procedural triggers]], [[Hierarchical query|recursive queries]], and support for [[SQL:2003]] [[Merge (SQL)|MERGE]] statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/devel/doc/rlsnotes/html/rlsnotes210.html#rnfb210-new-feat |title=Firebird 2.1 Release Notes |author=Helen Borrie |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firebird 2.5.1 is the current stable version. New features included improved [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]], [[regular expression]] syntax and the ability to query remote databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/release_notes/html/rlsnotes251.html |title=Firebird 2.5.1 Release Notes |author=Helen Borrie|date=2011-09-30 |accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The planned 3.0 release is expected to support [[stored procedures]] in languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]], and SQL [[Select (SQL)#Limiting result rows|window functions]] that restrict query results. An alpha version is expected to be delivered in the last quarter of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/roadmap/|title=Firebird Roadmap 2010 |author=Dmitry Yemanov |date=2010-10 |accessdate=2010-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mozilla Firefox name conflict===
In April 2003, the [[Mozilla Foundation]] decided to rename its [[web browser]] from ''Phoenix'' to ''Firebird'' after a trademark dispute with [[Phoenix Technologies]]. This decision caused concern within the Firebird database project due to the assumption that users and Internet search engines would be confused by a database and a web browser both using the name Firebird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/desktop-apps/2004/02/10/new-mozilla-name-rises-from-ashes-39145898/ |title=New Mozilla name rises from ashes |author=Festa, Paul |date=February 10, 2004 |work=CNET News |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute continued until the Mozilla developers issued a statement making clear that their software package was called &quot;Mozilla Firefox&quot;, not &quot;Firebird&quot;. The statement also said that the Mozilla Firebird name was a project codename. On February 9, 2004, Mozilla renamed its browser [[Mozilla Firefox]], thus ending the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/firefox-name-faq.html |title=Mozilla Firefox - Brand Name Frequently Asked Questions |last=Garrity |first=Steven |coauthors=Markham, Gervase; Goodger, Ben; Decrem, Bart; et al. |work=mozilla.org |publisher=Mozilla Foundation |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main Features==
* Full support for [[stored procedures]] and [[Database trigger|triggers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.firebirdnews.org/docs/fb2min.html | title = Get to know Firebird in 2 minutes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Full [[atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability|ACID]] compliant transactions
* Referential integrity
* Multi Generational Architecture (sometimes called MVCC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/multi-version-concurrency-control/|  title=A not-so-very technical discussion of Multi Version Concurrency Control |accessdate=November 21, 2011 | author=Roman Rokytskyy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support for External Functions (UDFs)
* SQL activity can send asynchronous notification events to clients
* Third party tools, including GUI administrative tools and replication tools
* Careful writes - fast recovery, no need for transaction logs
* Many access methods: native/API, dbExpress drivers, ODBC, OLEDB, .Net provider, JDBC native type 4 driver, Python module, PHP, Perl
* Incremental backups
* Full cursor implementation in PSQL

==Storage and index technology==
===The Multi-Generational Architecture (MGA)===
Firebird inherited the sophisticated storage architecture of Interbase. For ensuring the [[atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability|ACID]] properties of transactions, the database engine keeps different versions of each record changed by the active users in the database. When the transactions are committed, the last version of every changed record is marked as the definitive. If transactions are rolled back, the database engine keeps the mark on the original record versions, leaving them untouched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibexpert.info/ibe/index.php?n=Doc.Multi-generationalArchitectureMGAAndRecordVersioning | title=Multi-generational architecture (MGA) and record versioning | work=HK-Software | accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Firebird disk writes are very reduced in comparison with databases that use the traditional transaction log architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibphoenix.com/resources/documents/community/doc_296 | title=Interview with Jim Starkey from InterBase World | work=Marina Novikova, InterBase World |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactions writing data donât block another ones reading it and viceversa, because each one sees its own version of the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdfaq.org/faq44/ | title=What is Multi Generational Architecture (MGA)? | work=The Firebird FAQ | accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of this design, however, have a tradeoff: some maintenance (âsweepingâ) is required from time to time to clean-up old record versions and freeing disk space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/manual/gfix-housekeeping.html | title=Database Housekeeping And Garbage Collection | work=The Firebird Project | accessdate= July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-generational architecture ensures that OLTP and DSS/OLAP operations can be run simultaneously without the delays caused by locking mechanisms found in other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdfaq.org/faq44/ | title=What is Multi Generational Architecture (MGA)? | work=The Firebird FAQ | accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indexes===
Firebird also uses special high-performance index structures and algorithms, making all indexes of the database to behave like well-turned âclustered indexesâ used by other architectures. Firebird index buckets arenât subject to two-phase locking, and Boolean âandâ and âorâ operations can be performed on intermediate bitmaps at a negligible cost, eliminating the need for the optimizer to choose between alternative indexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ibphoenix.com/resources/documents/community/doc_296 | title=Interview with Jim Starkey from InterBase World | work=Marina Novikova, InterBase World |accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
* Firebird SuperServer has a single daemon/server for all client connections, multithreaded with shared cache
* Firebird SuperClassic also has a single daemon/server for all client connections, multithreaded with separate caches
* Firebird Classic uses [[inetd]] to run one copy of the server per client connection, recommended for SMP systems but might have event-notification issues if access is via a firewall
* Firebird Embedded for creating CD-ROM catalogs, single user or evaluation versions of applications; omits some advanced features such as event notification

==Licensing==
The Firebird database engine and its modules are released under an [[open-source license]], the Initial Developer's Public License (IDPL), a variant of the [[Mozilla Public License]] (MPL). It does not force the developer to open the products using Firebird or even custom-derivatives made from its source code; but if the developer chooses to do so, then some terms and conditions should be honored. The IDPL gives the developer the freedom of making proprietary, closed source applications that use Firebird or are based on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/initial-developer-s-public-license-version-1-0/ | title=Firebird: Initial Developer's Public License Version 1.0 |work=Firebird Project|accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and assistance==
Firebird users, like the ones of other open-source projects, can get significant support and assistance on Internet community forums. However, for demanding environments, commercial support is available from the company IBPhoenix [http://www.ibphoenix.com], that has a group of the main developers of the product working for it. Many support options are available, ranging from casual email support to contracts that designate direct and unlimited access to senior support engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibphoenix.com/services/support |title=IBPhoenix support |work=IBPhoenix | accessdate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connectivity APIs==
===Low-level Firebird Native API, Services API and embedded SQL===
The Firebird native API is always used directly or indirectly by all applications or middleware that connects to a Firebird database. It is implemented on the client library, fbclient.dll on Windows systems and libfbclient.so on Unix ones.
&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url= http://www.firebirdsql.org/manual/ufb-cs-clientlib.html | title=The Firebird client library | work=The Firebird Project | accessdate= July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Services API is a special function set for accessing and controlling service administration tasks such as user management, backup/restore and statistics gathering.

Embedded SQL is a technique that simplifies the development of C/C++ and COBOL Firebird applications, by using a [[preprocessor]] called gpre, which allows to embed SQL statements directly into the source code of the host language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.firebirdsql.org/manual/ufb-cs-appdev.html|title=Application development | work= The Firebird Project | accessdate=July 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
