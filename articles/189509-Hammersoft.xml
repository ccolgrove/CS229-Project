'''HTMS ''Chakri Naruebet''''' ([[Thai alphabet|Thai]] à¸à¸±à¸à¸£à¸µà¸à¸¤à¹à¸à¸¨à¸£, meaning &quot;In honour of the [[Chakri Dynasty]]&quot;&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt;) is the flagship of the [[Royal Thai Navy]] (RTN), and Thailand's first and only [[aircraft carrier]]. Based on the [[Spanish Navy]]'s [[Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias|''Principe de Asturias'']] design and constructed by Spanish shipbuilder [[BazÃ¡n]], ''Chakri Naruebet'' was ordered in 1992, launched in 1996, and commissioned into the RTN in 1997.

The carrier is designed to operate an air group of [[Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing|V/STOL]] fighter aircraft and helicopters, and is fitted with a [[Flight deck#Ski-jump ramp|ski-jump]], although by 1999, the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Matador V/STOL aircraft]] were inoperable, and flight operations were limited to helicopters. ''Chakri Naruebet'' was intended for patrols and force projection in Thai waters, disaster relief, and amphibious warfare support. However, a lack of funding brought on by the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]] means that the carrier has spent much of her career docked at the [[Sattahip]] naval base.  

''Chakri Naruebet'' has been deployed on several [[disaster relief]] operations, including in the aftermath of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], and in response to separate flooding incidents in [[2010 Thai floods|late 2010]] and [[2011 Southern Thailand floods|early 2011]]. Outside of disaster relief, most of the ship's other departures from port consist primarily of a single training day per month, and transportation of the [[Royal Family of Thailand]], leading to claims by some naval commentators&lt;!-- the ones cited --&gt; that the ship is merely an oversized [[royal yacht]].&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt;

==Design==
When [[Typhoon Gay (1989)|Typhoon Gay]] hit Thailand in 1989, the [[Royal Thai Navy]], as the main unit responsible for search and rescue missions, found that its ships and aircraft were unable to withstand the rough weather at sea.&lt;ref name=RTNpast&gt;''Past''{{Clarify|What is the actual translation of the page's title?|date=April 2010}}, Royal Thai Navy&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Royal Thai Navy needed a new, high-technology ship to modernize its fleet.&lt;ref name=RTNpast/&gt;

The original plan was to acquire a 7,800 ton vessel from [[Bremer Vulcan]], but the Thai government cancelled the contract on 22 July 1991.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt; A new contract for a larger warship to be constructed at [[BazÃ¡n]]'s shipyard in [[Ferrol, Spain]], and was signed by the Thai and Spanish governments on 27 March 1992.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt; The proposed vessel was based on the design of the [[Spanish Navy]] aircraft carrier [[Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias|''Principe de Asturias'']], which in turn was based on the [[United States Navy]]'s [[Sea Control Ship]] concept.&lt;ref name=Ireland249/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt;

[[File:Chakri Naruebet-Kitty Hawk size.JPEG|thumb|left|alt=Aerial photograph of two aircraft carriers sailing in concert on calm water. The upper ship is smaller, and has a small number of aircraft on its flight deck. The larger carrier, with a flat deck crowded with planes and helicopters, is towards the bottom.|''Chakri Naruebet'' (top) underway with the United States Navy [[supercarrier]] {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}]]
''Chakri Naruebet'' is the smallest aircraft carrier in operation in the world. She [[displacement (ship)|displaces]] 11,486 tons at full load.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt; The carrier is {{convert|164.1|m}} long [[between perpendiculars]], and {{convert|182.65|m}} [[length overall|overall]].&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt; She is {{convert|22.5|m}} wide at the waterline, with a maximum [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|30.5|m}}, and a draught of {{convert|6.12|m}}.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt; The warship has a ship's company of 62 officers, 393 sailors, and 146 aircrew.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt; Up to 675 personnel can be transported; commonly soldiers of the [[Royal Thai Marine Corps]].&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan89/&gt;

''Chakri Naruebet'' is propelled by a [[combined diesel or gas]] (CODOG) system.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt; Each of the two, five-bladed propellers is connected to a BazÃ¡n-MTU 16V1163 TB83 [[diesel engine]] (providing {{convert|5600|bhp|kW}}, used for cruising speed), and a [[General Electric LM2500]] [[gas turbine]] (providing {{convert|22125|shp|kW}}, used to reach top speed for short periods).&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt; ''Chakri Naruebet'' has a maximum speed of {{convert|25.5|kn}}, although she can only reach {{convert|17.2|kn}} with the diesels alone.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt; She has a maximum range of {{convert|10000|nmi}} with a constant speed of {{convert|12|kn}}, and {{convert|7150|nmi}} at {{convert|16.5|kn}}.&lt;ref name=Werth772&gt;Werthem (ed.), ''Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, p. 772&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament and aircraft===
''Chakri Naruebet'' is fitted with two 0.5-inch machine guns, and three Matra Sadral sextuple surface-to-air missile launchers firing [[Mistral missile]]s.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan89&gt;Bishop &amp; Chant, ''Aircraft Carriers'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The missile launchers were installed in 2001.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt; The vessel is also [[fitted for but not with]] an 8-cell Mark 41 [[Vertical launch system]] for [[Sea Sparrow]] missiles, and four [[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanx close-in weapon systems]].&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt;

The carrier was designed to operate an air group of six to eight [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|AV-8S Matador]] [[Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing|V/STOL]] aircraft (a first generation export version of the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]] acquired secondhand from the [[Spanish Navy]]), which were delivered with ''Chakri Naruebet'' as part of a package deal,{{citation needed|date=November 2011|reason=Cited sources do not make the &quot;packaged deal&quot; claim}} plus four to six [[S-70B Seahawk]] helicopters.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ireland249&gt;Ireland, ''The Illustrated Guide to Aircraft Carriers of the World'', p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan89/&gt; By 1999, only one Matador was still airworthy,&lt;ref name=Carp302/&gt; and the RTN was seeking replacement aircraft or attack helicopters.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} ''Chakri Naruebet'' is also capable of carrying up to fourteen additional helicopters; a mix of [[Sikorsky Sea King]], [[Sikorsky S-76]], and [[CH-47 Chinook]].&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt; There is only enough hangar space for ten aircraft.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan89/&gt;

The [[flight deck]] measures {{convert|174.6|by|27.5|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt; A 12Â° [[Flight deck#Ski-jump ramp|ski-jump]] assists V/STOL aircraft to take off.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt; There are two aircraft lifts, each capable of lifting 20 tons.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt;

===Sensors and countermeasures===
The sensor suite of ''Chakri Narebet'' consists of a Hughes SPS-52C air search radar operating on the E/F band, and two Kelvin-Hughes 1007 navigational radars.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09&gt;Saunders (ed.) ''Jane's Fighting Ships 2008-2009, p. 786&lt;/ref&gt; There are provisions to install an SPS-64 surface search radar and a hull-mounted sonar, but neither has been fitted as of 2008.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan89/&gt; Fire control facilities are also yet to be fitted.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt;

The carrier is equipped with four [[Mark 36 SRBOC|SRBOC decoy launchers]],&lt;ref name=Bischan89/&gt; and an SLQ-25 towed decoy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011|reason=Source cited claims that the towed decoy is an SLQ-32, but this may be incorrect in numerical or item identification}}

==Construction==
Work on the Thai carrier commenced in October 1993, although it was not until 12 July 1994 that the hull was laid down.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt; ''Chakri Naruebet'' was launched on 20 January 1996&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt; by [[Queen Sirikit]].

[[Sea trials]] were conducted from October 1996 to January 1997, the latter part of which was in coordination with the Spanish Navy.&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt; This was followed by aviation trials at [[Rota, Spain]].&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt; The carrier was handed over on 27 March 1997, when she was commissioned into the RTN.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt; She arrived in Thai waters at the start of August 1997, and formally entered service on 10 August.&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt;

''Chakri Naruebet'' cost US$336 million to build.&lt;ref name=Carp302&gt;Carpenter &amp; Wiencek, ''Asian Security Handbook 2000'', p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role and operational history==
''Chakri Naruebet'' is the first aircraft carrier to be operated by a [[Southeast Asia]]n nation.&lt;ref name=Bischan88&gt;Bishop &amp; Chant, ''Aircraft Carriers'', p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; She is assigned to the [[Third Naval Area Command]], and her intended duties include operational support of the RTN's amphibious warfare forces, patrols and force projection around Thailand's coastline and [[economic exclusion zone]], [[disaster relief]] and humanitarian missions, and search-and-rescue operations.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janes08.09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ireland249/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carp302/&gt; However, at the time the carrier entered service, the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]] prevented the necessary funding to operate the ship from being available.&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carp302/&gt; Consequently, ''Chakri Naruebet'' is usually only operational for a single day per month for training, with the rest of the time spent alongside as a &quot;part-time tourist attraction&quot;.&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carp302/&gt; The ship rarely leaves the proximity of the [[Sattahip]] naval base, and when she does, it is usually to transport and host the [[Royal Family of Thailand]].&lt;ref name=Werth772/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt; Naval commentators consider ''Chakri Naruebet'' to be less an aircraft carrier and more the world's most expensive [[royal yacht]], while the Thai media have nicknamed the ship &quot;Thai-tanic&quot;, and consider her to be a [[white elephant]].&lt;ref name=Bischan88/&gt;&lt;ref name=Carp302/&gt;

[[File:Chakri Naruebet 2001 stern view.JPEG|thumb|left|alt=A small aircraft carrier photographed from behind as she sails across calm waters|Stern view of ''Chakri Naruebet'']]
Between 4 and 7 November 1997, ''Chakri Naruebet'' participated in disaster relief operations following the passage of [[1997 Pacific typhoon season#Severe Tropical Storm Linda (Openg)|Tropical Storm Linda]] across the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and the [[Kra Isthmus]].&lt;ref name=RTNdisaster&gt;''Chakri Nauebet disaster relief missions'', Royal Thai Navy&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier's main task was to search for and assist any fishing vessels affected by the storm.&lt;ref name=RTNdisaster/&gt;

Flooding in the [[Songkhla Province]] resulted in the carrier's mobilisation in late November 2000.&lt;ref name=RTNdisaster/&gt; ''Chakri Naruebet'' was anchored at an island marina off Songkhla, and used as a base for helicopters and small boats transporting food, supplies, and wounded.&lt;ref name=RTNdisaster/&gt;

In January 2003, [[2003 Phnom Penh riots|anti-Thai riots]] were sparked in [[Phnom Penh]] by incorrect news reports of a claim by a Thai actress that the [[Angkor Wat]] temple complex belonged to Thailand, not Cambodia. ''Chakri Naruebet'' was sent to help with any evacuation of Thai citizens from Cambodia.{{Clarify|Was an evacuation necessary?|date=April 2010}}&lt;ref name=RTNdisaster/&gt;

Following an [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|undersea earthquake in the Indian Ocean]], [[tsunami]]s struck multiple regions around the Indian Ocean, including the [[Andaman Sea]] coast of Thailand. The personnel of ''Chakri Naruebet'' were part of a 760-strong response by the Thai military to the disaster.&lt;ref name=RTNdisaster/&gt; This task force was involved in search-and-rescue around [[Phuket (city)|Phuket]] and the [[Phi Phi Islands]], treatment of wounded and handling of dead, and repair work to schools and government facilities.&lt;ref name=RTNdisaster/&gt;

During the August 2005 filming of ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'', a dramatised [[biographical film]] of US Navy pilot [[Dieter Dengler]] and his capture during the Vietnam War, the flight deck of ''Chakri Naruebet'' was used to represent the carrier {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|6}}.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

In November 2010, the ship was involved in flood relief operations following the [[2010 Thai floods]]; anchored off [[Songkhla Province]], relief supplies and food were airlifted to people in the region, while hospital patients were evacuated by the ship's helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth Times'', ''Thai aircraft carrier used as floating kitchen''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chakri Naruebet'' was sent to [[Koh Tao]] in late March during the [[2011 Southern Thailand floods]], as the heavy storms causing the flooding had isolated the island, requiring the evacuation of tourits and local citizens.&lt;ref name=BP2011&gt;''Bangkok Post'', ''Navy races South to aid victims&lt;/ref&gt;
