[[Image:Microsoft Home.png|right|thumb|Logo]]
'''Microsoft Home''' is a defunct line of software applications and personal hardware products published by [[Microsoft]]. Microsoft Home software titles first appeared in the middle of 1993. These applications were designed to bring multimedia to [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] personal computers. With more than 60 products available under the Microsoft Home brand by 1994, the company's push into the consumer market took off. Microsoft also announced at that time [[Microsoft Plus!]], an add-on enhancement package for Windows, which was continued until the [[Windows 2000]] era. The range of home software catered for many different consumer interests from gaming with [[Microsoft Arcade]] and [[Microsoft Entertainment Pack|Entertainment Packs]] to reference titles such as [[Microsoft Encarta]], [[Microsoft Bookshelf|Bookshelf]] and [[Microsoft Cinemania|Cinemania]]. Shortly after the release of [[Microsoft Windows 95]], the company began to reduce the price of Microsoft Home products and by the rise of the [[World Wide Web]] by 1998, Microsoft began to phase out the line of software. Today, Microsoft Home products can still be found on [[eBay]], [[Amazon.com]] and in charity shops every once in a while, and they are beginning to fetch collector prices.  However, some of them are available for download (albeit [[Warez|illegally]]) from various Internet websites dealing with [[abandonware]].

== Titles ==
Microsoft Home produced software for all different uses and environments. The products are divided into five categories: Reference &amp; Exploration, Entertainment, Kids, Home Productivity and Sounds, Sights &amp; Gear. The category in which the product was divided is identifiable by the package. Generally, Reference &amp; Exploration products have a purple base color, Entertainment has a black base color, Kids has a yellow base color, Home Productivity has a green color and Sounds, Sights &amp; Gear products have a grey or red base color. Note that many applications were developed in conjunction with other reputable software and reference companies. For example, Microsoft Musical Instruments was developed with [[Dorling Kindersley]].
=== Reference &amp; Exploration software ===
Microsoft Home Reference products brought information to [[Multimedia PC|Multimedia Personal Computers]] - it was an effective way of presenting and exploring information before the [[World Wide Web]] became mainstream. These products were embellished with [[hyperlink]] navigation systems, which were relatively new at this time. Most of these products were released on [[CD-ROM]], giving the software the ability to display high-resolution graphics and animations, and play high-quality waveforms and [[MIDI]] files. These products proved that personal computers would revolutionize the way that we find and explore information.

=== Entertainment  ===
In the early 1990s, games on personal computers generally ran on the now obsolete [[MS-DOS]] operating system. However, with the introduction of Microsoft [[Windows 3.1x]] in 1992, Microsoft Home published several entertainment applications that implemented the new technologies of Microsoft Windows. Furthermore, these applications encouraged the [[Computer games|computer gamers]] of the time to migrate from MS-DOS to Microsoft Windows. This transition permitted better use of computer graphics, revolutionized [[game programming]] and resulted in a more realistic gaming experience{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. For example, Microsoft [[Windows Entertainment Pack]] Games have remained a classic for computer gamers, ever since their development in the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

=== Kids ===
[[Image:Microsoftkids.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Microsoft Kids Logo]]
The Microsoft Kids division produced [[educational software]] aimed at children during the 1990s. Their products feature a purple-skinned character named McZee who wears wacky attire and leads children through the fictional town of Imaginopolis, where each building or room is a unique interface to a different part of the software.  He is accompanied by a different partner in each software title.

Microsoft Home's software for kids was popular not only for home use, but also in school and educational institutions. Microsoft proved that the personal computer should not be daunting, but can be used by the whole family. {{citation}}Tying in with the TV series, Microsoft Scholastic's [[Scholastic's The Magic School Bus|The Magic School Bus]] was a highly successful series that continued to be sold after Microsoft Home's kids range of software turned into a subsidiary called [[Microsoft Kids]].
