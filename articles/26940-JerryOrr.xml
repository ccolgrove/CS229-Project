'''Steven Allan Spielberg''' [[KBE]] (Hons.) (born December 18, 1946)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 0-571-19177-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[film director]], [[screenwriter]], [[film producer|producer]], [[video game designer]], and studio [[entrepreneur]]. In a career of more than four decades, Spielberg's films have covered many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as an archetype of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing such issues as [[the Holocaust]], slavery, war and terrorism. He is considered one of the most popular and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema.&lt;ref&gt;''The cinema of Steven Spielberg: Empire of light''. Nigel Morris. Wallflower Press. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He is also one of the co-founders of the [[DreamWorks]] movie studio.

Spielberg won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] for ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998). Three of Spielberg's filmsâ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' (1975), ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982), and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993)âachieved [[List of highest-grossing films|box office]] records, each becoming the highest-grossing film made at the time. To date, the unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $8.5&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide. [[Forbes]] puts Spielberg's wealth at $3.0&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes1&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
Spielberg was born in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, to a Jewish family. His mother, Leah Adler, was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and his father, Arnold Spielberg, was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Steven Spielberg Biography (1947?â)|url = http://www.filmreference.com/film/85/Steven-Spielberg.html|work = filmreference.com|accessdate =January 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his childhood in [[Haddon Township]], New Jersey, where he saw one of his first films in a theater, as well as in [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;Lavinia, DeCastro. [http://courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061019/SPECIAL20/610190418/-1/Haddon_Twp &quot;Haddon Township: Part of a larger whole&quot;], ''[[Courier-Post]]'', October 19, 2006, Accessed March 24, 2011. &quot;Did you know film director Steven Spielberg lived in Haddon Township as a youngster? Spielberg lived in the township from 1950 to 1953 and he is believed to have seen one of his first movies at the Westmont Theater.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his early teens, Spielberg made amateur 8&amp;nbsp;mm &quot;adventure&quot; films with his friends, the first of which he shot at the Pinnacle Peak Patio restaurant in Scottsdale. He charged admission (25 cents) to his home films (which involved the wrecks he staged with his Lionel train set) while his sister sold popcorn.

In 1958, he became a [[Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Boy Scout]], and fulfilled a requirement for the [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|photography merit badge]] by making a nine-minute 8&amp;nbsp;mm film entitled ''The Last Gunfight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Steven Spielberg Sighted in Arizona|url = http://doney.net/aroundaz/celebrity/spielberg_stephen.htm| accessdate =November 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg recalled years later to a magazine interviewer, &quot;My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Magazine Interviews Steven Spielberg|publisher=[[Nickelodeon Magazine]]|url=http://www.nick.com/shows/nick_mag/lookInside/index.jhtml?pagenum=8|accessdate=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 13, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled ''Escape to Nowhere'' which was based on a battle in east Africa. In 1963, at age 16, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called ''[[Firelight (1964 film)|Firelight]]'' (which would later inspire ''Close Encounters''). The film, which had a budget of US$500, was shown in his local cinema and generated a profit of $1.&lt;ref&gt;From Inside the Actor's Studio with James Lipton interviewing Steven Spielberg.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made several WWII films inspired by his father's war stories.

After his parents divorced, he moved to [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], California with his father. His three sisters and mother remained in Arizona. Although he attended [[Arcadia High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|Arcadia High School]] in Phoenix, Arizona for three years, Spielberg ended up graduating from [[Saratoga High School]] in 1965. It was during this time Spielberg attained the rank of [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]].

Spielberg attended synagogue as a young boy in [[Haddon Heights, New Jersey|Haddon Heights, NJ]], an area which did not allow Jews before World War II.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} He attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi [[Albert L. Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DbqATVZHvkQC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Steven Spielberg: A Biography|publisher=Da Capo Press|year= 1999|isbn=9780306809002}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would later be memorialized as the main character in Mitch Albom's, ''Have a Little Faith''.

As a child, Spielberg faced difficulty reconciling being an Orthodox Jew with the perception of him by other children he played with. âIt isnât something I enjoy admitting,â he once said, âbut when I was 7, 8, 9 years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parentsâ Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times. My grandfather always wore a long black coat, black hat and long white beard. I was embarrassed to invite my friends over to the house, because he might be in a corner davening [praying], and I wouldnât know how to explain this to my [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] friends.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Steven Spielberg: 'We Can't Just Sit Back and Hope'|publisher = Parade Magazine|date = March 27, 1994|url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/1994/edition_03-27-1994/steven-spielberg-we-cant-just-sit-back-and-hope.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg also said he suffered from acts of [[anti-Semitic]] prejudice in his early life: he later said, &quot;In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible.&quot;&lt;ref name=faces&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/movies/bestpictures/schindler-ar1.html|publisher=The New York Times|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|date=December 12, 1993|title=Steven Spielberg Faces the Holocaust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving to California, he applied to attend the film school at [[University of Southern California]] School of Theater, Film and Television two separate times, but was unsuccessful. He was a student subsequently of [[California State University, Long Beach]]. While attending Long Beach State in the 1960s, Spielberg became a member of [[Theta Chi Fraternity]]. His actual career began when he returned to Universal Studios as an unpaid, seven-day-a-week intern and guest of the editing department (uncredited). After Spielberg became famous, USC awarded him an honorary degree in 1994, and in 1996 he became a trustee of the university.&lt;ref name=USCtrustee&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/about/administration/trustees/ Board of Trustees], University of Southern California&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calstate.edu/Newsline/Archive/01-02/020514-LB.shtml |title=CSU Newsline â Steven Spielberg To Graduate from California State University, Long Beach With Bachelor's Degree in Film and Electronic Arts |publisher=Calstate.edu |date=May 14, 2002 |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, thirty-five years after starting college, Spielberg finished his degree via independent projects at CSULB, and was awarded a B.A. in Film Production and Electronic Arts with an option in Film/Video Production.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

As an intern and guest of Universal Studios, Spielberg made his first short film for theatrical release, the 26 minute film ''[[Amblin']]'' (1968),&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; the title of which Spielberg later took as the name of his production company, [[Amblin Entertainment]]. After Sidney Sheinberg, then the vice-president of production for Universal's TV arm, saw the film, Spielberg became the youngest director ever to be signed for a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio (Universal). He dropped out of Long Beach State in 1969 to take up the television director contract at Universal Studios and began his career as a professional director.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In 1969, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' announced that Spielberg would direct his first full length film, ''Malcolm Winkler'', written by Claudia Salter, produced by John Orland, with Frank Price being the executive producer. However, because of the difficulty in casting the key male role, the film was not made. Steven Spielberg also attended Brookdale Community College for undergrad.

==Career==
===Early career (1969â75)===
His first professional TV job came when he was hired to do one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of ''[[Night Gallery]]''. The segment, &quot;Eyes,&quot; starred [[Joan Crawford]], and she and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more &quot;mature&quot; films. After this, and an episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' called &quot;[[L.A. 2017]]&quot;. This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on ''Night Gallery'' and did some work for shows such as ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' and ''The Psychiatrist'' before landing the first series episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' (previous episodes were actually TV films).

Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a [[Richard Matheson]] adaptation called ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]''. The film is about a psychotic [[Peterbilt 281]] [[tanker truck]] driver who chases a terrified driver ([[Dennis Weaver]]) of a small [[Plymouth Valiant]] and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic [[Dilys Powell]] was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (''[[Something Evil]]'') was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film length pilot of a show called ''Savage'', starring [[Martin Landau]]. Spielberg's debut feature film was ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that &quot;a major new director is on the horizon.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Spielberg by Joseph McBride, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.

Studio producers [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered Spielberg the director's chair for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a thriller-horror film based on the [[Peter Benchley]] novel about an enormous killer shark. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs.

But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470 million worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as &quot;Jawsmania.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Spielberg by Joseph McBride, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jaws'' made him a household name, as well as one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, and allowed Spielberg a great deal of autonomy for his future projects.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Spielberg by Joseph McBride, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]].

===Mainstream breakthrough (1975â93)===
Rejecting offers to direct ''[[Jaws 2]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxter |first=John |year=1997 |title=Steven Spielberg: The Unauthorised Biography |location=London |publisher=Harper Collins |page=145 |isbn=0006384447}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Superman (film)|Superman]]'', Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], which became ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, ''Close Encounters'' was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other [[Academy Awards]] nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', a big-budgeted World War II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4&amp;nbsp;million dollars worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.

Spielberg then revisited his ''Close Encounters'' project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released ''Close Encounters: The Special Edition'' in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.

Next, Spielberg teamed with ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and friend [[George Lucas]] on an action adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the first of the [[Indiana Jones]] films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by [[Harrison Ford]] (whom Lucas had previously cast in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as [[Han Solo]]). The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). ''Raiders'' is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre. The film also led to Ford's casting in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blade Runner|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ronald Reagan and Steven Spielberg 1.jpg|left|thumb|Steven Spielberg with President [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Nancy Reagan]] after a showing of ''E.T.'' at the White House]]
A year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. ''E.T.'' was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.

Between 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: ''[[Poltergeist (film)|Poltergeist]]'' (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie|The Twilight Zone]]'' (for which he directed the segment &quot;Kick The Can&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1556111/story.jhtml|title= Rewind: Major-Studio flicks that belong in the Grind House|first = Karl|last = Heitmueller|date = April 3, 2007|accessdate =January 2, 2009|publisher = MTV|quote = Ultimate A-lister Steven Spielberg co-produced this big-budget adaptation of Rod Serling's classic '60s TV show....}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Goonies]]'' (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = This way to the children's crusade|first = Richard|last = Corliss|date = January 7, 1985|accessdate =January 2, 2009|quote = he wrote the story and served as an executive producer of The Goonies....|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959559,00.html|journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His next directorial feature was the ''Raiders'' prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'' led to the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]] due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, ''Temple of Doom'' is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984. It was on this project that Spielberg also met his future wife, actress [[Kate Capshaw]].

In 1985, Spielberg released ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]],'' an adaptation of [[Alice Walker]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Color Purple|novel of the same name]], about a generation of empowered African-American women during depression-era America. Starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and future talk-show superstar [[Oprah Winfrey]], the film was a box office smash and critics hailed Spielberg's successful foray into the dramatic genre. [[Roger Ebert]] proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his Great Films archive. The film received eleven [[Academy Award]] nominations, including two for Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey. However, much to the surprise of many, Spielberg did not get a Best Director nomination. ''The Color Purple'' is the second of two Spielberg films not to be scored by [[John Williams]], the first being ''Duel''.

In 1987, as China began opening to Western capital investment, Spielberg shot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s, an adaptation of [[J. G. Ballard]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]] and a young [[Christian Bale]]. The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars, but did not yield substantial box office revenues. Reviewer [[Andrew Sarris]] called it the best film of the year and later included it among the best films of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Andrew Sarris' Top 10 lists 1958â2005| url = http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/sarris.html#y1977| accessdate =October 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two forays into more serious dramatic films, Spielberg then directed the third Indiana Jones film, 1989's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford, Spielberg also cast actor [[Sean Connery]] in a supporting role as Indy's father. The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success, becoming the highest grossing film worldwide that year; its total box office receipts even topped those of Tim Burton's much-anticipated film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which had been the bigger hit domestically. Also in 1989, he re-united with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] for the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'', about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. Spielberg's first romantic film, ''Always'' was only a moderate success and had mixed reviews.

In 1991, Spielberg directed ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', about a middle-aged [[Peter Pan]], played by [[Robin Williams]], who returns to [[Neverland]]. Despite innumerable rewrites and creative changes coupled with mixed reviews, the film proved popular with audiences, making over $300&amp;nbsp;million worldwide (from a $70&amp;nbsp;million budget).

In 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with the film version of [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', about a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. With revolutionary special effects provided by friend [[George Lucas]]'s [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] company, the film would eventually become the highest grossing film of all time (at the worldwide box office) with $914.7&amp;nbsp;million. This would be the third time that one of Spielberg's films became the highest grossing film ever.

Spielberg's next film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', was based on the true story of [[Oskar Schindler]], a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;The screenplay, adapted from [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel, was originally in the hands of fellow director [[Martin Scorsese]], but Spielberg negotiated with Scorsese to trade scripts. (At the time, Spielberg held the script for a remake of ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]''.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Schindler's List'' earned Spielberg his first [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (it also won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]). With the film a huge success at the box office, Spielberg used the profits to set up the [[Shoah Foundation]], a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors. In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.

===1994âpresent===
[[File:Spielberg1990.jpg|thumb|upright|Spielberg in 1990]]
In 1994, Spielberg took a hiatus from directing to spend more time with his family and build his new studio, [[DreamWorks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Army Archered|title = Spielberg to take break after completing 'List'|publisher = Variety|date = June 17, 1993|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&amp;cs=1&amp;query=dark+AND+angel|accessdate =February 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; with partners [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[David Geffen]]. In 1997, he helmed the sequel to 1993's ''Jurassic Park'' with ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', which generated over $618&amp;nbsp;million worldwide despite mixed reviews, and was the second biggest hit of 1997 behind [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (which topped the original ''Jurassic Park'' to become the new recordholder for box office receipts).

His next film, ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', was based on a true story (like ''Schindler's List''), specifically about an African slave rebellion. Despite decent reviews from critics, it did not do well at the box office. Spielberg released ''Amistad'' under DreamWorks Pictures,&lt;ref&gt;(formed with former [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animation exec [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and media mogul [[David Geffen]], providing the other letters in the company name)&lt;/ref&gt; which issued all of his films from ''Amistad'' until ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' in May 2008 ([[#Upcoming projects|see below]]).

In 1998, Spielberg re-visited ''Close Encounters'' yet again, this time for a more definitive 137-minute &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; that puts more emphasis on the original 1977 release, while adding some elements of the previous 1980 &quot;Special Edition,&quot; but deleting the latter version's &quot;Mothership Finale,&quot; which Spielberg regretted shooting in the first place, feeling it should have remained ambiguous in the minds of viewers.

His next theatrical release in that same year was the World War II film ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', about a group of U.S. soldiers led by Capt. Miller ([[Tom Hanks]]) sent to bring home a [[paratrooper]] whose three older brothers were killed in the last twenty four hours of action in France. The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $481&amp;nbsp;million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after Michael Bay's ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]''. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with [[Paramount Pictures]] (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the ''Indiana Jones'' series). Later, Spielberg and [[Tom Hanks]] produced a [[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|TV mini-series]] based on [[Stephen Ambrose]]'s book ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]''. The ten-part [[HBO]] mini-series follows Easy Company of the [[101st Airborne Division]]'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a number of awards at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]].

In 2001, Spielberg filmed fellow director and friend [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s final project, ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' which Kubrick was unable to begin during his lifetime. A futuristic film about a humanoid [[android (robot)|android]] longing for love, ''A.I.'' featured groundbreaking visual effects and a multi-layered, allegorical storyline, adapted by Spielberg himself. Though the film's reception in the US was relatively muted, it performed better overseas for a worldwide total box office gross of $236&amp;nbsp;million.

Spielberg and actor [[Tom Cruise]] collaborated for the first time for the futuristic [[neo-noir]] ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', based upon [[The Minority Report|the science fiction short story]] written by [[Philip K.

Spielberg's 2002 film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' is about the daring adventures of a youthful con artist (played by [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]). It earned [[Christopher Walken]] an Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. The film is known for [[John Williams]]' score and its unique [[title sequence]]. It was a hit both commercially and critically.

Spielberg collaborated again with Tom Hanks along with [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] and [[Stanley Tucci]] in 2004's ''[[The Terminal]]'', a warm-hearted comedy about a man of Eastern European descent who is stranded in an airport. It received mixed reviews but performed relatively well at the box office. In 2005, [[Empire (magazine)|''Empire'']] magazine ranked Spielberg number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time.

Also in 2005, Spielberg directed a modern adaptation of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' (a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks), based on the H. G. Wells book of the same name (Spielberg had been a huge fan of the book and the original 1953 film). It starred Tom Cruise and [[Dakota Fanning]], and, as with past Spielberg films, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM) provided the [[visual effects]]. Unlike ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', which depicted friendly alien visitors, ''War of the Worlds'' featured violent invaders. The film was another huge box office smash, grossing over $591&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.

Spielberg's film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', about the events following the 1972 [[Munich Massacre]] of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being ''Schindler's List''). The film is based on ''[[Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team]]'', a book by Canadian journalist [[George Jonas]]. It was previously adapted into the 1986 made-for-TV film ''[[Sword of Gideon]]''. The film received strong critical praise, but underperformed at the U.S. and world box-office; it remains one of Spielberg's most controversial films to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Yossi Melman and Steven Hartov| title = Munich: Fact and Fantasy| publisher = The Guardian Unlimited| date = January 17, 2006|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1687815,00.html| accessdate =October 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munich received five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture, Film Editing, Original Music Score (by John Williams), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg.

===Themes===
{{Original research|section|date=April 2011}}
Spielberg's films often deal with several recurring themes. Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. &lt;!-- This is especially evident in the [[Indiana Jones]] series. : Archaeologist, adventurer and relic hunter is not really an &quot;ordinary character&quot;--&gt;In an [[American Film Institute|AFI]] interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood,&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 0-571-19177-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = E.T.

A strong consistent [[theme (literature)|theme]] in his family-friendly work is a childlike, even naÃ¯ve, sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', [[Hook (film)|''Hook'']], and ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]''. According to Warren Buckland,&lt;ref&gt;Directed by Steven Spielberg: Poetics of the Contemporary Hollywood Blockbuster&lt;/ref&gt; these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]''. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in ''Jaws'' are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In ''Empire of the Sun'', Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.

The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in ''Hook'' starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of his film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in ''E.T.'', is the most famous example of this theme. In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son &quot;self reliance,&quot; which is not how Indy saw it). Even [[Oskar Schindler]], from ''[[Schindler's List]]'', is reluctant to have a child with his wife. ''[[Munich]]'' depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' is a committed family man, while John Anderton in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.

Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Critics frequently accuse his films of being overly sentimental, though Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised. The influence comes from directors [[Frank Capra]] and [[John Ford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;culture show&quot;&gt;{{cite video| title = The Culture Show| medium = TV| publisher = BBC|date = November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporaries===
In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films. For instance, he has cast [[Richard Dreyfuss]] in several films: ''Jaws'', ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', and ''Always''. Aside from his role as Indiana Jones, Spielberg also cast [[Harrison Ford]] as a headteacher in ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (though the scene was ultimately cut). Although Spielberg directed him only once (in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which he voiced many of the animals), veteran voice actor [[Frank Welker]] has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executively produced from ''[[Gremlins]]'' to its sequel ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'', as well as ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' (and lending his voice to its sequels which Spielberg had no involvement in), ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', and television shows such as ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures|Tiny Toons]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', and SeaQuest DSV. Recently Spielberg has used Tom Hanks on several occasions and has cast him in ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', and ''[[The Terminal]]''. Spielberg also has collaborated with Tom Cruise twice on ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]''. Spielberg has also cast Shia LaBeouf in five films: ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', ''[[Eagle Eye]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'', and ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''. Spielberg prefers working with production members with whom he has developed an existing working relationship. An example of this is his production relationship with [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] who has served as producer on all his major films from ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' to the recent ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]''. Other working relationships include [[Allen Daviau]], a childhood friend and cinematographer who shot the early Spielberg film ''Amblin'' and most of his films up to ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]''; [[Janusz KamiÅski]] who has shot every Spielberg film since ''Schindler's List'' (see [[List of film director and cinematographer collaborations]]); and the film editor [[Michael Kahn (film editor)|Michael Kahn]] who has edited every film directed by Spielberg from ''Close Encounters'' to ''Munich'' (except ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial''). Most of the DVDs of Spielberg's films have documentaries by Laurent Bouzereau.

A famous example of Spielberg working with the same professionals is his long time collaboration with [[John Williams]] and the use of his musical scores in all of his films since ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'' (except ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'' and ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''). One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by John Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience. These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e.g. ''Empire of the Sun'', ''Saving Private Ryan'', the final scene of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and the end credits of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (where they ride into the sunset), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene. Spielberg is a contemporary of filmmakers [[George Lucas]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[John Milius]], and [[Brian De Palma]], collectively known as the &quot;[[Movie Brats]]&quot;. Aside from his principal role as a director, Spielberg has acted as a producer for a considerable number of films, including early hits for [[Joe Dante]] and [[Robert Zemeckis]].

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
From 1985 to 1989 Spielberg was married to actress [[Amy Irving]]. In their 1989 divorce settlement, she received $100&amp;nbsp;million from Spielberg after a judge controversially vacated a [[prenuptial agreement]] written on a napkin. Their divorce was recorded as the third most costly celebrity divorce in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 'Most costly' celebrity divorces|publisher = BBC NEWS|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6552597.stm|date = April 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the divorce, Spielberg and Irving shared custody of their son, Max Samuel.

Spielberg subsequently developed a relationship with actress [[Kate Capshaw]], whom he met when he cast her in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. They married on October 12, 1991. Capshaw is a convert to Judaism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Capshaw&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last =Pogrebin| first =Abigail| title =Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk about Being Jewish| publisher =Bantam Dell Pub Group|year=2005| month =October| isbn =0767916123}}&lt;/ref&gt; They currently move among their four homes in [[Pacific Palisades, California]]; New York City; Quelle Farm, [[Georgica Pond]] in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, NY]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2002/09/19/0919feat_7.html &quot;Billionaires on vacation: No. 80: Steven Spielberg&quot;] by Christina Valhouli, ''Forbes'' magazine, Sep. 19, 2002.

===Hobbies===
Spielberg is an avid film buff, and, when not shooting a picture, he will indulge in &quot;movie orgies&quot; (watching many over a single weekend).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title = [[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]|publisher = [[BBC Two]] |date = January 31, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sees almost every major summer blockbuster in theaters if not preoccupied and enjoys most of them; &quot;If I get pleasure from anything, I can't think of it as dumb or myself as shallow [...] I'll probably go late to that movie and go, 'What the dickens was everybody complaining about, that wasn't so bad!'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Freer|title=Death from Above|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=August 2005|page=99|authorlink=Ian Freer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since playing [[Pong]] while filming ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' in 1974, Spielberg has been an avid video gamer.

Jonathan Norman was arrested after making two attempts to enter Spielberg's Pacific Palisades home in June and July 1997. Norman was jailed for 25 years in California. Spielberg told the court: &quot;Had Jonathan Norman actually confronted me, I genuinely, in my heart of hearts, believe that I would have been raped or maimed or killed.&quot;

==Achievements==
[[File:Steven Spielberg 1999 4 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Spielberg with a public service award presented by United States Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]], 1999.]]
Spielberg has won three Academy Awards. He has been nominated for six Academy Awards for the category of [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning two of them (''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]''), and seven of the films he directed were up for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] Oscar (''Schindler's List'' won).

After watching the unconventional, off-center camera techniques of ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]] praised &quot;young Spielberg,&quot; saying &quot;He's the first one of us who doesn't see the [[Proscenium|proscenium arch]].&quot; Or, to paraphrase, he was the first mainstream director to think outside the visual dynamics of the theater,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reviewed by Owen Gleiberman |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20049410,00.html |title='&amp;#39;The Bourne Ultimatum'&amp;#39; Review By Owne Gleiberman |publisher=EW.com |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although that didnât stop Hitchcock from removing Spielberg from the set of ''[[Family Plot]]'', his last film.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=DbqATVZHvkQC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;lpg=PA255&amp;dq=Spielberg+%E2%80%9CFamily+Plot%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oYUSyI8h70&amp;sig=dMa71xSlyqlGAO4ZRL4mlF8RsNo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eb48TqifJtGSgQf1sJz1Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Spielberg%20%E2%80%9CFamily%20Plot%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

British film critic [[Tom Shone]] has said of Spielberg, &quot;If you have to point to any one director of the last twenty-five years in whose work the medium of film was most fully itself â where we found out what it does best when left to its own devices, it has to be that guy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Tom.

However, Spielberg is not without his criticsâmany of whom complain that his films are overly sentimental and tritely moralistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A.I.

Critics of mainstream film such as [[Ray Carney]] and American artist and actor [[Crispin Glover]] (who starred in the Spielberg-produced ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and also sued Spielberg for using Glover's likeness in ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/popcandy/2002-08-07-candy.htm|title= The amazingly true tales of Crispin Glover|work=Pop Candy|author=Whitney Matheson|publisher= USA Today|date= August 7, 2002|accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that Spielberg's films lack depth and do not take risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = There's no Business like Show Business|author = Carney, Ray|url = http://people.bu.edu/rcarney/carncult/showbiz.shtml|accessdate =March 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Glover| first = Crispin| authorlink = Crispin Glover| title = What Is It?| url = http://thecrispincorner.com/essay.html| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060503191918/http://thecrispincorner.com/essay.html| archivedate = May 3, 2006| accessdate =September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The late film critic, [[Pauline Kael]], who had championed Spielberg's films in the 1970s, expressed disappointment in his later development, stating that &quot;heâs become, I think, a very bad director.... And Iâm a little ashamed for him, because I loved his early work.... [H]e turned to virtuous movies. And heâs become so uninteresting now.... I think that he had it in him to become more of a fluid, far-out director. But, instead, heâs become a melodramatist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Afterglow: A Last Conversation with Pauline Kael]]'' by [[Francis Davis]], [[Da Capo Press]], 2003, pg. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imre KertÃ©sz]], Hungarian Jewish author, [[Nazi concentration camps|Nazi concentration camp]] survivor, and winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], criticized Spielberg's depiction of the Holocaust in ''[[Schindler's List]]'' as [[kitsch]], saying &quot;I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/holocaust/reflections.htm |title=Holocaust Reflections |publisher=English.illinois.edu |accessdate=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veteran documentary filmmaker and professor [[Claude Lanzmann]] also labeled ''Schindler's List'' &quot;pernicious in its impact and influence&quot; and &quot;very sentimental&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Maker of âShoahâ Stresses Its Lasting Value, The New York Times, December 6, 2010 http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/movies/07shoah.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;

[[French New Wave]] filmmaker [[Jean-Luc Godard]] stated that he holds Spielberg partly responsible for the lack of artistic merit in mainstream cinema and accused Spielberg of using his film ''Schindler's List'' to make a profit of tragedy while Schindler's wife lived in poverty in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Bill Gibron|title = Short Cuts&amp;nbsp;â Forgotten Gems: In Praise of Love|publisher = Pop Matters|date = April 21, 2007|url = http://www.popmatters.com/pm/blogs/shortends_post/33421/short-cuts-forgotten-gems-in-praise-of-love-2001|accessdate=April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defense of Spielberg, critic [[Roger Ebert]] said &quot;Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Roger Ebert|title = In Praise Of Love|publisher = Ebert|date = October 18, 2002|publisher = Chicago Sun-Times|url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180306/1023 |accessdate=April 28, 2007|authorlink = Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Rowley wrote an extensive essay about Spielberg and his career in [[Senses of Cinema]].  In it he discussed Spielberg's strengths as a film maker, saying &quot;there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films&quot; and that &quot;Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious&quot;, concluding that he has only received &quot;limited, begrudging recognition&quot; from critics .&lt;ref name=&quot;Rowley&quot; /&gt;

===Other===
In 1999, Spielberg, then a co-owner of [[DreamWorks]], was involved in a heated debate in which the studio proposed building on [[wetland]]s near Los Angeles, California, though development was later dropped for economic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Entertainment Spielberg Studio Plan axed| publisher = BBC| date = July 22, 1999| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/384010.stm| accessdate =October 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, [[Ai Weiwei]], artistic designer for the [[Beijing National Stadium|Beijing Olympic Stadium]], known as the &quot;Bird's Nest&quot;, accused those choreographing the Olympic opening ceremony, including Spielberg, of failing to live up to their responsibility as artists. Ai said, &quot;It's disgusting. I don't like anyone who shamelessly abuses their profession, who makes no moral judgment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Watts, Jonathan|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2007/08/11/2003373696|title=Olympic artist lashes out over PRC propaganda|work=[[Taipei Times]]|date=August 11, 2007|accessdate=July 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
