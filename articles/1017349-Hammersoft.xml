'''El Salvador's national football team''' (''SelecciÃ³n de fÃºtbol de El Salvador'' in Spanish) represents [[El Salvador]] in international [[association football|football]] and is sanctioned by the [[FederaciÃ³n SalvadoreÃ±a de FÃºtbol]] (FESFUT). In 1899, [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]] and [[San Salvador, El Salvador|San Salvador]] met for the first hosted football game in El Salvador. El Salvador's national football team's first match was in September 1921, when they were invited to participate in [[Independence Centenary Games|a tournament]] to celebrate 100 years of [[Central American declarations of independence|Central American Independence]]. 

El Salvador has made two [[FIFA World Cup]] appearances: first in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and again in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], but have never progressed beyond the first group stage of a finals tournament. They were the [[1943 CCCF Championship|1943 CCCF]] champions, and finished in second-place in the [[1941 CCCF Championship|1941]] and [[1961 CCCF Championship|1961]] championships. They have competed in the [[CONCACAF Championship|CONCACAF regional tournaments]] thirteen times, finishing as runners-up in [[1963 CONCACAF Championship|1963]] and [[1981 CONCACAF Championship|1981]]. ''La Selecta'' also competes in the biennial [[Central American Cup|UNCAF Nations Cup]], the [[Football at the Pan American Games|Pan American Games]], the [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]], and have achieved two gold medals in the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]]. 

The [[Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n]], also known as ''&quot;El Coloso de Montserrat&quot;'' and ''&quot;La Catedral del Espectaculo&quot;'', is the official home stadium of the El Salvador national football team. Since 2008, the national team has had a [[Kit (association football)|kit]] sponsorship contract with England based supplier [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]]. {{As of|2011|9}}, [[RaÃºl DÃ­az Arce]] is the top-scorer with 39 goals, while [[Leonel CÃ¡rcamo]] has the record of being the most capped Salvadoran player with 84 appearances. The El Salvador national football team has presented itself with 41 managers in total, in the national team, and currently the head coach is [[RubÃ©n Israel]].

==History==
===Beginnings of the national team===
[[Salvadoran Football Association|Salvadoran football]] had its birth in the city of [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]] on a field called Campo Marte. This was the first time a [[Association football|football]] game was hosted in El Salvador. That first game took place on July 26, 1899 among players from [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]] and [[San Salvador]]. Both teams had several foreign players from England who are credited with introducing football to El Salvador. The local team won the game 2â0.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/historia.html |title=Historia |author=Gomez, Omar |date= |work= |publisher=El Balon Cusctatleco |accessdate=16 May 2011 |language=Spanish |trans_title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although El Salvador played a few games in the early part of the 20th century, they did not become a fully committed national team until 1921 when players such as JosÃ© Pablo Huezo, Carlos Escobar Leiva or Santiago Barrachina revolutionized football in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Name&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hatcher |first=Dan|title=El Salvador Soccer Team Name Ideas|url=http://danhatcher.com/blog/tag/soccer-team-name-ideas/|accessdate=2010-11-01|date=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1921, El Salvador were invited to [[Guatemala]] to take part in the [[Independence Centenary Games]], to celebrate 100 years of [[Central American declarations of independence|Central American Independence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Start&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/especiales/2008/selecta2008/historia.asp |title=Nace la pasion... |author= |date= |work= |publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=16 May 2011 |language=Spanish |trans_title=The passion is born... }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History of the team&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fesfut.org.sv/historia.php |title=Historia del FÃºtbol SalvadoreÃ±o |author= |date= |work= |publisher=fesfut.org.sv |accessdate=16 May 2011 |language=Spanish |trans_title=History of Salvadoran Football}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tournament was compromised as only [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]], [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], and El Salvador were able to participate. By fact, Guatemalans and Costa Ricans had more experience with football than the Salvadorans and Hondurans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/EDH_DEPORTES/figurauydeportes/Portada.pdf|title=el nacimiento de 'la selecta'|publisher=El Diario de Hoy|accessdate=28 August 2011|language=Spanish|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[single-elimination tournament]], or round-robin format, with Guatemala playing Honduras and El Salvador playing Costa Rica. El Salvador, which were dressed with white shorts and black shirt, underwent the classic [[2â3â5]] scheme with Carlos Escobar Leyva; Spanish resident Santiago Barrachina, JosÃ© Pablo Huezo; BenjamÃ­n Sandoval, Emilio Dawson, and Frenchman Emilio Detruit; VÃ­ctor Recinos, brothers Guillermo, and JosÃ© E. Alcaine, Guillermo Sandoval and Enrique Lindo. By the first half Costa Rica had scored 3 goals, and by the final whistle of 80 minutes (40 minutes for each half) won 7â0.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matches&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/elsal-intres.html |title= 1921 to 2008 El Salvador match results by &quot;Barrie Courtney&quot; |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] | accessdate=16 May 2011 | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the loss, this tournament is seen by many as the starting point of the El Salvador national team.

After the 1921 Guatemala tournament, El Salvador only played three other international friendlies against Costa Rica and Honduras. El Salvador lost the first match 3â0 against Costa Rica, while the second and third ended in a 1â0 loss and 0â0 draw against Honduras.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matches&quot;/&gt; On 7 December 1928, El Salvador recorded its first ever win: a 5â0 victory over Honduras, the team that would later become their traditional rivals.  The game was played at Campo Marte [[San Salvador, El Salvador|San Salvador]] and was not only El Salvador's first ever recorded win, but also the first time the team had scored in an international match. On the day, Gustavo &quot;Taviche&quot; Marroquin become the first ever Salvadoran player to score five goals in a single game for the El Salvador national football team,&lt;ref name=&quot;Matches&quot;/&gt; a feat later equaled by [[Miguel Cruz]] and [[Rudis Corrales]].

=== 1930s ===
In the early 1930s, El Salvador appointed its first official national coach, American national [[Mark Scott Thompson]], in preparation for the [[1930 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in [[Havana, Cuba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Directores&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/directores.html |title=Los Directores en La Selecta |author=Gomez, Omar |date= |work= |publisher=El Balon Cuscatleco |accessdate=16 May 2011 |language=Spanish |trans_title=The Directors of ''La Selecta''}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Salvador finished in fourth place at the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdcac&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/jdcac.html |title=El Salvador en Los Juegos Deportivos |author=Gomez, Omar |date= |work= |publisher=El Balon Cuscatleco |accessdate=16 May 2011 |language=Spanish |trans_title=El Salvador in Sportive Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FederaciÃ³n SalvadoreÃ±a de FÃºtbol]], the official governing [[Association football|football]] organization in El Salvador, was founded in 1935. By this time, El Salvador were coached by Spaniard [[Pablo Ferre ElÃ­as]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Directores&quot;/&gt; The El Salvador-hosted [[1935 Central American and Caribbean Games]] took place in the new government funded [[Estadio Jorge &quot;MÃ¡gico&quot; GonzÃ¡lez|Estadio Flor Blanca]], at that time the biggest stadium in the country. The Salvadoran squad consisted of Edmundo Majano as goalkeeper; Tobias Rivera and Raul Castro in defense; AmÃ©rico Gonzalez and Napolean CaÃ±as as midfielders; and Alex Morales, Rogelio Aviles, Fidel Quintanilla, Miguel âAmericanoâ Cruz, and Andres Hernandez as strikers. Previously the national team had worn black and white striped jerseys and this was the first time they turned out in a new blue strip. The team improved their performance over the previous competition to finish in third place as bronze medal winners.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdcac&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAG 1935&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Garin, Erik |coauthors=Morrison, Neil |title= Central American Games 1935 (El Salvador) | url= http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/cag35.html| publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] | accessdate=14 May 2011 | date=21 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1938 the [[FederaciÃ³n SalvadoreÃ±a de FÃºtbol]] had become affiliates of [[FIFA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FIFA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= El Salvador| url= http://www.fifa.com/associations/association=slv/index.html | publisher=[[FIFA]] | accessdate=16 May 2011 | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again the El Salvador national football team participated in the [[1938 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in [[Panama]], which was won by {{nft|Mexico}} with Costa Rica in second place. El Salvador won two games and lost three out of its the five played. A match for third place between Colombia and El Salvador was scheduled but was cancelled due to bad physical state of the players. El Salvador finished in fourth place by goal difference.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdcac&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAC 1938&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Frank Ballesteros, Myk Cameron, Barrie Courtney, Erik Garin, and Neil Morrison |title= Central American and Caribbean Games Games 1938 (Panama) | url= http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/cag38.html| publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] | accessdate=14 May 2011 | date=24 Feb 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940sâ1950s ===
On April 26, 1940, the first national football federation was approved, with Dr. Luis Rivas Palacios as president. In 1941, the first international competition in the [[CONCACAF]], the continental governing body for football in North America, Central America and the Caribbean, the [[CCCF Championship|Central American and Caribbean Championship (CCCF)]] took place in Costa Rica. El Salvador took part for the first time alongside teams from Costa Rica, {{nft|CuraÃ§ao}}, Panama, and {{nft|Nicaragua}}. El Salvador were runners-up, recording two wins, one tie, and one loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCF 1941&quot;/&gt;

The [[1943 CCCF Championship]] took place in San Salvador with the participation of Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. The El Savador team were coached by former national player [[AmÃ©rico GonzÃ¡lez]]. At the end of the tournament, El Salvador and Guatemala ended up with the same number of points and so had to play a tiebreaker. On December 21, Guatemala failed to show up for the match resulting in El Salvador declaring themselves 1943 CCCF Championship winners by goal difference. This was the country's first international title. El Salvador's 10â1 win over Nicaragua set the team's record for the most goals scored in a single game. It was also the second time a Salvadoran player (Miguel &quot;Americano&quot; Cruz) had scored five goals in a single match.&lt;ref name=&quot;CCCF 1943&quot;/&gt; El Salvador participated in the [[1946 CCCF Championship]], hosted in [[Costa Rica]], alongside six other participants. The national team finished in second place, winning three matches and losing two. In 1948, the El Salvador national football team participated in its fourth CCCF Championship, the [[1948 CCCF Championship]] in [[Guatemala]] alongside teams from five other countries. For the third time, Costa Rica won the championship with El Salvador finishing in fifth place.

El Salvador were invited by Brazil but turned down an invitation to play in the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], and did not participate in the playoffs for the subsequent World Cups in [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]], [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]], [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]], and [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. Reasons for these refusals to participate might have possibly be due to economic issues since in those times they had never played so far from home. At that time it had a good quad with players like goalkeeper Manuel &quot;tamalon&quot; Garay, Rafael &quot;chapuda&quot; Reyes, Conrado Miranda, Miguel &quot;americano&quot; Cruz, Rafael Corado and Mando Rivas, to name a few.

At the group stage of the [[1950 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in Mexico, El Salvador recorded two wins, one tie, and one loss. They began the final round by beating CuraÃ§ao 3â1, but lost their other two matches leaving them in fifth place.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdcac&quot;/&gt; In 1953, the El Salvador national football team took part in its fifth CCCF Championship, the [[1953 CCCF Championship]] held in [[Costa Rica]]. together with seven other national teams. Costa Rica became champions for the fourth time, and El Salvador finished in fifth place. El Salvador won their second international title in 1954 under the direction of [[Carbilio Tomasino]], and a team consisting of Yohalmo Aurora, Manuel &quot;tamalones&quot; Garay, Hugo Moreno, Armando Larin, Luis Regalado, Conrado Miranda, Fernando Barrios, Ramon &quot;pezote&quot; Chavez, Jose Hernandez, Mario Montoya, Juan Francisco &quot;cariota&quot; Barraza, Ricardo &quot;chilenito&quot; Valencia, Alfredo &quot;Baiza&quot; Ruano, and Obdulio &quot;calulo&quot; Hernandez. They debuted against {{nft|Colombia}} in a 2â2 tie, beat {{nft|Cuba}} 3â1, beat Mexico 3â2 and finally beat Panama 1â0 with a goal by &quot;Cariota&quot; Barraza. The 3â2 victory against Mexico, with two goals from Mario Montoya (16',36')&lt;ref name=&quot;Minute goal scored&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;/&gt; and one from Ricardo Valencia (37'), was the first victory by a Central American team against Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdcac&quot;/&gt;

At the 1955 CCCF Championship in Honduras, El Salvador's sixth, the national team took part along with seven other participants. For the fifth time Costa Rica crowned themselves champions with El Salvador as 4th place.

=== 1960s ===
The El Salvador football team participated in its seventh CCCF Championship, the [[1961 CCCF Championship]] in Costa Rica, in competition with nine other teams with El Salvador finishing in fourth place. El Salvador hosted the first [[1963 CONCACAF Championship qualification|CONCACAF Championship qualification]] tournament (a replacement for the CCCF Championship) in 1963. There were nine other participants, with Costa Rica becoming the first CONCACAF champions, and El Salvador finishing as runners-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;CONCACAF Nations Cup 1963&quot;/&gt; Chilean [[HernÃ¡n Carrasco Vivanco]] became coach in 1964 and would later revolutionize Salvadoran football. He led the national team for the first time at the [[1965 CONCACAF Championship]] in Guatemala, where they won 2â1 against Costa Rica and 3â1 against {{nft|Haiti}}. The team tied 1 game, losing two eventually finishing in fourth place. In 1966 the El Salvador football team took part in the Central American and Caribbean Games for the sixth time in a [[1966 Central American and Caribbean Games|competition]] that took place in [[Puerto Rico]]. The national team participated alongside seven other teams, finishing in fourth place.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdcac&quot;/&gt;

The first elimination rounds at the CONCACAF level were in preparation for the [[Football at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, Italy, whilst similar elimination rounds were held for Central American members prior to the [[Football at the 1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo 1964 Summer Olympics]]. In 1968 El Salvador qualified for the [[1968 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;olimpicos&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Gomez, Omar | title=El Salvador en Juegos Olimpicos {{es icon}} | url= http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/olimpicos.html | publisher=Elbaloncuscatleco.com | accessdate=2011-08-21 | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They lost 4â0 to {{nft|Hungary}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Hungary 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=FIFA|title=Olympic Football Tournament Mexico City 1968 Hungary-El Salvador|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197099/matches/match=32096/report.html|accessdate=2011-02-08|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3â1 to {{nft|Israel}},&lt;ref name=&quot;Israel 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=FIFA|title=Olympic Football Tournament Mexico City 1968 Israel-El Salvador|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197099/matches/match=32103/report.html|accessdate=2011-02-08|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tied 1â1 with {{nft|Ghana}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghana 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=FIFA|title=Olympic Football Tournament Mexico City 1968 Ghana-El Salvador|url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197099/matches/match=32111/report.html|accessdate=2011-02-08|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coach by this time was [[Rigoberto Guzman]].

Gregorio Bundio and his assistant Jose Santacolomba coached the team in the qualifying stages for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]]. This would be the first time that El Salvador would participate in this qualifying tournament. For this World Cup, CONCACAF would be represented by Mexico (host of the World Cup) and another national team. El Salvador won group 3, playing four games, winning three and losing one. Their record was 10 goals for and 5 goals against with 6 points. As a result they qualified for a 3-game playoff against the group 2 winner, Honduras. Immediately following the match an eighteen-year old Salvadoran girl Amelia BolaÃ±os shot herself in the heart, and was subsequently regarded as a martyr in El Salvador, with her funeral being televised and the El Salvador president and national football team walking behind her coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A game of life and death|url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090606/SPORT/706059844/1100|publisher=The National.ae|accessdate=22 August 2010|author=Simon Kuper|date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;just a game&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Football's just a game ... isn't it?|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-05-12-footballs-just-a-game-isnt-it|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian online|accessdate=22 August 2010|author=Richard Ingham|date=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of [[San Salvador]], which was won 3â0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wars and Peace Treaties, 1816â1991 |last=Goldstein |first=Erik |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=9780203976821 |pages=195â6 |url=http://books.google.ie/books?id=VjWnMm53xQ8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=football+war+honduras+el+salvador# |accessdate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A play-off match took place in [[Mexico City]] on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3â2 after [[extra time]]. As a result of existing tensions being exacerbated by the football matches, on 14 July 1969 the two countries began the a 100 hour long war known as the [[Football War]]. As a result of the conflict, El Salvador and Honduras were disqualified from entering the [[1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;just a game&quot;/&gt;

The final set of qualifying games for the 1970 FIFA World Cup took place against Haiti. The first leg was won by El Salvador in Haiti, 2â1, with goals from Elver Acevedo (43') and Mauricio 'Pipo' Rodriguez (62'). The second lef was lost 3â0. The third game on 8 October 1969 was won by El Salvador with a goal by Juan Ramon &quot;Mon&quot; Martinez (14' a.e.t.). The El Salvador national football team qualified for their first FIFA World Cup, even though it was their first time in the qualifying stages.

=== 1970s ===
In their first ever World Cup Finals appearance, at the 1970 FIFA World Cup, El Salvador lost their first game 3â0 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in Mexico City on June 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belgium1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=FIFA Match Report for Belgium-El Salvador on June 3, 1970 |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/results/matches/match=1747/report.html |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=2010-11-14 | date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second match was played against the [[Mexico national football team|host nation]], Mexico, on 7 June. The game turned on a controversial moment near the end of the first half with the score at 0â0. Egyptian referee Hussain Kandil awarded a free kick to El Salvador in their own half. However a Mexican player took the free-kick, passing to another Mexican player who scored. The Salvadoran players protested vigorously, to the extent of physically jostling Bermudan linesman Keith Dunstan, but the goal was allowed to stand.

&quot;El Pajaro Picon Picon&quot; was a Colombian song written by Eliseo Herrera which was very popular in El Salvador during the qualifying stages of the 1970 World Cup. During a radio show, Mauricio Bohorquez parodied the song, which he named &quot;Arriba con la Seleccion&quot;. That parody became so famous that it became the &quot;official anthem&quot; of the El Salvador national football team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Official anthem&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lacomunidad.elpais.com/deralte/2011/1/17/el-pajaro-picon-picon-y-guerra-del-futbol |title=El PÃ¡jaro PicÃ³n y La Guerra de FÃºtbol  {{es icon}} |publisher=lacomunidad.elpais.com |accessdate=17 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1971 CONCACAF Championship]], which was hosted on [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] soil, El Salvador advanced from the first round with an aggregate score of 4â2 against {{nft|Nicaragua}}. In the second round, El Salvador withdrew from the playoff when they had to play against Honduras with Honduras eventually making the finals. The national team took part in the [[1973 CONCACAF Championship qualification]] process for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] but they did not advance to the [[1973 CONCACAF Championship|final stage]] after they were eliminated by {{nft|Guatemala}} with an aggregate score of 0â2 (0â1, 0â1).&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggregate score&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=El Salvador en eliminatorias rumbo a La Copa Mundo {{es icon}} | url= http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/cm.html | publisher=Elbaloncuscatleco.com | accessdate=2011-04-21 | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was managed by [[Hector D'Angelo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Directores&quot;/&gt; In 1975 El Salvador participated at the [[Pan American Games]] for the first time at the [[Football at the 1975 Pan American Games|VII (7) Pan American Games]], hosted in [[Mexico]].

They debuted with a 4â1 score against Nicaragua on October 14 with 3 goals from [[Norberto Huezo|&quot;Pajarito&quot; Huezo]] and the debut of Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Jovel. Then they played against Brazil on the 15thâfor the first time in historyâand lost 0â2. They ended the tournament by playing against Costa Rica, where they tied 0â0, and wherein [[Luis RamÃ­rez Zapata|&quot;Pele&quot; Zapata]] missed a penalty. They could not proceed to the next stage, and finished at third place in Group D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|author=Garin, Erik|title=Panamerican Games 1975 (Mexico)|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/panam75.html|date=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1977 CONCACAF Championship qualification]], ''La Azul'' played against four other teams on a home-and-away basis. The group winner (Guatemala) and runner-up (El Salvador) advanced to the [[1977 CONCACAF Championship|Final Round]]. In the final round, El Salvador played five games; they won two, drew one, and lost two with 5 points. They finished in thirs place, below Haiti (7 points) and Mexico (10 points).&lt;ref name=&quot;cm&quot;/&gt; In 1978 the El Salvador football team took part in the Central American and Caribbean Games for the seventh time in the [[1978 Central American and Caribbean Games|competition]] that took place in [[Colombia]].  For the fourth time, Cuba was crowned champions. El Salvador finished in ninth place.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdcac&quot;/&gt;

=== 1980s ===
At the [[1981 CONCACAF Championship qualification]], ''La Azul'' and five other teams played against each other on a home-and-away basis. The group winner (Honduras) and runner-up (El Salvador) advanced to the final round. On November 19, 1981, in the [[1981 CONCACAF Championship|hexagonal]] at [[Honduras]], El Salvador beat {{nft|Haiti}} by 1â0 with a penalty kick taken by [[Norberto Huezo]]. {{nft|Honduras}} tied with {{nft|Mexico}}, meaning the national team scored more points than Mexico and qualified for the second time for a [[1982 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], alongside Honduras. In the hexagonal games, ''La Selecta'' won 1â0 over Mexicoâwith a memorable goal from [[Ever Hernandez]] on November 6âand Haiti. The national team tied 0â0 against Cuba and Honduras and lost to Canada 0â1. The national team was under the direction of [[Mauricio Alonso RodrÃ­guez|Mauricio &quot;Pipo&quot; RodrÃ­guez]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cm82&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=La historia de la clasificacion a la Copa Mundo 1982 {{es icon}} | url= http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/cm82.html | publisher=Elbaloncuscatleco.com | accessdate=2011-04-21 | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CONCACAF Nations Cup 1981&quot;/&gt;

In 1982 El Salvador took a 20-man squad (two players short of the normal 22, for controversial and economical problems), coached by Mauricio &quot;Pipo&quot; RodrÃ­guez, to Spain. The team's experience was an unhappy one. In their first match on June 15 in [[Elche]], they were defeated 10â1 by [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], a scoreline that stands as a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] record to this day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hungary1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Did You Know? table| url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=32/results/matches/match=1823/report.html | publisher=[[FIFA]] | accessdate=2006-04-12 | date=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One comfort was that [[Luis RamÃ­rez Zapata|Luis Baltazar RamÃ­rez Zapata]] scored the country's first World Cup goal during the game, albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5â0.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hungary2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= FIFA Match Report for Hungary-El Salvador on June 15, 1982| url= http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=896/report.html | publisher=[[FIFA]] | accessdate=2010-11-11 | date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games: displaying much-improved levels of organisation and commitment, they lost 1â0 to [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] on June 19 in Elche and 2â0 to the then-reigning world champions, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], in [[Alicante]] on June 23.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belgium2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= FIFA Match Report for Belgium-El Salvador on June 19, 1982| url= http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=774/report.html | publisher=[[FIFA]] | accessdate=2010-11-12 | date= 2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Argentina2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= FIFA Match Report for Argentina-El Salvador on June 23, 1982 | url= http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=59/results/matches/match=751/report.html | publisher=[[FIFA]] | accessdate=2010-11-11 | date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Salvador, within many surprises among the Spanish press for the qualification to the 1982 FIFA World Cup, had a terrible experience in personal terms. First of all, El Salvador took 20 players to the World Cup, leaving behind [[Gilberto Quinteros]] and Miguel GonzÃ¡lez. According to [[Luis Guevara Mora]], goalkeeper of the team by that time, the Salvadoran Football Association decided to take a few friends of the association in exchange for such players that had participated in the qualification process. By the way, those ''friends'' never took part with the team in the notorious World Cup but did take a trip around Europe. Some fellow players tried to gather in some money to help pay for the flight. El Salvador took 3 days to arrive to Spain and was the last team to do so. [[Adidas]] sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player. But mysteriously only three white and one blue remained. The remaining uniforms were taken away by the association. They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Someone had stolen the balls that the team would train with. The day prior to the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them and trained with them. El Salvador had never seen Hungary play. The only knowledge that they had about the team was a lone video that they had bought. When Zapata scored against Hungary, some Salvadorans cried out to Zapata not to celebrate the goal effusively because it might make the Hungarians mad. The fourth goal of Hungary was the fault of the deafness of [[JosÃ© Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]. Jovel had received a heavy blow on the cheek and almost could not hear. So when Guevara Mora cried off to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him. The rejection was defective, Mora had left the goal and the Hungarian player only had to push it inside. After the match against Hungary, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff. The continuing matches against Belgium and Argentina were managed by players Jovel, Huezo and Fagoaga.&lt;ref name=cm82-mundial&gt;{{cite web|last=Gomez|first=Omar|title=El Salvador en la Copa Mundo 1982|url=http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/cm82-mundial.html|publisher=elbaloncuscatleco.com|accessdate=2011-08-24|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Even though they had a bad experience in the World Cup, El Salvador had some relieved moments. Jorge &quot;Magico: Gonzalez was considered by the national and international press as the best player. &quot;Magico&quot; Gonzalez stayed in Spain were he played for [[CÃ¡diz CF]], [[Real Valladolid]] and [[F.C. Barcelona|Barcelona]]. Ricardo Guevara Mora, the goalkeeper, was the youngest player to play at the 1982 FIFA World Cup with 20 years of age.&lt;ref name=cm82-mundial/&gt;

In the [[1985 CONCACAF Championship qualification]], El Salvador and 15 other teams were paired up to play knockout matches on a home-and-away basis. With an aggregate score of 8â0 (5â0, 3â0) against {{nft|Puerto Rico}}, El Salvador passed to the first round of the [[1985 CONCACAF Championship|final tournament]]. They were unable to advance to the second round, with 5 points (2 won, 1 tied, 1 lost).&lt;ref name=&quot;cm&quot;/&gt; In the [[1989 CONCACAF Championship qualification|qualifying stages]] they eliminated the {{nft|Netherlands Antilles}} 1â0 and 5â0, and in the [[1989 CONCACAF Championship|final round]] they placed fifth, with 2 points in 6 games (victories were then counted as two points).&lt;ref name=&quot;cm&quot;/&gt;

=== 1990s ===
In the [[1991 UNCAF Nations Cup]], ''La Selecta'' defeated Nicaragua with an aggregate score of 5â2 (3â2, 2â0) at the first round. In the final round, they played three games, drawing in one and losing two. They ended in fourth place and thus did not advance to the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uncaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=El Salvador en UNCAF {{es icon}} | url= http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/uncaf.html | publisher=Elbaloncuscatleco.com | accessdate=2011-04-21 | date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gold Cup 1991&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Mazet, FranÃ§ois |title=CONCACAF Championship, Gold Cup 1991 | url= http://www.rsssf.com/tables/91gc.html | publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] | accessdate=16 May 2011 | date=9 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1993 UNCAF Nations Cup]], ''La Selecta''  played three games, drawing in one and losing two. They ended in fourth place and thus did not advance to the [[1993 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. They were coached by [[Jorge Vieira]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uncaf&quot;/&gt; Also, in the qualifiers, they eliminated {{nft|Nicaragua}} (5â0,5â1), then finished first in a group composed of {{nft|Bermuda}} (0â1 and 4â1), {{nft|Canada}} (1â1 and 3â2),  and {{nft|Jamaica}} (2â0, 2â1). Already in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|final quadrangular]], they debuted by beating {{nft|Mexico}} 2â1, but lost the next 4 games, losing all classification option. They came in third with 4 points in 6 games (victories were then counted as two points).&lt;ref name=&quot;cm&quot;/&gt;

In the first round of the [[1995 UNCAF Nations Cup]], they won their first two games. ''La Selecta'' won Belize 3â0 and Costa Rica 2â1. In the semifinals they lost against Guatemala 0â1, so they had to go for the third-place playoff against Costa Rica. In that game they won by a score of 2â1; goals came from [[RaÃºl DÃ­az Arce]] (18') and [[Jorge Humberto RodrÃ­guez|Jorge RodrÃ­guez]] (21'). For the first time they advanced to the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uncaf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UNCAF Nations Cup 1995&quot;/&gt;

At the [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], El Salvador defeated Trinidad and Tobago 3â2, with goals from [[RaÃºl DÃ­az Arce]] (34', 72' &lt;small&gt;([[penalty kick|pen.]])&lt;/small&gt; and [[Ronald Cerritos]] (50').

After the global stakes in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], this was the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|playoff]] which was closest to a return to a World Cup, which created great excitement among the fans in El Salvador. In the final round, the club finished in fifth place, with 10 points in as many games.&lt;ref name=&quot;cm&quot;/&gt;

In the first round of the [[1999 UNCAF Nations Cup]],  El Salvador tied Guatemala 1â1 and defeated Nicaragua 1â0, with goals from [[Magdonio Corrales]].

This decision by FIFA was based on the fact that the statutes ratified by the FESFUT general assembly in August 2009 had not been formally entered in the country's official register, and that the government had failed to acknowledge the authority of the Normalisation Committee set up to represent FESFUT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suspension1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Suspension of the Salvadoran Football Association | url= http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=1209619/ | publisher=[[FIFA]] | accessdate=2010-11-12 | date=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, FIFA considered that it was not possible for FESFUT to organise the elective general assembly in line with the action plan that had been drawn up, and suspended FESFUT. For the suspension to be lifted, Salvadoran authorities needed to recognize the legitimacy of the Normalisation Committee of the Salvadoran Football Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suspension1&quot;/&gt; The suspension was lifted on May 28. By FIFA lifting the suspension, El Salvador was allowed to participate in international tournaments at both club and national levels. El Salvador's under-21 team qualified for the CAC tournament in MayagÃ¼ez, Puerto Rico. However, CONCACAF made a decision to suspend football at the [[2010 Central American and Caribbean Games]] shortly thereafter. MetapÃ¡n and FAS participated in the CONCACAF Champions League. The Salvadoran referees selected for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] were able to participate in the World Cup. El Salvador will also be able to participate in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Suspension2&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Suspension of Salvadoran Football Association lifted | url= http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/news/newsid=1220034/ | publisher=[[FIFA]] | accessdate=2010-11-12 | date=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2011 Copa Centroamericana]], formerly known as the UNCAF Nations Cup, El Salvador achieved fourth place. ''Los Cuscatlecos'' defeated Nicaragua 2â0 and Belize 5â2, and lost against Panama 2â0. At the semifinals they lost against Honduras once again by a 2â0 score. In the third place match, they lost to Panama in a penalty shootout by a score of 4â5. The team was coached by [[JosÃ© Luis Rugamas]], and qualified for the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. Forward [[Rafael Burgos (footballer)|Rafael Burgos]] received the Golden Boot, with three goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011 Copa Centroamericana&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Lugo, Erik Francisco |coauthors=Torres, Steven |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/gold-cam2011.html | title= 2011 Copa Centroamericana | publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] | accessdate=16 May 2011 | date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panama forced an extra time at 89', when striker [[Luis Tejada]] between several defenders drove a ball that bounced in front of goal and goalkeeper Miguel Montes managed to catch. The play left confused doubts whether the shot from Tejada was with his head or his hand. Eventually, the referee Walter Quesada decided that Montes caught the ball behind the goal line and ruled the goal to a 1â1 tie at the last minute.

For the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification process]], El Salvador were second seed in the playoffs with a first round bye. ''La Selecta'' achieved its first victory and beat the {{nft|Dominican Republic}} by 3â2 but left many doubts in its debut. Despite a scoreless draw at the end of the first half, El Salvador regained its positionâthat being at homeâand won under goals by Rodolfo Zelaya (54', 77') and Christian Bautista (63').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triunfo bueno, marcador engaÃ±oso|url=http://www.elgrafico.com/gol-nacional/13-gol-nacional/17397-el-salvador-0-0-dominicana-primer-tiempo.html|publisher=elgrafico.com|accessdate=7 September 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Salvador won 4â1 to the {{nft|Cayman Islands}}, a score that could have been bigger but the goalposts and the keeper prevented a higher defeat.

Nevertheless, El Salvador showed a more attractive technique and earned the win. The goals were scored by VÃ­ctor Turcios (5'), Steve Purdy (12'), Jaime Alas (44') and Herbert Sosa (pen. 88'). The last being the 1000th goal scored in the history of the El Salvador national football team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Salvador gana y llega a mil goles|url=http://www.elgrafico.com/gol-nacional/13-gol-nacional/18797-el-salvador-0-0-islas-caiman-primer-tiempo.html|work=elgrafico.com|accessdate=14 October 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Estadio cuscatlan.jpg|260px|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n]], El Salvador's national stadium]]

El Salvador's current [[national stadium]] is the [[Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n]] which saw its first game in 1976. Before the opening of the Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n the national stadium was the [[Estadio Jorge &quot;MÃ¡gico&quot; GonzÃ¡lez|Estadio Nacional de la Flor Blanca]] (now known as Estadio Jorge &quot;''MÃ¡gico''&quot; GonzÃ¡lez).

During El Salvador's early run of existence, the team's national stadium was the Campo Marte, a 16 acre of land that housed a ministadium, (now known as ''Parque Infantil'') between 1928 and 1934.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campo Marte&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Guevara, Ricardo |title= El campo para los niÃ±os | url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/EDICIONESANTERIORES/octubre11/VIDA/ | publisher=elsalvador.com | accessdate=22 May 2011 | date=11 October 1999 |language=Spanish |trans_title=The field for the children}}&lt;/ref&gt; Succeeding, El Salvador played at the [[Estadio Jorge &quot;MÃ¡gico&quot; GonzÃ¡lez|Estadio Nacional de la Flor Blanca]] (now known as Estadio Jorge &quot;''MÃ¡gico''&quot; GonzÃ¡lez) in [[San Salvador]], El Salvador. It was first built in 19 April 1932 during the presidency of Maximiliano HernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­nez in preparation for the [[1935 Central American and Caribbean Games]]. On 24 March 1935 El Salvador played its first game at the Flor Blanca against Cuba and won 4â1.&lt;ref name=&quot;Estadio Magico&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Gomez, Omar |title= Estadio Jorge Magico Gonzalez | url=http://www.elbaloncuscatleco.com/estadiomagico.html | publisher=El Balon Cuscatleco | accessdate=19 May 2011 | date= |language=Spanish |trans_title=Jorge &quot;Magico&quot; Gonzalez Stadium}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Salvador played at  this stadium for the [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification#North, Central America and Caribbean (CONCACAF)|1970 FIFA World Cup qualification]], and accomplished to qualify for the 1970 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Estadio Magico&quot;/&gt; A one-off hame was played at the stadium to commemorate a major refurbishment, it was the last time El Salvador played a game in the stadium, on 15 November 2000, against Jamaica in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2002 FIFA World Cup qualification]] process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Estadio Magico&quot;/&gt;

In 1969, EDESSA (Estadios Deportivos de El Salvador Sociedad Anonima) first proposed the idea of a new national stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;EDESSA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= EDESSA primero ideas para la construcciÃ³n del Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n | url= http://www.1572-8.com/aa-company/deporte/estadiocuscatlan/estadio-historia.html | publisher=AA-Company | accessdate=19 may 2011 | date=7 June 2009 |language=Spanish |trans_title=EDESSA first thoughts for the construction of the Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came to fruition when the construction of the new national stadium, the Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n, began on March 24, 1971, with then-president of El Salvador, [[Fidel SÃ¡nchez HernÃ¡ndez|General Fidel SÃ¡nchez HernÃ¡ndez]], breaking ground. There were options for the name such of that of San Salvador, Fraternidad, and CuscatlÃ¡n but, of course, was named CuscatlÃ¡n. After 5 years of construction, the stadium was opened and held its very first game on July 24, 1976, in a friendly match. The game saw [[FuÃball-Bundesliga|German Bundesliga]] champions [[Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach]] play the El Salvador national football team, with the match ending in a 2â0 victory to the German side. The German squad featured [[1974 FIFA World Cup]] champions, such as [[Berti Vogts]], [[Rainer Bonhof]], [[Jupp Heynckes]], [[Wolfgang Kleff]] and [[Jupp Heynckes]]. Also [[Allan Simonsen]], who eventually won the 1977 [[Ballon d'Or]] and later form part of [[FC Barcelona]]. El Salvador aligned itself with [[TomÃ¡s Pineda]] (Mauricio âTarzÃ¡nâ Alvarenga), Guillermo &quot;Billy&quot; RodrÃ­guez Bou, [[RamÃ³n Fagoaga]], [[Carlos Recinos|Humberto âImacasaâ Recinos]], Eduardo âConejoâ ValdÃ©s, VÃ­ctor âPatoâ Valencia, Warner SolÃ­s, [[FÃ©lix Pineda|FÃ©lix âGarrobitaâ Pineda]] (CÃ©sar âPiscuchaâ Acevedo), [[Luis RamÃ­rez Zapata|Luis &quot;PelÃ©&quot; RamÃ­rez Zapata]] ([[Luis Abraham Coreas|Abraham Coreas]]) &amp; [[IsmaÃ©l DÃ­az|Ismael âCiscoâ DÃ­az]] ([[David Arnoldo Cabrera|David Cabrera]]). While Borussia played with [[Wolfgang Kneib]], [[Hans-JÃ¼rgen Wittkamp]], [[Berti Vogts]], [[Horst Wohlers]], [[Dietmar Danner]], [[Hans Klinkhammer]], [[Carsten Nielsen]], [[Uli Stielike]], [[Jupp Heynckes]] and [[Allan Simonsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zelada|first=Victor|title=La primera pincelada azul|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/epaper/20110725/EDH20110725DEP024P.PDF|accessdate=3 November 2011|newspaper=El Diario de Hoy (El Salvador)|date=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that match, El Salvador has used the stadium for almost every major home game, and it is the official [[national stadium|home stadium]] of the El Salvador national football team and the Salvadoran club [[Alianza FC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadium&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Monumental Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n| url= http://www.1572-8.com/aa-company/deporte/estadiocuscatlan/estadio-historia.html | publisher=elsalvadorguia.com | accessdate=2010-11-11 | date=2005-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 25, 1978, EDESSA agreed to sign a 99-year lease of the stadium to CLIMA (AsociaciÃ³n de Clubes de Liga Mayor A) to operate and control which events are held there.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

The Estadio CuscatlÃ¡n also features the following specifications:&lt;ref name=&quot;Stadium&quot;/&gt;

* A 45,925 capacity.
* 15 entrances to the stadium.
* 10 ticket offices available for ticket sales.

{{Main|El Salvador national football team kit}}

El Salvador's traditional first kit colour is blue with white trim, their second kit being white with blue trim. The current home and away kit features the traditional colours with the exception of bold curved trims that run from the center of the neck and open to the sides, forming two panels on the chest that contain the Mitre logo and emblem of the Salvadoran Football Federation. At the center of the kit the Salvadoran national emblem, once again, is shown. The right sleeve shows the national flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Salvador Mitre 2011/13 Home Jersey / Camiseta|url=http://footballfashion.org/wordpress/2011/08/03/el-salvador-mitre-201113-home-jersey-camiseta/|publisher=footballfasion.org|accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Salvador and [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]] announced a new partnership in 2008 that saw them supply the [[Central America]]n national football team with home and away kits, training, and bench wear until August 2010. Mitre, and their Panamanian partner, [[The Harari Group]], designed the kit that El Salvador used. The kit was showcased by the team on February 11, 2009 as they started their [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|FIFA World Cup qualifying]] campaign against [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago national football team|Trinidad &amp; Tobago]] in the [[CONCACAF]] (Central-American Football Union) Hexagonal Cup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitre&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Mitre (El Salvador)| url= http://www.mitre.com/el-salvador.html | publisher=[[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]] | accessdate=2010-11-11 | date=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 2010, the [[Salvadoran Football Association|FESFUT]] extended the contract with Mitre by four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitre 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Mitre and El Salvador extend partnership | url= http://www.mitre.com/news/mitre-and-el-salvador-extend-partnership/ | publisher=[[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]] | accessdate=2010-11-22 | date=2010-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first home and away kit made by Mitre feature a [[watermark]] of the country's national shield on the center of the shirt and some horizontal stripes along the kit. The current kit featured white remains along the neck, at the bottom of the kit, and over the shoulders.

On 6 April 2011 the head coach, [[RubÃ©n Israel]], was presented in a press conference. &quot;First of all thanks to the executive committee for welcoming me in this country and given me such a huge and so pretty responsibility, as is leading a national team&quot;, said the Uruguayan coach. The technical director explained that, &quot;we have come here with our coaching staff to honor the work, beyond the mistakes and successes, the healthy intention is to work on Salvadoran football as a whole, working with major selections, but have a chronogram of action for youth teams, who are the future of the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;New coach&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.elsalvadorfc.com/2011-04-06-israel-hemos-venido-a-honrar-el-trabajo |title= 'Hemos venido a horar el trabajo', Israel |publisher=elsalvadorfc.com |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=17 April 2011 |language=Spanish |trans_title=We have come to honor the work,' Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=&quot;First game&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The final score of the first match has also been considered to be 3â0. Different texts of sports magazines and books on Guatemalan, Salvadoran and Costa Rican football history do not agree with the result obtained.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Minute goal scored&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Some notes in this article indicate the time at which a goal was scored; for example, (30') indicates that a goal was scored at the 30th minute. This may also be combined by other goals scored by one player; for example, (30',63') indicates that 2 goals were scored at the 30th minute and 63rd minute by one playerâwhich should be noted right before.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggregate score&quot; group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Some notes in this article indicate the 2 scores that add to the aggregate score; for example, (2â0,1â1) results in an aggregate score of 3â1â2â0 being the first match played and 1â1 being the second match played.&lt;/ref&gt;
