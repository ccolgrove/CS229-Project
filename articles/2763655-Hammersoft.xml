'''Investigation Discovery''' (commercially abbreviated and stylized as '''ID.''') is a [[Television Network|television network]] that is owned by [[Discovery Communications]]. The channel features [[documentary]]-style programming dealing with criminal investigations   (primarily homicides), and other crime-related documentaries.

==History==
The channel launched in 1996 under the name '''Discovery Civilization Network: The World History and Geography Channel'''. It was one of four digital networks rolled out by Discovery Communications simultaneously in October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.realscreen.com/articles/magazine/19990401/25107.html?page=3|title=Digital Play in the U.S. of A.|publisher=Realscreen|date=April 1, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the channel had surfaced in November 1994, when its working name was &quot;'''Time Traveler'''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4895/is_199411/ai_n17979053/|title=Discovery plans launch of four newly created nets. (Discovery Communications Inc.)|publisher=Multichannel News|date=November 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, [[The New York Times|New York Times]] Television and Discovery Communications announced a joint venture to run the '''Discovery Civilization Channel'''. By then, it was available in 14 million households. The partnership aimed to complement the historical shows, with programming about current events and contemporary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The New York Times Company and Discovery Communications, Inc. Announce Joint Venture in Discovery Civilization Channel|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=April 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, the channel was rebranded as '''Discovery Times''', focusing more on [[United States|American]] culture and programming pertaining to the well-being and culture of the people of [[United States|America]], as well as other miscellaneous programming. The previous name was described as &quot;is a little off-message&quot; by executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/board-management-changes/6242920-1.html|title='Civilization' Seeks Current-Affairs Niche|date=November 4, 2002|publisher=Multichannel News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Discovery Civilization Channel]] has continued to exist as a [[digital cable]] [[specialty channel]] in Canada.

In April 2006, the New York Times sold its stake in Discovery Times back to Discovery Communications, ending its ownership in the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/node/32855 |title=Discovery Times to Sell Stake|publisher=New York Observer|date=2006-04-13|accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2006, the network's on-air identity was rebranded by creative studio [[Trollback + Company]].
On January 27, 2008, Discovery Times was renamed &quot;Investigation Discovery&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Discovery Investigates|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/columnists/ny-torchwood5550766jan26,0,5830607.column |quote=Tomorrow, the Discovery Times digital channel morphs into Investigation Discovery. (ID, get it?) Premiere night features &quot;Deadly Women&quot; (tomorrow at 8 p.m.), about female killers, and a related episode of &quot;48 Hours: Hard Evidence&quot; (tomorrow at 9 p.m., all on ID).

In addition to the television network, an Investigation Discovery website was also launched. Contributors to the website include crime writers [[David Lohr]], Corey Mitchell, and Gary C. King.

The channel's simulcast '''Investigation Discovery HD''' is available on select [[Time Warner Cable]] and Comcast systems. In September 2009 testing on the Dish Network satellite system for Investigation Discovery HD had begun, and was rolled out before the beginning of 2010.
