'''702 ABC Sydney''' (official call sign: '''2BL''') is an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio station in Sydney, Australia. It is the flagship station in the [[ABC Local Radio]] network and broadcasts on 702 [[hertz|kHz]] on the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] dial.

702 ABC Sydney was the first full-time radio station in Australia, having commenced broadcasting on 13 November 1923. Its first callsign was ''2SB'' where ''2'' denotes the [[States and territories of Australia|State]] of [[New South Wales]] and ''SB'' stood for '''S'''ydney '''B'''roadcasting Limited. However, the callsign was soon altered to ''2BL'' for '''B'''roadcasting '''L'''imited.

2BL became one of the inaugural stations in the ABC network when it was founded in 1932. 2BL was re-branded as 702 ABC Sydney in 2000.

In the sixth radio ratings survey of 2009, [[Nielsen Media Research]] recorded 702's share of the Sydney radio market as the second largest at 9.5%, behind commercial talk station [[2GB]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.nielsen.com/site/documents/Metro609.pdf Radio Survey #6 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
