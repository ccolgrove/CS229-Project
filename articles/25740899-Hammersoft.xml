[[File:John F Kennedy Official Portrait.jpg|thumb|right|[[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]]]

The following is a '''timeline of the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Presidency]] of [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]]''', also known as the '''Kennedy Administration''', which took place from [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy|his inauguration]] on January 20, 1961, to [[John F. Kennedy assassination|his assassination]] on November 22, 1963 - a span of 1,036 days. The timeline also includes major events preceding and succeeding his presidency.

The timeline begins on January 2, 1960, just over a year before Kennedy's inauguration on January 20, 1961, when then-Senator John F. Kennedy first announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination for [[President of the United States]], and concludes on November 25, 1963, just three days after his assassination in Dallas, Texas abruptly ended his Presidency, when the slain President Kennedy's funeral was held, attended by representatives from over 90 countries.

After Kennedy's assassination, in accordance with [[United States presidential line of succession#Constitutional foundation|Constitutional procedure in the case of the death of the President]], his Vice President, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], succeeded to the Office of the Presidency and took the [[oath of office of the President of the United States]] aboard [[Air Force One]] less than an hour after Kennedy died. Johnson served out the remainder of Kennedy's term, and was elected to the Presidency in his own right in a landslide in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]], setting an electoral victory result which has not been exceeded by a Democratic presidential nominee since.

Kennedy was the first Catholic President, the youngest elected President ([[Theodore Roosevelt]], who succeeded to the Presidency after [[William McKinley assassination|William McKinley's assassination]], was younger), and the fourth President to be assassinated.
