''' Mohammed Gassid Kadhim Al-Jaberi''' ({{lang-ar|'''ÙØ­ÙØ¯ ÙØ§ØµØ¯ ÙØ§Ø¸Ù Ø§ÙØ¬Ø§Ø¨Ø±Ù'''}}, born 10 December 1986 in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]), simply known as '''Mohammed Gassid''' (also spelled as '''Mohammed Kassid'''), is an [[Iraq]]i [[Association football|footballer]]. He currently plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Arbil FC]] and the [[Iraq national football team]].

His older brother [[Wissam Gassid]] is also a goalkeeper, and plays for [[Al-Shorta]].

==Club career==
Kadhim played one season for Shabab [[Al-Karkh]] before joining [[Al-Naft]]. He then secured a move in 2005 to Al Shorta.

==International career==
Despite generally playing second fiddle to first-choice goalkeeper Noor Sabri, Mohammed Kassid has shown himself to be more than capable of stepping up to become No1. 
Born in December 1986, Kassid started his career inspired by older brother Wissam Kassid, who keeps goal for Iraqi club Al Quwa Al Jawiya. Like Wissam, Mohammed quickly found fame as a talented keeper and his talent was soon discovered by Bagdad-based club Al Karkh, where he cut his teeth as a teenager between 2003 and 2004. After spending a year with Al Naft, he then moved to another capital-based club, six-time Iraqi champions Al Shorta, making 36 appearances for the senior side in three seasons.

Kassid's excellent displays at club level didn't go unnoticed and he was involved with both the Iraqi U-17 and U-20 sides before earning promotion to the Olympic squad charged with qualifying for Beijing 2008, where he made the No1 shirt his own. 

It was no surprise when he broke into the national senior side under Brazilian coach Jorvan Vieira, who guided the team to the title at the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Although he was left warming the bench while Sabri excelled throughout Iraq's triumphant campaign, Kassid didn't spend his time merely watching. The lessons he learned from Sabri's heroics benefited his own development and, in the FIFA Confederations Cup South Africa 2009, he started for his country in all three games, conceding just one goal and ranking amongst the best players in the tournament statistically (by virtue of the Castrol index).

In 2010 he joined Iraqi Super league rivels Arbil FC along with club teammate [[Mustafa Ahmad]]

He was also selected as the second best goalkeeper in [[Confederations Cup 2009]].

== Honours ==
=== Country ===
* '''[[2007 Asian Cup]] winner'''
* [[Football at the 2006 Asian Games|2006 Asian Games]] Silver medallist.
