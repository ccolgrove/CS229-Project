'''Pocahontas''' (born '''Matoaka''', and later known as '''Rebecca Rolfe''', c. 1595&amp;nbsp;â March 1617) was a [[Virginia Indian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://virginiaindians.pwnet.org/lesson_plans/Heritage%20Trail_2ed.pdf Karenne Wood, ed., ''The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail''], Charlottesville, VA: Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; notable for her association with the colonial settlement at [[Jamestown, Virginia]].  She was the daughter of [[Chief Powhatan]], the head of a network of tributary tribal nations in [[Tidewater Virginia]]. In a well-known historical anecdote that may or may not be true, she is said to have saved the life of Indian captive [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] in 1607 by placing her head upon his own when her father raised his war club to execute him.

Pocahontas was captured by the English during Anglo-Indian hostilities in 1613, and held for ransom. During her captivity, she converted to Christianity and took the name Rebecca. When the opportunity arose for her to return to her people, she chose to remain with the English. In April 1614, she married tobacco planter [[John Rolfe]], and, in January 1615, bore him a son, [[Thomas Rolfe]].

In 1616, the Rolfes traveled to London. Pocahontas was presented to English society as an example of the civilized &quot;savage&quot; in hopes of stimulating investment in the Jamestown settlement.  She became something of a celebrity, was elegantly fÃªted, and attended a masque at [[Whitehall Palace]]. In 1617, the Rolfes set sail for home, but Pocahontas died at [[Gravesend]] of unknown causes. She was buried in England, but her resting place is not known.

Numerous places, landmarks, and products in the United States have been named after Pocahontas. Her story has been romanticized over the years, and she is the subject of art, literature, and film. Her descendants through her son Thomas include members of the [[First Families of Virginiaâ]], [[First Lady of the United States|First Ladies]] [[Edith Wilson]] and [[Nancy Reagan]], and astronomer [[Percival Lowell]].

==Early life==
Pocahontas's birth year is unknown, but some historians estimate it to have been around 1595 based on the accounts of [[John Smith (explorer)|Captain John Smith]]. In ''A True Relation of Virginia'' (1608), Smith described the Pocahontas he met in the spring of 1608 as being &quot;a child of {{Sic|ten|ne|hide=yes}} years old&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith93&quot;&gt;Smith, [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/jamestown-browse?id=J1007 ''True Relation''], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter written in 1616, he again described her as she was in 1608, but this time she had grown slightly to &quot;a child of twelve or thirteen years of age&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Letter to Queen Anne&quot;&gt;Smith.{{cite web

Pocahontas was the daughter of [[Chief Powhatan|Powhatan]], the paramount chief of [[Tsenacommacah]], an alliance of about thirty  [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] groups and petty chiefdoms in [[Tidewater Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Huber, Margaret Williamson (January 12, 2011).

Retrieved February 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, whose name and specific group of origin are unknown, was one of dozens of wives taken by Powhatan; each wife gave him a single child and then was sent back to her village to be supported by the paramount chief until she found another husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;RountreeHelen&quot;&gt;Rountree, Helen C.

Retrieved February 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocahontas's childhood was probably little different from that of most girls who lived in Tsenacommacah. She learned how to perform what was considered to be women's work, which included foraging for food and firewood, farming, and searching for the plant materials used in building thatched houses.&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, Helen C.

===Names===
At the time Pocahontas was born, it was common for the Algonquian-speaking Virginia Indians to be given several personal names. Bestowed at different times, the names carried different meanings and might be used in different contexts. It was not uncommon for American Indians to have more than one name at the same time, to have secret names that only a select few knew, and to change their names on important occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, Helen C. (November 3, 2010). [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Personal_Names_by_Early_Virginia_Indians_Uses_of &quot;Uses of Personal Names by Early Virginia Indians&quot;]. [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/ Encyclopedia Virginia]. Retrieved February 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Pocahontas was no different. Early in her life she was given a secret name, Matoaka, but later she was also known as Amonute. None of these names can be translated.&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''Love and Hate'', p. 66; Rountree, Helen C. (January 25, 2011). [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Pocahontas_d_1617 &quot;Pocahontas (d. 1617)&quot;. [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/ Encyclopedia Virginia]. Retrieved February 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Pocahontas was a childhood nickname that probably referred to her frolicsome nature; according to the colonist [[William Strachey]], it meant &quot;little wanton&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Strachey, ''Historie'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century historian [[William Stith]] claimed that &quot;her real name, it seems, was originally Matoax, which the Indians carefully concealed from the English and changed it to Pocahontas, out of a superstitious fear, lest they, by the knowledge of her true name, should be enabled to do her some hurt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sith, ''History of the First Discovery and Settlement of Virginia''. p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the anthropologist Helen C. Rountree, Pocahontas &quot;revealed [her secret name] to the English only after she had taken another religiousâbaptismalâname, Rebecca&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, Helen C. (November 3, 2010) [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Personal_Names_by_Early_Virginia_Indians_Uses_of &quot;Uses of Personal Names by Early Virginia Indians&quot;]. [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/ Encyclopedia Virginia]. Retrieved February 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocahontas's Christian name, Rebecca, may have been a symbolic gesture to [[Rebecca]] of the [[Book of Genesis]] who, as the mother of [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]], was the mother of two &quot;nations&quot;, or distinct peoples. Pocahontas, as an American Indian marrying an Englishman, may have been seen by herself and by her contemporaries as being also, potentially, the mother of two nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopediavirginia.org/media_player?mets_filename=evm00000020mets.xml &quot;Pocahontas&quot;].

===Title and status===
For hundreds of years after her death, Pocahontas was considered in popular culture, and even by many academics, to be a [[princess]]. In 1841, William Watson Waldron of [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in Ireland, published ''Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems'', calling Pocahontas &quot;the beloved and only surviving daughter of the king&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, William Watson. [http://books.google.com/books?id=PfUSAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=pocahontas%20princess&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems''] (New York: Dean and Trevett, 1841), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; His point of view was typical: by being the daughter of the paramount chief Powhatanââwho was often called a &quot;king&quot; or an &quot;emperor&quot; by the English colonistsââshe must necessarily be a princess. As late as 1969, the historian Grace Steele Woodward authored ''Pocahontas'', a biography in which she referred to her subject as &quot;a young Powhatan Indian princess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Grace Steele. [http://books.google.com/books?id=IVLPVUnPESIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=pocahantas%20princess&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Pocahontas''] (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1969) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, Pocahontas was a favorite of her father'sââhis &quot;delight and darling&quot;, according to the colonist [[Ralph Hamor|Captain Ralph Hamor]]&lt;ref&gt;Hamor, ''True Discourse''. p. 802.&lt;/ref&gt;ââbut she was not a princess in the conventional European sense of the word. She was not in line to inherit a position as a ''[[weroance]]'', or subchief, let alone her father's exalted rank of ''mamanatowick'', or paramount chief. Some women did become ''weroansquas'', or female chiefs, and Powhatan's brothers, sisters, and his sisters' children all stood in line to succeed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;RountreeHelen_b&quot;&gt;Rountree, Helen C. (January 25, 2011). [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Pocahontas_d_1617 &quot;Pocahontas (d. 1617)&quot;]. [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/ Encyclopedia Virginia]. Retrieved February 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''A Map of Virginia'' John Smith explained how matrilineal inheritance worked among the Powhatans:

{{Bquote|His [Powhatan's] kingdome descendeth not to his sonnes nor children: but first to his brethren, whereof he hath 3 namely Opitchapan, Opechanncanough, and Catataugh; and after their decease to his sisters. First to the eldest sister, then to the rest: and after them to the heires male and female of the eldest sister; but never to the heires of the males.}}

In addition, Pocahontas's mother's status was probably lowly. In his ''Relation of Virginia'' (1609), the colonist [[Henry Spelman of Jamestown|Henry Spelman]], who had lived among the American Indians serving as an interpreter, noted Powhatan's many wives. Each wife gave the paramount chief one child, after which she not only resumed her status as a commoner but was also sent back where she had come from.&lt;ref&gt;Spelman, ''Relation''. 1609.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interactions with the English==
===&quot;Saving&quot; John Smith===
[[Image:Pocahontas-saves-Smith-NE-Chromo-1870.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.3|In this [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]] credited to the New England Chromo. Lith. Company, ca. 1870, Pocahontas saves the life of John Smith. The scene is idealized and relies on stereotypes of American Indians rather than reliable information about the particulars of this historical moment. There are no mountains in Tidewater Virginia, for example, and the Powhatan Indians lived not in [[tipi]]s but in thatched houses. And the scene that Smith famously described in his ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles|Generall Historie]]'' (1624) did not take place outdoors but in a [[longhouse]].]]

Pocahontas is most famously linked to the English colonist Captain John Smith, who arrived in Virginia with just more than a hundred other settlers in April 1607. After building a fort on a marshy peninsula poking out into the [[James River]], the Englishmen had numerous encounters over the next several months with the American Indians of Tsenacommacah, some of them friendly, some hostile. Then, in December 1607, while exploring on the [[Chickahominy River]], Smith was captured by a hunting party led by Powhatan's younger brother (or close relative) [[Opechancanough]] and brought to Powhatan's capital at [[Werowocomoco]]. In his 1608 account, Smith described a large feast followed by a long talk with Powhatan. He does not mention Pocahontas in relation to his capture; in fact, in this account, he does not meet Pocahontas for the first time until a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/html/display.php?docs=smith_truerelation.xml&amp;action=show Smith, ''A True Relation''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616, however, Smith wrote a letter to [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] in anticipation of Pocahontas's visit to England. In this new account, his capture included the threat of his own death: &quot;... at the minute of my execution&quot;, he wrote, &quot;she [Pocahontas] hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Letter to Queen Anne&quot;/&gt;

Eight years later, in his ''Generall Historie'', Smith expanded upon the story. Writing about himself in the third person, he explained that after he was captured and taken to the paramount chief, &quot;two great stones were brought before Powhatan: then as many as could layd hands on him [Smith], dragged him to them, and thereon laid his head, and being ready with their clubs, to beate out his braines, Pocahontas the Kings dearest daughter, when no intreaty could prevaile, got his head in her armes, and laid her owne upon his to save him from death&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/smith/smith.html Smith, ''Generall Historie'', p. 49.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have long expressed doubts that the story of Pocahontas saving Smith occurred as told in these later accounts. The anthropologist Helen C. Rountree has argued that Smith's first &quot;version of events [i.e., that he was interviewed by Powhatan] makes sense, given how eager the Indian leadership was to find out why the English had come and stayed in Virginia.&quot;
Smith may have exaggerated or invented the account to enhance Pocahontas's standing. On the other hand, he may have been telling the truth. Some scholars have argued that the absence of the episode in Smith's earlier works should not be definitive evidence that it did not happen. Historian [[J. A. Leo Lemay]], for instance, noted in his 1992 book that, as Smith's earlier writing was primarily concerned with geographical and ethnographic matters, he had no reason then to recount the story of Pocahontas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html Stan Birchfield, &quot;Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?&quot;], PhD student, Stanford University, Updated March 3, 1998. Retrieve September 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Stan Birchfield has written that &quot;Smith's writings are perfectly consistent with the truthfulness of the episode&quot;, but he does not take into account the strong implication, in Smith's ''True Relation'', that he did not first meet Pocahontas until the spring of 1608.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html Stan Birchfield, &quot;Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?&quot;], PhD student, Stanford University, Updated March 23, 1998. Retrieved February 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''True Travels'' (1630), Smith told a similar story of having been rescued by the intervention of a young girl after having been captured in 1602 by [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in Hungary.  The historian Karen Ordahl Kupperman has suggested that he &quot;presented those remembered events from decades earlier&quot; when telling the story of Pocahontas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=RJ9s-cvaLBUC&amp;dq=The+Jamestown+Project&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WGSySqWTFIO6NbuxoMkL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Karen Ordahl Kupperman, ''The Jamestown Project''], Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2007, 51â60, 125-6&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, his story may have grown taller over time. A different theory suggests that Smith may have misunderstood what had happened to him in Powhatan's [[longhouse]]. Rather than the near victim of an execution, he may have been subject to a tribal ritual intended to symbolize his death and rebirth as a member of the tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Gleach, ''Powhatan's World'', pp. 118â121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Kupperman&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=s_9RBlbeZK8C&amp;dq=Indians+and+English:+Facing+Off+in+Early+America&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6cEy8_KgTK&amp;sig=OSgB-I7CSOcNRWCeYS3TPz18t5c&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-GSySsPOJYS6NfLl1cUL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Karen Ordahl Kupperman, ''Indians and English''], pp. 114, 174.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this theory is unlikely being as that little is known of Powhatan rituals, nor is there evidence of similar rituals among other North American Indian groups.&lt;ref name = &quot;Price243-4&quot;&gt;Price, pp. 243â244&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Margaret Williamson Huber has argued that Powhatan, in this case, was being politically pragmatic by attempting to bring Smith, and so the English, into his chiefdom. According to Huber, Powhatan attempted to offer Smith rule of the town of Capahosic, which was close to Powhatan's capital at Werowocomoco. In this way, the paramount chief hoped to keep Smith and his men &quot;nearby and better under control&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Huber, Margaret Williamson (January 12, 2010).

Early histories did establish that Pocahontas befriended Smith and the Jamestown colony. Pocahontas often went to the settlement and played games with the boys there.&lt;ref&gt;Strachey, ''Historie'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; When the colonists were starving, &quot;every once in four or five days, Pocahontas with her attendants brought him [Smith] so much provision that saved many of their lives that else for all this had starved with hunger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''General History'', p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; As the colonists expanded their settlement further, the Virginia Indians felt their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.

In late 1609, an injury from a gunpowder explosion forced Smith to return to England for medical care. The English told the American Indians that Smith was dead. Pocahontas believed that account until she learned that he was living in England when she traveled there several years later, already the wife of John Rolfe.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Generall Historie'', 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the colonist [[William Strachey]], Pocahontas married a common warrior called Kocoum at some point before 1612. Nothing more is known about this marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Strachey, ''Historie'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; It likely ended, according to American Indian custom, when Pocahontas was captured by the English in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, Helen C.

Historical records do not suggest that Smith and Pocahontas were lovers. The romance is featured only (but repeatedly) in fictional versions of their relationship (such as the 1995 [[Pocahontas (1995 film)|animated film by Walt Disney]]). The first romance was written about them in the early 19th century, suggesting the story's mythic appeal. Accounts of such a romance have been repeated in films made in the United States as late as 2009.

Pocahontas's capture occurred in the context of the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars|First Anglo-Powhatan War]], a conflict between the Jamestown settlers and the American Indians that began late in the summer of 1609.&lt;ref&gt;Fausz, J. Frederick. &quot;An 'Abundance of Blood Shed on Both Sides': England's First Indian War, 1609â1614&quot;. ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' 98:1 (January 1990), pp. 3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first years of war, the English took control of the James River, both at its mouth and at the falls. Captain [[Samuel Argall]], in the meantime, pursued contacts with American Indian groups in the northern portion of Powhatan's paramount chiefdom. The [[Patawomeck]]s, who lived on the [[Potomac River]], were not always loyal to Powhatan, and living with them was a young English interpreter named [[Henry Spelman of Jamestown|Henry Spelman]]. In March 1613, Argall learned that Pocahontas was visiting the Patawomeck village of Passapatanzy and living under the protection of the weroance Iopassus (also known as Japazaws).&lt;ref name=&quot;RountreeHelen_a&quot;&gt;Rountree, Helen C.

Retrieved February 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Spelman's help translating, Argall pressured Iopassus to assist in Pocahontas's capture by promising an alliance with the English against the Powhatans.&lt;ref name=&quot;RountreeHelen_a&quot; /&gt; They tricked Pocahontas into boarding Argall's ship and held her for ransom, demanding the release of English prisoners held by her father, along with various stolen weapons and tools.&lt;ref&gt;Argall, Letter to Nicholas Hawes. p. 754; Rountree, Helen C.

Retrieved February 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Powhatan returned the prisoners, but failed to satisfy the colonists with the number of weapons and tools he returned. A long standoff ensued, during which the English kept Pocahontas captive.

During the year-long wait, she was held at [[Henricus]], in modern-day [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]]. Little is known about her life there, although colonist Ralph Hamor wrote that she received &quot;extraordinary courteous usage&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hamor804&quot;&gt;Hamor, ''True Discourse'', p. 804.&lt;/ref&gt; Linwood &quot;Little Bear&quot; Custalow, in a 2007 book, asserted that Pocahontas was raped during this time, citing oral tradition handed down over four centuries. According to Helen Rountree, &quot;Other historians have disputed that such oral tradition survived and instead argue that any mistreatment of Pocahontas would have gone against the interests of the English in their negotiations with Powhatan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, Helen C.

At this time, the minister at Henricus, [[Alexander Whitaker]], taught Pocahontas about [[Christianity]] and helped her to improve her English. Upon her [[baptism]], Pocahontas took the [[Christian name]] &quot;Rebecca&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhr.state.va.us/hiway_markers/marker.cfm?mid=3334 &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, V28], Virginia Highway Historical Markers, accessed 17 Sep 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1614, the standoff built up to a violent confrontation between hundreds of English and Powhatan men on the [[Pamunkey River]]. At Powhatan's capital of Matchcot, the English encountered a group of some senior American Indian leaders (but not Powhatan himself, who was away). The English permitted Pocahontas to talk to her countrymen. Pocahontas reportedly rebuked her father for valuing her &quot;less than old swords, pieces, or axes&quot;, and told the Powhatan she preferred to live with the English.&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Letter to 'D.M.', p. 843â844.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage to John Rolfe===
[[Image:Baptism of Pocahontas.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Gadsby Chapman]], ''The Baptism of Pocahontas'' (1840)]]

During her stay in Henricus, Pocahontas met [[John Rolfe]]. Rolfe's English-born wife and child had died on the journey over to Virginia. He had successfully cultivated a new strain of [[tobacco]] there and spent much of his time there tending to his crop.  He was a pious man who agonized over the potential moral repercussions of marrying a heathen. In a long letter to the governor requesting permission to wed her, he expressed both his love for her and his belief he would be saving her soul claiming he was:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
motivated not by the unbridled desire of carnal affection, but for the good of this plantation, for the honor of our country, for the Glory of God, for my own salvation... namely Pocahontas, to whom my hearty and best thoughts are, and have been a long time so entangled, and enthralled in so intricate a labyrinth that I was even a-wearied to unwind myself thereout&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe. Letter to Thomas Dale. p. 851.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Pocahontas's feelings about Rolfe and the marriage are unknown.

They were married on April 5, 1614, and lived for two years on Rolfe's plantation, [[Varina, Virginia|Varina Farms]], which was located across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] from the new community of [[Henricus]]. They had a child, [[Thomas Rolfe]], born on January 30, 1615.

Their marriage was unsuccessful in winning the English captives back, but it did create a climate of peace between the Jamestown colonists and Powhatan's tribes for several years; in 1615, Ralph Hamor wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since the wedding we have had friendly commerce and trade not only with Powhatan but also with his subjects round about us.&lt;ref&gt;Hamor. ''True Discourse''. p. 809.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Pocanson.jpg|thumb|upright|A photograph of the &quot;Sedgeford Portrait&quot;, said to represent Pocahontas and her son, although its authenticity is debated.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Vera.

The Virginia Company of London had long seen one of its primary goals as the conversion of American Indians to Christianity. With the conversion of Pocahontas and her marriage to an Englishmanâall of which helped bring an end to the [[Anglo-Powhatan Wars|First Anglo-Powhatan War]]âthe company saw an opportunity to promote investment. The company decided to bring Pocahontas to England as a symbol of the tamed New World &quot;savage&quot; and the success of the Jamestown settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''Love and Hate''. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1616, the Rolfes traveled to England, arriving at the port of [[Plymouth]] on June 12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.co.uk/books?id=HHQAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=Pocahontas+plymouth&amp;as_brr=1#PPA90,M1 The Family Magazine - Page 90 (1837)]&lt;/ref&gt; They journeyed to London by coach,  accompanied by a group of about eleven other Powhatans, including a holy man named [[Tomocomo]].&lt;ref&gt;Dale. Letter to Sir Ralph Winwood. p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt; John Smith was living in London at the time and while Pocahontas was in Plymouth, she learned he was still alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, General History, page 261&quot;&gt;Smith, ''General History''. p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith did not meet Pocahontas, but wrote to Queen Anne, the wife of [[James I of England|King James]], urging that Pocahontas be treated with respect as a royal visitor.  He suggested that if she were treated badly, her &quot;present love to us and Christianity might turn to ... scorn and fury&quot;, and England might lose the chance to &quot;rightly have a Kingdom by her means&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Letter to Queen Anne&quot;/&gt;

Pocahontas was entertained at various society gatherings. On January 5, 1617, she and Tomocomo were brought before the king at the [[Banqueting House]] in [[Whitehall Palace]] at a performance of [[Ben Jonson]]'s [[masque]] ''[[The Vision of Delight]]''. According to Smith, King James was so unprepossessing that neither Pocahontas nor Tomocomo realized whom they had met until it was explained to them afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, General History, page 261&quot;/&gt;

Although Pocahontas was not a princess in the context of Powhatan culture, the Virginia Company nevertheless presented her as a princess to the English public. The inscription on a 1616 engraving of Pocahontas, made for the company, reads: &lt;small&gt;&quot;MATOAKA ALS REBECCA FILIA POTENTISS : PRINC : POWHATANI IMP:VIRGINIÃ&quot;&lt;/small&gt;, which means: &quot;Matoaka, alias Rebecca, daughter of the most powerful prince of the Powhatan Empire of Virginia&quot;. Many English at this time recognized Powhatan to be the ruler of an empire, and they presumably accorded to his daughter what they considered appropriate status. Smith's letter to Queen Anne refers to &quot;Powhatan their chief King&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Letter to Queen Anne&quot;/&gt; [[Samuel Purchas]] recalled meeting Pocahontas in London, writing that she impressed those she met because she &quot;carried her selfe as the daughter of a king&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Purchas, Hakluytus Posthumus, Vol 19, p 118&quot;&gt;Purchas, ''Hakluytus Posthumus''. Vol. 19 p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; When he met her again in London, Smith referred to Pocahontas deferentially as a &quot;Kings daughter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, ''Generall Historie'', p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pocahontas was apparently treated well in London. At the masque, her seats were described as &quot;well placed&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Herford and Simpson, eds. ''Ben Jonson'', vol. 10, 568â569&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Purchas, [[John King (bishop)|John King]], [[Bishop of London]], &quot;entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond what I have seen in his greate hospitalitie afforded to other ladies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Purchas, ''Hakluytus Posthumus'', Vol. 19, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all the English were so impressed. According to Helen C. Rountree, &quot;there is no contemporary evidence to suggest&amp;nbsp;... that Pocahontas was regarded [in England] as anything like royalty.&quot; Rather, she was considered to be something of a curiosity and, according to one observer, she was merely &quot;the Virginian woman&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RountreeHelen_b&quot; /&gt;

Pocahontas and Rolfe lived in the suburb of [[Brentford]], [[Middlesex]], for some time, as well as at Rolfe's family home at Heacham Hall, Heacham, [[Norfolk, England|Norfolk]]. In early 1617, Smith met the couple at a social gathering, and later wrote that when Pocahontas saw him, &quot;without any words, she turned about, obscured her face, as not seeming well contented&quot;, and was left alone for two or three hours. Later, they spoke more; Smith's record of what she said to him is fragmentary and enigmatic. She reminded him of the &quot;courtesies she had done&quot;, saying, &quot;you did promise Powhatan what was yours would be his, and he the like to you.&quot; She then discomfited him by calling him &quot;father&quot;, explaining Smith had called Powhatan &quot;father&quot; when a stranger in Virginia, &quot;and by the same reason so must I do you&quot;. Smith did not accept this form of address because, he wrote, Pocahontas outranked him as &quot;a King's daughter&quot;. Pocahontas then, &quot;with a well-set countenance&quot;, said:

{{Bquote|Were you not afraid to come into my father's country and caused fear in him and all his people (but me) and fear you here I should call you 'father'? I tell you then I will, and you shall call me child, and so I will be for ever and ever your countryman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, General History, page 261&quot;/&gt;
}}
Finally, Pocahontas told Smith that she and her fellow American Indians had thought him dead, but her father had told Tomocomo to seek him &quot;because your countrymen will lie much&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith, General History, page 261&quot;/&gt;

==Death==
[[Image:Pocahontas gravesend.jpg|thumb|upright|Pocahontas|Statue of Pocahontas in [[St George's Church, Gravesend|Saint George's church]], [[Gravesend, Kent]], England]]
In March 1617, Rolfe and Pocahontas boarded a ship to return to Virginia; the ship had only gone as far as [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] on the [[River Thames]] when Pocahontas became gravely ill.&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''Love and Hate''. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  She was taken ashore and died in John Rolfe's arms at the age of twenty-two.  It is unknown what caused her death, but theories range from [[smallpox]], [[pneumonia]], or [[tuberculosis]], to her having been poisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Linwood &quot;Little Bear&quot; Custalow and Angela L. Danieal &quot;Silver Star&quot;, ''The True Story of Pocahontas: The Other Side of History''&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Rolfe, she died saying, &quot;all must die, but tis enough that her child liveth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rolfe.

==Descendants==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
Pocahontas and Rolfe had one child, [[Thomas Rolfe]], who was born in 1615 before his parents left for England. Through this son, Pocahontas has many living descendants. Descendants of many [[First Families of Virginia]] trace their roots to Pocahontas and Chief Powhatan, including such notable individuals as [[Edith Bolling Galt Wilson]], wife of [[Woodrow Wilson]]; [[George W. Randolph|George Wythe Randolph]]; Admiral [[Richard Evelyn Byrd|Richard Byrd]]; Virginia Governor [[Harry Flood Byrd]]; fashion-designer and [[socialite]] [[Pauline de Rothschild]]; former First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]]; actor [[Glenn Strange]]; and astronomer and mathematician [[Percival Lowell]].

Her &quot;blood&quot; was introduced to the [[Randolph family of Virginia]] via the marriage of her great-great-granddaughter, Jane Bolling, to [[Richard Randolph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tilton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tilton |first1=Robert S. |authorlink1= |title=Pocahontas: The Evolution of an American Narrative|url=http://books.google.com/?id=idPhpg0PxtAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1994 |month= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521469597, 9780521469593 |oclc= |doi=  |page=191 |pages=|chapter=Notes |chapterurl=http://books.google.com/books?id=idPhpg0PxtAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |ref= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular legend==
[[Image:Pocahontas.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 19th century depiction]]
After her death, increasingly fanciful and romanticized representations of Pocahontas were produced. The only contemporary portrait of Pocahontas is [[Simon van de Passe]]'s [[engraving]] of 1616. In this portrait, he tried to portray her Virginia Indian features.  Later portraits often portrayed her as more European in appearance.

The myths that arose around Pocahontas' story portrayed her as one who demonstrated the potential of Native Americans to be assimilated into European society. For example, the [[United States Capitol]]  displays an 1840 painting by [[John Gadsby Chapman]], ''The Baptism of Pocahontas'', in the Rotunda. A government pamphlet, entitled ''The Picture of the Baptism of Pocahontas'', explained  the characters in the painting, and praised the Jamestown settlers for introducing Christianity to the &quot;heathen savages&quot;.

In another development, Pocahontas' story was romanticized. Some writers preferred accounts of a love story between her and John Smith. The first to publish such a story at length was [[John Davis (writer)|John Davis]] in his ''Travels in the United States of America'' (1803).&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Tilton, ''Pocahontas: The Evolution of an American Narrative'' (Cambridge UP, 1994), pp. 35, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, [[John Brougham]] produced a [[burlesque]], ''[[Po-ca-hon-tas, or The Gentle Savage]]''.

Several [[Pocahontas (disambiguation)#Entertainment|films about Pocahontas]] have been made, beginning with a silent film in 1924. ''[[Captain John Smith and Pocahontas]]'' was released in 1953 with [[Jody Lawrance]] as the titular heroine. In more recent films since the late 20th century, Pocahontas has represented the perceived moral superiority of traditional [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] values over Western ones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s 1995 animated feature ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' presented a fictional love affair between Pocahontas and John Smith. In addition, Pocahontas teaches Smith respect for nature. The sequel, ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]'', depicts her journey to England.

''[[Pocahontas: The Legend]]'' is the second feature film based on her life. [[Terrence Malick]] tried for more historical accuracy in his film ''[[The New World (film)|The New World]]'' (2005), {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} but still portrayed Pocahontas and Smith as lovers.

[[Neil Young]] recorded a song about Pocahontas on his album ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979).
