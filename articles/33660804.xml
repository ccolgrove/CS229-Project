The '''Penn State sex abuse scandal''' refers to allegations that former [[Pennsylvania State University]] [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|football]] assistant coach [[Jerry Sandusky]] sexually assaulted or had inappropriate contact with at least eight underage boys on or near university property.  After an extensive [[grand jury]] investigation, Sandusky was indicted on 40 counts of child molestation dating from 1994 to 2009, though the abuse may date as far back as the 1970s.&lt;ref name=1970s&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/11/exclusive_jerry_sandusky_inter.html |title=Exclusive: Jerry Sandusky interview prompts long-ago victims to contact lawyer |author=Sara Ganim |work=''[[The Patriot-News]]'' |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the scandal, head football coach [[Joe Paterno]] was dismissed from his position and school president [[Graham Spanier]] was forced to resign.

==Background==
Sandusky was an assistant coach under head coach Joe Paterno for the [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State football]] team for 31 seasons from 1969 to 1999.  For the last 23 of those years, he was the team's defensive coordinator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wetzel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wap.yahoo.com/w/sports/home/experts/article?offset=3&amp;urn=urn%3Anewsml%3Asports.yahoo%2Cyhoo%3A20050301%3Ancaaf%2Carticle%2Cdw-wetzel_penn_state_child_sex_case_110511%3A1&amp;.ts=1320564205&amp;.ysid=YrvwsCSswypAL.sUbZLwWEwk&amp;.intl=US&amp;.lang=en

==Grand jury investigation==
The investigation was initiated in the spring of 2008, after the mother of a boy (identified in court papers as &quot;Victim 1&quot;), then a freshman at [[Central Mountain High School]] in [[Clinton County, Pennsylvania]], reported that the boy had been sexually abused by Sandusky. According to court papers, Sandusky had been having a relationship involving &quot;inappropriate touching&quot; with Victim 1 since 2005 or 2006, when the boy was 11 or 12. Sandusky had met the boy through the Second Mile program before retiring from the program in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Key dates&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7212054/key-dates-penn-state-sex-abuse-case |title=Sandusky, Penn State case timeline |work=ESPN.com |date=November 9, 2011 |accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/11/jerry_sandusky_a_penn_state_un.html |title=Jerry Sandusky, a Penn State University football legend and founder of The Second Mile, faces charges of sex crimes |first=Sara |last=Ganim |work=[[The Patriot-News]] |location=[[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] |date=November 4, 2011 |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandusky was also volunteering as an assistant high school football coach at Central at the time of the alleged actions.&lt;ref name=PN01&gt;Ganim, Sara, [http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/03/jerry_sandusky_former_penn_sta.html &quot;Jerry Sandusky, former Penn State football staffer, subject of grand jury investigation&quot;], ''[[Patriot-News]]'', March 31, 2011 8:00/8:20 am.

Pennsylvania Attorney General [[Linda Kelly]] has said that during the grand jury investigation there was an &quot;uncooperative atmosphere&quot; from some of these officials.&lt;ref name=ap1 /&gt;

In December 2010, assistant coach [[Mike McQueary]] appeared before the [[grand jury]] looking into the Victim 1 case.  McQueary testified that, on March 1, 2002, at 9:30 p.m., he entered the locker room at the Lasch Football Building at Penn State and heard what he believed to be the sounds of sexual activity coming from the shower.  He looked in the shower and &quot;saw a naked boy, Victim 2, whose age he estimated to be ten years old, with his hands up against the wall, being subjected to [[anal intercourse]] by a naked Sandusky.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand Jury Report&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Ultimately, the only action taken by Curley and Gary Schultz, Senior vice president for finance and business (who also oversaw the Penn State police department), was to order Sandusky not to bring any children from Second Mile to the football building &amp;mdash; an action that was approved by school president [[Graham Spanier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Key dates&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wetzel/&gt; The identity of the boy remains unknown to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-24008921-when-morality-bows-down-to-sport-and-cash.do|title=When morality bows down to sport and cash|work=London Evening Standard|date=November 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their testimony before the grand jury, Paterno, Curley, and Schultz rejected the version of the incident presented by Mike McQueary. Paterno testified that he was only told about Sandusky &quot;fondling or doing something of a sexual nature&quot; to the victim. Curley and Schultz both denied having been told about alleged anal intercourse. Curley denied that McQueary reported anything of sexual nature whatsoever, and described the conduct as merely &quot;horsing around&quot;. Graham Spanier likewise testified that he was only apprised of an incident involving Jerry Sandusky and a younger child &quot;horsing around in the shower&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand Jury Report&quot;/&gt;

On November 14, 2011, Sandusky's lawyer claimed that he was able to track down Victim 2 and that, according to the child, the incident did not occur as described by McQueary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/15/joe-amendola-lawyer-jerry-sandusky-costas-interview_n_1094163.html|title=Joseph Amendola, Lawyer For Jerry Sandusky, Hints At New Information With Bob Costas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pennsylvania statewide investigating [[grand jury]] identified a total of eight boys singled out for sexual advances or [[sexual assault|assaults]] by Sandusky from 1994 through 2009, after six more victims were identified:&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand Jury Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of Thirty Third Statewide Investigating Grand Jury ('Grand Jury Report')|url=http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/uploadedFiles/Press/Sandusky-Grand-Jury-Presentment.pdf|publisher=Pennsylvania Attorney General|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/636FfNYZ6 |archivedate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/sports/ncaafootball/former-coach-at-penn-state-is-charged-with-abuse.html |title=Former Coach at Penn State Is Charged With Abuse |work=The New York Times |date=5November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Five alleged victims testified that they met Sandusky through The Second Mile; each also stated that they showered with him on the campus.  According to the witnesses, the showers included physical contact ranging from hugs and wrestling to, in one case, Sandusky placing the boy's hand on his erect penis.&lt;ref&gt;Grand Jury Report&lt;/ref&gt;

One child's mother reported the incident to Penn State police when he came home with his hair wet.  After an investigation by Detective Ronald Shreffler, [[Centre County]] District Attorney [[Ray Gricar]] chose not to prosecute. Shreffler testified before the Grand Jury that director of the campus police, Thomas Harmon, told him to drop the case.  University police eavesdropped on conversations during which the mother confronted Sandusky about the incident.  He admitted to showering with other boys and refused to discontinue the practice. District Attorney Gricar was not available to testify, as he had disappeared in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand Jury Report&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/11/mothers_of_two_of_jerry_sandus.html |title=Mothers of two of Jerry Sandusky's alleged victims lash out at Penn State officials' handling of scandal |first=Sara |last=Ganim |work=The Patriot-News |date=November 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victims also commonly reported that Sandusky would place his hand on their thighs or inside the waistband of their underpants.  Two recounted oral sex with Sandusky, sometimes culminating in his ejaculation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand Jury Report&quot;/&gt;  Penn State janitor James Calhoun reportedly observed Sandusky giving oral sex to an unidentified boy in 2000, but Calhoun is in a nursing home suffering from dementia, he was deemed not competent to testify.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand Jury Report&quot;/&gt;

At least 20 of the incidents allegedly took place while Sandusky was still employed by Penn State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/colleges/20111106_Two_Penn_State_officials_charged_in_connection_with_sex-abuse_investigation.html |title=Two Penn State officials charged in connection with sex-abuse investigation |first=Joe |last=Juliano |work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2011, [[Attorney General of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Attorney General]] [[Linda Kelly]] indicted Sandusky on 40 counts of sex crimes against young boys, following a three-year investigation. Sandusky was arrested on November 5 and charged with seven counts of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, as well as eight counts of corruption of minors, eight counts of endangering the welfare of a child, seven counts of [[indecent assault]], and other offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Senior vice president Gary Schultz and Athletic Director Tim Curley were found to be not credible by the grand jury. The two administrators were charged with grand jury perjury and failure to report suspected child abuse by Sandusky. The indictment accused Curley and Schultz of not only failing to tell the police, but falsely telling the grand jury that Mike McQueary never informed them of sexual activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Key dates&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wetzel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Sandusky gave his first interview since being arrested on November 14.

===Ouster of Spanier and Paterno===
[[File:RodneyErickson.png|thumb|right|250px|Penn State's Board of Trustees appointed [[Rodney Erickson]] as interim president on November 9.]]
On November 8, 2011, Spanier canceled Paterno's weekly Tuesday news conference, citing legal concerns.  It was to have been the coach's first public appearance since Sandusky's arrest.  Paterno reported that Spanier canceled the press conference without providing Paterno with an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Penn St. planning Paterno's exit|publisher=Fox Sports|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/Penn-State-planning-Joe-Paterno-exit-amid-sexual-abuse-scandal-110811|date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That same day, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Penn State was planning Paterno's exit at the close of the college football season.  Based on interviews with two individuals briefed on conversations among top university officials, the ''Times'' reported: &quot;The Board of Trustees has yet to determine the precise timing of Mr. Paternoâs exit, but it is clear that (he) will not coach another season.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Penn State Said to Be Planning Paterno Exit Amid Scandal|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 8, 2011|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/sports/ncaafootball/penn-state-said-to-be-planning-paternos-exit.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, the Associated Press reported that Paterno had decided to retire at the end of the 2011 football season, saying that he didn't want to be a distraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AP Source: Paterno to retire at end of season|newspaper=Associated Press|date=November 9, 2011|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FBC_PENN_STATE_ABUSE?SITE=AZPHG&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement announcing his retirement, Paterno said, &quot;It is one of the great sorrows of my life.

An attorney retained by the families of some of the boys who were allegedly abused by Sandusky has criticized the decision by the board to fire Paterno, saying, &quot;The school let the victims down once, and I think they owed it to the victims to at least gauge how the immediate termination decision would impact them as opposed to Mr. Paterno's resignation at the end of the year.&quot;&lt;ref name=dc_lawyercriticizes&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Christina|title=Lawyer criticizes Board of Trustees' decision to fire Joe Paterno|url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2011/11/11/lawyer_criticizes_board_of_trustees_decision_to_fire_joe_paterno.aspx|publisher=The Daily Collegian|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one of the trustees told ''[[The Morning Call]]'' of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]] that he and his colleagues had no choice but to fire Paterno in order to contain the growing outrage over the scandal.  According to the trustee, the board considered letting Paterno stay on for the rest of the year with Bradley as team spokesman, but ultimately decided it would still keep the focus on Paterno.  The board also didn't like that Paterno released statements on his own rather than through the school, with some feeling he may have breached his contract.  The anonymous trustee said that he and many of his colleagues felt Paterno either &quot;knew about [the abuse] and swept it under the rug, or he didn't ask enough questions.&quot;  As for Spanier, the board was very angered by Spanier's statements of support for Curley and Schultz.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Sam; McGill, Andrew.
