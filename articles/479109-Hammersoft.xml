'''Southern Methodist University''' ('''SMU''') is a private university in [[Dallas, Texas]], [[United States]]. Founded in 1911 by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South]], SMU operates campuses in Dallas, [[Plano, Texas|Plano]], and [[Taos, New Mexico]]. SMU is owned by the South Central Jurisdiction of the [[United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scj.umportal.org/ South Central Jurisdiction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 7,000 of the University's 12,000 students are undergraduates.

==History==
The university was chartered on April 17, 1911 by the five [[Annual Conference]]s in Texas of the [[United Methodist Church]]. Classes were originally planned to start in 1913 but were postponed until 1915.

SMU was established as the unsuccessful attempt to relocate [[Southwestern University]] from [[Georgetown, Texas]] to either Fort Worth or Dallas. The first relocation effort by [[Texas Wesleyan University|Polytechnic College]] president [[Hiram A. Boaz]] and spearheaded by Southwestern president [[Robert Stewart Hyer]] involved merging Southwestern with Polytechnic College (now Texas Wesleyan University). The post-merger university would retain the Southwestern name while occupying Polytechnic's campus in Fort Worth.

The merger never came to fruition, primarily because the Dallas Chamber of Commerce set up a committee to raise funds and entice Southwestern to relocate to Dallas. This proposal gained considerable traction since Southwestern was operating a medical school in Dallas. Plans were drawn for the campus's first building, Memorial Hall, which inspired SMU's first building, Dallas Hall. Southwestern's trustees rejected the relocation plan, prompting Hyer's resignation and move to Dallas to establish Southern Methodist University.&lt;ref name=&quot;HyerPapers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00072/00072-P.html|title=Robert S. Hyer papers|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMU retained close connections to Southwestern and Polytechnic. Southwestern president Hyer became SMU's first president. Hiram A. Boaz, a Southwestern graduate, resigned as president of Polytechnic to become SMU's second president. Polytechnic attempted to become a feeder school of SMU before becoming a women's college. SMU acquired Southwestern's medical school in Dallas and operated it until 1915. Southwestern and SMU were athletic rivals until Southwestern became a small liberal arts college.

The effort to establish a new university in Dallas drew the attention of the [[General Conference]] of the Methodist Church, which was seeking to create a new [[Connectionalism|connectional institution]] in the wake of a 1914 [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] decision stripping the church of authority at [[Vanderbilt University]]. The church decided to support the establishment of SMU and dramatically increase the size of [[Emory University]] at a new location in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]]. At the 1914 meeting of the General Conference, SMU was designated the connectional institution for all [[Conferences of the United Methodist Church|Conferences]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00038/smu-00038.html Southern Methodist University origins and history collection] - utexas.edu - Retrieved February 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes were planned to officially begin in 1913, but construction delays on the university's first building prevented classes from starting until 1915. In the interim, the only functioning academic department at SMU was the medical college it had acquired from Southwestern University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/smu/00088/smu-00088.html|title=SMU Medical and Pharmacy School Records|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SMU named its first building Dallas Hall in gratitude for the support of Dallas leaders and local citizens, who had pledged $300,000 to secure the university's location. Dallas Hall remains the university's symbol and centerpiece.  Designed by [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] after the Rotunda at the [[University of Virginia]], Dallas Hall opened its doors in 1915 and housed the entire university as well as a bank and a barbershop. Dallas Hall is registered in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. SMU's nickname &quot;The Hilltop&quot; was inspired by Dallas Hall, which was built on a hill.

The university's first president, Robert Stewart Hyer, selected [[Harvard Crimson (color)|Harvard crimson]] and [[Yale blue]] as the school colors in order to associate SMU with the high standards of ivy league universities. Several streets in [[University Park, Texas|University Park]] were named after prominent universities, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[Purdue University|Purdue]], [[Tulane University|Tulane]], [[Amherst College|Amherst]], [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]], [[Drexel University|Drexel]], [[Hanover College|Hanover]], [[Marquette University|Marquette]], [[Southwestern University|Southwestern]], [[Vassar College|Vassar]], and [[Villanova University|Villanova]].

In 1939, SMU was placed under the South Central Jurisdiction of the Methodist Church.

During [[World War II]], SMU was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;list-of-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html |title=U.S. Naval Administration in World War II |publisher=HyperWar Foundation |last= |first=  |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university drew considerable media attention in 1987 when the [[NCAA]] administered the [[death penalty (NCAA)|death penalty]] against the SMU football program for repeated, flagrant recruiting violations. The punishment included cancellation of the 1987 and most of the 1988 football season and a two-year ban from Bowl Games and all televised sports coverage.&lt;ref name=deathpenalty&gt;[http://people.smu.edu/adedo/deathpenalty.html people.smu.edu - Retrieved February 3, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, SMU was selected, despite considerable controversy, as the site of the [[George W. Bush Presidential Library]] and the George W. Bush Policy Institute.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;/&gt;

SMU has courted Bush&amp;mdash;whose wife, [[Laura Bush|Laura]], is an alumna&amp;mdash;ever since [[Ray Lee Hunt]] broached the subject with the President a few months after Bush assumed office.&lt;ref name=&quot;dallasnews&quot;&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/education/stories/022308dnmetbushlibrary.19ae3faa.html It's official: Bush library coming to SMU] - Dallasnews.com - February 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The museum will be joined by the George W. Bush Institute.

Laura Bush and project architect [[Robert A.M. Stern]] unveiled the center's final design on November 18, 2009, on the SMU campus. Budgeted at $250 million, the {{convert|227000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} complex will include a museum, library, archive and private Policy Institute. The building will be constructed of Texas limestone and red brick with a central landmark tower to blend with SMU's [[Georgian Revival]] architecture, and will look out onto a rolling terrain of native Texas wildflowers and grasses designed by landscape architect [[Michael Van Valkenburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/091123bush_library.asp Robert A.M.

==Athletics==
{{Main|SMU Mustangs}}

SMU's athletics teams are known as the Mustangs and participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], with the [[SMU Mustangs football|football team]] competing as a member of [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]]. With June Jones arrival on the hilltop, the Mustangs have now gone to back to back bowl games &amp; been the C-USA Western Division Champion 2 years in a row. SMU has been a member of [[Conference USA]] (C-USA) since [[2005 NCAA conference realignment|2005]], when it left the [[Western Athletic Conference]]. Before that, the Mustangs participated in the now defunct [[Southwest Conference]].  The football team plays at [[Gerald J. Ford Stadium]] on the SMU campus.

SMU's closest rival in athletics is [[TCU Horned Frogs|Texas Christian University]] (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas.  In football, SMU and [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] compete annually (with the exception of 2006) for the [[Battle for the Iron Skillet|Iron Skillet]].  In 2005, a nationally unranked SMU beat then 24th ranked TCU for SMU's first win against a ranked team in 19 years (since October 1986). 

SMU also competes annually with [[Rice Owls football|Rice University]] in football for the &quot;Mayor's Cup&quot;, a traveling trophy that has been created to enhance the Rice-SMU rivalry, which dates back to 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Doak Walker Award]], an annual collegiate award given to the &quot;most outstanding college running back&quot;, is named after SMU [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Doak Walker]].

The SMU football program has also produced many professional football standouts, such as [[Don Meredith]], [[Doak Walker]], [[Kyle Rote]], [[Eric Dickerson]], [[Jerry Ball]], and [[Craig James (American football player)|Craig James]]. Mustangs recently in the National Football League: cornerback [[Kevin Garrett]] ([[Carolina Panthers]]), defensive back [[Alvin Nnabuife]] ([[Green Bay Packers]]), defensive end [[Justin Rogers]], who was selected in the sixth round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]] by the [[New England Patriots]] and played for the Dallas Cowboys.  Four Mustangs are currently active in the National Football League: wide receiver [[Aldrick Robinson]] ([[Washington Redskins]]), defensive back [[Bryan McCann]] ([[Baltimore Ravens]]), wide receiver [[Emmanuel Sanders]] was drafted in the third round by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in 2010, and kicker [[Thomas Morstead]] was drafted in the fifth round by the [[New Orleans Saints]] in 2009.

From 1980&amp;ndash;1985 SMU had one of the strongest programs in Division I-A (now FBS). They posted a record of 55-14-1, and finished these seasons ranked #21, #7, #2, #19, and #8 in the nation.  These &quot;winningest&quot; years were due to repeated recruiting violations.  These violations are characterized by university coaches and administrators teaming with others in the civic and college football arena to purchase students whose only purpose was to bolster the schools football rankings.  These repeated violations over a period of five years did not go unnoticed by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]].

On February 25, 1987 the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] administered the [[Death penalty (NCAA)|&quot;death penalty&quot;]] for [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|repeated, flagrant recruiting violations]].  Components included cancellation of the entire 1987 season, a two-year ban from bowl appearances, a two-year ban from television appearances, a limit of seven games, all on road, in the 1988 season, a loss of three assistant coaching positions for two years and a loss of 55 new scholarships over four years. Players were allowed to transfer without sitting out one season, per standard requirement.  SMU responded to the combination of these conditions by canceling the 1988 season outright.&lt;ref name=deathpenalty/&gt;

On November 11, 2006, [[redshirt freshman]] quarterback Justin Willis broke the single season touchdown pass record held by Chuck Hixson (21). Willis threw for three touchdowns in a 37-27 loss to the [[Houston Cougars football|University of Houston]], setting the new single season record at 23. At the end of the season, Willis set the new record at 26. He also broke the SMU single season touchdown record accounting for 29 touchdowns. He was named to the Freshman [[All-American]] team at quarterback.

On Monday, January 7, 2008, [[June Jones]] was named the head football coach at SMU. He brought a record of 76-41, all at the [[Hawaii Warriors football|University of Hawai{{okina}}i]], where he won more games than any other coach in school history. He signed a five-year contract worth $10 million. The Mustangs went 1â11 in Jones' first season in [[2008 SMU Mustangs football team|2008]], but dramatically improved in [[2009 SMU Mustangs football team|2009]]. The 2009 team finished the regular season at 7â5, earning the program's first bowl berth since the scandal. The Mustangs defeated [[2009 Nevada Wolf Pack football team|Nevada]] in the [[2009 Hawai'i Bowl|Hawai{{okina}}i Bowl]], which also marked Jones' return to [[Aloha Stadium|the stadium]] where he had coached before coming to SMU.

==Traditions==

'''[[Peruna]]''' - The SMU Mustang mascot came into being when President Hyer's assistant, Dorothy Amann once noted that SMU football players looked like a &quot;bunch of wild mustangs.&quot; The term &quot;Mustangs&quot; became official upon its approval by a student vote. SMU's official mascot was named after an early 20th century patent medicine, Peruna Tonic, which was popular for its highly alcoholic &quot;kick.&quot; Peruna is a black stallion [[Shetland pony]] that attends all home football games. Peruna I was introduced in the 1930s by an early director of the [[Southern Methodist University Mustang Band|Mustang Band]], Cy Barcus. Peruna is accompanied to games by &quot;Peruna Handlers&quot;, students who are trained to lead Peruna across the field after every touchdown.

'''The Boulevard''' - Before every home football game, SMU students, faculty, staff, and alumni gather along Bishop Boulevard (SMU's main street) for pregame picnicking and festivities. The North end of the Boulevard hosts the tents of student organizations, including almost every fraternity and sorority on campus. Other groups such as Student Council, Program Council, and the Student Senate have traditionally participated. Many tents offer free food and drinks. Many fraternities hire bartenders and serve beer to those students and visitors who are 21 and older. The South end of the Boulevard usually hosts the tents of alumni groups and groups from various departments of the school. It is not uncommon to see pets, alumni, and children of all ages with their parents, all walking along the Boulevard. Booths offer face and body painting and give away SMU gear such as pom-poms, stickers, and temporary tattoos. North of the Boulevard, SMU's Main Quad is made available to tailgaters from the opposing team.

'''The &quot;M&quot; Award''' - This awardâgiven to students, faculty, staff, and administrators in recognition of exemplary service to the Universityâis SMU's most highly coveted recognition.

'''&quot;Pony Ears&quot;''' - Mustang fans show school pride by raising two bent fingers, a gesture known as &quot;Pony Ears&quot;, during school songs, chants, and cheers.  In the 1950s, the football team held two fingers up in the air as a sign of unity.  The symbol was meant to represent a 'V' for victory.  By the mid-1970s, the hand symbol became more curved to represent mustang ears &quot;which are kind of floppy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

'''Celebration of Lights''' - This winter tradition is a candlelit ceremony of songs and readings, held each December. The SMU community gathers on the Main Quad of the campus for this popular event. Traditionally, the [[Christmas]] story is read from the [[Bible]] by the University's president. Those who attend sing Christmas carols led by choirs from the Meadows School of the Arts and nearby high schools. The Christmas lights that decorate Dallas Hall and the surrounding trees are lit during this time.

'''Mustang Corral''' - This retreat in the Texas Hill Country is for entering first-year students. Student leaders, alumni, faculty, and staff welcome new students to the SMU community while sharing the rich history of spirit and traditions. Students meet professors, get to know each other, perform skits, and learn the school's cheers. They also compete in various events such as tug-of-war, sponge racing, and water balloon throwing in a camp-wide event known as The Olympics. The team that wins the Olympics receives the coveted Golden Rake.

'''Red and Blue Fridays''' - On the Friday before football games, SMU students wear red or blue shirts to show their support for the team. On game days, students and fans wear red. In the past, the University has sold an &quot;official game day shirt&quot;, which is always red and usually features a clever saying or play on words relating to SMU's mascot, the Mustang.

'''[[Southern Methodist University Mustang Band|The Mustang Band]]''' - The [[Southern Methodist University Mustang Band|SMU marching band]] was the first band to play [[jazz]] music on a [[American football|football field]] beginning in the 1930s. From 1959 forward, the band's instrumentation was designed to mimic that of a [[jazz band]], consisting only of [[brass instruments]], [[drums]], and [[saxophones]].  And, the band began to use actual [[jazz]] arrangements instead of imitation [[jazz]] pieces written specifically for [[marching bands]].  The band has a unique uniform style (coat and tie) which evolves over each season.  The band wears different combinations of uniform parts for the first half of the game, switching or adding parts for the second half, and not repeating any of these combinations for the entire season.  The available parts include: coat (red, or blue), vest (red or blue), button-down shirt (white or blue), pants (white, blue, or khaki), and long tie (red or blue).

'''Peruna''' - Peruna is the official SMU fight song.  It is based on the classic tune &quot;She'll Be Comin' Around The Mountain&quot;.  While officially wordless, the fight song is sometimes sung in parody as &quot;She'll be loaded with Peruna when she comes&quot;.

;Varsity (Alma Mater)

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Oh we see the Varsity, Varsity, Varsity,
As she towers o'er the hill over there.
And our hearts are filled with joy, SMU, SMU,
Alma Mater, we'll be true forever.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Pony Battle Cry

The Pony Battle Cry is SMU's official battle cry.  The lyrics are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Hail to the red and the blue
Weâre the Mustangs from SMU.
Give a cheer, show your might,
Get the victory in sight.
For our battle cry will be:
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
Spirit's the best in the land,
And right to the end weâll stand
For the M-U-S-T-A-N-G-S!
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Mighty Mustang Thunder

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Mighty Mustangs Thunder through the canyon on the hill
For red and blue and SMU Mighty Mustangs always
Will fight! Fight! Fight!
Mighty Mustang Thunder from Peruna's heart within,
Fighting back, fighting on, fighting hard,
Fighting strong,
Mighty Mustangs will win!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
