'''Optimus Prime''' is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Transformers]]'' franchise. Prime is the leader of the [[autobot]]s, a faction of transforming robots from the planet [[Cybertron]]. The autobots are constantly waging war against a rival faction of transforming robots called [[Decepticon]]s. He is depicted as a brave, powerful, wise and compassionate leader who puts his talent to use improving the universe around him. Optimus is portrayed as having a strong sense of justice and righteousness and has dedicated himself to the protection of all life, particularly the inhabitants of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Transformers: Prime on Prime |work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/827/827682p1.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bob Budiansky]], co-writer of the transformers series, [[Dennis O'Neil]] was responsible for his name.

The first generation Optimus Prime transforms into a [[cab over]] truck. Within his chest is a mystic talisman, known as the [[Matrix of Leadership|autobot matrix of leadership]] or the &quot;creation matrix&quot;, carried by all autobot leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1405304618 | pages= 18â19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Optimus transforms, his cab becomes an ion blaster and his trailer disconnects, forming a combat deck. The combat deck supports a mobile battle-station and command headquarters armed with assorted artillery and beam weapons that fire automatically. The combat deck can also serve as a radio antenna for battlefield communications between the autobots. The combat deck also included &quot;Roller&quot;, a mobile scout buggy meant to scout behind enemy lines. When Roller is deployed, Optimus can see and hear what Roller sees and hears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Transformers: The Many Looks of Optimus Prime |work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/996/996813p1.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Injury to one component is felt by each of the others. If the combat deck or Roller were to be destroyed, Prime could survive. However, despite the slight degree of autonomy they possess, the combat deck and Roller would not be able to survive without Optimus.

In the animated series, Optimus is able to fire short-range optic blasts, project holographic maps, and deploy [[hydro-foil]]s, designed by [[Wheeljack]], to traverse bodies of water with ease. In the animated series, Optimus was also given the ability to retract his right hand unit and replace it with a glowing axe.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Across the assorted continuities of the original Transformers universe, there have been various interpretations of Optimus Prime. One of Prime's most notable characteristics over all continuities his unswaying commitment to leadership by example. The animated series' version of Optimus Prime is depicted as a straightforward, wise, and upbeat battlefield [[general]]. Additionally, the animated series' version of Optimus dislikes [[rap music]], putting him at odds with music-loving characters like [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]].

In the [[Marvel Comics]] series, in addition to these characteristics, Prime is secretly plagued by self-doubt and a conflicted sense of [[pacifism]] that often makes him an extremely reluctant [[warrior]]. It is occasionally implied that the conflict with the Decepticons lasts so long primarily because of his unwillingness to take a more aggressive stance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

&lt;!-- the following paragraph seems a bit too detailed, as they only affect very small parts of certain episodes of the show. See WP:FANCRUFT

Prime also enjoys televised sports, most notably [[basketball]] which he even plays (&quot;The Master Builder&quot;), as well as setting up a basketball court outside the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]. Though Prime's personality is like that of a human man age 40-50, he is not above watching afternoon [[soap opera]]s (in the episode &quot;Prime Target&quot;, he is heard groaning out loud when the soap opera he is watching with the other Autobots gets interrupted for a [[news]] report).

=== Marvel Comics ===
''Note: Stories from the U.K. Marvel Transformers series are in italics.''

In the series released by [[Marvel Comics]], before the Great War broke out on Cybertron, the robot who would be Optimus Prime, before he received the [[Matrix of Leadership]] from [[Sentinel Prime]], was a Transformer of note, displaying his skills in the Infraformers Sharpshooting Competition. When the war began, Prime quickly made a name for himself as a combat leader of the Autobots.

On a mission with the [[Triggerbots]] to stop [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] from claiming the [[Underbase]], Prime was forced to jettison the massive databank into space to prevent anyone from acquiring its power. With this action, he proved his wisdom and skill to the Autobot Council of Elders. He continued to move up in rank, eventually becoming the field command over the Autobot armies.

Four million years ago, Cybertron, shaken from its orbit and drifting through space, became threatened when it floated into the path of an asteroid field. Prime led a group of elite Autobot warriors on the Ark, the Autobot starship, on a mission to destroy the asteroids.
Although the mission was successful, during the aftermath of this mission, the Ark was attacked by Decepticons hoping to overpower their weakened foes. Intent on keeping the secrets of the Ark from the Decepticons, Prime set the craft on a suicide course, crashing it into the then prehistoric planet Earth.

In 1984, a [[volcanic eruption]] re-activated the Ark, which, in turn, brought the Transformers back on-line. Prime led the Autobots in their opening battles to prevent the Decepticons from plundering Earth's resources, but, following their initial victory, the Transformers were all deactivated by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. Shockwave killed Prime and leeched the energy of the Creation Matrix leeched from his mind. He used this energy to give life to his creations, the [[Constructicons]]. Shockwave was unaware that the Matrix was not just a program in Prime's mind, but a physical object in his chest. Before Shockwave could give life to [[Jetfire]], his next Decepticon, Prime transferred the Matrix energy into the mind of [[Witwicky family#Buster Witwicky|Buster Witwicky]]. Buster used the energy to turn Jetfire on Shockwave, allowing Prime to reclaim his body and retake leadership of the Autobots. As a reward, he gave Jetfire true life.

Meanwhile, the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] offices of Marvel Comics were producing their own storylines. Writer [[Simon Furman]] offered a different take on Prime, that he was weary of the war he had been forced to fight. In the &quot;Prey&quot; storyline, Prime arranged for [[Wheeljack]] to build a copy of himself and destroy it to see how the Autobots could cope without him. Unfortunately, the plan was derailed by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and the [[Predacons]]. During the battle, Prime, [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], and [[Ultra Magnus]] were transported to Earth. There, Prime accidentally interrupted his own funeral service. The theme of war-weariness would again come to the fore in the U.K. strips detailing Prime's U.S. death.

After a period of effective leadership, which saw the activation of several new Transformers including the [[Aerialbots]], who Prime infused with life using the Matrix, Prime engaged [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] in a [[video game]] duel for possession of a super fuel. Prime was victorious, but [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] implemented a cheat code that killed Prime later. Autobot surgeon [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]]'s subsequent efforts to restore him were unsuccessful, and his body was launched into space. The Autobots were unaware of the presence of the physical Matrix within the corpse. The funeral barge eventually crashed on a giant moon and, as it lay there for an untold time, the Matrix reached out to nearby living organisms, studying and recreating them.

Prime's personality had been copied onto a [[floppy disk]] by [[Ethan Zachary]], the technician running the game. He employed Prime in various video game scenarios he developed. Prime's damaged mind led him to believe that he himself was a video game character and, in an attempt to bring him back to life, [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Goldbug]], [[Joyride (Transformers)|Joyride]], [[Slapdash (Transformers)|Slapdash]], and [[Getaway (Transformers)|Getaway]] took the disk to the planet [[Nebulos]]. They built a new body for Optimus Prime and upgraded it with the ability to combine with the trailer to form a larger robot. In an effort to keep Transformers off their planet, the Nebulans had poisoned their fuel. The sensation of dying, however, convinced Prime that he was truly alive and not a game character. To save his life, the Nebulan scientist Hi-Q [[binary-bonding|bonded]] with him, creating ''[[Powermasters|Powermaster]] Optimus Prime''. A UK story set around the same time in UK #198, Prime returned to Earth and tried to rekindle his feeling for the planet. After a battle between his forces and an advance force from Cybertron ruined a small town's Christmas festivities, he realized that bringing the Transformers to Earth was far worse than anything his troops could have done and vowed to protect its inhabitants from Decepticon aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1405304618 | pages= 58â59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimus Prime's first action as leader was to ally the Autobots with [[Scorponok]]'s Decepticons to defeat [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]], who had acquired the power of the [[Underbase]].

In the U.K. ''Transformers'' stories, Prime and his Autobots later battled a murderous mechanoid named Deathbringer, a creation of the Matrix.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Later, the Transformers were all transported to Cybertron by [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] to battle [[Unicron]]. Although Unicron had tainted the Matrix after killing [[Thunderwing]], Prime managed to successfully reacquire and purify the Matrix. Prime then sacrificed his life one more time to destroy Unicron by plunging the Matrix into his maw. The Powermaster process, however, had been working to fully bond Prime and Hi-Q. Prime's death completed the process, and the two minds and souls became one. Hi-Q's biomechanical body was stripped down and reconstructed by the [[Last Autobot]], resurrecting Optimus Prime once more with the two minds now one. Prime rejoined the other Transformers on the planet Klo and routed [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]]'s Decepticons.

&lt;!-- Is this segment really necessary? It doesn't really contribute to describing Prime himself.

''Prime would appear in the U.K. Marvel comic issue #234, &quot;Prime's Rib!&quot; This story is set in the near future, 1995, where Optimus Prime, [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] and [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]] introduce the latest Autobot, [[Arcee]], to the human [[feminists]]. She was met with displeasure by the humans, being called a token female and disliked for her pink color. They were then attacked by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], [[Fangry]], [[Horri-Bull]] and [[Squeezeplay (Transformers)|Squeezeplay]], who thought the Autobot would be unveiling a new weapon. The Autobots fought off the Decepticons, who escaped, but nothing seemed to please the human feminists.''

--&gt;
The sequel series, ''[[Transformers: Generation 2]]'', began an undisclosed period of time later. At the beginning of the series, Prime was restored to a form resembling his original body. He and the Transformers found themselves caught in the schemes of a new generation of Cybertronians, led by the icy [[Jhiaxus]], who were colonizing and cyber-forming other worlds. Plagued by nightmarish visions of a life-destroying entity called &quot;the [[Swarm (Transformers)|Swarm]]&quot;, Prime looked into Cybertron's past and discovered that Jhiaxus and his kind were the result of an unintentional Transformer reproduction. Their nature and intent, he found, was distilled to the purest, most unemotional form of conquest and that the Swarm was the by-product of this process. To fight this new enemy, Prime and the Autobots entered into an alliance with the recreated [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]'s Decepticons. Though Prime was eventually consumed by the abomination and destroyed, he was able to unleash the energies of the Matrix into the Swarm, purifying it. In parting, the Swarm recreated Prime in a new form, and he and Megatron set out to lead the united Autobots and Decepticons into a new age.

===Animated series===
[[Image:Orionpax.jpg|right|thumb|Orion Pax]]
As seen in the episode &quot;War Dawn&quot;, Optimus Prime began his life as a robot named Orion Pax, a mostly defenseless dock worker during the Golden Age of Cybertron nine million years ago, with a girlfriend named [[List of female Transformers|Ariel]] and a best friend named Dion. During this time, a new breed of robot with new flight capabilities appeared on the planet that Orion idolized. When Megatron, the leader of the new group of robots, approached him with inquiries about using one of the dock warehouses, Orion was swayed by Megatron. Both Orion and Ariel were severely wounded when Megatron and his forces attacked in order to claim the energy stored there. Searching for someone to help them, the time-displaced [[Aerialbots]] took Orion and Ariel to the ancient Autobot, [[Alpha Trion]], who used them as the first subjects for the new reconstruction process he had developed involving rebuilding the frail Autobot frames into more battle-hardy configurations. With this reconstruction, Orion Pax became Optimus Prime, the first of the Autobot warriors.

Optimus took the mantle of leadership as the civil war against the Decepticons erupted, and would remain in that position for the next nine million years. Ariel was rebuilt into [[List of female Transformers|Elita One]], the commander of the Autobot resistance on Cybertron. The fate of Dion is left unrevealed. It has been speculated by fans that Dion might have become Ironhide or Ultra Magnus just as Orion and Ariel became Optimus and Elita, but this remains fan speculation only, and, his close friendship with Optimus notwithstanding, there is no evidence to support the idea. &lt;!--First of all, this sentence clashes with the previous two. Second, it is difficult to understand. Third, &quot;In the TV series&quot; is hardly a reference.
In the G1 TV series, Optimus did mention once upon a time that Dion was rebuilt which known as Ironhide.--&gt;

As leader of the Autobots, Prime headed up their mission to search for new sources of energy to revitalize the depleted Cybertron. Optimus vowed to Elita that he would return from his mission for her, but just before the launch of the Ark, Optimus was mistakenly led to believe that Elita was killed. Shortly after its launch, the Autobots' craft was attacked by the Decepticons' space cruiser, the ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]]'', and boarded by Megatron and the Decepticons. In the ensuing struggle, the G-forces of a nearby planet pulled both craft down, and the Autobots' ship crashed into a volcano, thrusting all the occupants into emergency stasis. Four million years later, in the Earth year 1984 A.D., a volcanic eruption jarred the ship's computer, [[Teletraan I]], back to life. The computer reactivated the Decepticons, programming them with new Earth-based disguise modes. As a parting gesture, Starscream fired upon the Autobot ship, creating a landslide. The vibrations from that landslide knocked Prime into the path of the computer's restoration beam, restoring him to life, thus beginning the war anew on Earth.

Prime was perpetually at the forefront of the action throughout the early years of the war on Earth, usually confronting Megatron, though in some rare instances, such as against the [[Insecticon]]-controlled Decepticons or the [[Combaticons]], teaming up with him for the greater good. He has suffered his fair share of battlefield scrapes, almost meeting his end when his vital cosmotron component was critically damaged by the [[Seekers (Transformers)|Decepticon jets]] and when [[Laserbeak]] had his body disassembled and turned into Decepticon trophies, such as a pet &quot;alligaticon&quot; and a defense laser.

Prime suffered a severe, though unfair, defeat when Megatron challenged him to one-on-one combat while imbued with the different abilities of all the Decepticons. [[Teletraan I]], the Ark's computer, discovered the deception in time, and the Autobots were able to drive off the Decepticons. In &quot;Prime Problem&quot;, Megatron created a clone of Optimus, which caused confusion with the other Autobots. [[Windcharger]] and Spike, however, were able to identify the clone before it led the Autobots into their demise.

In &quot;Prime Target&quot;, [[Lord Cholmondeley]], a big game hunter, set his sights on the ultimate trophy, the head of Optimus Prime. In order to lure Optimus in, Cholmondeley captured [[Tracks (Transformers)|Tracks]], [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Beachcomber (Transformers)|Beachcomber]], [[Grapple (Transformers)|Grapple]], [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]]. [[Windcharger]] and [[Huffer (Transformers)|Huffer]] were able to avoid being trapped. When [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] learned where Cholmondeley was keeping the captured Transformers, Optimus Prime accepted Cholmondeley's challenge to meet him alone. Although interrupted by [[Astrotrain]] and [[Blitzwing]]'s attempt to ally the Decepticons with Cholmondeley, Optimus defeated the big game hunter and freed the Autobots. Cholmondeley and the stolen jet were handed over to the Soviets by the Autobots as punishment for his actions.

Throughout the first two seasons, Optimus Prime has led the Autobots to many victories, such as stopping Megatron from controlling the crystal of power, stopping the [[Dinobots]]' rebellion by saving [[Grimlock]], defeating [[Devastator (Transformers)|Devastator]] with his detach arm, helping capture [[Nightbird (Transformers)|Nightbird]], rescuing [[Blaster (Transformers)|Blaster]] and [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] from the Decepticons on the [[Moon]] with the help of [[Omega Supreme]], and helping save [[Perceptor]] and the other Transformers from the cosmic rust disease.

Over the course of the next twenty years, the Decepticons succeeded in seizing control of all of Cybertron, forcing the Autobots to operate from their new city on Earth and two bases on Cybertron's moons. In the Earth year 2005 A.D., Prime, stationed on Moonbase One, dispatched troops to Earth to acquire energy for an upcoming strike on Cybertron. The Decepticons, however, got wind of the plan and used the shuttle run to attack Autobot City. A distress call summoned Prime and support troops to Earth. In the fearsome ensuing fight with Megatron, Optimus Prime sustained fatal injuries, but not before turning the tide of battle and forcing the Decepticons to flee. Despite the efforts of Perceptor, Optimus Prime went offline. The Matrix and role of leader of the Autobots fell into the hands of [[Ultra Magnus]], [[Galvatron]], and, subsequently, to [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]]. His last words were &quot;Until that day... 'till all are one.&quot;

Prime's body was entombed in a massive deep-space mausoleum with the many other fallen Autobots. In 2006, his grave was desecrated and his body reanimated by [[Quintessons]] in an attempt to destroy the Autobots by using Prime to lure their space fleet into a trap. The Matrix was able to purify Prime of the Quintesson influence, and he ordered the other Autobots to clear out while he piloted his flagship into the Quintessons' detonator, triggering the explosion of a nearby sun. Prime was supposedly destroyed in the explosion. According to &quot;[[The Return of Optimus Prime]]&quot;, Prime's body was recovered from the craft by two human scientists, Jessica Morgan and Gregory Swofford, just minutes before the explosion. As their ship departed, it was coated with solar spores, which induce rage and madness in any sentient being they came into contact with, released by the explosion of the sun. Jessica's father, Mark Morgan, loathed all Transformers, and his hatred only grew when an attempt by the Decepticons to steal a heat-resistant alloy he had developed resulted in Jessica being paralyzed. Swofford and Morgan reconstructed Optimus Prime's body, planning to use it as a delivery system for the spores in order to destroy the Transformers.

When they could not reanimate him, they used his body as a lure instead, bringing the Autobots to their lab, where they are infected. As this &quot;[[Hate Plague]]&quot; began to spread across the galaxy, [[Sky Lynx]] retrieved a Quintesson, who fully restored Optimus Prime to life. Coating himself in Morgan's heat-resistant alloy, Prime reclaimed the Matrix from Rodimus and unleashed its concentrated wisdom to destroy the Hate Plague.

In 2007, following the release of the Matrix's energy, Prime began to suffer from visions which foretold a great transformation for Cybertron. Events began with the Decepticons' theft of the key to the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]], which forced Prime to consult Alpha Trion within [[Vector Sigma]]. Prime learned that the mega-computer had orchestrated events in order to restore Cybertron's Golden Age. When the Plasma Energy Chamber was opened and threatened to drive Earth's Sun supernova, [[Witwicky family#Spike Witwicky|Spike Witwicky]] and the [[Nebulon|Nebulans]], who had become involved in the conflict as a result of these events, were able to drain off the excess solar energy and revitalize Cybertron. With the Decepticons driven off Cybertron and Nebulon free from tyranny, Cybertron enters into a Golden Age of peace and prosperity under the leadership of Optimus Prime and the Autobots.

The seldom seen 5th season re-airing of the show featured the G1 episodes retold by a stop-motion Powermaster Optimus Prime to the live-action youngster Tommy Kennedy. Although no back story was ever provided for how Prime became a Powermaster, the new sequences are said to take place after the four previous seasons. This indicates that Prime became a Powermaster in the original [[Sunbow Productions|Sunbow]] continuity.

Although the animated series ended in the U.S. after ''The Rebirth'', Optimus Prime continued to appear in animated sequences of Transformers toy commercials, progressing from Powermaster to Action Master. He even made an appearance as a computer-generated Combat Hero. Many episodes of the series were re-aired to promote ''Transformers: Generation 2''. During these sequences, computer-generated scenes featuring key G1 characters are borrowed from Generation 2 commercials to serve as opening, closing, and commercial bumpers. Optimus Prime is shown in the opening and closing fighting Generation 2's [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]].

While the ''Transformers'' animated series came to an end in America in 1987 after ''The Rebirth'', production was continued in Japan with three new, exclusive animated series spin-offs to continue the story. The first of these series, ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]'', supplanted the events of ''The Rebirth'', picking up one year after the events that saw Optimus Prime's return to life. &lt;!--Either it does or it doesn't. Which is it?
In the beginning of the series it generally shows Optimus Prime alive again.--&gt;

In the interim year, with the Decepticons defeated, the Autobots entered into an even closer relationship with Earth. The Autobots also began the colonization of other worlds, the first of which was the planet Athenia, where Optimus Prime was stationed. It soon became apparent, however, that the consequences of releasing the energy of the Matrix to cure the Hate Plague were more far-reaching than Optimus had anticipated. Without the energy of the Matrix to act as a balancing factor, Vector Sigma had become destabilized. The Decepticons suddenly returned to exploit this, assaulting Cybertron in order to seize control of the mega-computer. Prime took a squad of troops to aid in the battle on the planet. When the arrival of the Autobot [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmasters]] tipped the battle in their favor, Prime broke off from the main attack and headed down into the depths of the planet, planning on stabilizing Vector Sigma at any cost.

While the other Autobots searched for the Matrix on Earth, Optimus Prime searched for Vector Sigma, guided through the dangers of the planet's catacombs by the spirit of Alpha Trion. Prime eventually arrived at the computer, only to find his way barred by [[Cyclonus]] and [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]]. At that moment, Hot Rod arrived with the Matrix, the same with which Alpha Trion merged, re-energizing it. The Matrix transformed Hot Rod back into Rodimus Prime and, for the first time, the two Primes fought side-by-side and defeated Galvatron.

Before Rodimus could implement the Matrix to stabilize Vector Sigma, however, Optimus Prime merged himself with the computer, restoring its balance to save the planet. Optimus Prime sacrificed himself, dying again only a few short episodes after his rebirth.

Later, Prime would make a final and permanent return in the Japanese Transformers continuity, [[Battlestars: Return of Convoy]]. This entry was only available in print, appearing in the ''TV Magazine'', a Japanese publication.

=== Beast Wars ===
The Beast Wars storyline featured a new character named [[Optimus Primal]]. Though the storyline depicts them as different characters, the commercials and comic which shipped with the original Beast Wars toy versions depicted them as a new incarnation of Optimus Prime in the form of a bat.

[[Optimus Primal]], leader of the Maximal faction in the ''[[Beast Wars]]'' animated series and toy line, is not Optimus Prime. Primal is one of the Maximal descendants of the Autobots, who took the name to honor Optimus Prime. The same applies to the Megatron of this era. Before the animated series began, Hasbro envisioned Prime and Megatron as their beast counterparts, but once the animated series began, this had already been changed. Design elements, such as Prime's mouth-plate slitted to add an actual mouth for the animated series and the first mini-comic that came packaged with the toys, suggest this. Nonetheless, Optimus Prime and Megatron were a major reason the Beast Wars began.

The ''Beast Wars'' were waged on prehistoric Earth, eventually leading to the discovery of the buried ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]''. The beast [[Megatron (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Megatron]], following the original Megatron's instructions in a desperate gambit, attempted to change history by killing Optimus Prime, who was still lying in ''The Ark'' in stasis lock. Megatron hoped that this would result in the Decepticons winning ''The Great War'' and the eventual rule of Cybertron by the Predacons, the descendants of the Decepticons. Megatron unleashed a full-power weapon blast at Optimus Prime's face, delivering a near fatal blow. Optimus Primal, however, took Prime's spark into his body to protect it from surgical trauma while his injuries were repaired. The subsequent power increase caused by Prime's spark's connection to the Matrix augmented Primal into the large, transmetal &quot;[[Optimus Primal|Optimal Optimus]]&quot; form with three alternate modes (jet, land vehicle, and transmetal gorilla). Then, with the repairs complete, Prime's spark was restored, and he briefly activated before sinking back into normal stasis.

When animating the scene in which Primal removes Prime's spark, Mainframe's animators consulted ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' for reference on the interior of Prime's chest. Not realizing the importance of the Matrix of Leadership, they rendered it as a container for Prime's spark. ''Beast Wars'' writers [[Larry DiTillio]] and [[Bob Forward]] have since claimed that in their view, Prime had not received the Matrix from Alpha Trion at this point, but a later comic produced for [[Botcon]] indicated that the Matrix was in fact stored in a secondary compartment, hidden behind Prime's spark. In this particular comic, the alien [[Vok]] used the Matrix, the [[Transmetal Driver]], and a control suit once piloted by the Predacon [[Quickstrike]] to create [[Primal Prime]].

=== Beast Machines ===
A giant statue of Optimus Prime in front of the Cybertron Archives holding two [[Golden Disk]]s appeared on [[Cybertron]] in the ''[[Beast Machines]]'' series, but was destroyed by the [[Vehicon]]s in the episode ''Fires of the Past''. When show writer [[Bob Skir]] was asked what these two disks were he said that neither the statue nor disks were in the script, but he suggested that they were either the disks from [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] probes or that Optimus won them in the 2,395,989th Annual Cybertronian spelling bee.

Later in the series, Optimus Primal discovered the ancient city of [[Iacon]] deep within Cybertron, where he was approached by a hologram statue of Optimus Prime. As it turned out, however, the statue was Megatron in disguise. [[Obsidian (Transformers)|Obsidian]] also comments on how [[Optimus Primal]] is not as great a leader as Prime was.

=== Fun Pblications ===
Based on the ''Classics'' toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story and essentially ignores all events of the Marvel U.K. and ''Generation 2'' comics. [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] survived the crash of the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]] on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form, and now leads [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], [[Skywarp]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] and the [[Constructicons]]. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth, commanding [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], [[Cliffjumper]], [[Grimlock]], [[Jetfire]], [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] and [[Rodimus]], formerly Hot Rod.

In ''Crossing Over'', when the Cybertronians [[Skyfall (Transformers)|Skyfall]] and [[Landquake]] arrive on Earth unexpectedly, Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.

Optimus Prime is among the Autobots present when Megatron attacks [[Iacon]] with his new weapon, Devastator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Pete Sinclair &amp; Jesse Wittenrich | title = Battle Lines Part 5 | journal = Transformers Collectors Club Magazine| volume = 1 | issue = 41 | page= 3 |date = October/November 2011|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convention comics ===
Simon Furman's &quot;Alignment&quot;, a text story available through Transforce, a British Transformers convention, mentions Prime falling during what was intended to be the final conflict with the Decepticons at Pinea Omicron, long after the events of the ''Generation 2'' comic book. He managed to defeat Galvatron II, but in doing so, was damaged such that Grimlock had to engage a stasis field around him to save his flickering Spark, making Prime a living war monument.

Though Prime's ultimate fate is unknown, in a story entitled &quot;The Last Days of Optimus Prime&quot;, also from Transforce, Prime laments the new Transformers age without war and passes on to a Transformers [[afterlife]], referred to as &quot;J'nwan&quot;. The story is vague, however, and may be a metaphor for Prime rejoining the Matrix, as his time had come. In this realm, he was approached by the [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacon]] [[Sandstorm (Transformers)|Sandstorm]], who tried to plead for the help of Prime and the other legendary Transformers in dealing with a [[Unicron]]/Predacon hybrid named Shokaract. Prime refused, but later led a group of Transformers, including Megatron, [[Grimlock]], and [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]), to distract the creature while [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] dealt the final blow.

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
In the 21st century reimagining of the original continuity by [[Dreamwave]] Productions, Optimus Prime started life as a data archivist known as Optronix, or Orion to his friends. After taking note of a battle where the Autobot leader [[Sentinel Prime]] had been killed by Megatron, he was summoned to the Council of Elders and informed that the Matrix had chosen him to be the next leader of the Autobots. He received the Matrix of Leadership shortly thereafter, and arranged for the Autobot evacuation of Cybertron. He intended to leave the Decepticons to their own devices, but a battle with Megatron beneath the planet's surface, accompanied by visions from the Matrix, stirred him on to fight for the safety of his homeworld.&lt;!--Interesting to whom? Is this part strictly necessary?
It is interesting to note that in this reimagining, Optimus actually ''was'' physically changed in appearance and size by the Matrix during the events of the first volume of ''War Within''.--&gt;

Some time into his role as leader, Prime disappeared with Megatron in a spacebridge experiment, spending a period of time on [[Quintessa]], but returned some time later. Events during this period have gone unrecorded as a result of Dreamwave's closure.

The actual events of the Autobots and Decepticon coming to Earth were never printed by Dreamwave comics, but flashbacks of the events are printed later. These flashbacks suggest that the Autobots allied with humankind and defeated the Decepticons at the turn of the century. They planned to return to Cybertron aboard the newly constructed ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark II]]'', but the ship was destroyed as part of a military conspiracy to take control of the transformers. A terrorist organization, run by the enigmatic Lazarus, was able to seize control of several of the Transformers that fell back to Earth while the U.S. military was occupied with locating Prime's body. Before his departure, Prime had entrusted a small portion of the Matrix to [[Witwicky family#Spike Witwicky|Spike Witwicky]], who was forced by the product chief, General Hallo, to use it to reactivate Prime. Functional again, Prime used the Matrix to reactivate more of his fallen comrades, and then faced off against Megatron in [[San Francisco]].

Following the battle, Prime began to experience subconscious urgings, leading both the Autobots and the Decepticons to the Arctic Circle. When they arrived, [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] was there to arrest them as war criminals. Shockwave had succeeded in ending the war on Cybertron, but Prime soon fell in with a rebel Autobot group that had discovered Shockwave had greater agenda. Rallying transformers across Cybertron to the cause, Prime faced Shockwave, but was defeated and had the Matrix ripped from him and used to activate Vector Sigma. Before Shockwave could make full use of the mega-computer's data, however, [[Ultra Magnus]], Prime's brother, arrived and bested him. The injuries Prime took during this conflict necessitated a prolonged restoration period in stasis, but Dreamwave's closure meant that Prime never appeared in their pages again.

Art from unreleased issues later showed Optimus Prime awakening from the cryo regeneration chamber and freeing Alpha Trion from Shockwave's lab.

Prime would make one further surprise appearance in Dreamwave's ''Transformers: Armada'' comic series, although it would not be the Prime of Dreamwave's first series. When [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|the Optimus Prime of the ''Armada'' universe]] disappeared, pulled into another dimension by the power of [[Unicron]], the Chaos-Bringer sent something back in his stead: a nearly dead Optimus Prime from that universe, who warned the transformers of Unicron's coming into their universe before dying.

=== Devil's Due Publishing ===
Optimus Prime would also be a major character in [[Devil's Due Publishing]]'s various G.I. Joe meets the Transformers series. Devil's Due Publishing does not address Prime's early years, save that he survived an assassination attempt by [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] soon after receiving the Matrix. The traditional ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'' storyline left the transformers crashed on Earth. In this series, instead of being reactivated by the Ark, the transformers and the ark were discovered by the terrorist organization called [[Cobra Command|Cobra]]. The transformers inside were reformatted into Cobra vehicles, remotely controlled by the Televipers. Prime was turned into a Cobra Sentry Missile System tank, which was a 1985 [[Sears]] store exclusive red repaint of the HISS tank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yojoe.com/vehicles/85/sms/ Sentry Missile System] - YOJOE.COM&lt;/ref&gt; After an attack on a U.N. summit in Washington D.C., Optimus was able to get a message to [[Wheeljack]], alerting G.I. Joe to where the Cobra base was hidden. Subsequently, he and the other captive Autobots and Decepticons broke free. After the ensuing battle, Optimus fought and defeated his enemy Megatron. After Megatron's defeat, the transformers returned to Cybertron in a second Ark Class vessel, but not before giving their human allies the ability to build and use [[mecha]] based on Transformers technology.

Prime's homecoming was not all he had hoped for, for [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] had taken control of the planet. Prime and the other transformers were forced to go underground, waging a guerrilla war against the Decepticons. Around this time, Cobra would attempt to steal Teletran-3, but their attempt to teleport directly into the chamber would set off a catastrophic malfunction, one that threatened to crack open time itself. Optimus Prime and the [[Stunticon]]s were amongst those who found themselves sent back in time. Optimus was reformatted into a 1920s semi-truck and was eventually rescued by [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]], [[Beach Head (G.I. Joe)|Beach Head]] and the [[Baroness (G.I. Joe)|Baroness]], who helped him capture the Stunticons.

In the wake of this incident, the transformers managed to reclaim much of Cybertron. Mindful of the dangers of allowing humans like Cobra access Cybertronian technology, Prime sent [[Perceptor]], [[Grimlock]], [[Arcee]], and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] on a mission to Earth. As it turned out, Prime's fears were well founded. The U.S. government had used parts from Megatron to create [[Serpentor|Serpent O.R.]], a cyborg designed to be a perfect weapon. A raid by Cobra allowed it to escape and gather an army of Decepticons on Cybertron, killing [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] in the process. Despite the grief of losing Bumblebee, Prime continued on and rallied his comrades to do the same. Attacking the Autobot capital city, Serpentor's forces proved overwhelming, and Prime surrendered to ensure the Decepticons would cease fire and not kill another comrade. Realizing that Serpentor wanted the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership]], Prime broke free as Serpentor was distracted, but was unable to kill him. He was promptly attacked and nearly beaten to death by [[Razorclaw]] and [[Stunticon|Motormaster]]. He was subsequently forced to watch as Serpentor opened the Matrix. In doing so, Serpentor was not only reformatted into a transformer-like mechanoid, but was also shown the futility of the fighting by the Matrix. At this point, [[Cobra Commander]] was able to take control of Serpentor's body. In an attempt to stop him, [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] opened the Matrix and was transformed into a great leader, rendering Cobra Commander comatose. As the Joes prepared to head home, Prime promised to record the Hawk-led humans' future.

Prime appeared again in the fourth crossover called &quot;Black Horizon&quot;. When Hawk, who had been afflicted by the Matrix, began getting dire visions of a new threat, Prime journeyed to Earth. He took Hawk and [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]] to Tibet to discover the source of the problem, only to encounter Bludgeon once again. Prime battled Bludgeon and only won due to intervention by Hawk. Fighting their way into a secret city beneath the [[Himalaya]]s, the trio realized the extent of the threat. At stake was the impending destruction of humanity by [[Unicron]] and the world being taken over by [[Cobra-La]]. Optimus and Hawk were discovered by Bludgeon and a group of Cobra-La troops. Prime defeated Bludgeon,&lt;!-- although the warrior plummeted to his death despite Prime's best efforts.--&gt; then, with Hawk and Joe Colton, gatecrashed the Cobra-La ceremony to sacrifice Firewall to Unicron. Prime was mobbed by Cobra-La warriors and pinned down by a monstrous insectoid creature. Prime demolished them in time to save Hawk from [[Golobulus]]. With Cobra-La arrested by G.I. Joe, Prime made sure his comrades were okay before sitting down to watch TV with [[Eject (Transformers)|Eject]] and Firewall.

In the third series, both Prime and Serpentor indicate that the Matrix had transformed Prime from &quot;''a simple archivist''&quot; into a great warrior. This indicates that the history of this incarnation of Prime is roughly in line with that of the Dreamwave version.

=== IDW Publishing ===
When [[IDW Publishing]] received the rights to the series, author Simon Furman was hired to oversee the line. Furman decided that the Generation 1 continuity &quot;was in need of ... a contemporary restart&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/features/112210635439697.htm |title=Transformers from IDW with Simon Furman: Interviews &amp; Features Archive - Comics Bulletin |publisher=Silverbulletcomicbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that the comic could retain a modern audience. Furman's revised continuity establishes Optimus Prime as the present-day leader of an Autobot army spread across the galaxy in small units, waging a covert war against teams of Decepticon infiltrators over resource-rich worlds. The ''[[The Transformers: Stormbringer|Stormbringer]]'' miniseries explains that the Transformer homeworld of Cybertron is a dead planet, ravaged by an ancient cataclysm caused by the Autobot-Decepticon War. Prime had been forced to ally with his arch-rival Megatron to end the destruction. In the series, the interference of [[Jetfire]] and the [[Technobots]], in a plot organized by the Decepticon [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]], alerts Prime to the possibility that the Cybertronian cataclysm might be re-ignited and spread to other planets. Prime calls in the [[Wreckers (Transformers)|Wreckers]], meeting them on the surface of Cybertron in time to witness the return of the being called [[Thunderwing]], the focal point of the apocalypse. The combined efforts of Prime, the Wreckers, Jetfire, the [[Predacons|Predacon]]-led Decepticons, and a unit of aging Centurion drones are barely enough to render [[Thunderwing]] inert.

Bludgeon's recovered files bring Optimus Prime to Earth, where an Autobot detachment led by [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]] has discovered that a Decepticon infiltration unit led by [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] has broken standard protocol after discovering a new form of Energon. This [[Energon (power source)|Ore-13]] appears to be the same &quot;Ultra-Energon&quot; that Bludgeon used to revive Thunderwing, who had been dormant for millennia after the apocalypse. Starscream had already used it to fuel a failed attempt to usurp Megatron's leadership, as detailed in the ''[[The Transformers: Infiltration|Infiltration]]'' miniseries.

In the ''[[The Transformers: Escalation|Escalation]]'' miniseries, Megatron engages Prime and, boosted by Ore-13, overcomes him. Believing their leader dead, the rest of the Autobots attempt to buy the newly arrived [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]] time to collect the clone. Prime, who had transferred his consciousness to a backup memory in his trailer command post, advised them to exploit Ore-13's weakness and assault Megatron all-out, catalyzing the Decepticon leader's Energon supply and crippling him.

Bumblebee, Jazz, Optimus Prime, Prowl, and Ratchet appeared in a [[New Avengers/Transformers]] crossover by Marvel Comics and IDW Publishing in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0702/28/crossover.htm |title=New Avengers/Transformers |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimus Prime leads Bumblebee, Drift, Kup, Prowl, Ratchet, and Wheeljack in [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] when a Cybertronian ship crashes, containing Galvatron, Cyclonus, Scourge, and an infestation of zombies from another universe. Galvatron attempts to take command of the Autobots and, after fighting them, explains his mission to stop an undead infestation. Wheeljack sets up an energy shield around the city to keep the infestation contained, but it only last for 24 hours. Despite the containment effort, Kup realizes that Bayonet, a Decepticon in Galvatron's command, is not all she seems. She turns out to be the extradimensional vampire Britt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning| penciller = Nick Roche| inker = Joana Lafuente| story = | title = Transformers: Infestation| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = February 2011| publisher = IDW Publishing| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kiss Players===
This Japanese series, told through radio plays using the ''[[Transformers: Alternators]]'' Optimus Prime toy mold, branches off from the original animated series. It is set in a different universe than both the original ''G1'' and ''Binaltech'' continuities. Set in the year 2006, one year after Prime's death in ''The Transformers: The Movie'' and four years before the third season, it sees Prime's corpse covertly transported to Japan by the [[Earth Defense Command]], a government organization. The convoy transporting his body was attacked by a group of female commandos, led by [[Marissa Faireborn]], who had known Prime years ago as a child. Believing they had secured Prime's body, the commandos were taken by surprise by EDC &quot;[[Kiss Players|Kiss Player]]&quot; operative Ringo and her Autrooper mechanoid partner, who killed them all except Marissa. Marissa went to Prime's body just as an Autrooper began to fuse with it and, reflecting on her childhood memories of Prime, she gave his faceplate a final kiss. This initiated a transformation where Marissa and Prime were fused together and Prime was reborn with a new body, capable of transforming into a Dodge Ram SRT-10.

Marissa and Prime are now on the run from the EDC and are also frequently attacked by the mysterious &quot;Legion&quot; Transformers. When faced with such foes, Marissa unleashes her &quot;Kiss Player&quot; ability by kissing Prime, fusing with him once again, increasing his power so that he can best their opponents. Prime is armed with the Surf Blade, a weapon formed out of Marissa's surfboard, wielded expertly thanks to the knife skills Marissa passes on to him when they merge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toyvey.com/kisskiss |title=Transformers: KissKiss, a Transformers KissPlay information site |publisher=Toyvey.com |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Binaltech===
Due to the interference of Ravage, the same as the one who appears in the [[Beast Wars]], most of the events of the [[The Transformers: The Movie|original animated feature]] do not transpire. The most influential of these events is the Battle of Autobot City. Because this battle did not occur, Optimus Prime and Megatron do not have their final showdown. This means that, for this continuity, Optimus Prime does not die and Megatron is never reformatted into Galvatron. As a result, Optimus Prime is able to lead the Autobots during the Binaltech saga.

Equipped with knowledge of the future and the danger that would soon be threatening the transformers, Ravage's machinations included trapping Megatron and a large army of Decepticons in a spacial rift with the intention of protecting the Decepticons from the approaching [[Unicron]] and forcing the Autobots to face the planet-eater unaided. The Decepticons would then be in a position to conquer the victor of that battle.

Aware of the changes to the timestream and the potential for the entire Autobot race to be annihilated by Unicron, Optimus put into motion Operation Distant Thunder, a plan to undo the damage to the timeline caused by Ravage, restoring the events that were seen in the movie. This would mean that saving all the Autobots from Unicron would result in Prime and others such as Prowl, Wheeljack, Ironhide, and Ratchet would die per the original events. They hoped they would be able to at least partially avoid such an outcome by sending a message to their past selves about all they had learned.

Upon discovering that the Matrix was the key to destroying Unicron, Optimus Prime and [[Ultra Magnus]] went alone to face Unicron while the rest of the Autobots executed the plan to restore the original timeline. They hoped that at least one of these plans would be successful. Prime was injured in the confrontation with Unicron and, although his injuries were not mortal, he passed the Matrix to Magnus, who shed his outer armor and managed to successfully complete the mission, destroying Unicron.

Distant Thunder was ultimately unsuccessful, but as the universe started to rip apart, a black Optimus Prime clone appeared. The Binaltech universe was split into its own separate continuity, while the original timeline was also restored, stabilizing the multiverse. The clone, friendly to the transformers, proclaimed that the Binaltech universe must be allowed to continue, as it was important to the future. Optimus Prime questioned the black doppelganger, who explained only that he carried &quot;the Protector's&quot; spark, but refused to reveal any more detailed information. Soon after, the clone, who was originally developed by Dr. Archeville as a weapon of evil, ejected the spark that had invaded and taken over the black figure, reverting to its original evil programming. The malevolent Nemesis Prime, no longer just a black version of Optimus, escaped.

Per Ravage's original plan, with Unicron defeated, the Decepticons returned to conquer the transformers. Optimus Prime had also planned for this event, and sent Mirage to press a switch, buried deep within Cybertron, that would render all transformers inert. This was seen at the conclusion of the &quot;Five Faces of Darkness&quot; story arc from the original animated series. Optimus hoped that by rendering all the transformers inoperative, the war would be stopped, hoping that the humans would be able to reactivate the transformers in the future. Instead of deactivating all transformers, however, only those with original Cybertronian bodies were deactivated. Transformers with Earth-made Binaltech bodies continued to function. The Autobots effectively won the war, the large army of Binaltech Autobots easily outnumbering the few Decepticons who had managed to procure Binaltech upgrades. The few Decepticons remaining, effectively just Nemesis Prime and Shockwave, escaped with Megatron and their other inert comrades.

With the major threats taken care of, Optimus Prime turned his and the Autobots' attention to identifying and shutting down the rogue projects taking place across Earth using stolen Binaltech technology and secrets. It was during one of these missions that Optimus Prime faced off against Nemesis Prime, both in Binaltech [[Dodge Ram]] forms. Initially, things looked bad for Optimus Prime, as he was no match for his opponent's spectral armor. However, the Protector merged with Prime, and the enormous power that resulted allowed Prime to reflect Nemesis Prime's final attack, obliterating the evil Decepticon. Optimus Prime recalls the union of the two sparks being familiar, from an event in the distant past. Optimus Prime is reassured by the Protector about &quot;the seeds of the future&quot; and the Protector is revealed to be [[Optimus Primal]].

=== Toys ===
[[image:Optimus Prime patent.png|right|thumb|The original Optimus Prime toy patent design. Art by Hiroyuki Obara.]]

Through the years, there have been many action figures made in the likeness the original incarnation of Optimus Prime, some of which have been featured in fiction, others of which have not. Additionally, some toy makers have made unlicensed toys in his image or accessories for the existing toys.

The original 1984 Optimus Prime toy was part of [[Takara]]'s 1983 [[Diaclone]] toy line named &quot;Battle Convoy&quot;. It was designed by the creative design team of Hiroyuki Obara, [[Shoji Kawamori]], famous for his work in ''[[Macross]]'', and [[Kohjin Ohno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Igarashi|first= Kouji|authorlink= Kouji Ogarashi|title= ã¿ã«ã©SFã©ã³ãå¤§å¨é|publisher= Kodansha|date= 1999.11|location= Tokyo|isbn= 4-06-330086-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toy's characteristics, such as the head design and the use of the cab front as the upper torso, have become design elements in nearly every incarnation and variant of Optimus Prime. This particular toy has been reissued multiple times, mostly to commemorate the anniversary of the transformers franchise. Optimus Prime was also released as an [[Action Master]] and [[Powermaster]] toy in the original transformers toy line.

For the ''Generation 2'' toy line, the original Optimus Prime toy was altered somewhat and an electronic sound maker was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mbTUorcuXkoC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=%22generation+2%22+transformers&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=woyoTPq8KI7hnQeIwOWjDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22generation%202%22%20transformers&amp;f=false |title=The African American entrepreneur: then and now By W. Sherman Rogers page 321 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later ''Generation 2'' toys of Optimus were completely new designs, such as Combat Hero Optimus Prime, Laser Optimus Prime, and [[Gobot]] Optimus Prime, who could become a red [[Lamborgini]] car.

In 2003, Takara introduced the [[Transformers: Masterpiece|Masterpiece]] MP-01 Convoy/Optimus Prime. While retaining the original concept of a transforming semi-trailer truck, this [[Die-cast toy|die-cast figure]] incorporated modern toy manufacturing techniques for improved detail and articulation, while, at the same time, captured the look of the cartoon character. It has since been released by both [[Hasbro]] and [[Takara Tomy]] in different variations.

In 2006, Hasbro introduced ''Alternators'' Optimus Prime, which turned into a licensed 1:24 scale model Dodge Ram SRT-10.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The Future| last=Brereton | first=Erin | year=2006 | publisher=Triumph Books| ISBN=1572439831 | page= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a version of the Masterpiece toy, called Masterpiece Convoy Sleep Mode, was released, painted in dark colors to match the appearance of Optimus Prime after his death in the 1986 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Masterpiece Convoy Sleep Mode| magazine=Lee's Toy Review| issue=213| year=2010| page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, as part of the merchandising wave for the first transformers film, Hasbro's [[Playskool]] line released a Transformers-themed version of [[Mr. Potato Head]] based on Optimus Prime.  To keep with the potato theme, the toy was labeled &quot;[[Optimash Prime]]&quot; and the packaging included the slogan &quot;More than meets the fry&quot;, a potato-oriented version of the Transformers slogan &quot;More than meets the eye&quot;.

===Other merchandise===
Optimus Prime is among the three Autobot figures available to play in the [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] Transformers Collectors Edition game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.80stees.com/products/Transformers-Monopoly.asp |title=Collectors Edition Transformers Monopoly |publisher=80stees.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the figurehead of the entire Transformers franchise, Optimus Prime has been on more pieces of merchandise than can be stated here. Several statues and busts of Optimus Prime as well as Optimus Prime themed objects have been released by various companies since the return of transformers to prominence, such as the &quot;Optimus Prime Oral Care Station&quot;. Other figures released include various PVCs as part of Takara's &quot;Super Collection Figure&quot; line, which were later imported as part of Hasbro's &quot;[[Heroes of Cybertron]]&quot; series. Larger &quot;Mega Collection Figure&quot; PVCs were articulated and came with energy axe and gun figures.

===Video games===
Optimus Prime has appeared in numerous video games since the introduction of the ''Transformers'' series. He makes a cameo in the 1999 ''Beast Wars Transmetals'' video game for Nintendo 64, where he is killed by [[Megatron (Beast Era)|Megatron]] at the end of the campaign, showing what would have happened in the ''Beast Wars'' series with a [[Predacon]] victory. Prime is also one of the playable characters in the 2003 Japan-only ''[[Transformers (2003 video game)|Transformers]]'' game for the [[PlayStation 2]] and the 2010 ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]''. Optimus Prime is also playable in the Hasbro [[Net Jet]] ''Transformers'' fighting game ''Transformers Battle Universe''. Three versions of Optimus Prime are playable characters, including the first generation incarnation, his incarnations from the [[Transformers (film)|2007 live-action film]], and the incarnation from ''[[Transformers Animated]]''. In this game, [[Optimus Primal]] is also a playable character. He is a regular character in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and PlayStation 2  2003 [[fighting game]] ''[[DreamMix TV World Fighters]]''. He appeared as a [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] in a simple [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based video game on the Hasbro web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hasbro.com/monkeybartv/default.cfm?page=Entertainment/OnlineGames/GameSelect&amp;game=1787 |title=Entertainment/OnlineGames/GameSelect/Action Games/Transformers/Transformers Battle Circuit |publisher=Hasbro |date= |accessdate=2010-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation version of Prime is also offered as downloadable content for some versions of the 2009 third-person shooter ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (video game)|Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.

Optimus Prime is the fictional protagonist of the ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'' (''Fire Convoy'' in the original Japanese version) branch of the [[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=TRANSFORMERS ROBOTS IN DISGUISE Returns!

His voice actor, [[Neil Kaplan]], does his voice in a style reminiscent of that of [[Peter Cullen]], the voice of the original Optimus Prime. Wired Magazine nominated Fire Convoy as one 12 most ridiculous Transformers ideas of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Less Than Meets the Eye: The 12 Most Ridiculous Transformers of All Time|work= [[Wired Magazine]]|date=|url= http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/08/less-than-meets/|accessdate=2010-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hidden on Earth as common, everyday vehicles, the Autobots are forced to emerge when [[Megatron (Robots in Disguise)|Megatron]] and his [[Predacon (Transformers)|Predacons]] arrive and wreak havoc in their attempts to attain the power of Earth's various energy sources.

In this universe, Optimus Prime transforms into a fire engine. The front section of the vehicle detaches and becomes Prime himself, armed with &quot;Blaze Blaster&quot; cannons. To attack, he is able to use his headlights, known as the &quot;Fire Flash&quot; attack, and leg wheels, known as the &quot;Gyro-Strike&quot;. The rest of the vehicle transforms into a mobile battle station/refueling port/communications array and can combine with Prime as additional weapons and armor, forming his super mode referred to as &quot;Super Fire Convoy&quot;. The ladder/hose section houses Prime's Power Stream water cannon, capable of shooting freezing streams of water, called his ''Blizzard Storm'' attack. It also contains a quartet of rocket launchers. In super mode, his feet contain missile launchers than can mount to the shoulders of his regular robot mode. In this mode, he can fire his fists for his &quot;Flying Fist&quot; attack.

===Animated series===
Optimus Prime and his brother, [[Ultra Magnus (other incarnations)#Transformers: Robots in Disguise|Ultra Magnus]], were created at the same time by [[Alpha Trion]], but when Prime was chosen to carry the Matrix, Magnus felt ignored, and was left carrying a grudge against his brother.

Later, Optimus pursued Megatron to Earth to stop him from pillaging the planet's energy resources. Prime's loyal team of Autobots clashed with Megatron's Predacons on many occasions, stopping their schemes with the aid of Koji, a human whose father had been abducted by the Predacons. Prime and Koji went on to form a strong friendship, although Prime blamed himself for Koji's father's abduction. Optimus proved his bravery on many occasions, battling and defeating [[Sky-Byte]] in an underwater duel and personally rescuing [[Side Burn]] from a Predacon trap. Later, when Megatron targeted a tanker truck to scan as the alternate mode of the final protoform, Optimus Prime leapt into action in order to save the truck's human driver and, as a result, the tanker, Prime and the human were all scanned. With an infusion of Megatron's spark energy to complete the concoction, [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] was born, emerging from his pod as a dark twin of Optimus Prime. Prime's pleas to make Scourge remember his original Autobot loyalties fell on deaf ears.

Prime soon had other things to worry about, as Magnus arrived on Earth with the intention of taking the Matrix, which he believed was rightfully his, at all costs. Prime, who refused to fight back, was seriously injured by Magnus. Magnus tracked Optimus to a desert island, where he pretended to offer him the hand of friendship, only to attempt to absorb the Matrix for himself. During the struggle, the brothers combined into the form of [[Omega Prime]], also known as the God Fire Convoy. Through this link, Magnus was also able to channel the power of the Matrix, which he used to supercharge the [[List of Transformers: Robots in Disguise characters#Autobots Brothers (3 Autobot Brothers)|Autobot Brothers]] into newly colored forms. Prime went on to battle the Decepticons on many other occasions. Although Magnus remained a free agent, refusing to take orders from his brother, over time, his animosity dwindled, and he frequently helped the Autobots by combining with Prime to battle the Predacons and Decepticons. During the final battle with Megatron's new form, [[Galvatron#Transformers: Robots in Disguise|Galvatron]], the two brothers finally reconciled. Together, they faced Galvatron at the Earth's core and successfully defeated him once and for all.

In ''Car Robots'', the original Japanese version of ''Robots in Disguise'', there is not one singular Matrix, but multiple ones, each held by a high-ranking Autobot. God Magnus already possesses a Matrix, and simply seeks to steal the power of Fire Convoy's to increase his own. The overspill supercharges the Autobot Brothers.

===Dreamwave Productions===
An incarnation Optimus Prime made one appearance in [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]]'s Summer Special issue before the company went under. Optimus Prime and Magnus had to work together to stop the Decepticons from stealing a nuclear reactor. Shortly after, it was decided that ''[[Beast Wars]]'', rather than ''Robots in Disguise'' (RiD), would be the next Dreamwave comic series.

Prime would make one further surprise appearance in Dreamwave's Transformers: Armada series. With [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]] having disappeared to an alternate dimension, devastated by [[Unicron]], the Autobots attempted to find their leader. As [[Jetfire]] attempted to locate him through Spacebridge links to other dimensions, one of these clearly shows RiD Optimus Prime and [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]].

===3H Enterprises===
In 2002, 3H secured the official Transformers convention license as well as licenses to produce comic books and start a fan club. Optimus Prime appeared in Transformers Collectors Club comics, a comic released by 3H enterprises. In the comic, he is the same Optimus Prime from the ''Robots in Disguise'' continuity, but is taken to the ''Transformers: Universe'' reality.

This incarnation of Optimus Prime first appeared in the ''Transformers: Universe'' comic series in issue #2. As part of Omega Prime, he was escaping with various other Transformers from Unicron. He appeared again at the end of issue #3, brought in to [[Alpha Trion]]'s lab to aid [[Optimus Primal]]. After this, both Prime and Magnus became part of Optimus Primal's army of Autobots, battling against Unicron's Decepticons.

According to the bio printed in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine, Optimus Prime was a member of the Cybertron Dimensional Patrol, but was abducted by [[Unicron]]. It is unknown whether he repainted himself yellow before being abducted or if the recoloration was due to the radiation emanating from Unicron, which has a tendency to recolor Cybertronians.

The conclusion to the storyline was forestalled when Hasbro retracted 3H Enterprise's license, but an explanation can be found in issue 8 of the Transformers Collectors Club magazine, ''Cybertron/Robots in Disguise''. In this issue, Prime tells the tale of how Unicron's forces were defeated in the last battle by Optimus Primal's forces and Unicron disappeared into the black hole opened in ''[[Transformers: Energon]]''. Combined as Omega Prime, they could not escape fast enough, and were sucked into another dimension.

===Fun Publications===
In the ''Cybertron'' universe, Cybertron was under attack by two of the [[Heralds of Unicron]], [[Nemesis Prime]] and [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]]. They had already damaged [[Alpha Trion]], and while Ramjet engaged [[Vector Prime (Transformers)|Vector Prime]] in a duel high above Cybertron, Nemesis Prime got past [[Sentinel Maximus]] and revealed his plan to use the Dead Matrix to drain [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]] and use the energy to revive Unicron. Omega Prime, a combination of Optimus Prime and his brother, Ultra Magnus, appeared to challenge Nemesis Prime. The brothers recovered, only to receive Optimus Prime, bearing word of Vector Prime's death in battle. Prime and Magnus were subsequently seen planning the hunt for Unicron with Sentinel Maximus.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDW Publishing&quot;&gt;{{Cite comic| writer =[[Forest Lee]] and [[Dan Khanna]] | penciller =[[Forest Lee]] | inker = | story = | title = [[Transformers: Cybertron: Balancing Act]]| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = April 2007| publisher = IDW Publishing| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of Optimus Prime was created for the Transformers: Universe storyline. This version of Optimus Prime comes from a universe populated solely by [[Spy Changers]] where transformers are smaller than those in other universes.

===3H Enterprises===
This version of Optimus Prime appeared in the 2004 BotCon voice actor play, and was seemingly another Optimus Prime brought from a parallel dimension to that of the ''Robots in Disguise'' fiction.

The voice actor drama was written for [[OFTCC]] 2004 by Simon Furman, set after the events in the comics. Among those taken from their world via teleportation beam by Unicron and his Decepticon minions were Spy Changers Optimus Prime, Prowl, Ultra Magnus, and Ironhide. The Autobot forces opposing Unicron attempted to deflect a beam, leaving them all trapped on an uninhabited ice-world. The Autobot forces teamed up to overcome the Decepticons led by [[Reptilion]]. The Autobots were then, presumably, returned to their own worlds.

The &quot;[[Unicron Trilogy]]&quot; version of '''Optimus Prime''' is a fictional character of this branch of [[Transformers (fiction)|Transformers lore]]. Appearing in ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'', ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' (known as the aforementioned trilogy), Optimus is the leader of the heroic Autobots. He often converted to his super combat mode. In all three series, Optimus' English voice actor is [[Gary Chalk (actor)|Gary Chalk]], who previously voiced [[Optimus Primal]] in ''[[Beast Wars]]'' and ''[[Beast Machines]]''.

===Animated series===

In ''[[Transformers: Armada]]'', Optimus Prime shares the role of main protagonist with Rad, Alexis, Carlos, Red Alert and Hot Shot. The Optimus of this universe shares many similarities with his parallel universe versions, including nobility of spirit and a strong desire to protect all humans on Earth. In this continuity, the two sides are not looking for energon, but a small race of power-enhancing transformers known as [[Mini-Cons]]. Optimus led his small band of Autobots to stop [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] from acquiring their power for himself.

In his first appearance in the series, Optimus looks similar to the original [[Transformers: Generation One|G1]] Optimus Prime until he copies himself with a semi-truck and his design in robot mode changes to the image shown here. Soon after, he retrieves his Mini-Con partner, [[Sparkplug (Transformers)|Sparkplug]]. The cab of his truck mode detaches to form Optimus himself, while the trailer transforms into a battle station mode operable by Optimus and several Mini-Cons. Optimus can also combine with his base to form a &quot;Super Mode&quot; robot that, when combined with Sparkplug, can fire a series of powerful lasers. Additionally, Optimus can combine with [[Jetfire]] and/or [[Overload (Transformers)|Overload]] in his Super Mode for additional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper| title=That's not all folks; CARTOON CLASSICS: 1970s CULT HEROES RETURN| newspaper=Evening Times| date=2003-04-18| first=Jonathan| last=Rennie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After many battles on Earth, Optimus died by standing purposefully in the path of the [[Hydra-Cannon]] built by Megatron from the three Mini-Con weapons, the [[Star Saber]], the [[Skyboom Shield]], and the [[Requiem Blaster]]. He managed to partially reflect the beam, damaging the Hydra-Cannon. It was the Mini-Cons themselves, however, who resurrected him, entering the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership|Matrix]] and reconstructing a new body for him. Subsequently, [[Unicron]] forced Optimus to face the dark part of his soul and that, on some level, he enjoyed the thrill of combat. Following Unicron's defeat, Optimus's denial was sorely tested as [[Galvatron]], an upgraded Megatron, forced him into one final furious battle. The battle ended when Starscream sacrificed himself to end the circle of hate that powered Unicron. Floating through space, Optimus found the Matrix, but said he did not deserve it. Before beginning the battle with Galvatron, he was upgraded by the minicons. His red torso turned black and he was able to battle Galvatron one on one.

He next appears in ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', the only time during the Unicorn Trilogy where Prime is not the main protagonist. In ''Energon'', set ten years after ''Armada'', he is no longer able to combine with his trailer. Instead, he has been gifted with the Spark of Combination by [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], allowing him to combine with the quartet of vehicular drones in his trailer. Fire One, Copter Two, Digger Three, and Submarine Four, can each form either an arm or a leg when they combine with Prime, creating his super mode. Later, Prime gained the ability to combine with fellow Autobots [[Wing Saber]] and [[Omega Supreme]], the latter case creating '''Optimus Supreme'''.

Although peacetime in the decade that followed the apparent deaths of Unicron and Galvatron afforded Prime the opportunity to train his own elite squadron of Autobots the martial art of Kumite. The re-emergence of the war, however, forced him to return to his role as commander. The conflict for control of the Mini-Cons and the truths he was forced to face in his confrontation with Unicron seems to have changed him. Optimus Prime, ''Grand Convoy''' in the Japanese version, was now a stern, more direct commander and shows little of the conflict that held him back before. Despite this, he is still known to make the same kind of decisions, which include an emphasis on team work and the foundation of the Autobot values.

In order to defeat a Unicron-possessed Galvatron, Optimus Prime formed '''Shining Optimus Supreme''' when he combined with all other Autobots.

In a later battle, Optimus Prime duplicated the form of Optimus Supreme without actually combining with Omega. To make this form, his Prime Force drones combined with him,\ without the intervention of Omega Supreme.

Although the original Japanese incarnation of ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'', known as ''Transformers: Galaxy Force'', was produced apart from ''Armada'' and ''Energon'', the series, as originally conceived by [[Hasbro]], was as the third part of the trilogy. The English language dub of the series treats it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = | title = Transformers - Galaxy Force Secret Special DVD!| journal = TV Magazine| volume = | issue = | pages= |month = February| year = 2006 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvsjngLBR54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, inconsistencies arise between ''Cybertron'' and the other two series, but have been explained by the ''Cybertron'' comic book, available exclusively through the Official Transformers Collectors Club, as the result of fluctuations in the fabric of reality caused by the Unicron-induced [[black hole]].

In this incarnation, Optimus Prime is the main protagonist and shows a near-[[xenophobic]] reluctance with interacting with other cultures, believing that such interaction would cause more harm than good. Consequently, he prohibits his team from mingling with the locals of [[Earth]], [[Velocitron]], and the [[Jungle Planet]] during their search for the [[Cyber Planet Keys]]. This attitude was drastically changed when Prime realized that the only way to acquire the Cyber Planet Keys from Velocitron and Animatros was to play by their laws.

Early in this new series of encounters with Megatron, Red Alert contacted the Autobots on Earth and asked for Optimus Prime to join then on Velocitron. [[Ransack]] and [[Crumplezone]] tricked [[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] and Dirt Boss into believing that a race between them would determine which of them would be allowed to race Override for the Planet Cup. During the race, Ransack and Crumplezone caused a rockslide that buried Hot Shot. Hot shot was saved when Optimus Prime, Vector Prime, and Landmine arrived, but Optimus was upset that Hot Shot had become involved with the locals. Clocker and Brakedown were eager to help the Autobots. After being unable to obtain the Planet Cup from Override herself, Optimus Prime endorsed Hot Shot's plan to win the cup in a race with the aide of the other Autobots. Ransack and Crumplezone were contacted by Megatron and were told to keep on eye on things. They also decided to enter the race, either to win the cup and cause as much damage as they could to the other racers. Override, Dirt Boss, Ransack, Crumplezone, Optimus Prime, Hot Shot, Red Alert, Landmine, Clocker and Brakedown participated in the qualification round.

During the Animatros story arc, it was discovered he could combine with [[Leobreaker]] to form Savage Claw Mode, a stronger form. This mode allowed him to defeat Scourge.

In addition, Optimus can combine with [[Wing Saber]] to form Sonic Wing Mode, Sonic Convoy in Japan. This mode helps Optimus defeat Starscream.

On a few occasions, during and after the Autobots go to Gigantron, Optimus Prime wields [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]'s giant axe-like weapon, Sparkdrinker, despite the fact that it is much larger than he is. He used it to defeat Galvatron on several occasions.

Near the end of the series, in what is generally regarded by fans to be his most impressive feat, Optimus Prime takes on Galvatron without combining with any other transformer. Traditionally, throughout the three series and ''RiD'', Optimus Prime has been shown to be physically weaker than Galvatron. At the end of the intense fight, Galvatron proved stronger than Prime, but Prime managed to destroy Galvatron with [[Vector Prime (Transformers)|Vector Prime]]'s sword.

In the final episode of ''Transformers: Cybertron'', Optimus Prime proposed a new Space Bridge project using the power of the four Cyber Planet Keys and the four great Cybertronian ships. Many Autobots and former Decepticons joined in the project. Jetfire was left in charge of Cybertron as Optimus Prime led the Atlantis with the Earth Cyber Planet Key, joined by Red Alert, Safeguard, Scattorshot, Leobreaker, Menasor, and Heavy Load.
&lt;!--Override led the Ogygia and Velocitron Cyber Planet Key with Brakedown, Quickmix, and Stripmine. Evac led the Hyperborea and Jungle Planet Cyber Planet Key with Backstop and Lugnutz. Metroplex led the Lemuria and Gigantion Cyber Planet Key with Drillbit, Undermine, and Brimstone.

This section doesn't really have anything to do with Optimus Prime, only the transformers series as a whole. Therefore, it should be excluded.--&gt;

===Dreamwave Productions===
Just as [[Marvel Comics]] produced a companion comic to the original Transformers toyline that differed from its animated counterpart, so did Dreamwave produce a [[Transformers: Armada (comics)|comic]] to go along with the ''Transformers: Armada'' and ''Energon'' lines that owed little to their animated fellows. This incarnation of Optimus Prime, however, is not particularly different from his animated counterpart in personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper| title='Robots in disguise' hide from plot| publisher=University Wire| date=2003-04-25| first=Patrick| last=Rollens}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper| title=Return of the Transformers| newspaper=The Malay Mail| date=2002-07-17| first=Rizal| last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transported to a parallel Universe, as the walls of reality began to crumble, foretelling the coming of Unicron to the ''Armada'' universe, Optimus Prime and [[Jetfire]] were reformatted by their Mini-Con companions using the [[Mini-Con Matrix]] into new &quot;Powerlinx&quot; forms. Optimus Prime and Jetfire combined to hold the chaos-bringer at bay. Unicron was eventually defeated by the united power of the Mini-Cons.

Ten years after Unicron's defeat, Cybertron was seemimngly at peace, but Optimus still feared another attack from Unicron. Although the Autobot High Council dismissed his fears, a mental link with Primus confirmed that Unicron was still alive. Megatron's disembodied spark, trapped within the chaos-bringer, called out to Prime. Events overtook Prime as Unicron's four Horsemen, [[Rhinox]], [[Airazor]], [[Cheetor]], and [[Terrorsaur]], attacked Cybertron, devastating it. Prime's link with Primus allowed him to upgrade himself into his ''Energon'' form and drive them off.

Using the Spacebridge to travel to Earth, Prime was sidetracked when Megatron transported him to Unicron's body. Megatron attempted to cajole him into distracting Unicron long enough to transfer his consciousness into a new body. Prime refused until Megatron showed him what was happening on Earth. A massive [[Terrorcon]] invasion had devastated many of Earth's greatest cities, with the stalwart Autobot defenders nearly overwhelmed. Megatron offered to deal with the invasion if Prime would aid his rebirth. Out of options, Prime agreed, and battled Unicron's internal defences to disable a sensor, allowing Megatron's resurrection. As Megatron teleported to Earth to keep his end of the bargain, Prime, still inside Unicron, prepared to fight back.

Dreamwave's closure meant that resolution to the storyline was not accomplished, nor was the ''Cybertron'' era of the Dreamwave comics reached.

===Pack in comics===
{{Expert-subject|Transformers|section|Pack in comics|date=September 2011}}
&lt;!--
In the second ''Transformers: Energon'' pack-in comic, [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], [[Inferno (Transformers)|Inferno]], and [[Landmine (Transformers)|Landmine]] discover some hills on Earth rich with energon and request permission from Optimus Prime build an energon tower. Optimus agrees, but warns the Autobots that Decepticon activity has been detected nearby. [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]] attacks with a horde of [[Divebomb]] [[Terrorcon]] clones. The Autobots attempt to fight back by having Mirage and Inferno powerlink, while Landmine goes into 'brute' mode. However, they are overwhelmed when [[Insecticon]] Terrorcon hordes join in the attack. The Autobots retreat and Megatron takes the energon for himself.

What does any of this have to do with Optimus Prime? Yes, Optimus is mentioned, but that's it. This is just the story that takes place rather than a description of Optimus in this universe. I don't know anything about Optimus Prime, or I would do something about it myself, but I don't know enough about Pack in comics.

:Energon Optimus Prime stands 765 centimeters or 25 feet tall in super robot mode. With the toy standing 25 centimeters tall, he would be 1/31 scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffbee.com/reviews/fatimus.php |title=Transformer Toy Reviews: Energon Optimus Prime |publisher=Cliffbee.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Energon'' Deluxe Optimus Prime''' (2004)
:A Deluxe sized version of Energon Optimus Prime. Looks like a smaller version of the Leader class toy, without any trailer or drones. Can Powerlinx with other Energon Autobot toys.

:Leader class figure, this is his form used in the Cybertron television series. Can combine with Leobreaker (or Nemesis Breaker) and/or Cybertron Wing Saber, and can use Metroplex's axe or Vector Prime's sword. At first, '''Optimus Prime''''s ('''Galaxy Convoy''' in the Japanese version) alt-mode is a futuristic firetruck, although some believe it to be some sort of mobile weapons platform (the show itself treats it as a firetruck). This can also transform into a wing mode, with wings and cannons on each side of the truck. In addition to his standard robot mode, he can combine with his rear 'trailer' section to form a heavily armed super mode. That trailer section can also form an independent weapons platform, usable by anyone. His face, designed in the classic Prime style, merges the two mouth-plate elements - a slitted version to expose his mouth, like ''Beast Wars'' [[Optimus Primal]] did on the television series and a full mouth-plate which can rise to cover it.&lt;ref&gt;Hasbro Arrives at Toy Fair 2004 Loaded With the Industry's Premier Brands and a Wide-Range of Innovative New Toys and Games for the Entire Family. Business Wire; February 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
:Like most toys sold in the ''Galaxy Force'' toy line by Takara, then later in the ''Cybertron'' toy line by Hasbro, there are small paint differences between the two versions of the toy. The Hasbro version has a code number on the back of his [[Cyber Key]], while the Takara version has no number on his [[Force Chip]].
:There is some difference of opinion on how the super mode of Leader Class Optimus Prime is supposed to assembled. Takara toys and the television series portrayed with the wings up and his two large guns underslung, however Hasbro later sold the toy with pictures and instructions having the wings down and the guns over the shoulders. Commercials and repainted models by Hasbro went back to the way Takara assembled the super mode. In 2006 a Costco exclusive of Optimus Prime packaged with Wingsaber and a DVD (with Armada Supercon Optimus Prime printed on it!) of the episode ''United'' was sold, again with the wings-under gun-over super mode. In Japan a gold chrome edition of this toy was released as a [[Lucky Draw]] special.
:Early concept sketehes of this Optimus Prime showed that they intended to allow Optimus's Super Mode extras to combine with other Transformers to boost their power, but this idea seemed to be abandoned.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:optimusprime-bkcybertron.jpg|right|thumb|Cybertron Burger King Optimus Prime]] --&gt;
* '''''Cybertron'' Burger King Optimus Prime'''
:A kids meal toy giveaway about the size of a Scout class toy, but very simple. Transforms from truck to robot. Transformation of this toy is similar to the original Generation 1 Optimus Prime toy.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:optimusprime-cybertronlegends.jpg|left|thumb|Cybertron Legends Optimus Prime]] --&gt;
* '''''Cybertron'' Legends Optimus Prime'''
:There is also a smaller &quot;Legends of Cybertron&quot; Micro sized version of this Optimus Prime, without a trailer, and a Burger King Kid's Meal toy, again without a trailer. There is also a rotating sucker holder version of Cybertron Optimus Prime. Later releases of the Leader class and Micro class Optimus Prime were repainted in darker colors, supposedly representing Optimus Prime after the television story. This toy is called ''Galaxy Force Optimus Prime''. A special metallic painted version of this toy was included with Megalo COnvoy in Japan.
:In 2007 a Target store exclusive value pack of four Voyager class Cybertron toy was released. It included Jetfire, Megatron, Optimus Prime and Soundwave. All identical to their original releases.
:This toy was repainted as Classis Legends Menasor in 2007.
* '''T.H.S.-01 Galaxy Convoy'''

* '''''Cybertron'' Leader Galaxy Force Optimus Prime (2006)'''
:Darker repaint of Cybertron Leader Class Optimus Prime with 4 planet unity symbols on the shoulders. Some bonus packs of Galaxy Force Optimus Prime came with the Autobot [[Brakedown]] as a bonus item. Also this version comes with the Matrix of Leadership in side Optimus.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:tsoptimusprimecd.jpg|right|thumb|Cybertron Deluxe Optimus Prime]] --&gt;
* '''''Cybertron'' Deluxe Optimus Prime (2006)'''
:A repaint of the Armada Supercon Optimus Prime, minus the Mini-Con, but instead had a Cyber Key with a Mini-Con port in it. Repainted to match Cybertron Galaxy Force Optimus Prime. This is supposed to be a drone which Optimus Prime controls to get into small places, built for him by [[Metroplex]]. Several paint variations of this toy exist, and early releases have the forearms swapped, just as had occurred with the last repaints of the mold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffbee.com/reviews/cybprimer.php |title=Transformer Toy Reviews: Cybertron Optimus Prime (Armada Repaint) |publisher=Cliffbee.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Cybertron'' Deluxe Jungle Planet Optimus Prime (2006)'''
:There is also the release of Optimus Prime as a deluxe sized brown gorilla which is a repaint of the Beast Wars 10th anniversary Optimus Primal toy most likely trying to tie Optimus Prime in some way to the jungle planet Animatros in the Cybertron series. According to his bio, Optimus Prime was temporarily mutated into this form by the Animatros Cyber Planet Key. The colors of this toy are a homage to Transformers: Universe [[Optimus Primal]].
* '''''Attacktix'' Optimus Prime''' (2006)
:Series 1 of the [[Transformers Attacktix]] figures included Cybertron Optimus Prime figures in both vehicle and super robot modes. Series 2 included a flame orange repaint of the super robot mode.

The character Optimus Prime appears in the live action films ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'', ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]'', and ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' as the leader of the [[Autobot]]s and one of the main protagonists of the three films. In these movies, Optimus Prime is able to transform into a conventional [[Peterbilt 379]] cab, rather than the [[cab over]] design of his original ''Generation 1'' body. In Transformers: Dark of the Moon, he regains his first generation trailer. Also straying from the ''G1'' design, Prime's vehicle mode is now decorated with red flames painted onto a blue body Ã  la [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]], his ''Generation 1'' successor. The reason for the change was due to Director [[Michael Bay]]'s decree that [[Transformers technology#Mass displacement|mass displacement]] does not occur when they transform, requiring Optimus's vehicle form to have more mass to achieve the desired size in his robot form. According to Michael Bay, Optimus stands 28 feet tall, but, in an interview, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic|ILM]]'s Scott Farrar claimed that &quot;the movie's Optimus Prime is 35 feet tall and made of 10,108 parts - and every single one had to be modeled and painted when they came within camera range. This puts him taller than the movie's [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] and the same height as  [[Megatron (Paramount)|Megatron]] as well in the film.&quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Although the character was redesigned to some extent, like the other characters in the film, many classic design elements remain in his robot mode including a predominantly red torso, primarily blue legs, the presence of windows in his chest, smoke stacks on his shoulders, and a head design influenced by the original, featuring the iconic faceplate and ear finials. The faceplate is able to retract to reveal a mouth. His weapons include his iconic ion blaster stored in the form of the fuel tanks on his back, and a shell cannon stored on his back, two retractable energon blades that extend from both forearms, which is a homage to Prime's energy axe in the ''Generation 1'' animated series, two retractable energon hooks on both of his forearms, and bladed knuckles. The trailer contains an energy axe, a shield, and flight gear. In the later IDW comics, he displays the ability to produce a holographic driver, an ability mentioned in the early versions of the script. The appearance of this driver seems{{by whom|date=September 2010}} to be based on Peter Cullen himself.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

At [[Comic-Con International|San Diego ComicCon]] 06, it was announced that original Optimus Prime voice actor, [[Peter Cullen]], would reprise his role for the third film. Cullen has commented that Prime is basically the same in the third film as the previous two, and retains the same basic personality.

===Involvement in the films===

[[File:Optimusprimealtmoviemode.jpg|250px|thumb|left|A [[Peterbilt 379]] used in Transformers to portray Optimus Prime's alternate mode.]]
The character of Optimus Prime first appears in ''[[Transformers (film)]]'' as the leader of the Autobots in the search for the Allspark. After arriving and scanning a Peterbilt truck, Optimus greeted Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes, introducing his men and explaining why they had come to Earth. They escorted the humans back to Sam's house to retrieve the pair of glasses that would lead them the Allspark. When Sam and Mikaela were captured by a Sector 7 agent named Simmons, Optimus intercepted their car and surrounded the Sector 7 agents, curious that Simmons was not afraid or surprised by their appearance. When backup arrived, Optimus took the teens on his back and ran, taking cover under a bridge. Though Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee were captured, Optimus retrieved the glasses and prepared to lead his other men to get the Allspark, pointing out that, if it came to it, he would sacrifice himself by shoving the cube into his chest to prevent he Decepticons from getting control of the Allspark. When they discovered Bumblebee and the humans were free and being escorted by the military with the Allspark, Optimus joined their convoy. Along the way they, are attacked by [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)#Transformers|Bonecrusher]]. Optimus engages him, killing him by using his Energon blade. Arriving in the city, he briefly confronted Megatron, but was left stunned. When he recovered, he rescued Sam as he was falling from a building and warned him that if he could not defeat Megatron before going into battle, he needed to place the Allspark in his chest. Optimus is nearly defeated by Megatron before Sam kills the Decepticon by ramming the Allspark into his chest. Optimus is grateful to Sam for saving him, and he and the other surviving Autobots decide to remain on Earth since Cybertron cannot be restored without the cube. The film ends with Optimus sending out a deep-space signal, inviting other Autobots to join them on Earth.

Optimus Prime's character returns in ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''. He leads the Autobots as part of NEST in seeking and destroying remaining Decepticons on Earth. At the beginning of the film, the massive [[Decepticon]] [[Demolishor#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Demolishor]] is rampaging through [[Shanghai|Shanghai, China]], and Optimus parachutes out of a plane to take him on. Before he is killed, Demolishor tells them that the Earth is &quot;not theirs to rule&quot; and that &quot;the Fallen shall rise again&quot;. At the NEST base, Optimus tells Theodore Galloway that they do not know what The Fallen is and that if they are asked to leave Earth, the Autobots will comply. When the remaining Allspark shard is stolen, Optimus asks Sam for his help in convincing the Earth's leaders to allow the Autobots to stay, but Sam refuses. When Megatron is resurrected and Sam, Mikaela and Leo Spits are kidnapped, Optimus and Bumblebee attack the Decepticons holding them. Optimus fights Megatron, Starscream, and [[Grindor#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Grindor]] on his own to protect Sam in a forest. Though he manages to kill Grindor and rip Starscream's arm off, Optimus is ultimately killed by Megatron. His last words were for Sam to run. His body is taken to a military base where Galloway orders the Autobots to bring his body back to Diego Garcia. Meanwhile, Sam hears from Jetfire that &quot;The Fallen&quot; is an ancient Prime and that only a Prime could kill him. He also said that the Matrix of Leadership may be able to revive him. After a long battle with the Decepticons in [[Egypt]], Sam resurrects Optimus using the Matrix, but it is subsequently stolen by The Fallen. Because Optimus is still weak, Jetfire offers to sacrifice himself to help. Ratchet and Jolt convert parts from Jetfire into a jet mode for Optimus. Optimus flies over to the pyramids and destroys the Sun Harvester. After severely damaging Megatron, he successfully kills The Fallen, forcing Megatron and Starscream to retreat. At the end of the film, he thanks Sam for reviving him and again transmits a message to space, hoping to find more Autobots.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:OptimusPrimeTF3DOTM.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Optimus Prime in his primary appearance in ''Transformers: Dark of the Moon''.]] --&gt;
Optimus appears again in the 2011 film ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]''. Optimus receives his own armory consisting of weapons and flight tech that transforms into a trailer for him to carry in vehicular form. After assisting NEST operatives in fighting  [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] at Chernobyl, Optimus learns that the humans have concealed the discovery of a Cybertronian ship on the moon. He and Ratchet go to investigate the Ark, where they recover [[Sentinel Prime]], Optimus's predecessor and mentor. Optimus returns him to life using the Matrix of Leadership back on Earth, explaining how they lost the war and Cybertron has become a barren wasteland. Later Optimus shows Sentinel the natural beauty of Earth, and takes the opportunity to offer him the Matrix, but was allowed to keep it. Sentinel later betrayed the Autobots, having formed an alliance with the Decepticons because he wants to restore life to Cybertron. Optimus attempted to reason with Sentinel, but failed as several Decepticons came through a space bridge. After Sentinel Prime insisted that the humans expel the Autobots from Earth, the Wreckers prepare the Autobot ship Xantium for flight. Sam attempts to find out what their counter-attack plan is, but Optimus states they have none, and that Earth's fight is their own. During the departure, the Autobots escape in the first booster stage and return to Earth before Starscream destroys the ship. Arriving in Chicago, Optimus shoots down a Decepticon fighter as he tells Sam and Epps that he never expected the Decepticons to keep their word and that they are going to fight back. Optimus loses his trailer when Shockwave and his Driller arrive. He manages to retrieve it later and uses it as a flight pack, decaptitating the Driller's main head. During the battle, Optimus got caught in exposed wires and the Wreckers helped free him. Flying down onto the main battlefield, he abandoned his flight pack and used the momentum to attack and kill many Decepticons before he finally killed Shockwave. After using Shockwave's cannon to disable the control pillar for the space bridge, Optimus fights Sentinel Prime. Optimus Prime's right arm is cut off and Sentinel is about to end Optimus's life when Megatron intervenes and attacks Sentinel. After defeating Sentinal Prime, Megatron proposed a truce, but, instead, Optimus slices his head off, killing the Decepticon leader. Optimus then grabs Megatron's shotgun and prepares to execute Sentinel, who pleads for his life, saying that he betrayed Optimus just because he wanted to save their race. Optimus executes him anyway, replying that Sentinel betrayed himself. With the Decepticons defeated and the war finally over, Optimus and the Autobots accept Earth as their true home.

The 2000 film series incarnation of Optimus Prime was met with warm reception. It was named the 30th greatest movie hero of all time by &quot;[[Total Film Magazine]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.news.com.au/goodies-baddies-get-sorted/story-e6frfmq9-1111114966889| title=Top heroes and villians named in movie list| publisher=News.com.au| date=2007-11-26| accessdate=2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What they find is an ancient artifact that Megatron had restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0903/12/idwfirsts.htm |title=IDW Firsts 12 |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[IDW Publishing]]'s ''[[Transformers: Movie Prequel]]'' comic book, Optimus Prime and Megatron co-ruled [[Cybertron]] until Megatron began a war for control of the [[AllSpark#Transformers|Allspark]]. Optimus formed the Autobots, a militia of civilian transformers sworn to protect the Allspark. Optimus fought back, willing to doom Cybertron itself to deny Megatron the Allspark. His reasoning was that a new homeworld could be rebuilt with the Allspark once Megatron was no longer a threat. He entrusted [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)#Transformers|Bumblebee]] with the task of distracting Megatron at Tyger Pax long enough for the Allspark to be sent into space.

In ''[[Transformers: Alliance]]'', Optimus Prime and the Autobots aid the human soldiers after the battle in Mission City and destroy the Allspark-powered machines that were created. A trailer is obtained for Optimus Prime to carry the remains of Jazz. The Autobots leave Mission City as the Sector 7 personnel arrive to claim the remains of the Decepticons. About a month later, Epps and Lennox contact Optimus Prime about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to the naval yard. They are spied on by [[Barricade (Transformers)#Transformers|Barricade]], who transmitts the information to Starscream.
&lt;!--
After being rescued from control by the Initiative, Armorhide, Blaze Master, Brawn and Smokescreen join the Autobots at the NEST base on [[Diego Garcia]]. Optimus Prime insists they spend time there recovering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = John Barber| penciller = Carlos Magno| inker = Aburtov and Graphiksslava| story = | title = Transformers: Rising Storm| volume = 1| issue = 1| date = February 2011| publisher = IDW Publishing| location = | page = | panel = | id =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This part doesn't seem necessary. I feel like the article is drifting away from Optimus Prime, the topic at hand, and more towards the transformers story. Although background story is sometimes necessary to explain the background, the article should be more about Optimus than the transformers story.--&gt;

===Titan Magazines===
In [[Titan Magazines]]' [[List of Minor Transformers comics#Titan Magazines|UK Transformers magazine]], a comic strip on Optimus Prime, written by Simon Furman, would reveal where he was during the events of ''Movie Prequel #1''. As he carries out his fateful plan to send the Allspark into space, the Autobot base is attacked by one of Megatron's drones with specific orders to kill him. As it locates the Allspark, Prime does the only thing he could think of to prevent it from transmitting its location to Megatron. He transforms into [[protoform]] mode and physically rams through it. Recovering in time to see the Allspark blast off, Prime is granted a vision of their war on Earth.

''In &quot;Twilight's Last Gleaming&quot; part 3, [[Mikaela Banes]] attempts to free Optimus Prime, but is attacked by [[Frenzy (Transformers)#Transformers|Frenzy]]. In part 4, Mikaela frees Optimus Prime and freezes Frenzy. 

Optimus Prime would return in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called &quot;The Decepticon who Haunted Himself.&quot;

===Books===
Optimus Prime appears in the prequel novel ''[[Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday]]'', where he and a group of Autobots travel in [[Ark (Transformers)|the Ark]] searching for the Allspark, battling Starscream's Decepticons along the way. While going through a worm hole, the Autobots find themselves encountering a group of humans in a spacecraft reverse-engineered from studying Megatron. With this discovery, Prime realizes the significance of Earth, as both Megatron and the Allspark are there. After saving Bumblebee from a pit of rock-chewing cave worms, Prime battles Starscream. He is about to be gunned down by Starscream and [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)#Transformers|Bonecrusher]] when he is saved by the human craft. In retaliation, Starscream obliterates it.

Optimus Prime also appears as a character in the book [[Transformers: Dark of the Moon The Junior Novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0316186292 |title=Transformers: Dark of the Moon The Junior Novel |publisher=Ballantine Little, Brown Books for Young Readers |year=2011 |author=Michael Kelly }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyber Missions===
In the online CGI cartoon ''Cyber Missions'' produced by TG Studios for Hasbro's web site, Optimus is once again seen fighting Megatron, this time with some help from Sideswipe. Optimus also helps Ironhide against [[Mindwipe (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Mindwipe]].

===Video games===
In the ''Autobot Campaign'', Optimus Prime provides intelligence and missions to Bumblebee in his search for the Allspark. Eventually, the clues lead the Autobot to Sam Witwicky. After saving Sam from Barricade, Bumblebee finally completes preparations for the Autobots to arrive on Earth. Once on Earth and having informed the two teenagers of their mission, Prime and the Autobots are discovered by Sector 7. Optimus sends Jazz on a high-speed destruction distraction mission, then sends Ironhide to rescue Jazz from a double-threat posed by the government agents and various Decepticon scouts. When Bumblebee is captured, Prime transforms and chases the chopper which from which the small Autobot is tied. After a lengthy chase, Prime manages to catch the net, only to be thrown off by another Cybertronian meteor. As Bumblebee is carried away, Optimus promises he will not fail him again. Jazz informs him that the meteor is not an Autobot. Prime confronts the new threat, who turns out to be the Decepticon triplechanger [[Shockwave (Transformers)#Transformers|Shockwave]]. The two battle it out across Tranquility before Optimus finally destroys him. During the battle, Optimus overhears Starscream's transmission revealing the location of the Allspark. Optimus then returns to an intel role as he guides Bumblebee in his mission to retrieve the Allspark from Hoover Dam. Unfortunately, the Decepticons manage to free Megatron, leading to the final battle in Mission City. As the Autobots battle it out with the Decepticons to protect Sam and the Allspark, things seem to take a turn for the worst as Megatron finally arrives. Before he can claim the Allspark, Optimus attacks him. Optimus defeats Megatron and leaves him on the ground, seemingly devoid of life. However, just as Sam is giving the Allspark to Optimus, Megatron awakens, leaping at Optimus with his chain-flail out, making one last attempt at defeating his adversary. Optimus grabs the chain, pulling Megatron in closer, and, with the Allspark clutched in his fist, delivers a punch through Megatron's spark, killing him. Optimus reflects on the losses and rewards of this battle, as the Autobots have a new home, but many were killed in the battle. The story ends with Optimus and the Autobots choosing to remain in Earth, proclaiming it as their new home.

Optimus Prime appears near the end of the ''Decepticon Campaign''. Sam and Mikaela inform Optimus that all the Autobots were defeated by the Decepticons. Optimus proclaims that they sacrificed their lives to protect the Allspark, and their sacrifice will not be in vain. Leaving Sam and Mikaela in a safe place, Optimus faces Megatron, but is defeated. Weakened and damaged, Optimus crawls to reach the Allspark. However, Megatron attacks Optimus with his chain-flail, killing him.

In ''Transformers: Autobots'', Optimus Prime meets up with the other Autobots to give further commands to his troops. Create-A-Bot, the new rookie, is eager to help in the cause, but Optimus tells him to sit back while the other Autobots fight the Decepticons. Create-A-Bot finally defies orders and completes a mission against Optimus's council. After nearly getting himself and the other Autobots killed, Create-A-Bot apologizes to Optimus personally. Taking pity on the newcomer, Optimus lets him off with a stern warning, and they move out together to face Megatron, who has absorbed the power of the Allspark. Optimus fights Megatron, but Megatron gains the upper-hand. Optimus is on the verge of defeat when Create-A-Bot takes the Allspark and drives to Megatron's chest, weakening Megatron but mortally wounding himself in the process. Optimus fights Megatron again, defeating him. As Megatron is on the ground, he tells Optimus that if he kills him, the Allspark will be destroyed and Cybertron will never be restored. Optimus says to Megatron that he will do what he must do, then he raises his sword and kills Megatron, destroying the Allspark in the process. Create-A-Bot also dies, but not before telling Optimus his final request to make Earth the new home of the Autobots and to protect the humans. The game ends with Optimus sending a message to all surviving Autobots taking refuge among the stars.

In ''Transformers: Decepticons'', Optimus Prime lands on Earth along with the other Autobots to stop the Decepticons. Optimus does not appear until Megatron is released and Starscream escapes with the Allspark. Optimus fights Megatron, but is defeated and is killed while Megatron gives chase to his traitorous second-in-command.

Optimus Prime appears in the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' series in 2008 as a red [[semi-trailer truck]], able to be fitted with many &quot;trailer&quot; attachments, most notably one that effectively makes him a fire truck. Unlike the other Optimus Primes, this one is much younger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/animated/default.cfm?page=Bio&amp;character=optimus Character bios for Transformers Animated characters]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Optimus Prime is usually called &quot;Boss-bot&quot; by [[Bulkhead (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Bulkhead]] and &quot;Big Bot&quot; by [[Bumblebee (Transformers Animated)|Bumblebee]] (possibly a reference to Beast Wars).

Optimus has the ability to change any part of his robotic body into a [[tool]] or [[gadget]]. He has swing lines in his wrists. His wrists can also fire capture [[bolas]]. His arsenal includes a [[grappler]], fire extinguisher and a negative friction spray. It is interesting that, unlike all the previous series, his face can almost always be seen, because his mouthplate is retractable like in the 2007 live action film.

Animated Optimus Prime, in an Earth-based fire truck mode, appears as a hidden character in the ''Transformers'' Netjet video game by Hasbro.

Instead of being leader of the Autobots, Prime was actually a washout from the Elite Guard. Despite no longer being a member, he maintains his military ranking of &quot;Prime&quot;.

The scale chart released for the series indicates Optimus Prime stands about 22 feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/transformers-news-rumors/219891-share-some-tf-design-spoiler-4.html |title=Share some TF Design Spoiler |publisher=Tfw2005.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that in the Japanese translation of this series, the story has been changed to make it a prequel to the 2007 ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' live-action film. This makes this version of Optimus Prime an earlier version of the film character.

===Animated series===
In the animated series, Optimus Prime was originally in the Autobot Academy and friends with [[Sentinel Prime#Transformers Animated|Sentinel Prime]] and [[Elita One#Transformers Animated|Elita One]]. When Elita is lost on a planet dominated by giant spider-like aliens, he blames himself for leaving her behind, where she supposedly dies in the explosion of a wrecked Decepticon warship loaded with [[Energon]]. Sentinel doesn't forgive him for losing her and Optimus takes full responsibly for Elita's demise. [[Ultra Magnus (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Ultra Magnus]], who had high hopes for him, expels him and thus bars him from any position of the Elite Guard. However, Magnus pulls some strings so that Optimus could be captain of a strange Space Bridge repair crew composed of an old grumbler of a war vet named [[Ratchet (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Ratchet]], a fledgling [[Bumblebee (Transformers Animated)|Bumblebee]], and his fellow cadet, [[Bulkhead (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Bulkhead]]. Optimus is given command of the starship [[Omega Supreme]].

The series begins when Optimus and his crew, after picking up a disillusioned [[ninja]] named [[Prowl (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Prowl]], are sent to clear rubble from a space bridge passage. There, the Autobots stumbled upon the Allspark and are immediately attacked by [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Megatron]]'s battle cruiser, the ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]]''. Through treachery by Megatron's second-in-command, [[Starscream (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Starscream]], Megatron was fragged and the Autobots crashed on Earth in the early 21st century. After being in stasis under [[Lake Erie]] for 50 years, the Autobots awaken in [[Detroit]] of the near future, where they immediately discovered humans in need and became heroes of the city. During the battle for the possession of the Allspark, Optimus goes offline after defeating Starscream, only to be revived by [[Sari Sumdac]] and her Allspark-infused key.

In the episode &quot;Home is Where the Spark is&quot;, Optimus captures the Angry Archer, who had committed a robbery. Afterward, he and his group survive an attack from their hideout's old machinery secretly activated by Megatron's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transformersanimated.com/reviews/275/episode-4-home-is-where-the-spark-is |title=Transformers Animated |publisher=TransformersAnimated.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode &quot;Thrill of the Hunt&quot;, the Decepticon bounty hunter [[Lockdown (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Lockdown]] captures Optimus, who had a bounty on his head for the supposed death of Megatron. He is freed by Ratchet, who also recovered an EMP generator stolen from him millions of years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transformersanimated.com/reviews/281/episode-7-thrill-of-the-hunt |title=Transformers Animated |publisher=TransformersAnimated.com |date=2008-01-19 |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot;, Optimus discoveres that Elita did survive the ordeal with the giant spiders and was transformed into the technorganic Decepticon [[Blackarachnia#Transformers Animated|Blackarachnia]]. He offeres to try and help her, but is turned down violently as Blackarachnia has still not forgiven him. However, when she nearly dies trying to use the Allspark key to purge her organic half, Optimus saves her and repeats his offer to help her. She stings him instead, vowing that she will never trust him.

In the two-part episode &quot;Megatron Rising&quot;, Optimus loses his composure over the recent numerous Decepticon attacks coupled with the fact that Prowl had secretly placed the [[Dinobots#Transformers Animated|Dinobots]] on an island off the coast of Detroit instead of destroying them. He has Ratchet confiscate the Allspark key from Sari, which he loses when he is ambushed by [[Blitzwing#Transformers Animated|Blitzwing]]. Optimus also fails to stop a newly resurrected Megatron from acquiring the Allspark. He defeats Megatron by overloading the Allspark in his chest with Sari's key. In the process, the Allspark shatters into countless pieces, scattering all across Detroit.

In &quot;The Elite Guard&quot;, the Autobot Elite Guard, composed of Ultra Magnus, [[Jazz (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Jazz]], and Sentinel Prime, arrive on Earth to reclaim the Allspark. They don't believe Optimus' story about the Decepticons and Sentinel Prime wishes to have him court-martialled. When a fragment of the Allspark causes a production line to go haywire, Optimus finally stands up to Sentinel, retrieving the fragment, and earning praise from Ultra Magnus.

In &quot;Return of The Headmaster&quot;, Sentinel's body is hijacked by Henry Masterson and his [[Headmaster (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Headmaster]] unit. Optimus, amused at his rival's predicament, reluctantly regains Sentinel's body for him, which prompted Sentinel to actually thank him.

In &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;, Optimus is pressured by Sentinel to tell Ultra Magnus that his story about the Decepticons is untrue, but he refuses. Meanwhile, the on-board computer plots a train infused with a shard of the Allspark. When Ultra Magnus and Jazz set off there, Optimus suspects that the Decepticons are luring them into an ambush and rushes to their help, though Sentinel Prime tries to detain him. At first, Ultra Magnus doesn't believe him, but a short time later, Optimus is proven right as Starscream falls from the sky after being blasted by Megatron, much to Sentinel Prime's astonishment and fright. Starscream turns out to be alive, inflicting injury on Ultra Magnus. Optimus takes the affair into his own hands momentarily and, with Sentinel's aid, manages to apprehend the Decepticon. While Sentinel Prime deflects Starscream's shots with his power-shield, Optimus succeeds in taking Starscream by surprise and handcuffing him. When the shackled Starscream is delivered to the Elite Guard spaceship, Ultra Magnus admits Optimus Prime was right and allows him to stay on Earth in order to seek out the other fragments of the Allspark.

In &quot;A Fistful of Energon&quot;, Optimus Prime is informed by Ultra Magnus about Starscream's escape from prison. He is quite upset when he has heard that Prowl set out in search for him on his own. He orders Prowl to return, but he disobeyed him. Later, Prowl is bound and abandoned by Lockdown, who wants to get the bounty that Megatron had set on Starscream. But Optimus Prime, together with Bulkhead and Ratchet, succeed in finding and releasing Prowl.

In &quot;Black Friday&quot;, Optimus is blackmailled by Blackarachnia into helping [[Grimlock]] steal Meltdown's genetic modifier so he could use it to remove her organic half. Meltdown ends up doublecrossing her and Optimus and Grimlock work together to save her.

In &quot;Transwarped&quot;, after Sari realizes that she is not human, Optimus attempts to have Professor Isaac Sumdac and Sari reconcile with each other. Later, they encounter Masterson, who is piloting his headmaster unit on Starscream's decapitated body. He defeats Masterson by tricking him to transform into vehicle mode, which was impossible due to with the Headmaster unit on Starscream's body. Later still, during a melee with a rock creature that found its way to Earth when Bumblebee returned from his accidental transwarp, Optimus struggles to stop Sari, who goes out of control after using her key to upgrade herself.

In &quot;Predacons Rising&quot;, Bumblebee, [[Jetfire#Transformers Animated|Jetfire]], [[Jetstorm#Transformers Animated|Jetstorm]], Optimus, and Sentinel chase down the fugitive [[Waspinator#Transformers Animated|Wasp]], but lose him to Swoop while bickering about what to do with him. They go after Wasp, only to find out that Blackarachnia has captured him and turned him into Waspinator. When Waspinator malfunctions and explodes due to the instability of the transwarp field that mutated him, Blackarachnia contains the blast with her webs, resulting in an explosion that consumes them both. Optimus is saddened by this, unaware that she and Waspinator are still alive on another planet inhabited by animals.

In &quot;Human Error&quot; Parts 1 and 2, Soundwave captures the Autobots with the help of his minions, [[Laserbeak#Transformers Animated|Laserbeak]] and [[Ratbat#Transformers Animated|Ratbat]], in order to brainwash them. Part of Soundwave's elaborate scheme consists of tricking the Autobots into thinking they have turned human. Optimus Prime's human form is a male caucasian in his early 20s wearing a red jacket. Sari forms a group of &quot;Substitute Autobots&quot; which consists of [[Scrapper (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Scrapper]], [[Wreck-Gar#Transformers Animated|Wreck-Gar]], and [[Snarl (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Snarl]], to rescue them. They free the Autobots from Soundwave's control and Optimus grabbes Laserbeak to engage in a guitar vs. [[keytar]] battle with Soundwave, who used Ratbat. Optimus smashes Soundwave and Ratbat into pieces using Laserbeak in guitar mode, but Laserbeak grabs Soundwave's surviving components and flees.

In &quot;Decepticon Air&quot;, Optimus receives a secret distress call from the Elite Guard ship that is carrying Decepticon prisoners. During the flight, the ship enters an electrical storm, which revives an inactive [[Swindle (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Swindle]] and he frees other prisoners to take over the ship. Transwarping to the ship via Swindle's personal transport field, Optimus joins forces with the Elite Guard, rounding up most of the Decepticons in the end.

In &quot;Endgame&quot; 2-parter, Ratchet builds Optimus a jetpack attachment to help in the coming battle against the Decepticons. After some initial difficulty, Optimus is able to get the hang of the device, only to be shot down by Starscream's female clone, [[Slipstream (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Slipstream]]. Though Ratchet urges Optimus to use the Magnus Hammer, he is reluctant to do so, given his past with Ultra Magnus. In the end, he wields the weapon as the Lugnut-controlled Omega Supreme clones land on Earth. During the fight, Optimus manages to master the Magus Hammer's power in order t overwhelms Megatron to the point of being acknowledged by name. After a devastating battle, the last remaining Omega clones self-destruct due to Starscream's intervention. With Prowl's sacrifice, the Allspark is rebuilt into one as it forms a barrier around the Omega clone, along with Optimus and Megatron. Prowl's spirit pulls Optimus from the bubble just as the clone self-destructs with Megatron still trapped inside. Prime laments Prowl's passing before defeating a heavily damaged Megatron and sparing him the deathblow, saying that Megatron does not deserve the &quot;easy way out&quot;. He and his team return to Cybertron with Omega Supreme, the captured Decepticons, and Prowl's body and are greeted as the hero he had wished to be so long ago. The reconstructed Allspark, having a structure similar to the G1 incarnation of the Autobot [[Matrix of Leadership]], is hung around his neck.

===Fun Publications===
Optimus appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice actor play &quot;Bee in the City&quot;, voiced by David Kaye. In this story, Professor Sumdac attempts to create a teleportation system to get the Autobots to Cybertron, but an interaction with Sari's key ends up transporting Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Sari to Transtech Cybertron. There, they met [[Flareup (Transformers)|Flareup]] and are detained by Shockwave. Bumblebee teams up with ''Beast Wars'' Megatron to free his comrades, but must then stop Megatron from taking the key for himself. Afterward, the Autobots and Sari returned to their own dimension.

After the events of ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' the [[Stunticons]] set up a Stunt Convoy show in the city of Kaon and use it as cover to attempt to break [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Megatron]] out of his detention at [[Trypticon]]. Their attempts are thwarted thanks to the efforts of [[Cheetor]], Optimus Prime, and [[Sideswipe (Transformers)#Transformers: Timelines .282011.29|Sideswipe]]. The Stunticons are placed in detention with Megatron and an attempt to rescue them was made by the Decepticons [[Blot (Transformers)|Blot]], [[Mindwipe (Transformers)|Mindwipe]], [[Oil Slick (Transformers)|Oil Slick]], [[Scalpel (Transformers)|Scalpel]], [[Sky-Byte]], and [[Strika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = [[Marty Isenberg]], [[Derrick J.

A new Optimus Prime character appeared as the centerpiece for the 2008 [[BotCon]] exclusive toy set. This Optimus Prime leads the Autobots in a [[mirror universe]] where the Autobots are evil and the Decepticons are good.

According to his tech specs, during Cybertron's Golden Age of peace, Optimus Prime served among the guardians of Cybertron's accumulated knowledge. He hungered for power and, through his studies, he determined that military might was the only way to achieve his goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/convention-exclusives-246/optimus-prime-1616/ |title=Shattered Glass Optimus Prime |publisher=TFW2005.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimus Prime appears as leader of the Autobot forces in the ''Transformers: Timelines'' story &quot;[[Shattered Glass (Transformers)|Shattered Glass]]&quot; by [[Fun Publications]]. When [[Cliffjumper]], the Generation 1 character from a parallel universe, is seemingly discovered alive, Optimus welcomes his old friend back to the Autobot fold. After learning that Clffjumper is not the evil Autobot he remembers, he shoots Cliffjumper and leaves him to fend for himself in the Rad Zone. Optimus plans to launch his new warship, the ''Ark'', to conquer Earth, but Cliffjumper aids [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Timelines (Shattered Glass)|Megatron]]'s heroic Decepticon forces in a successful attack on the ''Ark'''s launch platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |colorist=Espen Grundetjern |date=Botcon 2008 |editor=Pete Sinclair &amp; Brian Savage |inker=[[Don Figueroa]] |issue=3 |letterer=Jesse Wittenrich |penciller=Don Figueroa |publisher=Fun Publications |story=Shattered Glass |title=Transformers Timelines |volume=2 |writer=Pete Sinclair &amp; Benson Yee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimus Prime also appears in the text-based fiction ''Dungeons &amp; Dinobots''. He commands the Autobots to attack the Arch-Ayr fuel dump. The attack is thwarted when the main Decepticon forces are augmented by the Mayhem Suppression Squad. When Wheeljack attacks both the Autobots and Decepticons with a massive force of drone Dinobots, Optimus offers to allow the outcast Autobot scientist to rejoin the Autobot ranks if the Dinobots destroy the Decepticons. The Dinobots prove unstable and go on a rampage, attacking everyone, including each other. Optimus punishes Wheeljack by having Ratchet painfully reformat him for Earth mode and assigning him to the Ark repair crew on the advice of Side Burn. He punishes Blurr for allowing his heroic Decepticon cousin, [[Crasher]], part of the Mayhem Suppression Squad, to live. When Grimlock returns to the Autobots, Optimus lets him live because the Dinobot has gained useful intelligence and helps in work on the Ark.

Megatron is captured by the Autobot Targetmasters in the episode &quot;Do Over&quot;. When Optimus learns Megatron has been captured, he rushes to be the one who kills his old enemy, despite the closing launch window of the Ark. When confronted by Optimus Prime, Megatron attempts to use the Autobot Targetmaster Nightstick to shoot the Autobot leader, but Nightstick takes control of Megatron's arm. Megatron then tricks Optimus into using Megatron's own sword to cut his hand off, freeing him from Nightstick. Optimus fails to kill his foe and misses the launching of the Ark, which has been taken over by Rodimus. He then takes out his anger on Blurr.

In &quot;Reunification&quot;, Optimus is seen building his new ultimate weapon, [[Omega Doom (Transformers)|Omega Doom]]. He learns that Megatron has supposedly been killed by watching a broadcast from the Autobot reporter [[Rook (Transformers)|Rook]]. When Kup leads the Autobots Camshaft, Hound, and [[Warpath (Transformers)#Transformers: Timelines|Warpath]], in an attempt to assassinate Optimus Prime, the Autobot leader easily defeats the four rebels. [[Alpha Trion#Transformers: Timelines|Alpha Trion]] then attempts to kill Optimus, but Optimus uses Omega Doom against the ancient robot. Prime then sends Doom against the Decepticons.

Optimus appears in a flashback in ''[[The Coming Storm (Transformers)|The Coming Storm]]'', shooting Nightscream.

Optimus Prime is the leader of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 computer animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-prime-39/botcon-2010-transformers-prime-panel-coverage-170054/ |title=BotCon 2010 &quot;Transformers: Prime&quot; Panel Coverage |publisher=TFW2005.com |date=2010-06-26 |accessdate=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this universe, Optimus is a veteran military commander and second in command who wields an ion blaster and a double bladed energon axe. He became the leader of the Autobots after [[Zeta Prime]] fell in battle, but is not certain he wants the responsibility. The war with the Decepticons was going badly, and it looked like there was no end in sight. He vowed to himself and to the warriors under his command that he would never surrender, never retreat, and never stop fighting until the Decepticons were defeated.

In the Transformers: Prime series he can form bladed weapons or blasters from his hands. He has telescopic vision and turns into a long-nose semi-trailer truck.

===Books===
Optimus Prime appears in the novel ''[[Transformers: Exodus - The Official History of the War for Cybertron]]''. Starts off as a data clerk '''Orion Pax''' who eventually is named &quot;Optimus Prime&quot;.

Optimus Prime appears in the novel ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]''.

===Video games===
Optimus Prime is one of the playable Autobot characters in the 2010 video game ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]''. In the Autobot campaign, he starts off as Optimus, a warrior who rallies his fellow autobots against the Decepticons following the reported death of their leader [[Zeta Prime]]. He succeeds in defending the Autobots' home city of Iacon from [[Starscream (other incarnations)#Transformers: Prime|Starscream]] and his forces. Optimus then receives a distress call from Zeta Prime. Knowing that this is most likely a trap set by [[Megatronus (Prime)|Megatron]], he proceeds anyway with a rescue mission. He lets himself, Bumblebee, and SideSwipe be captured by the Decepticons and is sent to a prison in Kaon, the decepticon capital, in an elaborate scheme to free Zeta Prime and all imprisoned Autobots. He frees all the other prisoners, and defeats [[Soundwave (Transformers)#Transformers: Generations|Soundwave]] and his minions Frenzy, Rumble, and Laserbeak, but he is too late to save Zeta Prime. After taking Zeta Prime's body back to the Autobot high council, he is bestowed upon the well earned title of Prime.

Optimus Prime is then informed that Megatron has infected the core of Cybertron with dark energon and is given the task to undo the damage done. After rescuing [[Omega Supreme#Transformers: War for Cybertron|Omega Supreme]], Optimus, Ironhide, and Prowl fight their way to the core, but it's too late. The core informs Optimus that it is far too corrupted. It can repair itself by shuting down, but it will take millions of years. By that time, Cybertron will have to become cold, barren, and uninhabitable. The core gives Optimus a small piece of itself, saying it will still survive as long as the piece does. Optimus accepts the burden and the core relinquishes the Autobot [[Matrix of Leadership]].

Realizing that the planet is dying, Optimus orders a mass evacuation of all Autobot cities, but many transport ships are destroyed by the Decepticon satellite [[Trypticon#Transformers: War for Cybertron|Trypticon]], under orders from Megatron that no one shall leave the planet. He orders the Aerialbots [[Jetfire#Transformers: War for Cybertron|Jetfire]], [[Silverbolt#Transformers: War for Cybertron|Silverbolt]] and [[Air Raid (Transformers)#Transformers: War for Cybertron|Air Raid]] to fly and destroy Trypticon. The aerial trio manages to destroy Trypticon's jet pack and send the Decepticon behemoth crashing into Cybertron, where Optimus Prime and the Autobots band together to narrowly defeat him, sending him plunging into a pool of raw energon. Optimus and the remaining Autobots volunteer to stay and defend Cybertron from Megatron for as long as possible while the rest evacuate the planet. He commissions a massive vessel known as &quot;[[Ark (Transformers)|the Ark]]&quot; to transport the remaining Autobots into space when the time comes.

In the [[Nintendo DS]] game ''War for Cybertron: Autobots'', Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are the initial two characters playable in the game.

Optimus Prime will appear in the next game, ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]''.

===Animated series===
In the war for Cybertron eons ago, Optimus states that he and Megatron fought side by side until Megatron left to join the Decepticons. After Cybertron became barren and lifeless, he and Megatron took their war to Earth, after which Megatron disappeared for three years. With Ratchet, Arcee, Bumblebee, Bulkhead, and Cliffjumper under his command, the Autobots were granted asylum on Earth by the US government if they kept the Decepticons at bay. However, in &quot;Darkness Rising&quot;, the Decepticons return, killing Cliffjumper and target Jack, Raf, and Miko, three children who were seen with Arcee and Bumblebee. Optimus requested they be brought to base and know the full story, much to Arcee and Ratchet's dismay. Megatron returned soon after, wielding Dark Energon and nearly killing Optimus and Ratchet with a horde of reanimated Cybertronian corpses. Optimus later fought Megatron on the latter's space bridge, which Megatron intended to use to bring forth an army of undead to conquer Earth. Though Optimus is nearly killed by Megatron, he is able to gain the upper hand, and leaves Megatron to his apparent destruction when the Autobots destroy the space bridge. However, Optimus later confided in Ratchet that he still mourns Megatron's death, as he had a small glimmer of hope he could be turned to good. However, he does not underestimate Megatron's succesor, Starscream.

In &quot;Scrapheap&quot;, Optimus and Arcee journey to the Arctic on a reconnaissance mission, but due to an infestation of Scraplets at the base, they are prevented from returning. Optimus and Arcee are nearly frozen to death by the hostile Arctic conditions, but, thanks to Jack, Raf, and Miko, they are saved.

In &quot;Sick Mind&quot;, Optimus is infected with the life-threatening Cybonic plague, prompting Arcee and Bumblebee to infiltrate the Nemesis to find a cure for the virus Megatron himself created. As Optimus grows weaker, he learns of Megatron's survival of the space bridge explosion. It was Bumblebee entering Megatron's mind via cortical psychic patch and retrieving the cure that saved Optimus. In the next episode, &quot;Out of His Head&quot;, Optimus is, surprisingly, saved by the revived Megatron when he intercepted Starscream's attempted nosedive to kill him.
