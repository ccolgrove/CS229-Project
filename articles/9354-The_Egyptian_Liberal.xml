{{Military ranks of Egypt}}

The '''[[Egypt|Egyptian]] Armed Forces''' are the largest in [[Africa]], and the [[Arab World]], and is the tenth largest in the world, consisting of the [[Egyptian Army]], [[Egyptian Navy]], [[Egyptian Air Force]] and [[Egyptian Air Defense Command]].

In addition, Egypt maintains large [[paramilitary force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;IISS Military Balance 2007, p.223&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Central Security Forces]], and the Border Guard Forces are under [[Ministry of the Interior (Egypt)|Ministry of the Interior]] control. The [[National Guard (Egypt)|National Guard]], comes under the control of the Ministry of Defence.

==Overview==
&lt;br/&gt;
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, the senior uniformed officer, is [[Field Marshal]] [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] and the Chief of Staff is Lt. Gen. [[Sami Hafez Anan]].

The Armed Forces' inventory includes equipment from different countries around the world . Equipment from the [[Soviet Union]] is being progressively replaced by more modern U.S., French, and British equipment, a significant portion of which is built under license in Egypt, such as the [[M1 Abrams]] [[tank]].

To bolster stability and moderation in the region, Egypt has provided military assistance and training to a number of other [[Africa]]n and [[Arab]] states. Although not a [[NATO]] member, Egypt remains a strong military and strategic partner and is a participant in NATO's [[Mediterranean Dialogue]] forum. The Egyptian military is one of the strongest in the region,&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/180382/Egypt#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked title=Egypt%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Egypt |date=|publisher=[[Britannica]] |accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gives Egypt regional military supremacy rivaled only by [[Israel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NATIV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpr.org.il/NATIV/2000-6/2000-6-shawnpinexs.htm |title=The Egyptian Threat and the Prospects for War in the Middle East |date=November, 2006|publisher=NATIV |accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; besides being the strongest in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VkOT4E8-Z_IC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;lpg=PA299&amp;dq=strongest+military+Africa+Egypt&amp;ct=result#PPA299,M1 |title=Global Diversity: Winning Customers and Engaging Employees Within World Markets|year=2006|publisher=Intercultural Press|accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt is one of the few countries in the [[Middle East]], and the only Arab state, with a [[reconnaissance satellite]] and has launched another one in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1167467733037&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Egypt to launch first spy satelllite|date=|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|accessdate=2009-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armed Forces enjoy considerable power and independence within the Egyptian state.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cambanis|first=Thanassis|title=Succession Gives Army a Stiff Test in Egypt|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/world/middleeast/12egypt.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=11 September 2010|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also influential in business, engaging in road and housing construction, consumer goods, resort management,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2011&quot; /&gt; and vast tracts of real estate. Much military information is not made publicly available, including budget information, the names of the general officers and the militaryâs size (which is considered a state secret).&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2011&quot; /&gt; According to journalist Joshua Hammer, &quot;as much as 40% of the Egyptian economy&quot; is controlled by the Egyptian military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/aug/18/egypt-who-calls-shots/  Egypt: Who Calls the Shots?](relevance?)

Senior members of the military can convene for the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], so during the course of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], when Mubarak resigned and transferred power to this body on February 11, 2011.&lt;ref name=wt&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/11/crowds-rejoice-egypts-mubarak-steps-down/ |author=Murdock, Heather |title=Crowds rejoice as Egyptâs Mubarak steps down, hands power to military| publisher=[[The Washington Times]]| date=February 11, 2011| accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egyptian Mirage 5 at Cairo-West 1985.JPEG|thumb|Egyptian Mirage 5 at Cairo-West 1985]]
Although the '''Egyptian Navy''' is the smallest branch of the military, it is large by Middle Eastern standards. 
The Egyptian Navy is known to be the strongest in the African continent,  and the largest in the Middle East in spite of the rapid growth of other countries' navies within the region.

Some fleet units are stationed in the [[Red Sea]], but the bulk of the force remains in the Mediterranean. Navy headquarters and the main operational and training base are located at Ras el Tin near Alexandria.
The current commander is [[Vice Admiral]] [[Mohab Mamish]].

The Navy also controls the [[Egyptian Coast Guard]]. The Coast Guard is responsible for the onshore protection of public installations near the coast and the patrol of coastal waters to prevent smuggling. it has an inventory consisting of about thirty five large patrol craft (each between twenty and thirty meters in length) and twenty smaller Bertram-class coastal patrol craft built in the United States.
