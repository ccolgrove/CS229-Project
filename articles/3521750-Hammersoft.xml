The [[Oklahoma City Zoo]] capitalized upon the popularity of &quot;I Want A Hippopotamus for Christmas&quot; with a fundraising campaign to &quot;buy a hippo for Gayla&quot;. The fund raised $3,000, and a baby hippopotamus named Matilda was purchased and was presented by Peevey to the [[zoo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mistletunes.com/novel50.html Novelty Nook, Fifties and Sixties], [http://www.mistletunes.com Mistletunes.com] (accessed May 11, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
