His five page charge sheet listed thirteen general allegations, that were essentially identical to those of [[Jabran Said bin al Qahtani]], [[Binyam Ahmed Muhammad]], and [[Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi]].  Sufyian Barhoumi, Jabran Said bin al Qahtani, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, and two other captives, [[Binyam Ahmed Muhammad]], and [[Omar Khadr]] had their charges confirmed on the same day as Barhoumi.  Sufyian Barhoumi, Jabran Said bin al Qahtani, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, and Binyam Ahmed Muhammad all faced conspiracy charges.  Omar Khadr faced both murder and conspiracy to murder charges.

In July 2006, after considering [[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]], the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that the President lacked the [[United States Constitution|Constitutional Authority]] to order Military Commissions.  The Supreme Court ruled that only the [[United States Congress]] had the authority to order Military Commissions.  So the charges against all ten men were dropped.

On 29 May 2008
Barhoumi,
Jabran al-Qathani
and
Ghassan Abdullah al-Sharbi
were charged before the Congressionally authorized military commissions.&lt;ref name=TheJurist20080530&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carol J. Williams]], writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reports that all five men had been connected by [[Abu Zubaydah]] -- one of the three captives the CIA has acknowledged was interrogated using the controversial technique known as &quot;[[waterboarding]]&quot;.

Williams quoted the men's attorneys, who anticipated the five men would be re-charged in thirty days.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes2008-10-21/&gt;
They told Williams that: ''&quot;... prosecutors called the move procedural&quot;,''
and attributed it to the resignation of fellow Prosecutor [[Darrel Vandeveld]], who resigned on ethical grounds.  Williams reported that [[Clive Stafford Smith]] speculated that the Prosecution's dropping of the charges, and plans to subsequently re-file charges later was intended to counter and disarm the testimony Vandeveld was anticipated to offer, that the Prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence.

==Habeas corpus petition==
Barhoumi had a writ of [[habeas corpus]] filed on his behalf, Civil Action No. 05-cv-1506, by pro bono attorneys from [[Holland &amp; Hart LLP]].

On September 24, 2009 [[Carol Rosenberg]], writing in the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', reported that [[U.S. District Court Judge]] [[Rosemary Collyer]] had ruled that the USA could continue to hold Sufiyan in Guantanamo.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald2009-09-24&gt;
