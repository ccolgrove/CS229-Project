[[Amnesty International]] named him a [[prisoner of conscience]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AI2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/pdf/POC%20List.pdf |title=Myanmar, Unlock the Prison Doors! |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hip-hop career==
In 2000, Zayar Thaw's band [[Acid (hip-hop)|Acid]] released Burma's first hip-hop album. Despite predictions of failure by many in the Burmese music industry, the album, ''Beginning'', remained in the number one position of the Burmese charts for more than two months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/print_article.php?art_id=18128 |title=Another Birthday behind Bars |author=Alex Elgee |date=26 March 2010 |work= |publisher=''The Irrawaddy'' |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Democratic Voice of Burma]] reporter described his music as blending a &quot;combative, angry style with indigenous poeticism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DVB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvb.no/uncategorized/fresh-blood-for-a-new-decade-2/2845 |title=Fresh blood for a new decade |author=Joseph Allchin |date=30 December 2009 |work= |publisher=Democratic Voice of Burma |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band's repertoire has been said to contain many &quot;thinly veiled attacks on the regime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/burma,,junta-imprisons-pop-star,25495 |title=Junta imprisons Yan Yan Chan |author= |date=18 April 2008 |work= |publisher=thefirstpost.co.uk |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' stated that while the band &quot;focused on the mundane, their lyrics inevitably touched on the hardships of life in Burma, drawing them into dangerous territory.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/burma-jails-comedian-for-45-years-1029913.html |title=Burma jails comedian for 45 years |author= |date=22 November 2008 |work= |publisher=''The Independent'' |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zayar Thaw also became known early on for his social activism. At one concert, he teamed with poets [[Saw Wai]] and [[Aung Way]] to raise money for a charity for HIV-positive orphans founded by the comedian [[Zarganar]]. Along with fellow rapper [[Nge Nge]], Zayar Thaw also visited Zarganar's orphanages to help teach English to the children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt;

==Generation Wave activism and arrest==
Zayar Thaw is one of four founding members of [[Generation Wave]], a youth movement opposed to the [[State Peace and Development Council]], Burma's military rulers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt; The group was founded on 9 October 2007, following the anti-government protests popularly known as the [[Saffron Revolution]], and used graffiti and pamphlets to spread pro-democracy messsages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt; Zayar Thaw reportedly developed one of the group's more widespread campaigns, bumper stickers reading &quot;Change New Government&quot; to apply to cars carrying &quot;CNG&quot; stickers (for &quot;compressed natural gas&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Irrawaddy&quot;/&gt; The group also circulated anti-government films, including [[Rambo IV]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt; in which the titular character battles [[Tatmadaw]] (Burmese military) soldiers in [[Karen State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burmacampaign.org.uk/index.php/news-and-reports/news-stories/Rambo-Draws-World-Attention-to-Forgotten-Crisis-in-Burma |title=Rambo Draws Worldâs Attention to Forgotten Crisis in Burma |author= |date=12 Feb 2008 |work= |publisher=Burma Campaign UK |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had been banned by the government for portraying the SPDC and its soldiers in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1579082/Banned-Rambo-film-hot-property-in-Burma.html |title=Banned Rambo film hot property in Burma |author=Thomas Bell |date=18 February 2008 |work= |publisher=''The Telegraph'' |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2010, about thirty members of the group had been imprisoned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8518137.stm |title=Burma's youth rapping for change |author=Rachel Harvey |date=24 February 2010 |work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Zayar Thaw, who was arrested at a Yangon restaurant with friends on 12 March 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:elD48Vpaw3kJ:www.fbppn.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Zayar_Thaw_updated_29June09.pdf+Zayar+thaw+AAPP&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShKj5EAUwNvhS8TgWkCItbnbL7neJnxI1MUDU0gQCvV349q_xJBEufb2nsMGJ74qTlH9dsbtrpS_-sAI3Sk5fQmxD4HkmSywBoSDMEEK6t5wnyLClFWq5xp_Cj49Ire2b9w5HJ7&amp;sig=AHIEtbShPsRNV_Xy7Un_jusqrH3bX2j6rw |title=AAPP Case No. 0062 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Assistance Association for Political Prisoners |accessdate=7 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Zayar Thaw's Acid co-founder [[Yan Yan Chan]] was also arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=11455 |title=Popular Burmese Rap Performer Arrested |author=Min Lwin |date=18 April 2008 |work= |publisher=''The Irrawaddy'' |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and imprisonment==
Zayar Thaw was allegedly beaten during his interrogation.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/iar/pdf/ZayarThawCaseSheet.pdf |title=MYANMAR: Hip-Hop Artist and Student Activist Jailed for Peaceful Protest |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November 2008, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for breaking State Law and Order Restoration Council Law No. 6/88,&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt; &quot;illegal organizing under the Unlawful Association Act&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mizzima&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mizzima.com/news/breaking-and-news-brief/1334-5-generation-wave-activists-sentenced.html |title=5 Generation Wave activists sentenced |author= |date=20 November 2008 |work= |publisher=Mizzima News |accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International described this statute as &quot;a vaguely worded law whose sweeping provisions can be interpreted as making it illegal to set up any kind of organization&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI&quot;/&gt; He was given an additional year's imprisonment for possession of foreign currency, as he had been carrying approximately $20 USD in Thai [[baht]], [[Singapore dollar]]s, and Malaysian [[Malaysian ringgit|ringgit]] at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI&quot;/&gt;

Before his sentencing, Zayar Thaw told reporters, &quot;I feel sad, but not because of my imprisonment... I feel sad for the future of our country and people when I think about these facts. These words come from my heart. I wish to say to people, 'Have the courage to reject the things you donât like, and even if you donât dare to openly support the right thing, donât support the wrong thing.' &quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt; His sentence was condemned by Amnesty International, who named him a [[prisoner of conscience]] and called for his immediate release.&lt;ref name=&quot;AI2&quot;/&gt; He served his sentence at [[Kawthaung]] prison and was released on 17 May 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAPP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mizzimaburmese.com/interview/8042-2011-07-28-04-33-26.html|title=áá¼ááºáá°á· áá¬áá»ááºááá¶áá¬á¸áá¾á¯áá­á¯ á¡áá¯ááá¬áááºáá®á¸áá»ááºáááº|date=29 July 2011|work=ááá¹áá­áááááºá¸áá¬á|language=Burmese|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, Zayar Thaw was banned by the [[Mingala Taungnyunt Township]] Police Station from performing at a stage show on [[Kandawgyi Lake]]'s Hmyawzin Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/5724-hip-hop-singer-zay-yar-thaw-forbidden-to-perform-in-charity-show.html|title=Hip-hop singer Zay Yar Thaw forbidden to perform in charity show|last=Phanida|date=4 August 2011|work=Mizzima News|accessdate=7 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
