==Series synopsis==
=== Season 1 ===
The show begins with Muslim Brotherhood student demonstrations at [[Al-Azhar University]] and [[Cairo University]] campuses in protest of vote rigging in the 2006 student union elections. At Al-Azhar, demonstrators hold a military-like parade that causes controversy as many observers question the group's claim of renouncing violence. Upon their arrest, the Muslim Brotherhood student suspects are interviewed by a police officers. One of the police officers ('''Ashraf Helal''') refuses to interview them because he knows nothing about them. Helal looks for books about the Muslim Brotherhood but finds that there are too many about the subject. Later, he meets an old female friend ('''Shirin''') and tells her about his station. She suggest that he talks to her grandfather ('''Chancellor Abdallah Kassab'''), who gives Helal a list of books to read about the Muslim Brotherhood and its founder, '''[[Hasan al-Banna]]'''. The show then depicts Hasan al-Banna's life, from his childhood to the banning of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1948. During the season, the show jumps back and forth between Al-Banna's time and the present time.

Critics of the show, led by Al-Banna's son Saif Al-Islam, have accused the series' scriptwriter Wahid Hamed of defamation, making false claims and attempting to distort the image of his father and the group as extremists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramadan series rock the boat&quot;&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=185820 Ramadan series rock the boat]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&quot;I sent [those in charge of the TV series] a warning last week, calling on them to suspend the broadcast and give me a copy of the script to revise. But when they did not respond, I filed the lawsuit against them a few days later&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramadan series rock the boat&quot; /&gt;'''|Saif Al-Islam Hassan al-Banna|Hassan Al-Bannaâs son

Saif Al-Islam filed a lawsuit against Wahid Hamed and the Egyptian television stations that broadcast the program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brotherhood founder's son files lawsuit against TV series writer, producers&quot;&gt;[http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=122293&amp;catid=1&amp;Itemid=183 Brotherhood founder's son files lawsuit against TV series writer, producers]&lt;/ref&gt; The Cairo Economic Court looked into the lawsuit filed against the scriptwriter of the TV series and its producer, the [[Egyptian Radio and Television Union]] (ERTU).&lt;ref name=&quot;Brotherhood founder's son files lawsuit against TV series writer, producers&quot; /&gt;

The Muslim Brotherhood argues that the series depicts them as a violent, fundamentalist group, whose leaders are deceptive businessmen merely hungry for authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brotherhood founder's son files lawsuit against TV series writer, producers&quot; /&gt; The Muslim Brotherhood quickly decided to retaliate by producing its own series portraying the movement's history. &quot;''Hassan Al-Banna: '''The Journey Did Not End'''''&quot; is a 32-episode series to be filmed immediately after [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramadan series rock the boat&quot; /&gt;

The government of [[Hosni Mubarak]] has been accused of influencing the series to present the Brotherhood in a thoroughly negative light (and conversely to present the Egyptian regime, particularly the [[State Security Intelligence Service|State Security apparatus]], in a thoroughly positive light) ahead of the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2010|Egyptian parliamentary elections of 28 November 2010]], in which the Brotherhood forms the larges opposition bloc to the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/news/tv-show-muslim-brotherhood-stirs-outrage |title= TV show on Muslim Brotherhood stirs outrage|author=Noha El-Hennawy |date=17 August 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Al-Masry Al-Yaum]] |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====An error in the Qur'an====
In one scene during sixth episode of the series, in which Sheikh Mohammed Zahran and young Hassan al-Banna are arguing, Sheikh Mohammed Zahran recites a verse from the Qur'an, accidentally changing a word and thus causing controversy. The verse (number 199 from ''[[Sura]] [[Al-A'raf]]'') is &quot;'''''Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; But turn away from the ignorant'''''&quot;.
