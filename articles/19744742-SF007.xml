Skid Row continued for two years on Amiga before internal conflicts led to them disbanding, with members like Blackhawk returning back to resurrect Paradox. Between 2004 and 2007 they seemed to have faded away, but since 2007 they have released many things: trainers, games and cracks. Although they were releasing many games, they truly became well known in the gaming community after cracking Ubisoft's first DRM version. Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic and Assassin's Creed II utilize this type of protection, and both have been cracked by SKiDROW, among many other games. Ubisoft's second DRM version has also been cracked by them, in games such as From Dust and Shaun White Skateboarding. Their most recent release is Assassin's Creed: Revelations for PC that was released 9 days before the official date.&lt;ref&gt;http://n4g.com/news/893016/assassins-creed-revelations-pc-leaked-a-week-before-official-release&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated}}
Tristar and Red Sector, Inc. (also known as ''TRSI'') began as an alliance between two warez groups: Tristar and [[Red Sector Incorporated]]. They were formed in 1990 as a cooperative [[Commodore 64]] demo coding and cracking group. TRSI migrated from the Commodore 64 release platform to the Amiga and IBM-PC, and eventually branched off into the console gaming scene before finally disbanding their warez division.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tristar and Red Sector Incorporated]]&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2003, TRSI became inactive and remains so today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trsi.org TRSI's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntonic Crackers==
Syntonic Crackers was started in 1997 by uNDeRWoRLD and CyBorg in a Dutch regional town. After a major diskcrash, thousands of patches and keygens collected between 1991-1996 by TUWBBS (a 046-region based Bulletin Board System) got lost. The BBS sysop (Underworld) and co-sysop (Cyborg) decided to switch from DOS to the much disliked Win95. This event marked the end of TUWBBS, the Dutch HQ for groups TPiNC (Dutch-based Techno Products, Inc.), MCC (Belgian Mack Crack Corp.), pHROZEN cREW, and UCF (German-based United Cracking Force). Both sysops cracked DOS software for several years producing only Cracks&amp;Patches and went on the Win95 challenge for a summer project: Syntonic Crackers. During one summer holidays, Syntonic released over 150 keygens for Windows software, proving that Win95 software was fairly easy to reverse-engineer compared to MS-DOS products. Their aim was to deliver only few-KB sized releases that would technically compete releases of other groups like pHROZEN cREW who were very productive and often cracked the same software. The group stopped it's activities a year later.

==Techno Products, Inc.==
TPiNC was a Dutch cracking group in the pre-internet era mainly cracking DOS-software, BBS-software, and producing crypters and decrypters for executable files. The group consisted of 4-5 members all based in The Netherlands. They organised one of the first cracking parties in The Netherlands before the rise of the internet. The first TPiNC party, publicly held in Tilburg, was attended by a international crew of crackers and virus-writers from Poland, Belgium and Germany (United Cracking Force).
