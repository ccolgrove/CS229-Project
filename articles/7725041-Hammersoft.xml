'''Turner Broadcasting System Europe''' is the company managing the collection of [[cable television|cable]] [[television network|network]]s around [[Europe]].

Turner Broadcasting System Europe operates the following brands: [[CNN International]], [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], [[TCM]], [[TNT Film]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Boing (disambiguation)|Boing]]. The availability of these brands depends on what country in Europe the viewer is from. The most available brands include [[CNN]] and [[TCM]]

==Involvement in Freeview==
There were plans to launch a timeshare channel containing [[Boomerang (UK &amp; Ireland)|Boomerang]], [[CNN International]] and [[Turner Classic Movies (UK)|TCM]], on the digital terrestrial free-to-air platform [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] at launch in October 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/terrestrial/a9483/freeview-goes-live.html|title=Freeview goes live|date=2002-10-30|accessdate=2008-07-07|last=Wilkes|first=Neil|publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations with [[National Grid Wireless|Crown Castle UK]] broke down in 2003. [[CBM TV]] was due to replace the planned channel from Turner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/may/07/broadcasting.digitaltv|title=CBM fills breach after Turner talks collapse|date=2003-05-07|last=Gibson|first=Owen|accessdate=2008-07-07|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical faults and interruptions==
On July 27, 2006 in the UK, [[Cartoon Network (UK)|Cartoon Network]], [[Turner Classic Movies (UK)|TCM]], [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|Boomerang]], [[Toonami (UK)|Toonami]], [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|Boomerang]] +1 and [[CN Too]] have been suffered a major technical fault due to a power cut in [[Soho (London)|Soho]], [[London, United Kingdom|London]]. This was due to the energy supplier [[EDF Energy|EDF]] cutting power from different parts of Soho one at a time for four hours, purposely, due to the inability as the [[2006 European heat wave]] had hit Turner Broadcasting System Europe.

The power cut caused a mix up of channels (''i.e.'' Cartoon Network being broadcast on [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|Boomerang]] and Toonami, with [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|Boomerang]] being broadcast on [[CN Too]]). [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|Boomerang]] +1 was off air for some time, while [[Turner Classic Movies (UK)|TCM]], reverted between [[Turner Classic Movies#France|TCM France]] and other programming during the times it was able to provide a service. [[TCM 2]] didn't have a power cut because of its downtimes of timesharing. Most advertising was suspended and several of the channel [[website]]s were offline also.
However, Those who could still receive the channels had a backup transmission played out, making people curious into why the incorrect programmes were played out when compared to the EPG [[CN Too]] and [[Boomerang (British TV channel)|Boomerang]] were showing episodes of [[The Flintstones]].
These backups where played out with a scrolling message which said &quot;We apologise for the disruption to this service. This is due to technical difficulties. We will resume normal programming as soon as possible&quot; in multiple languages. Whilst most channels returned to the air relatively quickly, it took longer for [[CN Too]] to resume programming and it was also joked on various animation based forums by Toonami UK viewers, many of whom have made note of their disdain for the direction in which Turner took the Brand in the UK, that the backup transmission was more entertaining, purely on the basis that there's no live action aired during the black out.
The idents on Toonami which aired between shows during the black-out displayed the message &quot;Sorry! Toonami is broken, we'll be right back as soon as we fix it.&quot;. These idents have since been re-used in disclaimers warning viewers not to try stunts on various shows at home.
