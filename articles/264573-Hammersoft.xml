The '''University of Oregon''' ('''UO''') is a [[State university system|public]], [[coeducation]]al [[research university]] in [[Eugene, Oregon]], [[United States]]. The second-oldest public university in the state, UO was founded in 1876 and graduated its first class two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uoregon.edu/our-history University of Oregon: Our History]&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Oregon is one of sixty members of the [[Association of American Universities]]. The [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]] classifies the University of Oregon as a &quot;very high research activity&quot; university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uonews.uoregon.edu//archive/news-release/2011/1/uo-improves-top-tier-us-research-institutions |title=UO improves into top tier of U.S. research institutions |date=January 25, 2011 |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:1893 Class Marker, University of Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|1893 Class Marker, near Villard Hall]]
The [[Oregon State Legislature]] established the university on October 12, 1872, despite the new state's funding woes.&lt;ref name=&quot;125AnnivEarly&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anniversary.uoregon.edu/history/index.html |title=125th Anniversary: History of the University of Oregon; Early History |publisher=Anniversary.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents of Eugene struggled to help finance the institution, holding numerous fundraising events such as strawberry festivals, church socials, and produce sales. The doors officially opened in 1876, with [[Deady Hall]] its sole building. The first year of enrollment contained 155 students taught by five faculty members. The first graduating class was in 1878, graduating five students.&lt;ref name=&quot;125AnnivEarly&quot;/&gt; In 1881, the university was nearly closed, over $8,000 in debt before [[Henry Villard]] donated $7,000 toward the payment of the debt.&lt;ref name=&quot;125AnnivEarly&quot;/&gt;

During [[Prince Lucien Campbell]]'s tenure as president from 1902 to 1925, the university experienced tremendous growth compared to its early years. The budget, enrollment, facilities, and faculty members all grew several times its amount prior to his presidency. Numerous schools were also established during his tenure, including the School of Music in 1902, the School of Education in 1910, the [[University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts|School of Architecture]] and College of Business in 1914, the [[University of Oregon School of Law|School of Law]] in 1915, the School of Journalism in 1916, and the School of Health and Physical Education in 1920. However, the University of Oregon lost its School of Engineering to [[Oregon Agricultural College]], now known as [[Oregon State University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;125AnnivBoom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anniversary.uoregon.edu/history/index.html |title=125th Anniversary: History of the University of Oregon; University Boom |publisher=Anniversary.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zorn-MacPherson Bill in 1932 proposed that the University of Oregon and [[Oregon State College]] (now &quot;University&quot;), to be merged into one university. The bill lost in a landslide vote of over 6 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/archives/archive/mss/zorn_macpherson_des.html |title=Zorn-Macpherson Bill Collection, 1926-1932 |publisher=Osulibrary.oregonstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Oregon Medical School, originally founded in 1887 in Portland and merged with [[Willamette University]]'s program in 1913, officially became an independent institution in 1974 known as [[Oregon Health Sciences University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2006/02/05/News/Uo.Considers.New.Medical.School-1965052.shtml |title= UO considers new medical school |accessdate=April 5, 2009 |last=Sylwester |first=Eva |date=2006-02-05 |publisher=Oregon Daily Emerald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colleges and schools===
The University of Oregon is organized into eight schools and collegesâsix professional schools and colleges, an Arts and Sciences College and an Honors College.

==== School of Architecture and Allied Arts ====
The [[University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts|School of Architecture and Allied Arts]] (called &quot;triple-A&quot; or &quot;AAA&quot;) was founded by [[Ellis F. Lawrence]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aaa.uoregon.edu/info/ About the University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The school offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in architecture, art, including digital arts, arts and administration, art history, historic preservation, interior architecture, landscape architecture, and planning, public policy and management, and product design. The school also offers an architectural program, digital arts program, and product design program in [[Portland, Oregon]].

The school offers the only accredited degree in architecture, landscape architecture, and interior architecture in Oregon. The [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] accredits both the undergraduate bachelor of architecture five-year degree and the master of architecture. Other nationally accredited degrees include the planning and public administration, landscape architecture, and interior architecture programs. The undergraduate architecture program is consistently ranked among the highest in the country, and is currently ranked as the #1 public program for &quot;Sustainable Design Practice and Principles&quot; by ''DesignIntelligence'' magazine.

== Campus ==
{{Main|University of Oregon campus}}

[[File:Villard Hall east.jpg|thumb|right|Villard Hall]] The campus is spread over {{convert|295|acre|ha}} and holds sixty major buildings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uoregon.edu/about.shtml About the UO - University of Oregon]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as providing a home for more than 500 varieties of trees.&lt;ref name=TreeAtlas&gt;{{cite book |author=Office of University Planning |title=University of Oregon Atlas of Trees |year=1996 |publisher=University of Oregon Books |isbn=0871142937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene is located near many prominent geographic features such as the [[Willamette River]], [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Also within a two-hour drive is the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] metropolitan area.

Based on Ellis F. Lawrence's vision, many of the University's buildings are planned around several major quadrangles, many of which abut the 13th Avenue pedestrian mall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uoregon.edu/~uplan/CampusPlan/CampusPlan1991/1991_LRDPIntro.pdf] (PDF) {{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university is known for being the site of a pioneering participatory planning experiment known as the [[Oregon Experiment]], which is also the subject of a book of the same name that evolved into the well known book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'' by [[Christopher Alexander]]. The two major principles of the project are that buildings should be designed, in part, by the people who will ultimately use them with the help of an &quot;architect facilitator&quot;, and that construction should occur over many small projects as opposed to a few large ones.

Although academic buildings are spread throughout the campus, the majority are located along East 13th Avenue, with heavy pedestrian traffic at the intersection with Kincaid Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Trevor | last = Davis | title = Could Hilyard be safer? | publisher = Oregon Daily Emerald | date = April 26, 2007 | url = http://www.dailyemerald.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=656e547a-4144-439d-a0c8-cba8ddcbcef7 | accessdate = 2008-02-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080301190600/http://www.dailyemerald.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticle&amp;ustory_id=656e547a-4144-439d-a0c8-cba8ddcbcef7 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student recreation and union centers are located toward the center of the campus, with residence halls on the east side of campus. Sports facilities are grouped in the southern-central part of campus with the [[Autzen Stadium]] complex across the Willamette River. The university also owns and/or operates several satellite facilities, including a large facility in the White Stag Block of downtown Portland.

=== Old campus and memorial quad ===
[[File:DeadyHallWest.jpg|left|thumb|Deady Hall]]

The oldest section of campus is located in the northwest area of the current campus. The universityâs first building, [[Deady Hall]], opened on October 16, 1876, when the University had an enrollment of 177 students. It was originally known as âthe buildingâ before being named after Judge Matthew Deady in 1893. The second building on campus is known as [[Villard Hall]] and is home to the Theater Arts and Comparative Literature Departments. Completed in 1886, the hall was named after railroad magnate [[Henry Villard]], who provided financial aid to the university in 1881. Before its naming, it was known as âthe new building.â Both Deady and Villard Halls were designated [[National Historic Landmark]]s in 1977.&lt;ref name=Deady&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1260&amp;ResourceType=Building| title=National Historic Landmarks Program/ Deady &amp; Villard Halls | accessdate= 2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just south of Old Campus is the Memorial Quad, which runs north and south along Kincaid Street, capped at both ends by the main campus library, [[Knight Library]], on the south side, and the [[Lillis Business Complex]] on the north. It is flanked on the west by the tallest building on campus, [[Prince Lucien Campbell Hall]], also known as âPLC,â and the [[Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art]] on the east, which was remodeled and reopened on January 23, 2005. Also adjacent to Memorial Quad is Chapman Hall, which houses the [[Robert D. Clark Honors College]] on its third floor.
{{-}}

=== Central campus ===
[[File:JohnsonHallUO.JPG|left|thumb|Johnson Hall]]
The center of campus houses a mixture of academic buildings, an administration building, and student recreation buildings. Just to the east of Memorial Quad, facing 13th Avenue is Johnson Hall where offices for higher administration and trustee offices are found, including the offices of the University President. Directly across 13th Avenue, facing Johnson Hall is the Pioneer statue, a likeness of a bearded, buckskin-clad pioneer cast in bronze by sculptor [[Alexander Phimister Proctor]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The architecture of the University of Oregon; Outdoor Sculpture &amp; Building Ornamentation | publisher = UO Libraries | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/xpioneer.html | accessdate = 2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Proctor's &quot;Pioneer Mother&quot; statue was dedicated in the Women's Memorial Quadrangle on the other side of Johnson Hall; the two statues are aligned so that they can &quot;see&quot; one another through the large windows of the hall's main floor.

Lawrence Hall is located at the end of hardscape walkway, directly north of the intersection of 13th Avenue and University Street. It houses the School of Architecture and Allied Arts and is named after its first Dean, [[Ellis F. Lawrence]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The architecture of the University of Oregon; Lawrence Hall | publisher = UO Libraries | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/lawrence.html | accessdate = 2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen Hall, opened in 1954, is located adjacent to Lawrence Hall and houses the School of Journalism and Communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The architecture of the University of Oregon; Allen Hall | publisher = UO Libraries | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/allen.html | accessdate = 2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Erb Memorial Union is the [[student activity center|student union]], which provides many various student life amenities and sits on the southeast corner of 13th and University. It contains a food court, restaurants and cafes, a post office, student groups, meeting rooms and performance spaces, the campus radio station 88.1 [[KWVA]], and offices for administration.

South of the Erb Memorial Union across a small quad is the Student Recreational Center which is an exercise and recreation facility. It includes fitness equipment, rock climbing walls, a swimming pool, racquetball courts, an indoor elevated running track and basketball courts. Covered tennis courts and several turf fields, and outdoor tennis courts within a running track are located near the recreation center.

=== Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex and east campus ===

[[File:Willamette-Hall-UO.jpg|thumb|Willamette Hall, the centerpiece of the Lokey Science Complex]]The Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex comprises multiple science buildings to the east of Lawrence Hall, on the north side of 13th Avenue. Willamette Hall's [[Paul Olum]] Atrium is the center of the university's hard sciences complex. The construction of the $45.6 million additions of Willamette, Cascade, and Streisinger Halls to the complex was completed in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The architecture of the University of Oregon; Willamette Hall | publisher = UO Libraries | url = http://libweb.uoregon.edu/guides/architecture/oregon/willamette.html | accessdate = 2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Lokey Science Complex are two facilities focused on integrative science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isci.uoregon.edu UO Integrative Science].&lt;/ref&gt; One is the [[Lokey Laboratories]], which is a shared-use facility with state-of-the-art characterization instrumentation. Lokey Laboratories is associated with the Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI) and was dedicated to [[Lorry I. Lokey]] on February 19, 2008 for his $25 million donation toward the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Underground nanoscience laboratories dedicated

It is located underground to minimize vibrations, beneath the quad between Heustis and Deschutes Halls. The other is the [[Lewis Integrative Science Building]], which is currently under construction and is slated for completion by fall 2012.  

East campus is the primary location for residence halls on campus. However, the north edge of east campus is the future home of the Alumni Center and the new basketball arena. At the north edge adjacent to the Lokey Science Complex is Oregon Hall, which houses administrative offices including the Office of the Registrar and Office of Admissions.

Carson Hall, located near the Erb Memorial Union, provides dining services along with dormitories. Just south is the Living-Learning Center, opened in 2006. It is a collection of functions including dormitories, classrooms, study areas, dining rooms, and recreational rooms to provide a single location for many student activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://housing.uoregon.edu/construction/ |title=Living-Learning Center: LLC 2006 |publisher=Housing.uoregon.edu |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South campus ===
The center of south campus is where much of the on-campus athletic facilities reside. [[Matthew Knight Arena]], the home of the Ducks basketball team, faces Franklin Boulevard. [[Hayward Field]], home to the Ducks track and field program, sits in the eastern area of the athletic facilities. It has hosted a number of prominent track and field events such as the US Track and Field Olympic Trials, the NCAA Track and Field Championships, and [[USATF]] Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goducks.com/SportSelect.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=500&amp;KEY=&amp;SPID=243&amp;SPSID=4584 |title=Track &amp; Field - Track Town Info - GoDucks.comâThe University of Oregon Official Athletics Web Site |publisher=Goducks.com |date=1975-05-30 |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the west of the athletic facilities lies Pioneer Cemetery and further west is where the current facilities for the College of Education exists, in the southwest corner of campus. The HEDCO Education building and the Frohnmayer Music Center are in the vicinity. The Knight Law Center is located just opposite of Hayward Field in the southeast corner of campus. The Many Nations Longhouse and the Museum of Natural and Cultural History are East of Knight Law.

=== Other areas and satellites ===
The controversial&lt;ref&gt;Pittman, Alan (14 January 2010). [http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2010/01/14/coverstory.html &quot;Park or parking lot?&quot;] ''Eugene Weekly''.&lt;/ref&gt; Riverfront Research Park is a small facility maintained by the university, located across Franklin Boulevard from the main campus, next to the Willamette River. The park is used for creating new technologies, such as research about artificial intelligence at the Computational Intelligence Research Lab, and it is the home of the [[Zebrafish Information Network]] (ZFIN), the [[zebrafish]] [[model organism]] database. Local controversy has existed since before the development and approval of the site master plan by the City of Eugene in 1989. Controversy stems from the lack of citizen involvement in the planning process for the use of public lands, and the potential for multi-story office buildings and parking lots to replace open space, civic space, and wildlife habitat along the Willamette River. The University and Student Senates have each passed resolutions {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} against construction on the banks of the Willamette River under the current development plan, yet plans for development persist. In March 2010, the issue of a conditional use permit extension for the Research Park was appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals by a group of citizens, students, and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectingeugene.org |title=Connecting Eugene |publisher=Connecting Eugene |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex for the Ducks football and baseball team is located north across the Willamette River. It includes the football stadium ([[Autzen Stadium]]),the baseball park ([[PK Park]]), an indoor practice football field (Moshofsky Center), an outdoor practice field (Kilkenny Field), and the Casanova Center which includes offices, the athletics Hall of Fame, locker rooms, weight rooms, a film review theater, and a treatment center.

The university also leases space in Old Town Portland in the White Stag Block. UO-Portland provides an urban study environment for the School of Architecture and Allied Arts, the School of Journalism and Communication, the School of Law, and the Lundquist College of Business.  Additionally, the Division of Continuing Education, the Labor Education Resource Center, and the Department of Athletics have active offices there.  The [[University of Oregon Bookstore|Duck Store]] has an outlet in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=University of Oregon |url=http://pdx.uoregon.edu/ |title=UO Portland |publisher=Pdx.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}
The University of Oregon received a grade of &quot;B&quot; from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/university-of-oregon-eugene College Sustainability Report Card 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The undergraduate architecture program is consistently ranked among the highest in the country, and is currently ranked as the #1 public program for &quot;Sustainable Design Practice and Principles&quot; by DesignIntelligence magazine.

There has also been a push for sustainable buildings on campus with a development plan that requires any new building or renovation to incorporate sustainable design.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Therese. [http://www.oregon.gov/ENERGY/CONS/BUS/docs/UofO.pdf &quot;When University of Oregon says energy conservation, it means business&quot;] (PDF). Oregon Department of Energy Pull-out.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lillis Business Complex]] was the catalyst for the policy. The building, completed in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcb.uoregon.edu/news/news.php?issue=050105&amp;story=leed |title=LCB News |publisher=Lcb.uoregon.edu |date=2009-10-31 |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; has earned a LEED Silver rating, the highest rating of any college business building in the United States.

The [[Green Product Design Network]] (GPDN) was created by a group of leaders from the UO with expertise in [[green chemistry]], product design, business and journalism and communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainability.uoregon.edu Sustainable Oregon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libraries and museums==

* The Washburn Gallery in the FAS Ceramics building.

==Oregon Bach Festival==
The UO is the home of the [[Oregon Bach Festival]], a donor-supported program of the University and the only major music festival affiliated with an American university. Founded in 1970 by German conductor [[Helmuth Rilling]] and UO professor (and past president of the [[American Choral Directors Association]]) Royce Saltzman, the festival has grown into an international program that draws hundreds of musicians and over 40,000 attendees annually.  The festival's focus is choral and orchestral music, and it hosts a professional choir and orchestra each year to perform major works by [[Bach]] and other composers; it also sponsors a master class in conducting that draws participants from around the world.

The festival has presented such artists as [[Frederica von Stade]], [[Bobby McFerrin]], [[Garrison Keillor]], and [[Thomas Quasthoff]], who made his American debut in Eugene in 1995.  The festival actively commissions and premieres new choral-orchestra works, including pieces by [[Arvo PÃ¤rt]], [[Osvaldo Golijov]], and [[Tan Dun]].  A Bach Festival recording of the world-premiere performance of [[Krzyztof Penderecki]]'s ''Credo'' won the 2001 [[Grammy Award]] for best choral performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.thedailystar.com/news/stories/2001/02/22/grammy.html |title=The Daily Star - Online Edition |publisher=Old.thedailystar.com |date=2001-02-22 |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Forensics====
In addition to its athletic teams, the university also has a competitive intercollegiate [[Individual Events|Speech]] and [[Debate]] team. The University of Oregon Forensics program was founded in 1876, at the same time as the university. Initially the program consisted of two student-formed forensic societies, which developed into &quot;doughnut league&quot; inter-dorm competitions in the 1890s. In 1891, the UO began intercollegiate competition. Forensics continued to grow as a staple of the university's community and by 1911, the team was so successful that it began charging admission to debates. Money raised during these events was often donated to the fledgling University of Oregon football program.

[[NPDA|Parliamentary debate]] was integrated into UO Forensics in 1998-99 and the team has been competitive since. In 2001, the UO's Alan Tauber and Heidi Ford claimed a national title, winning the first ever [[National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence]] (NPTE). As of 2007, the team is coached by Aaron Donaldson, who debated for [[Carroll College (Montana)|Carroll College]] 1999-2003, and Luke Landry, who won the 2007 NPTE while debating for [[William Jewell College]]. In the 2006-2007 season, the team won first place in the Northwest Forensics Conference's overall sweepstakes, due to regularly strong showings in both individual events and parliamentary debate.

====Student government====
[[File:Asuo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO)|ASUO]] Window Sign, EMU Suite 4]]
The [[Associated Students of the University of Oregon (ASUO)]] is the [[student government]] at the University of Oregon.  It is a non-profit organization funded by the University of Oregon. Its purpose is to provide for the [[social]], [[cultural]], [[education]]al and [[Human body|physical]] development of its members, and for the advancement of their individual and collective interests both within and without the University. The ASUO is the [[student government]] and is run by students for students and works on [[University of Oregon campus|campus]], [[Eugene, Oregon|city]], [[Oregon|state]], and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]]-level [[political campaign|campaign]]s. Membership consists of all students at the University of Oregon, [[Eugene, Oregon]], who have paid the current term or [[semester]] student incidental fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;info&quot;&gt;[http://asuo.uoregon.edu/about.php ASUO About Page], Associated Students of the University of Oregon website, University of Oregon.&lt;/ref&gt;

====EMU Board of Directors====
The [[Erb Memorial Union]] [[Board of Directors]] is responsible for making general policy decisions and long-range plans for the operation of the EMU. The board allocates the EMU's multi-million dollar [[budget]], assigns space for student groups and advises staff in the [[management]] of the EMU. The sixteen-member [[Board of Directors|Board]] consists of twelve students (seven elected in a campus-wide election and five direct appointments from either EMU programs or the ASUO), three faculty members appointed by the University of Oregon President and one EMU staff member elected by their peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMUBoardinfo&quot;&gt;[http://emu.uoregon.edu/ EMU Board Page], Erb Memorial Union website, University of Oregon.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every fiscal year, the EMU Board prepares a benchmark increase to the ASUO Senate for approval.  After the benchmark process, the EMU presents its final budget to the Senate, requesting a decrease, increase, or no change in Incidental Fees to be allocated to the EMU.  If the budget request is approved, the budget must be signed by the ASUO President and then the UO President.  Unlike the budget process, any general policy decisions by the EMU Board do not require Senate oversight or approval.

==Athletics==

[[File:Jaqua Center.jpg|thumb|right|John E. Jaqua Center for Student Athletes]]
The University of Oregon is a member of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]] and the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Football Bowl Subdivision of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. The athletic programs have garnered 14 NCAA team championships,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/champs_listing1.html Schools with the Most NCAA Championships]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 60 NCAA individual champions in various track and field events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportshistory.uoregon.edu/details/show/6 |title=Leadership and Legacy - Athletics and the University of Oregon &amp;#124; Topics |publisher=Sportshistory.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two primary rivals of the [[Oregon Ducks football]] team are the [[Washington Huskies]] and the [[Oregon State Beavers]]. The football rivalry with [[Oregon State University]], known as the &quot;[[Civil War (college football game)|Civil War]]&quot;, is one of the nation's oldest. Every year, the two teams face off in the last game of the regular season. The two teams have faced each other nearly every year since 1894 with the exception of five years. Games were not held in 1900, 1901, 1911, 1943, and 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;UpCloseAndPersonal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osualum.com/s/359/index.aspx?sid=359&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=454 |title=OSU Alumni Association - Greatest Civil War |publisher=Osualum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university competes in 14 sports: football, menâs and womenâs basketball, cross country, track and field, baseball, softball, menâs and womenâs tennis, menâs and womenâs golf, womenâs soccer, womenâs lacrosse, womenâs volleyball, and acrobatics &amp; tumbling. This does not include club sports which competes at the Division I level in Rugby, Soccer, Rowing, and Waterpolo. As well as women's Division I club athletics in Rowing, Rugby, and Waterpolo.

[[File:OregonDucks.svg|right|thumb|175px|''UO Athletics Logo'']]With 12 NCAA championships between them, cross country and track and field are the two programs at the university that have enjoyed the most success. The programs have produced many world-class athletes including [[Steve Prefontaine]] and [[Alberto Salazar]]. [[Nike, Inc|Nike]] had been formed by the former track and field head coach [[Bill Bowerman]] and former University of Oregon track runner [[Phil Knight]]. The successes of the programs have given the name of Track Town, USA to Eugene.

Created in 1893, the football team played its first game in 1894 and won its first [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] in 1917 against the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The 1938-39 men's basketball team, nicknamed the âTall Firs,â won the first-ever NCAA basketball tournament by defeating [[Ohio State]] in the March 28, 1939 championship game.&lt;ref name=&quot;UOAthTimeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportshistory.uoregon.edu/timeline |title=Leadership and Legacy - Athletics and the University of Oregon &amp;#124; Timeline |publisher=Sportshistory.uoregon.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally recognized as an official sport at the university in 1908, baseball was disbanded in 1981 due to concerns with [[Title IX]]. In 2007, the athletic director [[Patrick Kilkenny]] announced plans to reinstate baseball and to drop wrestling while adding womenâs acrobatics &amp; tumbling.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===Mascot===
{{Main|The Oregon Duck}}
The mascot of the University of Oregon is the fighting duck. The popular [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] character [[Donald Duck]] has been the mascot for decades, thanks to a handshake agreement made between then-Athletic Director [[Leo Harris]] and [[Walt Disney]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;MascotHistory&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=28746&amp;SPID=252&amp;DB_OEM_ID=500&amp;ATCLID=153778 |title=The Duck - GoDucks.comâThe University of Oregon Official Athletics Web Site |publisher=Goducks.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mascot has been challenged more than a few times in its lifetime. The first came in 1966 when Walt Disney died and the company realized there was no formal contract written for the use of Donaldâs image. A formal contract was written up in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;MascotHistory&quot;/&gt; Potential heirs &quot;Mallard Drake&quot; and &quot;Mandrake&quot; challenged Donaldâs position in 1978 and 2003 respectively,&lt;ref name=&quot;MascotHistory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.dailyemerald.com/media/storage/paper859/news/2002/11/15/News/One-Duck.or.Two.part.1-1978791.shtml|title=One duck...or two?|last=Schmidt|first=Brad|date=November 15, 2002|accessdate=2008-02-26|work=Oregon Daily Emerald}}&lt;/ref&gt; but both were unpopular and discontinued.

===Song===
{{Main|Mighty Oregon}}
The [[fight song]] is &quot;[[Mighty Oregon]]&quot;, written by student Albert Perfect and professor John DeWitt Gilbert in 1916. It has undergone several changes since its original performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyemerald.com/2.2358/mighty-oregon-sings-of-the-past-1.201089|title='Mighty Oregon' sings of the past|last=Neuman|first=Steven|date=November 12, 2006|accessdate=2009-11-09|work=Oregon Daily Emerald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction and popular culture==
===Onscreen===
The film ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' (1978) was filmed on the university campus and the surrounding area. The building used as the exterior of the Delta House (which belonged to the University of Oregon [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] chapter) was demolished in 1986, but the interior scenes were shot in the [[Sigma Nu]] house, which still stands today. The Omega house belongs to the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity and still stands today. The sorority house where Bluto climbs the ladder to peek in on the coeds was actually the exterior of the Sigma Nu fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libweb.uoregon.edu/speccoll/archives/ &quot;University archives&quot;]. UO Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; Other buildings that were used during filming include Johnson Hall, Gerlinger Hall, Fenton Hall, Carson Hall, and the Erb Memorial Union (EMU). The EMU dining facility known as &quot;The Fishbowl&quot; was the site of the famous food-fight scene. The [[Knight Library]] and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art can also be seen in the movie.&lt;ref name=&quot;film_sites&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acmewebpages.com/animal/locales.htm |title= ACME Animal House Film Locations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
