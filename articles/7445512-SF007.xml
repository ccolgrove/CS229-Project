'''Trinity Rescue Kit''' (also known as TRK) is a free [[command-line]] [[Live CD]] [[Linux distribution]] created especially for rescuing Windows PCs&lt;ref name=schof&gt;[[jack.schofield]]: [[The Guardian]] ''Technology: Ask Jack...Endless reboot'', 28th June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=PN052&gt;Podnutz ''[http://www.podnutz.com/podnutz052?page=1 Episode 52: Trinity Rescue Kit]''&lt;/ref&gt; It is aimed specifically at offline operations for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and Linux systems such as rescue, repair, password resets and [[disk cloning]]. It's [[virusscan]] encompases five [[antivirus programs]].&lt;ref&gt; Alison Diana ''Trinity Upgrades Linux Rescue Kit'' [[InformationWeek]] 17 August 2010 11:09 AM&lt;/ref&gt;  

Trinity Rescue Kit is bootable from a CD, USB media or a network using [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]]. Documentation for TRK exists both on the website, as well as in the console by using the command &quot;trkhelp -l -t&quot;. Trinity Rescue Kit omits the standard Linux [[Manual page (Unix)|manual command]] in order to conserve space. In addition, there are tools to migrate TRK from an [[ISO image]] to a bootable USB device and vice versa.

Trinity Rescue Kit has a graphical startup menu based on [[SYSLINUX]] and vesamenu32 which is used to select boot options, but the OS is otherwise [[command-line]] only.

==History==
Starting in 2001, after creating a bootable DOS-based CD of proprietary software for offline operations (named &quot;The Vault&quot;), Belgian developer, Tom Kerremans decided to create a free bootable Linux CD.&lt;ref name=PN052&gt;Podnutz ''[http://www.podnutz.com/podnutz052?page=1 Episode 52: Trinity Rescue Kit]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

The purpose would be to include free tools that could help rescue a Windows installation that was being problematic. Binaries and scripts from other distributions inspired the Trinity Rescue Kit. Sources included [[Mandriva]] 2005 and the [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]] Cores 3 and 4. The startup procedure and methods, and many scripts, are custom-made for Trinity Rescue Kit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trinityhome.org/Home/index.php?wpid=1&amp;front_id=12 What is Trinity Rescue Kit?]&lt;/ref&gt;
