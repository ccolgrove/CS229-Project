'''WJPX''' is a full-power television station in San Juan, Puerto Rico transmitting over analog channel 24, digital 21. It is currently an [[owned-and-operated station]] of the [[Caribevision]] network.

The station was founded in 1987 and was a 24 hour news station branded as ''WSJN 24 Horas, El Canal de Noticias''. Some famous Puerto Rican television reporters started their careers at WSJN, such as [[Maria Celeste Arraras]], Ada Torres Toro, [[Sol Sostre]], Lyanne Melendez, [[Edna Schmidt]] and Roberto Cortes.

WJPX was later owned by [[LIN TV]], which branded the station [[MTV]].  At that time, the station broadcast MTV programs (both locally-produced and imported from the main MTV network), videos and horse races.  The MTV branding and programming were licensed from [[Viacom]], which, incidentally, once owned two of WJPX's then-sister stations: [[WWHO]] in Columbus, Ohio and [[WNDY-TV]] in Indianapolis, before those stations were sold to LIN in 2005.

On October 19, 2006 LIN TV announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell WJPX along with sister station WAPA-TV to [[InterMedia Partners]] for $130 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.corporate-ir.net/ireye/ir_site.zhtml?ticker=TVL&amp;script=410&amp;layout=-6&amp;item_id=918570| title=LIN TV to Sell Puerto Rico Operations| accessdate=2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was completed on March 30, 2007.

[[InterMedia Partners]] then sold the station again to Caribevision Station Group. The sale was completed in October 2007.

From March 19, 2009 the subchannel digital 24.2 began transnmiting Camarero Racetrack.
