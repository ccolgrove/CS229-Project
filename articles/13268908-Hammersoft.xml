'''Norman Connors''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/norman-connors-p66055 |title=All Music - Norman Connors Bio |publisher=All Music |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[jazz]] drummer, composer, arranger, producer, and headliner, who has led some influential jazz and R&amp;B groups. He also achieved several big R&amp;B hits of the day, especially with love ballads.

==Biography==
Connors became interested in jazz as a child when he began to play drums, once sitting in for [[Elvin Jones]] at a [[John Coltrane]] performance he attended while in [[middle school]]. Connors studied music at [[Temple University]] and [[Juilliard]].

His first recording was on [[Archie Shepp]]'s 1967 release, ''Magic of JuJu''. He played with [[Pharaoh Sanders]] for the next few years until signing with [[Cobblestone Records]] in 1972 and releasing his first record as a bandleader. He went on to front some great jazz recordings with [[Carlos Garnett]], [[Gary Bartz]], [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] and [[Herbie Hancock]] such as &quot;Love From the Sun&quot; on Buddah records..

Connors began to focus more on [[R&amp;B]] material in the mid 1970s after signing with Buddah Records. He scored several US hits with songs featuring guest vocalists such as [[Michael Henderson]], [[Jean Carn]], and [[Phyllis Hyman]]. The most successful of these was &quot;You Are My Starship&quot; (#4 R&amp;B, #27 Pop), featuring Henderson in 1976, while &quot;Valentine Love&quot;, his first chart success, made #10 R&amp;B in 1975, with vocals from Henderson and Jean Carn. [[Dee Dee Bridgewater]] also performed with him on the jazz album &quot;Love from the Sun&quot;. He has also produced recordings for various artists, including collaborators like Jean Carn, Phyllis Hyman, [[Al Johnson]], [[Norman Brown]], and saxophonist [[Marion Meadows]].

Connors' crossover to the disco scene was in 1980 when he had the hit 'Take it to the Limit' recorded on [[Arista Records]] which was released on 12&quot; single.  The B side called 'Black Cow' (an instrumental) was written by [[Steely Dan]]'s [[Walter Becker]] and [[Donald Fagen]].

His recent work, &quot;Star Power&quot;, has seen him operating more in the vein of [[smooth jazz]] and urban crossover music, featuring [[Howard Hewett]], [[Bobby Lyle]], [[Ray Parker, Jr.]], [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Michael Henderson]], and [[Antoinette]].

==Trivia==
Lived in the same [[Philadelphia]] neighborhood as comedian [[Bill Cosby]] as a child.
