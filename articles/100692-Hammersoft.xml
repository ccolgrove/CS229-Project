Washington attended grammar school at [[Pennington-Grimes Elementary School]] in Mount Vernon until 1968. When he was 14, his parents' marriage fell apart and his mother sent him to a private preparatory school, [[Oakland Military Academy]], in New Windsor, New York State. &quot;That decision changed my life,&quot; Washington later said, &quot;because I wouldnât have survived in the direction I was going. The guys I was hanging out with at the time, my running buddies, have now done maybe 40 years combined in the penitentiary. They were nice guys, but the streets got them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Denzel Washington: 'I Try To Send A Good Message' | publisher = Parade Magazine | date = December 12, 1999 | url = http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/1999/edition_12-12-1999/Denzel_Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Oakland, Washington next attended [[Mainland High School]], a public high school in Daytona Beach, Florida, from 1970â71.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;/&gt; Washington was interested in attending [[Texas Tech University]]: &quot;I grew up in the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys Club]] in Mount Vernon, and we were the Red Raiders.

In 2006, Denzel worked alongside multi-talented Irish off-rock band The Script on their new project combining music and Hollywood. The hybrid of genres was critically acclaimed but didn't receive much mainstream attention due to a legal conflicts between The Script's record label and Denzel's studio commitments.
