==Information==
The talented player from the southern city of [[Najaf]], is one of Iraqâs most gifted individuals, who excelled playing for the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] team in the qualifying rounds â his performances compensated for the absence of [[Nashat Akram]] in Iraqâs midfield. Before the war, he was named one of the two best players in the 2003-2004 season by an Iraqi FA panel and became a regular in Stangeâs Olympic squad making his debut in the 2-1 defeat to Qatar in the former Oman and Perth Glory coachâs first game in charge of Iraq. Saleh Sadeer was one of [[Bernd Stange]]âs favourite players when the German first arrived in [[Iraq]]. He scored an important goal in the 1-1 draw with [[Vietnam]] in [[Hanoi]] that helped Iraq to progress to the second round. He started his playing career with Shaâabiya team Nasour Al-Jumhuriya before joining [[Al-Najaf]] where he progressed through the youth ranks under coach Zuhair Khadim. In [[1999]], he was promoted into the first team by Najih Hemoud and became a regular. Under coach Hemoud, Al-Najaf became one of Iraqâs most entertaining teams with Saleh Sadeer â and captain [[Falah Hassan]], Abbas Wahoudi, Saeed Muhsin, Ali Hashim and Qasim Jalout. In 2003 after the war, he moved to Talaba where he made several outstanding performances in the [[Arab Champions League]] â which earned him a move to Egyptian giants Zamalek for next season. After playing one season with [[Al Zamalek]], he joined Lebanon league champions [[Al-Ansar FC|Al-Ansar]] where he helped them to two consecutive Lebanon league titles.
