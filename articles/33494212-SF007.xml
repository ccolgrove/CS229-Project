'''''This Is My Next''''' was a technology news [[blog]] founded by [[Joshua Topolsky]], [[Nilay Patel]], and Paul Miller in April 2011. On average the website posted between 3 and 5 articles a day and attracted 1 million unique visitors and 3.4 million page views&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edelman.com/speak_up/blog/archives/2011/08/the_verge_is_co.html Richard Edelman - 6 A.M.: The Verge Is Coming]&lt;/ref&gt;. As of August 23, 2011, the website was ranked at number 22 on [[Techmeme]]'s leaderboard placing it ahead of popular technology websites like [[Gizmodo]] and [[Mashable]]. The website was included in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s &quot;Best Blogs of 2011&quot; list. In a review, ''Time'''s [[Harry McCracken]] said of the site &quot;It may be temporary, but it's also exemplary, with everything from meaty reviews to smart analysis of tech-related lawsuits to a fun weekly podcast&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2075431_2075447_2075480,00.html This Is My Next - The Best Blogs of 2011 - TIME]&lt;/ref&gt;. Though it was rumored that ''This Is My Next'' may have continued to function after ''The Verge'' launched, Topolsky later confirmed that ''This Is My Next'' would end its run when the ''The Verge'' launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vremixed.com/2011/07/in-brief-this-is-my-next-not-disappearing-into-oblivion/ VRemixed / In Brief: This Is My Next â Not Disappearing Into Oblivion]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisismynext.com/2011/07/22/podcast-016-07-21-2011/ This is my next Podcast 016 â 07.22.2011 | This is my next]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/status/130110413521170432]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''This Is My Next'' was created as an interim website for Topolsky, Patel, and Miller's former [[Engadget]] podcast while their new technology networkânow known as ''[[The Verge]]''âwas in development. The site first launched with the domain thisismynextpodcast.com but soon became thisismynext.com when it was decided that the website should function as an interim technology blog&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thisismynext.com/2011/04/14/this-is-my-next/ |title=This is my nextâ¦ &amp;#124; This is my next |publisher=This is my next... |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The website also included articles from former ''Engadget'' staffers Joanna Stern, Ross Miller, Chris Ziegler, Chad Mumm, Justin Glow, Dan Chilton, Thomas Ricker, and Vlad Savov. The website was non-commercial and ran with minimal advertisements.

On November 1, 2011, ''This Is My Next'' effectively ended and now redirects to ''The Verge'', which was populated with all its content. The &quot;This is my next&quot; branding will be used for a new special feature on ''The Verge''.

==Podcast==
The ''This Is My Next Podcast'' entered in at number 13 when it debuted on the iTunes podcast chart on April 8, 2011, making it the number one technology podcast&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itunescharts.net/us/charts/podcasts/2011/04/08 This Is My Next], April 2011, Itunes.net. Retrieved July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.

The podcast was fairly light in tone, with show hosts Topolsky, Patel, and Miller regularly falling off topic and discussing popular culture. Guests, usually from the editorial team, often appeared in the podcast and make contributions in their particular areas of expertise.

Episode 019, the first ever video podcast, was live-streamed on the August 11, 2011. This edition of the podcast didn't just include usual presenters, but featured the rest of the team as well. The broadcast suffered from a host of technical issues which led to the curtailment of any further filmed broadcasts until the launch of ''The Verge'' in the autumn of 2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisismynext.com/2011/08/12/podcast-019-08-12-2011/ This is my next Podcast 019 â 08.12.2011 | This is my next]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Fans of the podcast developed novelty websites like [http://thisismynextbingo.com thisismynextbingo.com] and [http://thisismynextbingolesson.com thisismynextbingolesson.com]. Others have created free apps for the podcast, in the [[iTunes Store]] and the [[Android Market]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://itunes.apple.com/app/this-is-my-next-bingo/id441032430?mt=8 This Is My Next Bingo for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad on the iTunes App Store]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bic.bingo This is my next bingo - Android Market]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The podcast usually featured intro and outro [[chiptune]] versions of well known songs. As of episode 22, published on September 3rd 2011, the team began to feature artists signed to lesser known independent record labels with music being generally more sombre in tone. Artists to date have included [[Luke Vibert]], [[Uwe Schmidt]], [[London Elektricity]], [[TÅwa Tei]], and [[Ceephax Acid Crew]].

==Notable coverage==
On April 22, 2011, ''This Is My Next'' released mockups based on rumors of a possible next-generation [[iPhone]]. The mockups were widely reported on many other news websites&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/04/22/iphone-5-to-have-3-7-inch-screen-bigger-home-button-and-ipod-style-body/ iPhone 5 to Have 3.7-inch Screen, Bigger Home Button and iPod Style Body? - TNW Apple]&lt;/ref&gt;.
