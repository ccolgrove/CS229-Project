The '''30th New Brunswick general election''' was held on October 12, 1982, to elect 58 members to the [[50th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]], the governing house of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]. It saw [[Richard Hatfield]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservative Party]] win its largest majority ever to that time. ([[Bernard Lord]] beat this record in [[New Brunswick general election, 1999|1999]].)

The [[parliamentary opposition|Opposition]] [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal Party]] had changed leaders four times since the eve of [[New Brunswick general election, 1978|the 1978 election]]. It chose [[Doug Young (politician)|Doug Young]] just months before the vote in a divisive contest that came down to a final ballot against [[Joseph A. Day]].

The PCs ran two separate campaigns - one in [[English language|English]] and one in [[French language|French]]. The francophone campaign, which was mostly run by Hatfield's French lieutenant [[Jean-Maurice Simard]], began with the '''Grand Ralliement''', a symposium on language rights which took place in [[Shippagan, New Brunswick|Shippagan]] ten days before the election call. Over 400 notable [[Acadians]] and other francophones attended. The dual campaigns were remarkably separate from each other, and in some cases contradictory: the English campaign revolved around attacking Doug Young's economic record, while the French campaign pointed out Hatfield's role working with Liberal Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] in enshrining francophone rights in the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

The Liberals, divided by their recent leadership contest, ran a lackluster campaign which allowed Hatfield's and Simard's overtures to the [[Acadian]] population to carry many seats that had been Liberal strongholds for generations, including 10 of 21 Acadian ridings. The [[Parti Acadien]] made its last appearance, as the Conservatives adopted several key points of their former platform.

The [[New Democratic Party of New Brunswick]] elected [[Bob Hall (New Brunswick politician)|Bob Hall]] as its first ever [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|Member of the Legislative Assembly]]. He was later joined by a second NDP MLA, [[Peter Trites]], in a by-election.
