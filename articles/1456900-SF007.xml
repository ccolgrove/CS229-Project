'''FlexNet Publisher''' (formerly known as FLEXlm) is a common software [[license manager]] from [[Flexera Software]] which implements[[copy protection| license management]] and is intended to be used in corporate environments to provide [[Floating_licensing|floating license]]s to multiple end users of computer software.

Computer software can be licensed in a variety of ways. A license to use a piece of software may be associated with a specific machine (''node-locked''), permitting it to only run on that machine (node in a [[Computer network|network]]); alternatively, a company may buy a pool of ''floating'' licenses and these licenses may be allocated dynamically to machines, a license being ''checked-out'' when a user begins using the software on any given machine and ''checked-in'' when the user finishes using the software. In this way, for example, a company might buy a pool of 50 licenses but support a user community of hundreds of occasional users of the software (so long as no more than 50 users ever want to use the software simultaneously).

==History==

FLEXlm was originally a joint development by GLOBEtrotter Software and Highland Software in 1988. Highland's rights to the FLEXlm product were acquired by GLOBEtrotter in 1994; Highland continued as a reseller of 3rd party software. GLOBEtrotter was then acquired by [[Macrovision]] in 2000. Combining features from the [[Safecast]] protection system and FLEXlm, FlexNet featured [[product activation]] and executable wrapping, supporting [[floating licensing]] and node locked licensing models. Macrovision subsequently renamed FLEXlm to FLEXnet Publisher.

The original FLEXlm development team moved on to develop the Reprise License Manager (RLM) at [http://www.reprisesoftware.com/ Reprise Software] in 2006.

On the 1st of April 2008 Macrovision's Software Business Unit, which included FLEXnet Publisher, was sold to the private equity company [[Thoma Cressey Bravo]] and subsequently relaunched as Acresso Software. It was a cash transaction valued at approximately $200 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flexerasoftware.com/company/newscenter/pressreleases/press-releases_8572.htm Acresso Software Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 Acresso Software announced its name change to Flexera Software and FLEXnet Publisher was changed to FlexNet Publisher. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9139211/Acresso_who_Macrovision_spinoff_changes_name_again?taxonomyId=1 Acresso who? Macrovision spinoff changes name, again (Computerworld article)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 it's announced that Teachers' Private Capital, the private investment department of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Flexera Software from Thoma Bravo, LLC, a private equity firm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/teachers-private-capital-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-flexera-software-1539798.htm Teachers' Private Capital to Acquire Majority Stake in Flexera Software]&lt;/ref&gt;

The product is currently marketed by Flexera Software as FlexNet Publisher.

==Issues with Bootloaders==
Due to the way the DRM works, FlexNet Publisher is incompatible with [[TrueCrypt]] products&lt;ref&gt;http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/403/kb403210.html&lt;/ref&gt; and can make [[Linux]]-based systems unable to boot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~cjwatson/blosxom/debian/2010-08-28-windows-applications-making-grub2-unbootable.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/441941&lt;/ref&gt;
