&quot;'''When I Looked at Him'''&quot; is a 1989 song by the [[pop music|pop]]-[[freestyle music|freestyle]] [[girl group]] [[ExposÃ© (band)|ExposÃ©]]. It was written and produced by the group's founder, [[Lewis MartineÃ©]], and it appears on their second album ''[[What You Don't Know (ExposÃ© album)|What You Don't Know]]''. Lead vocals on the track were sung by [[Jeanette Jurado]]. 

The song is a pensive ballad closer in form and structure to the group's #1 pop hit &quot;[[Seasons Change]]&quot; than to many of their more dance-oriented songs. Still, an extended &quot;Suave Mix&quot; appeared on the CD version of ''What You Don't Know'', and an acoustic version of this mix was included as the B-side to the single.
