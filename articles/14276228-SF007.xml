It was the most popular Linux distribution in [[Brazil]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} After almost ending the project, due to many complaints from users in his forums and technical problems, mostly caused by the fact that Kurumin was based on Debian unstable, which is not targeted to non-experienced users, and was the majority of Kurumin users. Now Kurumin is based in Kubuntu, and Leandro Santos, the developer of Kalango Linux (another distro based in Kurumin) joined efforts with Morimoto to develop the new version of Kurumin.

He is also the author of several books about hardware and software, especially Linux, all published in [[Brazil]], his home country. He sells books and Linux CDs. Much (if not all) of his work is free content.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}
