The '''1967â68 Houston Cougars men's basketball team''' represented the [[University of Houston]] in the 1967â68 NCAA University Division men's basketball season.  The team played its home games at [[Delmar Fieldhouse]] in [[Houston]] for the second consecutive season.  This season marked the team's ninth year as an [[NCAA Division I independent schools (basketball)|independent]] member of the NCAA's University Division.  Houston was led by twelfth-year head coach [[Guy Lewis]].  

During the regular season, the [[Elvin Hayes]]-fronted Cougars team would beat the [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]]-led [[1967â68 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team|UCLA Bruins]] on January 20, 1968, in what was known as the [[Game of the Century (college basketball)|Game of the Century]].  Houston obtained a perfect 28â0 record for regular season play, and eventually finished with a 31â2 overall record.  It was the first time in the program's history that at least 30 wins were achieved.  The team finished as number one in both the [[AP Poll]] and the [[Coaches' Poll]].  The team was invited to the [[1968 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1968 NCAA Men's University Division Basketball Tournament]], and finished as a semifinalist.  It was the second [[Final four|Final Four]] appearance in Houston's history.

Following the season, Elvin Hayes was drafted into the [[National Basketball Association]] by the [[Houston Rockets|San Diego Rockets]] as the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall draft pick]] in the [[1968 NBA Draft]].  [[Don Chaney]] was also taken as the twelfth overall draft pick by the [[Boston Celtics]].
