[[Image:Protect Your Republic Protest - 1 (2007-04-14).jpg|300px|thumb|[[Republic Protests]] took place in 2007 in support of the [[Kemalist ideology|Kemalist reforms]], particularly [[Secular state|state secularism]] and [[democracy]].]]
{{Politics of Turkey}}
'''Secularism in Turkey''' defines the relationship between [[religion]] and [[state (polity)|state]] in the country of [[Turkey]]. [[Secularism]] (or [[laicity]]) was first introduced with the 1928 amendment of the [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|Constitution of 1924]], which removed the provision declaring that the &quot;Religion of the State is Islam&quot;, and with the later [[AtatÃ¼rk's Reforms|reforms of AtatÃ¼rk]], which set the administrative and political requirements to create a [[modern]], [[democracy|democratic]], [[secular state]], aligned with [[Kemalist ideology]].

Nine years after its introduction, [[laÃ¯citÃ©]] was explicitly stated in the second article of the then Turkish constitution on February 5, 1937. The current [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution of 1982]] neither recognizes an [[official religion]] nor promotes any. This includes Islam, to which at least nominally more than 99% of its citizens subscribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Turkey | work = The World Factbook | publisher = Central Intelligence Agency (US) | date = 2008-07-24 | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tu.html | accessdate = 2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey's &quot;laÃ¯citÃ©&quot; does not call for a strict [[separation of church and state|separation of religion and the state]], but describes the state's stance as one of &quot;active neutrality.&quot; Turkey's actions related with religion are carefully analyzed and evaluated through the [[Diyanet Ä°Åleri BaÅkanlÄ±ÄÄ±]] (English: Presidency of Religious Affairs). The duties of the Presidency of Religious Affairs are &quot;to execute the works concerning the beliefs, worship, and ethics of Islam, enlighten the public about their religion, and administer the sacred worshipping places&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diyanet.gov.tr/english/tanitim.asp?id=13 Basic Principles, Aims And Objectives], [[Presidency of Religious Affairs]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of secularism in Turkey extends to the [[Tanzimat]] reforms of Ottoman Empire. The second peak in secularism occurred during the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era]]. The current form was achieved by [[AtatÃ¼rk's Reforms]].

===Ottoman Empire===
{{See also|Ottoman Caliphate|Religion in the Ottoman Empire}}
The establishing structure ([[Ruling institution of the Ottoman Empire]]) of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (13th century) was an Islamic state in which the head of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] state was the Sultan.  The social system was organized around [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]. Millet structure allowed a great degree of religious, cultural and ethnic continuity to non-Muslim populations across the [[subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire]] and at the same time it permitted their incorporation into the Ottoman administrative, economic and political system.&lt;ref name=&quot;sec&quot;&gt;[http://www.secularisminturkey.net/docs/Secular-Transcript.pdf Secularism: The Turkish Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman-appointed governor collected taxes and provided security, while the local religious or cultural matters were left to the regional communities to decide. On the other hand, the sultans were Muslims and the laws that bound them were based on the [[Sharia]], the body of [[Islam]]ic law, as well as various cultural customs. The Sultan, beginning in 1516, was also a [[Caliph]], the leader of all the [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]] in the world. By the turn of the 19th century the Ottoman ruling elite recognized the need to restructure the legislative, military and judiciary systems to cope with their new political rivals in Europe. When the millet system started to lose its efficiency due to the [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|rise of nationalism within its borders]], the Ottoman Empire explored new ways of governing its territory composed of diverse populations.

Sultan [[Selim III]] founded the first secular military schools by establishing the new military unit, [[Nizam-Ä± Cedid]], as early as 1792. However the last century (19th century) of the Ottoman Empire had many far reaching reforms. These reforms peaked with the [[tanzimat]] which was the initial reform era of the Ottoman empire. After the tanzimat, rules, such as those relating to the equalized [[Dhimmi|status of non-Muslim citizens]], the establishment of [[Ottoman parliament|a parliament]], the abandonment of medieval punishments for apostasy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf Hussain, Ishtiaq. ''The Tanzimat: Secular Reforms in the Ottoman Empire'', Faith Matters, October 7, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the codification of the constitution of the empire and the rights of ottoman subjects were established. The [[First World War]] brought about the [[fall of the Ottoman Empire]] and the subsequent [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] by the victorious Allies. Therefore, the [[Republic of Turkey]] was actually a nation-state built as a result of an empire lost.

===Reforms of Republic===
{{Main|AtatÃ¼rk's Reforms}}
During the establishment of the Republic, there were two sections of the elite group at the helm of the discussions for the future. These were the Islamist reformists and Westerners.&lt;ref name=&quot;sec&quot;/&gt; They shared a similar goal, the modernization of the new state. Many basic goals were common to both groups. The founder of the modern Turkish Republic [[Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]]'s achievement was to amplify this common ground and put the country on a fast track of reforms, now known as [[AtatÃ¼rk's Reforms]].

Their first act was to give the Turkish nation the right to exercise [[popular sovereignty]] via [[representative democracy]]. Prior to declaring the new Republic, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] abolished the [[constitutional monarchy]] on November 1, 1922. The [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] then moved to replace the extant Islamic law structure with the laws it had passed during the [[Turkish War of Independence]], beginning in 1919. The modernization of the Law had already begun at the point that the project was undertaken in earnest. A milestone in this process was the passage of the [[Turkish Constitution of 1921]]. Upon the establishment of the Republic on October 29, 1923, the institution of the [[Caliphate]] remained, but the passage of a [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|new constitution]] in 1924 effectively abolished this title held by the Ottoman Sultanate since 1517. With the [[Ottoman Caliphate#Abolishment|negation of the Caliphate]] the final vestiges of Islamic Law are regarded as having disappeared from the Turkish landscape. The Caliphate's powers within Turkey were transferred to the National Assembly and the title has since been inactive. While very unlikely, the Turkish Republic does in theory still retain the right to reinstate the Caliphate, should it ever elect to do so.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Following quickly upon these developments, many social reforms were undertaken. Many of these reforms affected every aspect of Turkish life, moving to erase the legacy of dominance long held by religion and tradition. The Unification of education, installation of a secular education system, and the closure of many religious orders was happened on March 3, 1924. This extended to closure of religious convents and dervish lodges on November 30, 1925. These reforms included the extension to women of voting rights in 1931 and the right to elected office on December 5, 1934. The inclusion of reference to [[laÃ¯citÃ©]] into the [[Turkish Constitution|constitution]] was achieved by an amendment on February 5, 1937, is seen as the final act in the project of instituting complete separation between governmental and religious affairs in Turkey.

==Constitutional principles==
{{See also|Constitution of Turkey}}
The Constitution asserts that Turkey is a [[secular]] and [[democracy|democratic]] [[republic]], deriving its [[sovereignty]] from the people. The sovereignty rests with the Turkish Nation, who delegates its exercise to an elected unicameral parliament, the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]]. Moreover, Article 4: declares the immovability the founding principles of the Republic defined in the first three Articles:
#&quot;[[secularism]], [[social equality]], [[Legal egalitarianism|equality before law]]&quot;
#&quot;[[Republic|the Republican form of government]]&quot;
#&quot;[[Central Administration|the indivisibility of the Republic and of the Turkish Nation]]&quot;,
Constitution bans any proposals for the modification of these articles. Each of these concepts which were distributed in the three articles of the constitution can not be achieved without the other two concepts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
The constitution requires a central administration which would lose its meaning (effectiveness, coverage, etc.) if the system is not based on laÃ¯citÃ©, social equality, and equality before law. Vice versa, if the Republic differentiate itself based on social, religious differences, administration can not be equal to the population when the administration is central.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The system which tried to be established in the constitution sets out to found a unitary nation-state based on the principles of secular democracy.

==Impact on society==
{{See also|Politics of Turkey}}

The [[Turkish Constitution]] recognizes [[freedom of religion]] for ''individuals'' whereas the ''religious communities'' are placed under the protection of state, but the constitution explicitly states that they cannot become involved in the political process (by forming a religious party for instance) and no party can claim that it represents a form of religious belief. Nevertheless, religious sensibilities are generally represented through conservative parties.

In recent history, two parties have been ordered to close ([[Welfare Party]] ({{lang-tr|Refah Partisi}}) in 1998 and [[Virtue Party]] ({{lang-tr|Fazilet Partisi}}) in 2001)  by the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Constitutional Court]] for Islamist activities and attempts to &quot;redefine the secular nature of the republic&quot;. The first party to be closed for suspected fundamentalist activities was the [[Progressive Republican Party]] on June 3, 1925.

The current governing party in Turkey, the conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] ({{lang-tr|Adalet ve KalkÄ±nma Partisi}} or {{lang|tr|''AKP''}}) has often been accused of following an Islamist agenda.

Issues relating to Turkey's secularism were discussed in the lead up to the [[Turkish presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential elections]], in which the ruling party chose a candidate with Islamic connections, [[Abdullah GÃ¼l]], for the first time in its secular republic.  While some in Turkey have expressed concern that the nomination could represent a move away from Turkey's secularist traditions, including particularly Turkey's priority on equality between the sexes, others have suggested that the conservative party has effectively promoted modernization while reaching out to more traditional and religious elements in Turkish society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabrina Tavernise|Tavernise, Sabrina]]. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/world/europe/25turkey.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp In Turkey, a Sign of a Rising Islamic Middle Class],&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'', April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Must&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6587061.stm &quot;Turkey 'must have secular leader'&quot;], ''[[BBC News]]'', April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 22, 2007 it was reported that the more religiously conservative ruling party won a larger than expected electoral victory in the parliamentary elections.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sabrina Tavernise|Tavernise, Sabrina]]. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/world/europe/23turkey.html?ex=1342929600&amp;en=6e633da0fb2c0b2f&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Ruling Party in Turkey Wins Broad Victory],&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'', July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey's preservation and maintenance of its secular identity has been a profound issue and source of tension. Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan]] has spoken out in favor of limited Islamism and against the active restrictions,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} instituted by [[Kemal AtatÃ¼rk]] on wearing the Islamic-style [[Hijab|head scarves]] in government offices and schools. The [[Republic Protests]] ({{lang-tr|Cumhuriyet Mitingleri}}) were a series of peaceful mass rallies that took place in [[Turkey]] in the spring of 2007 in support of the [[Kemalist ideology|Kemalist]] ideals of [[state secularism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6554851.stm|title=Secular rally targets Turkish PM|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-08-05|date=2007-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitutional rule that prohibits discrimination on religious grounds is taken very seriously. Turkey, as a secular country, prohibits by law the wearing of religious headcover and theo-political symbolic garments for both genders in government buildings, schools, and universities;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Islamic veil across Europe&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5414098.stm |title=The Islamic veil across Europe|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2006-12-13|date=2006-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a law upheld by the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] as &quot;legitimate&quot; on November 10, 2005 in ''[[Leyla Åahin v. Turkey]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leyla Åahin v. Turkey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2005/Nov/GrandChamberJudgmentLeylaSahinvTurkey101105.htm|title=Leyla Åahin v. Turkey|publisher=[[European Court of Human Rights]]|accessdate=2008-08-21|date=2005-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strict application of secularism in Turkey has been credited for enabling women to have access to greater opportunities, compared to countries with a greater influence of religion in public affairs, in matters of education, employment, wealth as well as political, social and cultural freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and Politics in Turkey|first=Ali|last=ÃarkoÄlu|publisher=Routledge|location=UK|year=2004|isbn=0-4153-4831-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415348315&amp;id=t5G_zw9exMQC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=nBltWxHPjd&amp;dq=Religion+in+Turkey&amp;sig=gLF9WOvOo0qZO5iwyUQSUc26Ya0#PPA28,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also paradoxical with the Turkish secularism is the fact that [[Identity document]] cards of Turkish citizens include the specification of the card holder's religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvi.gov.tr/Hizmetler,Nufus_Cuzdani.html State ID cards], ''General Directorate of Population and Citizenship Matters'', [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Ministry of the Interior]] {{tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration was perceived for some as representing a form of the state's surveillance over its citizens' religious choices.

The mainstream [[Hanafi]]te school of [[Sunni Islam]] is entirely organized by the state, through the ''[[Diyanet Ä°Åleri BaÅkanlÄ±ÄÄ±]]'' (Religious Affairs Directorate), which supervises all [[mosque]]s, educates the imams who work in them, and approves all content for religious services and prayers. It appoints imams, who are classified as civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Jonathan. ''World Survey of Religion and the State'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, ISBN 9780521707589, page 247&lt;/ref&gt; This micromanagement of Sunni religious at times seems much more sectarian than secular as it violates the principle of state neutrality in religious practice.  Groups that have expressed dissatisfaction with this situation include a variety of extra-governmental Sunni / Hanafi groups (such as the [[Said NursÃ®|Nurci]] movement), whose interpretation of Islam tends to be more activist; and the non-Sunni [[Alevi]]lik, whose members tend to resent supporting the Sunni establishment with their tax monies (the Turkish state does not subsidize Alevi religious activities).

==Criticism==
Critics{{Who|date=August 2008}} argue that the Turkish state's support for and regulation of [[Sunni]] religious institutions{{ndash}}including mandatory religious education for children deemed by the state to be Muslims{{ndash}}amount to de facto violations of secularism. Debate arises over the issue of to what degree religious observance ought to be restricted to the [[private sphere]]{{ndash}}most famously in connection with the issues of [[Islamic dress controversy in Europe|head-scarves]] and religious-based political parties (cf. [[Welfare Party]], [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]]). The issue of an independent Greek Orthodox seminary is also a matter of controversy in regard to Turkey's accession to the European Union, the reason being that it makes no sense for Turkey to completely oppress a small theological education center when it funds thousands more.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Also the fact that only Sunni Muslims receive state salaries when working as appointed clergy is another issue being criticised.

===Headscarf controversy===
{{See|Headscarf controversy in Turkey}}
''Many of the passages citations can be found at the UNHCR&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,IRBC,,TUR,,4885a91a8,0.html Turkey: Situation of women who wear headscarves, UNHCR]&lt;/ref&gt;

With a policy of official secularism, the Turkish government has traditionally [[banned]] the wearing of headscarves by women who work in the [[public]] sector. The ban applies to [[teachers]], [[lawyers]], [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] and others working on state premises. The ban on headscarves in the [[civil service]] and [[educational]] and [[political]] institutions was expanded to cover non-state institutions. Authorities began to enforce the headscarf ban among mothers accompanying their children to [[school]] events or [[public]] [[swimming pools]], while female [[lawyers]] and [[journalists]] who refused to comply with the ban were expelled from public buildings such as [[courtrooms]] and [[universities]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}. In 1999, the ban on headscarves in the public sphere hit the headlines when [[Merve KavakÃ§Ä±]], a newly elected MP for the [[Virtue Party]] was prevented from taking her oath in the National Assembly because she wore a headscarf. The constitutional rule that prohibits discrimination on religious grounds is taken very seriously. Turkey, as a secular country, prohibits by law the wearing of religious headcover and theo-political symbolic garments for both genders in government buildings, schools, and universities;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Islamic veil across Europe&quot;/&gt; a law upheld by the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] as &quot;legitimate&quot; on November 10, 2005 in ''[[Leyla Åahin v. Turkey]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leyla Åahin v. Turkey&quot;/&gt;

====Workplace====
According to Country Reports 2007, women who wore headscarves and their supporters &quot;were disciplined or lost their jobs in the public sector&quot; (US 11 March 2008, Sec. 2.c). [[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW) reports that in late 2005, the [[Administrative Supreme Court]] ruled that a teacher was not eligible for a promotion in her school because she wore a headscarf outside of work (Jan. 2007). An immigration counsellor at the Embassy of Canada in Ankara stated in 27 April 2005 correspondence with the Research Directorate that public servants are not permitted to wear a headscarf while on duty, but headscarved women may be [[employed]] in the [[private sector]]. In 12 April 2005 correspondence sent to the [[Research Directorate]], a professor of political science specializing in women's issues in Turkey at [[Bogazici University]] in [[Istanbul]] indicated that women who wear a headscarf &quot;could possibly be denied employment in private or [[government]] sectors.&quot; Conversely, some [[municipalities]] with a more traditional constituency might attempt to hire specifically those women who wear a headscarf (Professor 12 April 2005). The professor did add, however, that headscarved women generally experience difficulty in obtaining positions as teachers, judges, lawyers, or doctors in the public service (ibid.). More recent or corroborating information on the headscarf ban in the public service could not be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate.

The London-based [[Sunday Times]] reports that while the ban is officially in place only in the public sphere, many private firms similarly avoid hiring women who wear headscarves (6 May 2007). [[MERO]] notes that women who wear headscarves may have more difficulty finding a job or obtaining a desirable wage (Apr. 2008), although this could not be corroborated among the sources consulted by the [[Research Directorate]].

====Medical care====
According to the Sunday Times, headscarves are banned inside Turkish [[hospitals]], and doctors may not don a headscarf on the job (6 May 2007). Nevertheless, MERO reports that under Turkey's current administration, seen by secularists to have a hidden religious agenda (The New York Times 19 February 2008; Washington Post 26 February 2008), doctors who wear headscarves have been employed in some public hospitals (MERO Apr. 2008).

The professor of political science at [[Bogazici University]] in Turkey stated that, in addition to never having come across any cases where women wearing headscarves had been denied access to medical care in private or public medical centres, he felt it would be unlikely that this would occur (12 April 2005). The Immigration Counsellor at the Embassy of Canada in [[Ankara]] stated that &quot;women who wear headscarves have full access to medical care&quot; (27 April 2005), though news reports &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=900669&amp;title=ninesi-yasindaki-hastayi-basortulu-diye-muayene-etmedi |title=GÃ¼ndem Ninesi yaÅÄ±ndaki hastayÄ± baÅÃ¶rtÃ¼lÃ¼ diye muayene etmedi ZAMAN |language={{tr icon}} |publisher=Zaman.com.tr |date= |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NGO]] reports to the [[UN]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ohchr1&quot;&gt;http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session8/TR/BFRL_UPR_TUR_S08_2010_BecketFundforReligiousLiberty.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; confirm that &quot;women wearing the headscarf have been denied medical care in Turkish hospitals.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ohchr1&quot;/&gt;

===Ban lifted===
On 9 February 2008, Turkey's parliament approved a constitutional amendment that lifted the ban on Islamic headscarves in universities. Prior to this date, the public ban on headscarves officially extended to students on university campuses throughout Turkey. Nevertheless, according to Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2007, &quot;some faculty members permitted students to wear head coverings in class&quot;. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty notes that since the 1990s, some rectors have allowed students to wear headscarves.

On 5 June 2008, Turkey's [[Constitutional Court]] annulled the parliament's proposed [[Constitutional amendment|amendment]] intended to lift the headscarf ban, ruling that removing the ban would run counter to official secularism. While the highest court's decision to uphold the headscarf ban cannot be appealed (AP 7 June 2008), the government has nevertheless indicated that it is considering adopting measures to weaken the court's authority.

===Wearing of head-covering===
According to the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation around 62% of women wear the headscarf in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article1752230.ece |title=Head scarves to topple secular Turkey? |first=Christina |last=Lamb |date=2007-04-23 | location=London | work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article1752230.ece |title=Headscarf war threatens to split Turkey |work=Times Online |date=2007-05-06 | location=London | first1=Christina | last1=Lamb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2007/04/23/headscarf/ |title=Head scarves to topple secular Turkey? |work=[[Salon.com]] |first=Tracy
|last=Clark-Flory |accessdate=2008-08-04 |date=2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkeyâs strong secularism has resulted in what have been perceived by some as strictures on the [[freedom of religion]]; for example, the [[headscarf]] has long been prohibited in public universities, and a constitutional amendment passed in February 2008 that permitted women to wear it on university campuses sparked considerable [[controversy]]. In addition, the armed forces have maintained a vigilant watch over Turkeyâs political secularism, which they affirm to be a keystone among Turkeyâs founding principles. The military has not left the maintenance of a secular political process to chance, however, and has intervened in politics on a number of occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/609790/Turkey Turkey], [[Britannica Online Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
