'''Elive''' (&quot;'''E'''nlightenment '''live'''&quot;) is a [[GNU/Linux distribution]] based on [[Debian]] for legacy and commodity hardware with Intel processors. Elive uses the [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] [[X window manager]] instead of [[GNOME]] or [[KDE]]. Elive is a fully functional distribution with a [[Live CD]] counterpart that allows the user to sample the distribution before installing it on the system.

Elive can be used like any [[Live CD]] or installed to the hard drive to access its full features. Elive utilizes [[UnionFS]], which allows users to install software packages using [[Synaptic Package Manager]] and/or [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]], while the user's computer is running from the [[Live CD]].

==Features==
Administration of Elive is centralized by its flagship application Elpanel, which was developed especially for Elive. Elpanel is an animated Administration applet that is written in [[Enlightenment Foundation Libraries#Edje|Edje]].

Elpanel is a [[virtual]] [[launchpad]] to various other administration tools which are [[nested]] within Elpanel via labeled custom [[icons]].

Elive utilizes the [[Mozilla Corporation software rebranded in Debian|Iceweasel]] browser and the [[Mozilla Corporation software rebranded in Debian|Icedove]] mail client with pre-configured [[GnuPG]] [[Filename extension|extensions]] to [[encrypt]] and [[digital signature|digitally sign]] emails. These tools allow the user to  [[digital signature|digitally sign]], [[encrypt]] and [[decrypt]] correspondence with minimal effort.

Elive has support for [[multimedia]] [[codecs]] of various audio and video formats.

====A short list of other pre-installed multimedia applications on Elive====

* [[XMMS]]
* [[Mplayer]]
* Oxine
* Stream Tuner
* ReSound
* GtkPod
* [[GIMP]]
* [[Blender (software)|Blender]]

A [[Live USB]] of Elive can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past distribution issues==
Elive developers asked for a payment (via PayPal) of $15 or more to download the live CD. Alternatively, users could apply for free one-use &quot;invitation codes&quot; by writing long essays promoting Elive and posting about it on various commercial websites. The Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.0 License does not seem to prohibit exact re-distribution. Currently (2010), Elive is now freely available to download, but not free to install. Any user can download and run the Elive system as a liveCD for free, but in order to install the OS one needs to donate or go through the processes mentioned earlier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elivecd.org/Download/Stable&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozos, [[OpenGEU]], [[Moon OS]], and the recently released [[Bodhi Linux]] all use the E17 desktop environment like Elive, but unlike Elive are free to download and install. They use a very simple installation process very similar to Ubuntu and Linux Mint.

==History and development process==
The second to last release (0.6) let the user choose between [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] 0.16 (stable) or 0.17 (development release). Thus, it is a good way for the user to have a look at the latest version of this uncommon graphical environment.

Preceding the 0.5 release, Elive was built on the Morphix distribution, but the new one uses the Dsslive [[Application framework|framework]].

==Releases==
* 0.1: The initial Beta release with the name Elive, which was Tezcatlipotix prior to the name Elive. This was based on [[Knoppix]] as well, but considered unstable yet working
* 0.2: Several bugs fixed after reports and user experiences, yet ELive was still considered a development and working version
* 0.3: The first stable version and the base was switched from [[Knoppix]] to Morphix
* 0.4: Code named 'Serenity'; here Elive switched from Morphix to DSS (Debian Script Set)
* 0.4.2: The second release of 'Serenity', with major revisions and ATI driver revisions
* 0.5: Heralded release of Elive Revolution
* 0.6: Second release of Elive Revolution named Revolution+
* 1.0: Release of The Luxurious Elive Gem
* 1.9-25: Release of Elive with Compiz (ecomorph)
* 2.0: Release of the Stable version Elive Topaz

==System requirements==
The &quot;minimum hardware requirements&quot; for running Elive are:

*100&amp;nbsp;MHz CPU
*64 MB of RAM
*At least 3 GB of disk space (for full installation and no swap space)
*VGA graphics card capable of 640x480 resolution
*CD-ROM drive Or USB-boot capable BIOS.

The &quot;recommended hardware requirements&quot; are:

*300&amp;nbsp;MHz
*128 Mb of RAM
*At least 3.5 GB of disk space (for full installation and swap space)
*VGA graphics card capable of 800x600 resolution
*CD-ROM drive or USB-boot capable BIOS.
