== Album history ==
''A Cinderella Story: Original Soundtrack'' was released to accompany Duff's 2004 film ''[[A Cinderella Story]]''. Duff contributed three new songs to the soundtrack, a duet with her sister [[Haylie Duff|Haylie]], a cover of &quot;[[Our Lips Are Sealed#Hilary and Haylie Duff version|Our Lips Are Sealed]]&quot; by [[The Go-Go's]], and the song &quot;Anywhere but Here,&quot; taken from her debut album ''[[Metamorphosis (Hilary Duff album)|Metamorphosis]]'' (2003).&lt;ref name=&quot;Phares&quot;/&gt; Among other contributors to the soundtrack were [[Jesse McCartney]], [[MxPx]], [[MÃ½a]] and Haylie Duff, who recorded the song &quot;One in this World&quot; in addition to her duet with Hilary. &quot;Hear You Me&quot; by Jimmy Eat World was played in the movie, but was not released on the soundtrack, although it should have been. In the film [[Kara DioGuardi]] performs the song ''Now You Know'' while on the soundtrack Hilary Duff performs the song. Also in the film &quot;Best Day of My Life&quot; is performed by Robert Palmer and features Micheal Duff while on the soundtrack Jesse McCartney performs the song. The lyrics for &quot;[[I'll Be (Edwin McCain song)|I'll Be]]&quot; by [[Edwin McCain]] in the movie feature a different line in the chorus from the soundtrack, with &quot;I'll be love's suicide&quot; while the soundtrack's features &quot;I'll be with the trappings of love&quot; in the chorus.

&quot;Our Lips Are Sealed&quot; was released as the first and only single from the album in June 2004. The Duffs' version peaked at #8 in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/2501|title=Hilary Duff and Haylie Duff - Our Lips Are Sealed|work=Î±Charts.us|accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heather Phares of [[Allmusic]] gave a positive review of the soundtrack, awarding it three out of five stars. She praised Duff's songs, noting that they &quot;display a little more edge and depth while still remaining appropriate for a [[teen pop]] singer like Duff and her audience,&quot; and added that they were complemented by the contributions from other artists. She claimed that Duff contributing to the majority of the album would &quot;tide [her] fans over&quot; before the release of her [[Hilary Duff (album)|eponymous third album]]. Phares finalized her review stating, &quot;''A Cinderella Story'' is an admittedly lightweight but solidly entertaining soundtrack that delivers exactly what its audience wants from it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phares&quot;/&gt;
