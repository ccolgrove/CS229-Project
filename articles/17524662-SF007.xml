'''''Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me''''' (&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;) was the weekly youth supplement to the [[Belgium|Belgian]] newspaper ''[[Le VingtiÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle]]'' (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;) from 1928 to 1940. The comics series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' first appeared in its pages.

==History==
''Le VingtiÃ¨me SiÃ¨cle'' was a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] newspaper from [[Brussels]], led by [[abbot]] [[Norbert Wallez]]. In 1925, 18 years old [[HergÃ©]] (Georges Prosper Remi), the creator of Tintin, worked there, first as a [[clerk (position)|clerk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goddin |first=Philippe |authorlink=Philippe Goddin |title=HergÃ©. Levenslijnen. Biografie |year=2008 |publisher=Moulinsart |language=Dutch |isbn=9782874241710 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after he fulfilled his [[conscription|military service]], as an [[illustrator]] for the main pages and for some [[supplement (publishing)|supplement]]s like the weekly arts pages and the female section.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 110.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1928, the abbot decided to start a weekly 8 page youth supplement, appearing every Thursday. He called it ''Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me'' (The Little Twentieth). HergÃ© was named [[Editor-in-Chief]]. In the first issue, appearing on November 1, 1928, he illustrated a short comic made by [[Desmedt]], the sports editor of the newspaper called ''[[Flup, NÃ©nesse, Poussette and Cochonnet|Les Aventures de Flup, NÃ©nesse, Poussette et Cochonnet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Sensing that this comic lacked spirit and was rather old-fashioned compared to the current American comics and to the works of [[Alain Saint-Ogan]], HergÃ© started working on his own comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Grand Ry |first=Michel |authorlink= |coauthors=Nizette, AndrÃ©; and Lechat, Jean-Louis |title=Le livre d'or de la bande dessinÃ©e |year=1986 |publisher=Centre de la bande dessinÃ©e Belge |location=[[Brussels]] |pages=4â5 |chapter=HergÃ©}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, he met Germaine Kieckens, the secretary of the abbot at the newspaper. They got engaged in 1932&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 173.&lt;/ref&gt; and married on July 20 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 1929, in issue 11, ''[[Tintin in the Land of the Soviets]]'' began.&lt;ref name=Goddin124&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Every issue featured two pages of the story, and HergÃ© often made covers for the supplement depicting Tintin as well. A year later, on January 23, 1930, the supplement increased from 8 to 16 pages, and the first page of ''[[Quick &amp; Flupke]]'', a new [[gag strip]], appeared in the [[magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt; 310 gags would appear before the paper folded. 

The supplement, especially the comics, were an overwhelming success, with [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of the [[publication]] quadrupling on Thursdays.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 119.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of each of the first three stories of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', an actual reception of the comic hero (played by an actor) at the station in [[Brussels]] was organized, with thousands of people attending. The first of these was attended by [[Zita of Bourbon-Parma]], the former empress of [[AustriaâHungary|Austria]], and her children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 142, 158 and 183.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the meantime the first assistants to HergÃ© were hired to help him fill the supplement and to do minor work on ''Tintin'' and ''Quick &amp; Flupke'': EugÃ¨ne Van Nijverseel, better known as Evany,&lt;ref name=Goddin124/&gt; and Paul Jamin (also signing as Jam).&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 137.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To capitalize on the success, a new publishing house was started, ''Les Ã©ditions du Petit VingtiÃ¨me'', publishing the first three books of ''Tintin'' and the first two of ''Quick and Flupke'' before folding and passing the rights in 1934 to [[Casterman]], which was better suited to cope with the international success of Tintin (which by then also appeared in France and Switzerland). Both the newspaper comics and the album publications were in black and white, although the covers to the supplement, which were also often made by HergÃ©, used a supporting colour.

Between February 8 and August 16, 1934, HergÃ© also published the more juvenile story ''Les aventures de Popol et Virginie chez les Lapinos'' (translated as ''[[Popol out west]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 200.&lt;/ref&gt; This story was only first published as an album (in [[French language|French]]) in 1952 though.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tintinmilou.free.fr/rg/oeuvres.htm Other works by HergÃ©] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1940, an attempt was made to launch ''[[De Bengel]]'', a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translation of ''Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me''. This magazine marked the first appearance of Tintin in Dutch. The magazine seems to have never been distributed though, and only one copy is known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gva.be/dossiers/-k/kuifje/dossier.asp GvA] Kuifje-dossier (in Dutch). Last accessed July 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of ''Tintin'' and ''Quick &amp; Flupke'' continued in the newspaper supplement until May 1940, when the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] invaded Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Goddin|Goddin, Philippe]] (2008). ''Op. cit.'', 257.&lt;/ref&gt;
