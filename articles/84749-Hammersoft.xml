'''Western Connecticut State University''' ('''Western''', '''WestConn''', or '''WCSU''') is a public university in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[Connecticut]].

It is also home to [[The Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]].

==History==

WestConn started as a teachers' college, training the primary and secondary school educators for Connecticut's [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and surrounding areas. The school's name has changed over the years as it has focused on additional areas of study. First named the Danbury Normal School, in the 1950s it was called the Danbury State Teachers College. It was renamed as Danbury State College in 1959, then Western Connecticut State College in 1967, and finally, in 1983, Western Connecticut State University.&lt;ref&gt;

===Campus===

Western Connecticut has two campuses (Midtown and West Side) located three miles apart connected by a campus shuttle service.

The Midtown Campus is the original campus, located near Downtown Danbury.  It is home to the School of Arts and Sciences, School of Professional Studies, and most of the school administration. Housing on this campus include; Fairfield Hall, Litchfield Hall, and Newbury Hall.  The Midtown Student center is located on this campus.

The West Side Campus is located on land purchased in the 1970s on the outskirts of Danbury.  This {{convert|439|acre|km2|sing=on}} lot is home to the [[Ancell School of Business]], a nature center, amphitheater, and three residence halls. The West Side also houses the athletic facilities, including the O'Neill Center. On January 23, 2007 the new West Side Campus Center was officially opened.  This new facility serves as a student center, meeting, and banquet facility for the West Side Campus.

A major improvement program was started in the mid-1990s to beautify the campus.  Several parking lots became green space, and improvements were made to the landscaping.  While a significant improvement, the full extent of this beautification is not immediately apparent and will take several years to reach full maturity.

The &quot;WestConn at Waterbury&quot; program is located on the campus of Naugatuck Valley Community College.  The program offers undergraduate courses and the [[Master of Health Administration]] (M.H.A.).
