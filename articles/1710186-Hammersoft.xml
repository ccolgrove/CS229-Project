'''Georgina Hale''' (born 4 August 1943) is an award-winning [[England|English]] [[actress]] notable for many stage, film and television appearances; often in the works of director [[Ken Russell]] and writer [[Simon Gray]]. She is perhaps best known for her [[BAFTA]]-winning performance as [[Alma Mahler]] in the 1974 film, ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]''.

In 2010, Hale was featured in an article in the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', where she was ranked third in a list of ten great [[character actor]]s in British television.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/gallery/2010/jul/27/british-character-actors|title=Looks Familiar: 10 great British character actors|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=September 19, 2010 | location=London | date=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and early career==
Hale was born in [[Ilford]], [[England]], to George Robert Hale and Dorothy (nÃ©e Fordham).&lt;ref name=&quot;FilmReference.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/15/Georgina-Hale.html|title=Georgina Hale Biography (1943-)|publisher=FilmReference.com|accessdate=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poorly educated as a child, Hale was unable to read or write for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;T-Room.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t-room.co.uk/georginainterview.php |title=Georgina Hale Interview|publisher=T-Room.co.uk|accessdate=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a teenager, she worked as an apprentice hairdresser and studied acting at a [[Stanislavski Method]] studio in [[London]], before being accepted into the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].

==Acting career==
===Stage===
An accomplished stage actress, Hale made her professional debut at Stratford as a walk-on. She subsequently appeared in rep at Canterbury, Windsor and Ipswich; then at the Liverpool Playhouse in 1967, where her parts included the title role in ''[[Gigi]]'', and Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. At the Thorndike Theatre in Leatherhead in October 1975 she played Liza Doolittle in ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', followed by an acclaimed portrayal of Nina in [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' at the Derby Playhouse in July 1976, making her West End debut in the production when it transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre in August 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in the Theatre, 17th edition (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other roles included: Marie Caroline David in ''The Tribades'' (Hampstead, May 1978); Melanie in ''Boo Hoo'' (Open Space, July 1978); and Bobbi Michele in ''[[The Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' (Royal Exchange, Manchester, April 1979 - transferring to the [[Criterion Theatre]]  in November 1979).

In 1981, Hale played the role of Josie in Nell Dunnâs play, ''[[Steaming (play)|Steaming]]'', at the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London.  Hale received a 1981 Best Comedy Performance [[Olivier Awards|Olivier Award]] nomination for her performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Officiallondontheatre.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/olivier_awards/view/item98515/Olivier-Winners-1981-/|title=1981 Olivier Award Nominees|publisher=Officiallondontheatre.com|accessdate=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later in April 1982 she starred opposite [[Glenda Jackson]] in ''Summit Conference'' at the Lyric Theatre, playing [[Benito Mussolini]]'s mistress [[Clara Petacci]] in a revival of [[Citizens_Theatre#Robert_David_MacDonald|Robert David MacDonald]]'s play for the Glasgow [[Citizens Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Theatre Record Index, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Hale has made numerous appearances with the Citizens.  These include ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1991), ''[[The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore|The Milk Train Doesnât Stop Here Anymore]]'' (1994), ''[[Britannicus (play)|Britannicus]]'' (2002) and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]âs ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' (2002).

Other notable stage appearances include [[Simon Gray]]'s ''[[Life Support]]'', opposite [[Alan Bates]], at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] in London (1997),  [[Noel Coward]]âs ''[[Semi-Monde]]'' at the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] (2001), [[Roger Hall]]'s ''Take A Chance On Me'' at the [[New End Theatre]] (2003), and as Nell in [[Samuel Beckett]]âs ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'' at the [[Barbican Centre]] (2006).

===Film===
Haleâs most notable film role is arguably that of [[Alma Mahler]] in [[Ken Russell]]âs ''[[Mahler (film)|Mahler]]'' (1974), a [[biopic]] of the [[Austria]]n [[composer]] and [[Conducting|conductor]], [[Gustav Mahler]].  Hale received the 1974 Most Promising Newcomer [[BAFTA]] Film Award for her performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bafta.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafta.org/awards/film/nominations/?year=1974|title=1974 Bafta Winners|publisher=Bafta.org|accessdate=May 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hale also made appearances in a number of [[Ken Russell|Russell]]âs other films, with supporting roles in ''[[The Devils (film)|The Devils]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Boyfriend]]'' (1971), and cameo roles in ''[[Lisztomania (film)|Lisztomania]]'' (1975), ''[[Valentino (1977 film)|Valentino]]'' (1977), and ''[[Treasure Island]]'' (1995).{{quote box|width=25%|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote=&quot;Georgina Hale...an actress of such sensitivity that she can make the hair rise on your arms.&quot;|source=[[Ken Russell]], 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesOnline.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article2348755.ece|title=Actresses Who Have Bewitched Me - Ken Russell|publisher=TimesOnline.com|accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London | date=August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hale had a small role in the 1980 [[Walt Disney Productions|Walt Disney]] film ''[[The Watcher in the Woods]]'', starring [[Bette Davis]].  Hale took the role of the younger version of Davisâ character largely because of her admiration for Davis.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABDVD&quot;&gt;{{cite video
