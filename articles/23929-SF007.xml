'''PHP-Nuke''' is a web-based automated news publishing and [[content management system]] based on [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]] originally authored by Franscisco Burzi. The system is controlled using a web-based user interface. PHP-Nuke was originally a [[fork (software)|fork]] of the Thatware news portal system.

PHP-Nuke was originally released under the [[GNU General Public License]] as [[free software]]. Versions after 7.5 require a license fee. This is permitted under the [[GNU GPL]] (providing the [[source code]] is included), and the purchaser of the software has the right to freely distribute the source code of the product. Burzi no longer owns the PHP-Nuke site.

As of version 5.6, the display of a [[copyright]] message on webpages is required in accordance with the GPL section 2(c).&lt;ref&gt;[http://phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=6966]&lt;/ref&gt;

PHP-Nuke requires a [[web server]] which supports the [[PHP]] extension (such as the [[Apache HTTP Server]]), as well as an [[SQL]] database (such as [[MySQL]], [[mSQL]], [[PostgreSQL]], [[ODBC]], [[ADABAS]], [[Sybase]] or [[InterBase]]).

==Features of==
PHP-Nuke is a content management system allowing webmasters to create community-based portals (websites), allowing users and editors to post news items (user-submitted news items are selected by editors) or other types of articles. Registered users can then comment on these articles.

Modules can be added to the PHP-Nuke system allowing additional features such as an [[Internet forum]], Calendar, News Feed, [[FAQ]]'s , Private Messaging and others. The site is maintained through an administration interface.

PHP-Nuke includes the following standard modules:
