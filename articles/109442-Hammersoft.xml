'''Kendall''' is a [[suburb]]an [[neighborhoods of Miami-Dade County|neighborhood]] of [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|metropolitan]] [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. As of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 census]], the area had a total population of 75,226.

While the defined boundaries of the community have been labeled Kendall by the US Census Bureau, locals often included western communities, such as [[The Hammocks, Florida|The Hammocks]], [[Country Walk, Florida|Country Walk]], [[The Crossings, Florida|The Crossings]], [[Kendale Lakes, Florida|Kendale Lakes]], [[Kendall West, Florida|Kendall West]], and [[Three Lakes, Florida|Three Lakes]], [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]s of Kendall. According to the census, Kendall is home to over 11,000 [[Colombian American]]s, one of the largest populations in the United States.

Kendall is served by the [[Metrorail (Miami)|Miami Metrorail]] at [[Dadeland North (Metrorail station)|Dadeland North]] and [[Dadeland South (Metrorail station)|Dadeland South]] stations. Both stations provide service from [[Dadeland, Florida|Dadeland]] to [[Downtown Miami]], and [[Miami Central Station]] at [[Miami International Airport]] in [[2012 in rail transport|2012]]. Dadeland South station is a major transit depot in the area, connecting the southernmost suburbs of [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] and [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]] to Metrorail via [[limited-stop]] [[bus rapid transit]] along the [[Miami-Dade Transit#South Miami-Dade Busway|South Miami-Dade Busway]].

==History==
Much of what is now Kendall was purchased from the State of Florida in 1883 by the Florida Land and Mortgage Company. It is named after Henry John Broughton Kendall, a [[Board of directors|director]] of the company who moved to the area in the 1900s to manage the company's land. As the land was not open to [[Homestead Act|homesteading]], development was slow well into the 20th century. A post office opened in 1914, and the first school opened in 1929. After the end of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|land boom]] in 1926, some residents left. Two [[Seminole]] camps were in the Kendall area, and Seminoles continued to live there into the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jean. (1986) ''Villages of South Dade''. St. Petersburg, Florida: Byron Kennedy and Company. ISBN 0-041072-12-6 Pp. 39â49.&lt;/ref&gt;
