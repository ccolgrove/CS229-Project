==Plot==
===Story===
''Gurren Lagann'' takes place in a fictional future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages.  These villages have no contact with the surface world (or other villages) and are under constant threat of earthquakes.  Select villagers, called diggers, are conscripted to expand their homes deeper underground.  Simon, a meek young digger ostracized by his peers, finds solace in his best friend and older brother figure, an eccentric delinquent named Kamina.  Kamina allows Simon to join his &quot;gang,&quot; Team Gurren, to help him achieve his dream of visiting the surface world.

One day, Simon unearths a drill-shaped key called a Core Drill, followed by a small mecha resembling a face called a Gunman. Shortly thereafter, a giant Gunman crashes through the ceiling and begins attacking the village, followed by a girl named Yoko who attempts to repel the Gunman. Simon uses his Core Drill to activate the smaller Gunman, which Kamina names Lagann and is used to destroy the larger Gunman and break through to the surface world.

Simon and Kamina learn from Yoko that humans on the surface world are attacked each day by Gunmen piloted by Beastmen, humanoid creatures who serve as Lord genome's army. Kamina hijacks a Gunman and names it Gurren, combining it with Simon's Lagann to form the mecha Gurren Lagann. Their actions inspire other humans to steal their own Gunmen and join Team Gurren, which is eventually renamed Team Dai-Gurren. Eventually Team Dai-Gurren captures an enemy Gunmen fortress to use as their base of operations, though Kamina is killed in the preceding battle.

Simon sinks into depression following Kamina's death when he meets Nia, Lordgenome's daughter. Team Dai-Gurren is initially distrustful of her, but allows her to join when it becomes apparent that she was abandoned by her father. Nia helps Simon come to terms with Kamina's death, and he takes up the role as Team Dai-Gurren's leader, leading them to defeat Lordgenome and the Beastman army.

Seven years later, mankind has prospered on the surface world with Simon and the members of Team Dai-Gurren serving as the world's government. This attracts the attention of a new threat called the Anti-Spirals, who use Nia as their messenger to announce the moon's collision with Earth, which will wipe out all life on the planet. With guidance from a partially resurrected Lordgenome, Team Dai-Gurren prevents the moon's collision, rescues Nia, and destroys the Anti-Spirals. This, however, causes Nia to fade away and die as her own existence is tied to that of the Anti-Spirals. Simon spends the rest of his life wandering the planet as a nameless vagrant while his comrades set out to contact other races throughout the galaxy to ensure the safety of the universe.

===Main characters===
{{main|List of Gurren Lagann characters}}
;{{Nihongo|[[Simon (Gurren Lagann)|Simon]]|ã·ã¢ã³|Shimon}}
:{{anime voices|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]|[[Yuri Lowenthal]]}}
:Simon is the main protagonist of Gurren Lagann. He is introduced as a fourteen-year-old digger from Giha village who is looked down upon by many of his peers for his timid and weak character. He greatly admires Kamina, one of his few friends in the village, and refers to him as his brother despite them not being related by blood. Simon spends much of the first quarter of the series following after Kamina, but gradually acquires his own fighting spirit and determination over the course of the series, acting on his own more often until his personality mirrors that of Kamina. His discovery of the Core Drill and the Gunman &quot;Lagann&quot; are what set the events of the series in motion. Throughout the series, Simon primarily pilots Lagann, which is capable of producing drills from any part of its body when it reacts to Simon's Spiral energy. He uses this ability to combine with Kamina's Gunman, Gurren, to form Gurren Lagann. He can also take control of other Gunmen using this ability.

[[File:Gurren-lagann-16-.jpg|thumb|right|Team Dai-Gurren]]
;{{Nihongo|Kamina|ã«ãã}}
:{{anime voices|[[Katsuyuki Konishi]]|[[Kyle Hebert]]}}
:Kamina is the deutragonist for the first quarter of the series. He is a young delinquent from Giha village who dreams of leaving his underground home and go to the surface world, which he saw as a child. His extremely passionate and self-confident personality causes him to act as a foil to the more timid and weak-willed Simon, and serves to instill courage within Simon. His actions greatly influence the entire series, as he forms Team Dai-Gurren and acts as its leader to combat the threat of Lordgenome and the beastmen. Early in the series, Kamina hijacks a Gunman he names Gurren, which he pilots while combined with Simon's Lagann to form Gurren Lagann. However, he is killed at the end of the first arc during Team Dai-Gurren's capture of the Dai-Gunzan, which the protagonists use as their base.

;{{Nihongo|Yoko Littner|ã¨ã¼ã³ã»ãªãããã¼|YÅko RittonÄ}}
:{{anime voices|[[Marina Inoue]]|[[Michelle Ruff]]}}
:Yoko is the tertiary protagonist of the series. She is a young woman from Littner, a village neighboring Giha, and is introduced as a member of a small resistance against the Beastmen. She helps introduce Simon and Kamina to the surface world, and becomes a member of Team Gurren soon after. She falls in love with Kamina early in the series, and doesn't think much of Simon until he begins showing signs of self-confidence. After Kamina's death, she tries to help Simon cope and forms a sisterly relationship with him. She does not primarily pilot a Gunman in the series, instead wielding a high-powered energy rifle and using her superb marksmanship and wise council to help her teammates.

;{{Nihongo|Nia Teppelin|ãã¢ã»ããããªã³|Nia Tepperin}}
:Young Nia {{anime voices|[[Yukari Fukui]]|[[Hynden Walch]] (episodes 9-15), [[Bridget Hoffman]] (episodes 17-27)}}
:Nia is a major character introduced directly after Kamina's death in the series. Having lived a sheltered life as the daughter of Lordgenome, the main antagonist of the first half of the series, she is ignorant of the war between the humans and Lordgenome until she is abandoned by her father and discovered by Simon. She is a very polite and naive girl who is curious about the world, and acts a soothing influence for Simon following his depression caused by Kamina's death. The two fall in love and become engaged at the start of the second half of the series, directly after which she is discovered to be an agent of the Anti-Spirals. During this time, Nia is taken over by a cold and uncaring personality called &quot;Messenger Nia&quot; and forced to fight Simon against her will until Simon rescues her.

===Terminology===
====Beastmen====
[[File:G-L - Beastmen Kingdom.jpg|thumb|150px|The Beastmen Generals (clockwise from top) Guame, Cytomander, Thymilph, and Adiane]]
Beastmen are non-Spiral beings, created and cloned by Lordgenome to fight by piloting Gunmen. The numerous animals on the planet are previously failed creations, and thus lack the intelligence that Beastmen have. Beastmen and many other animals found on the planet cannot reproduce, instead multiplying via [[cloning]].
[[File:Gurren Lagann - Generic Ganmen.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Generic Gunmen]]

====Gunmen====
{{main|List of Gurren Lagann mecha}}
{{Nihongo|Gunmen|ã¬ã³ã¡ã³|Ganmen}} are the type of [[mecha]] used in the series. They are modeled to resemble faces with arms and legs, while name itself is derived from a Japanese term that roughly means &quot;huge face&quot; and can be broken down into the words &quot;gun&quot; and &quot;man&quot;. Different Gunmen sport a wide variety of weaponry, which range from primitive weapons such as large clubs or their bare hands, to more advanced weapons such as projectile or beam weapons. Gunmen powered by the &quot;Spiral Energy&quot; inherent in humans' DNA are more powerful than those piloted by Beastmen. The voice broadcaster within each Gunman is linked to the mouth, making it seem as though it is talking. Gurren Lagann can also make several facial expressions.

===Spiral theme===
The [[spiral]] theme is especially prominent throughout the series. Not only is it the basis of strength for the main characters and mankind, but it is presented as a [[philosophy]] and [[way of life]], and as a model of [[physics]]. Lordgenome (whose own name contains the word [[genome]], referring to DNA and its spiraling double helix) notes that it is the natural order of the [[universe]] to coordinate itself into a spiral arrangement. The spiral [[symbol]]izes the [[double helix]] structure of [[DNA]], representing biological [[evolution]], and the spiral structure of a [[galaxy]], representing [[universal evolution]]. Lordgenome's four generals also pay homage to the motif through their names which are derivatives of the four nucleic acids of DNA: Adenine, Thymine, Cytocine, and Guanine. Simon's spiral [[drill]] is used as a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] to symbolize the spiral theme throughout the series. At the same time, the drill motif symbolizes the soul and determination to overcome all obstacles as something which gradually advances &quot;with every revolution&quot;.

In the same way a [[logarithmic spiral]] grows in size with each successive curve, the scope of ''Gurren Lagann's'' story and the scale of its mecha grow in successive steps as the series progresses. By the end of the series, the largest mecha, the [[List of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann mecha#Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann|Tengen Toppa Gurren-Lagann]], contains all the smaller iterations of Gurren-Lagann nested inside like a [[Daruma doll]] or [[matryoshka doll]], reflecting the way the curves of a spiral grow in size but [[Self-similarity|maintain the same shape]].

====Spiral Energy====
In the series' concept, Spiral energy is the power of [[evolution]], generated by [[DNA]]-based beings such as [[human]]s whose [[double helix]] molecular structure allows them to grow stronger through the generations. Spiral energy is what connects those capable of evolution, referred to as Spiral beings, and the universe together. Because Beastmen do not reproduce naturally, they cannot evolve and are thus unable to produce Spiral energy. The amount of Spiral energy produced by an individual varies and is based not only on their own limitations, but also their immediate will to survive and persevere. Spiral energy has both infinite potential and applicationsâit can regenerate and grow new parts on machines to a galactic scale, and even create tunnels through spacetime. One of its most prevalent applications in the series is in weaponry: Spiral-enhanced ammunition provides phenomenal stopping power, making a simple shotgun capable of damaging a Mugann, while Spiral-based warheads and energy beams demonstrate destructive power far in excess of nuclear weapons.

Spiral energy is specifically stated to defy the law of [[Conservation of mass-energy|mass-energy conservation]], which in addition to explaining the creation of [[mass]] that is practically constant during battles, also carries danger if Spiral Energy is overused. Termed &quot;Spiral Nemesis&quot; by the Anti-Spirals, too much Spiral energy may cause all of spacetime to collapse into a [[supermassive black hole]].

====Anti-Spirals====
{{main|List of Gurren Lagann characters#Anti-Spiral|l1=List of Gurren Lagann characters: Anti-Spiral}}
The {{Nihongo|Anti-Spirals|ã¢ã³ã{{=}}ã¹ãã¤ã©ã«|Anchi Supairaru}} serve as the main antagonists of the second half of the series. They are a race of aliens who have abandoned the use of Spiral energy, thus ceasing to evolve, after discovering that limitless evolution could one day lead to the destruction of all spacetime, an event they term the &quot;Spiral Nemesis&quot;. As their name implies, they act to repress other civilizations in the universe that use Spiral energy, fearing that they could pose a threat to the universe if left unchecked. Because Spiral energy is generated by its users' will, the Anti-Spiral employ tactics that induce fear and despair in their enemies. When a Spiral civilization surrenders to the Anti-Spiral's will, which includes Earth prior to Lordgenome's rule, the Anti-Spirals leave behind an automated &quot;defense&quot; system that will activate and attack the civilization if it produces too much Spiral energy.

{{see also|List of Gurren Lagann episodes}}
Produced by the animation studio [[Gainax]] and directed by [[Hiroyuki Imaishi]], ''Gurren Lagann'' aired in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] between April 1 and September 30, 2007. The [[anime]] has twenty-seven episodes plus two specials, the first being the uncensored version of the sixth episode, and the second is episode 5.5, a bonus that came with the Nintendo DS game.

The English version had been previously licensed by [[ADV Films]], but was later acquired by [[Bandai Entertainment]]. A subtitle-only version was released in three volumes in July 2008, and an official English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] with the first two volumes released on November 18, 2008 called &quot;Gurren Lagann Set 01&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The show premiered on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] on July 28, 2008 as part of Sci Fi's [[Ani-Monday]] anime block, airing two episodes each week (and three the final week).&lt;ref name=&quot;gl-sci-fi&quot;/&gt; The European distribution branch of Bandai, Beez Entertainment, is distributing the series in the UK and Europe, with the first DVD set for release on July 6, 2009.&lt;ref name = &quot;Play.com (UK)&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.play.com/DVD/DVD/4-/9189530/Gurren-Lagann-Part-1/Product.html | title= Play.com (UK): Gurren Lagann: Part 1 | publisher=Play.com | accessdate=2009-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English version also aired on [[Animax]] across its English-language networks in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]] starting on May 22, 2009.

====2channel incident====
[[Takami Akai]], the producer of the series and a co-founder of [[Gainax]], announced that he would resign his position effective episode five, which aired on April 29, 2007, over comments that he made regarding posts on the Japanese [[Internet forum]] [[2channel]]. Akai and another Gainax employee, Keiko Mimori, made disparaging remarks about comments criticizing the animation style of the fourth episode of ''Gurren Lagann'', which was completely directed by guest and friend [[Osamu Kobayashi (illustrator)|Osamu Kobayashi]]. With regard to reading the fan criticisms, Akai stated that it was &quot;like putting [his] face next to an anus and breathing deeply.&quot; Fans later became aware of his comments, and he announced his departure from the company he helped to found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-04-27/co-founder-takami-akai-steps-down-from-gainax| title=Co-Founder Takami Akai Steps Down From Gainax's Board|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=April 27, 2007|accessdate=2007-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pixar]] artist Grant Alexander reported that when he asked about the controversial animation of episode four, Gainax employee Hiromi Wakabayashi said &quot;...the fans were upset at the quality of animation, but it was completely intentional on the part of Imaishi (series director). He wanted to parody the common occurrence, in many productions of the past, to have huge dips in quality during the course of a show's TV production.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantalexander.blogspot.com/2011/02/gainax-at-pixar.html|title=Gainax at Pixar|author=Alexander, Grant|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|date=February 28, 2011|accessdate=March 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====
Four theme songs are used for the episodes; one opening theme and three ending themes. The opening theme is {{Nihongo|&quot;Sorairo Days&quot;|ç©ºè²ãã¤ãº|Sorairo Deizu|lit. &quot;Sky-Blue Days&quot;}} by [[Shoko Nakagawa]]. Starting from episode seventeen, the second verse and chorus was used, as compared to the first verse and chorus used in the previous episodes. For episodes one through fifteen the ending theme is &quot;Underground&quot; by High Voltage. &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; by [[Shoko Nakagawa]] was used in episode sixteen. {{Nihongo|&quot;Minna no Peace&quot;|ã¿ããªã®ãã¼ã¹|Minna no PÄ«su|&quot;Everyone's Peace&quot;}} by Afromania was used for episodes seventeen to twenty-seven.

''Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Character Song'' was released on July 25, 2007 by [[Aniplex]], including [[image song]]s by the main voice cast, with songs sung by [[Tetsuya Kakihara]] (Simon), [[Katsuyuki Konishi]] (Kamina), and [[Marina Inoue]] (Yoko), the latter of which is a playable song in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2]]''. In addition, several music compilation albums have been released, most consisting of [[background music]].

===Manga===
The ''Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann'' [[manga]], illustrated by Kotaro Mori, started serialization in the Japanese [[shÅnen]] magazine ''[[Dengeki Comic Gao!]]'' on April 27, 2007, published by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]. The manga ended serialization in ''Dengeki Comic Gao!'' on February 27, 2008 when the magazine was discontinued, but continued serialization in [[ASCII Media Works]]' manga magazine ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' on April 21, 2008. The first [[TankÅbon|bound volume]] was released on September 27, 2007 in Japan, containing the first five chapters, and is published under ASCII Media Works' ''[[Dengeki Comics]]'' label; the second volume followed on March 27, 2008. [[Bandai Entertainment]] licensed the manga and released it in English in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-26/bandai-entertainment-picks-up-gurren-lagann-manga|title=Bandai Entertainment Picks Up ''Gurren Lagann'' Manga| publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story of the manga follows the same plotline as the anime, however, there are several changes to the layout of events, and the addition of backstories that essentially fills in gaps from the anime, such as the relationship between Dayakka and Kiyoh.

A spin-off manga entitled {{Nihongo|''Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Gurren Gakuen-hen''|å¤©åçªç ´ã°ã¬ã³ã©ã¬ã³ âç´è®å­¦åç¯â}} started serialization in ''[[Comp Ace]]'' on August 26, 2008. The manga takes the characters from the original story and puts them in a school in a parallel world. In the manga, Simon attends {{Nihongo|Dai-Gurren Academy|ãã¤ã°ã¬ã³å­¦å|Dai Guren Gakuen}} with his friend Kamina, and childhood friend Yoko. Simon, who lives in a run down apartment building, wishes for a normal life, and meets the mysterious Nia one day when she trips down the stairs.

===Video games===
An online [[video game]] was developed by [[Konami]] called {{Nihongo|''Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann ChÅzetsu Hakkutsu ONLINE''|å¤©åçªç ´ã°ã¬ã³ã©ã¬ã³ è¶çµ¶çºæONLINE||literally &quot;''Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Superior Excavation Online&quot;}}. Beta testing had ended on April 16, 2007. The player takes up the role of a driller and drills for treasures in first person view. There is a shop to purchase drillsâthe shopkeeper is an original character named Asaki. The player can also collect digital trading cards. The game was canceled at the closed beta stage, as installing the game crashed [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] indefinitely. Konami even had to send out 500GB external hard drives to beta users so that they could back up files while reinstalling their operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theotaku.com/news/view/konami_hits_the_brakes_on_gurren_lagann_mmo/2579/|title=Konami Hits the Brakes on Gurren Lagann MMO|accessdate=2007-09-15|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20080221005549/http://www.theotaku.com/news/view/konami_hits_the_brakes_on_gurren_lagann_mmo/2579/|archivedate=2008-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konami.jp/gurren-lagann/online/notice.html|title=Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann game online service suspension notification|accessdate=2007-09-15|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A game for the [[Nintendo DS]] was released October 25, 2007, not only featuring the characters from the series, but also containing a special episode set in the early stages of the story as a pre-order bonus.

In June 2010, Gainax re-acquired the video game rights to the series from Konami, which allowed Banpresto to include it in the latest installment of its storied ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' franchise, ''2nd Super Robot Wars Z: Destruction Chapter'', set for release in April 2011.

[[Anime News Network]] gave ''Gurren Lagann'' a full 'A' rating, with reviewer Theron Martin describing it as &quot;one of the liveliest series of the decade&quot; and concluding that &quot;[[Gainax]]'s [[paean]] to boisterous, macho [[mecha]] action delivers in triumphant fashion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Gurren Lagann|author=Theron Martin|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=November 9, 2008|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/gurren-lagann/sub.dvd-3|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anime News Network also gave the dubbed version of the first volume an 'A' rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Gurren Lagann V1|author=Michelle Yu|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=October 7, 2009|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/gurren-lagann-v1|accessdate=2010-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] gave the series a score of 9.7 out of 10, with reviewer Ramsey Isler describing it as &quot;an inspiring story&quot; and concluding that &quot;overall it succeeds at being a great tale of the indomitable spirit of determined people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurren Lagann: Review|author=Ramsey Isler|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=November 11, 2008|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/929/929038p1.html|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anime World Order also gave the series a positive review, noting that it has become one of the most popular [[mecha anime]] on the internet, which reviewer Clarissa Graffeo ascribes to its crossover appeal among various audiences who do not usually watch giant robot anime, by combining aspects from a number of different anime genres, including elements of the [[Super Robot]], [[Real Robot]], [[ShÅnen]], [[ShÅjo]], [[Seinen manga|Seinen]] and [[Josei manga|Josei]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anime World Order Show #65 â Gurren-Lagann, Sojitz, and a .50 Cal Rampage|publisher=Anime World Order|date=2008.02.03|url=http://www.awopodcast.com/2008/02/anime-world-order-show-65-gurren-lagann.html|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

THEM Anime Reviews gave the anime a score of 4 out of 5 stars, with reviewer Tim Jones describing it as &quot;Almost five-star material,&quot; and stating that it is &quot;chuck full of [[Action (fiction)|action]], [[comedy]], [[Drama film|drama]], [[Adventure (genre)|adventure]], and [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] elements, managing to even entertain a person who couldn't care less about mecha in the process.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurren Lagann|publisher=Them Anime Reviews|url=http://themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1165|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK Anime Network gave the first third of the series a score of 8/10, with reviewer Ross Liversidge noting that from episode 7 onwards, &quot;the show's newfound edge makes it far more gripping,&quot; and concludes that it is a &quot;high quality release&quot; and &quot;a fun, punchy series that stands out from the crowd.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gurren Lagann Vol. 1|publisher=UK Anime Network|date=2009-06-22|url=http://www.uk-anime.net/anime/Gurren_Lagann_Vol._1.html|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the review website Mania.com, reviewer Chris Beveridge gave the first two-thirds of the series a full 'A' grade.

===Awards===
The ''Gurren Lagann'' anime series received an Excellence Prize at the 2007 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan Media Arts&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-12-04/coo-gurren-lagann-kafka-win-media-arts-awards | title=Coo, Gurren-Lagann, 'Kafka' Win Media Arts Awards | publisher=Anime News Networks | accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its director [[Hiroyuki Imaishi]] received an individual award for &quot;Personal Best&quot; at the 12th [[Animation Kobe]] Festival that same year for his work on the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;official blog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gainax.weblogs.jp/gurrenlagann/2007/11/post_7a5b.html|title=Gurren Lagann's official blog|publisher=[[Gainax]]|accessdate=2007-12-18|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the &quot;Best Character Design&quot; award was given to the character designer Atsushi Nishigori for his work on the anime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anime Fair&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-02-26/eva-1.0-wins-tokyo-anime-fair-animation-of-the-year| title=''Eva 1.0'' Wins Tokyo Anime Fair's Animation of the Year|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=February 26, 2008|accessdate= 2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
In an interview, the writer [[Kazuki Nakashima]] cites [[Ken Ishikawa]], co-creator of ''[[Getter Robo]]'', as one of ''Gurren Lagann'''s influences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Getter Robo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://img710.imageshack.us/i/1259714556574.jpg/|title=Interview with Kazuki Nakajima|accessdate=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gurren Lagann'' occasionally pays homage to Ishikawa's ''Getter Robo'', particularly towards the end of the series, where the scale becomes absurd, with the robots steadily becoming bigger and bigger, much like ''[[Getter Robo]]'' more specifically, the manga version of [[Getter Robo Go]]. The final enemy also bears a striking resemblance to La Gooth of ''Records of Nothingness'', another work by Ishikawa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tribute&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isiya.hamazo.tv/e1581434.html|title=å¤©åçªç ´ã°ã¬ã³ã©ã¬ã³|trans_title=Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann|author=Ishikawa, Ken|publisher=Hamazo|date=December 23, 2008|accessdate=July 13, 2010|language=Japanese}}&lt;!-- Replace this if possible. See http://isiya.hamazo.tv/robots.txt --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nakashima, however, wanted to conclude the story of ''Gurren Lagann'' in a more reasonable fashion than what Ishikawa usually does in his works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Getter Robo&quot;/&gt; According to Jason Green from [[Anime News Network]], the anime was influenced by previous [[Gainax]] anime, particularly in the character development of the protagonist [[Simon (Gurren Lagann)|Simon]], who goes through three stages in his character development during the three arcs of the series. Each of these stages in his development were influenced by protagonists from several previous Gainax anime: [[Shinji Ikari]] from the [[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' franchise]], Noriko Takaya from ''[[Gunbuster]]'', and Ken Kubo from ''[[Otaku no Video]]''.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Green|date=September 7, 2008|title=Dig For Fire: The Roots of Gurren Lagann|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2008-09-07|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular culture===
Influences from and references to ''Gurren Lagann'' can be found in several areas of recent [[popular culture]], ranging from Japanese [[anime]] and [[video game]]s, to [[American comic book|American comics]] and [[Anime-influenced animation|animation]], to [[Politics of Europe|politics in Europe]]. During a political debate over whether the British [[Union Flag]] should be updated by incorporating the [[Y Ddraig Goch|Welsh Dragon]], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper held a contest for readers to submit their designs and have other readers vote for the winning design. On December 11, 2007, a ''Gurren Lagann''-based design submitted from Norway won ''The Daily Telegraph'''s contest, winning by a wide margin of 55% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/11/nflag111.xml|title=The new face of Britain Flag poll results|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=December 11, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-11 | location=London | first=Matthew | last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-12-16/gurren-lagann-design-wins-informal-british-flag-poll|title=''Gurren Lagann'' Design Wins Informal British Flag Poll|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=December 16, 2007|accessdate=2007-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gurren Lagann'' has had an influence on the ''[[Transformers]]'' franchise, with the creators of ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' citing it as an inspiration. The art director and lead character designer Derrick Wyatt stated that, while he &quot;hadn't seen ''Gurren Lagann'' until after&quot; they &quot;had finished most of the first season of ''TFA'',&quot; he confirmed that the creators have &quot;definitely been inspired&quot; by it ever since, particularly during the second and third seasons of ''Transformers Animated''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preview of upcoming Transformers Animated characters|date=April 30, 2008|publisher=Transformers Animated|url=http://www.transformersanimated.com/news/7083/|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[List of Gurren Lagann mecha#Gurren|Gurren]] mecha made a cameo appearance in an issue of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis]]'', appearing as a [[Green Lantern]] construct of [[Kyle Rayner]]'s. The fifth episode of the 2010 anime series ''[[Baka to Test to ShÅkanjÅ«]]'' makes a reference to ''Gurren Lagann'' when the protagonist Yoshi shouts &quot;Pierce the heavens, Problem Break&quot; and throws his pencil like a drill. The influence of ''Gurren Lagann'' can also be seen in the character designs of [[Capcom]]'s [[adventure game]] ''[[Ghost Trick]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TGS 09: Like Ace Attorney?
