'''630 ABC North Queensland''' is an [[ABC Local Radio]] station based in [[Townsville]] broadcasting to [[North Queensland]]. This includes the towns of [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]], [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]], [[Ingham, Queensland|Ingham]] and [[Ayr, Queensland|Ayr]].

The station began broadcasting as '''4QN''' in 1936.  It was originally a relay station covering the whole of North Queensland with limited local news bulletins.  Local program content increased in the 1960s and the station was also the home of regional [[ABC Television (Australia)|ABC Television]] in Townsville, [[Cairns]] and [[Mount Isa]].

By the 1980s local program content was broadcast for most of the day, as well as a separate regional breakfast program.  4QN was also the headquarters of the regional network.

[[John Nutting]] launched the ''Saturday Night Country'' show in 1994 from 4QN which is now broadcast nationally.  The Townsville studios were also home to the first [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal and Islander]] broadcasting in [[Australia]].
