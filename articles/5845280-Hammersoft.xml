'''Warner Channel''' (commonly shortened to '''WBTV''', but not to be confused with [[the WB Television Network]] or [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] station [[WBTV]], and currently referred to in promos as simply '''Warner''' in Latin America and '''WarnerTV''' in Asia) is a [[Latin America]]n and [[Asia]]n [[cable television]] channel owned by [[Time Warner]]'s [[HBO Asia]]/[[HBO Latin America Group]] (as a joint venture with sister company [[Warner Bros.]]) that focuses on airing [[United States|American]]-produced series and films. Most of the shows air in their original [[English language]] audio, with subtitles in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (for Latin American Countries), [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (for Brazil), [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (For Taiwan and Hong Kong),  [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] (For Malaysia) and [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]] (For Indonesia), but there are also some [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] shows.

Warner Channel headquarters are located in [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]; the broadcasting, however, is generated in [[Miami]] for Latin American and Singapore for Asian Channel.

Most, but not all, series that air on the channel are in the Warner Bros. library.
