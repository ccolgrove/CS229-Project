'''GTV''' (General Television Corporation) is a commercial [[television station]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] owned by the [[Nine Network]].  The station is currently based at a new high-tech, purpose-built studios at 717 Bourke Street, [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]].

==History==
[[Image:GTV9 3.jpg|thumb|left|GTV-9 former premises in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]]]
GTV was amongst the first TV stations to begin regular transmission in [[Australia]]. Test transmissions began on 27 September 1956, introduced by former [[Mix 101.1|3DB]] radio announcer Geoff Corke, based at the Dandenong transmitter, as the studios in Richmond were not yet ready.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoff Corke interview by Keith McGowan of 3AW&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; The station was officially opened on 19 January 1957&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;You, Me and Gerry Gee&quot;'' by Ron Blaskett, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; by Victorian Governor 
[[Dallas Brooks|Sir Dallas Brooks]] from the studios in Bendigo Street, Richmond. A clip from the ceremony has featured in a number of GTV retrospectives, in which the Governor advises viewers that if they don't like the programs, they can just turn off.

''&quot;If you don't like what you see or it quite frankly bores you, simply switch the dial to off.&quot;''

[[Image:GTV9 1.jpg|thumb|right|GTV former front gate]]
The Richmond building, bearing the name ''Television City'', had been converted from a [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] tinned food factory, also occupied in the past by the [[Wertheim Piano]] Company (from 1908â1935).&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/bendigo-street-to-fade-to-black-20100225-p5zr.html Bendigo St to fade to black] - The Age 25-02-2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2010/02/television-city-was-australias-hollywood.html Television City was Australia's Hollywood] - TV Tonight&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; A cornerstone, now visible from the staff canteen courtyard, was laid when construction of the Piano factory began.

Soon after the station's launch, [[Sir Eric Pearce|Eric Pearce]] was appointed to read the news, a position held for almost twenty years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} In 1957, GTV-9's first large-scale production was the nightly variety show ''[[In Melbourne Tonight]]'' (''&quot;IMT&quot;''), hosted by [[Graham Kennedy]].  Kennedy was a radio announcer at [[3UZ]] in Melbourne before being 'discovered' by GTV-9 producer [[Norm Spencer]], when appearing on a GTV telethon.  [[Bert Newton]] moved from [[HSV-7]] to join Kennedy. ''IMT'' continued for thirteen years, dominating Melbourne's television scene for most of that time. It set a precedent for a number of subsequent live variety programmes from the station.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} 

Ownership has changed over the decades. The station was first licensed to the ''General Television Corporation Ltd.'', a consortium of two newspapers, [[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]] and [[The Age]], together with cinema chains [[Hoyts]], [[Greater Union]], Sir Arthur Warner's Electronic Industries, JC William's Theatres, Cinesound Productions, and radio stations [[3XY]], [[3UZ]], [[3KZ]]. In early 1957 The Argus was acquired by [[The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd]], and the paper was closed on the same day that GTV officially opened. The Herald in turn sold its interests in the station to Electronic Industries, later acquired by UK television manufacturer [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]], in 1960.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Because of the restriction on foreign ownership of television stations, GTV-9 was then sold to [[Frank Packer]]'s [[Australian Consolidated Press]], which already owned [[TCN-9]] in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]], resulting in the formation of the country's first commercially owned television network.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Prior to this GTV-9 was affiliated with [[ATN|ATN-7]] in Sydney.  Son [[Clyde Packer]] ran the network for some time, until a falling out led to a handover to younger son [[Kerry Packer]]. In the 1980s the network was sold to [[Alan Bond (businessman)|Alan Bond]], but later bought back at a much lower price.&lt;ref name=&quot;Age-obit&quot;&gt;
Packer was reported as saying &quot;You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I've had mine&quot;
{{cite news |work=The Age |date=28 December 2005 |page=7 |title=Kerry Francis Bullmore Packer 1937â2005 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/12/27/1135445572500.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the death of [[Kerry Packer]], his son [[James Packer]] progressively sold down his stake in the network. (See also [[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]].)

Along with most Australian TV stations, GTV-9 commenced [[colour television|colour]] test transmissions in October, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionau.com/tv071074.htm |publisher=televisionau.com |title=The history of Australian television - Classic TV Guides |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official changeover took place at 12.00am on Saturday 1 March 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.televisionau.com/tv280275.htm |publisher=televisionau.com |title=The history of Australian television - Classic TV Guides |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1976 GTV became the first Melbourne television station to commence permanent 24 hour transmission.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} In 2001 the station commenced [[Digital terrestrial television in Australia|digital television]] broadcasting, in line with most other metropolitan stations. GTV continued broadcasting in analogue on [[VHF]]9, with a digital simulcast on [[very high frequency|VHF]]8.

In 2010 it was announced to public and then staff, that after 54 years at Bendigo Street, GTV9 would move day to day operations including News and commercial sales to 717 Bourke Street, Docklands. On the 25th of October 2010 it was announced that GTV9 will record larger scale studio production, such as The Footy Show, Hey Hey its Saturday, and Millionaire Hotseat from the new [[Docklands Studios Melbourne]]. Stage 4 will become home to all GTV9 productions, before moving into a refurbished Sound Stage 5 in twelve months time.&lt;ref name=HeraldSun14Nov&gt;{{cite web

=== Former News Presenters ===
[[Sir Eric Pearce|Eric Pearce]], who was knighted after his retirement, was GTV-9's chief news presenter from 1957 until 1974. After his first retirement, the subsequent American style  ''&quot;News Centre Nine&quot;'' presented by Peter Hitchener did not rate well, so Pearce returned to the helm in 1976, remaining until 1978.

In 1979, former [[HSV-7]] news presenter [[Brian Naylor (broadcaster)|Brian Naylor]] joined as GTV-9's chief weeknight news presenter, with Hitchener on weekends. Naylor's association with Nine lasted 19 years - he retired at the end of 1998, with Naylor replaced by then deputy news presenter [[Peter Hitchener]]. [[Jo Hall]] took over on weekends, with [[Tony Jones (sports journalist)|Tony Jones]] the main weekend fill-in.

Other main presenters of ''[[Nine News|Nine News Melbourne]]'' included [[Tracy Grimshaw]] (1981â1993), who has since moved to ''[[A Current Affair]]'' and [[Tracey Curro]], who also worked on Nine's ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' and [[Jo Hall]] (1998-2011). 

Past weekend sport presenters in recent years have included [[Leith Mulligan]] (1999-2006), [[Heath O'Loughlin]] (2006-2008), [[Grant Hackett]] (2008-2009) and Lisa Andrews (2009-2011). [[Rob Gell]] was the previous weather presenter he held the position for fifteen years from 1988 to 2004.
