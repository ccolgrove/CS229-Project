'''Near field communication''', or '''NFC''', allows for simplified transactions, data exchange, and wireless connections between two devices in proximity to each other, usually by no more than a few centimeters.&lt;ref name=WhatIsNFC&gt;{{cite web |title=What is NFC?|url=http://www.nfc-forum.org/aboutnfc/|publisher=NFC Forum|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to become a widely used system for making payments by smartphone in the United States. Many smartphones currently on the market already contain embedded NFC chips that can send encrypted data a short distance (&quot;near field&quot;) to a reader located, for instance, next to a retail cash register. Shoppers who have their credit card information stored in their NFC smartphones can pay for purchases by waving their smartphones near or tapping them on the reader, rather than using the actual credit card. Co-invented by [[NXP Semiconductors]] and [[Sony]] in 2002, NFC technology is being added to a growing number of mobile handsets to enable mobile payments, as well as many other applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = NXP Shows RFID is Coming of Age | url = http://www.rfidjournal.com/blog/entry/8664 | title = RFID Journal | date = August 1, 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though contactless or proximity cards are in use, their market penetration is limited, and bringing NFC to mobiles and other similar platforms may increase usage. NFC cannot be labeled a ânewâ technology, as Nokia has been active in this line since 2004. Along with Philips and Sony, it has founded the NFC Forum. Participation of 130 countries in this forum clearly signals that NFC is set to become a way of life in the years to come.

The Near Field Communication Forum (NFC Forum) formed in 2004 promotes sharing, pairing, and transactions between NFC devices&lt;ref name=PopSciNFC&gt;{{cite web|last=Nosowitz|first=Dan|title=Everything You Need to Know About Near Field Communication |url= http://www.popsci.com/gadgets/article/2011-02/near-field-communication-helping-your-smartphone-replace-your-wallet-2010/ | work= Popular Science Magazine| publisher= Popular Science|accessdate= 14 June 2011 | date= 1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and develops and certifies device compliance with NFC standards.&lt;ref name=NFCForum&gt;{{cite web|title=The NFC Forum| url =http://www.nfc-forum.org/aboutus/|publisher=NFC Forum|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[smartphone]] or [[Tablet computer |tablet]] with an NFC chip could make a [[credit card]] payment or serve as  [[Keycard lock| keycard]] or [[Identity document |ID card]]. NFC devices can also read unpowered NFC tags,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gadgetronica.com/blog/near-field-communication.html | title=NFC - future of wireless communication| author= Nikhila | date=October 26, 2011 | publisher = Gadgetronica}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example on a museum or retail display. NFC can share a contact, photo, song, application, or video, or pair [[Bluetooth]] devices.

== History ==

NFC traces its roots back to [[Radio-frequency identification]], or RFID. RFID allows a reader to send radio waves to a passive electronic tag for identification and tracking.

== Essential specifications ==
NFC is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically requiring a distance of 4&amp;nbsp;cm or less. NFC operates at 13.56â¯[[MHz]] on ISO/IEC 18000-3 air interface and at rates ranging from 106 kbit/s to 424 kbit/s. NFC always involves an initiator and a target; the initiator actively generates an [[Radio frequency|RF]] field that can power a passive target. This enables NFC targets to take very simple form factors such as tags, stickers, key fobs, or cards that do not require batteries. NFC peer-to-peer communication is possible, provided both devices are powered.&lt;ref name=PopSciNFC /&gt; A patent licensing program for NFC is currently under development by Via Licensing Corporation, an independent subsidiary of [[Dolby Laboratories]]. A public, platform-independent NFC library is released under the free [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] by the name libnfc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.libnfc.org/ | title = LibNFC}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

NFC tags contain data and are typically read-only but may be rewriteable. They can be custom-encoded by their manufacturers or use the specifications provided by the NFC Forum, an industry association charged with promoting the technology and setting key standards. The tags can securely store personal data such as debit and credit card information, loyalty program data, PINs and networking contacts, among other information. The NFC Forum defines four types of tags which provide different communication speeds and capabilities in terms of configurability, memory, security, data retention and write endurance. Tags currently offer between 96 and 4,096 bytes of memory.

*As with [[proximity card]] technology, near-field communication uses [[magnetic field|magnetic]] [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] between two [[loop antenna]]s located within each other's [[Near and far field|near field]], effectively forming an air-core [[transformer]]. It operates within the globally available and unlicensed [[radio frequency]] [[ISM band]] of 13.56â¯MHz. Most of the RF energy is concentrated in the allowed 14&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth range, but the full spectral envelope may be as wide as 1.8&amp;nbsp;MHz when using [[Amplitude-shift keying|ASK]] modulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = C | last = Patauner | author-display = 1 | url = http://www.eurasip.org/Proceedings/Ext/RFID2007/pdf/s1p4.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | contribution = High Speed RFID/NFC at the Frequency of 13.56â¯MHz | title = EuraSIP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Theoretical working distance with compact standard antennas: up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm (practical working distance of about 4 centimetres)
*Supported data rates: 106, 212 or 424 [[kbit/s]] (the  bit rate 848 kbit/s is not compliant with the standard ISO/IEC 18092)
*There are two modes:
** Passive communication mode: The initiator device provides a carrier fields and the target device answers by modulating the existing field. In this mode, the target device may draw its operating power from the initiator-provided electromagnetic field, thus making the target device a [[transponder]].
** Active communication mode: Both initiator and target device communicate by alternately generating their own fields. A device deactivates its RF field while it is waiting for data. In this mode, both devices typically have power supplies.

* NFC employs two different [[coding]]s to transfer data. If an active device transfers data at 106 kbit/s, a modified [[Miller coding]] with 100% [[modulation]] is used. In all other cases [[Manchester coding]] is used with a modulation ratio of 10%.
* NFC devices are able to receive and transmit data at the same time. Thus, they can check for potential collisions if the received signal frequency does not match with the transmitted signalâs frequency.

NFC and Bluetooth are both short-range communication technologies which are integrated into mobile phones. As described in technical detail below, NFC operates at slower speeds than Bluetooth, but consumes far less power and doesnât require pairing.

NFC sets up faster than standard Bluetooth, but is not faster than [[Bluetooth low energy]].  With NFC, instead of performing manual configurations to identify devices, the connection between two NFC devices is automatically established quickly: in less than a tenth of a second. The maximum data transfer rate of NFC (424 kbit/s) is slower than that of Bluetooth V2.1 (2.1 Mbit/s). With a maximum working distance of less than 20&amp;nbsp;cm, NFC has a shorter range, which reduces the likelihood of unwanted interception. That makes NFC particularly suitable for crowded areas where correlating a signal with its transmitting physical device (and by extension, its user) becomes difficult.

In contrast to Bluetooth, NFC is compatible with existing passive RFID (13.56&amp;nbsp;MHz ISO/IEC 18000-3) infrastructures. NFC requires comparatively low power, similar to the Bluetooth V4.0 low energy protocol. However, when NFC works with an unpowered device (e.g. on a phone that may be turned off, a contactless smart credit card, a smart poster, etc.), the NFC power consumption is greater than that of Bluetooth V4.0 Low Energy, this is because illuminating the passive tag needs extra power.

== Standardization bodies and industry projects ==

=== Standards ===

NFC was approved as an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard on December 8, 2003 and later as an [[European Computer Manufacturers Association|ECMA]] standard.

NFC is an open platform technology standardized in ECMA-340 and ISO/IEC 18092. These standards specify the modulation schemes, coding, transfer speeds and frame format of the RF interface of NFC devices, as well as initialization schemes and conditions required for data collision-control during initialization for both passive and active NFC modes. Furthermore, they also define the [[transport protocol]], including protocol activation and data-exchange methods.  The air interface for NFC is standardized in:
;ISO/IEC 18092 / ECMA-340: ''Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol-1'' (NFCIP-1)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-340.htm Ecma International: Standard ECMA-340, Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol (NFCIP-1)], December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
;ISO/IEC 21481 / ECMA-352: ''Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol-2'' (NFCIP-2)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-352.htm Ecma International: Standard ECMA-352, Near Field Communication Interface and Protocolâ2 (NFCIP-2)], December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

NFC incorporates a variety of existing standards including [[ISO/IEC 14443]] both Type A and Type B, and [[FeliCa]].  NFC enabled phones work basically, at least, with existing readers.  Especially in &quot;card emulation mode&quot; a NFC device should transmit, at a minimum, a unique ID number to an existing reader.

In addition, the [[NFC Forum]] has defined a common data format called NFC Data Exchange Format ([http://www.nfc-forum.org/specs/ NDEF]), which can store and transport various kinds of items, ranging from any [[MIME]]-typed object to ultra-short RTD-documents,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfc-forum.org/specs/ NFC-forum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Uniform Resource Locator|URLs]].

The [[NFC Forum]] added the [[Simple NDEF Exchange Protocol]] to the spec which allows sending and receiving messages between two NFC-enabled devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/09/29/nfc.revision.allows.peer.to.peer.message.sending/#ixzz1Zuj6DGxH  Electronista Article: New NFC spec lets two phones swap messages], October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GSMA ===

The [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM Association (GSMA)]]  is the global trade association representing nearly 800 mobile phone operators and more than 200 product and service companies across 219 countries. Many of its members have led NFC trials around the world and are now preparing services for commercial launch.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSMA press release&quot;&gt;World's leading mobile operators announce commitment to NFC technology, GSMA press release, corporate website, February 21, 2011.[http://gsmworld.com/newsroom/press-releases/2011/6057.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

GSM is involved with several initiatives:
* Standard setting: GSMA is developing certification and testing standards to ensure the global interoperability of NFC services.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSMA press release&quot;/&gt;
* The '''Pay-Buy-Mobile initiative''' seeks to define a common global approach to using Near Field Communications (NFC) technology to link mobile devices with payment and contactless systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsmworld.com/newsroom/press-releases/1990.htm#nav-6 GSM Association Aims For Global Point Of Sale Purchases by Mobile Phone], ''GSM Association'', 13 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsmworld.com/news/press_2007/press07_33.shtml Momentum Builds Around GSMA's Pay-Buy Mobile Project], ''GSM Association'', 25 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 17, 2010, after two years of discussions, AT&amp;T, Verizon and T-Mobile launched a joint venture intended to develop a single platform on which technology based on the Near Field Communication (NFC) specifications can be used by their customers to make mobile payments. The new venture, known as [http://www.paywithisis.com/ ISIS], is designed to usher in the broad deployment of NFC technology, allowing NFC-enabled cell phones to function similarly to credit cards for the 200 million customers using cell phone service provided by any of the three carriers throughout the United States.

=== StoLPaN ===

StoLPaN (âStore Logistics and Payment with NFCâ) is a pan-European consortium supported by the [[European Commission]]âs [[Information Society Technologies]] program. StoLPaN will examine the as yet untapped potential for the new kind of local wireless interface, NFC and mobile communication.

=== NFC Forum ===

The NFC Forum is a non-profit industry association formed on March 18, 2004, by [[NXP Semiconductors]], [[Sony]] and [[Nokia]] to advance the use of NFC short-range wireless interaction in consumer electronics, mobile devices and PCs. The NFC Forum promotes implementation and standardization of NFC technology to ensure interoperability between devices and services. As of March 2011, the NFC Forum had 135 member companies.&lt;ref&gt;Near Field Communication Forum Announces 32 New Members, NFC Forum Press Release, March 31, 2011.[http://www.nfc-forum.org/news/pr/view?item_key=56897139ae16c4bc8240498410069bdb8044c098]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative Form Factors ===

To realize the benefits of NFC in cellphones not yet equipped with built in NFC chips a new line of complementary devices were created. MicroSD and UICC SIM cards were developed to incorporate industry standard contactless smartcard chips with ISO14443 interface, with or without built-in antenna. The microSD and SIM form factors with built-in antenna have the great potential as bridge devices to shorten the time to market of contactless payment and couponing applications, while the built in NFC contollers gain enough market share.

=== Other standardization bodies ===

Other standardization bodies that are involved in NFC include:
* [[ETSI]] / SCP (Smart Card Platform) to specify the interface between the SIM card and the NFC chipset.
* [[GlobalPlatform]] to specify a multi-application architecture of the secure element.
* [[EMV]]Co for the impacts on the EMV payment applications

== Security aspects ==

Although the communication range of NFC is limited to a few centimeters, NFC alone does not ensure secure communications. In 2006, Ernst Haselsteiner and Klemens BreitfuÃ described different possible types of attacks, and detail how to leverage NFC's resistance to [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]s to establish a specific key.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haselsteiner, Klemens BreitfuÃ: {{PDFlink|[http://events.iaik.tugraz.at/RFIDSec06/Program/papers/002%20-%20Security%20in%20NFC.pdf Security in near field communication (NFC)]|158&amp;nbsp;KB}}, ''[[Philips Semiconductors]]'', Printed handout of Workshop on RFID Security RFIDSec 06, July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, as this technique is not part of the ISO standard, NFC offers no protection against eavesdropping and can be vulnerable to data modifications. Applications may use higher-layer [[cryptographic protocol]]s (e.g., [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]]) to establish a secure channel. Ensuring security for NFC data will require the cooperation of multiple parties: device providers, who will need to safeguard NFC-enabled phones with strong cryptography and authentication protocols; customers, who will need to protect their personal devices and data with passwords, keypad locks, and anti-virus software; and application providers and transaction parties, who will need to use anti-virus and other security solutions to prevent spyware and malware from infecting systems.&lt;ref&gt;Harley Geiger, [http://www.cdt.org/blogs/harley-geiger/nfc-phones-raise-opportunities-privacy-and-security-issues NFC Phones Raise Opportunities, Privacy and Security Issues], Center for Democracy and Technology, April 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eavesdropping ===
The RF signal for the wireless data transfer can be picked up with antennas. The distance from which an attacker is able to eavesdrop the RF signal depends on numerous parameters, but is typically a small number of metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Gerhard P | last = Hancke | url = http://www.rfidblog.org.uk/research.html#eavesdrop2008 | contribution = Eavesdropping Attacks on High-Frequency RFID Tokens | title = 4th Workshop on RFID Security (RFIDsec'08) | pages = 100â13 | date = July 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, eavesdropping is highly affected by the communication mode.  A passive device that doesn't generate its own RF field is much harder to eavesdrop on than an active device. One [[open source]] device that is able to eavesdrop on passive and active NFC communications is the Proxmark instrument&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.proxmark.org/ | title = Proxmark}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Data modification ===

It is relatively easy to destroy data by using an RFID jammer. There is no way currently to prevent such an attack. However, if NFC devices check the RF field while they are sending, it is possible to detect attacks.

It is much more difficult to modify data in such a way that it appears to be valid to users. To modify transmitted data, an intruder has to deal with the single bits of the RF signal. The feasibility of this attack, (i.e., if it is possible to change the value of a bit from 0 to 1 or the other way around), is amongst others subject to the strength of the [[amplitude modulation]]. If data is transferred with the modified [[Miller coding]] and a modulation of 100%, only certain bits can be modified. A modulation ratio of 100% makes it possible to eliminate a pause of the RF signal, but not to generate a pause where no pause has been. Thus, only a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; which is followed by another &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; might be changed. Transmitting Manchester-encoded data with a modulation ratio of 10% permits a modification attack on all bits.

=== Relay attack ===

Because NFC devices usually include ISO/IEC 14443 protocols, the relay attacks described are also feasible on NFC.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard P. Hancke:[http://www.rfidblog.org.uk/research.html#relay A practical relay attack on ISO/IEC 14443 proximity cards], February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Timo Kasper et al.&quot;&gt;Timo Kasper et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For this attack the adversary has to forward the request of the reader to the victim and relay back its answer to the reader in real time, in order to carry out a task pretending to be the owner of the victimâs smart card. One of [http://www.libnfc.org/ libnfc] code examples demonstrates a [http://www.libnfc.org/documentation/examples/nfc-relay/ relay attack] using only two stock commercial NFC devices.

=== Lost property ===

Losing the NFC RFID card or the mobile phone will open access to any finder and act as a single-factor authenticating entity. Mobile phones protected by a PIN code acts as a single authenticating factor. A way to defeat the lost-property threat requires an extended security concept that includes more than one physically independent authentication factor.

=== Walk-off ===

Lawfully opened access to a secure NFC function or data is protected by time-out closing after a period of inactivity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}{{Or|date=July 2011}}  Attacks may happen despite provisions to shutdown access NFC after the bearer has become inactive. The known concepts described primarily do not address the geometric distance of a fraudulent attacker using a lost communication entity against lawful access from the actual location of the registered bearer. Additional feature to cover such attack scenario dynamically shall make use of a second wireless authentication factor that remains with the bearer in case of lost NFC communicator. Relevant approaches are described as an [[electronic leash]] or its equivalent, a ''wireless key.''

== Future devices ==
On January 25, 2011, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] published a report stating that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] was actively pursuing development of a mobile payment system employing NFC. New generations of iPhone, iPod and iPad products would reportedly be equipped with NFC capability which would enable small-scale monetary transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Bloomberg | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-25/apple-plans-service-that-lets-iphone-users-pay-with-handsets.html | title = Apple plans service that lets iPhone users pay with headsets | type = news | date = 2011-1-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near Field Communications World stated on March 21, 2011 that [[Sonim Technologies]] will add NFC to its XP3300 Force&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sonimtech.com/products/xp3300force.php | publisher = Sonimtech | title = Products | contribution = XP3300 Force}}.&lt;/ref&gt; device later this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nearfieldcommunicationsworld.com/2011/03/21/36530/sonim-to-add-nfc-to-xp3300-force-rugged-handset/ | publisher = Near Field Communications World | date = 2011-3-21 | title = Sonim to Add NFC to XP3300 Force rugged handset}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Google announced [[Google Wallet]], an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application that will make use of NFC to make payments at stores. The card information will be stored in the app and will be used to make the transactions.

== Project trials and full-scale deployments ==
Several hundred NFC trials have been conducted to date. While NFC trials continue, some firms have moved to full-scale service deployments, spanning either a single country or multiple countries. As a consequence, programs listed below date from 2010 forward and are cited for ease-of-reference. Programs were updated through April 2011.
