===Music video===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2007}}
The music video was handdrawn, and was a series of still drawings. In the video, the four members of Mew were on board a ship, along with their captain, an elephant. The captain orders two of the bandmembers ([[Jonas Bjerre]] and [[Silas Utke Graae JÃ¸rgensen]]) to rob a house on the shore. They take off towards the shore in a little boat. The elephant uses his telescope to see a young woman in a house, who he falls in love with. He shouts at the two bandmembers to come back, but they can't hear him. They reach the shore and enter the house, but as they enter, they knock over a vase. The girl wakes up upon hearing this, and flees the house. When Jonas and Silas return to the ship with the stolen goods, the elephant wanted to know happened to the girl. As he goes to sleep, he has a nightmare in which he sees the four bandmembers in the girl's house, trapping her and setting the house alight, killing the girl. The elephant wakes up, takes the stolen goods, and throws them overboard, convinced that the bandmembers killed the girl. In the chorus of the video, the bandmembers' actual bodies, though with the animated heads, can be seen playing their instruments. The artwork of this video is based on &quot;Skibber Bee Bye&quot;, a comic book by ([[Ron RegÃ© Jr.]]).

===Music video===
The accompanying music video was directed by [[Martin de Thurah]] and filmed at a castle in [[GÃ¤rnÃ¤s]], Sweden. The darkly atmospheric video is shot in black and white, and features intensively [[low-key lighting]] as well as special effects.  It begins with a woman in a white dress rising from the water. The scene then changes to the inside of the castle, where a bearded man in a suit is dancing absurdly. The two people begin dancing in the lake, by the lakeside, and in the castle's courtyard. Clips of the band performing the song on a field can be seen, as well as shots of lead singer Jonas Bjerre, where one half of his face is shrouded in darkness. The couple is seen dancing in the courtyard between tables with glasses and wine bottles. At one point, the man throws the woman, and she soars through the courtyard. Near the end of the video, the woman becomes angry at the man, slaps him in the face, and leaps into the lake again. The video ends with the man jumping into the lake as well.

Special placed second on Danish music magazine ''[[Gaffa (magazine)|Gaffa's]]'' top 5 Hits of 2005 list. In first place was fellow track [[The Zookeeper's Boy]], which hadn't even been released as a single yet, and wouldn't be until 17 April 2006.

&quot;'''Introducing Palace Players'''&quot; is a song by the Danish band [[Mew (band)|Mew]].  It was the first single to be released from their fifth studio album ''[[No More Stories...]]'', and was posted on their MySpace page on 28 May 2009.  It features [[Swirlies]] frontman and guitarist Damon Tutunjian on bass guitar.

===Music video===

The official music video for ''Introducing Palace Players'' was released via AOL Spinner on 29 July 2009. It was directed by award-winning director [[Martin de Thurah]], Adam Hashemi and Lasse Martinussen. It was shot in Denmark in various locations, most notably the forests.

The video opens with scenes of a forest. The song starts as strange black boxes slowly begin to emerge from the foliage. One of them hovers slowly in the air before shooting pink rays of light throughout its surroundings. It continues to do so as it progresses towards an unspecified destination, as various shots of nature and wildlife are shown. Once, as it comes across a vacant [[Volvo]], the box causes it to flash its light in response to its actions. Various other scenes are shown after that, including one of a playground, and of the surrounding wildlife.  The scene then changes to a pond; another black box rises from the dark depths of the water. Another box rises somewhere, covered all over in snails. Far away, at a local gas station a dog digs up another black box from the dirt. The boxes then are revealed to be all heading towards in the same direction; they are all headed towards a large object in the distance. The object turns out to be a mountain, slowly being built upon by the strange black boxes. The video ends upon the boxes joining and becoming one.

The video is the first of three videos; the sequels are to be the videos for &quot;Repeaterbeater&quot; and &quot;Beach.&quot;
