==History==
===Launch===
This station received its original [[construction permit]] for a new 1,000 [[watt]] AM station broadcasting at 1000 [[kHz]] from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] on July 25, [[1984 in radio|1984]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fccp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=67241 |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BP-19840306AA) |date=July 25, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new station was assigned the call letters '''WXWY''' by the FCC.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=50377&amp;Callsign=WBZR |title=Call Sign History |publisher=FCC Media Bureau CDBS Public Access Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WXWY received its [[broadcast license|license to cover]] from the FCC on April 30, 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;flic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=77219 |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BL-19850328AA) |date=April 30, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale to Bowen===
In December 1993, Opal Carrol Coley reached an agreement to sell this station to Bowen Broadcasting, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on January 19, 1994, and the transaction was eventually consummated on August 2, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19931206EI) |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=192672 |date=August 2, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a complication arose and the license reverted back to Coley.  In June 1995, Opal Carrol Coley reached another agreement to sell this station, this time to JTL Broadcasting.  The deal was approved by the FCC on October 26, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on November 15, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details () |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=210813 |date=November 15, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1999, JTL Broadcasting reached an agreement to sell this station to Gulf Coast Broadcasting Company, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on May 19, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on June 9, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19990318GF) |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=282966 |date=June 9, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 16, 1999, the new owners had the FCC assign new call letters '''WDXZ''' for &quot;Dixie&quot; to match the station's [[country music]] format.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;/&gt;

In February 2001, Gulf Coast Broadcasting Company, Inc. (R. Lee Hagan, principal) reached an agreement to sell this station to Great American Radio Network, Inc. ([http://radiofacts.com/tag/walter-john-bowen Walter J. Bowen], owner) for a reported sale price of $180,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |title=AMs - 2001-03-05 |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/92945-AMs.php?q=WPGG |date=March 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was approved by the FCC on March 16, 2001, and the transaction was consummated on August 24, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=551275 |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-20010130AAR) |date=August 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WNSI years===
The station was assigned the '''WNSI''' call letters by the FCC on April 6, 2004, after a swap with a [[sister station]] in preparation for a switch from country music to [[news/talk]] on June 4, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mpr1&quot;/&gt;

In March 2006, Great American Radio Network, Inc. (Walter Bowen, president) announced an agreement to sell WNSI along with sister stations [[WNSI-FM]] and [[WTOF|WBCA]] to Gulf Coast Broadcasting Inc. (R. Lee Hagan, president) for a reported combined sale price of $550,001.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=April 10, 2006 |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/91473-Deals.php |work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable |title=Deals - 2006-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement, WNSI aired a sports/talk radio format.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc2&quot;/&gt; The deal was dismissed at the request of the applicants on May 17, 2006, and the transaction was never consummated so the license remained with Great American Radio Network Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-20060323AEA) |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=1121419 |date=May 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition by Gulf Coast Broadcasting===
In March 2010, the broadcast license for WNSI was involuntarily transferred from Great American Radio Network, Inc., to Lonnie L. Mixon, acting as the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BALH-20100212AAC) |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=1356359 |date=March 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The station was assigned new call letters '''WBZR''' by the FCC on May 4, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;/&gt; In July 2010, the trustee reached an agreement to sell WBZR to Gulf Coast Broadcasting Company, Inc., for $190,000 in settlement of the owner's debts.&lt;ref name=&quot;29aed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-20100329AED) |url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=1361363 |date=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This bankruptcy sale, along with [[sister station]] WBZR-FM, for a combined price of $410,000 is at a significantly reduced from the March 2006 agreement with Gulf Coast for $550,001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=''Radio &amp; Television Business'' |title=Sale of distressed Alabama pair comes to a close |url=http://www.rbr.com/radio/radio_deals/28064.html |date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sale was formally consummated on September 27, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;29aed&quot;/&gt;

==Controversy==
Former owner Walter Bowen made national headlines in 2008 due to a dispute over music licensing with the [[performance rights organization]] known as the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mpr1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Brendan |last=Kirby |work=Mobile Press-Register |title=Baldwin radio stations in tussle over copyrights |url=http://www.al.com/news/press-register/index.ssf?/base/news/1211966116283360.xml&amp;coll=3 |date=May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WNSI and WNSI-FM combo does not itself play musicâthe clips at issue were played during the syndicated ''Dave Ramsey Show''âand hasn't since a June 2004 switch from [[country music]] to [[talk radio]].  Bowen, upset by ASCAP's refusal to reduce his licensing fee from about $80 per month to the talk radio rate of $17 per month, stopped paying the fee altogether.  Citing the airing of two song clips in September 2006 on the Ramsey program, ASCAP sued Bowen's Great American Radio Network, Inc., for damages.  Bowen's attorneys and ASCAP reached a $15,000 settlement with a payment plan but Bowen refused to pay, calling the settlement &quot;legal extortion&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mpr1&quot;/&gt;

In September, 2010, Bowen was again in the headlines when he was convicted of sex abuse in 2009 with a child under the age of 12. He was sentenced to 10 years in an Alabama state penitentiary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.baldwincountynow.com/articles/2010/10/17/local_news/doc4ca4db61e36c5050029729.txt|title=Radio personality sentenced in child sex abuse case|publisher=Baldwin County Now|accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
