'''Microsoft Schedule Plus''' (or '''Microsoft Schedule+''') was a [[time management]] software product developed by [[Microsoft]], but was discontinued as part of Microsoft Office when most of its functionality was incorporated into [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook 97]]. It was originally intended as a companion to [[Microsoft Mail]], but later it was a companion to [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] and was part of [[Microsoft Office 95]], and later [[Microsoft Exchange Client]] and [[Windows Messaging]], so it was later included and developed as part of [[Microsoft Exchange Server]], which resulted in version 7.5 of Schedule+ as part of Exchange Server 5.0. The &quot;Outlook Calendar&quot; that was part of Outlook for Windows 3.1 and Macintosh versions before 9.0 was actually a new version of Schedule+. In spite of being discontinued, the software, however, is still included with all versions of [[Microsoft Office]] up to Microsoft Office 2003, although it is just to support conversion from Schedule+ 1.x. It is not available in Office 2007, although it was present in early test builds.

== Versions ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Office 95 Pro.jpg|thumb|200px|Microsoft Schedule+ included in [[Office 95]]]] --&gt;
Versions for [[Microsoft Windows]] include:

* 1992: Schedule+ 1.0 for Windows 3.11 and Mac
* 1995: Schedule+ 7 for Windows 95 (Office 95) and Mac
* 1996: Schedule+ 7.5 (Office 97 and higher)

''Note'': There are no Schedule+ 2.0 to 6.0, because the Windows 95 version was launched with Word 7. All the Office 95 products have [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] 2 capacity â moving data automatically from various programs â and Schedule+ '''7''' should show that it was contemporary with Word '''7'''.
