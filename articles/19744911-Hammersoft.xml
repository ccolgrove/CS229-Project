'''Euro gold and silver commemorative coins''' are special [[euro coins]] [[Mint (coin)|minted]] and issued by member states of the [[Eurozone]], mainly in [[gold]] and [[silver]], although other [[precious metal]]s are also used in rare occasions. [[Greece]] was one of the first twelve countries in the Eurozone that introduced the [[Euro|euro (â¬)]] on 1&amp;nbsp;January 2002. Since 2003, the Mint of Greece have been minting both normal issues of [[Greek euro coins]], which are intended for circulation, and commemorative euro coins in gold and silver.

These special coins have a [[legal tender]] only in Greece, unlike the normal issues of the Greek euro coins, which have a legal tender in every country of the Eurozone. This means that the commemorative coins made of gold and silver cannot be used as money in other countries. Furthermore, as their [[Precious metal#Bullion|bullion value]]&lt;ref&gt;Precious metals in bulk form are known as ''bullion'', and are traded on [[commodity market]]s. Bullion metals may be cast into [[ingot]]s, or minted into [[coin]]s. The defining attribute of bullion is that it is valued by its mass and purity rather than by a [[face value]] as money.&lt;/ref&gt; generally vastly exceeds their face value, these coins are not intended to be used as means of payment at allâalthough it remains possible. For this reason, they are usually named '''Collectors' coins'''.

The coins usually [[Commemorative coin|commemorate]] the [[Anniversary|anniversaries]] of [[History|historical events]] or draw attention to [[current events]] of special importance. Greece mints four of these coins on average per year, mainly in silver, with a typical face value of â¬10. However, to celebrate the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece minted almost three times more than normal number of coins in 2003 and 2004, in both gold and silver.

== Summary ==

As of 27&amp;nbsp;October 2008, 36 variations of Greek commemorative coins have been minted: 15 in 2003, 12 in 2004, one in 2005, three in 2006, four in 2007 and one in 2008 so far. These special high-value commemorative coins are not to be confused with [[â¬2 commemorative coins]], which are coins designated for circulation and do have legal tender status in all countries of the Eurozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[European Commission]] | url=http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/the_euro/notes_coins8787_en.htm | title=Different types of euro coins | accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Minoan civilization]] (2600-1100 BC) developed on the island of [[Crete]]. The Palace of Minos at [[Knossos]], was the economic and administrative center; it also had a sacred character. The palace, which is the subject of the first gold coin of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], is noteworthy for its many well preserved interior wall paintings depicting social life in the Minoan period including the famous wall painting &quot;Taurokatharpsia&quot; (bull vaulting), an ancient form of [[bullfighting]].

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left |[[Discus throw]]ing has remained virtually unchanged in the 28 centuries of its history. It is considered one of the most &quot;noble&quot; sporting events, since it did not have any direct connection with military exercises or farm work. In antiquity it formed part of the [[pentathlon]]. On the obverse of the coin a modern athlete is seen in the foreground in a half-turned position, while in the background an ancient discus thrower has been captured in a lively bending motion, with the discus high above his head, creating a vivid representation of the sport.

It was the only athletic event during the first 13 Olympiads until 728 BC.  In the obverse of the coin, a modern athlete figure appears in the foreground, shown in the starting position, while in the background two ancient runners are carved in a manner that gives the appearance of a coin that is &quot;worn&quot; by time.

The first games in Olympia are believed to have been held in 776 BC, a date that thereafter constituted the basis for the calculation of time in antiquity. The [[Olympiad]] was a period of four years, counting the interval between two Olympic Games. Initially local games, they soon became [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesian]] and then [[Names_of_the_Greeks#Hellenes_.28.CE.88.CE.BB.CE.BB.CE.B7.CE.BD.CE.B5.CF.82.29|pan-Hellenic]]. They acquired an official status, since, whenever in progress, a [[Olympic_truce#Olympic_truce|military truce]] was declared and any hostilities between rival Greek [[city-state]]s ceased. One of the most important monuments of Olympia is the Crypt, which has been selected as main motif on this coin on the obverse, a long and narrow vaulted passage through which the athletes and judges entered the Stadium, signifying the opening of the games.&lt;ref name=A2004-SS&gt;{{cite web | title=Athens 2004 - Olympic games coins - Second series | url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/currency/olympiceuros3.asp | publisher=Fleur de Coin | accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left |The [[Javelin#Ancient_Greece|javelin]] was  one of the pentathlon sports of the ancient Olympic Games and took on two forms (throwing the javelin for distance and throwing the javelin at a target). The difference between the ancient and the modern javelin is the use (in antiquity) of a thong, or strap to propel the javelin. The event of the [[javelin throw]] was re-introduced at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London for men only.  It was later extended in the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles, California]] for both, men and women. 

In the obverse of the coin, as a main motif, a modern athlete figure appears in the foreground, running towards the starting point of the throw. In the background, an ancient athlete is shown in preparation for the throw.&lt;ref name=A2004-SS/&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | [[Long jump]] is also one of the classical track events, drawing its roots from ancient times. In antiquity only the long jump without momentum existed, where the athlete had to hold [[Halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] ([[dumbbell]]s) in each hand, which he swung vigorously to help him achieve momentum, and then dropped behind him before landing. The men's long jump was for the first time on the programme of the [[1896 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], while the women's on the programme of the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London. In its modern version it assumes 4 forms: [[Long jump|simple jump]], [[triple jump]], [[high jump]] and [[pole vault]]. 

The obverse of the coin portrays a modern athlete at the moment he is touching the ground, while the ancient athlete in the background is shown while starting off his jump, as he is seen on a black-figure vase of the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name=A2004-SS/&gt;

The [[Panathenaic Games]] were held in this stadium, believed to have been built around 330 BC. In 1896, when the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first Olympic Games of the modern era]] were to be held, the Greek public benefactor [[George Averoff]] undertook the enormous expenses for the restoration of the stadium. Architect [[Anastasios Metaxas]] was in charge of the reconstruction. The inauguration of the stadium was celebrated on 25 March 1896 (Greece [[Independence Day]]), together with the opening of the first Olympic Games of modern times.

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | [[Equestrianism]] (horse riding) is a noble sport of great tradition, based on the relationship between humans and [[horse]]s. Two Equestrian events, [[chariot racing]] and [[horse racing]], were first included in the 25th ancient Olympic Games competition schedule, in 680 BC. Equestrian events developed primary from training [[horses in warfare]]. Many reports point to the fact that ancient Greeks used exercises similar to the modern [[Eventing#Dressage|Dressage events]], in order to train their horses to move accurately and precisely in the battlefields and in competition. Many Olympic coins were struck in antiquity on the occasion of victories in equestrian events. On the composition of the obverse of this coin, the modern horseman is pictured as he jumps over an obstacle, while in the background the ancient horseman is inspired by a representation on a black-figure vase of the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name=A2004-TS/&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | [[Relay race]]s can be traced to the ancient custom of sending messages via a series of couriers (skytalodromoi or &quot;runners with a message stick&quot;). Each courier handed the stick to the next courier until its destination was safely reached. In the Olympic relay race each country has four runners. Each runner covers a quarter of the distance, called a leg, then passes a rigid hollow tube called a baton to a succeeding team member. Changeovers must be accomplished within a zone extending 18 m (20 yd) from the beginning of each baton exchange area. In the obverse of the coin three modern athletes run, holding their batons while in the background three ancient athletes are shown running a race known as the [[Dolichos (running race)|dolichos]] (a semi-endurance race of approximately 3,800 meters distance).&lt;ref name=A2004-TS/&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | The [[Zappeion]], which is the subject of the fourth gold coin of the series, is related to the first Modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. At that time the lack of infrastructure and facilities for the participants required the use of the mansion as an &quot;[[Olympic Village]]&quot;.  The Zappeion was an Athenian mansion built at the expense of the Greek public benefactor [[Evangelos Zappas]] (1800â1865) to serve as the venue for Greek artistic, agricultural and industrial fairs. In order to create a garden around the building, [[Charilaos Trikoupis]] decided to relocate the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[cemetery]] that was situated there. The Zappeion, designed by the architect [[Baron Theophil von Hansen]], was built between 1874 and 1888. It was originally given the name 'Olympia' and acquired its present name after the death of the two brothers Evangelos and Konstantinos Zappas, whose busts â created by the well-known Greek sculptors I. Kossos and G. Vroutos respectively â stand at the entrance of the building.&lt;ref name=A2004-FOS&gt;{{cite web | title=Athens 2004 - Olympic games coins - Four series | url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/currency/olympiceuros5.asp | publisher=Fleur de Coin | accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | [[Rhythmic gymnastics]] is one of the oldest sports in the world. In ancient Greece, three distinct programmes of gymnastic exercise were developed: one for the maintenance of good physical condition, another for military training, and a third as part of the conditioning regimen for athletes. Modern rhythmic gymnastics were developed in the late 1950s. In this &quot;for females only&quot; sport, disciplines are characterized by the use of accessories such as a ball, clubs, hoop and rope, and ribbons, to the accompaniment of music. The obverse of the coin represents a young woman holding a ribbon, executing a graceful movement, while in the background, two female athletes from antiquity execute a series of acrobatic interactions. The scene was taken from a [[terra cotta]] in [[Southern Italy]].&lt;ref name=A2004-FOS/&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | The [[Acropolis of Athens]] was selected as the main motif of the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] of this coin. It encompasses a collection of ancient Greek monuments, including the [[Parthenon]], the [[Erechtheum]], the [[Propylaea]], the [[Temple of Athena Nike]], ... among others. The Acropolis represents all the periods of the city that lies at its feet, since all the historical events of Athens unfolded and centered around this low rock. It was constructed between 447 BC and 432 BC and was originally painted in vivid reds and blues, but the marble pillars gradually lost their color and faded to white. It is also directly relevant to athletic events since during the [[Panathenaic Festival]] a torch race took place at night, starting from the altar of [[Prometheus]] in the Academy and ending before the altar of [[Athena]] on the top of the rock.

The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]], similarly to the set of coins of 2003, features two concentric rings. The outer ring portrays 12 stars, a design motif characteristic of [[euro coins]]. The inner ring portrays the face value of â¬100, an olive branch around the Athens 2004 logo, the [[Olympic symbols|five Olympic circles]], and the [[Palmette|Anthemion Flower]] - the symbol of the Greek Mint.&lt;ref name=A2004OS5&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/currency/olympiceuros6.asp | title=Athens 2004 - Olympic games coins - Fifth Series | publisher=Fleur de Coin | accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | The modern [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] is the foremost intellectual institution of modern Greece with the promotion of the Arts and Sciences as its most basic mission. The first discussions regarding its establishment took place during meetings of the [[Greek National Assembly]] at [[Epidaurus]] in 1826. The building, designed by the Danish architect [[Baron Theophil von Hansen]], began construction in 1859 on a site ceded by the [[Petraki Monastery]] and the [[Athens#Athens_Municipality|Athens municipality]], with funds offered for the purpose by the Greek public benefactor, [[Baron Simon Sinas|Simon Sinas]]. Hence, it is also known as the ''Sinaea Academia''. The Academy began to operate in 1926, and is constituted by three departments, Exact Sciences, Fine Arts Letters and the Moral and Political Sciences.

The Academy is the motif of the sixth gold Olympic coin of the series. The intention was to highlight the premise that in the city of Athena, the Olympic Games should not only be the most important athletic event, but also reflect equal importance toward intellectual and cultural activities.  All three should be equivalent to the style and character of the city that was the birthplace and the matrix for the revival of the modern Olympic Games of 1896.&lt;ref name=A2004OS6&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/currency/olympiceuros7.asp | title=Athens 2004 - Olympic games coins - Sixth Series | publisher=Fleur de Coin | accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the ball was a symbol for the [[Sun]] and &quot;conquering&quot; it would ensure fertility and a good crop. 

The design of this coin represents a modern football player ready to hit the ball, his ancient counterpart demonstrates his technique by bouncing a ball on his thigh, his hands tied behind his back. The representation was taken from a 4th century BC. marble relief.&lt;ref name=A2004OS6/&gt;

To symbolize the link between the ancient and modern Olympic Games the flame is lit in a ceremony at Olympia, Greece, and then carried, by runners, to the Olympic site for that year. The lighting of the Olympic cauldron has become the most hallowed moment of each Olympic Games and is depicted on the first gold coin of the Torch Relay series.&lt;ref name=TOURCHCOINS/&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | The [[2004 Summer Olympics torch relay]] was the first truly universal relay ever. The Olympic Flame started its journey at Ancient Olympia and was carried by 3600 torch bearers across 34 cities throughout the world. On 3 June 2004, the flame was carried to Australia, from there it travelled to Asia, to Africa and to the [[Americas]]. It was the first time the Olympic Flame was transported to Africa and South America. The Flame then returned to Europe and reached its destination, Greece, on 9 July 2004. The four silver coins depict the Olympic Torch Relay from Europe to the other four continents.&lt;ref name=TOURCHCOINS/&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | Valia Kalda means warm valley. Spreading over {{convert|6.8|acre|m2}}, it is the largest and most important [[National parks of Greece|national park of Greece]]. Its official name is the National Park of Northern [[Pindus|Pindos]] and is situated at the mountain range of Pindos, around 25&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Metsovo]], at the borders of the cities [[Ioannina]] and [[Grevena]]. The tour of the valley, which was named &quot;warm&quot;, as its temperature is 10-15 degrees higher than the mountains around it, is a unique experience. This park has been selected as the motif of this coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fleur-de-coin.com/shop/showcart.asp?id=drs151 | title=Pine Trees Commemorative Coin | publisher=Fleur de Coin | accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| colspan=&quot;5&quot; align=left | The [[Acropolis Museum]] is an archaeological museum located in [[Athens]], Greece, on the archeological site of [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]]. It is considered one of the major archaeological museums in Athens and ranks among the most important museums of the world. Due to its limited size, the [[Greek Government]] decided in the late 1980s to build a new museum. The [[New Acropolis Museum]] is now being built at the base of the Acropolis. In June 2007 the old museum closed its doors so that its antiquities could be moved to their new home. The new museum opened in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newacropolismuseum.gr/eng/ New Acropolis Museum | title=The New Acropolis Museum | publisher=The New Acropolis Museum | accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coin was issued to commemorate the re-opening of the museum. On the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] a panoramic view of the Acropolis can be seen; the museum resides in the base of it. On the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]], one of the pedimental sculptures from the [[Parthenon]] can be observed together with the [[National emblem of Greece]] and the face value of â¬10.
