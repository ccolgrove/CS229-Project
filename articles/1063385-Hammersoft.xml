Certain phrases from it are widely recognised and often used in reference to, but outside the context of, the source material. Many writers on [[popular science]], such as [[Fred Alan Wolf]], [[Paul Davies]], [[Max Miller]] and [[Michio Kaku]], have used quotations from Adams' work in their books to illustrate facts about cosmology or philosophy.

== Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything (42) ==
{{split section|42 (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Talk:Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Split 42|date=November 2011}}
[[File:Answer to Life.png|thumb|The Ultimate Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything.]]
In the first novel and radio series, a group of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings demand to learn the '''Ultimate Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything''' from the supercomputer, [[Deep Thought (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Deep Thought]], specially built for this purpose. It takes Deep Thought 7Â½ million years to compute and check the answer, which turns out to be '''[[42 (number)|42]].''' The Ultimate Question itself is unknown.

When asked to produce The Ultimate Question, the computer says that it cannot; however, it can help to design an even more powerful computer, the [[Earth]], that can. The programmers then embark on a further ten-million-year program to discover The Ultimate Question. This new computer will incorporate living beings in the &quot;[[Numerical analysis#Direct and iterative methods|computational matrix]]&quot;, with the pan-dimensional creators assuming the form of [[mice]]. The process is hindered after eight million years by the unexpected arrival on Earth of the [[Golgafrinchans]] and then is ruined completely, five minutes before completion, when the Earth is destroyed by the [[Vogon]]s to make way for a new Hyperspace Bypass. This is later revealed to have been a ruse: the Vogons had been hired to destroy the Earth by a consortium of psychiatrists, led by [[Gag Halfrunt]], who feared for the loss of their careers when the [[meaning of life]] became known.&lt;ref name=&quot;book2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Restaurant at the End of the Universe|author=Douglas Adams|date=1 January 1980|isbn=0-345-39181-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacking a real question, the mice decide not to go through the whole thing again and settle for the out-of-thin-air suggestion &quot;How many roads must a man walk down?&quot; from [[Bob Dylan]]'s protest song &quot;[[Blowin' in the Wind]]&quot;.

At the end of the radio series (and television series, as well as {{H2G2|book|2|link=yes}}) [[Arthur Dent]], having escaped the Earth's destruction, potentially has some of the [[Numerical analysis#Direct and iterative methods|computational matrix]] in his brain. He attempts to discover The Ultimate Question by extracting it from his [[brainwave]] patterns, as abusively&lt;ref name=&quot;tv6&quot;&gt;{{H2G2|tv|6|link=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested by [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]], when a [[Scrabble]]-playing caveman spells out '''forty two'''.
Arthur pulls random letters from a bag, but only gets the sentence '''&quot;What do you get if you multiply six by nine?&quot;'''&lt;!-- Please STOP changing this to &quot;six by seven&quot;. The calculation is SUPPOSED to be wrong. --&gt;
{{cquote2|&quot;Six by nine. Forty two.&quot;

&quot;That's it. That's all there is.&quot;

&quot;I always thought something was fundamentally wrong with the universe&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;book2&quot; /&gt;}}

Six times nine is, of course, fifty-four. The program on the &quot;Earth computer&quot; should have run correctly, but the unexpected arrival of the [[Golgafrinchans]] on prehistoric Earth caused input errors into the system&amp;mdash;computing (because of the [[garbage in, garbage out]] rule) the wrong question&amp;mdash;the question in Arthur's subconscious being invalid all along.&lt;ref name=&quot;book2&quot; /&gt;

Quoting [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Seventh|Fit the Seventh]] of the radio series, on Christmas Eve, 1978:

{{cquote2|Narrator: There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.

There is another theory which states that this has already happened.&lt;ref name=&quot;scripts&quot;&gt;''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts|The Original Hitchhiker Radio Scripts]]''. [[Douglas Adams]], edited by [[Geoffrey Perkins]]. Pan Books, London. 1985. ISBN 0-330-29288-9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some readers subsequently noticed that 6&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; Ã 9&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; = 42&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; (using [[base 13]]). [[Douglas Adams]] later joked about this observation, saying, &quot;I may be a sorry case, but I don't write jokes in base 13.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/F6444021?thread=4178545 |title=BBC - h2g2 - A Conversation Forum |accessdate=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', [[Prak]], a man who knows all that is true, confirms that 42 is indeed The Ultimate Answer, and confirms that it is impossible for both The Ultimate Answer and The Ultimate Question to be known about in the same universe (compare the [[uncertainty principle]]) as they will cancel each other out and take the Universe with them to be replaced by something even more bizarre (as described in the first theory) and that it may have already happened (as described in the second).&lt;ref name=&quot;book3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-330-26738-8 |title=Life, the Universe and Everything |author=Douglas Adams |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the question is never found, 42 is shown as the table number at which Arthur and his friends sit when they arrive at [[Milliways]] at the end of the radio series. Likewise, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'' ends when Arthur stops at a street address identified by his cry of, &quot;There, number 42!&quot; and enters the club Beta, owned by Stavro Mueller, who is apparently the incarnation of [[Agrajag]] located at [[Stavromula Beta]]. Shortly after, the earth is destroyed in all existing incarnations.

=== The number 42 ===

Please do not add your own speculations about the significance of the number 42. Sourced examples only. Thank you. 

--&gt;
Douglas Adams was asked many times why he chose the number 42. Many theories were proposed,&lt;ref name='CIO; Definition of &quot;42&quot;'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchcio-midmarket.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid183_gci211501,00.html |title=In ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', 42 is the number from which all meaning could be derived. |accessdate=2008-03-03 |coauthors=Peter Minearo, Mike Smith |date=2007-04-03 |work=CIO (Chief Information Officer) Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he rejected them all. On November 3, 1993, he gave an answer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/msg/d1064f7b27808692?dmode=source|title= Why 42 ? - alt.fan.douglas-adams - Google Groups |accessdate=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Usenet newsgroup|alt.fan.douglas-adams]]:

{{cquote2|The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. [[Binary numeral system|Binary]] representations, [[base 13|base thirteen]], [[Tibetan people#Religion|Tibetan monks]] are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought '42 will do' I typed it out. End of story.}}
&lt;!-- note that no period appears on the original post after '42 will do' although one should have - do not correct.--&gt;

Adams described his choice as 'a completely ordinary number, a number not just divisible by two but also six and seven. In fact it's the sort of number that you could without any fear introduce to your parents'.&lt;ref name=&quot;scripts&quot;/&gt;

While 42 was a number with no hidden meaning, Adams explained in more detail in an interview with [[Iain Johnstone]] of [[BBC Radio 4]] (recorded in [[1998]] though never broadcast)&lt;ref&gt;This interview is contained on ''[[Douglas Adams's Guide to The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (BBC Cassette ISBN 0-563-55236-0) and ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - The Collectors Edition'' (BBC CD ISBN 0-563-47702-4)&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the first radio broadcast's 20th anniversary. Having decided it should be a number, he tried to think what an &quot;ordinary number&quot; should be. He ruled out non-integers, then he remembered having worked as a &quot;prop-borrower&quot; for [[John Cleese]] on his [[Video Arts]] training videos. Cleese needed a ''funny number'' for the punchline to a sketch involving a bank teller (himself) and a customer ([[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]). Adams believed that the number that Cleese came up with was 42 and he decided to use it.&lt;ref&gt;Several attempts by fans to find this particular video have been unsuccessful and it is possible it may never have been published or has since been deleted from use.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams also had written a sketch for [[The Burkiss Way]] called &quot;42 [[Logical positivism|Logical Positivism]] Avenue&quot;, broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 12 January 1977&lt;ref&gt;This is found on the [[Douglas Adams at the BBC]] CD set (ISBN 0-563-49404-2)&lt;/ref&gt; â 14 months before the Hitchhiker's Guide first broadcast &quot;42&quot; in fit the fourth, 29 March 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;scripts&quot; /&gt;

{{Listen|filename=42 Logical Positivism Avenue.ogg
|title=Burkiss Way, &quot;Logical Positivism&quot; sketch excerpt |description=An excerpt from Douglas Adam's [[The Burkiss Way]] sketch, &quot;Logical Positivism&quot; excerpt}}

In January 2000, in response to a panelist's &quot;Where does the number 42 come from?&quot; on the radio show &quot;Book Club&quot; Adams explained that he was &quot;on his way to work one morning, whilst still writing the scene, and was thinking about what the actual answer should be. He eventually decided that it should be something that made no sense whatsoever- a number, and a mundane one at that. And that is how he arrived at the number 42, completely at random.&quot;

[[Stephen Fry]], a friend of Adams, claims that Adams told him &quot;exactly why 42&quot;, and that the reason is &quot;fascinating, extraordinary and, when you think hard about it, completely obvious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7283155.stm |title=BBC News - Magazine - What on earth is 42? |accessdate=2008-03-22 |date=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fry says that he has vowed not to tell anyone the secret, and that it must go with him to the grave. [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]], Adams' collaborator on ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' and two ''Hitchhiker's'' fits, said that Douglas has called 42 &quot;the funniest of the two-digit numbers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Lloyd speaking at the 30th Anniversary Hitchhiker's recording at Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture on Wednesday 12th March 2008 at The Royal Geographical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[42 (number)|number 42]] also [[42 (number)#In the works of Lewis Carroll|appears frequently]] in the work of [[Lewis Carroll]], and some critics have suggested that this was an influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb346/is_1_38/ai_n29162565/ Lewis Carroll and Douglas Adams].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Mystery of Lewis Carroll,'' Jenny Woolf.&lt;/ref&gt; Other purported Carroll influences include that Adams named the episodes of the original radio series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' &quot;fits&quot;, the word Carroll used to name the chapters of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]''.  Any influence may have been unconscious, see [[cryptomnesia]].

There is the persistent tale that forty-two is actually Adams' tribute to the indefatigable paperback book, and is really the average number of lines on an average page of an average paperback book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7283155.stm |title=What on earth is 42? |accessdate=June 9, 2008 |last=Vernon |first=Mark |date=7 March 2008 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Songwriter [[John Galla]] proposes on his debut album, &quot;Sketch,&quot; that &quot;42&quot; is a play on the words: &quot;For tea...two&quot;. The significance of the number represents &quot;true connection with another living being...however fleeting.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;Galla, J. - &lt;u&gt;&quot;42.For Tea...Two&quot;&lt;/u&gt;; &quot;Sketch&quot; (UPC 884501485371), Â©[[Aural Mosaic Records]];2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reverbnation.com/page_object/page_object_photos/artist_1111158?sel_photo_id=4826093 |title=John Galla :: Photos |publisher=ReverbNation |date= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 42 Puzzle ===
[[File:Hitchhiker's Guide (book cover).jpg|thumb|The 42 puzzle. Note that the land in the background spells out 42, and that there are 42 colored balls]]
The '''42 Puzzle''' is a game devised by [[Douglas Adams]] in 1994 for the [[United States]] series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' books. The puzzle is an illustration consisting of 42 multi-coloured balls, in 7 columns and 6 rows. Douglas Adams has said,

{{cquote2|Everybody was looking for hidden meanings and puzzles and significances in what I had written (like 'is it significant that {{nowrap|1=6Ã9 = 42}} in base 13?'. As if.) So I thought that just for a change I would actually construct a puzzle and see how many people solved it. Of course, nobody paid it any attention. I think that's terribly significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douglasadams.se/stuff/qanda.html |title=Cool questions and answers with Douglas Adams |accessdate=2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the puzzle the question is unknown, but the answer is already known to be 42.

The puzzle first appeared in ''The Illustrated [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. It was later incorporated into the covers of all five reprinted &quot;Hitchhiker's&quot; novels in the United States.

Six of the solutions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/education-books/douglas-adams/4-8-Probable-Solution-to-the-Ill-Guide-Puzzle-Douglas-Adams.html|title=4.8 Probable Solution to the Ill Guide Puzzle (Douglas Adams)|accessdate=2007-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On the Internet ===
The number 42 and the phrase, &quot;Life, the universe, and everything&quot; have attained cult status on the [[Internet]]. &quot;Life, the Universe, and Everything&quot; is a common name for the off-topic section of an [[Internet forum]] and the phrase is invoked in similar ways to mean &quot;anything at all&quot;. Many [[chatbots]], when asked about the meaning of life, will answer &quot;42&quot;. Several online calculators are also programmed with the Question. If you type ''the answer to life the universe and everything'' into [[Google]] (without quotes or capitalising the small words), the Google Calculator will give you 42, as will [[Wolfram Alpha|Wolfram's Computational Knowledge Engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=answer+to+life%2C+the+universe%2C+and+everything |title=answer to life, the universe, and everything - Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha |publisher=Wolframalpha.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if you type ''the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything'' into [[DuckDuckGo]], the 0-click box will read &quot;42&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duckduckgo.com/?q=the+answer+to+the+ultimate+question+of+life%2C+the+universe+and+everything |title=the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything at Duck Duck Go |publisher=Duckduckgo.com |date=2010-10-10 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the online community [[Second Life]], there is a section on a sim called &quot;42nd Life.&quot; It is devoted to this concept in the book series, and several attempts at recreating Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, were made. In Facebook Chat there is an emoticon for 42 created by typing :42: .

Shortly after Adams died in 2001, the [[Darwin Awards]] Forums announced that, in his honour, the number of posts required for a member to get out of &quot;newbie&quot; status would henceforth be decreased from 50 to 42.

In the [[OpenOffice.org]] software, if you type into any cell of a [[spreadsheet]] ''=ANTWORT(&quot;Das Leben, das Universum und der ganze Rest&quot;)'', which means ''the answer to life, the universe and everything'', the result is 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Easter_Eggs |title=Easter Eggs - OpenOffice.org Wiki |publisher=Wiki.services.openoffice.org |date=2010-04-21 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''ISO/IEC 14519-2001/ IEEE Std 1003.5-1999, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - [[POSIX]](R) Ada Language Interfaces - Part 1: Binding for System Application Program Interface (API) '', uses the number '42' as the required return value from a process that terminates due to an unhandled exception.  The Rationale says &quot;the choice of the value 42 is arbitrary&quot; and cites the Adams book as the source of the value.

== Knowing where one's towel is ==
Somebody who can stay in control of virtually any situation is somebody who is said to know where his or her towel is. The logic behind this statement is presented in chapter 3 of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' thus:

{{cquote2|
... a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might accidentally have &quot;lost&quot;. What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
}}

[[Douglas Adams]] got the idea for this phrase when he went on holiday and found that his beach towel kept disappearing. On [[Towel Day]], fans commemorate Douglas Adams by carrying towels with them.

In 2001, after Adams' death, a towel was introduced, in memory of Douglas Adams, into the [[MMORPG]] [[Asheron's Call]] as a unique item players could obtain.

== Mostly Harmless ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Perfect Dark]] --&gt;
The only entry about Earth in the ''Guide'' used to be &quot;Harmless&quot;, but Ford Prefect managed to change it a little before getting stuck on Earth. &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; provoked a very upset reaction from Arthur when heard. (Those two words are not what Ford submitted as a result of his research&amp;nbsp;â merely all that was left after his editors were done with it.) It is the title of the [[Mostly Harmless|fifth book]] in the ''Hitchhiker'' series. Its popularity is such that it has become the definition of Earth in many standard works of sci-fi reference, like ''[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]''. Additionally, &quot;Harmless&quot; and &quot;Mostly Harmless&quot; both feature as ranks in the computer game ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]''. Also, in ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', there is a rifle that fires (mostly) harmless pellets. In the [[MMORPG]] ''[[RuneScape]]'', there is an island called Mos Le Harmless (Mostly Harmless). Low-scoring players in the multiplayer version of the game ''[[Perfect Dark]]'' and ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' are awarded with the designation &quot;mostly harmless&quot;. In the 2008 edition of the board game Cosmic Encounter, the Human race is given the attribute &quot;Mostly Harmless.&quot;

== Not entirely unlike ==
In {{H2G2|book|2|link=yes}}, [[Arthur Dent]] tries to get a [[Nutrimatic drinks dispenser]] to produce a cup of [[tea]]. Instead, it invariably produces a concoction (which most people found unpleasant) that is &quot;almost, but not quite, entirely ''unlike'' tea&quot;. One of the primary goals of the player, as Arthur Dent, in {{H2G2|game|1|link=yes}}, is to thwart the machine and find some decent tea, a mission that the player is constantly reminded of by the inventory item &quot;no tea&quot;. According to the [[Jargon File]], the briefer &quot;not entirely unlike&quot; has entered hacker jargon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/N/not-entirely-unlike-X.html &quot;not entirely unlike X&quot;] - The Jargon File (version 4.4.7)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Share and Enjoy ==
&quot;'''Share and Enjoy'''&quot; is the slogan of the complaints division of the [[Sirius Cybernetics Corporation]]. In the radio version, this phrase had its own song (sung in {{H2G2|radio|9|link=yes}}), which was sung by a choir of robots during &quot;special occasions&quot;. However, the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation tends to produce inherently faulty goods, which makes the slogan ironic since few people would &quot;Share and Enjoy&quot; a product that does not function properly. Among the design flaws is the choir of robots that sings the song: they sing a [[tritone]] out of tune with the accompaniment. The Guide relates that the words &quot;''Share and Enjoy''&quot; were displayed in illuminated letters three miles high near the Sirius Cybernetics Complaints Department, until their weight caused them to collapse through the underground offices of many young executives. The upper half of the sign that now protrudes translates in the local tongue as &quot;''Go stick your head in a pig''&quot;, and is lit up only for special celebrations.

The {{H2G2|radio|20|link=yes}} features a [[personal computer]] OS booting sound (Ã  la [[The Microsoft Sound]]) set to the tune of &quot;Share and Enjoy&quot;. Furthermore, {{H2G2|radio|21|link=yes}}, the last episode in the adaption of {{H2G2|book|4|link=yes}}, features a [[polyphonic ringtone]] version of the tune. The &quot;Share and Enjoy&quot; tune also is used in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|TV series]] as the backing for a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robot commercial ([[slogan]]: &quot;Your plastic pal who's fun to be with!&quot;).

This phrase is often invoked in releasing [[freeware]], [[shareware]], or [[open source]] software, though without its ironic connotations.

== So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish ==
After mice, the second most intelligent species on Earth were the [[dolphin]]s. {{quote|Although they had long known that Earth was about to be destroyed, their attempts to communicate this knowledge to humanity were misinterpreted as attempts to jump through hoops for bits of fish. They left the Earth just prior to its destruction, but left humanity one last message, a triple backwards somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the ''[[Star Spangled Banner]]'', when, in fact, the message was this: &quot;'''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish'''.&quot;|Douglas Adams|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}} The line was also the title of the [[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish|fourth book in the series]], and appears in that book as a message inscribed on crystal bowls left as parting gifts from the dolphins to the human race. Its popularity was such that it was the title of the opening song for {{H2G2|movie|1|link=yes}}.

Also the phrase was spoofed for the [[NOFX]] album ''[[So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes]]''.

When [[MyRealBox]] shut down on 2011-06-01, the final phrase of their [http://www.emaildiscussions.com/showpost.php?p=523289&amp;postcount=26 announcement] was &quot;So long, and thanks for all the fish&quot;.
