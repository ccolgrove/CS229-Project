==Athletics==
{{Main|Coastal Carolina Chanticleers}}

Coastal Carolina's athletic programs compete in [[NCAA Division I]] as a member of the [[Big South Conference]] (the [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers football|football]] team competes in the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision]]). The primary colors of the university's athletic programs are teal, black and bronze.

Until the mid-1960s Coastal's teams were known as the Trojans. Upon its affiliation with the University of South Carolina, the push was made for a mascot more in line with the parent's mascot (the Gamecock); the ultimate choice was the [[Chanticleer_and_the_Fox|Chanticleer]] (pronounced SHON-ti-clear), the proud, witty rooster made famous in &quot;[[The Nun's Priest's Tale]]&quot; of [[Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (the mascot itself would be named Chauncey). When Coastal became an independent university in 1993, despite some calls for &quot;a complete split from USC&quot; (i.e., change the mascot), the Chanticleer remained the school's mascot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coastal.edu/about/chanticleer.html&lt;/ref&gt;
