<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="7050493" ns="0" title="List of Dune terminology"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">This is a list of terminology used in the fictional [[Dune universe|''Dune'' universe]] created by [[Frank Herbert]], the primary source being &quot;Terminology of the Imperium,&quot; the glossary contained in the novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' (1965). 

''Dune'' word construction could be classified into three domains of vocabulary, each marked with its own [[neology]]: the names and terms related to the politics and culture of the Galactic Empire, the names and terms characteristic of the mystic [[sodality]] of the [[Bene Gesserit]], and the barely displaced Arabic of the [[Fremen]] language.
Fremen share vocabulary for [[Arrakis|Arrakeen]] phenomena with the Empire, but use completely different vocabulary for Bene Gesserit-implanted [[Messianism|messianic religion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;7 Beauties&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Seven Beauties of Science Fiction |first=Istvan |last=Csicsery-Ronay, Jr. |publisher=Wesleyan |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ZVYxl5ued-oC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=SXCbLw__1D&amp;dq=The%20seven%20beauties%20of%20science%20fiction%20by%20Istvan%20Csicsery-Ronay%2C%20Jr.%2C%20Istvan%20Csicsery-Ronay%20%28Jr.%29&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |date=November 28, 2008 |isbn=0819568899}}&lt;/ref&gt;
