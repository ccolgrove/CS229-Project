'''Quinnipiac University''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|k|w|Éª|n|É¨|p|i:|Ã¦|k}}) is a [[private university|private]], [[nonsectarian]], [[coeducation]]al [[university]] located in [[Hamden, Connecticut|Hamden]], [[Connecticut]], [[United States]] at the foot of [[Sleeping Giant (Connecticut)|Sleeping Giant State Park]]. The university grants undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees through its College of Arts and Sciences; School of Business; School of Communications; School of Health Sciences; [[Quinnipiac University School of Law|School of Law]]; School of Nursing and School of Education. [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'s 2009 ''America's Best Colleges'' issue has ranked Quinnipiac University first among northern universities with master's degree programs as having made the most promising and innovative changes in academics, faculty, campus or facilities. Quinnipiac is home to a well-known [[Quinnipiac University Poll|Polling Institute]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
[[File:Quinnipiac University from atop Sleeping Giant.jpg|thumb|right|272px|The Mount Carmel campus, from atop [[Sleeping Giant (Connecticut)|Sleeping Giant]], April 2009.]]
Quinnipiac University was founded in 1929 by Samuel W. Tator, a business professor and politician. Judge Phillip Troup, a [[Yale College]] graduate, and Tator's wife, Irmagarde Tator, a [[Mount Holyoke College]] graduate, also played major roles in the fledgling institution's founding and nurturing;the former became its first president until his death in 1939; the latter, its first bursar. 

Quinnipiac was conceived in reaction to [[Northeastern University]]'s abandonment of its [[New Haven, Connecticut]] program at the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. Originally, Quinnipiac was located in New Haven and called Connecticut College of Commerce. On opening its doors in 1929, it enrolled under 200, and its first graduating class featured only eight students. At the time, it awarded only [[associate's degrees]]. In 1935, the college changed its name to Junior College of Commerce.

From 1943-1945, the college closed; nearly its entire student body was drafted into [[World War II]]. Upon re-opening, the college's enrollment nearly quadrupled to approximately 800 students.

In 1951, the institution was renamed Quinnipiac College, in honor of the [[Quinnipiac]] Indian tribe that once inhabited [[Greater New Haven]]. That same year, Quinnipiac began to confer [[bachelor's degrees]]. In 1952, Quinnipiac expanded rapidly, both physically and in terms of curriculum, relocating to a larger campus in New Haven, and also assuming administrative control of Larson College, a private women's college.

In 1966, after having outgrown its campus in New Haven, Quinnipiac moved to its current campus in [[Hamden, Connecticut]]'s Mount Carmel section, at the foot of [[Sleeping Giant (Connecticut)|Sleeping Giant Park]]. Quinnipiac's relatively uniform red-brick architecture results from much of it being built at (or around) that time. During the 1970s, Quinnipiac began to offer [[master's degrees]] in a variety of disciplines. 

Until the 1990s, Quinnipiac remained primarily a commuter college with only a regional reputation; however, that changed during the next decade. In 1995, the [[University of Bridgeport]]'s law school migrated to Quinnipiac. That same year, the [[American Bar Association]] accredited Quinnipiac to award the [[Juris Doctor]] degree. The Quinnipiac School of Law Center was dedicated later that year as well. Also, during the mid-1990s, Quinnipiac's communication and business programs, respectively, built state-of-the-art facilities and attracted nationally-known professors. Quinnipiac's Polling Institute was noted for excellence by several prominent journalistic outlets, and often cited during the 1998 and 2000 election campaigns.

On July 1, 2000, the school officially changed its name to Quinnipiac University&amp;mdash;to reflect its relatively new breadth in academic offerings. That same year, Quinnipiac University received accreditation by [[AACSB]]. 

Currently, Quinnipiac offers 52 undergraduate majors, 20 graduate programs, and a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] program. Its new medical school plans to admit students starting in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Palmer, [http://www.conntact.com/education/10855-a-higher-ed-boon-in-bad-times.html A Higher-Ed Boon in Bad Times], Conntact.com, &lt;/ref&gt; Quinnipiac's Polling Institute often garners the university national media attention.

The university operates several media outlets, including a professionally-run, commercial radio station [[WQUN]], founded by journalist and Quinnipiac professor Lou Adler. The university also operates a student-run FM radio station [[WQAQ]], which concurrently streams on the Internet. A student-run television station, [[Q30]], can be viewed only on campus. Also, a student-produced newspaper, ''The Chronicle'', established in 1929, publishes 2,500 copies every Wednesday.

Quinnipiac is home to one of the world's largest collections of art commemorating the [[Great Irish Famine]]. The collection is contained in the Lender Family Special Collection room located in the Arnold Bernhard library.

==Campuses==

Quinnipiac University consists of three campuses, all within the [[Hamden,_Connecticut|Hamden]] and [[North_Haven,_Connecticut|North Haven]] areas, just north of [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

The oldest of these campuses is the Mount Carmel campus, at the foot of the [[Sleeping Giant]] State Park. The Arnold Bernhard Library, Carl Hansen Student Center, university administration, and many of the student residences may be found on this campus. 

York Hill, located on a hill about a half-mile from the Mount Carmel campus, began with the development of the [[TD Bank Sports Center]]. In 2010 this was joined by a new student center as well as expanded parking and residence facilities as part of a $300 million expansion of the {{convert|250|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyork.construction.com/features/archive/2009/06_C_York_Hill_Campus_Expansion.asp York Hill Campus Expansion], ''McGraw-Hill Construction'', June, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; York Hill is a &quot;green&quot; campus, making use of renewable energy and environmentally-friendly resources, including one of the first major wind farms integrated into a university campus.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Prevost, [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/08/realestate/08wczo.html School Colors: Green and Greener], ''New York Times'', November 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, Quinnipiac acquired a {{convert|100|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus in [[North Haven, Connecticut]] from [[Blue Cross Blue Shield|Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield]], and has been gradually converting it for use by graduate programs at the university.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x3363.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

The polling operation began informally in 1988 in conjunction with a marketing class.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate101608&quot;/&gt;  It became serious in 1994 when the university hired a [[CBS News]] analyst to assess the data being gained.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate101608&quot;/&gt;  It subsequently focused on the Northeastern states, gradually expanding during presidential elections to cover [[swing state]]s as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate101608&quot;/&gt;  The institute receives funding from the university,&lt;ref name=&quot;slate101608&quot;/&gt; with its phone callers generally being work study students or local residents.

There are seven men's varsity sports and 14 women's varsity sports.&lt;ref name=&quot;qbcmain&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quinnipiacbobcats.com/ | title=Quinnipiac University's Official Athletics Site | author=QuinnipiacBobcats.com | publisher=Quinnipiac University | accessdate=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no football team.&lt;ref name=&quot;qbcmain&quot;/&gt; The team with the largest following on campus and in the area is the men's ice hockey team under established coach Rand Pecknold,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt122607&quot;/&gt; which has been nationally ranked at times; during the 2009â2010 season they entered the top ten of the national polls for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.quinnipiacbobcats.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17500&amp;atclid=204839212&amp;CFID=43192268&amp;CFTOKEN=83754460&amp;jsessionid=503015367e6452111679 | title=Men's Ice Hockey Ranked In Top 10 Nationally For First Time In Program History | author=QuinnipiacBobcats.com | publisher=Quinnipiac University | date=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quinnipiac Bobcats women's ice hockey|Quinnipiac women's ice hockey]] program had their most successful season in the [[2009â10 NCAA Division I women's ice hockey season]]. Quinnipiac University added a women's golf and women's rugby team in the 2010-11 academic year.&lt;ref name=&quot;qbcmain&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quinnipiacbobcats.com/ | title=Quinnipiac University's Official Athletics Site | author=QuinnipiacBobcats.com | publisher=Quinnipiac University | accessdate=February 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s the men's basketball team gained a greater following than before under new head coach [[Tom Moore (basketball coach)|Tom Moore]], a disciple of [[UConn Huskies]] men's basketball coach [[Jim Calhoun]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt122607&quot;/&gt;  Both men's and women's ice hockey and basketball teams play at the $52 million, 2007-opened [[TD Bank Sports Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt122607&quot;/&gt;  The women's lacrosse team has also been quite strong.  The athletics program has been under pressures common to other universities, and at the close of the 2008â2009 academic year, men's golf, men's outdoor track and women's volleyball were dropped as a cost-cutting measure, although the last of these was restored (as a result of a Title IX suit&lt;ref&gt;ACLU, [http://www.acluct.org/aboutus/pressroom/eliminationofwomensvolleyb.htm Elimination of women's volleyball team intensifies title IX failures]&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Title IX discrimination case===
On July 21, 2010, a federal judge ruled that Quinnipiac violated [[Title IX]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] by failing to provide equal treatment to women's athletic teams.   The judge determined that Quinnipiac's decision to eliminate the women's volleyball team, its attempt to treat cheerleading as a competitive sport, and its manipulation of its reporting with regard to the numbers of male and female athletes amounted to unlawful discrimination against female students.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100721/ap_on_sp_ot/vol_title_ix_cheerleading&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student journalism controversy==
Quinnipiac has been at the center of controversy over the university's control over [[student newspaper|student publications]] and students' [[freedom of speech|speech]]. The conflict has drawn national attention.

The problems began in the Fall 2007 semester, when junior Jason Braff, then editor of the ''Quinnipiac Chronicle'', the official newspaper of the school, openly criticized a university policy that forbade the ''Chronicle'' from publishing news online before the content was published in the weekly [[newspaper|print edition]]. &lt;!--Comment from QU--&gt; Braff wrote an [[editorial]] about the policy and also gave an interview to the ''[[Republican-American]]'' criticizing it.
Manuel Carreiro, Quinnipiac's vice president and dean of students, then sent a letter to Braff in November, telling him that his public disagreement with school policies &quot;will seriously place your position and organization at risk with the university.&quot; Braff received an $8,000 annual stipend for his position, and the university said that its employees have more of a responsibility than other students to uphold policies. But Lynn Bushnell, QU's vice president for public affairs, denied threatening to fire Braff for disagreeing with school policies.
Braff and the ''Chronicle'' staff were also openly critical of a public relations policy requiring all news media inquiries and questions (including those from the ''Chronicle'') for administrators to be sent, via e-mail, to the university's public relations department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/02editorct.html | work=The New York Times | title=A Student Editor Finds Himself at the Center of the News | first=Jeff | last=Holtz | date=2007-12-02 | accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinnipiac officials agreed to discuss the policies with students, and eventually decided that making the ''Chronicle'' independent from the university would be the best idea. The school set forth a plan of action, which included the university appointing editors for the 2008-2009 academic year. Angry with this plan, Braff and other staff agreed to leave the ''Chronicle'' at the end of the spring 2008 semester, and all applicants for the editor positions withdrew their applications.

Former ''Chronicle'' staffers came back in Fall 2008 with ''Quad News'', an independent newspaper with only a [[online newspaper|website]] and no print edition. Plans are to incorporate ''Quad News'' as its own business venture run on [[advertising]] revenue.
''Quad News'' immediately faced opposition from the university. Staffers learned in September that university officials had instructed all varsity coaches, staff and athletes not to speak to ''Quad News'' reporters. 
Shortly after, officials threatened to shut down the university's chapter of the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] (SPJ), claiming that they violated school policy by using their meetings as a cover for ''Quad News'' meetings. The ''Quad News'' staff had used two SPJ meetings to meet,&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.quadnews.net/media/storage/paper1368/news/2008/09/09/News/Quad-News.Statement-3429336.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; after the university took away ''Quad News'' meeting reservation, citing the fact that the organization was not a university-recognized club. ''Quad News'' promptly stopped their meetings with SPJ.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usnews.com/blogs/paper-trail/2008/09/22/the-quinnipiac-student-journalism-showdown.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The move prompted a public letter from national SPJ leaders, expressing concern over the university's actions.
Both staffs recognize the other publication as legitimate and have wished each other luck in their friendly competition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.splc.org/newsflash.asp?id=1810&lt;/ref&gt;
