With partner  [[Rena Inoue]], he is a two-time  [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. national champion]]. Inoue and Baldwin are the first skaters to perform a [[axel jump|throw triple axel]] in competition.

==Personal life==
Baldwin comes from a family of skaters. His father, John Baldwin Sr, competed as a single skater in the 1960s. His brother Don Baldwin competed in singles as well.

Baldwin proposed to his skating partner [[Rena Inoue]] in January 2008.

==Career==
John Baldwin originally competed in both singles and pairs. With partner [[Tristan Colell]], he competed at the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships]].

Baldwin was a veteran single skater, having competed at every national championship from his win at the novice level in 1987 through 2000. His best finish at Nationals as a senior was 9th in 1995.

His father, who was a skating coach, arranged a tryout between Baldwin and [[Rena Inoue]], a Japanese skater living in America. Inoue and Baldwin tried out and agreed to form the partnership. They began competing together in 2000.

They placed 11th at the [[2001 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. The following season, they won the pewter medal at the [[2002 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. They were sent to the [[2002 Four Continents Championships]], their first international competition together, and placed 7th.

In the 2002-2003 season, they competed on the Grand Prix. Returning to Nationals, they won the bronze medal. They withdrew from the [[2003 Four Continents Championships]], but placed 10th at the [[2003 World Figure Skating Championships]].

In the 2003-2004 season, they improved on their Grand Prix results and won their first national title. They placed 4th at the [[2004 Four Continents Championships]] and repeated their 10th place finish at the [[2004 World Figure Skating Championships]].

In the 2004-2005 season, they medaled for the first time on the Grand Prix and qualified for the Grand Prix Final, where they placed 6th. They won the silver medal at the [[2005 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] and placed 11th at the [[2005 World Figure Skating Championships]].

In the 2005-2006 season, Inoue and Baldwin medaled on the Grand Prix. At the [[2006 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]], Inoue and Baldwin became the first pair to successfully perform a throw triple [[Axel jump|Axel]] in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2006-01-13-pairs-free-skate_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Gary | last1=Mihoces | title=A first in pairs skating? | date=26 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They went on to the [[2006 Four Continents Championships]], which they won.  At the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], they made Olympic and international history when they landed the throw triple axel for the first time in international competition. They placed 7th overall. At the [[2006 World Figure Skating Championships]], they placed 4th.

In the 2006-2007 season, Inoue and Baldwin won the gold medal at the [[2006 Skate America]] after winning the short program and placing second in the free skate. They won the silver medal at [[2006 Skate Canada International]] the next week; and then won the silver at [[2006 TrophÃ©e Eric Bompard]] one week later. They qualified for the [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]], and while in St. Petersburg for that competition, Baldwin was abducted, assaulted and robbed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Elliott | first=Helene | title=Mugging leaves Baldwin recovering but still shaken | newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=23 January 2007| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/23/sports/sp-elliott23 | accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he and Inoue were still able to compete, and finished fourth. At the [[2007 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]], they won the silver medal. They placed 8th at the [[2007 World Figure Skating Championships]].

In the 2007-2008 season, Inoue and Baldwin sat out the Grand Prix series, choosing to skate in shows instead. Returning to competition at the [[2008 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]], they won the silver medal. While they were taking their bows following their free skate, Baldwin proposed marriage to Rena on the ice and she accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/feb/02/sports/sp-elliott2 After their skate, the answer is yes - Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20174124,00.html Olympic Skaters Get Engaged on Ice]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/20080127-9999-1s27zeigler.html Baldwin wins Inoue's heart with proposal]&lt;/ref&gt; Inoue and Baldwin competed at the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships]], where they placed 10th.

Inoue and Baldwin were assigned to the [[2008 Skate America]], where they placed 5th, and the [[2008 NHK Trophy]], where they won the silver medal, for the 2008-2009 Grand Prix Season.
