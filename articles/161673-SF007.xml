'''''Moria''''' is a [[roguelike]] [[personal computer game|computer game]] based heavily on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The game's objective is to kill a [[Balrog]], presumably [[Durin's Bane]], deep within the [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Mines of Moria]].  A later port of Moria called ''Umoria'' (UNIX Moria) inspired the ''[[Angband (video game)|Angband]]'' roguelike game. This game influenced the preliminary design of [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s ''[[Diablo (video game)|Diablo]]''.&lt;ref name=escapist48&gt;&quot;[The idea for ''Diablo''] was modified over and over until it solidified when [Dave Brevik] was in college and got hooked on â¦ ''Moria/Angband''.&quot; {{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_48/289-Secret-Sauce-The-Rise-of-Blizzard |title=Secret Sauce: The Rise of Blizzard |accessdate=2007-12-24 |last=Pitts |first=Russ |coauthors= |date=2006-06-06 |work=The Escapist |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original version was written at the [[University of Oklahoma]] by Robert Alan Koeneke and Jimmey Wayne Todd, after they became hooked on ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]'' but could not run it on the [[VAX-11]]/780 minicomputer to which they had access.

Version 1.0 was written in [[OpenVMS|VMS]] [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and completed in the summer of 1983. From around 1985 the [[source code]] was widely distributed under a license that permitted sharing and modification but not commercial use. Koeneke's last release was ''Moria 4.7'' in 1986 or 1987, although more recent versions have been compiled by a variety of authors. ''Moria'' inspired a number of derivative versions. Jim E. Wilson created ''Umoria'', a modified version in [[C (programming language)|C]] for [[Unix|UNIX]] and [[MS-DOS]]; Umoria later became [[Free Software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]], through the work of the free-moria project. At the [[University of Washington]] a modified Pascal version named ''Imoria'' was developed, which has been ported to C by Steve Kertes.

The current maintainer of Moria is David Grabiner.

==Gameplay==
''Moria'' begins with creation of a character. The player first chooses a &quot;race&quot; from the following: Human, Half-Elf, Elf, Halfling, Gnome, Dwarf, Half-Orc, Half-Troll. Racial selection determines base [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] and [[Character class|class]] availability. One then selects the character's &quot;class&quot; from the following: Warrior, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Ranger, Paladin. Class further determines statistics, as well as the abilities acquired during gameplay. Mages, Rangers, and Rogues can learn magic; Priests and Paladins can learn prayers. Warriors possess no additional abilities.

The player begins the game with a limited number of items on a town level of six shops: a General Store, an Armory, a Weaponsmith, a Temple, an Alchemy shop, and a Magic-Users store.  A staircase on this level descends into a series of randomly generated underground mazes. Deeper levels contain more powerful monsters and better treasures. Each time the player ascends or descends a staircase, a new level is created and the old one discarded; only the town persists throughout the game.

Like in most [[roguelike|roguelikes]], it is impossible to re-load from a save if your character dies, as the game saves the state only upon exit, preventing save-scumming that is a key strategy in most computer games that allow saving.

The balrog (represented by the upper-case letter B) is encountered at the deepest depths of the dungeon.  Once the balrog has been killed, the game has been won, and no further saving of the game is possible.
