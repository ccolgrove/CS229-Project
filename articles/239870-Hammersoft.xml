The '''University of Pittsburgh''', commonly referred to as '''Pitt''', is a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787â1987&quot;/&gt; research university located in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, United States. Founded as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 on what was then the American frontier, Pitt is one of the oldest continuously chartered institutions of higher education in the United States.  Pitt evolved into the Western University of Pennsylvania with an alteration to its charter in 1819, and upon relocating to its current campus in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1908, the school received its current moniker, the University of Pittsburgh. For most of its history Pitt was a private institution, until it became part of the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787â19871&quot;/&gt;

Pitt has consistently placed in the top cluster of U.S. public research universities and among the overall top 25 research universities according to the ''[[Center for Measuring University Performance]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;TheCenterRankings&quot;/&gt; is listed as one of ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'''s top  20 public universities,&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews2010public&quot;/&gt; and has been listed among the best colleges for the quality of life of its students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mucha&quot;/&gt;  Pitt has also been named as a &quot;best value&quot; by various publications,&lt;ref name=&quot;USNewsBV&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KiplingerBV&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRbestvalue&quot;/&gt; and has appeared in multiple rankings of the world's top universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;USUnivRankings_ARWU_W&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GUR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HEEACT&quot;/&gt;

Pitt is among the nation's and world's most active research institutions as evidenced by its $642&amp;nbsp;million in annual research expenditures, its standing among the top five schools in the amount of [[National Institutes of Health]] research allocations, and its election as one of the 61 North American members of the [[Association of American Universities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 Chancellor&quot;/&gt; Pitt and its [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine|medical school]] are also closely affiliated with the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]], one of the nation's leading academic medical centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;UT UPMC HonorRoll&quot;/&gt;

Pitt is popularly recognized for its centerpiece building, the [[Cathedral of Learning]], for its central role in developing the first polio vaccine,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787â19872&quot;/&gt; and for fielding nationally competitive [[NCAA Division I]] [[Pittsburgh Panthers|athletic programs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN.com&quot;/&gt;

==History of the University==

{{Main|History of the University of Pittsburgh}}

===The founding===
Founded by [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]] as '''Pittsburgh Academy''' in 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the few universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the United States. It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S. west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787â1987&quot;/&gt; The school began its life as a preparatory school, presumably in a [[Log Cabin (University of Pittsburgh)|log cabin]], possibly as early as 1770&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual catalog of the Western University of Pennsylvania, Year Ending 1905&quot;/&gt; in Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early Schools&quot;/&gt;  Hugh Henry Brackenridge sought and obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] that was passed by the assembly on February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=&quot;The history of Pittsburgh: its rise and progress&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Through one hundred and fifty years: the University of Pittsburgh&quot;/&gt;  A brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;owl1909&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;owl1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alberts&quot;/&gt; The small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rev. John Taylor: the first rector of Trinity Episcopal Church of Pittsburgh and his commonplace book&quot;/&gt;

===The Western University===
Within a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status. The school took the name the '''Western University of Pennsylvania''', or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Celebration of the One Hundred and Twenty-Fifth Anniversary: History of the University&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Through One Hundred and Fifty Years: The University of Pittsburgh&quot;/&gt; By 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown [[Pittsburgh]]. By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional  liberal education in favor of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|state legislature's]] desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to  remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberts17&quot;/&gt; It was also during this era that founder of [[Mellon Bank]], [[Thomas Mellon]] (Class of 1837), graduated and later taught at WUP.&lt;ref name=&quot;owl1909&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;owl1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alberts&quot;/&gt;

===Fires===
[[Image:Pitt1833.jpg|thumb|right|Western University of Pennsylvania, the previous name of Pitt, is depicted in this 1833 oil painting at its location on 3rd Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh.]]
The University's buildings, along with most of its records and files, were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1845 that wiped out 20 square blocks of Pittsburgh. Classes were temporarily held in Trinity Church until a new building was constructed on Duquesne Way (on what was the site of the former [[Horne's]] department store). Only four years later, in 1849, this building also was destroyed by fire. Due to the catastrophic nature of these fires, operations were suspended for a few years to allow the University time to regroup and rebuild. By 1854, WUP had erected a new building on the corner of Ross and Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) streets (site of the present day [[Pittsburgh City-County Building|City-County building]]) and classes resumed in 1855. It is during this era, in 1867, that [[Samuel Pierpoint Langley]], astronomer, inventor, aviation pioneer and future Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], was chosen as director of the [[Allegheny Observatory]] that was donated to WUP in 1865. Langley was professor of astronomy and physics and remained at WUP until 1891, when he was succeeded by another prominent astronomer, [[James Edward Keeler|James Keeler]]. Growing quickly during this period, WUP outgrew its downtown facilities and the university moved its campus to [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]] (present-day [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;owl1909&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;owl1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alberts&quot;/&gt;

===A move north===
[[Image:Pitt1890to1909.jpg|thumb|right|Western University of Pennsylvania's campus on Observatory Hill on Pittsburgh's North Side from 1890 to 1909]]
The University eventually found itself on a {{convert|10|acre|ha|sing=on}} site on the North Side's [[Observatory Hill (Pittsburgh)|Observatory Hill]] at the location of its [[Allegheny Observatory]]. There, it constructed two new buildings, Science Hall and Main Hall, that were occupied by 1889 and 1890 respectively. During this era, the first collegiate football team was formed at Pitt in 1889. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated into the University. By 1893, the University had graduated its first African-American, William Dammond.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt History â 1893: William Hunter Dammond&quot;/&gt; In 1895, WUP established its School of Law and [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[George Westinghouse]] were elected to the Board of Trustees, where they joined [[Andrew Mellon]] who was elected in 1894. The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the University in 1896. In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the University.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt History â 1898: Margaret and Stella Stein&quot;/&gt;  During this period, University engineering professor [[Reginald Fessenden]] was conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting. By 1904, playing at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]], the University had its first undefeated football team.&lt;ref name=&quot;owl1909&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;owl1910&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alberts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt History â 1906: Reginald Fessenden&quot;/&gt;

===A new name and home===
[[File:Thaw1913.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thaw Hall]], circa 1910]]
Citing a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the '''University of Pittsburgh''' in the summer of 1908. During this time, the University had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the North Side of Pittsburgh and its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years. To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought {{convert|43|acre|m2}} of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Owl&quot;/&gt; The initial campus plan for the University centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by [[Henry Hornbostel]] for 30 buildings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt: the story of the University of Pittsburgh, 1787â1987&quot;/&gt; However, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only [[Thaw Hall]] remains today. It was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor [[Samuel McCormick]],  would again fend off pressures to abandon the school's commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training. During his administration, McCormick would also lead the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as began institutional support of  athletics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt: The Story of the University of Pittsburgh 1787â19873&quot;/&gt;

===A national landmark===
[[File:1935CathedralofLearningOwl.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The [[Cathedral of Learning]] circa 1935]]
In the 1920s, new university chancellor [[John Gabbert Bowman]] declared that he had a vision for a centerpiece &quot;tall building&quot; for the university. The {{convert|14|acre}} Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] plan that today comprises the [[Cathedral of Learning]], [[Heinz Memorial Chapel]], [[Stephen Foster Memorial]], and [[Clapp Hall]] buildings. By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by [[Charles Klauder]] for the &quot;tall building&quot;: an attention-getting {{convert|535|ft|m|sing=on}} tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the &quot;character that ought to be in an educated man.&quot;  The building's &quot;parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness&quot; and it would &quot;unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character.&quot;  The Cathedral is &quot;cut off&quot; flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending. The building was financed by donors as well as a campaign to collect dimes from local school children. Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the [[Great Depression]] intervened, the [[Cathedral of Learning]], on which construction was begun in 1926, started hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937. Today, it remains the second tallest university building in the world and contains an equally-impressive interior highlighted by a half-acre (2,000 mÂ²) Gothic hall Commons Room with {{convert|52|ft|m|sing=on}} tall arches currently surrounded by 27&amp;nbsp;[[Nationality Rooms]], however eight more Nationality Rooms are in the making.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nationality Rooms - rooms in planning&quot;/&gt; 

===Development of the polio vaccine===
[[Image:SalkatPitt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jonas Salk]] developed the first polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh.]]
In the early 20th century, epidemics of [[poliomyelitis|polio]] began to hit the United States and other industrialized countries. As hospital wards filled with patients in [[iron lung]]s, and tens of thousands were left disabled, fear of contracting polio grew rampant and led to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile, [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]] had set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now [[Salk Hall]]. By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the [[polio vaccine|vaccine]] developed by [[Jonas Salk]] and his team of Pitt researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by ''95 percent''. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering Polio: Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Salk Polio Vaccine&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Shot Heard 'Round the World&quot;/&gt;

===State relations===
In 1966, Pitt was designated by [[Pennsylvania]] as a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] university. As such, Pitt receives public funds ($185.4&amp;nbsp;million in fiscal year 2011) covering about 9% of its operating budget and offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents. Pitt remains under independent control, but is typically categorized as a public university. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] running back [[Tony Dorsett]] and continued success in the 1980s with players such as [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Dan Marino]]. In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of [[organ transplantation]] was conducted by [[Thomas Starzl]], establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation. In 1991, long-time chancellor [[Wesley Posvar]] retired after 24 years in office. His administration is best known for elimination of the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school's prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630&amp;nbsp;million and its endowment tripled to $257&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitt&quot;/&gt;
[[Mark Nordenberg]] has been chancellor of the University since 1995 and is leading Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over half-way toward achieving its goal&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt Giving: Office of Institutional Advancement&quot;/&gt; and a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;University of Pittsburgh Announces 12-Year Facilities Plan To Support Programmatic Direction&quot;/&gt; In 2010, Pitt's $2.033&amp;nbsp;billion endowment ranked 28th among all colleges and universities and 7th nationally among public universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Endowment&quot;/&gt; Pitt's endowment now stands at $2.545&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Endowment update&quot;/&gt;

==Location and campus==
[[Image:HeinzChapelSouth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Heinz Memorial Chapel]]]]
The University of Pittsburgh's main campus comprises approximately 132 urban acres (0.53&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) located in Pittsburgh's historic [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood. Much of the campus, including its centerpiece 42-story [[Cathedral of Learning]], falls within the [[Schenley Farms Historic District|Oakland Civic Center/Schenley Farms National Historic District]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NRHP-districts&quot;/&gt; The campus contains an eclectic mix of architecture that includes Greek revival, Neogothic, Italian Renaissance, and modern. It has been termed &quot;a theme park of replica buildings, representing the architecture of the past speaking to the present.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weighing in on Pitt's eclectic architecture&quot;/&gt; The campus has won multiple Green Star Awards from the [[Professional Grounds Management Society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt Wins Grounds Services Award&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PGMS Green Star Awards: Urban University Grounds: University of Pittsburgh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PGMS News - PGMS Salutes Grounds Management Excellence; College and University Grounds Lead the Way&quot;/&gt;

The University of Pittsburgh's main campus can be thought to be made up of four contiguous sections: upper (sports complexes, [[Upper campus residence halls (University of Pittsburgh)|residence halls]]); mid ([[Benedum Hall|Benedum]], [[Chevron Science Center|Chevron]], [[Allen Hall (University of Pittsburgh)|Allen]] and [[Thaw Hall]]s); lower ([[Cathedral of Learning]], [[William Pitt Union|Union]], [[Wesley W. Posvar Hall|Posvar Hall]]); and on the west end of campus, the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center|medical center complex]]. The campus is generally bordered by Darragh Street/McKee Place to the west and Bellefield Avenue/Dithridge Street to the east; Forbes and Fifth avenues traverse the campus from west to east. Although generally within walking distance, the university also runs a [[University of Pittsburgh Transportation System|bus and shuttle service]] between various campus locations and bordering neighborhoods.

The main campus abuts or is within a short walking distance of many recreational, cultural, and educational institutions that also populate the Oakland neighborhood.   The campus is directly adjacent to [[Schenley Plaza]], the main branch of the [[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Public Library]], the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art]], and the Carnegie Music Hall. [[Carlow University]] is just west of campus, adjacent to the University's medical center complexes. [[Carnegie Mellon University]], [[Central Catholic High School (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania)|Central Catholic High School]] and historic [[Schenley Park]], site of the [[Phipps Conservatory &amp; Botanical Gardens]], lie across [[Junction Hollow]] on the east end. Some Pitt professors also hold adjunct professorships at Carnegie Mellon and ''vice-versa''.

===Panthers===
{{Main|Panthers of Pittsburgh}}

In the fall of 1909, the University of Pittsburgh was the first college or university to adopt the panther (''[[Cougar|Puma concolor]]'') as its mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Panther&quot;/&gt; Popular as photo sites, there are ten representations of Panthers in and about Pitt's campus, and ten more painted fiberglass panthers placed around the campus by the Pitt Student Government.

Pittâs history of commitment to international education is illustrated by its unique collection of 27 [[Nationality Rooms]] on the first and third floors of the [[Cathedral of Learning]]. As a further demonstration of this commitment, Pitt is one of the countryâs leading producers of both Fulbright scholars and Peace Corps volunteers&lt;ref name=&quot;chancellor-2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;University Center for International Studies (UCIS)&quot;/&gt; and one of less than 20 American universities to claim five or more area studies programs that have been competitively designated as National Resource Centers by the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pitt-fall-07&quot;/&gt;

Pitt's National Resource Centers include Asian,  European, Latin American, Russian and East European, and Global studies,&lt;ref name=&quot;ritchie&quot;/&gt; as well as Pitt's International Business Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitt-fall-07&quot;/&gt; In addition, Pitt's Asian Studies Center has been awarded status as a [[Confucius Institute]] by the Chinese Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinese Ministry of Education Awards University of Pittsburgh First Confucius Institute in Pennsylvania&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Confucius Institute at the University of Pittsburgh&quot;/&gt; Further, Pitt is home to one of just ten European Union Centers of Excellence in the U.S., funded by the [[European Commission]].

The [[University of Pittsburgh Center for International Studies|University Center for International Studies]] (UCIS) coordinates international education curricula, centers on topical specializations in international studies, and the centers for area studies, including the National Resource Centers, among existing faculty and departments throughout the university. It does not itself give degrees but awards certificates of attainment to degree candidates in the University's schools and also operates certificate programs in African Studies (undergraduate) and in Global Studies (undergraduate &amp; graduate).&lt;ref name=&quot;about-ucis&quot;/&gt; UCIS also operates the Study Abroad Office,&lt;ref name=&quot;Study Abroad Office&quot;/&gt; Nationality Rooms and Intercultural Exchange Programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;about nationality rooms&quot;/&gt;

Pitt's study abroad program, under the auspices of UCIS, helps to facilitate student study in over a hundred different countries, and oversees a variety of programs including the Panther Programs, which are course taught abroad that have been developed and are accompanied by faculty of the university; two-way exchange agreements with foreign institutions; and Pitt-recognized, third-party exchange programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Study Abroad Program Options&quot;/&gt; The university also offers several study abroad scholarships, including those through the Nationality Rooms program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scholarships for Study Abroad&quot;/&gt; In addition, following the decision to end a 24-year sponsorship of the [[Semester at Sea]] program due to academic, administrative and safety concerns,&lt;ref name=&quot;Provost explains decision to drop Semester at Sea&quot;/&gt;  Pitt has created a Multi-region Academic Program (PittMAP) that involves international travel, accompanied by university faculty, to three different continents for the comparative study of one of six rotating global study themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt Map Program&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;robinet&quot;/&gt;

The University of Pittsburgh has had many individuals lead it throughout its history. During the academy days, the title of Principal was worn by the head of the school. Due to fires, early records are incomplete. When Pittsburgh Academy transitioned into the Western University, the title was changed to Chancellor.  This title has lasted except for a brief change during Wesley Posvar's administration when it was transiently switched to President.  Samuel McCormick oversaw the name change from the Western University of Pennsylvania to the University of Pittsburgh in 1908 and is therefore listed with the chancellors of the University of Pittsburgh. Acting chancellors are also included in the list below.
