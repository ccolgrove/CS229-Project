The '''HP Pavilion TX1000 Series Tablet PC''' is a series of [[Laptop|notebook]] computers from [[Hewlett Packard]] introduced in February 2007. These notebooks are designed for [[Windows Vista]]. The TX series uses the [[AMD Turion 64]] X2 series of processors. This series has a 12.1-inch [[touch screen]] and a DVD+RW; it competed well with the top-of-the-line tablets at the time of its release. All models came with an [[NVIDIA GeForce]] Go 6150 graphics system, which features 128 MB of integrated graphics and an extra shared graphics memory of up to 916 MB.
This model has been superseded by the [[HP Touchsmart tx2]] Series, and subsequently by the [[HP Touchsmart tm2]].

== Criticism ==
Within a few months of release of the tx1000 series, numerous technical failures were reported on internet blogs, review sites and HP's own support websites. These included webcam, audio, speaker, BIOS, power management, overheating, booting, and wireless adapter problems. Some were addressed in a timely manner with [[Device driver|driver]] updates, but other users were still forced to turn the notebook on and off repeatedly until it booted up, while others were left with a non-working &quot;bricked&quot; unit. HP released an updated model, the HP Pavilion tx2, which in turn was followed by the HP TouchSmart tm2. HP never issued a recall for its tx1 model.
