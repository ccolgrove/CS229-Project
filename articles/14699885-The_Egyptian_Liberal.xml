'''Tarek Heggy''' ({{lang-ar|Ø·Ø§Ø±Ù Ø­Ø¬Ù}}, {{IPA-arz|ËtË¤ÉËÉ¾Ë¤eÊ ËÄ§eÉ¡É¡i|IPA}}; born October 12, 1950, [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]]) is a  [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[author]], political thinker and international petroleum strategist. His extensive writings advocate the values of modernity, [[democracy]], tolerance, and [[women's rights]] in the [[Middle East]] â advancing them as universal values essential to the region's progress. As one of the contemporary leading Egyptian liberal theoreticians, he has lectured at universities throughout the world, including [[Oxford University]], the [[University of Tokyo]], the [[University of Melbourne]], [[Sydney University]],  [[Princeton University]], [[Columbia University]], [[King's College London]], [[Colorado University]], [[Colorado School of Mines]], [[The Hayek Institute]] (Vienna), [[Erasmus University]] (The Netherlands), the [[American University in Cairo]], and the [[University of California Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarek-heggy.com/ Tarek Heggy - An Egyptian Creative liberal intellectual, One of the most quoted Arab thinkers on the web&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he has lectured at the [[European University]] (Rome), [[John Cabot University]] (Rome), and the [[University of Calabria]] (Italy) as well as Marrakesh (Morocco), Fes (Morocco), Zaytouna (Tunis) and Manouba (Tunis) universities. Due to his knowledge of the Middle East, he has been called upon to speak at various international institutions and think tanks, such as the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Hudson Institute]], the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]], the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], and the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. Because of his intellectual project advocating universal human values, he also participates in international organizations addressing the holocaust and genocide, such as [[Project Aladdin]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.projetaladin.org/en/why-this-web-site/committee-on-conscience.html?searched=tarek+heggy&amp;advsearch=oneword&amp;highlight=ajaxSearch_highlight+ajaxSearch_highlight1+ajaxSearch_highlight2&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stockholm International Forum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preventgenocide.org/prevent/conferences/StockholmDeclaration28Jan2004.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarek Heggy's main themes are the need for economic, political, cultural and educational reforms in [[Egypt]] and the Middle East. His liberal voice is part of the small but growing minority that calls for self criticism and massive reforms and that frankly admits the failures of the [[political ideologies]]/dogmas dominating Egypt and the [[Arab world]]. Moreover, this voice calls the conspiracy theories and overblown rhetoric that pervade the region signs of a cultural crisis that needs resolution. Finally, Tarek Heggy advocates the imperative need to develop a fair political ending to the Arab-Israeli conflict to enable all societies in the Middle East to move towards a pro-active phase of economic and social development.

== Biography ==

Tarek Heggy was born in 1950, into the [[Egypt]]ian upper-middle class and hometown of his parents, [[Port Said]].  Both his father and mother were fortunate enough to be highly educated, intellectual people who had been widely exposed to Western culture and civilization. They inculcated within him a love of reading and an appreciation of languages at a young age.  As citizens of Port Said, Heggyâs parents were the offspring of the [[Suez Canal]] community and of an otherwise unique openness to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tarek-heggy.com/TV-interviews.htm Tarek Heggy - An Egyptian Creative liberal intellectual, One of the most quoted Arab thinkers on the web&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== What others say ==

* &quot;A courageous and distinctive voice from Egypt.&quot; Tarek Heggy provides &quot;a candid and provocative inside view of the current problems of the Arab world&quot;. [[Bernard Lewis]], Cleveland E. Dodge Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies, [[Princeton University]].

* &quot;Tarek Heggy is perhaps the Arab world's leading intellectual light and certainly one of its most prolific thinkers and writers. (H)is latest work reminds us all once more of his originality of thought, the breadth and depth of his learning and his intellectual courage&quot;. [[Efraim Karsh]], Middle East and Mediterranean Studies, [[King's College London]].

* &quot;Tarek Heggy is one of the most creative and prolific writers in the Arab world. His writings probe the political and social limits and present a refreshing message of self-reliance that challenges the prevailing sense that regional ills are largely made abroad&quot;. [[Shibley Telhami]], Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and development at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and Senior Fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]].

* &quot;Tarek Heggy can rightly be considered the liberal conscience, in the nineteenth-century British sense, of modern Arab society. He challenges the notion of an Arab civilization as desirable paradigm with its unique traditions. Instead, he maintains that universal values like humanism, progress, responsibility and choice produce democracy, civil society as well as cultural and economic integration.  He argues that modern Arab society's inability or unwillingness to integrate those universal values has led to its failure in achieving results evident in the West as well as in certain successfully developing economies.  Heggy's courageous indictment of religious obscurantism, political authoritarianism, bureaucratic sycophancy, and collective cynicism paves the way toward his vision of a shared global heritage informed by relevant education systems, the work ethic, efficient time management, and meritocracies.&quot; Jean-Marc Ran Oppenheim, [[Teachers College, Columbia University]].

* âHaving discovered that there is no equivalent in the Arabic language, classical or colloquial, for the word âcompromiseâ, Tarek Heggy invented his own âcultural compromiseâ.  This led him to advocate cultural tolerance and acceptance of the âOtherâ, and to argue for progress as a human product, modernity, the universality of science and knowledge, democracy and civil society. An academic, intellectual, economist and one of the world's top petroleum strategists, he is also a managerial wizard. Many consider his books on management a recipe for curing the ills of Egypt.&quot; [[Adel Darwish]]

* &quot;Tarek Heggy's book is one of the most interesting and important works to come out of the Arab world in a long time. At the very moment when the debate over change or continuity, democracy or dictatorship is at its height, Heggy brilliantly analyses the causes and solutions of Arab problems and paradoxes.&quot; Professor [[Barry Rubin]], Director, Global Research in International Affairs Center and Editor, [[Middle East Review of International Affairs]].
