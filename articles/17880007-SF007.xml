'''Acronis True Image''' is disk imaging software, (see &quot;[[Disk image]]&quot;) developed by [[Acronis]], that creates backups and recovers PC systems. The software allows a user to create an image of a disk while it is running [[Microsoft Windows]] or offline by booting from [[CD]]/[[DVD]], [[USB flash drive]]s, [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]], or other [[bootable]] media. As a disk imaging software, True Image can restore the previously captured image to another disk, replicating the structure and contents to the new disk, also allowing disk cloning and partition resizing, as well if the new disk is of different capacity. The backups are in a proprietary and non-documented file format which uses a &lt;tt&gt;.tib&lt;/tt&gt; [[filename extension]].

==History==
True Image has a [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] driven interface,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pocket-lint.co.uk/reviews/review.phtml/2105/3129/acronis-true-image-pc-software.phtml |title=Acronis True Image 10 (home) - PC Review |author=Patrick, Stephen |publisher=Pocket Lint |accessdate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received positive and mixed reviews from both editors and users alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Acronis True Image Reviewer's Comments | date= | publisher= | url =http://data-backup-software-review.toptenreviews.com/acronis-true-image-review.html | work =Top Ten Reviews | pages = | accessdate = 2008-05-27 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first version of True Image was launched into the market of drive backup software in 2002 and could create a drive image that was running without shutting down to DOS mode.

The other features were an ability to write an image to DVDs, a drive image creation within Windows and support for a wide range of storage options. 

Acronis True Image 2010, added a new option of online backup that saves userâs backups to a secure remote location.

==Operation==
As a disk imaging software, True Image offers functionality such as restoring data or creating a drive image without rebooting the system. In case of operating system error or [[hard disk failure]], the PC can be booted to the Acronis Startup Recovery Manager, which returns the system to a previous point in time.
True Image creates exact backups of a hard drive sector-by-sector, therefore providing faster restore of userâs operating systems, data, settings, applications, etc. 
The program can back up a system hard drive while the OS is running. It recovers a computer after the system crash and boots it by pressing the F11 key.
Acronis True Image offers several different options for system recovery, including the retrieval of lost files or other chunks of data, as well as entire system recovery due to corruption or failure. The following is a quick list of methods:

* True Image can access files within an existing image file by mounting the image file as if it were a disk, in either read-only or read-write mode. This enables the user to quickly copy data files from the image file back to the local system. A virtual device driver must be installed in the operating system in order to use the mounting feature, but this driver is installed during the original installation of True Image. Separately, files can be read from and, in read-write mode, written to the image, which effectively creates an incremental file, and has the advantage of leaving the original image files untouched by saving the changes in a new file.
* True Image offers a bootable media wizard, which creates a recovery environment to CD or other media, and is used to boot the machine to a proprietary environment for quick recovery.  While this method also provides the ability to recover lost data, the primary focus is restoring the complete system back to a given [[Point-in-time recovery|point in time]] in case of complete failure.

* The [[Acronis Secure Zone]] is a bootable, hidden partition option created and managed by True Image.  This space, which is not accessible to the user or other applications such as [[malware]], is used to store the backup image files.  The Secure Zone can be created as bootable, enabling the user to boot directly into the recovery environment by pressing the F11 key, very useful when the machine doesn't contain an [[optical disk drive]] or other access to external media.

* The recent version of True Image 2010 offers an online backup feature, providing optional off-site data protection and recovery.

==File format==
Acronis states that True Image provides backward compatibility for image files (with the .tib extension) created with a single previous version, that is, images created with an immediate previous version can be successfully restored. Backups are compatible between different editions of True Image; e.g., between True Image Echo Workstation and True Image Echo Enterprise Server, or between Linux and Windows versions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acronis.co.uk/enterprise/support/kb/?aid=477&lt;/ref&gt;
Third-party support include software by [[VMware]], [[VMware Converter]],  which can convert .tib files into files to use in a [[Virtual Machine]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acronis.com/pr/2008/01/pr01-16-wmware-converter.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vmware.com/products/converter/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==

For some users, the &quot;Nonstop Backup&quot; feature in version 2010 and 2011 intermittently pauses, turns off or crashes. Acronis states that the feature is working now. Users disagree.&lt;ref name=&quot;nonstop backup problem&quot;&gt;[http://forum.acronis.com/forum/4580 4580: Nonstop Backup Turns Off For No Reason - ATI Home 2010], Knowledge Base: Acronis Forums&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[ReiserFS]]
* [[Reiser4]]&lt;ref name = &quot;linuxfs&quot; &gt;[http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/faq/linux-file-system/ FAQ: Linux file systems and Linux operating system support&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Virtual memory|Linux Swap]]
In addition to the officially supported filesystems, Acronis True Image also provides raw sector backup and restore options for all other filesystems.  ''''Raw'''' mode provides support for a file system that is corrupt, or that isn't officially supported, by capturing a complete image of all sectors on the disk.  This method results in a larger image file as it isn't able to compress, resize, or selectively restore files on the unrecognized filesystem.
