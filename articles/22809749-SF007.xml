==PiSi package management==
[[PiSi]] (Packages Installed Successfully as Intended, {{IPA-en|ËpiËsiË|}}) is the package management system of Pardus. It is the primary tool for installing, upgrading and removing software packages. PiSi stores and handles the dependencies for the various packages, libraries, and COMAR tasks. &quot;Pisi&quot; is a Turkish word meaning &quot;kitty&quot;, intended as a [[pun]] on the distribution's name.

{{cquote|One of the most revolutionary and innovative changes with Pardus 2009 is the ability of [[delta package]]s, making it unnecessary to download the whole application in an update or upgrade. Consider that the application the user listens to his/her MP3 files has released a new version. It is not necessary to search for, find, download, uninstall the old version and install the new version by clicking many 'Next' buttons. Pardus Package Manager, running on top of PiSi, fetches all updates with the click of a button. In its simplest terms, Package Manager downloads only the 'difference' of the old and new versions, a small delta file in technical terms. With this new feature, updates are now no more than 10 percent of the original package in terms of size. In other terms, Pardus 2009 is the best friend of users with limited internet connectivity, preserving their quota, and as such is a model of efficiency, although delta files have been used by other distributors already.}}

Some features of PiSi include:

* Uses the [[LZMA]] compression algorithm
* Written in Python
* Package sources are written in XML and Python
* Database access implemented with [[Berkeley DB]]
* Integrates low-level and high-level package operations (dependency resolution)
* Framework approach to build applications and tools upon
* Beginning with Pardus 2009, delta packages are on by default.

==YALI==
YALI (Yet Another Linux Installer) is the first Pardus software a user encounters. Basically, it recognizes the hardware and installs Pardus software from installation media (i.e. CD) to a user-selected hard disk partition. YALI can handle resizing of NTFS partitions found on the disk.

==KAPTAN==
KAPTAN is a desktop greeter, which starts at the first start. It allows a user to change the desktop theme, mouse, keyboard and language settings, date and time, KDE menus, wallpaper, Package Manager settings, ''smolt'', number of desktops. ''Kaptan'' means 'captain' in English.&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Wikipedia: [[:w:tr:Kaptan_%28yaz%C4%B1l%C4%B1m%29|Kaptan (yazÄ±lÄ±m)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Ladislav Bodnar, the creator of [[DistroWatch]], wrote in his round-up of Linux/[[Unix-like|*nix]] in 2006 that Pardus is one of the distros he was most impressed by that year &quot;''â¦thanks to unique package management ideas, innovative start-up sequence and general desktop polishâ¦''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bodnar |first=Ladislav |title=Feature: Distributions in 2006 |work=Distrowatch Weekly |issue=182 |publisher=[[Distrowatch]] |date=2006-12-18 |url=http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20061218 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
