'''Huntington University''' is an institution of higher education in [[Huntington, Indiana]], [[United States]], that is affiliated with the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]].

== History ==
The institution opened as &quot;Central College&quot; in 1897. The name changed to &quot;Huntington College&quot; in 1917. Huntington gained accreditation from the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1961, and the institution adopted its current name in 2005.

==Campus==

The Loew [[Botanical Garden]] and [[Arboretum]] was established in 1935. Parts of the original arboretum were flooded in the 1960s to create Lake Sno-Tip. The botanical garden at one time included a specimen of every plant growing in Huntington County, Indiana. The Arboretum and botanical garden are no longer actively cultivated. The school [[herbarium]], founded in 1903, includes approximately 10,000 specimens. Most were collected from Huntington County and the Upper Wabash Valley Basin between 1905 and 1950.

Thornhill Nature Preserve is a {{convert|77|acre|m2|sing=on}} [[nature preserve]] that provides outdoor educational opportunities through the Reiff Nature Center, ropes course, and various community events.

The Merillat Centre for the Arts is a fine arts center that includes the Robert E. Wilson Gallery, as well as the Huntington University departments of art, music, communication, digital media, and theatre.

There are seven dorms on Huntington's campus. They are Wright, Hardy, Roush, Baker, Miller, Meadows and Livingston Halls. Students can also live in Forester Village, an upper class-man apartment complex.

== Controversies ==
In 2004, controversy ensued when Huntington dismissed [[John E. Sanders]], professor of religion and philosophy, following constituent disputes over Sanders' views on [[open theism]] and [[inclusivism]]. Sanders was placed on a one-year full-salary sabbatical, at the end of which his contract was terminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://ub.org/news/Pages/2005NC/reports/22Blair3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some students and faculty protested under the banner of academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/decemberweb-only/12-20-32.0.html&lt;/ref&gt;
