The '''n Series''' is a [[Dell]] product line that does not ship with a pre-installed version of [[Microsoft Windows]]. Apparently prohibited from shipping computers without an [[operating system]] by an existing licensing agreement with [[Microsoft]], Dell instead ships these systems with either the [[open-source]] [[FreeDOS]] operating system or the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] Linux distribution.

The company has come under fire for making the FreeDOS-powered machines no cheaper and more difficult to purchase than identical systems running Windows&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/06/dell_open_pc/ How Dell repels attempts to buy its 'open source' PC | The Register&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dell also offers various [[Dell Precision|Precision]] Workstations with [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] pre-installed. These, like all other products in the Precision series, are marketed at enterprises.
