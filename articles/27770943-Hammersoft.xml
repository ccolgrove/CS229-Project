&quot;'''I've Got Nothing'''&quot; is a song released by the participants of the [[BBC Two]] documentary series ''[[Chartjackers]]'' and is credited as such. The track was produced by university student Marc Dowding and its music video was filmed by [[YouTube]] user [[Charlie McDonnell]]. It was released by the [[record label]] Swinging Mantis on 9 November 2009 exclusively through the [[iTunes Store]]. The single and its release were the end product of a ten-week campaign documented on ''Chartjackers'', which challenged the global [[online community]] to write, record and release a pop song that would make number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song was written entirely through [[crowdsourcing]], with its every aspect, such as the title, lyrics, melody and singers, having been solicited from YouTube users.

&quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; was a [[Charity record|charity single]] released to benefit the UK charity [[Children in Need]]. It was sung by vocalists [[Miranda Chartrand]] and Adam Nichols, both on the record and at live performances. Its music video featured shots of Chartrand and Nichols singing in a [[London]] park with Children in Need mascot Pudsey Bear, as well as video clips submitted by ''Chartjackers'' viewers of themselves miming to the track. The song was generally ignored by music critics and received mostly negative reviewsâit went on to sell a total of 20,000 copies worldwide and earned a chart position of Number 36 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

==Recording and release==
[[Image:Campus-snow.gif|thumb|alt=Photograph of the Caerleon Campus of the University of Wales, Newport.|&quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; was recorded at the [[University of Wales, Newport]].]]
&quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; was produced and co-written by university student Marc Dowding. Dowding learnt about the opportunity through a video posted to the YouTube channel &quot;ChartJackersProject&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Producer Search &amp; Band Auditions!|format=Flash video||publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=22 September 2009|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFjmzMH3lhg|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was offered the job after e-mailing his [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] to a [[BBC Switch]] producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newport&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chartjackersâ hit produced by Creative Newport Student|url=http://citypartners.newport.ac.uk/news/displayStory.aspx?story_id=432|publisher=[[University of Wales, Newport]]|location=[[Newport]]|date=23 October 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wc30aKbm|archivedate=19 February 2011|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chartrand and Nichols travelled to [[Newport]], [[South Wales]] on 7 October to record the single at the recording studio of the [[University of Wales, Newport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxF4BmKDWfM|title=Official Update from 1/2 of the Voices of Chartjackers..

&quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; was leaked to the internet during October 2009, before being officially released a month later by record label Swinging Mantis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Official Chart with Reggie Yates, 15/11/2009|publisher=[[BBC Radio 1]]|location=[[London]]|date=15 November 2009|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nvd1y|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wc35ksrY|archivedate=19 February 2011|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Swinging Mantis was a small record label, the budget for &quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; was limited, so a physical version of the single was never made available.

&quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; was largely ignored by the [[mainstream media]] and did not receive many reviewsâthe reviews that it did receive from critics were generally negative. British music website [[Popjustice]] called the effort &quot;very bad&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Subtle hints that Simon Cowell might not always be musically motivated|url=http://www.popjustice.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4212|publisher=[[Popjustice]]|date=16 November 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wc3PkIws|archivedate=19 February 2011|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ellie Halfacre of Tower Review explained that &quot;some commented that the melody was bad, and others said it was the lyrics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tower Review&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Halfacre|first=Ellie|title=I've Got Nothing|publisher=Tower Review|date=19 January 2010|url=http://towerreview.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/ive-got-nothing/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wc3SboUZ|archivedate=17 February 2011|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halfacre also questioned whether the project was about self-promotion or charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tower Review&quot;/&gt; David Balls of [[Digital Spy]] gave the single three stars out of five, predicting that it was &quot;unlikely to make much of a top 40 impact&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Music â Single Reviews|last=Balls|first=David|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=9 November 2009|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a186401/chartjackers-ive-got-nothing.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wc3XQ0UR|archivedate=19 February 2011|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Masterton]] of [[Yahoo!

The music video for &quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; was edited by YouTube user [[Charlie McDonnell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 7&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Episode 7|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baXD5a4-yHg|series=[[Chartjackers]]|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=24 October 2009|seriesno=1|number=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows various &quot;ChartJackersProject&quot; viewers miming to the song, interspersed with shots of Chartrand and Nichols singing &quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; in a park. The video was created through [[crowdsourcing]], in a manner similar to the writing of the song itself. On 8 October 2009, viewers were invited via &quot;ChartJackersProject&quot; to film and submit video clips of themselves either singing or clapping along with the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-sTPf0q8cQ|title=Sing-along and Clap-along|date=8 October 2009|format=Flash video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shots of Chartrand and Nichols with an actor dressed as [[Children in Need]] mascot Pudsey Bear were filmed in a park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 7&quot;/&gt; This footage was compiled with some of the clips submitted by viewers and used to construct the final music video, which was shown nationwide on British [[Music television|music channels]] such as [[4Music]] and [[Viva (UK &amp; Ireland)|Viva]].

Many viewers submitted clips that were literal interpretations of the lyrics. For example, some viewers held up medals and trophies for the lyric &quot;won the greatest prize&quot;, others zoomed-in on their own eye during the line &quot;look into my eyes&quot; and others turned off lights for the lyric &quot;the lights are going out&quot;. Most of the shots of Chartrand and Nichols are of them singing &quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; in a park with an actor dressed as Pudsey Bear, but the video also features shots of them eating [[ice cream]], swinging around a lamp post and dancing in front of a tree. The video begins with shots of the duo throwing a [[Football (association football)|football]] back and forth to each other. At 2:03, the video splits into 35 equally sized smaller rectangles, each containing a clip of a &quot;ChartJackersProject&quot; viewer clapping in time with &quot;I've Got Nothing&quot;. Over the next 18 seconds of the song, 11 different sets of 35 viewers (i.e. approximately 385 viewers in total) are shown clapping along with the song. The video also features a cameo from YouTube user [[Peter Oakley]] at 0:06.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYDRWXjJlB4|title=&quot;I've Got Nothing&quot; â ChartJackers Music Video|date=8 November 2009|format=Flash video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
