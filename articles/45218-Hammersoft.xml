'''Sacha Noam Baron Cohen'''&lt;ref name=birthname&gt;{{cite web |title=Baron Cohen, Sacha |publisher=BFI Film &amp; TV Database |url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/837355 |accessdate=6 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 13 October 1971) is an English stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and voice artist. He is most widely known for his portrayal of three unorthodox fictional characters: [[Ali G]], [[Borat Sagdiyev|Borat]], and [[BrÃ¼no (character)|BrÃ¼no]]. In his routines, Baron Cohen's characters interact with unsuspecting people who do not realize they are being set up for comic situations and self-revealing ridicule.

Baron Cohen's work has been recognised with several [[Emmy]] nominations, an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], a [[BAFTA]] award, and a [[Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for his work in the feature film ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]''. After the release of the movie ''Borat'', Baron Cohen stated that because the public had become too familiar with the characters, he would retire Borat and Ali G. Similarly, after the release of ''[[BrÃ¼no]]'', he has stated he would also retire the title character.&lt;ref name=&quot;shed&quot;&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20071221/119828847600.html Yahoo Movies: Sacha Baron Cohen to shed Borat persona for good] Yahoo, 22 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Baron Cohen, the middle of three brothers, was born in [[Hammersmith]], West London. His mother, Daniella (nÃ©e Weiser), was born in Israel, and his father, Gerald, was originally from [[Pontypridd]], Wales.&lt;ref name=wales1&gt;{{cite news|last =|first =|coauthors=|title =Valley G's wicked Welsh rootz| pages=|publisher=BBC News | date =28 March 2002 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1898402.stm| accessdate =22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2010/08/Baron-Cohen.html |title=Moment Magazine |publisher=Momentmag.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two brothers: [[Erran Baron Cohen|Erran]] and Amnon.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2002&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Jay Rayner |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2002/feb/24/foodanddrink.comedy |title=The Observer Profile: Sacha Baron Cohen , Life and style , The Observer |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 4 November 2005|accessdate=7 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family is [[British Jews|Jewish]].&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last = Mount|first = Harry|title = Kazakhstan launches propaganda campaign against Borat | publisher=Telegraph | date = 15 September 2006 |url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/15/wborat15.xml|accessdate = 6 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandmother, who lives in [[Haifa]], Israel, trained as a ballet dancer in Germany.&lt;ref name=maternalg&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Roland|coauthors=|title=Borat's easy ... being me is odd|pages=|work=The Times |location=UK |date=21 January 2007|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article1294842.ece|accessdate=18 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;{{cite news | last = Strauss | first = Neil | title = Sacha Baron Cohen&amp;nbsp;â The Real Borat&amp;nbsp;â Finally Speaks | publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite news|last = Rayner|first = Jay| title = Mutha of invention|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = 24 February 2002|url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,656096,00.html| accessdate = 6 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.momentmag.com/moment/issues/2010/08/Baron-Cohen.html&lt;/ref&gt; Erran is a composer and has worked on several of his films.

==Early roles==
After leaving university, Baron Cohen worked for a time as a [[fashion model]], appearing in many fashion magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt; By the early 1990s, he was hosting a weekly programme on Windsor cable television's local broadcasts with [[Carol Kirkwood]], who later became a [[BBC]] weather forecaster. In 1995, [[Channel 4]] was planning a replacement for its series ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]]'', and disseminated an open call for new television presenters. Baron Cohen sent in a tape of himself in the character of Kristo, a fictional television reporter from [[Albania]] (who developed into the Kazakh [[Borat Sagdiyev]]), which caught the attention of a producer. Baron Cohen hosted Pump TV from 1995â1996. In 1996, he began presenting the youth chat programme [[F2F (GranadaTalk TV Show)|F2F]] for [[Granada Talk TV]]. The late nineties saw Baron Cohen make his first feature film appearance in the British comedy ''[[The Jolly Boys' Last Stand]]'', then in 2000 Baron Cohen played the part of [[Super Greg]] for a series of TV advertisements for [[Lee Jeans]] which never aired, yet the website for Super Greg created an internet sensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | writer=[[Kerry Lauerman|Lauerman, Kerry]] | title=It's Borat Day! | publisher=Salon | date=3 November 2006 | work=Video Dog | url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/video_dog/comedy/2006/11/03/supergreg/index.html | accessdate=12 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also attended Ecole Philippe Gaulier, studying under [[Philippe Gaulier]] whom he credits with enabling him to find the play and pleasure to create characters such as Ali G and Borat.

==Characters==
===Ali G===
[[Image:AliG-Harv.jpg|thumb|upright|Baron Cohen as [[Ali G]], offering a speech at [[Harvard University]]'s Class Day during Commencement ceremonies]]
{{Main|Ali G}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
Baron Cohen appeared during 2-minute sketches as his fashion reporter [[BrÃ¼no (character)|BrÃ¼no]] on [[Paramount Comedy 1|The Paramount Comedy Channel]] during 1998. He shot to fame when his comic character [[Ali G]], an uneducated, boorish [[junglist]], started appearing on the British television show ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' on [[Channel 4]], which first went to air 8 September 1998.

''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' began in 2000, and won the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] for Best Comedy &lt;!--The award is judged on a single episode, and makes no distinction between a program and a full series.--&gt; in the following year. Also in 2000, Baron Cohen as Ali G appeared as the limousine driver in [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2000 video &quot;[[Music (Madonna song)#Music video|Music]]&quot;, directed by [[Jonas Ãkerlund]], who was also responsible for directing the titles for ''Da Ali G Show''.

In 2002, Ali G was the central character in the feature film ''[[Ali G Indahouse]]'', in which he is elected to the British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and foils a plot to bulldoze a community centre in his hometown, [[Staines]]. His television show was exported to the United States in 2003, with new episodes set there, for [[HBO]].

Ali G's interviews with famous people (often politicians) gained notoriety partly because the subjects were not privy to the joke that Ali G, rather than being a real interviewer, was a comic character played by Baron Cohen. According to ''Rolling Stone'' magazine, Baron Cohen would always enter the interview area in character as Ali G, carrying equipment and appearing to be an insignificant crew member. He would arrive with a suited man, whom the interviewee naturally thought was the interviewer. Baron Cohen, as Ali G, would sit down to begin conducting the interview by asking the interviewee some preliminary questions. The interviewee, however, would remain under the impression that the smartly-dressed director would be conducting the interview until short notice prior to cameras rolling: this would grant an advantage of surprise, whereby the interviewee would be less likely to opt out of the Ali interview prior to its commencement.&lt;ref name=manbehindmustache&gt;{{cite news|last =Strauss|first =Neil| coauthors=| title =The man behind the mustache| pages=|work=Rolling Stone |date =14 November 2006|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks| accessdate =14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting willingness of Baron Cohen's targets to answer his frequently risquÃ© questions often created surprising conversations. Interviewees have included:
* astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]]
* politician and consumer advocate [[Ralph Nader]]
* writer [[Gore Vidal]]
* real estate [[Business magnate|mogul]] [[Donald Trump]]
* former [[Surgeon General of the United States|U.S. Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]]
* basketball players [[Dwyane Wade]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Steve Nash]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Richard Jefferson]], [[Tim Duncan]], [[Ben Wallace]] and [[Robert Horry]]
* former US Secretary of State [[James Baker|James Baker III]]
* former [[United States Attorney General|US Attorney General]] [[Dick Thornburgh]]
* businessman and billionaire [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]]
* Professor [[Heinz Wolff]]
* former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|US Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]]
* political commentator [[Pat Buchanan]]
* Professor [[Noam Chomsky]]
* [[Association football|footballer]] [[David Beckham]] and his wife, ex-[[Spice Girl]] [[Victoria Beckham]], for the UK's [[Comic Relief]]
* former [[United Nations Secretary-General|UN Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]] (whom Baron Cohen, in his Ali G character, referred to as 'Boutros Boutros ''Boutros''-Ghali')
* former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]]
* journalist [[Andy Rooney]]
* [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician [[Tony Benn]]
* [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] politician [[Sammy Wilson]]

Baron Cohen is a supporter of ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'' and as Ali G has hosted some interviews for the benefit of the charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P842Tmi6lrc Ali-G Interviews Posh Spice and David Beckham]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Borat===
{{Main|Borat Sagdiyev}}

[[Image:Borat.portrait.png|thumb|right|upright|Baron Cohen as Borat]]

''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'', a feature film with [[Borat Sagdiyev|Borat]] at the centre, was screened at the [[2006 Toronto International Film Festival]] and released in the United Kingdom on 2 November 2006, in the United States on 3 November 2006 and Australia 23 November 2006. The film is about a journey across the United States in an ice cream truck, in which the main character is obsessed with the idea of marrying [[Pamela Anderson]]. The film is a [[mockumentary]] which includes interviews with various American citizens that poke fun at [[American culture]], as well as [[sexism]], [[racism in the United States|racism]], [[homophobia]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]], [[jingoism]] and ''[[Baywatch]]''.

It debuted at the #1 spot in the US, taking in an estimated $26.4&amp;nbsp;million in just 837 theatres averaging $31,600 per theatre, the fourth highest per-theatre average of all time for movies opening wide (500 screens or more), behind ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]''.

Baron Cohen won the 2007 [[Golden Globe]] in the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|&quot;Best Actor â Musical or Comedy&quot;]] category, his sixth such award. Although Borat was up for &quot;Best Motion Picture&amp;nbsp;â Musical or Comedy&quot;, the film lost to ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''. On 23 January 2007, he was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. He shared his nomination with the film's co-writers, [[Ant Hines]], [[Peter Baynham]], Sy Mordecai Finesto, [[Dan Mazer]], and [[Todd Phillips]].

Aside from the comic elements of his characters, Baron Cohen's performances are interpreted by some as reflecting uncomfortable truths about his audience. He juxtaposes his own Jewish lineage with the anti-Semitism of his character Borat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.borat.tv/video/Throw_the_Jew_Down_the_Well.mov Borat: Throw The Jew Down The Well]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Baron Cohen published a travel guide as Borat, with dual titles: ''Borat: Touristic Guidings To Minor Nation of U.S. and A.'' and ''Borat: Touristic Guidings To Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070524/en_nm/books_borat_dc Yahoo.com]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2007, Baron Cohen announced he was retiring the character of Borat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) â 21 Dec 2007 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtYR_WcA82BkzB8Zu5SmiHjLX8CQ |title=AFP: Comedian Cohen says he is killing off Borat |publisher=Google  |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BrÃ¼no===
{{Main|BrÃ¼no (character)}}
Another alter ego Sacha Baron Cohen performed as is '[[BrÃ¼no (character)|BrÃ¼no]]', a flamboyantly gay allegedly-19-year-old Austrian fashion show presenter, who often lures his subjects, unwittingly, into making provocative statements and engaging in embarrassing behaviour, as well as leading them to contradict themselves, often in the same interview. BrÃ¼no asks the subjects to answer 'yes or no' questions with either &quot;Vassup&quot; (whats up), or &quot;Ich don't think so&quot; (No), or sometimes &quot;Ach, ja!&quot; (Ah yes!) or &quot;Nicht, nicht&quot; (&quot;Nicht&quot; means &quot;not&quot; in German). In one segment on ''Da Ali G Show'' he encouraged his guest to answer questions with either &quot;Keep them in the ghetto&quot; or &quot;Train to Auschwitz&quot;. BrÃ¼no's main comedic satire pertains to the vacuity and inanity of the fashion and clubbing world. In May 2009, at the MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as 'BrÃ¼no' wearing a white angel costume, a white jock strap, white go-go boots and white wings, and did an aerial stunt where he dropped from a height (using wires) onto [[Eminem]], Baron Cohen landed on his lap and his rear in Eminem's face, prompting Eminem to exit the venue with fellow rappers of [[D12]]. Eminem later admitted to staging the stunt with Baron Cohen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/31053788 |title=Eminem-Bruno stunt on MTV was planned |publisher=today.msnbc.msn.com/ |date=6 February 2009 |accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Film====
{{Main|BrÃ¼no}}

After an intense bidding war that included such Hollywood powerhouses as [[DreamWorks]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]], and [[20th Century Fox]]; [[Universal Pictures]] paid a reported $42.5&amp;nbsp;million for the rights to the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Forbes | url=http://www.forbes.com/home/digitalentertainment/2006/11/13/borat-cohen-money-tech-media-cz_lg_1114borat.html | title=Borat is Rich...NOT | date= 13 November 2006 | accessdate= 21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[shill]] companies and Web sites were created in order to draw potential interviewees into interviews by creating an illusion of legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0319092bruno1.html | title=Sacha Baron Cohen's Guerilla Tactics | date=19 March 2009 | accessdate=20 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in July 2009.

==Performer versus characters==
Baron Cohen has often been confused with the identity of one of his characters. When he posed as Borat to host the MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon, the central Hungarian news wire agency [[Magyar TÃ¡virati Iroda|MTI]] reported that the host was 'Borat Sagdiyev'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mti.hu/cikk/100185/ |title=MTI reporting from MTV Europe Music Awards |publisher=Mti.hu |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As most Hungarian newspapers and television networks take MTI as their official source, the misinterpretation of the character spread rapidly in Hungary, with some sources (such as [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]]) emphasising that a Kazakh news reporter hosted the awards, while others (such as [[Index.hu]]) noticed and pointed out the error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080206074322/http://index.hu/kultur/media/cc/mtv3446/ Index.hu article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
Baron Cohen has encountered many controversies regarding some of his comic characters:
[[File:Sacha Cohen.jpg|thumb|right|Sacha Baron Cohen at the [[E!]] after party, January 2007.]]
In an interview with former British MP [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] in 2000, Ali G offered Hamilton what was allegedly [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], which Hamilton accepted and smoked, creating some minor controversy in the British media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/607608.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Hamilton 'shared joint' with Ali G | date=18 January 2000 | accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2006 [[MTV Movie Awards]], Borat introduced [[Gnarls Barkley]]'s performance of &quot;Crazy&quot;, where he made a comment about [[Jessica Simpson]], saying that he liked her mouth and that he could [[Cameltoe|see it clearly through her denim pants]]. His appearance was cut from subsequent rebroadcasts.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Baron Cohen has had some trouble because of [[racism|racist]] or [[prejudice]]d comments his characters have made (see ''[[Da Ali G Show#Controversy|Da Ali G Show]]''). HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer has replied to criticism concerning Baron Cohen's characters: 'Through his alter-egos, he delivers an obvious satire that exposes people's ignorance and prejudice in much the same way ''[[All in the Family]]'' did years ago.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=9732 |title=TheJewishWeek.com article |publisher=TheJewishWeek.com article |date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his portrayal as the anti-Semitic Borat, Baron Cohen says the segments are a &quot;dramatic demonstration of how racism feeds on dumb conformity, as much as rabid [[bigotry]]&quot;, rather than a display of racism by Baron Cohen himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/news/va/20060908/115774501000.html |title=&quot;Borat&quot; satire turns to farce at Toronto festival |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Borat essentially works as a tool. By himself being anti-Semitic, he lets people lower their guard and expose their own prejudice&quot;, Baron Cohen explains.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; Addressing the same topic in an [[National Public Radio|NPR]] interview with Robert Siegel, Baron Cohen says &quot;...and I think that's quite an interesting thing with Borat, which is people really let down their guard with him because they're in a room with somebody who seems to have these outrageous opinions. They sometimes feel much more relaxed about letting their own outrageous, politically incorrect, prejudiced opinions come out.&quot;&lt;ref name=npr1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3613548 |title=NPR story |publisher=Npr.org |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen, the grandson of a [[Holocaust]] survivor, says he also wishes in particular to expose the role of indifference in that genocide. &quot;When I was in university, there was this major historian of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], [[Ian Kershaw]], who said, 'The path to [[Auschwitz]] was paved with indifference.' I know it's not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust, but it's an interesting idea that not everyone in Germany had to be a raving anti-Semite. They just had to be [[Apathy|apathetic]].&quot;&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; Regarding the enthusiastic response to his song, [[In My Country There Is Problem|&quot;Throw The Jew Down The Well&quot;]], he says, &quot;Did it reveal that they were anti-Semitic? Perhaps. But maybe it just revealed that they were indifferent to anti-Semitism.&quot;&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt;

Baron Cohen walked onto the runway during the [[Ãgatha Ruiz de la Prada]] fashion show in [[Milan]] on 26 September 2008. In the character of his latest alter-ego BrÃ¼no, he was wearing a costume made out of [[velcro]]. He appeared on the stage with a blanket and items of clothing stuck to his velcro suit. Lights were turned off while security intervened and escorted him off the stage, and the fashion show resumed normally shortly thereafter. Baron Cohen and his team allegedly accessed the fashion show using fake IDs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://omg.yahoo.com/news/sacha-baron-cohen-kicked-out-of-milan-fashion-week/13579 Sacha Baron Cohen Kicked Out of Milan Fashion Week]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an appearance on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'',{{When|date=September 2011}} Baron Cohen stated he was restricted from answering [[David Letterman]]'s question as to how he managed to get an interview with [[Pat Buchanan]] while in character as Ali G due to pending &quot;legal reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on CBS&lt;/ref&gt;

While introducing an award at the [[2009 MTV Movie Awards]], Baron Cohen was lowered upside-down from the rafters dressed as an angel right into rapper [[Eminem]]'s lap after an apparently staged problem with his wire harness. Baron Cohen had only a jockstrap on underneath and fully exposed his buttocks in Eminem's face. Eminem swore repeatedly, demanding that his friends, members of [[D12]], each of whom were sitting next to Eminem, remove Baron Cohen, then left the auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1612970/20090531/story.jhtml BrÃ¼no Lands On [[Eminem]] During Awkward MTV Movie Awards Moment]&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Cohen then announced the winner ([[Zac Efron]]) while still hanging from the wires above the stage. It was later revealed that Eminem and Baron Cohen had planned the gag together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popeater.com/music/article/eminem-bruno-stunt/513457 |title=Eminem Laughs About Bruno Butt in Face |publisher=Popeater.com |date=4 June 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pauly Shore]] claimed, in 2009, that Baron Cohen's film, ''BrÃ¼no'', was &quot;stolen from Shore's '[[Adopted (film)|mockumentary]]'&quot;, as the film ''BrÃ¼no'' had started production after the start of production for ''Adopted'' and also featured the main character adopting a child from a [[Third World]] nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sacha's Up for a Fight |author=Leah Simpson |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/gossip/view/87744/Sacha-s-up-for-a-fight/ |newspaper=[[Daily Star Sunday]] |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future projects==

==Other work==
Baron Cohen [[guest-star]]red in the finale of the fifth season ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', with [[Dustin Hoffman]] as a guide to [[Heaven]]. He also provided the voice of the [[ring-tailed lemur]] king, King Julien, in DreamWorks' family movie ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005) as well as its [[Madagascar 2|2008 sequel]], and appeared as [[Will Ferrell]]'s arch rival the French [[Formula One]] speed demon Jean Girard in the 2006 hit ''[[Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby]]''. He also appeared alongside [[Johnny Depp]] in the 2007 film ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]]'' as Signor Adolfo Pirelli, and co-starred in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 2011 adventure film ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]''.

Baron Cohen tends to avoid doing interviews out of character. However, in 2004, he did the talk show circuit appearing as himself on ''Late Show with David Letterman'', ''[[The Opie and Anthony Show]]'', ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://howardstern.com/rundown.hs?j=n&amp;d=1093158000] The Howard Stern Show&lt;/ref&gt; and others in order to promote the upcoming season of his show on HBO. He was also interviewed on NPR's ''[[All Things Considered]]''.&lt;ref name=npr1/&gt; He also did an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', published in November 2006, that the magazine labelled as &quot;his only interview as himself&quot;.&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; He also appeared in an interview out of character with [[Terry Gross]] on NPR's ''[[Fresh Air]]'' on 4 January 2007.&lt;ref name=npr2&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6723074], [[Fresh Air]], 4 January 2007 (advance to 21:10 in the interview)&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen has twice presented the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]], first as Ali G on 8 November 2001, in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, and then as Borat on 3 November 2005 in [[Lisbon]], Portugal. Baron Cohen appeared out of character to accept an award at the [[British Comedy Awards]] in December 2006. He said at the time that Borat could not make it to the awards as &quot;he's guest of honour at the Holocaust denial conference in Tehran&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6177591.stm |title=Merchant takes top comedy honour |date=14 December 2006 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]].

''Borat'' director [[Larry Charles]] explains that Baron Cohen generally appears in character partly to &quot;protect his weakness&quot;, by focusing public interest on his characters rather than himself.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon |first=Devin |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15560972/site/newsweek/ |title=Newsweek article |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other reason, ''Newsweek'' claims, is that Baron Cohen is fiercely private: &quot;...according to the UK press, his publicists denied not only that he attended a party for the London premiere of ''Borat'', but also that a party even occurred.&quot;&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt;

It was reported online that Baron Cohen might play Freddie Mercury in a biographical film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/features/news/2007/05/070504_queen/ |title=Sacha Baron Cohen to Play Freddie Mercury , Spin Magazine Online |publisher=Spin.com |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his publicist later declared that Baron Cohen would not do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adler |first=Shawn |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1558875/20070504/story.jhtml |title=Sacha Baron Cohen Won't Play Freddie Mercury In Queen Biopic |work=''Mtv'' |date=4 May 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 16 September 2010, representatives for Cohen confirmed that he would indeed be playing the role in an as-of-yet untitled biopic about Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9008440.stm|title=Sacha Baron Cohen to play Freddie Mercury in film|work=[[HARDTalk]]|publisher=BBC News Online  |date=17 September 2010|accessdate=17 September 2010|first=Brian|last=May|authorlink=Brian May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1648051/20100916/mercury_freddie.jhtml |title=Sacha Baron Cohen To Play Freddie Mercury 'Borat' star will portray legendary Queen frontman. |author=Mawuse Ziegbe |date=16 September 2010 |work=''MTV'' |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen shot a spread with [[supermodel]] [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] for ''[[Marie Claire]]'' magazine to promote the film ''BrÃ¼no''.&lt;ref name=elite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elitemodels.com/details.aspx?navbtn=1&amp;city=NY&amp;modelid=245266&amp;pic=472.jpg&amp;subid=4670&amp;mainsubid=4670&amp;io=&amp;indx=1/ |title=Marie Claire Spread |publisher=Elitemodels.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sports Illustrated]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s 6 November 2006 issue contains a column called &quot;Skater vs. Instigator&quot;, which illustrates various amusing &quot;parallels&quot; between Baron Cohen and figure skater [[Sasha Cohen]], ranging from their mutually held personal significance of the number 4,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubicao.tk/theory/4supreme.html 4 is the Supreme Number of the Universe â CubicAO]&lt;/ref&gt; to their mutual romantic interests in redheads.

Baron Cohen was featured on Australian talk show ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove]]'' as BrÃ¼no on 28 June 2009.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Baron Cohen was featured in the [[Time 100]] list for 2007.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |last = Barr

In 2010, Cohen guest-starred on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in the episode &quot;[[The Greatest Story Ever D'ohed]]&quot; as Jakob, an angry Israeli tour guide.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and family===
Baron Cohen married Australian actress [[Isla Fisher]] on 15 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://showbiz.sky.com/weddings-and-engagements-2010 |title=Isla Fisher and Sasha Baron Cohen Wed |publisher=Showbiz.sky.com |date= |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three years of study, Fisher [[Conversion to Judaism|converted]] to Judaism in early 2007, saying &quot;I will definitely have a Jewish wedding just to be with Sacha. I would do anything â move into any religion â to be united in marriage with him.

===Legal issues===
Two residents of [[Moroeni|Glod]], the [[Romania]]n village in which the opening scenes of ''Borat'' were filmed, hired attorney [[Edward Fagan]] to sue the makers of ''Borat'' for $30&amp;nbsp;million. They alleged that the intent of the film was misrepresented to them, that the poorest members of their village were made to look like &quot;savages&quot;, and that they were underpaid, particularly when their minute salaries were compared to the millions earned by the completed movie. During several segments, children were filmed with guns and other weapons and in another scene, an amputee who lost his arm was told to wear a rubber fist sex toy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=415871&amp;in_page_id=1770 &quot;Borat film 'tricked' poor village actors&quot;], Daily Mail, 11 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed in New York hearing on the grounds that the allegations were too vague to stand up in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/12/05/arts/NA_A-E_MOV_US_Borat_Backlash.php &quot;New York judge questions viability of villagers' 'Borat' lawsuit&quot;] IHT, 5 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Kazakhstan]] threatened Baron Cohen with legal action following the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards ceremony in [[Lisbon]], and the authority in charge of the country's country-code top-level domain name removed the website that he had created for his character Borat (previously: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.borat.kz)&lt;/nowiki&gt; for alleged violation of the lawâspecifically, registering for the domain under a false name. ''[[The New York Times]]'', (among others), has reported that Baron Cohen, (in character as Borat), replied: &quot;I'd like to state that I have no connection with Mr Cohen and fully support my government decision to sue this Jew&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/11/25/borat-lawsuit-051125.html &quot;British comic responds to legal threat against 'Borat{{'&quot;}}], CBC, 25 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, defended by [[Dariga Nazarbayeva]], a politician and the daughter of Kazakhstan President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], who stated, &quot;We should not be afraid of humour and we shouldn't try to control everything, I think.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/04/21/borat-kazakhstan-defence.html?ref=rss &quot;Daughter of Kazakhstan's president defends Borat&quot;], CBC, 21 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The deputy foreign minister of Kazakhstan later invited Baron Cohen to visit the country, stating that he could learn that &quot;women drive cars, wine is made of grapes, and Jews are free to go to synagogues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6066040.stm &quot;Kazakh invite for Borat creator&quot;], BBC News, 19 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After the worldwide success of the ''Borat'' film, the Kazakh government, including the president, altered their stance on Baron Cohen's parody, tacitly recognising the invaluable press the controversy created for their country.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Robert A. (Spring 2008), &quot;Buying into Brand Borat: Kazakhstanâs Cautious Embrace of Its Unwanted 'Son{{'&quot;}}, ''Slavic Review'', '''67'''(1): 63â80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen encountered another problem around his Borat character. Two of the three [[University of South Carolina]] students who appear in ''Borat'' sued the filmmakers, alleging that they were duped into signing release forms while drunk, and that false promises were made that the footage was for a documentary that would never be screened in the US. On 11 December 2006, a Los Angeles judge denied the pair a restraining order to remove them from the film. The lawsuit was dismissed in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defamer.com/hollywood/celeb-jurisprudence/borat-frat-boys-lawsuit-dismissed-by-judge-who-secretly-knows-sacha-baron-cohens-golden-globes-speech-by-heart-237454.php |title=Borat Frat Boys Lawsuit Dismissed By Judge Who Secretly Knows Sacha Baron Cohen's Golden Globes Speech By Heart |publisher=Defamer.com |date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 May 2009, a charity worker at a seniors bingo game sued Baron Cohen, claiming an incident shot for ''BrÃ¼no'' at a charity bingo tournament left her disabled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsbizarre.com/2009/06/richelle-olson-bruno-austrian.html &quot;Richelle Olson : Bruno the Austrian Fashionista Sued&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the worker later retracted her statement, saying the &quot;actor never struck her&quot;, but that he &quot;beat her down emotionally to the point she's now confined to a wheelchair&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2009/07/10/sacha-baron-cohen-bingo-re-sued/ TMZ News (11 July 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; The scene did not make the final cut for the film.

A [[BrÃ¼no#Ayman_Abu_Aita_lawsuit_.26_Al_Aqsa_Martyrs_Brigades|lawsuit was filed]] on 30 April 2010 in the [[District of Columbia]] by [[Palestinian Christian]] Ayman Abu Aita of [[Beit Sahour]], [[Bethlehem]], [[West Bank]], against Baron Cohen relating to his interview which was used in ''BrÃ¼no''. Aita alleges that he has been [[defamed]] by false accusations that he is a terrorist. Aita included David Letterman in the suit based on comments made during the 7 July 2009 appearance by Baron Cohen on the ''Late Show with David Letterman''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdsupra.com/post/documentViewer.aspx?fid=6f3b0cc6-fb7a-4b9d-990b-984020fbefc8 Complaint filed in the District of Columbia, Case # 2010CA002966], retrieved on 30 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;   On 4 November 2010, the DC Case was dismissed with Aita given 120 days to file in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or have the case permanently dismissed (see [https://www.dccourts.gov/pa/pages/CRTVCaseSummary.jsp?case_id=4691231%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;xsl= DC Case Docket Sheet]).

===Israel and Judaism===
Baron Cohen first acted in theatrical productions featuring the Socialist-Zionist youth movement [[Habonim Dror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1883923,00.html

He spent a year in Israel at [[Kibbutz]] [[Rosh HaNikra (kibbutz)|Rosh HaNikra]] and Kibbutz [[Beit HaEmek]] as part of the Shnat Habonim Dror, as well as taking part in the programme [[Machon L'Madrichei Chutz La'Aretz]] for Jewish youth movement leaders.

According to Baron Cohen, &quot;I wouldn't say that I am a religious Jew, but I'm still proud to be Jewish&quot;. However, he keeps [[kosher]] and attends synagogue about twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article1294842.ece ]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen frequently speaks in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] while playing the anti-Semitic character Borat. He also sang the lyrics from an old [[kibbutz]] song (pretending that it was the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] national anthem) in an episode of ''Da Ali G Show''. In one of the deleted scenes of his movie, after being asked by the host-pastor to lead the table in a pre-meal prayer service, Baron Cohen, in his character role of Borat, sings a lengthy hymn (not Hebrew) that has clear similarities to the [[Mussaf]] prayer service of the Jewish [[High Holidays]]. He actually repeatedly sings two Polish phrases (slightly mispronounced) &quot;Excuse me ma'am do you speak English?&quot; and &quot;Could you speak slowly please?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTaFkahld50 |title=Borat dinner prayer scene |publisher=YouTube |date=24 November 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
