&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Main Road Network of Alberta&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
All of Alberta's provincial highways are maintained by [[Alberta Transportation]] (AT), a department of the [[Government of Alberta]], and all of them have been designated by AT as 'Primary Highways' since 2000/2001. The Primary Highways are divided into two series, the &quot;1-216 Series&quot; makes up Alberta's core highway network, has the highest traffic volume, and are mostly paved. The &quot;500-986 Series&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Secondary Highways&quot;, provide more local access, and include a large number of gravel highways.

== Primary Highways, 1-216 Series ==
[[File:AB-provincial highway.svg|32px|left]]
Albertaâs 1 to 216 Series of Primary Highways are Albertaâs main highways. Prior to 2000/2001, this highway series was designated simply as Albertaâs &quot;Primary Highways&quot; network.  However, it was redesignated by Alberta Transportation as the &quot;Primary Highways, 1 to 216 Series&quot; when Albertaâs former &quot;Secondary Highways&quot; network was redesignated as Albertaâs &quot;Primary Highways, 500 to 986 Series&quot; network in 2000/2001.  The redesignation of both highway networks was triggered when jurisdiction over the former &quot;Secondary Highways&quot; network was transferred from municipalities to the Province.  Despite the redesignation, the 1 to 216 Series and the 500 to 986 Series of Primary Highways are still commonly referred to as &quot;Primary Highways&quot; and &quot;Secondary Highways&quot; respectively by the public, municipalities, politicians, the media and even other provincial ministries.

The 1 to 216 Series of Primary Highways are numbered from 1 to 100, with the exception of the [[ring road]]s around Calgary and Edmonton, which are numbered 201 and 216, denoting their bypass linkages between highways 2 &amp; 1 and 2 &amp; 16 respectively.

All or portions of Highways 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 16, 28, 28A, 35, 43, 49, and 63 are considered Core Routes of Canadaâs National Highway System (NHS).&lt;ref name=NHS&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/media/documents/policy/NHS_2007.pdf | title=National Highway System | publisher=Transport Canada | accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highway 28 from Highway 63 to Cold Lake is considered a NHS feed route and Highway 58 between Rainbow Lake and Highway 88 is considered a NHS Northern/Remote Route.&lt;ref name=NHS/&gt;

Highways 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, and 43 are considered Albertaâs most important interprovincial and international highways and are [[divided highway]]s ([[Limited-access road|expressway]]s) or [[freeway]]s for much or all of their length. Speed limits are generally {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} except on some divided highways and freeways which are {{convert|110|km/h|mph}} or on Highways 1 and 16 through the Banff and Jasper National Parks which can be {{convert|90|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

The Highway 15/28A/28/63 corridor between Edmonton and Fort McMurray is considered one of Albertaâs most important intraprovincial highways.  A twinning program is currently underway between Boyle and Fort McMurray.  Highway 63 from Fort McMurray north to the Suncor and Syncrude oil sands operations is also twinned.

Although only Highways 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 16, 43, 63, 100, 201, and 216 are twinned (expressways) for most of their length, the vast majority of Albertaâs Primary Highway Series are two-lanes paved, while segments of Highways 40, 58, 68, and 88 remain as gravel.

Alberta's 500 to 986 Series of Primary Highways are generally considered local or rural highways.  Prior to 2000/2001, this highway series was under municipal jurisdiction and was previously known as Albertaâs âSecondary Highwayâ network.  Over a short period of time in 2000 and 2001, responsibility and funding of this highway network was transferred to the Province, particularly Alberta Transportation.  Concurrent with the transfer, the designation of the âSecondary Highwaysâ network was changed to the âPrimary Highways, 500 to 986 Seriesâ network to reflect that they were now under provincial jurisdiction. As a result, the Provinceâs âPrimary Highwaysâ network was also redesignated as the âPrimary Highways, 1 to 216 Seriesâ network.  Despite the change in jurisdiction and the redesignation, this series of highways is still commonly referred to as âSecondary Highwaysâ by the public, municipalities, politicians, the media and even other provincial ministries.

The 500 to 986 Series of Primary Highways is divided into three sub-series:

*The 500/600 Highways are west-east roads where the numbering increases northward from the [[List of Montana numbered highways|Montana]] border to the [[List of Northwest Territories highways|Northwest Territories]] border.
*The 700/800 Highways are south-north roads where numbering increases eastward from the [[List of British Columbia provincial highways|British Columbia]] border to the [[List of Saskatchewan provincial highways|Saskatchewan]] border.
*The 900 Highways are newer or planned roads that have been established for future consideration as, or as potential extensions or re-alignments of, the 1-216 Highway Series.

Some of these highways are paved, while others are entirely or partially gravel. Rural speed limits range from {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} to {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.

=== 900 and X series ===
The roads in the 900 and X series are typically highways that are planned realignments, potential realignments currently under consideration, or extensions of existing highways. The numbers applied to each highway in the 900 and X series are derived from the highway that is planned to be realigned or extended (i.e. [[Alberta Highway 901|Hwy 901]] is a potential reaignment of Hwy 1, Hwy 16X will be a realignment of Hwy 16, and [[Alberta Highway 986|Hwy 986]] is an extension of Hwy 686). [[Alberta Highway 1X|Highway 1X]] between Cochrane and Canmore, which is a short spur route connecting Highway 1 and Highway 1A, is an exception to the typical roles of the 900 and X series highways, as well as [[Alberta Highway 10X|Highway 10X]], which is also a spur.
