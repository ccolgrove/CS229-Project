'''''The IT Crowd''''' is a [[British sitcom]] by [[Channel 4]], written by [[Graham Linehan]], produced by [[Ash Atalla]] and starring [[Chris O'Dowd]], [[Richard Ayoade]], [[Katherine Parkinson]] and [[Matt Berry]]. The &quot;IT&quot; in the show's title can be pronounced as either the word ''it'' {{IPA-en|ËÉªt|}}, as in &quot;the 'it' crowd&quot;, or as the letters IT {{IPA-en|ËaÉªËtiË|}}, as in the abbreviation for [[information technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SeriesOneDVDCommentary&quot; /&gt;

Set in the London offices of the fictional Reynholm Industries, the show revolves around the three staff members of its IT department: a genius named Maurice Moss (Ayoade), the workshy Roy Trenneman (O'Dowd), and Jen Barber (Parkinson), the department head/&quot;Relationship Manager,&quot; who knows nothing about IT. The show also focuses on the bosses of Reynholm Industries: Denholm Reynholm ([[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]]) and his son Douglas (Berry).

The comedy premiered on Channel 4 on 3 February 2006, and has run for four [[TV series|series]] of 6 episodes each. Although a fifth series has been commissioned,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian26May2010FifthSeries&quot; /&gt; Graham Linehan announced on 20 October 2011 that there won't be a fifth series, only an extended special in 2012.&lt;ref name=2012special /&gt;

The show was the third successful sitcom creation of Graham Linehan, following ''[[Father Ted]]'' (co-written with [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]]) and ''[[Black Books]]'' (co-written with [[Dylan Moran]]).

==Plot==
''The IT Crowd'' is set in the offices of Reynholm Industries, a fictional British corporation in central London. It focuses on the shenanigans of the three-strong IT support team located in a dingy, untidy, and unkempt basement â a great contrast to the shining modern architecture and stunning London views enjoyed by the rest of the organisation. The obscurity surrounding what the company does serves as a [[running gag]] throughout the series â all that is known is that the company bought and sold [[ITV]] (a fact which Denholm Reynholm forgot completely), and once made part-year profits of &quot;eighteen hundred billion billion&quot;. Douglas Reynholm claims his father Denholm Reynholm described the IT department as being run by &quot;a dynamic go-getter (Jen), a [[genius]] (Moss) and a man from Ireland (Roy)&quot;.

Moss and Roy, the two technicians, are portrayed as socially inept [[geek]]s or, in Denholm Reynholm's words, &quot;standard nerds&quot;. Despite the company's dependence on their services, they are despised, ignored, and considered losers by the rest of the staff. Roy's exasperation is reflected in his support techniques of ignoring the phone in the hope it will stop ringing, and using [[reel-to-reel tape recordings]] of stock IT suggestions (&quot;[[Power cycling|Have you tried turning it off and on again?]]&quot; and &quot;Is it definitely plugged in?&quot;). He expresses his &quot;personality&quot; by wearing a different geek T-shirt in each episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODowdInterview9May2009&quot; /&gt; Moss' wide and intricate knowledge of all things technical is reflected in his extremely accurate yet utterly indecipherable suggestions, while he demonstrates a complete inability to deal with practical problems like extinguishing fires and removing spiders.

Jen, the newest member of the team, is hopelessly non-technical, despite claiming on her [[curriculum vitae|CV]] that she has &quot;a lot of experience with computers&quot;. As Denholm, the company boss, is equally tech-illiterate, he is convinced by Jen's interview bluffing and appoints her head of the IT department. Her official title is &quot;relationship manager&quot;, yet her attempts at bridging the gulf between the technicians and the business generally have the opposite effect, landing Jen in situations just as ludicrous as those of her teammates.

==Cast and characters==
[[File:The IT Crowd.jpg|thumb|Jen, Moss, and Roy.]]

{{Main|List of The IT Crowd characters}}

* [[Chris O'Dowd]] as [[List of The IT Crowd characters#Roy Trenneman|Roy Trenneman]] â a laid-back IT technician from Ireland, Roy is often shown to go to great lengths to fob off workmates so he can sit around doing nothing. However, when something does happen, he is always the one who gets the wrong end of the stick and is constantly either injured or in distress. He and his co-worker Moss are described as ''&quot;standard nerds&quot;'' by Denholm Reynholm.&lt;ref group=&quot;ep&quot; name=&quot;Yesterday's Jam&quot; /&gt;
* [[Richard Ayoade]] as [[Maurice Moss]] â highly intelligent with a lack of social skills, Moss is a ''&quot;standard nerd&quot;'' who struggles to communicate with anything that does not have a keyboard. Moss lives at home with his mother, who also dresses him and packs him lunch.
* [[Katherine Parkinson]] as [[List of The IT Crowd characters#Jen Barber|Jen Barber]] â after claiming she has had &quot;a lot of experience with computers&quot; Jen is made head of Reynholm Industries IT department, where she is soon proven by Roy and Moss to in fact have no knowledge of IT at all. However, she finds her niche by working as the ''Relationship Manager'' between IT and the rest of Reynholm Industries.
* [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] as [[List of The IT Crowd characters#Denholm Reynholm|Denholm Reynholm]] (series 1 &amp; 2 recurring, series 3 'From Hell') â the founder of Reynholm industries, Denholm has very little understanding of IT. In series 2 Denholm is informed by the police of a problem with the company's pension accounts, leading him to commit suicide by walking out a high storey window. He appears once in series 3 when Douglas sees him briefly in the afterlife.
* [[Matt Berry]] as [[List of The IT Crowd characters#Douglas Reynholm|Douglas Reynholm]] (series 2 recurring, 3 &amp; 4 main cast) â the son of Denholm ''&quot;that fled from a hefty lawsuit to go off womanising all over the world&quot;'' using his father's cash, Douglas inherits Reynholm Industries. At the end of series 4, he is taken to court by his apparently 'dead' wife, Victoria. There is quite an argument, but in the end she sues him for a large amount of money.
* [[Noel Fielding]] as [[List of The IT Crowd characters#Richmond Avenal|Richmond Avenal]] (series 1 &amp; 2 recurring, series 4 one episode) â once a young go-getter at Reynholm Industries, Richmond was the right-hand-man to Denholm, before finding [[Cradle of Filth]] and becoming a [[Goth subculture|goth]] - leading to his downfall as a successful businessman. As a result he ends up confined to the [[server room]] in the basement, next to the IT department. Richmond did not appear in Series 3 due to Noel Fielding's busy schedule. Richmond was said by Moss to have [[scurvy]]. In the fourth series' final episode, Richmond features once more in a guest appearance, where it is revealed that after he caught scurvy he decided that he didn't want to be a goth after all, and instead began running a successful business called &quot;Goth2Boss&quot; to encourage goths to cheer up and make good use of their lives.&lt;ref group=&quot;ep&quot; name=&quot;Reynholm vs Reynholm&quot; /&gt;

==Cultural references==
{{original research|section|date=January 2011}}

[[Image:The IT Crowd DVD.jpg|thumb|One of the Series 1 DVD menus in the style of [[isometric adventure game]]s such as ''[[Knight Lore]]'' and ''[[Head Over Heels (video game)|Head Over Heels]]'']]

The show tries to add a large number of references to [[geek culture]] and professionalism, mostly in set dressing and props. Dialogue (both technical and cultural) is usually authentic and any [[technobabble]] used often contains [[in-jokes]] for viewers knowledgeable in such subjects. Roy regularly wears shirts that feature [[Leet speak]], such as the acronyms [[wikt:OMG|OMFG]] and [[RTFM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymgeek.com |title=Largest Internet Database of Acronyms |publisher=Acronym Geek |date= |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series 3 Episode 1 has Roy wearing the Music Elitism Venn Diagram tee and I Screw Robots sticker from the webcomic [[Diesel Sweeties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dieselsweeties.com |title=robot webcomic and geeky music t-shirts |publisher=diesel sweeties |date= |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, there will be movie-style scenes that parody fight scenes and melodrama.

In August 2008, having not had time to source the props himself, Linehan appealed to fans to donate items to use for series 3, to make the set look like &quot;a geek's [[Shangri-La]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC13Aug2008Props&quot; /&gt; The [[Centre for Computing History]] loaned a collection of computers from the 1970s and 1980s. They included an [[Altair 8800]], [[Tangerine Computer Systems#Oric Atmos|Oric Atmos]], [[Amstrad CPC 464]], [[ZX81|Sinclair ZX81]], [[ZX Spectrum#ZX Spectrum +2|Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Commodore PET]], [[Atari ST]], [[Sord M5]], [[Risc PC|Acorn RISC PC600]], [[BBC Model B]], an [[Astro Wars]] game, circuit boards from a [[Wang VS]] mainframe and several shelves of old computer manuals. One manual with the letters MOSS on the spine sits on the shelf behind Moss.

Many items on the set reflect Linehan's own personal taste. There are numerous examples of this, but most noticeable are the [[V for Vendetta]] (Guy Fawkes) mask, the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]], various [[xkcd]] references, such as the &quot;Map of Online Communities&quot; Poster and the &quot;Actual Size!&quot; sticker on Moss' computer, the [[Robert Pollard]] and [[Guided by Voices]] posters (Guided by Voices is one of Linehan's favourite bands, cropping up in background music, on t-shirts and getting a specific mention in series 3, episode 3), and the [[War on Terror (game)|War on Terror board game]], which is played by Moss and Roy in series 2, episode 4. The main stickers found around the office include [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (&quot;Fair Use has a POSSE&quot;, &quot;MP3 is not a crime&quot;, &quot;Coding is not a crime&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/campaigns/stickers/ |title=EFF: Stickers |publisher=W2.eff.org |date= |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Open Rights Group]]. On the fourth season some [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] stickers were added, including one on Moss's LCD, Jen's office door, and the department's door.

==Production==
Linehan wrote the first four series alone, but later said he intended to use a team of writers for a fifth series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian26May2010FifthSeries&quot; /&gt;

The show is filmed before a live studio audience, which at the time was considered by some as risky, with the format thought to have been surpassed by more fly-on-the-wall type presentations.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC9Feb2006Figures&quot; /&gt; This was a deliberate choice by Linehan, who sought to challenge the current vogue for hailing the &quot;death of the sitcom&quot;, stating &quot;I trust my instincts, so I'm going to do it my way and hope people come to me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC9Feb2006Figures&quot; /&gt; The first series was recorded in front of a live audience at [[Teddington Studios]] but moved to [[Pinewood Studios]] for series 2 onwards, with some additional location footage.

The title sequence of the show was produced by [[Shynola]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shynola.com/ |title=Shynola website obligation |publisher=Shynola.com |date= |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the soundtrack closely resembling the [[Tubeway Army]] hit ''[[Are 'Friends' Electric?]]''.

==Episodes==
{{Main|List of The IT Crowd episodes}}

All four series have run for 6 episodes each. The first series premiered on 3 February 2006, the second on 24 August 2007, the third on 21 November 2008 and the fourth on 25 June 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Season4StartJune25&quot; /&gt;

In a first for Channel 4, each episode of the first series was available for download from the station's web site for the seven days preceding its initial television broadcast. Downloads were only available for UK and Ireland viewers and were supplied in [[Windows Media Video]] format. All but the first two episodes were encoded with [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] restrictions.

The opening episode of series 4 was released by Channel 4's online service [[4oD]] a week before the television broadcast, though in order to protect the programme this was only available to registered and logged-in viewers, whereas much of 4oD's post-broadcast output is freely available.

A fifth series has been commissioned for 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;S5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/news/story/00000310/the_it_crowd_series_5/|title=The IT Crowd awarded a 5th series - News - British Comedy Guide|work=Comedy.co.uk|date=26 May 2010|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 Graham Linehan was quoted as saying that he intended the fifth series to be the last as he wanted &quot;one more series to really say goodbye to the characters and the fans&quot; and did not want it to become &quot;a zombie series where the show is dead but its body is still moving around.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chortle.co.uk/news/2011/05/20/13329/thats_the_end_of_it|title=That's the end of IT|work=chortle.co.uk|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, Graham Linehan stated that there will not be a fifth series - just a one off special in 2012.&lt;ref name=2012special&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/lix9h/iama_man_named_graham_linehan_creator_of_the_it/|title=Graham Linehan AMA on Reddit|word=reddit.com|date=20 Oct 2011|accessdate=20 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Series 1
The first series was released in the UK as &quot;The IT Crowd - Version 1.0&quot; on 13 November 2006 by 2 Entertain Video Ltd. The DVD start-up sequence and subsequent menus are designed to resemble a [[ZX Spectrum]]. The DVD also included a [[short film]] written and directed by Linehan called ''[[Hello Friend]]'', his directorial debut, and a tongue in cheek behind-the-scenes documentary presented by Ken Korda, a film maker created and portrayed by Comedian [[Adam Buxton]] (of [[Adam and Joe]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The IT Crowd Series 2 DVD Easter Eggs | url = http://narfation.org/2008/03/14/the-it-crowd-season-2-dvd-easter-eggs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVD2EasterEgg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/what-if-we-ran-a-competition-and-no-one-came/ |title=Blog entry by Graham Linehan about Easter Eggs |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An American region ([[NTSC]]) release of the DVD was delayed due to a delay in the broadcast of the American adaptation. [[MPI Home Video]] released it on 31 March 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmazonSeries1DVDRegion1MPI&quot; /&gt; The American version does not contain the audio commentaries which are found on the British version.

;Series 2
&quot;The IT Crowd - Version 2.0&quot; DVD was released in the UK on 1 October 2007, together with a [[box set]] containing both the first and second series. Retail chain HMV sold an exclusive limited edition version featuring a set of four postcards in the style of popular viral photos such as [[lolcats|Ceiling Cat]] â here replicated as ''Ceiling Goth''. Whereas the first series DVD menus parodied 8-bit games, the Series 2 DVD menus parody 16-bit games and make reference to Zero Wing ([[All your base are belong to us|all your base meme]]), Mortal Kombat, Tetris and Lemmings. There are also several 'hidden' extras encoded into the subtitles. These are done in much the same way as the base64 subtitles from Series 1, and include three JPG images and a [[Z-machine|text adventure game file]]. Episode 4 has a BBC BASIC listing, and Episode 6 has light bars in the corner of the screen which can be decoded using a light reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The IT Crowd Series 2 DVD Easter Eggs | url = http://narfation.org/2008/03/14/the-it-crowd-season-2-dvd-easter-eggs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVD2EasterEgg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/what-if-we-ran-a-competition-and-no-one-came/ |title=Blog entry by Graham Linehan about Easter Eggs |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A box-set containing series 1-3 was released in the UK on 16 March 2009 under the 2|entertain label. A single DVD featuring all six episodes was also released on 16 March 2009. As with both the series 1 and 2 DVDs, the menus are based on different games. In particular, such internet games as GROW CUBE, Doeo and flow.

The American region DVD was released on 15 September 2009.

;Series 4
The DVD for series 4 was released in the UK on 27 September 2010, also under the 2|entertain label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The IT Crowd Series 4 UK DVD information | url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/Crowd-Version-4-0-DVD/dp/B003TEFQTE/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A box-set containing all four series was also released on the same day, which includes an IT Crowd-themed board game.

The American region DVD was released on 14 December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The IT Crowd Series 4 USA DVD information | url = http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Crowd-Season-4/14445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
===American version===
A USA version of ''The IT Crowd'' was almost aired by [[NBC]]. It starred [[Richard Ayoade]] reprising his role as Moss, with [[Joel McHale]] as Roy, [[Jessica St. Clair]] as Jen and [[Rocky Carroll]] as Denholm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/Fall_Preview/The_IT_Crowd/cast_credits.shtml|title=The IT Crowd - Cast/Credits|publisher=NBC|accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was produced by [[FremantleMedia]] for [[Universal Media Studios]] with Linehan and Steve Tao as Executive Producers. There were four writers involved - David Guarascio, Moses Port, Joe Port and Joe Wiseman. A pilot was filmed in January 2007, and a full series was ordered, advertised by NBC to be aired in 2007â08.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC22Jan2007USPilot&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BCC17Jan2007Ayoade&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NBCFallPreviewITCrowd&quot; /&gt; According to a report in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' in September 2007, the show had not gone into production and was to be cancelled, despite the fact that a number of scripts had already been written, stating the series &quot;didn't quite spark&quot; with new NBC chairman [[Ben Silverman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HollywoodReporter13Sep2007ITOut&quot; /&gt;

On 30 July 2010, Linehan confirmed that a US version of the show is back on, with possible changes due to negative reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardianinterview&quot; /&gt;

===German version===
A German version of the programme was in production starting June 2007, starring [[Sky du Mont]], Sebastian MÃ¼nster, Stefan Puntigam and Britta Horn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = German version | url = http://www.serienjunkies.de/news/ortstermin-setbesuch-16234.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally titled ''Das iTeam - Die Jungs mit der Maus'' (''The iTeam - The Boys with the Mouse''), the title was changed to ''Das iTeam - Die Jungs an der Maus'' (''The iTeam - The Boys at the Mouse'') at the last minute. The premiere episode was aired on 4 January 2008 on [[Sat.1]]. After the first episode was broadcast online, the adaptation received a mainly negative response from Internet forum users and blog writers. It was criticised for the quality of its translation and direction, and the poor performance of Stefan Puntigam as Gabriel (German version's name for Moss). The show was dropped by Sat.1 in January 2008 after the second episode due to low ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.quotenmeter.de/index.php?newsid=24747 | title = Quotenmeter.de - Schluss mit lustig: Sat.1 wirft Â«Das iTeamÂ» raus | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Ratings===
The premiere of the show on Channel 4 was watched by 1.8m viewers, described as &quot;disappointing&quot; by [[BBC News]]; however, Linehan stated he was &quot;playing the long game&quot; and reflected how the first series of ''Father Ted'' also &quot;went pretty unnoticed&quot; but went on to gain viewers and awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC9Feb2006Figures&quot; /&gt; The series 4 finale on 30 July 2010 saw the show reach its current ratings peak of 2.17 million and was highly successful in its time slot.

The show has won awards from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTAs), the [[International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] (the International Emmys), the [[Rose d'Or]] television entertainment awards, and also from the fan voted Comedy.co.uk Awards organised by the [[British Comedy Guide]].
