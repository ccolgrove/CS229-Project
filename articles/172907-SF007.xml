'''Monkey's Audio''' is a [[file format]] for [[audio data compression]]. Being a [[lossless data compression|lossless]] format, Monkey's Audio does not discard data during the process of encoding, unlike [[lossy compression]] methods such as [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[MP3]], [[Vorbis]] and [[Musepack]].

Data file compression is employed in order to reduce bandwidth, file transfer time, and/or storage requirements. A digital recording (such as a [[CD]]) encoded to the Monkey's Audio format can be decompressed into an identical copy of the original audio data. As with the [[FLAC]] and [[Apple Lossless]] format, files encoded to Monkey's Audio are typically reduced to about half of the original size,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monkeysaudio.com/comparison.html Monkey's Audio official comparison]&lt;/ref&gt; with data transfer rates and bandwidth requirements being reduced accordingly.

Monkey's Audio's advantages are slightly better compression rates compared to [[FLAC]] and [[WavPack]],&lt;ref&gt;http://flake-enc.sourceforge.net/benchmarks.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://web.inter.nl.net/users/hvdh/lossless/All.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://members.home.nl/w.speek/comparison.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]]/multicore support.&lt;ref name=ver&gt;http://www.monkeysaudio.com/versionhistory.html&lt;/ref&gt; Monkey's Audio main drawbacks are the fact that it employs a symmetric algorithm, meaning the decoding takes comparable resources to encoding, which makes it unsuitable for all but the fastest portable players (via [[Rockbox]] firmware),&lt;ref name=rockbox&gt;http://www.rockbox.org/wiki/SoundCodecMonkeysAudio&lt;/ref&gt; and that it has limited support on software platforms other than Windows; on other platforms only decoding is officially supported by third-party programs. Although the original [[source code]] is freely available, the license is not considered to be an [[open source]] one.&lt;ref name='gentoo'/&gt;&lt;ref name=ubuntu/&gt; A [[GPL]] version of the decoder has been independently written for rockbox and then included in [[ffmpeg]].&lt;ref name=ubuntu/&gt;&lt;ref name=ffmpeg&gt;http://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-0.5.changelog&lt;/ref&gt;

Monkey's Audio files use the [[filename extension]] &lt;tt&gt;.ape&lt;/tt&gt; for audio, and &lt;tt&gt;.apl&lt;/tt&gt; for track metadata.

==Comparisons==
Like any lossless compression scheme, Monkey's Audio format takes up several times as much space as lossy compression formats like [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[MP3]] and [[Vorbis]]. A Monkey's Audio file is 3â5 times as large as a 192 kbit/s bitrate MP3.

The latest version of Monkey's Audio, Version 4.10, was released on 2011-04-16.  The [[Shorten]] format, popular with live taping enthusiasts for years, is no longer in development, but is still in use on some sites such as [[etree]]. FLAC has an active development community that continues to refine the format. Because Monkey's Audio is relatively slow when encoding or decoding files (what FLAC accomplishes in several seconds can take a minute or more with Monkey's Audio) FLAC has largely eclipsed it as the preferred format for commercial distribution of lossless audio.

Although Monkey's Audio is distributed as [[freeware]], the source code includes license terms that prevent most [[Linux distribution]]s and other [[free software]] projects from including it.&lt;ref name='gentoo'&gt;[http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=94477#c48 Gentoo Bug 94477 - new ebuild: media-sound/mac (Linux ported version of Monkey's Audio converter)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, FLAC has only [[open source license]]s, so it comes pre-installed with most Linux distributions, is preferred by Linux users, and enjoys broad support in applications.

==Supported platforms==
Officially, Monkey's Audio is available only for the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform, though discussion on the Monkey's Audio website has hinted at future support for [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS]]. A developer using the moniker SuperMMX released an unofficial port in early 2005, which also includes plugins to allow playback using [[Beep Media Player]] and the [[XMMS]] audio player. This port was originally developed for Linux but, since version 3.99 update 4 build 4, it has included support for [[Mac OS X]] as well as Linux on the [[PowerPC]] and [[SPARC]] architectures. The port has not been updated since late 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cn icon}} http://supermmx.org/linux/mac&lt;/ref&gt; but there are updates maintained by the community.&lt;ref&gt;http://etree.org/shnutils/shntool/&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-platform [[ffmpeg]] supports decoding Monkey's Audio files since version 0.5.&lt;ref name=ffmpeg/&gt;  A [[GStreamer]] plug-in is also available, but only for the older 0.8.x version.&lt;ref&gt;http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/gst-monkeysaudio/0.8.2.html&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[OS X]] players and rippers support the format as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pure-mac.com/audio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While the license text claims to permit using the official Monkey's Audio codec in GPL projects, several [[Linux distribution]] maintainers have found the license to be contradictory. It does not permit redistribution or modification, and thus is not considered [[open source]] or [[free software]].&lt;ref name='gentoo'/&gt;&lt;ref name=ubuntu&gt;{{Cite web|author=Michael Sebastian |date=25 June 2007 |title=Ubuntu bug entry about Monkey's audio inclusion |url=https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/119412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monkey's Audio files can be encoded and decoded on any platform which has a [[Java Platform, Standard Edition|J2SE]] implementation, by the means of the unofficial [http://jmac.sourceforge.net/ JMAC library], which is [[Free software]] licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License|GNU LGPL]].

On hardware platforms, the open source jukebox firmware project [[Rockbox]] supports playback of Monkey's Audio-encoded files on most of its supported targets, but many lack sufficient processing power to play the files back in real time on any but the lowest compression settings.&lt;ref name=rockbox/&gt; In addition, there are a few MP3 players that natively support Monkey's Audio, including the Cowon D2 and the Iriver Spinn.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} As of version 4.02 (19 January 2009) a directshow filter is distributed with the installer, allowing for compatibility with most mp3 players.&lt;ref name=ver/&gt;
