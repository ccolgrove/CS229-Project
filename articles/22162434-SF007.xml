'''Ipredator'''&lt;ref&gt;It is &quot;Ipredator&quot;, not &quot;IPREDator&quot;. https://www.ipredator.se/, https://www.ipredator.se/?lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[virtual private networking]] service offered by [[The Pirate Bay]] with the stated goal of providing [[internet privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://techfragments.com/news/662/Software/Meet_iPredator_-_Secure_Anonymous_VPN_from_Pirate_Bay.html|title=Meet iPredator - Secure Anonymous VPN from Pirate Bay|publisher=Tech Fragments|first=Michael|last=Horton|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a response to the introduction of [[IPRED]] in [[Sweden]], which will allow [[copyright]] holders and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] officials to request personal information about [[copyright infringement]] suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2009/03/the-pirate-bay-to-roll-out-secure-vpn-service.ars|title=The Pirate Bay to roll out secure â¬5 per month VPN service|first=Jacqui|last=Cheng|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August 2009, the beta testing invitations were sent out to those who entered their email addresses into the beta signup form. Additionally, the homepage has changed to reflect the beta. The service uses the [[Point-to-point tunneling protocol|PPTP protocol]] (supported natively in XP, Vista, Windows 7, OS X and Linux through the use of PPTP-linux) to tunnel the connection through servers (vpn.ipredator.se which resolves to multiple IP addresses) located in Sweden.

On September 14, 2009, Ipredator &quot;The Second Batch&quot; became available for public consumption.

On November 28, 2009, Ipredator became publicly available and exited the beta stage. This was done to counteract [[National Defence Radio Establishment (Sweden)|FRA]], which started listening to internet traffic over the Swedish borders on December 1. To reflect this, The Pirate Bay changed their logo on December 1, 2009, to an image from the game [[Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!]] depicting FRA as the opponent Glass Joe, which is a legendary easy opponent from the game. The image linked to Ipredator.se with the message &quot;FRA vs Ipredator - It's on!&quot;

On Windows clients, it is recommended to disable [[IPv6]], File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks and Client for Microsoft Networks because these features may disclose information  &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.instantfundas.com/2010/06/security-flaw-makes-pptp-vpn-useless.html|title=Security flaw makes PPTP VPN useless for hiding IP on BitTorrent| accessdate=2011-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As of February 2011, the service costs 149sek (about â¬17/US$23 on 21&amp;nbsp;Feb.&amp;nbsp;2011) for three months. The site accepts [[PayPal]] payments as well as credit card payments via [[AlertPay]] system.
