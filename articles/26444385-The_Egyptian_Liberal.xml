The '''Revolutionary Socialist Party''' (RSP) is a small [[socialist]] organisation in [[Australia]], formed in 2008 by a split from the former [[Democratic Socialist Perspective]] (DSP). Members of the split were expelled from the DSP over debates about the organisation's participation in the [[Socialist Alliance (Australia)|Socialist Alliance]].&lt;ref name=split&gt;[http://www.dsp.org.au/node/199 DSP National Executive statement on LPF split ], ''Democratic Socialist Perspective'', 13 May 2008.

==History==
On 13 May 2008, The DSP National Executive expelled 39 members of the '''Leninist Party Faction''' (LPF) of whom went on to form the RSP.&lt;ref name=launched/&gt; They claim to have established branches in [[Brisbane]], [[Canberra]], [[Melbourne]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsp.org.au/?q=node/17 Contact us], ''Revolutionary Socialist Party''. Accessed: 8 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately because of slow growth six members left the party in September 2011 and called for broad left support instead behind  ''Green Left Weekly'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/48776], ''Letâs unite behind Green Left Weekly''.&lt;/ref&gt;-- a journal which supports the Socialist Alliance.

==Politics==
The RSP claim to stand against [[greed]], [[exploitation]], [[war]], [[oppression]] and [[environmental destruction]] and for a [[revolution|revolutionary]] overthrow of [[capitalism]] based on the ideas of [[Karl Marx]], [[Frederick Engels]] and other socialists. They support what they call &quot;the [[Bolivia|Bolivarian]] socialist [[Bolivarian revolution|revolution]] now unfolding in [[Venezuela]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsp.org.au/?q=node/18 About the RSP], ''Revolutionary Socialist Party''. Accessed: 8 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Like the former DSP who broke with [[Leon Trotsky]]'s theory of [[permanent revolution]] in the 1980s, the RSP are advocates of the [[Two Stage Theory|two stage theory]], as Doug Lorimer of the RSP outlines in ''In Defence of Lenin's Marxist Policy of a Two-Stage, Uninterrupted Revolution:''

:''&quot;A [[Political power|state power]] which organises the [[proletariat|working class]], in alliance with the [[peasant|peasantry]] as a whole [...] to carry to completion a democratic revolution would also be a form of [[Dictatorship of the proletariat|proletarian dictatorship]], of working-class state power. But it would not yet be a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat [...] It would be a special form of proletarian state power in a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]-democratic revolution, a revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://rsp.org.au/content/november-1999-defence-lenins-marxist-policy-two-stage-uninterrupted-revolution November 1999: In Defence of Lenin's Marxist Policy of a Two-Stage, Uninterrupted Revolution], ''Revolutionary Socialist Party'', (First published by the DSP) November 1999.

Other Australian socialist organisations have labelled this theory &quot;[[Stalinist]]&quot; and in contrast with classical [[Marxism]]. The [[Socialist Party (Australia)|Socialist Party]], affiliated with the [[Committee for a Workers International]] claims the theory is &quot;a policy of deception, consistent misquotation, [and] half quotations of Trotskyâs ideas and innuendo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistpartyaustralia.org/archives/2407 The Permanent Revolution today], ''Socialist Party'', 23 February 2010.
