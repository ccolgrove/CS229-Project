The '''Land of Lincoln Trophy ''' is presented to the winner of the annual [[American football|college football]] game between [[Illinois]] rivals [[Northwestern University]], located in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], located on the border between the central Illinois cities of [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] and [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/chi-11-illinois-football-nov11,0,4736103.story | work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams began competing for the new prize in [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://nusports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/042509aab.html |title = Illinois and Northwestern Announce Football Series Trophy |date= April 25, 2009 |publisher= NUsports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the [[Sweet Sioux Tomahawk]] (1945-2008).  Illinois had led the tomahawk series, 33-29.

The trophy derives its name from the official [[List of U.S. state nicknames|state nickname]] of Illinois and depicts a bronze replica of a [[stovepipe hat]] famously worn by [[Abraham Lincoln]].  It was designed by [[Dick Tracy]] cartoonist [[Dick Locher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/chi-14-illinois-nu-trophy-brite-nov14,0,1861835.story| title = Trophy to hang their hat on| date = November 14, 2009|publisher = [[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cast by sculptor Don Reed of River's Edge Foundry, Beloit Wisconsin.

Northwestern won the inaugural game on Illinois' home field in 2009, but in 2010 the Illini returned the favor at [[Wrigley Field]]. They also won at home in 2011 by overcoming an 18 point deficit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=312740356| title = Illinois completes comeback in final minute to defeat rival Northwestern

Illinois has a 54-46-5 lead overall, but the Wildcats have narrowed the series in recent years by winning six of the last nine contests.
