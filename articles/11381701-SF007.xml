'''Usage share of operating systems''' is the percentage market share of the operating systems used in computers.
Different categories of computers use a wide variety of [[operating system]]s, and the '''usage share''' varies enormously from one category to another.

In some categories a single family of operating systems is dominant. For example, most desktop and laptop computers use Microsoft Windows and most supercomputers use Linux. In other categories, such as smartphones and servers, there is greater diversity and competition.

Information about operating system share is difficult to obtain. In most of the categories below, there is no reliable primary source or methodology for its collection.

==Desktop and laptop computers==
There is little openly published information on the usage share of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a pre-installed OS; some users replace that OS with a different one due to personal preference.  Conversely, sales underestimate usage, by not counting pirated copies. For example, in 2009, &quot;U.S. research firm IDC estimated that 80% of software sold in China last year was pirated.&quot; (Windows was mentioned, but no specific estimate for Windows was given.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/business/global/19iht-windows.html|title= Software Pirates in China Beat Microsoft to the Punch | work= The New York Times | date=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As another example, in 2007, the automated push of IE7 update onto legal copies of Windows, contrasted with web browser share statistics, led one author to &quot;estimate that 25%â35% of all Windows XP machines are illegal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seopher.com/articles/around_25_35_of_windows_xp_systems_are_pirated_calculations_included_|title=Around 25-35% of Windows XP systems are pirated (calculations included)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estimates for 2011===
:''These are current-year sales estimates, not accumulative usage share for all PCs that are in use.''

In August 2011, Gartner estimated Apple's PC market share in US as 10.7% for Q2 2011.  Apple's worldwide market share is not listed, because not in top 5; inferred to be 5% or below.  Gartner's numbers include netbooks, but not media tablets such as the iPad.  Total units in Q2 2011 from all vendors, ~85 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1744216|title=Gartner Says Worldwide PC Shipments Increased 2.3 Percent in Second Quarter of 2011 | date =13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;A Gartner forecast calls for Mac OS to ship on 4.5 percent of new PCs worldwide in 2011 and 5.2 percent in 2015. Gartner does not expect Google Chrome OS, Google Android or HP's webOS to get 'any significant market share' on PCs in the next few years, and expects Linux operating systems to remain at less than 2 percent share over the next several years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcn.com/Articles/2011/08/10/ECG-Windows-7-Top-Selling-OS-by-End-of-2011.aspx?Page=2 | title =Which operating system will be 2011's bestseller?|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple reports selling 4 million Macs in Q2 2011, the third quarter in Apple's fiscal year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/07/19Apple-Reports-Third-Quarter-Results.html |title=Apple Reports Third Quarter Results|date=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Older information===

In a speech to investors in February 2009, [[Steve Ballmer]] of [[Microsoft]] presented a slide based on Microsoft's research; while it showed no figures, the pie chart depicted Linux and Apple as each having roughly 5&amp;ndash;6% of home and business PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.osnews.com/story/21035/Ballmer_Linux_Bigger_Competitor_than_Apple | title = Ballmer: Linux Bigger Competitor than Apple | last = Holwerda | first = Thom | publisher = osnews.com | date = 25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web [[client (computing)|client]] usage share (see below) is often used as a proxy for desktop share, but many desktops are not used for web access so do not get counted in these figures. The correlation between desktop share and web client share is also being challenged by mobile web access, which rose through 1% in 2009 and 4% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/#mobile_vs_desktop-ww-monthly-200812-201011&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft's CFO Peter Klein stated in July 2010 that [[Windows 7]] now runs on more than 15% of all PCs worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toptechnews.com/story.xhtml?story_id=11300CM9DYVG|title=Windows 7, Office Drive Record Microsoft Revenue|date=23 July 2010|publisher=Top Tech News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Forrester Research]] study of desktop operating systems used in North American and European companies in 2010 found Windows 7 on 10% of all commercial desktops, Windows XP on 75% and Vista on 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/updated_2010_windows_7_commercial_adoption_outlook/q/id/58012/t/2|title=Updated 2010: Windows 7 Commercial Adoption Outlook|publisher=Forrester Research|date=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 Tim Cook of Apple claimed that 1 in 5 of desktop/laptop computers sold in the United States is a Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betanews.com/joewilcox/article/App-Store-comes-to-Mac-in-90-days-new-iLife-Suite-and-trimmer-MacBook-Air-available-now/1287600183|title=App Store comes to Mac in 90 days, new iLife Suite and trimmer MacBook Air available now|date=20 October 2010&lt;!--, 2:57 PM--&gt;|publisher=Betanews Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Web clients==

The following information on web clients is obtained from the [[User agent]] information supplied to web servers by web browsers.  This is an inexact science for a variety of reasons. For a discussion on the shortcomings see [[Usage share of web browsers#Accuracy|Usage share of web browsers]].

The most recent data from various sources published during the last six months is summarized in the table below. (All of these sources monitor a substantial number of web sites. Statistics that relate to a single web site are excluded.)

&lt;!--The format of this table has been carefully considered and discussed by editors over a period of time. Please do not change it until a consensus to do so has been reached on the talk page first.--&gt;

==Netbooks==
[[Image:$1 Netbooks.jpg|frameless|upright|right]]
The [[netbook]] market has been dominated by Microsoft Windows, with Linux in second place.

Initially, Linux dominated the netbook market when [[Asus]] started it with the [[ASUS Eee PC|Eee PC]] in October 2007, but this lead did not last long. Asus and [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], which accounted for 90% of the early netbook market, installed Linux on 30% of their machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a3VyE_ofSwwE&amp;refer=news | title = Microsoft Missing Netbook Growth as Linux Wins Sales (Update2) | first1 = Tim | last1 = Culpan | first2 = Dina | last2 = Bass | publisher = Bloomberg.com | date = 6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft responded by extending the life of Windows XP. By February 2009, Microsoft cited data from NPD Retail Tracking Service which showed that US market share of Windows on netbooks went from under 10% to 96%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/windowsexperience/archive/2009/04/03/windows-on-netbook-pcs-a-year-in-review.aspx|title=Windows on Netbook PCs: A Year in Review|publisher=Windows Experience Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, an analyst at ABI said that of the 35 million netbooks to ship globally in 2009, 68% would have Windows and 32% Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9140343/Linux_s_share_of_netbooks_surging_not_sagging_says_analyst | title = Linux's share of netbooks surging, not sagging, says analyst | first = Eric | last = Lai | publisher = computerworld.com | date = 4 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to DisplaySearch, netbooks and tablets rose from just under a 14% share of the overall portable computer market in third quarter of 2008 to around 20% in the second quarter of 2009, and remained at around 20% until the middle of 2010. During 2010, Apple's [[iPad]] tablet computer gained a 6.5% share of this market sector in the first quarter and DisplaySearch forecast this will rise to 30% in the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.reghardware.com/2010/06/17/netbooks_vs_tablets/ | title=iPad gouges netbook sales | first=Tony | last=Smith | publisher=The Register | date=17 June 2010 | accessdate = 18 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tablet computers==
[[Tablet computer]]s, or simply '''tablets''', became a significant OS market share category starting with Apple's iOS-based [[iPad]] in 2010. ~ 29 million iPads sold to date, as of June 2011.

'''2011 Sales and Estimates (millions of units):'''

iOS:  Q1: 7.3, Q2: 4.7 (limited by supply shortages)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unwiredview.com/2011/04/20/apple-unveils-fiscal-2011-q2-results-18-65-million-iphones-4-69-million-ipads-sold/|title=Apple unveils fiscal 2011 Q2 results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android: &quot;Android media tablets have collectively taken 20% market share away from the iPad in the last 12 months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abiresearch.com/press/3753-Android+Takes+20%25+Media+Tablet+Market+Share+from+iPad+in+Last+12+Months|title=Android Takes 20% Media Tablet Market Share from iPad in Last 12 Months|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Apple is set to increase its iPad shipments at a faster rate than previously expected in 2011 and beyond, causing the global media tablet market to exceed growth expectations during the next few years, according to data from information and analysis provider [[IHS Inc.|IHS]]. Apple will ship 44 million iPads in 2011; shipments expected to reach 120 million units in 2015. Apple is expected to account for 74 percent of media tablet shipments in 2011 and 43-44 percent in 2015.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isuppli.com/Display-Materials-and-Systems/News/Pages/Media-Tablet-Forecast-Increased-as-Apple%E2%80%99s-Dominance-Grows.aspx|title=Media Tablet Forecast Increased as Appleâs Dominance Grows|date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Top vendors:''' In '''Q1 2011''', '''Apple's iOS''' sold '''7.3 million tablets'''. (Q2 number not used, because was limited by supply shortages.) '''Google's Android''' shipped on '''1 - 2 million''' tablets per quarter (20% estimate by ABI).

==Mobile devices==

==Servers==
[[Image:Rack001.jpg|thumb|frameless|upright|right]]

Server [[market share]] can be measured with statistical surveys of publicly accessible servers, such as [[web server]]s, [[mail server]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.201007/mxsurvey.html|title=Mail Server Survey|publisher=Security Space|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[DNS server]]s on the Internet: the operating system powering such servers is found by inspecting raw response messages. This method gives a good insight into market share of operating systems actually installed on those servers, however it only includes servers publicly accessible on Internet.

Notes:
* W3Techs survey in August 2011 checked the top 1 million [[Web server]]s (according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]).
* Security Space survey in August 2009 checked 38,549,333 publicly accessible [[Web server]]s.
* [[Netcraft]] [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] survey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.netcraft.com/SSL-Survey/CMatch/osdv_all|title=Operating System Share by Groups for Sites in All Locations January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2009 also checked 1,014,301 publicly accessible [[Web server]]s, but the survey is only valid for SSL Web servers and it is not a good measure for our purpose.

Another method is to measure server hardware sold through commercial channels - market share by units sold or market share by revenue. However these methods undercount the share of open source operating systems currently in use, since such operating systems are usually obtained for free with or without a support plan.{{lopsided|date=October 2011}}{{cn|date=October 2011}}

==Mainframes==
[[Image:IBM System z10.jpg|frameless|upright|right]]
[[IBM System z]] has a 90-95% share of the [[mainframe computer]] hardware market.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBM-Anti-Trust&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.ccianet.org/index.asp?sid=5&amp;artid=62&amp;evtflg=False
 | title=IBM Tightens Stranglehold Over Mainframe Market; Gets Hit with Antitrust Complaint in Europe
 | publisher=Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association
 | date=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operating systems for [[IBM System z]] generation hardware include IBM's bundled proprietary [[z/OS]],&lt;ref name=&quot;IBM-Anti-Trust&quot;/&gt; [[Linux on System z]] and as at {{Start date and age|2008|10|7}} the prototype [[OpenSolaris for System z]].

[[Gartner]] reported on {{Start date and age|2008|12|23}} that [[Linux on System z]] was used on approximately 28% of the &quot;customer z base&quot; and that they expected this to increase to over 50% in the following five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;gartnovell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediaproducts.gartner.com/reprints/novell/vol3/article1/article1.html |title=Vendor Rating: Novell, 2008 |work=Gartner RAS Core Research Note G00162399 |date=23 December 2008 |accessdate = 23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of [[Linux on System z]], [[Red Hat]] and [[Novell]] compete to sell [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|RHEL]] and [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server|SLES]] respectively.

* Prior to 2006, Novell claimed a market share of 85% or more.
* Red Hat has since claimed 18.4% in 2007 and 37% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid80_gci1366811,00.html |title=Red Hat bolsters Linux for mainframes, tries to catch Novell |first=Bill |last=Claybrook |publisher=SearchDataCenter.com |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate = 23 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gartner reported at the end of 2008 that Novell had an 80% share of mainframe Linux.&lt;ref name=&quot;gartnovell&quot;/&gt;
