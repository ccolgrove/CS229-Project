==NFL Draft==
Going into the 2008 NFL Draft the teams biggest needs are at wide receiver, cornerback, and tight end. Specifically, the team's top three wide receivers were all under 5'11&quot; in height, and a large wide receiver was a high priority for the team. The Bills had a large number of selections in the 2008 draft and addressed these needs by selecting [[Leodis McKelvin]], considered by many to be the top cornerback in the draft, in round 1, and [[James Hardy (American football)|James Hardy]], a 6'5&quot; playmaking receiver also considered to be among the best in the class, in round 2. Tight end, however, was not addressed until Round 4, with the selection of [[Derek Fine]]. Depth picks filled out the rest of the draft order.

===Draft Results===
*Round 1(11)- [[Leodis McKelvin]], CB, [[Troy Trojans|Troy]]
*Round 2(41)- [[James Hardy (American football)|James Hardy]], WR, [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]]
*Round 3(72)-[[Chris Ellis (American football)|Chris Ellis]], DE, [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech]]
*Round 4(114)-[[Reggie Corner]], CB, [[Akron Zips|Akron]]
*Round 4(132)-[[Derek Fine]], TE, [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]]
*Round 5(147)-[[Alvin Bowen]], OLB, [[Iowa State Cyclones|Iowa State]]
*Round 6(179)-[[Xavier Omon]], RB, [[Northwest Missouri State University]]
*Round 7(219)-[[Demetrius Bell]], OT, [[Northwestern State University]]
*Round 7(224)-[[Steve Johnson (American football)|Steve Johnson]], WR, [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]]
*Round 7(251)-[[Kennard Cox]], DB, [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]

[[ESPN]] draft analyst [[Mel Kiper, Jr.]] gave the Buffalo Bills a C+ grade for their 2008 NFL Draft, praising the selections of McKelvin and Hardy but criticizing the selections of Corner and Fine as reaches in the 4th round.
