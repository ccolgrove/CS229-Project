'''KBGA''' (89.9 FM), licensed to [[Missoula, Montana]], is a [[college radio]] station on the campus of the [[University of Montana]]. It was formerly known as Revolution Radio.

KBGA was established by an organization of students headed by Craig J. Altmaier and has been on the air, serving its community since August 23, 1996. KBGA was consulted by and briefly collaborated with [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] in 2000. In the same year, the station was introduced to the rest of the world in the print medium as it graced the pages of the June 8 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in an article covering webcasting.
