The '''Linux Standard Base''' ('''LSB''') is a joint project by several [[Linux distribution]]s under the organizational structure of the [[Linux Foundation]] to standardize the software system structure, including the [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard|filesystem hierarchy]], used with [[Linux kernel|Linux]] [[operating system]]. The LSB is based on the [[POSIX]] specification, the [[Single UNIX Specification]], and several other open standards, but extends them in certain areas.

According to the LSB:

:The goal of the LSB is to develop and promote a set of open standards that will increase compatibility among Linux distributions and enable software applications to run on any compliant system even in binary form. In addition, the LSB will help coordinate efforts to recruit software vendors to port and write products for Linux Operating System.

The LSB compliance may be certified for a product by a certification procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Certification | title = Certifying an Application to the LSB | publisher = [[Linux Foundation]] | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSB specifies for example: standard [[library (software)|libraries]], a number of commands and utilities that extend the [[POSIX]] standard, the layout of the [[Filesystem Hierarchy Standard|file system hierarchy]], [[run level]]s, the printing system, including [[spooling|spoolers]] such as [[Common Unix Printing System|CUPS]] and tools like [[Foomatic]] and several extensions to the [[X Window System]].

==Backwards compatibility==
The LSB is designed to be binary-compatible and produce a stable [[application binary interface]] (ABI) for [[independent software vendor]]s.  To achieve backward compatibility, each subsequent version is purely additive.  In other words, interfaces are only added, not removed.  The LSB adopted an interface deprecation policy to give application developers enough time in case an interface is removed from the LSB. This allows the developer to rely on every interface in the LSB for a known time and also to plan for changes, without being surprised.  Interfaces are only removed after having been marked &quot;deprecated&quot; for at least three major versions, or roughly six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/lsb/roadmap | title = LSB Roadmap | publisher = [[Linux Foundation]] | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO standard==
The LSB is registered as an official [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO standard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43781 |title=ISO/IEC 23360-1:2006 - Linux Standard Base (LSB) core specification 3.1 -- Part 1: Generic specification |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main parts of it are:
* '''ISO/IEC 23360-1:2006''' Linux Standard Base (LSB) core specification 3.1 -- Part 1: Generic specification
* '''ISO/IEC 23360-2:2006''' Linux Standard Base (LSB) core specification 3.1 -- Part 2: Specification for IA32 architecture
* '''ISO/IEC 23360-3:2006''' Linux Standard Base (LSB) core specification 3.1 -- Part 3: Specification for IA64 architecture

There is also ISO/IEC TR 24715:2006 which identifies areas of conflict between ISO/IEC 23360 (the Linux Standard Base 3.1 specification) and the ISO/IEC 9945:2003 (POSIX) International Standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38825 | title=ISO/IEC TR 24715:2006 - Information technology -- Programming languages, their environments and system software interfaces -- Technical Report on the Conflicts between the ISO/IEC 9945 (POSIX) and the Linux Standard Base (ISO/IEC 23360) |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO/IEC 23360 and ISO/IEC TR 24715 can be freely downloaded from ISO website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ |title=ISO Publicly Available Standards |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The LSB has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271662#44 | title = bugs.debian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/blog-entry/standards-and-conversations-part-1 | title = linuxfoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://openacs.org/forums/message-view?message_id=34818 | title = openacs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.osnews.com/permalink?296712 | title = osnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for not taking input from projects, most notably the [[Debian]] project, outside the sphere of its member companies.

===Choice of RPM package format===
The LSB specifies that software packages should either be delivered as an LSB-compliant installer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/swinstall.html#SWINSTALL-INTRO | title = Chapter 22. Software Installation 22.1. Introduction | work = Linux Standard Base Core Specification 3.1 | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or (preferably) be delivered in a restricted form of the [[RPM Package Manager]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/pkgscripts.html | title = Chapter 22. Software Installation 22.3. Package Script Restrictions | work = Linux Standard Base Core Specification 3.1 | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This choice of the package format precludes the use of Debian's  [[deb (file format)|deb package format]], which predates rpm. Changing the underlying package format of the Debian distribution to satisfy the LSB is considered fairly unrealistic. The use of the deb format has not diminished since the introduction of LSB; on the contrary it has increased, especially with the advent of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].

To address this, the standard does not dictate what package format the software system must use for its own packages, merely that RPM must be supported to allow packages from third-party distributors to be installed on a conforming system.

===Limitations on Debian===
Debian has included optional support for the LSB early on, at version 1.1 in &quot;woody&quot; and 2.0 in &quot;sarge&quot;, and later 3.1 in &quot;etch&quot; and 3.2 in &quot;lenny&quot;. To use foreign LSB-compliant RPM packages, the [[end-user]] needs to use Debian's [[Alien (software)|Alien]] program to transform them into the native package format and then install them.

The LSB-specified RPM format has a restricted subset of RPM featuresâto block usage of RPM features that would be untranslatable to .deb with Alien or other package conversion programs, and vice versa, as each format has capabilities the other lacks. In practice, not all Linux binary packages are necessarily LSB-compliant, so while most can be converted between .rpm and .deb, this operation is restricted to a subset of packages.

By using Alien, Debian is LSB-compatible for all intents and purposes, but according to the description of their &lt;tt&gt;lsb&lt;/tt&gt; package,&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-lsb-package&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://packages.debian.org/stable/lsb | title = Debian -- Details of package lsb in lenny (stable) -- Linux Standard Base 3.2 support package | publisher = [[Debian Project]] | date = 2008-08-18 | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the presence of the package &quot;does not imply that we believe that Debian fully complies with the Linux Standard Base, and should not be construed as a statement that Debian is LSB-compliant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;debian-lsb-package&quot;/&gt;

In general, Debian does strive to comply with the LSB, but there may be other limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLsb | title = Debian LSB | publisher = [[Debian Project]] | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of compliance test suites===
Additionally, the compliance test suites have been criticized for being buggy and incompleteâmost notably, in 2005 [[Ulrich Drepper]] criticized the LSB for poorly written tests which can cause incompatibility between LSB-certified distributions when some implement incorrect behavior to make buggy tests work, while others apply for and receive waivers from complying with the tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;drepper-2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://udrepper.livejournal.com/8511.html | title = Do you still think the LSB has some value? | author = Drepper, Ulrich | date = 2005-09-17 | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also denounced a lack of application testing, pointing out that testing only distributions can never solve the problem of applications relying on implementation-defined behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;drepper-2005&quot;/&gt; However, the LSB test coverage has been improved significantly in recent years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Also, the [[Linux Foundation]] released a tool to address application compatibility testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/lsb/all-about-linux-application-checker | title = All About the Linux Application Checker | publisher = [[Linux Foundation]] | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
