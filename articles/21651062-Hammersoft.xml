'''JuliÃ¡n Camino''' (born 2 May 1961&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/players/arg-players-6498.html Argentina international footballers] at [[rsssf]]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[MaipÃº, Buenos Aires|MaipÃº]]) is a former [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Association football|football]] right back who won two league titles with [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] and was part of the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina squad]] for [[Copa AmÃ©rica 1983]], and since August 2011 is a member of the coaching squad of the [[Argentina national football team]] as field assistant to [[Alejandro Sabella]].

Camino was a product of the Estudiantes de La Plata youth system and became the team's right back during the 1982 season. His frequent and efficient transitions to attacking positions caused national coach (and Camino's former mentor in Estudiantes) [[Carlos Bilardo]], to call Camino to the national team in 1983.

He was in the National team for the [[1983 Copa AmÃ©rica]]. In 1984 he played for the national team playing [[Nehru Cup]] in India. In 1988 Camino came back to India to play for [[Kingfisher East Bengal F.C.]] in the Rover's Cup. While playing for East Bengal, he changed his position from Right Back to Midfield. There were 1,20,000 spectators in one of the matches he played against [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] East Bengal could not keep him longer due to financial constraints&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandabazar.in/archive/1110809/9khela1.html Camino's stint in India] at [[Anandabazar Patrika]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Leaving East Bengal, he joined [[Beitar Tel Aviv F.C.]] ( [[Now Beitar Shimshon Tel Aviv F.C.]] ) in Israel and played there for 3 years.

A noted moment in Camino's performance on the national team was a harsh foul against [[Peru national football team|Peruvian]] [[Franco Navarro]] during a [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier. Camino was not sent off, but his international career never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLZok6AtKes Video of incident]&lt;/ref&gt;. He played for several teams in Argentina and abroad before retiring in 1991.

After retirement, Camino was part of Alejandro Sabella's coaching team in Estudiantes that obtained the [[2009 Copa Libertadores]] and the [[2010%E2%80%9311_Argentine_Primera_Divisi%C3%B3n_season#Torneo_Apertura|2010 Apertura]]. When Sabella was called to coach the national team in 2011 following the sacking of [[Sergio Batista]], Sabella's staff was reassembled, including Camino, [[Claudio Gugnali]], and fitness coach [[Pablo Blanco]].
