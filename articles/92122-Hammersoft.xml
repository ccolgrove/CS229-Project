'''Interstate 93''' (abbreviated '''I-93''') is an [[Interstate Highway]] in the [[New England]] section of the [[United States]]. Its southern terminus is in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], [[Massachusetts]], in the [[Boston]] metropolitan area, at [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]];&lt;ref&gt;{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=42.208621,-71.13759&amp;spn=0.019454,0.053215&amp;t=h&amp;z=14 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; its northern terminus is near [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont|St. Johnsbury]], [[Vermont]], at [[Interstate 91]].&lt;ref&gt;{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=I-93&amp;sll=42.009555,-71.71815&amp;sspn=1.910206,3.405762&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=44.398498,-72.012548&amp;spn=0.01435,0.026608&amp;t=h&amp;z=15 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of three mainline Interstate highways whose entire route is located within the New England states, the other two being [[Interstate 89|I-89]] and [[Interstate 91|I-91]].  The largest cities along its route are [[Manchester, New Hampshire]], [[Concord, New Hampshire]] and [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].

For most of its length, Interstate 93 indirectly parallels [[U.S. Route 3]]. Particularly in [[New Hampshire]], the two highways have several interchanges with each other, as well as a concurrency through [[Franconia Notch State Park]].

===Massachusetts===
Interstate 93 begins in the south at exit 12 of [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]. I-93 begins co-signed with [[U.S. Route 1]] North. At this junction, I-95 North heads to the northwest (co-signed with [[U.S. Route 1]] South, as well as [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]], which begins at the interchange), to serve as the beltway around Boston, while I-95 South runs by itself southwest through Boston's southwestern suburbs toward [[Rhode Island]].

The first few miles of I-93 run east through [[Boston]]'s southern suburbs, passing through [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] and [[Randolph, Massachusetts|Randolph]]. In Randolph, I-93 meets the northern end of [[Route 24 (Massachusetts)|Route 24]] (Fall River Expressway/AMVETS Memorial Highway) at Exit 4. I-93 continues east into [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]], interchanging with [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]], the major freeway linking Boston to [[Cape Cod]], at Exit 7 (known locally as the &quot;[[Braintree Split]]&quot;). Route 3 North joins I-93 and US-1, and the highway turns north toward Boston.

[[Image:Boston Signs.jpg|222px|thumb|right|Signs in the [[Financial District, Boston, Massachusetts|Financial District]] of [[Boston]] point toward [[Downtown Crossing]], [[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]], Interstate 93, and [[Interstate 90]].]]
Upon turning northward, the highway is known as the [[Southeast Expressway]] through [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]], [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]] and Boston's [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] section. After the [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] connector exit, the highway officially becomes the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway]], which is also known as the [[Central Artery]], and passes beneath downtown Boston. A major intersection with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]/Interstate 90 (Exit 20) takes place just south of downtown Boston. After the massive interchange, motorists use the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]] to travel underneath the city and then use [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]] to cross the [[Charles River]]. Two exits are located in the tunnel, where the speed limit is {{convert|45|mi|km}} an hour. [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]] leaves the Artery just before the Zakim bridge via Exit 26, and [[U.S. Route 1]] leaves the Artery just after the bridge, via Exit 27 (no southbound access). From Boston through the rest of Massachusetts, [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord, NH]] appears as the control city on northbound overhead signs. The Artery ends as I-93 continues north out of the city.

I-93 continues through the northern suburbs of Boston, coming to a second intersection in Woburn with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], and Route 128, which runs congruent. Travelers going north can either change over to I-95 north to eventually reach Maine, or remain on I-93 toward New Hampshire. Farther north, in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], I-93 meets [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]], providing access to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] to the southwest and New Hampshire's [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|seacoast region]] to the northeast. Just south of the state line, I-93 crosses the [[Merrimack River]] into [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]], where it interchanges with [[Massachusetts Route 213|Route 213]], a connector between I-93 and [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]]. I-93 then crosses into [[New Hampshire]].

In all, I-93 has 48 numbered exits in Massachusetts, although several numbers are skipped in and near Boston. One noteworthy reason that some exits were removed from I-93 is to further address traffic problems in addition to converting the Central Artery from six to eight to ten lanes, by reducing the combined number of on- and off-ramps from 27 to 14.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/Highway/bigdig/facts_figures.aspx#traffic&lt;/ref&gt; Exit 48 in Methuen, just before the New Hampshire state line, is the highest-numbered exit along the entire route. Due to the highway being one of the two major Interstates that enter Boston directly ([[Interstate 90]] is the other), nearly the entire length of the highway in Massachusetts carries four lanes in each direction. Average daily traffic volumes on I-93 in the state range from 100,000 vehicles at the New Hampshire border&lt;ref name=&quot;I93&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/traffic.asp?f=&amp;C=RTE.I-%2093 |publisher=Massachusetts Highway Department |title=Traffic Counts for Rte. I-93 |accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 150,000 vehicles at the southern end at I-95&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhd.state.ma.us/traffic.asp?f=&amp;C=RTE.%20%201%20%26%20I-%2093 |publisher=Massachusetts Highway Department |title=Traffic Counts for Rte. 1 &amp; I-93 |accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; to over 200,000 vehicles through Braintree and Quincy.&lt;ref name=&quot;I93&quot; /&gt;

===New Hampshire===
Interstate 93 travels just over {{convert|131|mi|km}} in the Granite State; around two-thirds of the highway's total distance. Serving as the main interstate route in New Hampshire, it connects the state capital, [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], and its largest city, [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]]. Beyond Concord are the towns of [[Tilton, New Hampshire|Tilton]], [[Plymouth, New Hampshire|Plymouth]], and [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]].  I-93 is known as the [[Alan B. Shepard]] Highway from the Massachusetts line to [[Hooksett, New Hampshire|Hooksett]] (just north of Manchester), as the [[F.E. Everett Turnpike]] from Hooksett to Concord, and as the [[Styles Bridges]] Highway from Concord to the Vermont line.

Between the northern end of [[Interstate 293|I-293]] in Hooksett and the beginning of [[Interstate 89|I-89]] in [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]], I-93 also carries the northern end of the [[Everett Turnpike]]. There is one toll booth along this section, at Exit 11 in Hooksett; toll for passenger cars is currently $1 (50Â¢ at the ramp toll booth). This is the only toll collected along the entire length of Interstate 93. I-93 in New Hampshire is also notable for having state liquor stores serve as rest areas, which are passed just after the toll plaza, traveling north. There are separate stores on both sides of the Interstate for travelers in each direction. 

I-93 enters New Hampshire at [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]], where the current reconstruction of the Exit 1 ramps (leading to [[Mall at Rockingham Park|the Mall at Rockingham Park]]) along with the reduction of the freeway from 4 northbound lanes to only 2 tends to cause traffic backups. A rest area/welcome center is available on the northbound side of the freeway, directly before Exit 1. I-93 remains only two lanes wide in each direction for its first {{convert|18|mi|km}}, until the split with [[Interstate 293]] and the junction with [[New Hampshire Route 101]] add a third and fourth lane back to the freeway. I-93 and New Hampshire Route 101 run concurrently for about a mile before New Hampshire Route 101 heads directly east as its own freeway, serving Portsmouth and the Seacoast region. I-93 keeps three lanes of traffic in each direction until the junction with [[Interstate 89]], when each side reduces back to two, and remains a four-lane freeway through most of its journey northward, with the only exception being the [[Franconia Notch]] section.
[[Image:I-93 Franconia Notch.jpg|thumb|right|Northbound lane of Interstate 93/US Route 3 in Franconia Notch]]
It crosses the [[Merrimack River]] again before going through the state capital of [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. In Concord, [[Interstate 393]] heads directly east (co-signed with eastbound [[U.S. Route 4]] and [[U.S. Route 202]]), providing another route to the Seacoast region. Westbound U.S. Route 4 joins I-93 and runs concurrently with it until Exit 17 for Penacook, about {{convert|5|mi|km}} further north, before exiting westward. Continuing north, I-93 traverses the [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] tourist region and makes its way north through the heart of the [[White Mountains Region]]. I-93 passes through [[Franconia Notch State Park]] as a [[Super two|Super-2]] parkway.  This stretch carries a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit. For the trip through Franconia Notch, I-93 and [[U.S. Route 3]] run concurrently.

Beyond Franconia Notch State Park, U.S. 3 heads northeastward through the [[Great North Woods Region (New Hampshire)|Great North Woods region]], while I-93 runs to the northwest. The final town along I-93 in New Hampshire is [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]], served by three exits. Many motorist services are available at Exit 42. After passing through town, it crosses the [[Connecticut River]] into [[Vermont]]. The last exit along I-93 is exit 44 for [[Monroe, New Hampshire|Monroe]], through which a rest area/welcome center is accessible to travelers on both sides of the highway.

===Vermont===
[[Image:I93 stjohnsbury vt 20080920.jpg|thumb|right|Southbound I-93 at Hudson Road, [[St. Johnsbury, VT]]]]

Interstate 93 runs for only {{convert|11|mi|km}} in [[Vermont]], with only one numbered exit in the state before ending at the interchange with [[Interstate 91]] in [[St. Johnsbury]]. A rest area/welcome center is located along the northbound side of the highway for travelers entering from New Hampshire. The final few miles of the Interstate, just before its terminus, actually veer to the southwest. Vehicles bound for Canada can use northbound I-91 to reach the [[Quebec]] border crossing at that Interstate's end. The portion of I-93 in Vermont parallels both [[U.S. Route 2]] and [[Vermont Route 18]].

==History==
===Southeast Expressway===
{{Main|Southeast Expressway (Massachusetts)}}
The Southeast Expressway in and near Boston was constructed between 1954 and 1959, at the same time the Fitzgerald Expressway (Central Artery) was built. It begins at the [[Braintree Split]] and ends at the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]]. A section of the Expressway, beginning south of the Savin Hill overpass and ending just before the junction with [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]], utilizes a [[zipper lane]], in which a movable barrier carves out a reversible [[high occupancy vehicle lane]] on the non-peak side of the highway during [[rush hour]].

===Boston===

[[Image:South Bay Interchange.jpg|thumb|right|The South Bay interchange (looking south) to the [[Southeast Expressway (Massachusetts)|Southeast Expressway]] with [[Great Blue Hill]] visible in the background]]

The Central Artery, officially the [[John F. Fitzgerald Expressway]], was a section of highway in downtown Boston constructed in the 1950s and was originally designed as a fully elevated highway. This new highway was greatly disliked by the citizens of the city because it cut the heart of the city in half, cast long, dreary shadows and was an eyesore to the community. Because of the public outcry, Gov. [[John Volpe]] ordered the southern half of the highway redesigned so that it was underground; this section became known as the [[Dewey Square Tunnel]]. With the cancellation of the highway projects leading into the city in 1972 by Gov. [[Francis W. Sargent]], the Central Artery gained the designation of Interstate 93 in 1974. It has also carried the local highway designations of [[U.S. Route 1 (Massachusetts)|U.S. 1]] (since 1989) and [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]].

By the mid-1970s, I-93 had outgrown its capacity and had begun to deteriorate due a lack of maintenance. State Transportation Secretary [[Frederick P. Salvucci]], aware of the issues surrounding the elevated roadway, proposed a plan  conceived in the early 1970s by the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review]] to replace the rusting elevated six-lane Central Artery with a new, more efficient underground roadway. This plan was merged with a long-standing proposal to build a third harbor tunnel to alleviate congestion in the [[Sumner Tunnel|Sumner]] and [[Callahan Tunnel|Callahan]] tunnels to [[East Boston]]; the new plan became known as the Central Artery/Tunnel Project or the ''Big Dig''.

These new roadways were built during a twelve-year period from 1994 to early 2006. The massive project became the largest urban construction project ever undertaken in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Associated Press&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/07/12/bigdigdeath.ap/index.html | title=Review Begins After Big Dig Tunnel Collapse | publisher=CNN.com | date=2006-07-12 | accessdate=2006-07-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060715075257/http://edition.cnn.com/2006/US/07/12/bigdigdeath.ap/index.html |archivedate = July 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the new I-93 segment was not without serious issues: a lengthly Federal environmental review pushed the start of construction back from approximately 1990, causing many inflationary increases; funding for the project was the subject of several political battles between Pres. [[Ronald Reagan]] and Rep. [[Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr]]. Major construction on the new roadway was done while maintaining the old roadway, a step that also greatly increased the cost of the project. The original [[Charles River]] crossing, named Scheme Z, was the object to great public outcry similar to that of the building of the original highway. The outcry eventually led to the replacement of Scheme Z with a newer, more sleek [[cable-stayed bridge]] and complementing exit for [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], increasing the cost even more.

In Downtown Boston, I-93 is now made up of the [[Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. Tunnel]] and the [[Zakim Bunker Hill Bridge]], which spans the Charles River. The underground construction of the tunnel system was completed as of October, 2006; however, repairs continue to many parts of the tunnel due to water leakage because of improper construction of the [[slurry wall]]s supporting the O'Neill tunnel. The former route of the above-ground Artery, so named &quot;the other [[Green Monster]]&quot; by Mayor [[Thomas Menino]], was replaced mostly by open space known formally as the [[Rose Kennedy Greenway]].

Additional improvements were done in the [[South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts|South Bay]] section of the highway: The I-90/I-93 interchange was completely redesigned, a new [[HOV lane]] extending from the zipper lane in Quincy was added and the South Boston Haul road that was constructed to bypass truck traffic around residential streets in the South End is now open to general traffic.

Hazardous cargoes are now prohibited from I-93 in Boston due to safety issues in the tunnels; these cargoes must now exit at either the [[Leverett Circle]] connector in Cambridge when traveling southbound or at the Massachusetts Ave. exit when traveling northbound.

===Northern Expressway===
{{Main|Northern Expressway (Massachusetts)}}
The Northern Expressway was constructed from [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] to the New Hampshire border between 1956 and 1963.  It was extended through [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] to the [[Central Artery]], [[U.S. Route 1]], and the planned route of the [[Inner Belt]] between 1965 and 1973. Because it was already under construction, the highway was granted an exception to the moratorium on highway expansion inside Route 128 which was announced in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/northern/&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Hampshire===
Originally planned to follow the alignment of US 3 through [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] along the [[Everett Turnpike]], this was changed before construction to the current route through [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]] largely due to the intervention of the owners of [[Rockingham Park]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Exit 1 in Salem was originally designed and built with ramps allowing northbound traffic to exit to the race track and return drivers to southbound 93 only. The complementary ramps were added much later, with the southbound off ramp being a particularly tight and dangerous turn squeezed within the curve of the southbound on ramp.

An {{convert|8|mi|0|sing=on}} section of I-93 through [[Franconia Notch State Park]], called the '''Franconia Notch Parkway''' in New Hampshire, was constructed as a [[two-lane freeway]] with a median divider.  This was built as a compromise between the state's park department and highway officials.  The speed limit on the Parkway is 45&amp;nbsp;mph (70&amp;nbsp;km/h). Originally, this section's signage read &quot;U.S. 3 TO I-93&quot; in this area complete with its own exit number sequence, but this has since been replaced by I-93 and [[U.S. Route 3|US-3]] signage along the entire length of the Parkway. The exits were renumbered to Exit 34A, 34B, and 34C.

A 59-vehicle accident briefly closed the turnpike near [[Derry, New Hampshire|Derry]], Exit 4, on January 11, 2009. A bus had tried to avoid a car going out of control. There were no major injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Associated Press |title = 59-vehicle pileup closes I-93 | publisher = Burlington Free Press | date = January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 12-vehicle accident occurred the following Sunday, January 18, near the previous week's accident.  The pair of accidents has led proponents of widening the highway to urge that there be no more delays in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090130/OPINION/901300333/1017| title=Widening I-93 is now an urgent priority| author=Sherm Packard, NH State Representative | date=January 30, 2009| publisher=The Concord Monitor| accessdate=2009-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vermont===
Construction of Interstate 93 was completed in 1983 in Vermont.  It was the last interstate to be built in the state.

==Future expansion==
===Massachusetts plans===
Since 1996, MassHighway has studied rebuilding the intersection of I-93 and I-95 in [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] along the border with [[Stoneham, Massachusetts|Stoneham]] and [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9395info.com/overview.asp I-93\I-95 Interchange Transportation Study]&lt;/ref&gt; The project is expected to start in 2017 and cost $267 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.env.state.ma.us/mepa/pdffiles/certificates/052909/14279npc.pdf |title=I-93 / Route 110 / Route 113 Interchange Reconfiguration and Reconstruction Project: Draft Environmental Impact Report |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation |year=2009 |author=John Carr |co-author=David Chesler |others=Adriel Edwards; Douglas Kerr; Dan Moraseski; George Sanborn; Paul Schlichtman; Alexander Svirsky; Yanni Tsipis. |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] and its predecessor [[MassHighway]] have planned on widening I-93 to a uniform four travel lanes in both directions from the current lane drop near Exit 41 in [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]] to the New Hampshire border since the beginning of the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andoverma.gov/planning/i93/ I-93/Lowell Junction Development Area Background]&lt;/ref&gt; The first section of widening will be done as part of the I-93 Tri-Town Interchange Project. The project will construct a new interchange in Wilmington. I-93 will be widened from 3 to 4 lanes from Exit 41 to I-495, a distance of approximately {{convert|5|mi|0}}, as the first phase in widening I-93 from Exit 41 to the New Hampshire state line. Early estimates of the entire project place the cost at $567 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;br-anderson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Steve |title=Northern Expressway |url=http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/northern/ |work=BostonRoads.com |accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rapid bridge replacement project====
In September 2010, a section of a bridge in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]] when a {{convert|25|x|7|ft|adj=on}} section of bridge deck on the northbound side partially collapsed due to age-related structural fatigue.&lt;ref name=&quot;globe-moskowitz2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskowitz |first=Eric |title=Officials expect I-93 north lanes in Medford to be open for a.m. commute |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/08/pothole_forces.html|accessdate=5 August 2010|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse forced the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] to evaluate the remaining bridges along the corridor, eventually deciding to replace several bridges along the highway in a plan called 93 Fast 14. MassDOT set in motion a plan to replace the superstructure and concrete decks on 14 overpass bridges along that section of the interstate. The $98.1 million project replaced bridges originally built in 1957 with a set of prefabricated modular concrete bridges in a series of weekend roadway closures. Traffic was diverted into a series of crossover lanes during construction. The main part of the project took place each weekend from June through August 2011,with the exception of the July 4th holiday weekend. One or two bridges were replaced each weekend during the construction time frame. The project was part of the Commonwealth's Accelerated Bridge Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I-93 Medford Bridges: 93Fast14 Video |url=http://transportation.blog.state.ma.us/blog/2011/05/i-93-medford-bridges-93fast14-video.html|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation |accessdate=20 June 2011 |date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MassDot Accelerated Bridge Program: About the program |url=http://93fast14.dot.state.ma.us/about.html |publisher=Massachusetts Department of Transportation |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Hampshire plans===
Initial plans to widen I-93 to a uniform four travel lanes in both directions from [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]] to [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] beginning in 2008 were put on hold due to a lawsuit designed to force the [[New Hampshire Department of Transportation|NH Department of Transportation]] to update the plans to include other transportation options. Under orders from US District Court, the NHDOT and [[US Department of Transportation]] must provide an updated environmental review. The [[Conservation Law Foundation]] (CLF) filed a lawsuit in February 2006, hoping to force any expansion plans in the area to include the restoration of commuter rail service between Manchester and Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/08/31/i_93_widening_in_nh_set_back/ |title=I-93 widening in N.H. set back |author=James Vaznis |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2007-08-31 |accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the suit, the Exit 1 interchange construction was allowed to undergo upgrading and expansion; other associated projects related to the widening, chiefly around Exits 3 and 5, were also eventually allowed to proceed. The whole set of projects were eventually allowed to move forward when an agreement between the state and the CLF that removed the group's opposition to construction which does not pose a threat to the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;monitor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theconcordinsider.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080824/FRONTPAGE/808240337&amp;template=single |title= I-93 projects move forward, not sideways |accessdate=2008-09-13 |author=Davidson, Kate |publisher=Concord Monitor |date=2008-08-24}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 stimulus package]], New Hampshire is set to receive several million dollars in highway construction funds. One of the projects will be widening a portion of the highway between the Massachusetts border and Manchester. Bidding is set to begin in February 2009 with construction slated to begin in late 2009 or early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29249554/ |title=NH hustles for its slice of stimulus pie |author=John Distaso |work=[[New Hampshire Union Leader]] |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2009-02-20 |quote=The biggest project on its list, the $31 million widening of Interstate 93 from Salem to Manchester, will be advertised on Feb. 24, Jannelle said.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans call for the New Hampshire Department of Transportation to widen the southernmost {{convert|20|mi|km}} of I-93 to four lanes in each direction, from the current two. In addition, all five interchanges along this length will be upgraded to accommodate larger amounts of traffic, including replacing many aging bridges. Smaller construction projects at some of the interchanges are already taking place.&lt;ref name=&quot;monitor&quot; /&gt; According to plans filed by the state with US DOT, the project is scheduled to run from 2009 through 2016, with work starting at the Massachusetts line and moving northward to Manchester. The project is designed with an intermodal transit bent; new or improved park and ride facilities deployed at exits 1, 3 and 5 and a widened median strip that is designed to accommodate a planned commuter rail service between Boston and Manchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhdot-background&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rebuildingi93.com/content/background/ |title=Rebuilding 93:Salem to Manchester - Project background |last=NH Department of Transportation |publisher=NH DOT |accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a way to help defray the costs of the expansion, in early 2010 the NHDOT made a formal request to the [[Federal Highway Administration]] to add tolls to I-93 at the Massachusetts-New Hampshire border. The new toll facility was to be located in Salem, New Hampshire, approximately {{convert|.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} from the state line, and would cost travelers $2 per car. The proposal faced opposition from state legislators in both states who claimed the tolls would cause severe congestion in the area and lead to an economic burden to local residents. Opponents included US senator [[Scott Brown]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-Massachusetts).&lt;ref name=&quot;et-date&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Date |first=Terry |title=NH, Massachusetts lawmakers speak against I-93 toll |url=http://www.eagletribune.com/newhampshire/x1720285446/NH-Massachusetts-lawmakers-speak-against-I-93-toll?keyword=secondarystory |accessdate=22 May 2010 |newspaper=[[Eagle-Tribune]] |date=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was eventually dropped in favor of issuing new state bonds to pay for expansion. The new policy was laid out by Transportation Commissioner George Campbell after reviewing the proposal and receiving a promise from the [[MassDOT]] that it would not be enacting a similar toll on the Massachusetts side of the border.&lt;ref name=&quot;nt-kl&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Landrigan |first=Kevin |title=Tolls nixed to pay for I-93 widening |url=http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/statenewengland/679077-227/tolls-nixed-to-pay-for-i-93-widening.html |accessdate=22 May 2010 |newspaper=[[Nashua Telegraph]] |date=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
