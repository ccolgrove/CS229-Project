'''NetBeans''' refers to both a [[Platform (computing)|platform]] framework for Java desktop applications, and an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for developing with [[Java (programming language)|Java]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Release Notes 7.0&quot;&gt;http://netbeans.org/community/releases/70/relnotes.html&lt;/ref&gt;, [[JavaScript]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Release Notes 7.0&quot; /&gt;, [[PHP]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Release Notes 7.0&quot; /&gt;, [[Python (programming language)|Python]]&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.netbeans.org/Python&lt;/ref&gt; (no longer supported after NetBeans 7), [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Release Notes 7.0&quot; /&gt;, [[C (programming language)|C]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Release Notes 7.0&quot; /&gt;, [[C++]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Release Notes 7.0&quot; /&gt;, [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, [[Clojure]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, and others. The NetBeans IDE 7.0 no longer supports [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Ruby on Rails]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Release Notes 7.0&quot; /&gt;, but a third party has begun work on a separate plug-in.

The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run anywhere a compatible [[Java Virtual Machine|JVM]] is installed, including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Solaris. A [[Java Development Kit|JDK]] is required for Java development functionality, but is not required for development in other programming languages.

The NetBeans platform allows applications to be developed from a set of modular [[software component]]s called ''modules''. Applications based on the NetBeans platform (including the NetBeans IDE) can be extended by [[third party developer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/ platform: NetBeans Modules and Rich-Client Applications Learning Trail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
NetBeans began in 1996 as Xelfi (word play on ''[[Borland Delphi|Delphi]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.xelfi.cz/
| title=original Xelfi homepage
| accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.netbeans.org/community/articles/interviews/yarda-tulach.html
| title= Happy Birthday NetBeans - interview with Jaroslav &quot;Yarda&quot; Tulach
| publisher=Netbeans.org
| accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Java IDE student project under the guidance of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at [[Charles University]] in [[Prague]]. In 1997 Roman StanÄk formed a company around the project and produced commercial versions of the NetBeans IDE until it was bought by [[Sun Microsystems]] in 1999. Sun open-sourced the NetBeans IDE in June of the following year. Since then,  the NetBeans community has continued to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.netbeans.org/about/history.html
| title=A Brief History of NetBeans
| publisher=Netbeans.org
| accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sun (and thus NetBeans) [[Sun acquisition by Oracle|was acquired]] by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]. 

=== Current versions ===
NetBeans IDE 6.0 introduced support for developing IDE modules and rich client applications based on the NetBeans platform, a Java Swing [[GUI]] builder (formerly known as &quot;Project Matisse&quot;), improved [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] support, [[WebLogic]] 9 and [[JBoss]] 4 support, and many editor enhancements. NetBeans 6 is available in official repositories of major Linux distributions.

NetBeans IDE 6.5, released in November 2008, extended the existing [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] features (including Java Persistence support, EJB 3 and JAX-WS). Additionally, the NetBeans Enterprise Pack supports development of Java EE 5 enterprise applications, including [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] visual design tools, XML schema tools, web services orchestration (for BPEL), and [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] modeling. The [[NetBeans#NetBeans_IDE_Bundle_for_C.2FC.2B.2B|NetBeans IDE Bundle for C/C++]] supports C/C++ and FORTRAN development.

NetBeans IDE 6.8 is the first IDE to provide complete support of Java EE 6 and the [[GlassFish|GlassFish Enterprise Server v3]]. Developers hosting their open-source projects on [[Project Kenai|kenai.com]] additionally benefit from instant messaging and issue tracking integration and navigation right in the IDE, support for web application development with PHP 5.3 and the Symfony framework, and improved code completion, layouting, hints and navigation in JavaFX projects.

NetBeans IDE 6.9, released in June 2010, added support for [[OSGi]], [[Spring Framework]] 3.0, Java EE dependency injection (JSR-299), [[Zend Framework]] for [[PHP]], and easier code navigation (such as &quot;Is Overridden/Implemented&quot; annotations), formatting, hints, and refactoring across several languages.

NetBeans IDE 7.0 was released in April 2011. On August 1, 2011, the NetBeans Team released NetBeans IDE 7.0.1, which has full support for the official release of the [[Java version history#Java SE 7 .28July 28.2C 2011.29|Java SE 7]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== NetBeans Platform ==

The '''NetBeans Platform''' is a reusable [[Software framework|framework]] for simplifying the development of [[Java Swing]] desktop applications. The NetBeans IDE bundle for Java SE contains what is needed to start developing NetBeans plugins and NetBeans Platform based applications; no additional SDK is required.

Applications can install modules dynamically. Any application can include the Update Center module to allow users of the application to download [[Digital signature|digitally-signed]] upgrades and new features directly into the running application. Reinstalling an upgrade or a new release does not force users to download the entire application again.

The platform offers reusable services common to desktop applications, allowing developers to focus on the logic specific to their application. Among the features of the platform are:
* User interface management (e.g. menus and toolbars)
* User settings management
* Storage management (saving and loading any kind of data)
* Window management
* Wizard framework (supports step-by-step dialogs)
* NetBeans Visual Library
*Integrated Development Tools

== NetBeans IDE ==
'''NetBeans IDE''' is an [[open source|open-source]] integrated development environment. NetBeans IDE supports development of all Java application types ([[Java Platform, Standard Edition|Java SE]] including JavaFX, ([[Java Platform, Mobile Edition|Java ME]], [[Web application|web]], [[EJB]] and [[MIDlet|mobile]] applications) out of the box. Among other features are an [[Apache Ant|Ant]]-based project system, Maven support, [[refactoring]]s, [[Version control system|version control]] (supporting [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]], [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]], [[Mercurial (software)|Mercurial]] and [[Clearcase]]).

'''Modularity''': All the functions of the IDE are provided by modules. Each module provides a well defined function, such as support for the [[Java (programming language)|Java language]], editing, or support for the [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] versioning system, and SVN. NetBeans contains all the modules needed for Java development in a single download, allowing the user to start working immediately. Modules also allow NetBeans to be extended. New features, such as support for other programming languages, can be added by installing additional modules. For instance, [[Sun Studio Compiler Suite|Sun Studio]], Sun Java Studio Enterprise, and [[Sun Java Studio Creator]] from [[Sun Microsystems]] are all based on the NetBeans IDE.

'''License''': From July 2006 through 2007, NetBeans IDE was licensed under Sun's [[Common Development and Distribution License]] (CDDL), a license based on the [[Mozilla Public License]] (MPL). In October 2007, Sun announced that NetBeans would henceforth be offered under a [[dual license]] of the CDDL and the [[GPL]] version 2 licenses, with the [[GPL linking exception]] for [[GNU Classpath]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netbeans.org/gplv2-faqs.html Why dual license Netbeans faq]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrated modules ==
These modules are part of the NetBeans IDE.

=== NetBeans Profiler ===
The '''NetBeans Profiler'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://profiler.netbeans.org/
| title=Profiler
| publisher=Netbeans.org
| accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a tool for the monitoring of Java applications: It helps developers find memory leaks and optimize speed. Formerly downloaded separately, it is integrated into the core IDE since version 6.0.

The [[Profiler (computer science)|Profiler]] is based on a Sun Laboratories research project that was named JFluid. That research uncovered specific techniques that can be used to lower the overhead of profiling a Java application. One of those techniques is dynamic bytecode instrumentation, which is particularly useful for profiling large Java applications. Using dynamic bytecode instrumentation and additional algorithms, the NetBeans Profiler is able to obtain runtime information on applications that are too large or complex for other profilers. NetBeans also support Profiling Points that let you profile precise points of execution and measure execution time.

=== GUI design tool ===
Formerly known as ''project Matisse'', the GUI design-tool enables developers to prototype and design [[Swing (Java)|Swing]] [[Graphical user interface|GUIs]] by dragging and positioning GUI components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.netbeans.org/features/java/swing.html
| title=Swing GUI Builder (formerly Project Matisse)
| publisher=Netbeans.org
| accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GUI builder also has built-in support for JSR 296 ([[Swing Application Framework]]), and JSR 295 (Beans Binding technology).

=== NetBeans JavaScript editor ===
The NetBeans JavaScript editor provides extended support for [[JavaScript]], Ajax, and [[CSS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://wiki.netbeans.org/JavaScript
| title=Javascript
| publisher=Netbeans wiki
| date=2007-03-31
| accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.netbeans.org/features/web/web-app.html
| title=Java Web Applications
| publisher=Netbeans.org
| accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JavaScript editor features comprise [[syntax highlighting]], [[Code refactoring|refactoring]], [[Autocomplete|code completion]] for native objects and functions, generation of JavaScript class skeletons, generation of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] [[Callback (computer science)|callbacks]] from a template; and automatic [[JavaScript#Compatibility considerations|browser compatibility]] checks.

CSS editor features comprise [[Autocomplete|code completion]] for styles names, quick navigation through the navigator panel, displaying the CSS rule declaration in a List View and file structure in a Tree View, sorting the outline view by name, type or declaration order (List &amp; Tree), creating rule declarations (Tree only), refactoring a part of a rule name (Tree only).

== NetBeans IDE Download Bundles ==
Users can choose to download NetBeans IDE bundles tailored to specific development needs. Users can also download and install all other features at a later date directly through the NetBeans IDE.

=== NetBeans IDE Bundle for Web and Java EE === &lt;!-- This section is linked from NetBeans --&gt;
