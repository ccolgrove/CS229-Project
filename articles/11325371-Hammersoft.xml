Heinemann Prize.

Frenchâs next book, ''Liberty or Death â Indiaâs Journey to Independence and Division'' was published in 1997 and earned the author accolades and brickbats in equal parts. Described in the Indian media as presenting a ârevisionist viewâ of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]âs role in the [[Indian Independence movement]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?203970 Gandhi was a wily Politician, Jinnah remained a secularist till Death] Outlook Magazine. August 6, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  there were a few calls to ban the book in [[India]].

Published in 2003, ''Tibet, Tibet: A Personal History Of A Lost Land'' was Frenchâs third book. According to the authorâs own accounts, his interest in [[Tibet]] was triggered by a meeting he had with the [[Dalai Lama]] when he was 16. The book though emerged out of âa gradual nervousness that the western idea of Tibet, particularly the views of Tibet campaigners, was becoming too detached from the reality of what Tibet was like. So I did a long journey through Tibet in 1999.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/fullprint.asp?choice=1&amp;fodname=20030310&amp;fname=french&amp;sid=1 Interview: Nandini Lal on Patrick French] Outlook Magazine.
