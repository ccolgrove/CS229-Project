==Wormwood in the Bible==
Although the word ''wormwood'' appears several times in the [[Old Testament]], translated from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term &lt;span style=&quot;font-family:SBL Hebrew, Ezra SIL SR, Ezra SIL, Cardo, Chrysanthi Unicode, TITUS Cyberbit Basic, Arial Unicode MS, Narkisim, Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;××¢× ×&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (''la'anah''), e.g., [[Deuteronomy]] 29:18 and [[Jeremiah]] 9:15, its only clear reference as a named entity occurs in the [[New Testament]], in the [[Book of Revelation]]: &quot;And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the springs of water; And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and a third of the waters became Bitter; and many people had died of the waters, because they were made bitter.&quot; (Revelation 8:10, 11 - [[King James Bible|KJB]]).

==Interpretations of Revelation 8:10==

Certain commentators have held that this &quot;great star&quot; represents one of several important figures in political or ecclesiastical history,&lt;ref&gt;Henry, Matthew, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/henry/mhc6.xxvii.ix.html ''Commentary on the Whole Bible Volume VI (Acts to Revelation)'': Revelation Chap. VIII], Public domain, Library of Congress call no: BS490.H4, at [http://www.ccel.org/ Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  while other Bible dictionaries and commentaries view the term as a reference to a celestial being. ''A Dictionary of The Holy Bible'' states, &quot;the star called Wormwood seems to denote a mighty prince, or power of the air, the instrument, in its fall.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rand, W. W. (1859), ''A Dictionary of the Holy Bible: for general use in the study of the scriptures; with engravings, maps, and tables'', [http://ia301314.us.archive.org/1/items/dictionholybible00randrich/dictionholybible00randrich_djvu.txt Entry: '''WORM WOOD'''] at [http://www.archive.org archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historist interpretations===
Various religious groups and figures, including [[Seventh-day Adventists]] and the theologians [[Matthew Henry]] and [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Gill&quot;&gt;Gill, John, ''Exposition of the Entire Bible'', [http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/GillsExpositionoftheBible/gil.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=008&amp;verse=010&amp;next=011&amp;prev=009 Revelation 8:10] at [http://bible.crosswalk.com/ bible.crosswalk.com]&lt;/ref&gt; regard the verses of Revelation 8 as symbolic references to past events in human history.  In the case of Wormwood, some [[Historicism (Christian eschatology)|historist]] interpreters believe that this figure represents the army of the [[Huns]] as led by king [[Attila the Hun|Attila]], pointing to chronological consistencies between the timeline of prophecy they have accepted and the history of the Huns' campaign in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nichol, Francis D (1957), ''The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary'', Volume 7, Revelation, p. 789, Review and Herald Publishing Association, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;  Others point to [[Arius]], the emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], [[Origen]] or the [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[monasticism|monk]] [[Pelagius]], who denied the doctrine of [[Original sin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;/&gt;

===Futurist interpretations===

Various scientific scenarios have been theorized on the effects of an [[asteroid]] or [[comet]]'s collision with Earth.  An applicable scenario theorizes a chemical change in the atmosphere due to &quot;heat shock&quot; during entry and/or impact of a large asteroid or comet, reacting oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere to produce nitric-acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hoopermuseum.earthsci.carleton.ca/impacts/atmchg.htm Hooper Virtual Natural History Museum citing Prinn and Fegley, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; Acid rain from the heat shock of a large comet or asteroid's impact with Earth is believed by some to fit the Biblical description of the bitterness produced by the Wormwood Star upon a third of the Earth's potable water. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.messianic-literary.com/comet.htm The Messianic Literary Corner]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative interpretations===
A number of Bible scholars consider the term ''Wormwood'' to be a purely symbolic representation of the bitterness that will fill the earth during troubled times, noting that the [[Absinth Wormwood|plant]] for which Wormwood is named, ''[[Artemisia absinthium]]'', or [[Mugwort]], ''[[Artemisia vulgaris]]'', is a known Biblical metaphor for things that are unpalatably bitter.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. W. (1891), ''The People's New Testament'', [http://www.ccel.org/j/johnson_bw/pnt/PNT27-08.HTM The Revelation of John, Chapter VIII: The Seventh Seal Opened] at the [http://www.ccel.org Christian Classics Ethereal Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.crosswalk.com/Commentaries/GenevaStudyBible/gen.cgi?book=re&amp;chapter=008 Revelation] in the ''Geneva Study Bible'' (1599) at [http://bible.crosswalk.com bible.crosswalk.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
One interesting theory is that nuclear weaponry could be called ''wormwood''. For example: Ukrainian [[:uk:ÐÐ¾Ð»Ð¸Ð½_Ð·Ð²Ð¸ÑÐ°Ð¹Ð½Ð¸Ð¹#ÐÐ°Ð·Ð²Ð°|synonymy 'wormwood']].  They do poison the water where they are detonated, thus explaining the correlation. Some&lt;ref&gt; e.g. [http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/chernobyl_wormwood.htm here at ''www.theforbiddenknowledge.com''] and [http://lynusobrien.com/odds-and-ends/is-chernobyl-wormwood here]&lt;/ref&gt; even point to the [[Chornobyl disaster]] as a possible fulfillment of this prophecy, as the name [[Chernobyl#Name origin|Chornobyl]] is said to translate to &quot;wormwood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The city is named after the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] word for [[Artemisia vulgaris|mugwort]] or wormwood (''Artemisia vulgaris''), which is ÑÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð±Ð¸Ð»Ñ &quot;chornobyl&quot;. The word is a combination of the words ''chornyi'' (ÑÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð¸Ð¹, black) and ''byllia'' (Ð±Ð¸Ð»Ð»Ñ, grass blades or stalks), hence it literally means black grass or black stalks. That may signify burnt grass, perhaps prior to cultivation.&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly [[elliptical orbit]] of a [[Brown Dwarf]] [[star]] at the edge of the [[Oort cloud]] may also be a similar culprit that is beginning to gain attention for causing [[Extinction Level Event]]s on [[Earth]] every 26-27 million years.  Some scientists even name this [[hypothetical]] object as [[Nemesis (star)|Nemesis]].  Still, other scientists attribute the disturbance in the [[Oort]] system to the highly elliptical orbit of [[90377 Sedna]], every 10,000 to 15,000 years, suggesting that this disturbance may have caused an [[impact event]] that created [[Burckle Crater]] and a subsequent [[megatsunami]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], recorded as the great [[Flood]] in the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] and in the [[Book of Genesis]].
