'''AnyDVD''' is a [[Microsoft Windows]] [[device driver|driver]] allowing decryption of [[DVD]]s [[on-the-fly]], as well as targeted removal of copy preventions and [[User operation prohibition| user operation prohibitions (UOPs)]]. With an upgrade, it will also do the same for [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. The AnyDVD program runs in the background, making discs unrestricted and [[Regional lockout|region-free]]. In addition to removing digital restrictions, AnyDVD will also defeat [[Macrovision]] [[Macrovision#Content_protection_.28RipGuard_and_Analog_Copy_Protection.29|analog copy prevention]]. Analog prevention distorts the video signal to prevent high quality copying from the output. AnyDVD is also able to remove copy-prevention from [[Sound recording|audio]] CDs.

As of version 6.1.4.3, AnyDVD has a revised ripper that removes [[Sony]] [[ARccOS Protection]], [[Macrovision]] [[Macrovision#RipGuard|RipGuard]], and other structural preventions and repairs both intentional and unintentional mastering errors. It ensures strict compliance with third-party tools, particularly [[DVD Shrink]] and Nero Recode.

The ripper module is based on code from Elby's [[CloneDVD]]. Previous versions used a ripper based on FixVTS, but FixVTS was recently shut down by legal threats from Sony.

== Advanced technical characteristics ==
On February 17, 2007, SlySoft released ''AnyDVD HD''. The program comes with the same functionality as AnyDVD, but with additional features for full [[HD DVD]] support, including decryption of [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] encrypted HD DVD movie discs. Support for AACS encryption and Region Code removal from [[Blu-ray Disc]]s was added in version 6.1.3.0, released March 5, 2007.

Besides dealing with DVD copying issues, AnyDVD can also work in the background to automatically detect and remove additional data sessions contained on Audio CDs which contain copy-prevention measures. This allows  audio tracks to be directly accessed on the system for direct playback and for access by CD extraction software. Intentional tracking errors in the audio may also be discovered, for example, those errors involved with [[key2Audio#key2AudioXS|key2AudioXS]], which may cause major skipping distortions in the ripped audio tracks. By bypassing these methods AnyDVD can provide clean, distortion-free playback and ripping.

On March 19, 2008, SlySoft released version 6.4.0.0 of AnyDVD HD, which removes [[BD+]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=14787 AnyDVD (HD) 6.4.0.0]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Blu-ray software players have removed the ability of movie playback from folders on a hard drive.  AnyDVD HD has since included the ability to rip movies to an ISO format.

== Legal issues ==
Advertising, sale, and lending of AnyDVD is outlawed in [[Germany]] (but possession and use on personally owned media is not), as it removes copy prevention from DVDs. The [[Heinz Heise|Heise news portal]] was sued by the record industry for linking to SlySoft's website in a news report. The publisher subsequently counter sued with claims of violation of their constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press and has as of April [[2007]] lost two appeal proceedings. The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|German Federal Constitutional Court]] has decided not to rule on Heise's appeal for the time being because remedies in the ordinary courts had not been exhausted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rk20070103_1bvr193605.html Ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010 the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] decided in favor of Heise. This verdict is now legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Heise-vs-Musikindustrie-Bundesgerichtshof-verwirft-Link-Verbot-1108479.html Article on heise news portal about the final appeal (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;
The legal status of AnyDVD in other countries is unclear.
