'''Microsoft Office''' is a [[Proprietary_software|non-free]] [[commercial software|commercial]] [[office suite]] of inter-related desktop applications, servers and services for the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] operating systems, introduced by Microsoft in August 1, 1989. Initially a marketing term for a bundled set of applications, the first version of Office contained [[Microsoft Word]], [[Microsoft Excel]], and [[Microsoft PowerPoint]]. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] data integration and Microsoft [[Visual Basic for Applications]] scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the [[Office Business Applications]] brand.

The current versions are [[Microsoft Office 2010|Office 2010]] for Windows, released on June 15, 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/office2010/archive/2010/06/15/office-2010-availability.aspx | title=Office 2010 Availability | work=Microsoft Office 2010 Engineering | publisher=Microsoft | date=June 15, 2010 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft Office for Mac 2011|Office 2011]] for Mac OS X, released October 26, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;macworld_office_2011&quot;/&gt;

It was the first version of Office also released on CD-ROM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pipeline|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=February 15, 1993|page=16|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ujsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, '''The Microsoft Office Professional'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Microsoft Office Professional Advertisement|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=July 5, 1993 |pages=17â19|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QzsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released, which added Microsoft Access 1.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Microsoft Office gets Access | newspaper=InfoWorld | last=Willett | first=Shawn| last2 =Barney | first2=Doug | date=May 10, 1993 | page=111 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QTsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, '''Microsoft Office 4.0''' was released containing Word 6.0, Excel 4.0, PowerPoint 3.0 and Mail. Word's version number jumped from 2.0 to 6.0 so that it would have the same version number as the MS-DOS and Macintosh versions (Excel and PowerPoint were already numbered the same as the Macintosh versions).

'''Microsoft Office 4.2 for Windows NT''' was released in 1994 for i386, Alpha, &lt;ref&gt; [http://d2ca.org/ss-gallery-winnt2k-commercial.html WindowsÂ® NT/2000 Commercial Screen Shot Gallery: Dan's 20th Century Abandonware] &lt;/ref&gt; MIPS and PowerPC &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MICROSOFT+ANNOUNCES+WORD+6.0+AND+MICROSOFT+EXCEL+5.0+FOR+WINDOWS+NT...-a015839910 Microsoft announced Word 6.0 and Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT Workstation]&lt;/ref&gt; architectures, containing Word 6.0 and Excel 5.0 (both 32-bit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MICROSOFT+READIES+SUPPORTING+VERSIONS+OF+MICROSOFT+EXCEL+AND+WORD+FOR...-a017013735 Microsoft readies supporting versions of Microsoft Excel and Word for Windows NT The PowerPC]&lt;/ref&gt;  PowerPoint 4.0 (16-bit), and Microsoft Office Manager 4.2 (the precursor to the Office Shortcut Bar).

'''Microsoft Office 4.3''' was released as the last 16-bit version, containing Word 6.0, Excel 5.0, PowerPoint 4.0. Office 4.3 (plus Access 2.0 in the Pro version) is the last version to support [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.x]], [[Windows NT 3.1]] and [[Windows NT 3.5]]. Windows NT 3.51 was supported up to and including Office 97.

'''[[Microsoft Office 95]]''' was released in August 1995. Again, the version numbers were altered to create parity across the suiteâevery program was called version 7.0 meaning all but Word missed out versions. It was designed as a fully [[32-bit]] version to match [[Windows 95]]. Office 95 was available in two versions, Office 95 Standard and Office 95 Professional. The standard version consisted of Word 7.0, Excel 7.0, PowerPoint 7.0, and [[Schedule+|Schedule+ 7.0]]. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus Access 7.0. If the professional version was purchased in [[CD-ROM]] form, it also included [[Microsoft Bookshelf|Bookshelf]].

'''[[Microsoft Office 97]]''' (Office 8.0), was a major [[Milestone (project management)|milestone]] release. It included hundreds of new features and improvements, introduced [[command bar]]s, a paradigm in which menus and [[toolbar]]s were made more similar in capability and visual design. Office 97 also featured [[Natural language processing|Natural Language Systems]] and grammar checking. Office 97 was the first version of Office to include the [[Office Assistant]].

'''[[Microsoft Office 2000]]''' (Office 9.0) introduced [[adaptive]] menus, where little-used options were hidden from the user. It also introduced a new security feature, built around [[digital signature]]s, to diminish the threat of macro viruses. Office 2000 automatically trusts [[macro (computer science)|macros]] (written in VBA 6) that were digitally signed from authors who have been previously designated as trusted. Office 2000 is the last version to support [[Windows 95]].

'''[[Microsoft Office XP]]''' (Office 10.0 or Office 2002) was released in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], and was a major upgrade with numerous enhancements and changes over Office 2000. Office XP introduced the [[Safe Mode]] feature, which allows applications such as Outlook to boot when it might otherwise fail. Safe Mode enables Office to detect and either repair or bypass the source of the problem, such as a corrupted [[Windows registry|registry]] or a faulty add-in. [[Smart tag (Microsoft)|Smart tag]] is a technology introduced with Office XP. Some smart tags operate based on user activity, such as helping with typing errors. These smart tags are supplied with the products, and are not programmable. For developers, though, there is the ability to create custom smart tags. In Office XP, custom smart tags could work only in Word and Excel. Microsoft Office XP includes integrated voice command and text dictation capabilities, as well as [[handwriting recognition]]. Office XP is the last version to support [[Windows 98]], [[Windows ME|ME]] and [[Windows NT 4.0|NT 4.0]]. It was the first version to require [[Product Activation]] as an anti-piracy measure, which attracted widespread controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;winitpro_activation&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/windows-2000/office-xp-product-activation-a-personal-saga.aspx | title=Office XP Product Activation: A Personal Saga | last=Chernicoff | first=David | work=Windows IT Pro | date=June 22, 2001 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Microsoft Office 2003]]''' (Office 11.0) was released in 2003. It featured a new logo. Two new applications made their debut in Office 2003: [[Microsoft InfoPath]] and [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]]. It is the first version to use Windows XP style icons. Outlook 2003 provides improved functionality in many areas, including [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] authentication, [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] over HTTP, Cached Exchange Mode, and an improved junk mail filter. 2003 is the last Office version to support [[Windows 2000]].

'''[[Microsoft Office 2007]]''' (Office 12.0) was released in 2007. Office 2007's new features include a new [[graphical user interface]] called the Fluent User Interface,&lt;ref name=&quot;office2007_fluent&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/bb736211.aspx |title =Microsoft Office 2007 Fluent User Interface Resource Center | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate = October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the menus and toolbars that have been the cornerstone of Office since its inception with a tabbed toolbar, known as the [[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon]]; new XML-based file formats called [[Office Open XML]]; and the inclusion of [[Microsoft Groove|Groove]], a [[collaborative software]] application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/reviews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=194400938 | title= Review: A Comprehensive Look At Microsoft Office 2007 | first=Rick | last=Scott | first2=David | last2=DeJean | first3=Serdar | last3=Yegulalp | work=InformationWeek | date=November 20, 2006 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Microsoft Office 2010]]''' (Office 14.0) was finalized on April 15, 2010, and was made available to consumers on June 15, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;office2010_pr&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | url= http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2010/jun10/06-152010OfficeLaunchPR.mspx | title=Microsoft Office 2010 Now Available for Consumers Worldwide | publisher=Microsoft | date=June 10, 2010 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.neowin.net/news/office-14-slated-for-a-20092010-release|title= Office 14 slated for a 2009/2010 Release|work=Neowin.net|date=2007-02-15|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main features of Office 2010 include the backstage file menu, new collaboration tools, a customizable ribbon, protected view and a navigation pane. This is the first version to ship in 32- and 64-bits. Microsoft Office 2010 also features a new logo, which is similar to the 2007 logo, except in gold, and with a slightly modified shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/office-2010-new-logo-outlook-and-user-interface/1475|title=Office 2010: new logo, Outlook, and user interface|date=April 18, 2009|first= Zack | last=Whittaker | work=ZDNet | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service Pack 1 for Office 2010 was released on June 28th, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.officeforlawyers.com/tips/Office2010SP1.htm Microsoft Office 2010 - Service Pack 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Microsoft Office 2012]]''' is reportedly in Build 15.0.2703.1000, and has reached Milestone 2. It sports a revamped application interface; the interface is based on [[Metro Design Language]], the interface of [[Windows Media Center]] for [[Windows Phone 7]]. Microsoft Outlook has received the most pronounced changes so far; for example, the Metro interface enables users to have access to a new visualization for scheduled tasks. PowerPoint will include more templates and transition effects, and OneNote a new splash screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.office-2012.com/microsoft-office-2012-15-0-2703-1000-first-look-with-full-screenshots/ |title=Microsoft Office 2012 15.0.2703.1000: First Look with Full Screenshots â Office 2012 |publisher=Office-2012.com |date=2011-03-16 |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2011, new images of Office 15 were revealed, showing Excel with a tool for filtering data in a storm, the ability to convert Roman numerals to Arabic numerals, and the integration of advanced trigonometric functions. In Word, the capability of inserting video and audio online as well as the broadcasting of documents on the Web were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/office-15-build-15027031000-images-leak |title=Office 15 Build 15.0.2703.1000 images leak |publisher=Neowin.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macintosh versions===
Prior to packaging its various office-type Macintosh software applications into Office, Microsoft released Mac versions of [[Microsoft Word|Word]] 1.0 in 1984, the first year of the Macintosh computer; [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] 1.0 in 1985; and [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] 1.0 in 1987.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/E/0/4E01F3E7-53CF-4744-9BBB-876F69FA1683/MacBUHistoryFS.doc | title=History of the Microsoft Macintosh Business Unit| format=[[DOC (computing)|Microsoft Word format]] | date=August 2009 | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft does not include its [[Microsoft Access|Access]] [[database]] application in Office for Mac.

Microsoft has noted that some features are added to Office for Mac before they appear in Windows versions, such as Office for Mac 2001's Office Project Gallery and PowerPoint Movie feature, which allows users to save presentations as QuickTime movies.&lt;ref name=macfirst&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1999/04-26macoffice.mspx | title=Office Macintosh Edition: A History of &quot;Mac-First&quot; Technology | publisher=Microsoft | date=April 26, 1999 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=morefirsts&gt;{{cite press release | url= http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2000/Oct00/Office2001PR.mspx | title=Microsoft Office 2001 for Mac Available Nationwide | publisher=Microsoft | date=October 11, 2000 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Microsoft Office for Mac has been long criticized for its lack of support of [[Unicode]] and [[Bi-directional text|right-to-left]] languages, notably [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heardworld.com/higgaion/?p=774 | work=Higgaion | title=It's official: no RTL support in Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac | first=Chris| last=Heard | date=September 27, 2007 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.officeformac.com/ms/blogs/blog1/I-know-I-ve-spelled-this-right | work=Mac Mojo: The Office for Mac Team Blog | title=I know I've spelled this right! | first=Eric | last=Paquin | date= August 3, 2010 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Microsoft Office''' was introduced for Macintosh in 1989, before Office was released for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_02/b4066000498753.htm | title=Microsoft and Mac, Happy Together | work=Business Week | first=Stephen H. | last=Wildstrom | date=January 3, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included Word 4.0, Excel 2.2, PowerPoint 2.01, and Mail 1.37.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;infoworld_macoffice1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lzAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA17 | title=The Microsoft Office Bundles 4 Programs | last=Flynn | first=Laurie | work=InfoWorld | page=37 | date=June 19, 1989 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally a limited-time promotion but later became a regular product. With the release of Office on CD-ROM later that year, Microsoft became the first major Mac publisher to put its applications on CD-ROM.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoworld_macoffice2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vDAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT4 | title=Microsoft Office Programs Will Be Available on CD ROM | last=Flynn | first=Laurie | work=InfoWorld | page=5 | date= August 7, 1989 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Microsoft Office 1.5 for Mac''' was released in 1991 and included the updated Excel 3.0, the first application to support Appleâs [[System 7]] [[operating system]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

'''Microsoft Office 3.0 for Mac''' was released in 1992. It included Word 5.0, Excel 4.0, and PowerPoint 3.0. Excel 4.0 was the first application to support the new [[AppleScript]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

'''Microsoft Office 4.2 for Mac''' was released in 1994. (Version 4.0 was skipped to synchronize version numbers with Office for Windows.)

'''[[Microsoft Office 98 Macintosh Edition]]''' was unveiled at [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld Expo/San Francisco]] in 1998. It introduced the [[Internet Explorer]] 4.0 [[web browser]] and [[Outlook Express]], an Internet [[e-mail]] [[client (computing)|client]] and [[usenet newsgroup]] reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1998/jan98/applepr.mspx | title=Microsoft Unveils Office 98 Macintosh Edition and Internet Explorer 4.0 for Macintosh; Apple Introduces Mac OS 8.1 With Internet Explorer as Default Browser | publisher=Microsoft | date=January 6, 1998 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Office 98 was re-engineered by Microsoft's [[Macintosh Business Unit]] to satisfy customers' desire for software they felt was more Mac-like.&lt;ref name=macfirst/&gt; It included [[Drag-and-drop|dragâand-drop]] installation, self-repairing applications and Quick [[Thesaurus]], before such features were available in Office for Windows.

'''[[Microsoft Office 2001]]''', launched in 2000, was the last Office suite for the classic [[Mac OS]]; it required Mac OS 8, although version 8.5 or later was recommended. Office 2001 introduced [[Microsoft Entourage|Entourage]], an e-mail client that included information management tools such as a calendar, an address book, task lists and notes.&lt;ref name=morefirsts/&gt;

'''[[Microsoft Office v.

This Mac version of Outlook is intended to make the Mac version of Office work better with Microsoft's Exchange server and with those using Office for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Hughes | first=Neil | url = http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/08/13/microsoft_announces_outlook_for_mac_coming_next_year.html|title=Microsoft says Office 2010, Outlook for Mac coming next year|publisher=AppleInsider|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Office 2011 includes a Mac-based Ribbon similar to Office for Windows.

==Components==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
===Desktop applications===
====Word====
{{Main|Microsoft Word}}

[[Microsoft Word]] is a [[word processor]] and was previously considered the main program in Office. Its proprietary [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] format is considered a ''[[de facto]]'' standard, although Word 2007 can also use a new XML-based, Microsoft Office-optimized format called .DOCX, which has been standardized by [[Ecma International]] as [[Office Open XML]] and its SP2 update will support [[OpenDocument|ODF]] and [[Portable Document Format|PDF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx | title= Microsoft Expands List of Formats Supported in Microsoft Office | publisher=Microsoft | date= May 21, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Word is also available in some editions of [[Microsoft Works]]. It is available for the Windows and Mac platforms. The first version of Word, released in the autumn of 1983, was for the MS-DOS operating system and had the distinction of introducing the mouse to a broad population. Word 1.0 could be purchased with a bundled mouse, though none was required. Following the precedents of LisaWrite and MacWrite, Word for Macintosh attempted to add closer WYSIWYG features into its package. Word for Mac was released in 1985. Word for Mac was the first graphical version of Microsoft Word. Despite its bugginess, it became one of the most popular Mac applications.

====Excel====
{{Main|Microsoft Excel}}

[[Microsoft Excel]] is a [[spreadsheet]] program that originally competed with the dominant [[Lotus 1-2-3]], but eventually outsold it. It is available for the Windows and Mac platforms. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Mac in 1985, and the first Windows version (numbered 2.05 to line up with the Mac and bundled with a standalone Windows run-time environment) in November 1987.

====Outlook/Entourage====
{{Main|Microsoft Outlook|Microsoft Entourage}}

[[Microsoft Outlook]] (not to be confused with [[Microsoft Outlook Express|Outlook Express]]) is a [[personal information manager]] and [[e-mail]] communication software. The replacement for [[Windows Messaging]], [[Microsoft Mail]] and [[Schedule+]] starting in Office 97, it includes an e-mail client, calendar, task manager and address book.

On the Mac, Microsoft offered several versions of Outlook in the late 1990s, but only for use with [[Microsoft Exchange Server]]. In Office 2001, it introduced an alternative application with a slightly different feature set called [[Microsoft Entourage]]. It reintroduced Outlook in Office 2011, replacing Entourage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Fried | first=Ina | title=Next Mac Office, due by 2010's end, gets Outlook | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10308997-56.html | work=CNET News| date=2009-08-13 | accessdate= 2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PowerPoint====
{{Main|Microsoft PowerPoint}}

[[Microsoft PowerPoint]] is a popular [[presentation program]] for Windows and Mac. It is used to create [[slideshows]], composed of text, graphics, movies and other objects, which can be displayed on-screen and navigated through by the presenter or printed out on [[transparency (projection)|transparencies]] or [[Presentation slide|slides]].

==Common features==
Most versions of Microsoft Office (including Office 97 and later) use their own [[widget toolkit|widget]] set and do not exactly match the native operating system. This is most apparent in Microsoft Office XP and 2003, where the standard menus were replaced with a colored flat looking, shadowed menu style. The user interface of a particular version of Microsoft Office often heavily influences a subsequent version of Microsoft Windows. For example, the toolbar, colored buttons and the gray-colored '3D' look of Office 4.3 were added to Windows 95. The Ribbon, introduced in Office 2007, has been incorporated into several applications bundled with Windows 7.

Users of Microsoft Office may access external data via connection-specifications saved in &quot;Office Data Connection&quot; (.odc) files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeMarco|first=Jim|authorlink=|title=Pro Excel 2007 VBA|date=2008-02-01|publisher=Apress|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-1-59059-957-0|page=361|quote= External data is accessed through a connection file, such as an Office Data Connection (ODC) file (.odc)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Windows and Office use ''Service Packs'' to update software, Office used to release non-cumulative ''Service Releases'', which were discontinued after Office 2000 Service Release 1.

Programs in past versions of Office [[Easter eggs in Microsoft products|often contained]] substantial [[easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]]. For example, Excel 97 contained a reasonably functional flight-simulator. Versions '''starting with''' Office XP have not contained any easter eggs in the name of [[Trustworthy Computing]].

==File formats and metadata==
Microsoft Office prior to Office 2007 used proprietary file formats. This forced users who share data to adopt the same software platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html | title=We Can Put an End to Word Attachments | last=Stallman | first = Richard M. | publisher=Free Software Foundation | date=2002, 2007 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Microsoft made the entire documentation for the binary Office formats freely available for download and granted any possible patents rights for use or implementations of those binary format for free under the [[Microsoft Open Specification Promise|Open Specification Promise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/interop/docs/OfficeBinaryFormats.mspx | title=Microsoft Office Binary (doc, xls, ppt) File Formats documentation | publisher=Microsoft | date=February 15, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Microsoft had supplied such documentation freely but only on request.

Starting with Office 2007, the default file format has been a version of [[Office Open XML]], though different than the one standardized and published by [[Ecma International]] and by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[IEC]]. Microsoft has granted patent rights to the formats technology under the Open Specification Promise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/ | title=Microsoft Open Specification Promise | publisher= Microsoft | date=February 1, 2007 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has made available free downloadable converters for previous versions of Microsoft Office including Office 2003, Office XP, Office 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=941B3470-3AE9-4AEE-8F43-C6BB74CD1466&amp;displaylang=en | title=Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint File Formats | work=Microsoft Download Center | date=January 6, 2010 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Office 2004 for the Mac. Third-party implementations of Office Open XML exist on the Mac platform ([[iWork]] '08) and [[Linux]] ([[OpenOffice.org]] 3.0). In addition, Service Pack 2 for Office 2007 supports the [[OpenDocument]] Format (ODF) for opening and saving documents.

Microsoft provides the ability to [[metadata removal tool|remove metadata]] from Office documents. This was in response to highly publicized incidents where sensitive data about a document was leaked via its metadata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/02/02/microsoft_releases_metadata_removal_tool/ | title=Microsoft releases metadata removal tool | first=Jan | last=Libbenga | work=The Register | date=February 2, 2004 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metadata removal was first available in 2004, when Microsoft released a tool called ''Remove Hidden Data Add-in for Office 2003/XP'' for this purpose&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=144E54ED-D43E-42CA-BC7B-5446D34E5360&amp;displaylang=en | title=Microsoft Download Center: Office 2003/XP Add-in: Remove Hidden Data | publisher=Microsoft | date=July 8, 2008 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directly integrated into Office 2007 in a feature called the ''Document Inspector''.

==Extensibility==
A major feature of the Office suite is the ability for users and third party companies to write add-ins ([[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]) that extend the capabilities of an application by adding custom commands and specialized features. The type of add-ins supported differ by Office versions:
*Office 97 onwards (standard Windows [[Dynamic link library|DLLs]] i.e. Word WLLs and Excel XLLs)
*Office 2000 onwards ([[Component Object Model|COM]] add-ins)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://support.microsoft.com/kb/238228/en-us/ | title=How to build an Office 2000 COM add-in in Visual Basic | publisher=Microsoft | date=January 24, 2007 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Office XP onwards ([[OLE Automation|COM/OLE Automation]] add-ins)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://support.microsoft.com/kb/285337/ | title=How To Create a Visual Basic Automation Add-in for Excel Worksheet Functions | publisher=Microsoft | date=January 29, 2007 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Office 2003 onwards (Managed code add-ins - [[Visual Studio Tools for Office|VSTO solutions]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/840585/en-us/ | title=Information about designing Office add-ins by using the .NET Framework | publisher=Microsoft | date=April 5, 2010 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supported operating systems==
Microsoft supports Office for the Windows and Mac platforms. Beginning with Mac Office 4.2, the Mac and Windows versions of Office share the same file format. Consequently, any Mac with Office 4.2 or later can read documents created with Office 4.2 for Windows or later, and vice-versa. [[Visual Basic for Applications]] support was dropped in Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.macworld.com/news/2006/08/07/msuniversal/|date=2006-08-07|work=Macworld|title=WWDC: Microsoft updates Universal status of Mac apps|accessdate= 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was restored in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;macworld_office_2011&quot;/&gt;

There were efforts in the mid 1990s to port Office to RISC processors such as [[NEC]] / [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] and [[IBM]] / [[PowerPC]], but they met problems such as memory access being hampered by [[data structure alignment]] requirements. Microsoft Word 97 and Excel 97 however did ship for the [[DEC Alpha]] platform. Difficulties in porting Office may have been a factor in discontinuing [[Windows NT]] on non-Intel platforms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There is no mention of support for other operating systems, although [[Microsoft Office Mobile]], which supports the more popular features of Microsoft Office, is available for [[Windows Mobile]] and is planned to soon be available for [[Symbian OS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/170080/microsoft_nokia_team_to_put_office_apps_on_mobile_phones.html|title =Microsoft, Nokia Team to Put Office Apps on Mobile Phones |author=Montalbano, Elizabeth |date= 2009-08-12 |work=PC World |agency=IDG News | accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CrossOver]], a Windows compatibility layer by [[CodeWeavers]], makes it possible to run Microsoft Office on the Linux platform. Doing so, however, requires a license for Microsoft Office for Windows, as well as a license for CrossOver.

==Support lifecycle==
===Version compatibility===
Beginning in 3/02/89{{Citation needed|date=May 2011|reason=That can not be right. Dunno what the actual date was though}} , Microsoft instituted a new support lifecycle policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifeoffice | title=Office Family Product Support Lifecycle FAQ | publisher=Microsoft | date=July 30, 2009 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://support.microsoft.com/gp/lifepolicy | title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ | publisher=Microsoft | date=July 23, 2010 | accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions earlier than Office 2003 are no longer supported. For current and future versions of Office mainstream support will end five years after release, or two years after the next release, whichever time is later, and extended support will end five years after that.

===Discontinued applications and features===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
{{See also|Category:Discontinued Microsoft software}}
