In the third series Sam and Paul only appeared in the last episode due to Lee Ross's work on Eastenders as Owen.
*'''[[Lauren Cooper]]''' is an [[argumentative]] and [[Laziness|lazy]] teenage girl who gets out of awkward situations by repeating her catchphrase, &quot;Am I bovered?&quot; or &quot;Look at my face, is my face bovvered?

''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved 1 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}
*'''[[The Catherine Tate Show characters#Kate and Ellen|Kate and Ellen]]''' are two office workers who sit next to each other. While Ellen (played by [[Ella Kenion]]) is usually keen to get on with her work, she is frequently disturbed by Kate (Tate), who asks her to guess answers to questions and when she answers wrongly she gets mad - however it is common that she will then get it right and Tate will just say &quot;...Yeah&quot; and get back to her work.
*'''[[The Catherine Tate Show characters#The Aga Saga Woman|The Aga Saga Woman]]''' is an [[upper middle class]] English woman who goes into a state of shock in various, seemingly harmless situations when confronted with people, places, or products, which are lower than her own [[Social Class]].
*'''[[The Catherine Tate Show characters#Derek Faye|Derek Faye]]''' is a man who shows several signs of being [[homosexual|gay]] but seems to be in denial about his sexuality and becomes extremely offended and defensive when people assume he is gay, often exclaiming, &quot;How very dare you!&quot; or &quot;What? Gay, dear? Who, dear? Me dear? No, dear&quot;.
*'''[[The Catherine Tate Show characters#Janice and Ray|Janice and Ray]]''' are a couple from [[Beverley]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]] who express their disgust at the various signs of multi-culturalism in their very British circle. Sources of outrage include restaurant meals, due to their perception of over-pricing or the exotic nature of the food such as grapes in a [[Brie (cheese)|brie]] cheese sandwich.

*'''[[The Catherine Tate Show characters#Ally|Ally]]''' is a tactless woman with good intentions who unfortunately is a perfect example of someone with foot-in-mouth syndrome. Unwittingly she offends all that she comes into contact with at parties, and then in an attempt to dig herself out of the ditch she has created, only worsens the situation.
*'''[[The Catherine Tate Show characters#Bernie|Bernie]]''' is a vulgar nurse with an infectious snort, who works at a hospital who is never shy from both saying it how it is, and from airing her personal problems or feelings with everyone and anyone, particularly the male doctors.

When she makes an appearance in the [[The Queen Victoria|Queen Vic]], Peggy finds herself getting increasingly frustrated with Lauren, who asks, &quot;Are you a [[Cockney]]? Are you a Cockney sparrow?&quot; (pronounced 'Cock-er-ney') and &quot;Do you know [[Chas &amp; Dave]]? Are you their mum?&quot; repeatedly. Peggy also unintentionally uses some of Lauren's catchphrases, such as &quot;Are you disrespecting my family?&quot; and &quot;Are you calling me a [[pikey]]?&quot; Lauren eventually leaves the pub after mixing some famous lines from the soap, including &quot;Hello princess&quot; and &quot;Rickaay!&quot; with her usual catchphrase, &quot;Bovvered?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_4450000/newsid_4452400/bb_rm_4452426.stm Catherine Tate appears in Walford]&quot;.

In the BBC's [[Sport Relief]], Tate created a sketch as &quot;Nan&quot;, commenting on the 1966 world cup win and the comments of [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]]. The sketch involves &quot;Nan&quot; and her grandson watching a [[David Beckham]] football game, where she expresses her disgust at the objective of football by exclaiming &quot;What a load of old shit!&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

During his time as prime minister, [[Tony Blair]] made a [[cameo appearance]] in a sketch which features Lauren Cooper on work experience at [[10 Downing Street]].
