'''Peru''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Peru.ogg|p|É|Ë|r|uË}} ({{lang-es|PerÃº}}; {{lang-qu|PerÃº}};&lt;ref&gt;Quechua name used by government of Peru is ''PerÃº'' (see Quechua language version of Peru Parliament [http://www.congreso.gob.pe/_quechua/index.htm website] and Quechua language version of Peru Constitution [http://www.congreso.gob.pe/_quechua/Constitucion.pdf]), but common Quechua name is ''Piruw''&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ay|Piruw}}), officially the '''Republic of Peru''' ({{lang-es|RepÃºblica del PerÃº}}, {{IPA-es|reËpuÎ²lika Ã°el peËÉ¾u|pron|Es - RepÃºblica del PerÃº.ogg}}), is a country in western [[South America]]. It is bordered on the north by [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]], on the east by [[Brazil]], on the southeast by [[Bolivia]], on the south by [[Chile]], and on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]].

Peruvian territory was home to [[Ancient Peru|ancient cultures]], spanning from the [[Norte Chico civilization]], one of the oldest in the world, to the [[Inca Empire]], the largest state in [[Pre-Columbian|Pre-Columbian America]]. The [[Spanish Empire]] conquered the region in the 16th century and [[Viceroyalty of Peru|established a Viceroyalty]], which included most of its South American colonies. After [[Independence of Peru|achieving independence]] in 1821, Peru has undergone periods of political unrest and [[fiscal crisis]] as well as periods of stability and economic upswing.

Peru is a [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic divided into [[Administrative divisions of Peru|25 regions]]. Its geography varies from the arid plains of the Pacific coast to the peaks of the [[Andes]] Mountains and the tropical forests of the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is a [[developing country]] with a high [[Human Development Index]] score and a poverty level around 31%. Its main economic activities include agriculture, fishing, mining, and manufacturing of products such as textiles.

The Peruvian population, estimated at 29.5&amp;nbsp;million, is [[Multiethnic society|multiethnic]], including [[Indigenous Peoples in Peru|Amerindians]], [[White Latin American|Europeans]], [[African Latin American|Africans]], and [[Asian Latin American|Asians]]. The main spoken language is Spanish, although a significant number of Peruvians speak [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] or other [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|native languages]]. This mixture of cultural traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.

== Etymology ==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The word ''Peru'' is derived from ''BirÃº'', the name of a local ruler who lived near the [[Bay of San Miguel]], Panama, in the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;RaÃºl Porras Barrenechea, ''El nombre del PerÃº'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; When his possessions were visited by Spanish explorers in 1522, they were the southernmost part of the [[New World]] yet known to Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;RaÃºl Porras Barrenechea, ''El nombre del PerÃº'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when [[Francisco Pizarro]] explored the regions farther south, they came to be designated BirÃº or Peru.&lt;ref&gt;RaÃºl Porras Barrenechea, ''El nombre del PerÃº'', p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Crown]] gave the name legal status with the 1529 ''[[Francisco Pizarro#CapitulaciÃ³n de Toledo|CapitulaciÃ³n de Toledo]]'', which designated the newly encountered [[Inca Empire]] as the province of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;RaÃºl Porras Barrenechea, ''El nombre del PerÃº'', p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Spanish rule, the country adopted the denomination Viceroyalty of Peru, which became Republic of Peru after the [[Peruvian War of Independence]].

== History ==
{{main|History of Peru}}
The earliest evidences of human presence in Peruvian territory have been dated to approximately 9,000 years [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay et al, &quot;The first settlers&quot;, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known complex society in Peru, the [[Norte Chico civilization]], flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3,000 and 1,800 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Haas et al, &quot;Dating the Late Archaic occupation of the Norte Chico region in Peru&quot;, p. 1021.&lt;/ref&gt; These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures such as [[Cupisnique]], [[ChavÃ­n culture|Chavin]], [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Mochica Culture|Mochica]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], [[Huari Culture|Wari]], and [[ChimÃº culture|ChimÃº]]. In the 15th century, the [[Incas]] emerged as a powerful state which, in the span of a century, formed the [[Inca empire|largest empire]] in [[pre-Columbian America]].&lt;ref&gt;Terence D'Altroy, ''The Incas'', pp. 2â3.&lt;/ref&gt; Andean societies were based on agriculture, using techniques such as [[irrigation]] and [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]]; [[camelid]] husbandry and fishing were also important. Organization relied on [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and [[redistribution (cultural anthropology)|redistribution]] because these societies had no notion of market or money.&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Mayer, ''The articulated peasant'', pp. 47â68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1532, a group of ''[[conquistador]]s'' led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] defeated and captured Inca Emperor [[Atahualpa]]. Ten years later, the Spanish Crown established the Viceroyalty of Peru, which included most of its South American colonies.&lt;ref&gt;''RecopilaciÃ³n de leyes de los Reynos de las Indias'', vol. II, pp. 12â13.&lt;/ref&gt; Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] reorganized the country in the 1570s with silver mining as its main economic activity and [[Amerindian]] [[Mita (Inca)|forced labor]] as its primary workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bakewell, ''Miners of the Red Mountain'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Peruvian [[bullion]] provided revenue for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Margarita SuÃ¡rez, ''DesafÃ­os transatlÃ¡nticos'', pp. 252â253.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Andrien, ''Crisis and decline'', pp. 200â202.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Crown enacted the [[Bourbon Reforms]], a series of edicts that increased taxes and partitioned the Viceroyalty of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Burkholder, ''From impotence to authority'', pp. 83â87.&lt;/ref&gt; The new laws provoked [[TÃºpac Amaru II]]'s rebellion and other revolts, all of which were defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Scarlett O'Phelan, ''Rebellions and revolts in eighteenth century Peru and Upper Peru'', p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, while most of South America was swept by [[South American wars of independence|wars of independence]], Peru remained a [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist]] stronghold. As the elite hesitated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, [[independence of Peru|independence]] was achieved only after the military campaigns of [[JosÃ© de San MartÃ­n]] and [[SimÃ³n BolÃ­var]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anna, ''The fall of the royal government in Peru'', pp. 237â238.&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of the Republic, endemic struggles for power between military leaders caused political instability.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Walker, ''Smoldering ashes'', pp. 124â125.&lt;/ref&gt; National identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a [[Congress of Panama|Latin American Confederation]] floundered and a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation|union with Bolivia]] proved ephemeral.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gootenberg, ''Between silver and guano'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1840s and 1860s, Peru enjoyed [[Guano Era (Peru)|a period of stability]] under the presidency of [[RamÃ³n Castilla]] through increased state revenues from [[guano]] exports.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gootenberg, ''Imagining development'', pp. 5â6.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1870s, these resources had been squandered, the country was heavily indebted, and political in-fighting was again on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gootenberg, ''Imagining development'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Independencia del PerÃº.jpg|thumb|left|Independence was proclaimed by [[JosÃ© de San MartÃ­n]] in 1821.]]
Peru was defeated by Chile in the 1879â1883 [[War of the Pacific]], losing the provinces of [[Arica Province|Arica]] and [[TarapacÃ¡ Region|TarapacÃ¡]] in the treaties of [[Treaty of AncÃ³n|AncÃ³n]] and [[Treaty of Lima|Lima]]. Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the [[Civilista Party]], which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of [[Augusto B. LeguÃ­a]].&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich MÃ¼cke, ''Political culture in nineteenth-century Peru'', pp. 193â194.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Depression]] caused the downfall of LeguÃ­a, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA).&lt;ref&gt;Peter KlarÃ©n, ''Peru'', pp. 262â276.&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades.&lt;ref&gt;David Palmer, ''Peru: the authoritarian tradition'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], staged a coup against president [[Fernando BelaÃºnde Terry|Fernando Belaunde]]. The new regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development but failed to gain widespread support.&lt;ref&gt;George Philip, ''The rise and fall of the Peruvian military radicals'', pp. 163â165.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, General [[Francisco Morales BermÃºdez]] forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Schydlowsky and Juan Julio Wicht, &quot;Anatomy of an economic failure&quot;, pp. 106â107.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Peru faced a considerable external debt, ever-growing inflation, a surge in drug trafficking, and [[Internal conflict in Peru|massive political violence]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter KlarÃ©n, ''Peru'', pp. 406â407.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the presidency of [[Alberto Fujimori]] (1990â2000), the country started to recover; however, accusations of authoritarianism, corruption, and human rights violations forced his resignation after the controversial [[Peruvian general election, 2000|2000 elections]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1031752.stm Fujimori: Decline and fall]''.

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Peru}}
Peru covers {{convert|1285216|kmÂ²|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It borders Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The [[Andes]] Mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean; they define the three regions traditionally used to describe the country geographically. The ''costa'' (coast), to the west, is a narrow plain, largely arid except for valleys created by seasonal rivers. The ''sierra'' (highlands) is the region of the Andes; it includes the ''[[Altiplano]]'' plateau as well as the highest peak of the country, the {{convert|6768|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[HuascarÃ¡n]].&lt;ref&gt;AndesHandbook, [http://www.andeshandbook.cl/eng/default.asp?main=cerro.asp?codigo=54 ''HuascarÃ¡n'']. Retrieved August 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The third region is the ''selva'' (jungle), a wide expanse of flat terrain covered by the [[Amazon rainforest]] that extends east. Almost 60% of the country's area is located within this region.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto de Estudios HistÃ³ricoâMarÃ­timos del PerÃº, ''El PerÃº y sus recursos: Atlas geogrÃ¡fico y econÃ³mico'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Imageframe|width=390|content=[[File:Alpamayo.jpg|184px]] [[File:Manu riverbank.jpg|200px]]|caption=''Left'': [[Alpamayo]], a mountain peak in the [[HuascarÃ¡n National Park]].&lt;br /&gt;''Right'': [[ManÃº National Park]], a [[biosphere reserve]], depicts the Peruvian rainforest.|align=right}}
Most Peruvian rivers originate in the peaks of the Andes and drain into one of three [[drainage basin|basins]]. Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short, flowing only intermittently. Tributaries of the [[Amazon River]] are longer, have a much larger flow, and are less steep once they exit the ''sierra''. Rivers that drain into [[Lake Titicaca]] are generally short and have a large flow.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto de Estudios HistÃ³ricoâMarÃ­timos del PerÃº, ''El PerÃº y sus recursos: Atlas geogrÃ¡fico y econÃ³mico'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Peru's longest rivers are the [[Ucayali]], the [[MaraÃ±Ã³n River (Peru)|MaraÃ±Ã³n]], the [[IÃ§Ã¡|Putumayo]], the [[YavarÃ­ River|YavarÃ­]], the [[Huallaga River|Huallaga]], the [[Urubamba River|Urubamba]], the [[Mantaro River|Mantaro]], and the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica e InformÃ¡tica, ''PerÃº: Compendio EstadÃ­stico 2005'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peru, unlike other [[equator]]ial countries, does not have an exclusively tropical climate; the influence of the Andes and the [[Humboldt Current]] cause great climatic diversity within the country. The ''costa'' has moderate temperatures, low precipitations, and high humidity, except for its warmer, wetter northern reaches.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto de Estudios HistÃ³ricoâMarÃ­timos del PerÃº, ''El PerÃº y sus recursos: Atlas geogrÃ¡fico y econÃ³mico'', pp. 24â25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''sierra'', rain is frequent during summer, and temperature and humidity diminish with altitude up to the frozen peaks of the Andes.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto de Estudios HistÃ³ricoâMarÃ­timos del PerÃº, ''El PerÃº y sus recursos: Atlas geogrÃ¡fico y econÃ³mico'', pp. 25â26.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''selva'' is characterized by heavy rainfall and high temperatures, except for its southernmost part, which has cold winters and seasonal rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto de Estudios HistÃ³ricoâMarÃ­timos del PerÃº, ''El PerÃº y sus recursos: Atlas geogrÃ¡fico y econÃ³mico'', pp. 26â27.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its varied geography and climate, Peru has a high biodiversity with 21,462 species of plants and animals reported as of 2003; 5,855 of them [[endemism|endemic]].&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica e InformÃ¡tica, ''PerÃº: Compendio EstadÃ­stico 2005'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peruvian economic policy has varied widely over the past decades. The 1968â1975 government of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] introduced radical reforms, which included [[agrarian reform]], the expropriation of foreign companies, the introduction of an [[economic interventionism|economic planning system]], and the creation of a large state-owned sector. These measures failed to achieve their objectives of [[income redistribution]] and the end of [[dependency theory|economic dependence on developed nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Thorp and Geoffrey Bertram, ''Peru 1890â1977'', pp. 318â319.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these results, most reforms were not reversed until the 1990s, when the [[liberalization|liberalizing]] government of [[Alberto Fujimori]] ended [[price controls]], [[protectionism]], restrictions on [[foreign direct investment]], and most state ownership of companies.&lt;ref&gt;John Sheahan, ''Searching for a better society'', p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Reforms have permitted sustained economic growth since 1993, except for a slump after the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Banco Central de Reserva, [http://www.bcrp.gob.pe/docs/Estadisticas/Cuadros-Anuales/ACuadro_06.xls ''Producto bruto interno por sectores productivos 1951â2006''].

{{main|Demographics of Peru}}
Peru is a [[Multiethnic society|multiethnic country]] formed by different groups over five centuries. [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|Amerindians]] inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|the Spanish Conquest]] of the 16th century; according to historian David N. Cook their population decreased from nearly 5â9&amp;nbsp;million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of [[infectious disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520â1620'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spaniards]] and [[Black people|Africans]] arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and indigenous peoples. Gradual [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigration from England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain followed independence.&lt;ref&gt;Mario VÃ¡zquez, &quot;Immigration and mestizaje in nineteenth-century Peru&quot;, pp. 79â81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] arrived in the 1850s, replacing slave workers, and have since greatly influenced Peruvian society.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus MÃ¶rner, ''Race mixture in the history of Latin America'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With about 29.5&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants, Peru is the [[List of South American countries by population|fourth most populous country in South America]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, {{PDFlink|[http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2006/WPP2006_Highlights_rev.pdf ''World Population Prospects'']|2.74&amp;nbsp;MB}}, pp. 44â48. Retrieved July 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Its demographic growth rate declined from 2.6% to 1.6% between 1950 and 2000; population is expected to reach approximately 42 million in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica e InformÃ¡tica, ''PerÃº: Estimaciones y Proyecciones de PoblaciÃ³n, 1950â2050'', pp. 37â38, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, 75.9% lived in urban areas and 24.1% in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica e InformÃ¡tica, ''Perfil sociodemogrÃ¡fico del PerÃº'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Major cities include [[Lima]] (home to over 8 million people), [[Arequipa]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]], [[Piura]], [[Iquitos]], [[Cusco]], [[Chimbote]], and [[Huancayo]]; all reported more than 250,000 inhabitants in the [[Peru 2007 Census|2007 census]].&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica e InformÃ¡tica, ''Perfil sociodemogrÃ¡fico del PerÃº'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Spanish, the first language of 83.9% of Peruvians aged five and older in 2007, is the primary language of the country. It coexists with several indigenous languages, the most common of which is [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], spoken by 13.2% of the population. Other native and foreign languages were spoken at that time by 2.7% and 0.1% of Peruvians, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica e InformÃ¡tica, ''Perfil sociodemogrÃ¡fico del PerÃº'', p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 census, 81.3% of the population over 12 years old described themselves as Catholic, 12.5% as [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]], 3.3% as of other denominations, and 2.9% as non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica e InformÃ¡tica, ''Perfil sociodemogrÃ¡fico del PerÃº'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy was estimated at 92.9% in 2007; this rate is lower in rural areas (80.3%) than in urban areas (96.3%).&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica e InformÃ¡tica, ''Perfil sociodemogrÃ¡fico del PerÃº'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Primary and secondary education are [[compulsory education|compulsory]] and free in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;''ConstituciÃ³n PolÃ­tica del PerÃº'', Article NÂ° 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
{{main|Culture of Peru}}
[[File:CuzqueÃ±a2.jpg|upright|thumb|Anonymous [[Cuzco School]] painting, 18th century]]
Peruvian culture is primarily rooted in [[Amerindian]] and Spanish traditions,&lt;ref&gt;VÃ­ctor AndrÃ©s Belaunde, ''Peruanidad'', p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; though it has also been influenced by various African, Asian, and European ethnic groups. [[Peruvian arts|Peruvian artistic traditions]] date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of [[Pre-Inca cultures]]. The Incas maintained these crafts and made [[Architecture of Peru|architectural]] achievements including the construction of [[Machu Picchu]]. [[Baroque]] dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Gauvin Alexander Bailey, ''Art of colonial Latin America'', pp. 72â74.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the [[Cuzco School]] are representative.&lt;ref&gt;Gauvin Alexander Bailey, ''Art of colonial Latin America'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of ''[[Indigenismo]]'' in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Latin American art of the 20th century'', pp. 76â77, 145â146.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.&lt;ref&gt;DamiÃ¡n BayÃ³n, &quot;Art, c. 1920âc. 1980&quot;, pp. 425â428.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peruvian literature]] is rooted in the oral traditions of [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included [[chronicle]]s and [[Christian literature|religious literature]]. After independence, [[Costumbrism]] and [[Romanticism]] became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of [[Ricardo Palma]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Martin, &quot;Literature, music and the visual arts, c. 1820â1870&quot;, pp. 37â39.&lt;/ref&gt; The early 20th century's ''Indigenismo'' movement was led by such writers as [[Ciro AlegrÃ­a]]&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Martin, &quot;Narrative since c. 1920&quot;, pp. 151â152.&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[JosÃ© MarÃ­a Arguedas]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Martin, &quot;Narrative since c. 1920&quot;, pp. 178â179.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CÃ©sar Vallejo]] wrote modernist and often politically engaged verse. Modern Peruvian literature is recognized thanks to authors such as [[List of Nobel laureates in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], a leading member of the [[Latin American Boom]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Martin, &quot;Narrative since c. 1920&quot;, pp. 186â188.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ceviche de pulpo.jpg|thumb|left|''Ceviche'' is a lime marinated seafood dish.]]
[[Peruvian cuisine]] blends [[Native American cuisine#Native American cuisine of South America|Amerindian]] and [[Spanish food]] with strong influences from African, Arab, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Custer, ''The Art of Peruvian Cuisine'', pp. 17â22.&lt;/ref&gt; Common dishes include ''[[anticuchos]]'', ''[[ceviche]]'', and ''[[pachamanca]]''. Peru's varied climate allows the growth of diverse plants and animals good for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Custer, ''The Art of Peruvian Cuisine'', pp. 25â38.&lt;/ref&gt; Peru's diversity of ingredients and cooking techniques is receiving worldwide acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Embassy of Peru in the United States, [http://www.peruvianembassy.us/do.php?p=507 ''The Peruvian Gastronomy''].

[[Peruvian music]] has Andean, Spanish, and African roots.&lt;ref&gt;RaÃºl Romero, &quot;Andean Peru&quot;, p. 385â386.&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely in each region; the ''[[quena]]'' and the ''[[tinya]]'' were two common instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Dale Olsen, ''Music of El Dorado'', pp. 17â22.&lt;/ref&gt; Spaniards introduced new instruments, such as the guitar and the harp, which led to the development of crossbred instruments like the ''[[charango]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Turino, &quot;Charango&quot;, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the ''[[Cajon|cajÃ³n]]'', a percussion instrument.&lt;ref&gt;RaÃºl Romero, &quot;La mÃºsica tradicional y popular&quot;, pp. 263â265.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peruvian folk dances]] include ''[[marinera]]'', ''[[tondero]]'', ''[[zamacueca]]'', and ''[[huayno]]''.&lt;ref&gt;RaÃºl Romero, &quot;La mÃºsica tradicional y popular&quot;, pp. 243â245, 261â263.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}
