'''Hunter Tylo''' (born '''Deborah Jo Hunter''', July 3, 1962) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]], [[Author]] and former [[model (person)|model]]. She is best known for her role as [[Taylor Hayes (fictional character)|Taylor Hayes]] on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]''. She originated the role in 1990, and still continues to play it today.

==Early life==
Tylo was born '''Deborah Jo Hunter''' in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], the daughter of Jo Anne and Morris Jabez Hunter. She is of Cherokee Native American descent on her mother's side. She has an older sister named Elizabeth and a younger brother named Cliff. Tylo has been credited as '''Deborah Morehart'''; Morehart was the last name of her first husband.

==Professional career==
In 1984, credited as Deborah Morehart, Tylo appeared in the sorority [[slasher film]] ''The Initiation'' with future ''[[Melrose Place (1992 TV series)|Melrose Place]]'' actor [[Daphne Zuniga]].

Tylo subsequently became well known after playing regular roles in US daytime [[soap opera]]s.

Her television debut was on ''[[All My Children]]'' in [[1985 in television|1985]]. She met her future husband [[Michael Tylo]] on the set playing his love interest. She left the show and married Tylo in 1987. She played [[Marina Toscano]] on ''[[Days of our Lives]]'' from [[1989 in television|1989]] to [[1990 in television|1990]].

Tylo played the role of [[Taylor Hayes Forrester|Dr. Taylor Hayes Forrester]] as a series regular on ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' from [[1990 in television|1990]] through [[2002 in television|2002]]. She returned to the show in [[2004 in television|2004]] for a two-episode appearance as a vision. In May 2005, she returned as a series regular.
She also acted in the American movie [[Down and Derby]] in 2005.

==''Melrose Place'' controversy==
In 1996, Tylo was cast in ''[[Melrose Place (1992 TV series)|Melrose Place]]'' and opted to leave ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' to take the role. However, she was fired by ''Melrose Place'' producer [[Aaron Spelling]] prior to filming any episodes for the series, when she announced she was pregnant.

The character she was to play, Taylor McBride, was recast with [[Lisa Rinna]] taking the role. Tylo quickly returned to ''The Bold and the Beautiful''. Tylo sued Spelling on grounds of discrimination for being pregnant and won $4.8 million from a Los Angeles jury.  Spelling argued that Tylo's pregnancy rendered her unable to play the character, who was supposed to be a sexy seductress.  During the trial Tylo published pictures of herself while pregnant which showed that she retained a slim figure.

Prior to trial, during the [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] phase of the [[litigation]], Spelling's lawyers were partially successful in an interlocutory appeal that forced Tylo to answer questions in her deposition about her pregnancy (and her husband's ability to get her pregnant).&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source

 |other_source1=ceb.com
|other_url1=http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/55CA4t1379.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case is widely recognized as an important one in establishing the right of actresses to continue to work while pregnant.

==Personal life==
Tylo's first marriage was to Tom Moreheart; they had a son, Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Morehart.

In 1987, she married [[Michael Tylo]], with whom she had daughters Izabella Gabrielle and Katya Ariel Tylo and son Michael Tylo, Jr. The marriage ended in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soapcentral.com/bb/news/2005/1114-tylo_divorce.php Hunter, Michael Tylo Ending 18 Years of Marriage] Soap Central, November 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, her infant daughter Katya was diagnosed with a rare cancer of the eye called [[retinoblastoma]]. Doctors removed the affected right eye and began [[chemotherapy]]. Later in the year a tumor was detected in Katya's other eye; that tumor inexplicably disappeared. Katya recovered and wears a prosthetic right eye.

In 2001, she wrote her autobiography, &quot;Making a Miracle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huntertylo.ws/HuntersCC/experience/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2007, Tylo's 19-year old son, Michael Tylo, Jr., drowned in the family pool in [[Henderson, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray| first=Mark|last=Nudd| first=Tim| title=Actress Hunter Tylo's Son Drowns | publisher = People.com | date =2007-10-19 | url =http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20153313,00.htm | accessdate =2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] coroner concluded that &quot;the cause of death was drowning due to seizure disorder,&quot; and the death was ruled [[accident]]al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hancock| first=Noelle| title=Hunter Tylo's Son Dies in Accidental Drowning   | publisher = Usmagazine.com | date =2007-10-19 | url =http://www.usmagazine.com/hunter_tylo | accessdate =2007-10-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071021111522/http://usmagazine.com/hunter_tylo &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Tylo filed a restraining order against boyfriend Corey Cofield, claiming that he had acted violently towards her and her children; she asked for the order to be withdrawn in October 2008, telling a judge that Cofield was attending therapy and was much better.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2009/03/12/hunter-tylo-forgives-and-forgets/ Hunter Tylo Forgives and Forgets] TMZ, March 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
