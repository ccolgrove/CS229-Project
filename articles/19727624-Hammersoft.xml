&quot;'''Western Ford Gateway'''&quot; is a song by [[Elton John]] with lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]]. It is the third track off his first album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''.

==Musical structure==
It opens with a bluesy guitar riff before segueing into the main [[hammond organ]]-oriented verse. It is one the few John songs to do so, overlapping his usual piano. The sound quality is one of the poorest from the record, with the lead vocal being just about audible in the left channel. In the chorus, the vocal is [[Doubletracking|doubletracked]] and the vocal is then loud. It is a relatively short song, clocking at 3:16.

==Lyrical meaning==
It was the first song released by John that Taupin had written about America. An America he yet hadn't witnessed first-hand. It has only 18 lines, making it one of the shortest lyrics the duo released, and deals with matters such as [[pollution]] and [[poverty]]. By the time of its release, this was what America looked like from the outside.

It has never been performed in any radio show or in concert, and is not a popular pick among fans.

==Personnel==
*Elton John - [[piano]], [[Hammond organ|organ]], vocals
*[[Caleb Quaye]] - [[Electric guitar|guitars]]
*Tony Murray - [[Bass guitar|bass]]
*Roger Pope - [[Drum kit|drums]]
