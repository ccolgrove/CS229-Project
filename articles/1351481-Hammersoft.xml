'''Indiana University South Bend''' is the third largest campus of the [[Indiana University]] system. It is popularly known as IUSB or IU South Bend. It is located in [[South Bend, Indiana]], in [[St. Joseph County, Indiana]].

==History==

Indiana University began offering classes in South Bend in 1916 as an extension of the main campus of [[Indiana University Bloomington]]. In the Depression, the superintendent of South Bend schools asked that more classes be added for those who could not afford to attend the Bloomington campus. 

The classes were offered at Central High School in downtown South Bend and within a few years enrollment reached 500. Classes were taught by local high school teachers with master's degrees and occasionally by Bloomington faculty who traveled once a week for class.

The university appointed a resident director in 1940. Lynton Keith Caldwell, then a graduate student at the University of Chicago, took on the job. 

In 1941, Ernest Gerkin was named the first permanent full-time faculty member. 

Donald Carmony became the director from 1944 to 1950, followed by Jack Detzler, who remained in the job until 1964. 

In 1961 the first IUSB building was constructed on newly acquired land on the north shore of the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|St. Joseph River]]. It was first named the IU Center. In 1962 it was renamed South Bend-Mishawaka Campus.

In 1965, Lester Wolfson was appointed director and assistant dean of the campus. Wolfson was named chancellor in 1969 and his leadership continued until his retirement in 1987. 

Four year degree programs were authorized in 1965 and the campus awarded its first degrees in 1967. Thirty-one students graduated the first year.

The name officially becomes Indiana University at South Bend or IUSB in 1968. The first master's degrees were conferred in 1970.

Enrollment exceeds 5,000 in 1971 and the addition to Northside Hall is opened in 1972. The purchased of the Associate Building (now known as the Administration Building) was completed in 1975. 

Groundbreaking for the Schurz Library was in 1986 and it is opened in 1989. Chancellor Wolfson retired in 1987 and H. Daniel Cohen was named chancellor. Cohen concentrated on improving facilities, grounds and programming. 

In 1994, the university purchased the former Playland Park, a 26.5 acre parcel on the south side of the St. Joseph River. Playland had been an amusement park, a golf course and a ballpark. 

Cohn resigned in 1995 and long time history professor Lester C. Lamon assumed the position of acting chancellor for two years until Kenneth L. Perrin was named chancellor.

During Perrin's tenure, two major projects were completed. First, Wiekamp Hall was opened in 1998. The building provided much needed classroom, computer lab and office space. And secondly, the $15.7 million Student Activities Center was constructed and completed in early 2002.

Perrin retired in 2002 and Una Mae Reck was named chancellor. Reck was formerly the vice president for academic affairs at the State University of New York at Fredonia.  

During Reck's administration a number of major projects were completed - student housing, a bridge connecting the campus to student housing across the St. Joseph River, the Elkhart Center and remodeling of the administration building.

==Campus==

IU South Bend is centered on a large green pedestrian mall located along the St. Joseph River. When the campus officially opened in the early 1960s, it featured two buildings: Northside Hall and Greenlawn Hall, a former [[tool and die]] factory. Growing steadily over the last 40 years, the campus now consists of 12 buildings, including the Franklin D. Schurz Library. A recent addition is the 100,000 square foot (9,000 mÂ²) Student Activities Center (SAC) featuring [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], and [[racquetball]] courts, a walking track, a [[physical fitness|fitness]] and [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|wellness]] center, a cafÃ©, a student lounge, and student life offices. The university also owns {{convert|26|acre|m2}} on the south bank of the St. Joseph River.

The SAC is the site for athletics, new student orientation, intramurals, fitness classes, exercising, meetings and recognition ceremonies. 

A pedestrian bridge that bears the words &quot;Indiana University South Bend&quot; connects the main campus with the athletic fields across the river. Construction on the bridge began in December 2005 and was completed in September 2006. On September 22, 2006, the Indiana University Board of Trustees voted to approve housing for IU South Bend, to be located across the river. The housing facilities, opened in the fall of 2008, consist of 400 beds in 8 apartment-style units across the river, along with a community building.

In August 2007 construction was completed on the {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Indiana University South Bend Elkhart Center in downtown [[Elkhart, Indiana]]. The university also maintains a center at [[Plymouth, Indiana]] at Plymouth High School.

As of January 1, 2008 the IUSB campus and all properties owned by the school are non-smoking areas.
