EmperorLinux was started by Lincoln Durey, an EE Ph.D. from [[Tulane University]].  The company's first product was the BlackPerl Linux laptop, based on a Sony [[VAIO]] 505TR with a highly modified Linux kernel.  Since 1999 the company has added a range of IBM [[ThinkPad]]s, Dell [[Dell Latitude|Latitudes]], and Sharp laptops to its lineup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Home&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.EmperorLinux.com/|title = EmperorLinux|accessdate = 2009-05-27|last = EmperorLinux|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Why&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.emperorlinux.com/why/|title = Why?|accessdate = 2009-05-27|last = EmperorLinux|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laptops are available with most major Linux distributions, including [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|RHEL]], [[Debian]], [[Ubuntu Linux|Ubuntu]], and [[SUSE Linux|SuSE]].  Significant improvements to stock Linux distributions come from the empkernel, and a carefully configured /etc directory.  Supported features include APM and ACPI suspend and hibernate support, CPU throttling, LCD backlight brightness control, wireless, and generally full support of the hardware under Linux.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distros&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.EmperorLinux.com/distros|title = Distros|accessdate = 2009-05-27|last = EmperorLinux|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kernel&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.EmperorLinux.com/kernel/|title = Kernel|accessdate = 2009-05-27|last = EmperorLinux|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
