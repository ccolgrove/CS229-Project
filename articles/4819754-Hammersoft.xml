WRBL replaced RTV with [[Me-TV]], a digital broadcast network owned by [[Weigel Broadcasting]] and distributed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], featuring sitcoms and dramas from the 1950s to the 1980s, which took the place of RTV on digital subchannel 3.2 on September 26, 2011, as part of a groupwide affiliation agreement with Media General; the channel replaced RTV on some Media General-owned stations in other markets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2011/09/15/54029/metv-beefs-up-roster-with-10-new-stations Me-TV Beefs Up Roster With 10 New Stations], ''TVNewsCheck'', September 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
WRBL first went on the air on November 15, 1953âjust over a month after [[NBC]] affiliate WDAK-TV (channel 28, now [[WTVM]] on channel 9).  It is Georgia's second-oldest station outside of [[Atlanta]] (after [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]]'s [[WMAZ-TV]]) as well as the second-oldest in Columbus.  It was owned by Jim Woodruff along with WRBL radio (AM 1420, now [[WRCG]], and FM 102.9, now [[WVRK]]).  Originally on channel 4, it moved to channel 3 in 1960 as part of a three-city swap which saw WTVM move to channel 9 and [[WTVY (TV)|WTVY]] in [[Dothan, Alabama]] move to channel 4.

The station has always been a CBS affiliate owing to its radio sister's long affiliation with CBS Radio, but shared [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] with WTVM until the channel switch of 1960, when WTVM switched to ABC to get in line with then co-owned [[WTVC]], also on channel 9.  At that time, WRBL began sharing NBC with WTVM.  WRBL is the only major station in Columbus that has never changed its original affiliation.  Columbus was one of the very few two-station markets in the 1960s without its own primary NBC affiliate, although NBC affiliates in [[WALB|Albany]], [[WSB-TV|Atlanta]] and [[WSFA|Montgomery]] could be picked up with relative ease.   WYEA (now [[WLTZ]]) took over the NBC affiliation when it opened in October 1970.

Woodruff owned the station until his death in a car crash in the 1970s.  After his death, banks controlled the station until it was bought by [[Malcolm Glazier]]'s Avant Corporation of [[Rochester, New York]]. He sold it to TCS Partners, who, in turn, sold it to Spartan Communications.  Spartan merged with current owner Media General in 2000.

Because half of the station's viewing area is in the [[Central Time Zone]], programming that is normally delayed an hour in this time zone is aired live, and thus, airs an hour earlier for viewers in [[Alabama]].

==News operation==
Due to economic conditions from 2008 through 2009, WRBL's owner Media General enacted a series of staff reductions that noticeably affected the amount of news that WRBL offered. First, 6 p.m. weekend newscasts were eliminated in Fall 2008, and the remaining weekend newscasts were eliminated in early 2009.  Soon after, the 5 p.m. and noon newscasts were dropped.  However, as of August 2010, the noon newscast has been added back to the WRBL lineup. On October 17, 2010, WRBL revived the Sunday night edition of News 3 Nightwatch.  Unlike the previous newscasts that were cancelled, the duties of these newscasts are spread throughout remaining staff members, including the anchor team.  On September 12, 2011, the station revived News 3 First Edition weekdays at 5 p.m.
