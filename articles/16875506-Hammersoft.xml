The Victorian '''Head of the Schoolgirls''' regatta is contested between girls schools from all across the state of [[Victoria (Australia)]]. Schools from the [[Girls Sport Victoria (GSV)]] and also [[Associated Public Schools of Victoria]] compete in a range of events over 1000m or 1500m.

The race is usually held mid-March on the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] in Geelong. The 2009 Head of the Schoolgirls Regatta will be held on the weekend of the 21st and 22nd of March 2009 and the week earlier in 2010.&lt;ref name=RV_History&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rowingvictoria.asn.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?art_id=1172&amp;nav_cat_id=420&amp;nav_top_id=92|title= History of the Head of the Schoolgirls|accessdate= 2008-04-11|work= Victorian Head of the Schoolgirls |publisher= Rowing Victoria |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080801184714/http://www.rowingvictoria.asn.au/html/s02_article/article_view.asp?art_id=1172&amp;nav_cat_id=420&amp;nav_top_id=92 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first girl to row within the A.P.S. was a lone sculler from [[Geelong Grammar School]] in 1972. There were 32 girls rowing by 1975, and in 1981, girls began competing at the Senior Regatta with Geelong Grammar School, [[The Geelong College]], [[Melbourne Girls Grammar School]], [[Morongo Girls' College]] and [[Lauriston Girls School]] racing in 1st and 2nd Fours over 800m. [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] and [[Carey Baptist Grammar School]] joined in 1982, with Carey boating a First Four in 1983.&lt;ref name=Introofgirls&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/school-rowing/vic/aps-head-of-river/index.php|title= The Introduction of the Girls Events|accessdate= 2008-03-31|last= Guerin |first= Andrew |year= 2004 |work= APS Head of the River |publisher= Guerin-Foster History of Australian Rowing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1984 was the final year that non APS school girls participated in the APS Head of the River, with seven girls' crews rowing in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Four events. The following year saw the regatta revert to an all APS event, with only Geelong Grammar and Geelong College boating a First Four. Carey reappeared in the First Fours in 1986, the same year that [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]] joined, and with Caulfield joining in 1987, all five [[co-educational]] schools were boating a first four over 1500m.&lt;ref name=Introofgirls/&gt; Around this time, the [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of the [[Morongo Girls' College]] initiated a meeting that established the Head of School Girls' Regatta (HOSG).&lt;ref name=RV_History/&gt;

===Location===
The first HOSG was held in 1985 at [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] with seven events, and 240 competitors from 16 schools. In 1987, the event moved to [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]]. Each year a different school would host the regatta, but as it grew in size and popularity (from 9 events in 1987 to 321 crews and 2009 competitors in 2005), the Head of the Schoolgirl Regatta Committee decided  to contract the event management and official duties. 2005 was the inaugural year in which Rowing Victoria both hosted the regatta and provided the officials, and has done so each year since.

===Events===
Racing at the Head of the Schoolgirls is in Eights, Fours, Quad Sculls and Single Sculls across multiple divisions and year levels. Fourth and fifth girls' crews were introduced in 1995, racing over 1000m in regulation fours and in 1999 Year 10 Fours competed. Girls first eights (1998), second eights (1999) and third eights (2008)have replaced the open fours in the last few years.&lt;ref name=GirlsSummary&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/school-rowing/vic/aps-head-of-river/girls-summary.php|title= Summary of the Girls Head of the River|accessdate= 2008-03-31|last= Guerin |first= Andrew |year= 2004 |work= APS Head of the River |publisher= Guerin-Foster History of Australian Rowing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010==
In 2010, [[Genazzano FCJ College]] dominated the regatta with 13 of their 19 crews coming first and one coming second. [[MLC]] came second with 4 wins, 1 second and 1 third. [[Loreto Mandeville Hall]] came overall third with 2 wins, 6 seconds and 4 thirds.
