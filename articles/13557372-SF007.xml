'''Recuva''' (pronounced &quot;reÂ·covÂ·ah&quot;) is a [[freeware]] [[data recovery]] program, developed by [[Piriform (company)|Piriform]], and runs under [[Microsoft Windows]] 7, Vista, XP, 2003, and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.piriform.com/recuva/introducing-recuva/system-requirements|title=System requirements - Piriform Docs|work=docs.piriform.com|accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to recover files that have been &quot;permanently&quot; [[file deletion|deleted]] and marked by the operating system as free space. The program can also be used to recover files deleted from [[USB flash drive]]s, [[memory card]]s, or [[portable media player|MP3 players]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://software-today.com/recuva|title=Recuva - free file recovery software|work=Software-Today.com|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technibble.com/repair-tool-of-the-week-recuva-portable/|title=Repair Tool of the Week: Recuva Portable|work=technibble.com|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recuva was described by vnunet.com as an &quot;effective tool for undeleting or salvaging files we sent for recycling and deleted, in the past&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/downloads/2187036/recuva|title= Recuva 1.22|work=vnunet.com|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program works on both [[FAT]] and [[NTFS]] file systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,67538-order,1-page,1/description.html|title= Recuva 1.04.104|work=PCWorld|accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is able to recover lost directory structure and automatically renames files when trying to recover two files of the same name.

As with other file recovery programs Recuva works by looking for unreferenced data, but if the operating system has written new data over a deleted file then recovery will often not be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ro.punt.nl/?a=2008-05|title=
