{{Politics of Egypt}}
By its constitution, [[Egypt]] has a [[multi-party]] system, however in practice the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]] was the long-time ruling party and dominated the Egyptian political arena up until the [[Egyptian Revolution 2011|Egyptian Revolution]] in 2011 which ousted NDP [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]]. Under Mubarak, opposition parties were allowed, but were widely considered to have no real chance of gaining power. As of February 11, 2011, the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] has governed Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/feb/11/crowds-rejoice-egypts-mubarak-steps-down/ | title=Mubarakâs resignation sparks new day for Egypt: âHeâs gone!â | publisher=The Washington Times | date=February 12 2011 | accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2011, the Council introduced the [[Political Party Law]] which eases restrictions on the legal establishment of new political parties in Egypt. The legislation has still however been criticized as discriminatory. Under the law new parties are now required to have at least 5000 members from at least ten of [[Governorates of Egypt| Egypt's provinces]]. Originally new parties were only required to have 1000 members. This would make it harder for new parties to form before parliamentary elections scheduled for September 2011.&lt;ref name=fails&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/379401 | title=Egyptâs new Political Party Law fails to please everyone | publisher=Al Masry Al Youm | date=March 29 2011 | accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; And new party leaders are required to raise at least [[Egyptian pound|LE]]1 million to publish the names of the founding members in two widely-circulated [[Daily newspaper|dailies]], seen as favoring wealthier interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/418296 | title=Egyptâs workers: Between party politics and unionization | publisher=Al Masry Al Youm | date=May 1 2011 | accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also no parties are able to form on the basis of [[religion]] or [[Social class|class]], ruling out the formation of [[Islamic party|Islamic]] and [[List of Labour Parties|labor]] parties.&lt;ref name=fails/&gt;

== History ==
Emergence of political parties in Egypt in the 20th century was a reflection of social, economic and cultural interactions as well as certain historical, national and political circumstances, leading to the creation and development of modern institutions of government administration and society, such as the parliament, cabinets, political parties, syndicates, etc. This emergence has been gradual and has gone through successive stages. Political parties have firstly been formed as secret societies that were followed by formation of political groups.

The National Party, not to be confused with the later National Democratic Party (NDP), was the first party, formed in 1907 by [[Scott Crawford]]. In less than ten years, there was a great variety in these parties; in their nature, formation, organization, power, their popular base and platforms. There were national parties, groups dominated by the royal palace, others formed by the occupation authority as well as ideological parties expressing certain ideologies.

In 1907 - 1920, the already-formed political parties in Egypt were a starting signal for the dissemination of further parties; however, they were restricted due to the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation and Egyptian subordination to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The February 1922 [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence]] and the issuance of the [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|1923 Constitution]] led to the establishment of a royal constitutional rule based on party pluralism and the principles of liberal democracy.

During 1923 - 1952, [[Egypt]] witnessed a remarkable experience rich in political and democratic practices, however, such an experience was marked with many defects such as the British occupation, foreign intervention in Egypt's affairs and the royal palace's interference in political life. With the outbreak of the July [[1952 Revolution]], the Egyptian regime worked to liquidate the opposition. In January 1953, an enactment was adopted on disbanding the political parties and adoption of the one-party rule. The enactment of the parties' law in 1977 demonstrated Egypt's political regime officially turned into the era of party pluralism.

==Political parties and groups==
&lt;!--- :''The general rule on naming applies. That means: the parties are named in the English translation and the original native name is placed on the first line of the article unless the native form is more commonly used in English than the English form. Rationale and specifics: See: [[Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English)]]''. ---&gt;

Egyptian politics are subject to unique circumstances and often defy simple classification in terms of the [[political spectrum]]. There are currently over 20 registered political parties in Egypt. Groups are sometimes associated with the political [[Left-wing politics|left]] or [[Right-wing politics|right]], especially in international circles, according to their stance on issues. While the current Egyptian constitution prohibits the formation of political parties based on religion, there are parties that seek to establish Islamic [[sharia]] laws, or uphold the article in the constitution that states that sharia law is the main source of legislation, and others that support the formation of a [[secular]] state. The following is a categorization of political parties based on their social, economical, and political orientation, as well as their legal status&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explainer: Egypt's crowded political arena|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/spotlight/egypt/2011/11/2011111510295463645.html|publisher=Al Jazeera English|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt Elections: How would you vote?
