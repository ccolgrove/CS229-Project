'''Hidalgo''' ({{IPA-es|iËÃ°alÉ£o}}) officially ''Estado Libre y Soberano de Hidalgo'' ({{lang-en|Free and Sovereign State of Hidalgo}}) is one of the 31 states which, with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided in [[Municipalities of Hidalgo|84 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Pachuca, Hidalgo|Pachuca de Soto]].

In [[1869]], [[Benito JuÃ¡rez]] created the State of Hidalgo. He appointed as [[Capital city|capital]] of the state the city of Pachuca to which was added the name ''&quot;de Soto&quot;'' in recognition of [[Manuel Fernando Soto]], who is considered the most important driving force in creating the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impreso.milenio.com/node/8606683|title=El Bicentenario serÃ¡ festejado con una biografÃ­a de Pachuca|publisher=''[[Milenio Diario|Milenio Hidalgo]]''|date=December 7, 2009|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state was named after [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], the initiator of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].

It is located in [[Eastern Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sanp&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= S&amp;P Rates State of Hidalgo, Mexico 'mxA- |newspaper=PR Newswure |location=New York |date=December 14, 2000 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hidalgo is bordered by [[San Luis PotosÃ­]] and [[Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave|Veracruz]] on the north, [[Puebla]] on the east, [[Tlaxcala]] and [[Estado de MÃ©xico|MÃ©xico]] on the south and [[QuerÃ©taro]] on the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.inegi.gob.mx/geografia/espanol/datosgeogra/basicos/estados/hgo_geo.cfm|title=InformaciÃ³n GeogrÃ¡fica Hidalgo|publisher=''[[Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica y GeografÃ­a]]''|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has a number of relatively intact native cultures such as the [[Otomi people|Otomi]]. There are also two notable immigrant cultures, those of the descendents of [[Cornish people|Cornish]] miners in the 19th century&lt;ref name=&quot;seijas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last= Seijas |first= Susana |title= Hidalgo's British bounty Inside Mexico |url=http://www.insidemex.com/travel/travel/hidalgos-british-bounty |accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a small Jewish enclave which claims to be descended from [[Sephardi Jews]] which came to [[New Spain]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;mystery&quot;/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Los atlantes de Tula.JPG|left|thumb|[[Stela]]e at the Tula archeological site]]
The modern day state of Hidalgo is located within the pre-Hispanic region of [[Mesoamerica]]. Numerous migrations of indigenous people took place through here, mostly arriving or passing through from the north, with many eventually settling in the Valley of Mexico. The [[Toltecs]] initially settled in [[XochicoatlÃ¡n]], now the municipality of [[Molango]] at the beginning of the 7th century. From here they dispersed to locales such as [[Huejutla de Reyes|Huejutla]] and Tollatzingo (now called [[Tulancingo]]) where they eventually had their capital of Tollan, today known as Tula.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/ |title= Estado de Hidalgo â Historia |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Stateof Mexico |accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toltecs were eventually overrun by [[Chichimeca]]s, who established their capital in [[MetztitlÃ¡n]]. The [[Aztec]]s arrived in the 12th century, initially establishing themselves in [[Mixquiahuala]], then founding [[Tizayuca]] later. Eventually, the Aztecs took over most of what is now the southern portion of the state, incorporating it into the [[Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the conquistadors carved out territories for themselves from Aztec lands. [[HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s]] took possession of lands to the northeast of Mexico City extending into modern Hidalgo state. Evangelization efforts followed soon thereafter with the first [[Franciscans]] arriving in 1523.This changed the social, economic and cultural structure of the areas as the Spanish took control of the natural resources especially minerals, and the labor the Indians provided. It also led to a massive decrease in the native population, especially during the governorship of the area by [[NuÃ±o BeltrÃ¡n de GuzmÃ¡n]]. By the 18th century, the economy of the Hidalgo area was dominated by mining and agricultural haciendas. Much of the agricultural production during the colonial period was centered on livestock such as sheep and pigs as well as the making of [[pulque]] from the native maguey plant. However, the mining of silver, gold and other metals in the Pachuca/[[Real del Monte]] area would be the economic backbone of the area through the colonial period and into most of post Independence period.  Miningâs fortunes would rise and fall during the colonial period with one of the most productive eras coming under the control of [[Pedro Romero de Terreros]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;

[[File:2008 08 17 Pachuca(2).JPG|thumb|left|Monastery of San Francisco in Pachuca]]
Despite Spanish control and evangelization efforts since the 16th century, by the 18th century, many of the Otomi and other indigenous groups of the area had not been fully subjugated, especially in the Sierra Gorda and Sierra Baja areas. These groups and others manage a significant amount of success in maintaining cultural, political and economic autonomy through the colonial period. Much of the state still maintains a number of strong indigenous identities.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;

Many in Hidalgo, especially the indigenous, supported [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]âs cause, providing leaders such as JosÃ© MarÃ­a Correa and JosÃ© Antonio Magos, both of whom were active in the [[Valley of Mezquital]] area. However, no major battles of the [[Mexican War of Independence]] were fought in the state. Instead, a number of smaller operations against local Spaniards were conducted. When the war ended in 1821, the country was divided into a number of states. The modern state of Hidalgo was initially part of the very large territory called âMexicoâ (which extended in all directions from Mexico City), which eventually was split with the remaining portion becoming the modern State of Mexico. What is now Hidalgo was originally the districts of Tula, Tulancingo and Huejutla of the former entity.  The state of Hidalgo would not be formally created until 1860s.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;

The economic consequences to the mines of Pachuca and Real del Monte during the War of Independence were ruinous. In 1824, British mining companies were brought in to revive the sector. The British introduced steam-powered machinery and other modern techniques as well as a large quantity of Cornish miners. Many of these Cornish miners stayed and English names and foods such as pasties (called âpastesâ in Spanish) help define the state, especially in the Pachuca and Real del Monte areas. These Englishmen were forced to sell their interest to Mexican capitalists in 1849, and the mining sector fell again.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;

In 1861, the government of the vast State of Mexico was centered in [[Toluca]], east of Mexico City. The distance of the capital was one of the reasons why Hidalgo state would eventually separate.  When [[French Intervention in Mexico|French forces invaded central Mexico in 1862]], the large territory of Mexico was divided into three military sectors for defense. The second district had its capital in [[Actopan, Hidalgo|Actopan]] and its borders were roughly commensurate with that of modern Hidalgo state. The French succeeded in placing [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] on the throne of Mexico, who visited Pachuca in 1865. Soon thereafter, insurgent activity against the French government intensified and after Maximilian was overthrown, the new republican government decided to make this military district the state of Hidalgo in 1869.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;  The state was named after Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, the first leader of the Mexican Independence movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;nomenclatura&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/nome.htm|title= Estado de Hidalgo â Nomenclatura |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Stateof Mexico Name|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the establishment of the state until the [[Porfirio DÃ­az]] period, the economy, especially the mining sector was erratic. In the late 1880s, a number of modern inventions, such as the [[telegraph]], telephone and railroad helped the Hidalgo economy. It also brought in another wave of foreign investment in the mining industry. By the mid 1900s, much of the mining production in Pachuca and Real del Monte was controlled by U.S. based interests such as the United States Mining Smelting and Refining Company. Pulque haciendas, primarily selling to nearby Mexico City, were prosperous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The prosperity of the state was best seen in the capital of Pachuca with the construction of many civic structures, but many rural areas were still quite impoverished. This situation would make the state favor the oncoming Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Mexican Revolution]], local armed groups, such as the one led by Francisco P. Mariel in Huejutla, faced off against government troops. Forces led by Nicolas Flores took Jacala and  threatened [[Zimapan]] and [[Ixmiquilpan]] in 1911. Later that same year Gabriel Hernandez took Tulancingo and Pachuca, forcing the then-governor out of power. After Porfirio Diaz fled the country, several factions would vie for power here. The government of the state was seized in 1915 by Agustin Sangins, who declared himself in favor of [[Victoriano Huerta]], prompting opponents to take up arms in the Huasteca area, [[Jacala]]  and Tulancingo. Victory initially went to those in support of Huerta. When Huertaâs government fell, the state had a chaotic succession of governors, each of whom supported different factions. When the war finally wound down by 1920, the state had a new constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;
In 1920, the first airmail flight took place with a biplane piloted by Horacio Ruiz GaviÃ±o taking off from Pachuca and landing in Mexico City 53 minutes later carrying 543 letters, 61 postcards and other items.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;
The war left the mining industry in ruins again and the desertion of same by the American companies. Modernization of the nearly destroyed infrastructure began in the 1920s with the reconstruction of telephone lines and the construction of highways within the state. In the 1930s, a number of companies such as [[Cemento Cruz Azul|Cruz Azul Cement]] were expropriated and popular credit schemes such as the Banco de Credito Ejidal were created. Over 130 schools in rural areas were also built. Construction and modernization of infrastructure would continue through the rest of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;
This wave of mining activity would decline in the mid 20th century, causing the deterioration of the stateâs economy, especially in the Pachuca area. In the 1950s and 1960s efforts were undertaken to shift the stateâs economy from agriculture and  mining to manufacturing.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Estado de Hidalgo Pachuca de Soto |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_hidalgo |publisher= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |language=Spanish |accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, an automotive motor production facility called Diesel Nacional (DINA) was constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;  The old Instituto CientÃ­fico Literario AutÃ³nomo de Hidalgo was converted to the [[Universidad AutÃ³noma del Estado]] in 1961,  with the purpose of turning out engineers and other professionals to provide the impetus for the development of industry. These efforts soon paid dividends and construction growth, especially of suburban subdivisions for workers in newly built factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; 

The growth of the [[Greater Mexico City]] area reached the southern border of Hidalgo state in the late 20th and early 21st century with the municipality of Tizayuca formally added into the region in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;zona&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Amplian a Hidalgo zona metropolitana |author= Ivan Ventura |author2=Manuel Duran |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 11, 2005 |page=3 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Metropolitan area extended to Hidalgo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem the extreme southern part of the state has had in the past decade is the contamination of water from the drainage of the Valley of Mexico. Mexico City pumps out excess water from the area, as the valley has no natural drainage, to the north into Mexico and Hidalgo states. This water is increasingly polluted and is causing damage to these northern zones. The state is negotiating federal and other help to treat and recycle this water so that it does not do further damage to state agriculture and environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;vjimenez&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Reclama Hidalgo polucion |author= Veronica Jimenez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=January 31, 2006 |page=16 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Hidalgo complains about pollution }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;negras&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Aguas negras: Contaminan cultivos |author= Ivan sosa |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=March 18, 2001 |page=10 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Sewerage contaminates crops }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:LordsPrayerOtomiIxmi.JPG|thumb|[[Lord's Prayer]] written in Spanish and Otomi at the Church of San Miguel in Ixmiquilpan]]
The state several indigenous groups which have managed to maintain a relatively strong independent cultural identity since the Conquest.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiaelocal&quot;/&gt;  These ethnic groups include the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], the Otomis and the [[Tepehua people|Tepehuas]], each still speaking their own language. The largest group is the Otomi, which has over 250,000 speakers in the state. The total number of people who speak an indigenous language of any kind was estimated at 320,029 in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;elocal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/soci.htm |title= Perfil SociodemogrÃ¡fico |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico Estado de Hidalgo |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Sociodemographic profile |accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BakedPastes.JPG|thumb|left|Baked pastes for sale in Pachuca]]
Population of the state historically has risen and fallen based on the state of the economy especially, the health of the mining sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;elocal&quot;/&gt;  When mining activity fell in the mid 20th century, the population fell as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt; The population began to recover in the 1980s. From then until 2000, the population grew from 1,547,493 to 2,235,591, leaving the state with a large number of people under the age of thirty.&lt;ref name=&quot;elocal&quot;/&gt;   The mining sector has also been responsible for immigration to the state, most notably that of the Cornish in the 19th century in the Pachuca and Real de Monte areas.  While most descendents of these Cornish immigrants now are monolingual Spanish speakers, many have retained the [[Protestant]] faith. The Cornish have had an impact on the cuisine here as well, with one of Hidalgoâs signature dishes being [[paste (food)|âpastesâ (pa-stays)]], which are [[pasty|Cornish dough pockets]] filled with Mexican style meat, vegetable and sweet fillings.&lt;ref name=&quot;seijas&quot;/&gt;

Over 90% identify themselves as Catholic with significant minorities as Protestant or evangelical.&lt;ref name=&quot;elocal&quot;/&gt; Another significant minority are those who practice the Jewish faith. Many of these claim ancestry from Sephardi Jews who came to New Spain in the 16th century to escape the [[Inquisition]] in Spain. When [[Mexican Inquisition|it reached New Spain]], these people moved to the rural hills to continue their practice clandestinely. These are mostly concentrated in the community of Venta Prieta. While their claims have not been proven, there are indications that they are true. Most practitioners in Venta Prieta are [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mystery&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican mystery |author=Sandro Cohen |newspaper=The Jerusalem Report|location=Jerusalem |date=February 28, 1991 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Hidalgo's literary history extends back to the 19th century with the oldest notable writers being [[Ignacio RodrÃ­guez GalvÃ¡n]] and [[JosÃ© MarÃ­a RodrÃ­guez y Cos]]. RodrÃ­guez GalvÃ¡n was born in 1816 in Tizayuca and is considered to be the first Mexican Romance writer. He wrote poetry and plays as well as founding a newspaper called AÃ±o Nuevo. RodrÃ­guez y Cos was born in 1823 in Tulancingo and represents Positivism in Mexico, writing poetry and plays. The most important poet from the 20th century is [[EfrÃ©n Rebolledo]] from ActopÃ¡n, who lived from 1877 to 1929. Other important writers from this century include [[Xavier Sorondo]], [[Margarita Michelena]], [[Gabriel Vargas]], [[Ricardo Garibay]], [[Gonzalo MartrÃ©]] and [[Miguel Ãngel Granadosa Chapa.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1418&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 14â18&lt;/ref&gt; Notable painters appear in the 20th century including [[Byron GÃ¡lvez]], [[Yadira GutiÃ©rrez]] and [[JosÃ© HernÃ¡ndez Delgadillo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1820&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 18â20&lt;/ref&gt; The best known musician from the state is [[Nicandro Castillo]], who wrote mostly popular music in the mid 20th century. As part of a performing group called Los Plateados, his work became part of a number of Mexican films, including Cuando habla el corazÃ³n, Seda, sangre y sol and AsÃ­ se quiere en Jalisco. Other important musicians from the state include [[Abundio MartÃ­nez]] and [[Demetrio Vite HernÃ¡ndez]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones2021&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 20â21&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known celebrity and artist from the state is Rodolfo GuzmÃ¡n Huerta, better known as [[El Santo]]. Born in Tulancingo in 1917,not only was he Mexico's best known [[lucha libre]] wrestler, he experienced success in the movies, playing his lucha libre character battling evil. He never took off his mask in public, until a few weeks before his death in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones2223&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 22â23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Day of the Dead]] in the state is referred to as the &quot;Xantolo&quot; which extends from October 31 to November 2. Like in other parts of Mexico, the days around November 2 honor the dead with altars and offerings, although each community has its own variations. One area which is known for its traditions is [[Huejutla de Reyes]], where altars dedicated to the dead are especially large and profusely decorated with flowers, colored paper and traditional foods, with the intention of counteracting mourning. In a number of areas, rituals based on Huasteca traditions are also performed. One of these is called the &quot;Danza de Xantolo,&quot; in which masked figures in robes dance in candlelight. In other communities, youths in costume will dance from house to house, to be invited in to eat dishes prepared for the occasion. Another tradition is to have bands play at the cemeteries on November 2, where tombs are cleaned and decorated with flowers, garlands and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones2529&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 25,29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Native gastronomy==

The Mezquital Valley has best preserved the stateâs indigenous, especially [[Otomi people|Otomi]], culinary heritage based a number of traditional native animal and vegetable products. One of these is the use of a number of [[Entomophagy|edible insects]], many of which are considered delicacies such as [[escamoles]] (ant eggs) and [[maguey worm|maguey larvae]] as well as others such as larvae found on nopal plants, âchacas â (beetles) and âchicharrasâ ([[cicadas]]). Other local animals still used for food include [[tadpoles]] (called atepocates), [[salamander]]s and their larvae, squirrels and rabbits. Plant species still commonly used include mesquite beans, nopal  and other cactus and various cactus fruit such as âtunaâ and â[[xoconostle]].â These are often prepared in dishes that the state shares with most of the rest of Mexico such as tacos, [[tamale]]s, moles and a specialty of central Mexico, [[mixiote]]. Another common central Mexican dish popular in the state is [[barbacoa]]. This dish has its origins in the pre-Hispanic period, when it was meat cooked in an underground pit. Today, it is most often cooked in pots in more conventional ovens, but the meat, today mostly pork, is still smothered in the alcoholic beverage pulque and wrapped in maguey leaves for flavor. This preparation of barbacoa is considered to be the state dish.&lt;ref name=&quot;HidTlax&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Hidalgo Tlaxcala |series=Cocina Estado por Estado |volume=13 |year=2009 |publisher=El Universal newspaper, CompaÃ±ia PeriodÃ¬sta SA de CV and Radar Editores SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |oclc=04-2009-1013135106000-102 (No. de Reserva de derechos al uso exclusive) |page=2,4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
The state secretary of tourism has divided the stateâs attraction into âcorridorsâ with similar themes. The Corridor de la MontaÃ±a (Mountain Corridor) is devoted to ecotourism and includes a number of different climates and ecosystems. These areas favor activities such as camping, extreme sports and well as family activities. They include places such as old mining haciendas, archeological sites and state parks. Municipalities which are promoted under this category include [[Mineral del Monte]], [[Huasca del Ocampo]] and [[Mineral del Chico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cmontaÃ±a&quot;/&gt;
The Corridor de los Balnearios (Water Park Corridor) list most of the major water parks, spas, natural pools and thermal springs in the state. Hidalgo ranks second in Mexico for the number of thermal springs. These springs have an average temperature of 38C but some reach as high as 80C. They exist due to rivers of magma that flow under the surface. Municipalites promoted under this category include Ixmiquilpan, Actopan and [[Cardonal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;balenarios&quot;/&gt; 

The Corridor Tulancingo y los 4 elementos (Tulancingo y the 4 elements Corridor) is named for its major location of Tulancingo and the sports that are promoted here. Sporting activities are classed under the elements of air, water, fire and earth and include [[hot air ballooning]], fishing, boating, rustic ironwork produced in [[Apulco, Hidalgo|Apulco]] and hiking in the natural landscapes. The area extends from the municipality of Tulancingo to the municipality of [[Huehuetla]]. (4elementos)

The Corridor de las Haciendas (Haciendas Corridor) contains most of the stateâs 176 former haciendas which were constructed between the 16th and the 19th centuries.  Most were devoted to mining or the making of pulque. Many contain the original buildings, including the main residences as well as tours. Many of these are in rural municipalities, which conserve old traditions. In the [[Apan]] area, most of the old haciendas were devoted to the making of pulque, which is still made and can be sampled. The area also contains many of the stateâs former colonial monasteries as well as civic constructions such as the [[Aqueduct of Padre Tembleque|Padre Tembleque Aqueduct]].&lt;ref name=&quot;haciendas&quot;/&gt;

The Sierra de la [[Huasteca]] Corridor covers this mountain range which is home to the [[Huastec people]].  The area includes ecotourism activities, camping and fishing in an area filled with dense vegetations and heated water sources. Municipalities featured here include Huejutla de los Reyes, [[Xantolo]] and  Molango  where many indigenous people live. The cuisine of the area is also emphasized.&lt;ref name=&quot;huasteca&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hidalgo.travel/de_visita/que_ver/corredores/Corredor_sierra_huasteca.aspx |title= Corredor Sierra de la Huasteca |work=Hidalgo Travel |publisher=State of Hidalgo |location=Hidalgo, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Sierra de la Huasteca Corridor |accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tolteca Corridor centers on the archeological site of Tula, which was the home of one of the principal pre-Hispanic civilizations of Mexico.  Many of the oldest monasteries of the state, founded in the 16th century, are located here. Featured municipalities include Tula de Allende, [[Atotonilco de Tula]], [[Tepeji|Tepeji del Rio]], Mixquiahuala, [[Tlahuelilpan]], [[Tlaxcoapan]] and [[Tezontepec]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ctolteca&quot;/&gt;

==Geography, climate and nature==
[[File:Mirador peÃ±a del cuervo.jpg|thumb|PeÃ±a del Cuervo in El Chico National Park]]
The terrain of the state is very rugged. At its lowest point it is only a few meters above sea level and it is over 3,300 meters above sea level at its highest. The state is divided into three geographical regions: the Coastal Plain, the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], and the Altiplano Meridional, which contains the highest peaks. Each of these regions are distinct from each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/ |title= Estado de Hidalgo â Medio Fisico |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Stateof Mexico Physical Geography|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north of the state has the lowest elevation and the hottest climate. It is also the smallest region of the state.  The second region averages about 800 meters above sea level and is more temperate in climate. The coldest climates at the highest areas are the most populated and average about 2,000 masl.(regions)Major elevations in the state include Cerro la PeÃ±uela (3,350 masl), Cerro el Jihuingo (3,240masl), Cerro la Paila (3,200 masl), Cerro las Navajas (3,180 masl), Cerro el Agual Azul (3,040 masl) and Cerro la Estancia (3,020 masl).&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; 
Principal rivers include the [[Tula River|Tula]], [[Amajac River|Amajac]] and the Metztitlan. Other rivers in the state flow into these three, such as the Rosas, Cuautitlan , Guadalupe and Salado, which flow into the Tula River. One exception to this is the San Juan River, which forms part of the stateâs border with [[QuerÃ©taro]]. This river flows into the [[PÃ¡nuco River]] in [[San Luis PotosÃ­]]. The Amajac begins in the Sierra de Pachuca and flows southeast. The Metztitlan River begins at the stateâs border with [[Puebla|Puebla state]] and eventually flows into Metztitlan Lake. Principal lakes in the state are the Metztitlan, Zupitlan or Tulancingo, San Antonio, Pueblilla and Carrillos. The state also has a significant number of sulfur and hot water springs such as La Cantera in Tula, Mixquiahual and Vito in Atotonilco, TephÃ© in Ejido TephÃ©, Humedades y Dios Padra in Ixmiquilpan and Tolantongo and Textacapa in Cardonal.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Xihuingo Esperanto Naturo2.jpg|thumb|Arid vegetation in Xihuingo]]
There are three main climates in the state. The lowlands are hot with temperatures rising as high as 44C in the summer in places such as the municipality of [[Pisaflores]]. Temperate regions can have hot days but often the temperature is moderated by cooler winds and clouds. Cold climates dominate the highest altitudes where freezing temperatures at night are not uncommon. Rainfall varies widely from as low as 250mm per year to as high as 2,800mm per year. The main indicator of climate type is altitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Most plants are either of the desert type with pines and [[holm oak]] in the higher mountain areas. A small area is the Huasteca region is highland rainforest. Wildlife includes thirty one species of serpent, thirteen species of duck, six of doves, three of falcons, as well as  mammals such as skunks, [[spider monkey]]s, [[wild boar]], [[anteater]]s and gray foxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the three main geographic/climate regions, the state subdivides into a number of sub-regions. Sub-regions include the La Huasteca area. This extends like a green sash across part of the state, and altitude does not exceed 800 masl. It is mostly located near the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] and receives a significant amount of rainfall from this body of water. The Huasteca is highland rain forest with plants blooming nearly year-round. Forests contain species such as âtlacuilo,â  holm oak, [[Copaifera]], âzuchiate,â [[mahogany]], white cedar and many others. The area has one of the widest varieties of wild birds including eagles, hummingbirds, wild turkeys and more. Reptiles include a wide variety of snakes and mammals include coyotes, bobcats, wild boar, spotted deer, rabbits and more. Tropical crops are raised here including sugar cane, coconuts, pineapple, bananas, [[mamey]], [[tamarind]] and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Santa MarÃ­a desde la Quebradora 1.JPG|thumb|Santa MarÃ­a from La Quebradora]]

The Sierra Alta region is part of the Sierra Madre Oriental. Some of Hidalgoâs main peaks are located here such as the Cerro del Aguila, Cerro del Santo Roa and Cerrro de Agua Fria. There is also a volcanic cone by the name of Cerro la Aguja de Calnali. Many of Hidalgoâs caves, such as Texcatete in [[Zacualtipan]], Texcapa in Tepehuacan  and Tecamachal and Villacastla in Molango, are located  here. This mountain range is part of the temperate climate zone of the state.(regions)
The Sierra Baja is also located in the Sierra Madre Oriental and is characterized by small plains surrounded by stony peaks. There are five major canyons located here, oriented from south to north, which take their names from the rivers that form them:Amajac, Meztitlan, Amolon, Mezquititlan and Tolantongo. Although lower than the temperate Sierra Alta, it still has a temperate climate due to strong, moist winds which flow from the northeast.(regions)
The Sierra Gorda is a branch of the Sierra Madre Oriental which crosses northwest Hidalgo and ends in San Luis PotosÃ­. These are mostly mountains of volcanic origin. The Tula and Moctezuma Rivers meet here, whose waters then cut the Moctezuma Canyon, which has walls up to 480 meters high.&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;/&gt;

The Sierra de Tenango begins to one side of the Valley of Tulancingo and extends down to the Huasteca region of Puebla and [[Veracruz]]. It is also called the Sierra Norte de Puebla and the Sierra de Huayacocotla. These are low lying mountains with a humid, cloudy temperate climate with frequent rain in the summer. Two of Hidalgoâs main dams, the Tejocotal and the Omitemetl are located on the rivers here, and are part of the Necaxa hydroelectrical system.&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/ |title= Estado de Hidalgo â RegionalizaciÃ³n |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Stateof Mexico Regional divisions |accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Valley of Tulancingo has a temperate climate with an average year round temperature of 15C. It is bordered by the Sierra de Tenango and the highlands of Apan. It is a large fertile valley with extensive agriculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Llanos de Apan.jpg|thumb|Plains around Apan in the south of the state]]
La Comarca Minera is the mountain area around Pachuca and Real del Monte and contains the Cerro de las Navajas, a mountain made mostly of [[obsidian]]. It extends from the Pachuca area north towards the municipality of Huasca then east towards Actopan. From Pachuca it extends a short ways south to Mineral de la Reforma and Comarca. In almost all of this region, there is extensive mining, both of precious metals as well as lead and building stone such as sandstone and marble. Over 38 million kilograms of silver and 200 tons of fine gold have been extracted since the Conquest, which nearly equals the weight of the stone used to build the Tembleque Aqueduct. In additions to mines, the area is home to extensive forests of [[oyamel fir]], pines and holm oak. Many of its peaks are rocky and barren such as Zumate in Omitlan, PeÃ±as Cargadas in Real del Monte and PeÃ±a del Conejo in San Jeronimo.&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;/&gt;

The Altiplano Meridonal or central high plains are centered around the municipality of Apan and is best known as a major pulque-producing area, although it is also a major producer of [[barley]] for beer-making. In pre-historic times, the area was a huge lake, of which only three small lakes remain today. One is called Apan, which exists only during the rainy season, Tocha or Atocha, which is mostly swamp, and Tecocomulco,which is very shallow and filled with reeds. The soils here are of volcanic origin from local volcanoes such as TepozÃ¡n, Jehuingo, Coatzengo and Tecajete. The climate of the area is cold with frequent freezes in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;/&gt;

The very north of the Valley or Basin of Mexico is located within the state, which is separated from the area in which Mexico City is found by a series of low lying mountains.  This part of the Valley extends from Tizayuca towards Pachuca. It is separated from the Valley of Mezquital by the Sierra de Tezontlalpan and from the rest of the Valley of Mexico by the low lying Sierra de los Pitos. The climate here is temperate and semi arid with occasional freezes. Except for the forests on the mountain tops, the flora and fauna are those found in more arid regions such as maguey, yucca, rabbits, armadillos and mesquite trees.&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;/&gt;

Since many of the mountains surrounding Pachuca lack tree cover, little slows the prevailing winds which can reach speeds of up to 120&amp;nbsp;km per hour. This gives the capital city the nickname of La Bella Airosa (Beautiful, Windy City).&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;/&gt;

[[File:AboveTunnelTolantongo.JPG|150px|Thermal springs at [[Tolantongo]].]]

The Valley of Mezquital is three three valleys called the Actopan, the Ixmiquilpan and the Tasquillo as well as flat areas known as Tula and Alfajayucan. The vegetation is mostly that of semi arid regions with mesquite trees and various types of cacti growing. The only areas with tree cover are those near streams and other water sources and on the mountain tops of the peaks. Despite this, the region is considered to be Hidalgoâs granary, growing corn, beans, wheat, tomatoes, onions, oats, olives, cactus fruit, [[tejocote]] and much more. It produces more than half of the [[alfalfa]] and green chili peppers in Mexico. Due to the lack of rainfall, irrigation from the areas above and below ground streams is important. However, it is also one of the areas of Mexico with the highest levels of malnutrition. The valley averages 2000 meters above sea level and has a temperate climate with freezes being rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;regiones&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:AcostaMineMuseum.JPG|thumb|The old Acosta mine, now a museum]]
Traditionally, Hidalgoâs economy has been based on mining and agriculture, with manufacturing more recently.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuc&quot;/&gt;  Most industry is located in what is called the âUrban Industrial Corridor of the South, where most of the stateâs economic activity is located. Outside of this corridor, the economy remains based on subsistence farming and has high levels of poverty, with the per capita income only 61.5% of the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanp&quot;/&gt;  Industry accounts for more than 25% of the stateâs gross domestic product.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/hidalgo/ |title= Estado de Hidalgo â Actividad EconomÃ­a |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Stateof Hidalgo Economic Activity |accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the state has a higher-than-average growth, averaging 7.7% since the mid 1990s. The state consistently produces and overall surplus. Like other Mexican states, Hidalgo is heavily dependent on the federal government for revenues, with almost 97% of revenues from federal sources, which is high. The state's debt level is very low compared to other rated local and regional governments in Mexico and worldwide. One major debt issue is with pension funds but S&amp;P does not consider it onerous. The stateâs economic rating by [[Standard &amp; Poorâs]] is âmxA-â with a stable outlook.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanp&quot;/&gt;

The state contains 2.1 million hectares of land, 30% of which is cultivable. Most of this land is only farmed during the annual rainy season. Corn is the primary crop followed by barley, beans, oats, wheat, green chili peppers, squash and tomatoes. Thirty eight percent of the land is dedicated to grazing and livestock production. Fishing and fish farming are also important producing [[mojarra]], [[tilapia]], [[carp]], trout and charal.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;/&gt; Most of the surface area of the state (38%)  is used for the raising of livestock with 29% dedicated to agriculture. Forests cover about 22% of the state. Both pine and broadleaf forests are found in the higher mountain areas of the state. The lower altitude Huasteca has rainforest and semi-rainforest vegetation. Hidalgo has approximately 125,000 m3 of commercial timber with a estimated value of 47,771.701 pesos. Non-wood forest products are estimated to value 331,961 pesos. For much of the 20th century, forest size diminished. This is being countered with reforestation efforts over as much as 743,224 hectares, with about 2,500 hectares fully reforested every year. Just over 25% of the population if employed in agriculture and livestock production.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;/&gt;
[[File:BotPulqueFeriaHidalgo09.JPG|thumb|150px|Display of bottled [[pulque]] at the Feria de Pachuca]]
Mining is the oldest and most traditional large-scale economic activity in the state. The mining of [[magnesium]] provides the most income to the state, providing 28% of all revenues, followed by [[zinc]] (18%), silver (14.3%), [[limestone]] (12.9%) and [[lead]] (7.7%).&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;/&gt; Other minerals include gold, copper, [[cadmium]] and [[sulfur]]. Most precious metals such as gold, silver and copper are mined in Pachuca and Zimapan. Petroleum, [[natural gas]] and other similar deposits also exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; 

The most important commercial sector of the state is that of retail foodstuffs, especially those selling groceries, meat and poultry. This represented over 40% of the commercial sector as of 1998. Just over 30% of commerce was dedicated to non-food products such as clothing and pharmaceuticals with the rest mostly dedicated to wholesale foods. From the latter 20th century, tourism has taken up much of the economic slack left behind by the demise of much of the stateâs mining industry, with income from this sector surpassing that of the petroleum industry. The state has a variety of historic, cultural and natural attractions. Commerce and tourism employ about 44% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;/&gt;

Industrial production in the state centers on metal products, machinery and equipment, accounting for about 24% of the total. Non-metallic minerals, other than petroleum account for about 25%. However, the most important industry is automobile and train engine production, which is followed by the refining of petroleum products, based mostly in Tula.  Automotive and train production is centered in [[Ciudad SahagÃºn]]. Most of the automobiles produced are sold in Mexico City. Other industries include the production of [[cement]] in Tula de Allende and textiles in Tepeji del RÃ­o and Tulancingo. This employs about 30% of the population.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;/&gt; 

Construction accounts for about 4% of the economy of Hidalgo, with utilities such as electricity accounting for about the same. Hidalgo produces about 8.7% of the total electricity used in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;/&gt;

In many of the more rural parts of the state, the making of crafts such as textiles, baskets, wood items and more can contribute significantly to household income. Textile production is widespread, but some of the best embroidery is done in Tenango de Doria, in which blouses, skirts and more are covered in designs of bright colors. Another area with noted embroidery is AcaxochitlÃ¡n and nearby communities in the Sierra de Huasteca. The designs on these pieces are endemic to the area. In the Mezquital Valley, they make items with [[maguey]] fiber, often for rope, belts, bags and sandals. The weaving of cotton and wool into items such as blankets, wraps and other items is also a widespread craft. Fibers from maguey plants and palm trees are also used in the production of baskets, hats and mats. One native hat made from palm fronds is called &quot;garambullero&quot; as well as a type of rattle. Other materials worked into baskets and other items include reeds, willow branches and [[ixtle]]. The working of all these fibres and materials is primarily done by women.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones4447&quot;&gt;Gonzalez, pp. 44â47&lt;/ref&gt;

As the state has a relative abundance of wood, crafts based on this material is common. The most important product is the making of wood furniture, most of which is in a rustic Spanish style. Miniature boxes, flutes and other items are a speciality of a community called Nith in the Ixmiquuilpan municipality. Molango is noted for its guitars. Tenango is noted for the making of wooden utensils such as spoons and spatulas. Pottery production is categorized by the type of clay used.  In the Tulancingo Valley, the clay type is known as &quot;chapopote&quot; and is mostly worked into pots, [[comal]]s and other cooking items. Huejutla is known for its &quot;barro blanco&quot; (white clay), also used to make items for cooking. In [[Huasca de Ocampo]] red clay is abundant.  In Chililico, the clay is [[ochre]] and typically painted with images of birds and flowers.

In 1869, the Instituto Literario y Escuela de Artes y Oficios, the universityâs predecessor was founded. It was reorganized in 1872 under the Porfirio Diaz regime and in 1875, the school was moved from the house it was founded in on Allende Street to the former hospital of San Juan de Dios on the west side of Pachuca.
