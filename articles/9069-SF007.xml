'''Dia''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|d|iË|É}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.gnome.org/Dia/Faq|title=Dia Frequently Asked Questions|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is [[free and open source software|free and open source]] general-purpose [[diagramming software]], developed originally by Alexander Larsson. Dia uses a controlled [[single document interface]] (CSDI) similar to [[GIMP]] and [[Sodipodi]].

== Features ==
Dia has a modular design with several shape packages available for different needs: [[flowchart]], [[network diagram]]s, [[circuit diagram]]s, and more. It does not restrict symbols and connectors from various categories from being placed together.

Dia has special objects to help draw [[entity-relationship model]]s ([http://tedia2sql.tigris.org/ tedia2sql] can be used to create the SQL DDL), [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) diagrams, [[flowchart]]s, network diagrams, and simple electrical circuits. It is also possible to add support for new shapes by writing simple [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] files, using a subset of [[Scalable Vector Graphics]] (SVG) to draw the shape.

Dia loads and saves diagrams in a custom XML format, which is, by default, [[gzip]]ped to save space, and can print large diagrams spanning multiple pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohloh.net/p/dia |title=Dia |work=ohloh |publisher=Geeknet, Inc. |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be scripted using the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]].

== Exports ==
Dia can export diagrams to various formats including the following:
* [[Encapsulated PostScript|EPS]] (Encapsulated PostScript)
* [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]] (Scalable Vector Graphics)
* [[AutoCAD DXF|DXF]] (Autocad's Drawing Interchange format)
* [[Computer Graphics Metafile|CGM]] (Computer Graphics Metafile defined by [[ISO standard]]s)
* [[Windows Metafile|WMF]] (Windows Meta File)
* [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] (Portable Network Graphics)
* [[JPEG]] (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
* [[VDX (file format)|VDX]] (Microsoft's XML for [[Visio]] Drawing)

== Development ==
Dia was originally created by Alexander Larsson but he moved on to work on [[GNOME]] and other projects. James Henstridge then took over as lead developer but also moved on to other projects.

Dia is maintained by a group of developers Hans Breuer, Lars Clausen, Steffen Macke&lt;!-- windows --&gt;, Sameer Sahasrabuddhe.

Dia is written in C, and has a system of extensions that can be written in Python.
