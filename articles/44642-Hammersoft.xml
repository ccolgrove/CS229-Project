'''James Strom Thurmond''' (December 5, 1902 â June 26, 2003) was an American politician who served as a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]. He also ran for the [[President of the United States|Presidency of the United States]] in [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]] as the segregationist [[Dixiecrat|States Rights Democratic Party]] (Dixiecrat) candidate, receiving 2.4% of the popular vote and 39 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. Thurmond later represented South Carolina in the [[United States Senate]] from 1954 until 2003, at first as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and after 1964 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. He switched out of support for the conservatism of Republican presidential candidate and [[Arizona]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], who shared his opposition to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964 Civil Rights Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldwater&quot;&gt;{{cite news

He conducted the longest [[filibuster]] ever by a lone senator, in opposition to the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]], at 24 hours and 18 minutes in length, nonstop. In the 1960s, he continued to fight against civil rights legislation. He always insisted he had never been a racist, but was merely opposed to excessive federal authority. However, he infamously said that &quot;all the laws of Washington and all the bayonets of the Army cannot force the Negro into our homes, into our schools, our churches and our places of recreation and amusement&quot;, while attributing the movement for integration to Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/27/us/strom-thurmond-foe-of-integration-dies-at-100.html | work=The New York Times | first=Adam | last=Clymer | title=Strom Thurmond, Foe of Integration, Dies at 100 | date=June 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1970s, he moderated his position on race, but continued to defend his early [[Racial segregation|segregation]]ist campaigns on the basis of [[states' rights]] in the context of Southern society at the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;Noah&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy

==Early life and career==
James Strom Thurmond was born on December 5, 1902, in [[Edgefield, South Carolina]], the son of John William Thurmond (May 1, 1862 â June 17, 1934) and Eleanor Gertrude Strom (July 18, 1870 â January 10, 1958). He attended Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina (now [[Clemson University]]), where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.  Thurmond graduated in 1923 with a degree in [[horticulture]]. 

After Thurmond's death in 2003, an attorney for his family confirmed that in 1925, when he was 22, Thurmond fathered a [[mixed-race]] daughter, [[Essie Mae Washington-Williams]], with his family's housekeeper, Cassie Butler, then 16 years old. Thurmond paid for the girl's college education and provided other support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-12-15/us/thurmond..paternity_1_thurmond-family-essie-mae-washington-williams-carrie-butler?_s=PM:US|title=Strom Thurmond's family confirms paternity claim|last=Mattingly|first=David|date=December 16, 2003|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a farmer, teacher and athletic coach until 1929, when he was appointed [[Edgefield County, South Carolina|Edgefield County]]'s superintendent of education, serving until 1933. Thurmond studied law with his father and was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1930. He served as the Edgefield Town and County attorney from 1930 to 1938. In 1933 Thurmond was elected to the [[South Carolina Senate]] and represented Edgefield until he was elected to the Eleventh Circuit judgeship.

===World War II===
In 1942, after the U.S. formally entered [[World War II]], Judge Thurmond resigned from the bench to serve in the U.S. Army, rising to [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]]. In the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] (June 6 â August 25, 1944), he landed in a glider attached to the [[82nd Airborne Division]]. For his military service, he received 18 [[military decoration|decorations]], [[medal]]s and awards, including the [[Legion of Merit]] with [[Oak Leaf Cluster]], [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] with [[Valor device]], [[Purple Heart]], [[World War II Victory Medal]], [[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]], [[Belgium]]'s [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] and France's [[Croix de Guerre]]. 

During 1954â55 he was president of the [[Reserve Officers Association]]. He retired from the [[U.S. Army Reserves]] with the rank of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]].

===Governor of South Carolina===
Thurmond's political career began in the days of [[Jim Crow law]]s, when South Carolina strongly resisted any attempts at integration. Running as a Democrat, Thurmond was elected [[Governor of South Carolina]] in 1946, largely on the promise of making state government more transparent and accountable by weakening the power of a group of politicians from [[Barnwell, South Carolina|Barnwell]], which Thurmond dubbed the [[Barnwell Ring]] led by House Speaker [[Solomon Blatt, Sr.|Solomon Blatt]]. Thurmond was considered a progressive for much of his term, in large part due to his influence in arresting all those responsible for the [[Lynching|lynch mob murder]] of [[Willie Earle]]. Though none of the men were found guilty by the jury, Thurmond was congratulated by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] for his efforts.

===Run for President===
In 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]] desegregated the U.S. Army, proposed the creation of a permanent [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]], supported the elimination of state [[poll taxes]], and supported drafting federal anti-[[lynching]] laws.  Thurmond became a candidate for [[President of the United States]] on the [[Third party (politics)|third party]] ticket of the [[Dixiecrat|States' Rights Democratic Party]]. It split from the national Democrats over what was perceived as federal intervention in the segregation practices of the Southern states, which, among other issues, had largely [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites by constitutional amendments and electoral requirements from 1890 to 1910. Thurmond carried four states and received 39 electoral votes. One 1948 speech, met with cheers by supporters, included the following:{{audio|Strom Thurmond 1948 Speech Clip.ogg|listen}}

{{quote|I wanna tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that there's not enough troops in the army to force the [[Southern United States|Southern]] people to break down segregation and admit the nigger race into our theaters, into our swimming pools, into our homes, and into our churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slate.msn.com/?id=2075453|title=The Legend of Strom's Remorse|last=Noah|first=Timothy|date=December 16, 2002|work=Slate|accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early runs for Senate===
As Thurmond was constitutionally barred from seeking a second term as governor in 1950, he mounted a Democratic primary challenge against first-term U.S. Senator [[Olin Johnston]]. Both candidates denounced President Truman during the campaign. Johnston defeated Thurmond 186,180 votes to 158,904 votes (54% to 46%). It was the only statewide election Thurmond lost.

In 1952, Thurmond endorsed Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] for the Presidency, rather than the Democratic [[nominee]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]. This led state Democratic Party leaders to block Thurmond from receiving the nomination to the Senate in 1954, forcing him to run as a write-in candidate.

==Senate career==
===1950s===
Incumbent U.S. Senator [[Burnet R. Maybank]] was unopposed for re-election in 1954, but died in September of that year.  Democratic leaders hurriedly appointed [[South Carolina Senate|state Senator]] [[Edgar A. Brown]], a member of the Barnwell Ring, as the party's nominee to replace Maybank.  Widespread criticism of the party's failure to elect the nominee in a primary led to Thurmond announcing [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1954|that he would mount a write-in campaign]].  He campaigned, at the recommendation of Governor [[James F. Byrnes|James Byrnes]], on a pledge that he would resign in 1956 to trigger a contested primary.  Thurmond won overwhelmingly, becoming the first person to be elected to the [[South Carolina United States Senate election, 1954|U.S. Senate]] as a [[write-in candidate]] against ballot-listed opponents.&lt;ref name = &quot;write-in&quot;&gt;In 1946, recently appointed Sen. [[William F. Knowland]] of California won election for the remainder of his term on a blank ballot in which all candidates were write-ins.  In 2010, Sen. [[Lisa Murkowski]] of Alaska was denied renomination by her party but became the second write-in candidate to defeat ballot-listed opponents in a general election.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following through on his campaign promise, he resigned in 1956 and then won the Democratic primaryâin those days, the real contest in South Carolinaâfor the special election triggered by his own vacancy. His career in the Senate remained uninterrupted until his retirement 46 years later, despite his mid-career party switch.

Thurmond vehemently supported racial segregation with the longest [[Filibuster (legislative tactic)|filibuster]] ever conducted by a single senator, speaking for a total of 24 hours and 18 minutes in an unsuccessful attempt to derail the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]]. Cots were brought in from a nearby hotel for the legislators to sleep on while Thurmond discussed increasingly irrelevant and obscure topics, including his grandmother's biscuit recipe. Other Southern senators, who had agreed as part of a compromise not to filibuster this bill, were upset with Thurmond because they thought his defiance made them look incompetent to their constituents.&lt;ref&gt;Caro, Robert (2002). Master of the Senate: The Years of Lyndon Johnson, New York: Knopf. ISBN 0-394-52836-0&lt;/ref&gt;

According to journalist [[Jeff Sharlet]], he was a member of [[The Fellowship (Christian organization)|the Family]] (also known as the Fellowship), described by prominent evangelical Christians as one of the most politically well connected Christian organizations in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Sharlet |title=[[The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-055979-3 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s===
[[File:Strom Thurmond, c 1961.jpg|thumb|upright|Strom Thurmond, c. 1961]]
Throughout the 1960s, Thurmond generally received relatively low marks from the press and his fellow senators in the performance of his Senate duties, as he often missed votes and rarely proposed or sponsored noteworthy legislation.

Thurmond was increasingly at odds with the Democratic Party. On September 16, 1964, he [[Party switching in the United States|switched his party affiliation]] to Republican. He played an important role in South Carolina's support for Republican [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidates [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]]. South Carolina and other states of the [[Deep South]] had supported the Democrats in every national election from the end of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], when white Democrats re-established political control in the South, to 1960. However, discontent with the Democrats' increasing support for [[civil rights]] resulted in [[John F. Kennedy]]'s barely winning the state in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]]. After Kennedy's [[assassination]], President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s strong support for the [[Civil Rights Act]] of 1964 and integration angered white segregationists even more. Goldwater won South Carolina by a large margin in 1964.

In 1968, Richard Nixon ran the first GOP &quot;[[Southern strategy]]&quot; campaign appealing to disaffected southern white voters. Although segregationist Democrat [[George Wallace]] was on the ballot, Nixon ran slightly ahead of him and gained South Carolina's [[United States Electoral College|electoral]] votes. Due to the antagonism of white South Carolina voters toward the national Democratic Party, [[Hubert Humphrey]] received less than 30% of the total vote, carrying only majority-black districts.

At the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] in [[Miami Beach]], Thurmond played a key role in keeping Southern [[delegates]] committed to Nixon, despite the sudden last-minute entry of [[California]] Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] into the race. Thurmond also quieted conservative fears over rumors that Nixon planned to ask either [[Charles H. Percy|Charles Percy]] or [[Mark Hatfield]]âliberal Republicansâto be his running mate, by making it known to Nixon that both men were unacceptable for the vice-presidency to the South. Nixon ultimately asked [[Maryland]] Governor [[Spiro Agnew]]âan acceptable choice to Thurmondâto join the ticket.

At this time, too, Thurmond took the lead in thwarting Johnson's attempt to elevate Justice [[Abe Fortas]] to the post of [[Chief Justice]] of the United States. Thurmond's conservatism left him unhappy with the [[Earl Warren|Warren Court]].  He was glad to simultaneously to disappoint Johnson and to leave the task of replacing Warren to Johnson's presidential successor Richard Nixon.

Thurmond decried the Supreme Court opinion in ''[[Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education]]'', which ordered the immediate desegregation of schools in the American South.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward, Bob 1979 Page 56&quot;&gt;Woodward, Bob; Scott Armstrong (September 1979). ''The Brethren'', Simon &amp; Schuster. ISBN 0-671-24110-9. Page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond praised President Nixon and his &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; of delaying desegregation, saying Nixon &quot;stood with the South in this case&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodward, Bob 1979 Page 56&quot;/&gt;

===1970s===
Thanks to his close relationship with the Nixon administration, Thurmond found himself in a position to deliver a great deal of federal money, appointments and projects to his state. With a like-minded president in the White House, Thurmond became a very effective power broker in Washington. His staffers said that he aimed to become South Carolina's &quot;indispensable man&quot; in D.C.

On February 4, 1972, Thurmond sent a secret memo to [[William Timmons]] (in his capacity as an aide to Richard Nixon) and [[United States Attorney General]] [[John N. Mitchell]], with an attached file from the [[Senate Internal Security Subcommittee]] urging that British musician [[John Lennon#Political activism|John Lennon]] (living in [[New York City]] at the time) be deported from the United States as an [[undesirable alien]], due to Lennon's political views and activism. The document claimed that Lennon's influence on young people could affect Nixon's chances of [[1972 presidential election|re-election]], and suggested that terminating Lennon's visa might be &quot;a strategy counter-measure&quot;. Thurmond's memo and attachment, received by the White House on February 7, 1972, initiated the Nixon administration's persecution of John Lennon that threatened the former [[Beatle]] with deportation for nearly five years from 1972 to 1976. The documents were discovered in the [[FBI]] files after a [[Freedom of Information Act]] search by Professor [[Jon Wiener]], published in Weiner's book ''Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book 
|title=Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files |author=Wiener, Jon |year=2000
|isbn=978-0-520222465|publisher=University of California |url=http://books.google.com/?id=FPPj3e_cQIcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are discussed in the [[documentary]] film ''[[The U.S. vs. John Lennon]]'' (2006).

In [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]], he appeared in a campaign commercial for incumbent President [[Gerald Ford]] in his race against Thurmond's fellow [[Southern United States|Southerner]], former [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] governor [[Jimmy Carter]]. In the commercial, Thurmond declared that Ford (who was born in [[Nebraska]] and spent most of life in [[Michigan]]) &quot;sound[ed] more like a [[Politics of the Southern United States|Southerner]] than [[Jimmy Carter]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1976/strom-thurmond Ford campaign ad]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-1970 views regarding race===
In 1970, blacks were about 30% of South Carolina's population.&lt;ref name=PopRace&gt;Gibson, Campbell; Jung, Kay (September 2002). [http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html &quot;Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States&quot;]. U.S. Bureau of the Census â Population Division&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] was passed, African Americans were protected in exercising their constitutional rights as citizens to vote, and were generally able to register and vote without harassment. Their large numbers, combined with those of whites who supported civil rights, could no longer be ignored by state politicians.

Thurmond appointed African American [[Tom Moss (Senate staffer)|Thomas Moss]] to his staff in 1971, described as the first appointment by a member of the South Carolinian congressional delegation (also incorrectly reported by many sources as the first senatorial appointment of an African American, but Mississippi Senator [[Pat Harrison]] had hired clerk-librarian Jesse Nichols in 1937). In 1983, he voted to make the birthday of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] a [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|federal holiday]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Noah&quot;/&gt; In South Carolina, the honor was diluted, as until 2000 the state offered employees the option to celebrate this holiday or substitute one of three Confederate holidays instead. Despite his actions, Thurmond never explicitly renounced his earlier views on racial segregation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CO_071298&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Later career===
[[File:Reagan 1980 campaign.jpg|thumb|left|Thurmond, right, campaigns for [[Ronald Reagan]] in South Carolina in 1980]]
Thurmond became [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the US Senate]] in 1981, and held the largely ceremonial post for three terms, alternating with his longtime rival [[Robert Byrd]] depending on the party composition of the Senate.  During this period, he maintained a close relationship with the Reagan White House. 

Thurmond served as the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991 and worked closely with [[Joe Biden]], then the chairman.  He also joined the minority of Republicans who voted for the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]] in 1993.

On December 5, 1996, Thurmond became the oldest serving member of the U.S. Senate, and on May 25, 1997, the longest-serving member (41 years and 10 months). He cast his 15,000th vote in September 1998.

[[File:Ron Strom.jpg|thumb|right|Thurmond with Reagan in the Oval Office|right]]

Towards the end of Thurmond's Senate career, there was controversy over his mental condition. His supporters argued that while he lacked physical stamina due to his age, mentally he remained aware and attentive and maintained a very active work schedule in showing up for every floor vote. He stepped down as Chairman of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] at the beginning of 1999, as he had pledged to do in late 1997.

Declining to seek re-election in 2002, he was succeeded by fellow Republican [[Lindsey Graham]]. 

Thurmond left the Senate in January 2003 as the United States' longest-serving senator (a record later surpassed by Senator Byrd). In his November farewell speech in the Senate, Thurmond told all  his colleagues &quot;I love all of you, especially your wives,&quot; the latter being a reference to his flirtatious nature with younger women. 

At his 100th birthday and retirement celebration in December, Thurmond stated &quot;I don't know how to thank you. You're wonderful people, I appreciate you, appreciate what you've done for me, and may God allow you to live a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/05/thurmond.birthday/index.html | publisher=CNN | title=Thurmond marks 100th birthday | date=December 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurmond's 100th birthday celebration, however, became controversial after Mississippi Senator [[Trent Lott]] made comments that were viewed as racially insensitive: &quot;When Strom Thurmond ran for president, [Mississippi] voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over the years, either.&quot;  These comments led to [[Trent Lott#Resignation from Senate leadership|Lott's ouster]] as Senate Majority Leader.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
Thurmond married his first wife, Jean Crouch (July 24, 1926 â January 6, 1960) in South Carolina's Governor's mansion on November 7, 1947. In April 1947, when Crouch was a senior at Winthrop College, Thurmond was a judge in a beauty contest in which she was selected as Miss South Carolina.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In June, upon her graduation, Thurmond hired her as his personal secretary. On September 13, 1947, Thurmond proposed marriage by calling Crouch to his office to take a dictated letter. The letter was to her, and contained his proposal of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 17, 1947 |title=A Governor Wins Secretary's Hand |journal=Life |volume=23 |issue=20 |pages=44â46 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1EgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crouch died of a [[brain tumor]] 13 years later; there were no children. 

He married his second wife, Nancy Janice Moore (born 1946), [[Miss South Carolina]] of 1965, on December 22, 1968. He was 66 years old and she was only 22. She had been working in his Senate office off and on since 1967. It is often said that he ran for president before she was born.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This is false; however, he was old enough to be eligible. They separated in 1991, but never divorced. The two remained married and close friends until his death.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He even considered resigning during his last term, but only if the Governor would appoint his wife to the seat as his replacement.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

At age 68 (with his wife Nancy at age 25) Thurmond fathered what was then believed to be his first child. His four children with Nancy are: beauty pageant contestant Nancy Moore Thurmond (1971â1993), who was killed when a drunk driver hit her in [[Columbia, South Carolina]]; former U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina and current South Carolina 2nd Judicial Circuit Solicitor [[James Strom Thurmond Jr.]] (born 1972);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nafusa.org/user_profile.php?memid=1123 NAFUSA.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solicitorscheckunit.net/Aiken.html Solicitorscheckunit.net]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Washington, D.C.]], homemaker [http://www.law.edu/alumni/CUALawyer/issues/spring2001/whoandwhere.cfm Juliana Gertrude Thurmond Whitmer] (born 1973);&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.strom.clemson.edu/strom/notice.html A]. Juliana was the mother of Strom Thurmond's [http://www.wyff4.com/news/542244/detail.html first grandchild B.] See also [http://amarillo.com/stories/061803/usn_peopleinthe.shtml C] and [http://chronicle.augusta.com/images/headlines/070203/strom2/slide14.shtml D]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charleston County, South Carolina]], Council Member [http://www.charlestoncounty.org/handheld/www/departments/Council/Thurmond.htm Paul Reynolds Thurmond] (born 1976).&lt;ref&gt;Elected to the Council in 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death== 
Thurmond died in his sleep on June 26, 2003, at 9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. of [[heart failure]] at a hospital in Edgefield, South Carolina. He was 100 years old. After lying in state in the rotunda of the State House in Columbia, a caisson carried his body to the First Baptist Church for services where then-Senator [[Joe Biden]] delivered a eulogy, and later to the family burial plot in Willowbrook Cemetery in Edgefield where he was interred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000254 Bioguide.congress.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyff4.com/download/2005/0630/4670699.pdf Wyff4.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Another daughter===
Six months after Thurmond's death, [[Essie Mae Washington-Williams]], an African-American woman of bright complexion, publicly revealed that she was Strom Thurmond's daughter. She was born to Carrie &quot;Tunch&quot; Butler (1909â1948), a maid who had worked for Thurmond's parents, on October 12, 1925, when Butler was sixteen years old and Thurmond twenty-two. He helped pay his daughter's way through college. Though Thurmond never publicly acknowledged Washington-Williams while he was alive, he continued to support her financially. These payments extended well into her adult life.&lt;ref name=&quot;60min&quot;&gt;{{Cite interview|title=Essie Mae On Strom Thurmond|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/17/60II/main589107.shtml|date=February 11, 2009|first=Essie Mae|last=Washington-Williams|format=Transcript|callsign=CBS|accessdate=November 28, 2011|interviewer=[[Dan Rather]]|program=''[[60 Minutes]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington-Williams has stated that she did not reveal she was Thurmond's daughter during his lifetime because it &quot;wasn't to the advantage of either one of us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;60min&quot;/&gt; She kept silent out of love and respect for her father&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews.com&quot;/&gt; and denies that there was an agreement between the two not to reveal her connection to Thurmond.&lt;ref name=&quot;60min&quot;/&gt;

After Washington-Williams came forward, the Thurmond family publicly acknowledged her parentage. Many close friends, staff members, and South Carolina residents had long suspected Washington-Williams was his daughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/16/national/16STRO.html?ex=1231218000&amp;en=0509c5d87e66cd7a&amp;ei=5070 | work=The New York Times | title=Thurmond Kin Acknowledge Black Daughter | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | date=December 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that Thurmond had always taken a great deal of interest in her. The young mixed-race woman had been granted a degree of access to Thurmond more appropriate to a family member than to a member of the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankkwheaton.com/uploads/INTRODUCTORY_REMARKS.pdf &quot;Essie Mae Washington-Williams&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Washington-Williams is eligible for membership in the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] through her Thurmond ancestry. Thurmond was a member of the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], a similar group for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Thurmond's Biracial Daughter Seeks to Join Confederacy Group |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/02/national/02daughter.html|work=The New York Times|date=July 2, 2004 |first=Shaila K.|last=Dewan|first2=Ariel|last2=Hart|quote=Evidently she is eligible: Senator Thurmond, once a fierce segregationist, was a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a similar group for men.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
