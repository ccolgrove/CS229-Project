'''Henderson''' is a major suburb of [[Auckland]], in the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. It is located 13 kilometres to the west of Auckland city centre, and two kilometres to the west of the [[Whau River]], a southwestern arm of the [[Waitemata Harbour]].

==Description==
The population was 4,026 in the [[New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings|2006 Census]], an increase of 123 from 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{NZ Quickstats|3510800|Henderson South}}&lt;/ref&gt;
