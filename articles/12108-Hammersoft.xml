The term has now been replaced by the more literal ''Hellenic Republic''.&lt;/ref&gt; is a country in southeastern Europe.  

Greece has land borders with [[Albania]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north, and [[Turkey]] to the east. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of mainland Greece, the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south.  Greece has the [[list of countries by length of coastline|twelfth longest coastline]] in the world at {{convert|13676|km|0|abbr=on}} in length, featuring a vast number of [[List of islands of Greece|islands]] (approximately 1,400, of which 227 are inhabited), including [[Crete]], the [[Dodecanese]], the [[Cyclades]], and the [[Ionian Islands]] among others. Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains, of which [[Mount Olympus]] is the highest at {{convert|2917|m|0|abbr=on}}.

Modern Greece traces its roots to the civilization of [[ancient Greece]], generally considered the cradle of [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. As such, it is the birthplace of democracy,&lt;ref&gt;[[Moses I. Finley|Finley, Moses I.]] (1985).  ''Democracy Ancient and Modern''. 2d ed.  London: [[Hogarth Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Copleston|Copleston, Frederick]].

This legacy is partly reflected in the seventeen [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Greece|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]] located in Greece, ranking Greece [[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|7th in Europe and 13th in the world]]. The modern Greek state was established in 1830, following the [[Greek War of Independence]].

[[Athens]] is the capital and the largest city in the country (its urban area also including [[Piraeus]]).

==Name==
The '''[[name of Greece]]''' differs in Greece in comparison with the names used for the country in other languages and cultures, just like the [[names of the Greeks]]. Although the [[Greeks]] call the country ''Hellas'' or ''Ellada'' ({{lang-el|ÎÎ»Î»Î¬Ï, ÎÎ»Î»Î¬Î´Î±}}) and its official name is Hellenic Republic, in English the country is called Greece, which comes from [[Latin]] ''Graecia'' as used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and literally means 'the land of the Greeks', and derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] name ''[[:wikt:ÎÏÎ±Î¹ÎºÏÏ|ÎÏÎ±Î¹ÎºÏÏ]]''; however, the name ''Hellas'' is sometimes used in English too.

[[File:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of the [[Alexander Mosaic]], depicting [[Alexander the Great]] on his horse [[Bucephalus]].]]

While the area around Attica was inhabited during the Upper Paleolithic period (30000 â10000 BC), archaeological evidence suggests that the small caves around the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis rock]] and the Klepsythra spring were in use during the Neolithic Period (3000â2800 BC). Greece was the first area in Europe where advanced early civilizations emerged, beginning with the [[Cycladic civilization]] of the Aegean Sea, the [[Minoan civilization]] in Crete and then the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] civilization on the mainland. Later, various Greek kingdoms and [[city-state]]s emerged across the Greek peninsula and spread to the shores of the [[Black Sea]], [[Magna Grecia|South Italy]] and [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], reaching great levels of [[wealth|prosperity]] that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of [[classical Greece]], expressed in [[Architecture of ancient Greece|architecture]], [[Theatre of ancient Greece|drama]], science and [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosophy]], and nurtured in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] under a [[Athenian democracy|democratic]] environment.

Athens and [[Sparta]] led the way in repelling the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in a series of [[Greco-Persian Wars|battles]]. Both were later overshadowed by [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebes]] and eventually [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], with the latter under the guidance of [[Alexander the Great]] uniting and leading the Greek world to victory over the Persians.

The [[Hellenistic period]] was brought only partially to a close two centuries later with the establishment of [[Roman Greece|Roman rule]] over Greek lands in 146&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6930285.stm &quot;Alexander's Gulf Outpost Uncovered&quot;]. [[BBC News]]. 7 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greeks migrated to [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], [[Seleucia]] and the many other new Hellenistic cities in [[Seleucid Empire|Asia]] and [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Africa]] founded in Alexander's wake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/morris/120509.pdf|title=Growth of the Greek Colonies in the First Millenium BC | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]; requires[[Adobe Acrobat|Adobe Reader]]|publisher=[[Princeton University]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Byzantine Empire===
{{main|Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Greece}}

The Byzantine Empire existed for more than a thousand years, from the 4th century to 1453. During most of its existence, it remained one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe, despite setbacks and territorial losses, especially during the [[ByzantineâSassanid Wars|Roman-Persian]] and [[Byzantine-Arab Wars]]. The Empire recovered during the [[Macedonian dynasty]], rising again to become a preeminent power in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] by the late 10th century, rivalling the [[Fatimid Caliphate]]. 

[[File:The Byzantine Empire, c.1180.PNG|thumb|200px|The Greek peninsula as a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in purple, c.1180, at the end of the Komnenian period.]]

After 1071, however, much of [[Asia Minor]], the Empire's heartland, was lost to the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The [[Komnenian restoration]] regained some ground and briefly reestablished dominance in the 12th century, but following the death of [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] and the end of the [[Komnenos dynasty]] in the late 12th century the Empire declined again. The Empire received a mortal blow in 1204 from the [[Fourth Crusade]], when it was dissolved and divided into competing Byzantine Greek and [[Frankokratia|Latin]] realms. 

Despite the eventual recovery of Constantinople and [[Byzantium under the Palaiologoi|re-establishment of the Empire in 1261]], under the [[Palaiologos|Palaiologan]] emperors, Byzantium remained only one of many rival states in the area for the final 200 years of its existence. However, this period was the most culturally productive time in the Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;fordham&quot; /&gt;

Successive civil wars in the 14th century further sapped the Empire's strength, and most of its remaining territories were lost in the [[Byzantine-Ottoman Wars]], which culminated in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] and the conquest of remaining territories by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century. On the [[ByzantineâOttoman Wars|eve]] of the Ottoman conquest much of the Greek intelligentsia migrated to [[Italy]] and other parts of Europe not under Ottoman rule, playing a significant role in the [[Renaissance]] through the transmission of [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] works to Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displaystory.cfm?story_id=346800|title=Millennium Issue: Trouble with Turkey The Fall of Constantinople|work=The Economist  |date=20 March 1997 |accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman millet]] system contributed to the cohesion of the Orthodox Greeks by segregating the various peoples within the empire based on religion, as the latter played an integral role in the formation of modern Greek identity.

===The Greek War of Independence===
{{main|Greek War of Independence}}
[[File:Nea Epidavros2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Memorial with the text of the ''[[wikisource:Greek Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]'', signed on 1 January 1822 at the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]].]]

In 1814, a secret organization called the [[Filiki Eteria]] was founded with the aim of liberating Greece. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolution in the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Danubian Principalities]] and [[Constantinople]]. The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities under the leadership of [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792â1828)|Alexandros Ypsilantis]], but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north urged the Greeks in the Peloponnese in action and on 17 March 1821 the [[Maniots]] declared war on the Ottomans. By the end of the month, the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Ottomans and by October 1821 the Greeks under [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] had captured [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripolitsa]]. The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in [[Crete]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Central Greece]], which would soon be suppressed. Meanwhile, the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the [[Aegean Sea]] and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea.

[[File:The sortie of Messologhi by Theodore Vryzakis.jpg|thumb|upright|''The sortie of Messolonghi'', during the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek War of Independence (1821â1830)]], by [[Theodoros Vryzakis]].]]

Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Sultan]] negotiated with [[Mehmet Ali of Egypt]], who agreed to send his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of [[Missolonghi]]âput under siege by the Turks since April 1825âfell in April 1826. Although Ibrahim was defeated in [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]], he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and [[Athens]] had been retaken.

Following years of negotiation, three Great Powers, [[Russian Empire|Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Bourbon Restoration|France]], decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined OttomanâEgyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], the allied fleet intercepted the OttomanâEgyptian fleet at [[Pylos|Navarino]]. Following a week long standoff, a [[Battle of Navarino|battle]] began which resulted in the destruction of the OttomanâEgyptian fleet. With the help of a [[Morea expedition|French expeditionary force]], the Greeks drove the Turks out of the Peloponnese and proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, the [[First Hellenic Republic|nascent Greek state]] was finally recognized under the [[London Protocol]] in 1830.

===Greece in the 19th century===
{{see also|Kingdom of Greece}}
[[File:King George's Portrait by Georgios Iakovidis.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[George I of the Hellenes]] by [[Georgios Jakobides]].]]

In 1827 [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], from [[Corfu]], was chosen as the first governor of the new Republic. However, following his assassination in 1831, the [[Great Power]]s installed a [[Kingdom of Greece|monarchy]] under [[Otto of Greece|Otto]], of the Bavarian [[House of Wittelsbach]]. In 1843 an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly.

Due to his unimpaired authoritarian rule he was eventually dethroned in 1862 and a year later replaced by Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name [[George I of Greece|George I]] and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. In 1877 [[Charilaos Trikoupis]], who is credited with significant improvement of the country's infrastructure, curbed the power of the monarchy to interfere in the assembly by issuing the rule of [[Motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] to any potential prime minister.

[[File:Greekhistory.GIF|thumb|left|upright|Territorial evolution of [[Kingdom of Greece]] until 1947.]]

As a result of the [[Balkan Wars]] Greece increased the extent of its territory and population. In the following years, the struggle between [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] and charismatic Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] over the country's foreign policy on the eve of World War I dominated the country's political scene, and divided the country into [[National Schism|two opposing groups]].

In the aftermath of The First World War [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|Greece fought against Turkish nationalists]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk|Mustafa Kemal]], a war which resulted in a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|massive population exchange between the two countries]] under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,451140,00.html ''The Diaspora Welcomes the Pope''].

''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Instability and successive ''[[coup d'Ã©tat|coups d'Ã©tat]]'' marked the following era, which was overshadowed by the massive task of incorporating 1.5 million Greek [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|refugees from Turkey]] into Greek society.

On 28 October 1940 Fascist [[Kingdom of Italy (1861â1946)|Italy]] demanded the surrender of Greece, but Greek dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]] refused and in the following [[Greco-Italian War]], Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania, giving the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] their first victory over [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces on land. The country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched German forces during the [[Battle of Greece]]. The German occupiers nevertheless met serious challenges from the [[Greek Resistance]]. Over 100,000 civilians died from starvation during the winter of 1941â42, and the great majority of [[History of the Jews in Greece|Greek Jews]] were deported to Nazi extermination camps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244154/Greece/26430/Greek-history-since-World-War-IGreece]. ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

After liberation, Greece experienced a bitter [[Greek Civil War|civil war]] between communist and [[anticommunist]] forces, which led to economic devastation and severe social tensions between [[right-wing politics|rightists]] and largely communist [[left-wing politics|leftists]] for the next thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Mazower|Mazower, Mark]]. ''After the War was Over''.&lt;/ref&gt; The next twenty years were characterized by marginalisation of the left in the political and social spheres but also by [[Greek economic miracle|rapid economic growth]], propelled in part by the [[Marshall Plan]].

King [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]]'s [[Apostasia of 1965|dismissal]] of [[George Papandreou (senior)|George Papandreou]]'s centrist government in  July 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence which culminated in a ''coup d'Ã©tat'' on 21 April 1967 by the United States-backed [[Greek military junta of 1967â1974|Regime of the Colonels]]. The brutal suppression of the [[Athens Polytechnic uprising]] on 17 November 1973 sent shockwaves through the regime, and a counter-coup established [[Brigadier]] [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]] as dictator. On 20 July 1974, as [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus]], the regime collapsed.

Former prime minister [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]] was invited back from Paris where he had lived in self-exile since 1963, marking the beginning of the [[Metapolitefsi]] era. On 14 August 1974 Greek forces withdrew from the integrated military structure of [[NATO]] in protest at the Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;History, Editorial Consultant: Adam Hart-Davis.  [[Dorling Kindersley]].

A democratic and republican [[Constitution of Greece|constitution]] was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a [[Greek republic referendum, 1974|referendum]] which chose to not restore the monarchy.

Meanwhile, [[Andreas Papandreou]] founded the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis's conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party, with the two political formations alternating in government ever since. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; Traditionally strained [[GreekâTurkish relations|relations with neighbouring Turkey]] [[GreekâTurkish earthquake diplomacy|improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999]], leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Turkey's [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|bid]] for EU membership.

Greece became the tenth member of the [[European Communities]] (subsequently subsumed by the [[European Union]]) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of remarkable and sustained economic growth. Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping and a fast-growing service sector have raised the country's standard of living to unprecedented levels. The country adopted the euro in 2001 and successfully hosted the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympic Games]] in Athens. More recently, it has been hit hard by the [[late-2000s recession]] and central to the related [[European sovereign debt crisis]]. The [[#2010â2011 economic crisis|Greek economic crisis]] and [[2010â2011 Greek protests|resultant, sometimes violent protests]] have roiled domestic politics and regularly threatened European and world financial-market stability in 2010-11.

Greece consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the [[Balkans]], ending at the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula (separated from the mainland by the [[Corinth Canal|canal]] of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]). Due to its highly indented coastline and numerous islands, Greece has the [[List of countries by length of coastline|twelfth-longest coastline]] in the world with{{convert|13676|km|mi|0|abbr=on}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2060.html?countryName=Greece&amp;countryCode=gr&amp;regionCode=eu&amp;#gr |title=The World Fact Book â Field Listing :: Coastline |accessdate=17 March 2011 |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; its land boundary is {{convert|1160|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The country lies approximately between latitudes [[35th parallel north|34Â°]] and [[42nd parallel north|42Â° N]], and longitudes [[19th meridian east|19Â°]] and [[30th meridian east|30Â° E]].

Greece features a [[Greek islands|vast number of islands]], between 1,200 and 6,000, depending on the definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marker, Sherry; Bowman, John; Kerasiotis, Peter; Sarna, Heidi |title= Frommer's Greek Islands |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2010  |page=12 |isbn= 978-0-470-52664-4 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=wvlP7D9C_7gC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=number+of+greek+islands#v=onepage&amp;q=number%20of%20greek%20islands&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 227 of which are inhabited. Crete is the largest and most populous island; [[Euboea]], separated from the mainland by the 60m-wide [[Euripus Strait]], is the second largest, followed by [[Rhodes]] and [[Lesbos]].

The Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters:  The [[Argo-Saronic Islands]] in the Saronic gulf near Athens, the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea, the [[North Aegean islands]], a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey, the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey, the [[Sporades]], a small tight group off the coast of Euboea, and the Ionian Islands, located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea.

Eighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe.  [[Mount Olympus]], the mythical abode of the [[Twelve Olympians|Greek Gods]], culminates at Mytikas peak {{convert|2917|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, the highest in the country. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the [[Pindus]] mountain range. The Pindus, a continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]], reaches a maximum elevation of {{convert|2637|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} at Mt. Smolikas (the second-highest in Greece) and historically has been a significant barrier to east-west travel.

The Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese, crosses the islands of [[Kythera]] and Antikythera and find its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of Crete where it eventually ends. The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland. Pindus is characterized by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes. The spectacular [[Vikos Gorge]], part of the [[Vikos-Aoos National Park]] in the Pindus range, is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Guinness World Records 2005: Special 50th Anniversary Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records | year=2004 | editor= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=D4wYAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Vikos%2BGuines | isbn= 9781892051226| page = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable formation are the [[Meteora]] rock pillars, atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries.

[[File:Greece topo.jpg|thumb|right|Topographical map of Greece.]]

Northeastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range, the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] range, spreading across the region of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]]; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests, including the famous Dadia forest in the [[Evros Prefecture]], in the far northeast of the country.

Expansive plains are primarily located in the prefectures of [[Thessaly]], [[Central Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]]. They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country.  Rare marine species such as the Pinniped Seals and the [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]] live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endangered [[brown bear]], the [[lynx]], the [[Roe Deer]] and the Wild Goat.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Greece belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the East Mediterranean province of the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of Greece can be subdivided into six [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Illyrian deciduous forests]], [[Pindus Mountains mixed forests]], [[Balkan mixed forests]], Rhodope montane mixed forests, Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests and Crete Mediterranean forests.

==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Greece}}
Greece primarily has a [[Mediterranean climate]], featuring mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This climate occurs at all coastal locations, including Athens, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, the Peloponnese and parts of the [[Sterea Ellada]] (Central Continental Grece) region. The [[Pindus]] mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country, as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average (due to greater exposure to south-westerly systems bringing in moisture) than the areas lying to the east of the range (due to a [[rain shadow]] effect).

The mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece (parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Central Greece]], [[Thessaly]], [[Western Macedonia]]) as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese â including parts of the prefectures of [[Achaia]], [[Arcadia]] and [[Laconia]] â feature an [[Alpine climate]] with heavy snowfalls. The inland parts of northern Greece, in Central Macedonia and [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] feature a [[temperate climate]] with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers with frequent thunderstorms. Snowfalls occur every year in the mountains and northern areas, and brief snowfalls are not unknown even in low-lying southern areas, such as Athens.

It has been revised twice since, in 1986 and in [[Greek Constitutional amendment of 2001|2001]]. The Constitution, which consists of 120 articles, provides for a [[separation of powers]] into [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch]]es, and grants extensive specific guarantees (further reinforced in 2001) of [[civil liberties]] and [[social rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Dagtoglou, P.D. ''Individual Rights''. I, p. 21.&lt;br&gt;Venizelos, E.

According to the Constitution, executive power is exercised by the President of the Republic and the [[Cabinet of Greece|Government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;con51,53&quot;/&gt; From the [[Greek Constitutional amendment of 1986|Constitutional amendment of 1986]] the President's duties were curtailed to a significant extent, and they are now largely ceremonial; most political power thus lies in the hands of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=&quot;M477-478&quot;&gt;Mavrias, K.''Constitutional Law''. 477â478, 486â487.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]], Greece's [[head of government]], belongs to the [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|current leader]] of the [[List of political parties in Greece|political party]] that can obtain a vote of confidence by the Parliament. The President of the Republic formally appoints the Prime Minister and, on his recommendation, appoints and dismisses the other members of the Cabinet.&lt;ref name=&quot;con51,53&quot;/&gt;

Legislative powers are exercised by a 300-member elective [[unicameralism|unicameral Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;con51,53&quot;/&gt; Statutes passed by the Parliament are promulgated by the President of the Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;con51,53&quot;/&gt; [[Elections in Greece#Election of the legislature|Parliamentary elections]] are held every four years, but the President of the Republic is obliged to dissolve the Parliament earlier on the proposal of the Cabinet, in view of dealing with a national issue of exceptional importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;con51,53&quot;/&gt; The President is also obliged to dissolve the Parliament earlier, if the opposition manages to pass a [[motion of no confidence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;con51,53&quot;/&gt;

The [[Judicial system of Greece|Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature and comprises three Supreme Courts: the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]] (ÎÏÎµÎ¹Î¿Ï Î Î¬Î³Î¿Ï), the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] (Î£ÏÎ¼Î²Î¿ÏÎ»Î¹Î¿ ÏÎ·Ï ÎÏÎ¹ÎºÏÎ±ÏÎµÎ¯Î±Ï) and the [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Court of Auditors]] (ÎÎ»ÎµÎ³ÎºÏÎ¹ÎºÏ Î£ÏÎ½Î­Î´ÏÎ¹Î¿). The Judiciary system is also composed of civil courts, which judge civil and penal cases and administrative courts, which judge disputes between the citizens and the Greek administrative authorities.

===Political parties===
{{Main|Political parties of Greece}}
Since the restoration of democracy, the Greek [[two-party system]] is dominated by the liberal-conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) and the social-democratic [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK).&lt;ref&gt;For a diachronic analysis of the Greek party system see T. Pappas, ''Transformation of the Greek Party System Since 1951'', 90â114, who distinguishes three distinct types of party system which developed in consecutive order, namely, a predominant-party system (from 1952 to 1963), a system of polarised pluralism (between 1963 and 1981), and a two-party system (since 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant parties include the [[Communist Party of Greece]] (KKE), the [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) and the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] (LAOS). In 2010, two new parties split off from ND and SYRIZA, the centrist-liberal [[Democratic Alliance (Greece)|Democratic Alliance]] (DS) and the moderate leftist [[Democratic Left (Greece)|Democratic Left]] (DA). [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], president of PASOK, won [[Greek legislative election, 2009|4 October 2009]], won with a majority in the Parliament of 160 out of 300 seats. A new government was sworn in on 20 June 2011, and received a marginal vote of confidence on June 22, with 155 votes for, 143 against, and two MPs absent.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC confidence&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Staff | title = Greek Government Survives Confidence Vote|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-13869428 |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate = 5 August 2011 |date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2010 economic crisis, the two major parties, New Democracy and PASOK, have seen a sharp decline in the share of votes in polls conducted, with predictions allocating just over 60% of eligible votes to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skai dikommatismos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Î£Îµ ÎµÎ»ÎµÏÎ¸ÎµÏÎ· ÏÏÏÏÎ· Î¿ Î´Î¹ÎºÎ¿Î¼Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÏÎ¼ÏÏ |language = [[Greek language|Greek]]|trans_title=Bipartism in freefall|url=http://www.skai.gr/news/politics/article/167391/se-eleutheri-ptosi-o-dikommatismos-kai-katholiki-apaxiosi-ton-kommaton-exousias/|quote=Only 11% of people asked say they are pleased with the way the government is handling the problems, and 6% [are pleased] with the opposition.

In November 2011, the two major parties joined the smaller [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] in a [[grand coalition]], pledging their parliamentary support for a [[government of national unity]] headed by former [[European Central Bank]] vice-president [[Lucas Papademos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucas Papademos named as new Greek prime minister|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15671354|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 November 2011|date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Greece (2011)}}
Since the [[Kallikratis programme]] reform entered into effect on 1 January 2011, Greece consists of thirteen [[modern regions of Greece|regions]] subdivided into a total of 325 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]]. The 54 old [[Prefectures of Greece|prefectures and prefecture-level administrations]] have been largely retained as ''[[regional units of Greece|sub-units]]'' of the regions. Seven decentralized administrations group one to three regions for administrative purposes on a regional basis. There is also one [[autonomous area]], [[Mount Athos]] ({{lang-el|Agio Oros}}, &quot;Holy Mountain&quot;), which borders the region of [[Central Macedonia]].

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Greece}}
Prominent issues in Greek foreign policy include the enduring [[Cyprus dispute]], the [[Aegean dispute]] with Turkey over the Aegean Sea and the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] with the [[Republic of Macedonia]], which Greece refers to internationally by the provisional reference &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot;. Also the British government in 1816 purchased the [[Parthenon Marbles]], forming a part of the collection known as the [[Elgin Marbles]] and placed on display in the [[British Museum]], where they stand now on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery. The debate continues as to whether the Marbles should remain in the British Museum or be returned to [[Athens]].

* [[Hellenic Army]]
* [[Hellenic Navy]]
* [[Hellenic Air Force]]

The civilian authority for the Greek military is the [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Ministry of National Defence]]. Furthermore, Greece maintains the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] for law enforcement in the sea and for search and rescue.

[[Conscription in Greece|Greece has universal compulsory military service]] for males, while females (who may serve in the military) are exempted from conscription. {{As of|2009}}, Greece has mandatory military service of nine months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the armed forces had been gearing towards a complete professional army system, the government had promised that the mandatory military service would be cut or even abolished completely.

Greek males between the age of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard. Service in the Guard is paid. As a member of [[NATO]], the Greek military participates in exercises and deployments under the auspices of the alliance.

The Greek economy (that is gross domestic product, GDP) expanded at an average annual rate of 4% from 2004â2007 and 2% during 2008 (at constant prices of 2000), one of the highest rates in the Eurozone. However, in 2009 GDP decreased by â1.9%. In 2010, a decrease of GDP by â2.5% to â4% is estimated, due to the current [[Greece#2010â2011 economic crisis|economic crisis]].

[[File:Euro banknotes.png|thumb|left|Greece introduced the euro in 2002.]]
In Greece, the euro was introduced in 2002. As a preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. However, all Greek euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it, unlike some other countries of the [[Eurozone]] where mint year is minted in the coin. Eight different designs, one per face value, were selected for the Greek coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Greece changed the common side of their coins. Before adopting the euro in 2002, Greece had maintained use of the [[Greek drachma]] from 1832.

In 2009, Greece had the EU's second-lowest [[Index of Economic Freedom]] (after [[Poland]]), ranking 81st in the world.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The country suffers from high levels of political and economic corruption and low global competitiveness relative to its EU partners.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The Greek economy faces significant problems, including rising unemployment levels and an inefficient government bureaucracy.{{Verify source|date=July 2011}}

[[File:Greece public debt 1999-2010.svg|thumb|History of the Greek debt between 1999 and 2010.]]
{{See also|Greek debt crisis}}
By the end of 2009, as a result of a combination of international and local factors (respectively, the world financial crisis and uncontrolled government spending), the Greek economy faced [[2010 European sovereign debt crisis|its most-severe crisis]] since the restoration of democracy in 1974 as the Greek government revised its deficit from an estimated 6% to 12.7% of gross domestic product (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;Lynn, Matthew (2011).

In early 2010, it was revealed that successive Greek governments had been found to have consistently and deliberately misreported the country's official economic statistics to keep within the [[Euro convergence criteria|monetary union guidelines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Rehn: No Other State Will Need a Bail-Out| url = http://euobserver.com/19/30015 |publisher=[[EU Observer]]| accessdate = 6 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Greece Paid Goldman {{Nowrap|$300 Million}} To Help It Hide Its Ballooning Debts| url =http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-greece-paid-goldman-300-million-to-help-it-hide-its-ballooning-debts-2010-2| publisher=[[Business Insider]] | accessdate = 6 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This had enabled Greek governments to spend beyond their means, while hiding the actual deficit from the EU overseers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Wall St. Helped To Mask Debt Fueling Europe's Crisis |work=The New York Times | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/business/global/14debt.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hp | date =  14 February 2010| accessdate = 6 May 2010 | author=Story, Louise; Thomas Jr, Landon; Schwartz, Nelson D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, the Greek government deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Greek Deficit Revised to 13.6%; Moody's Cuts Rating (Update2)| url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&amp;sid=aUi3XLUwIIVA | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate = 2 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was one of the highest in the world relative to GDP&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Staff | title = Britain's Deficit Third Worst in the World, Table| url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/7269629/Britains-deficit-third-worst-in-the-world-table.html| date =  19 February 2010| accessdate = 5 August 2011 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and public debt was forecast, according to some estimates, to hit 120% of GDP during 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author=Melander, Ingrid; Papchristou, Harry | title = Greek Debt To Reach 120.8 Pct of GDP in '10&amp;nbsp;â Draft| url =http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSATH00496420091105 |agency=Reuters  | date =  5 November 2009| accessdate = 5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of sovereign states by public debt|one of the highest rates in the world]].

As a consequence, there was a crisis in international confidence in Greece's ability to repay its sovereign debt. In order to avert such a default, in May 2010 the other Eurozone countries, and the IMF, agreed to a rescue package which involved giving Greece an immediate â¬{{Nowrap|45 billion}} in bail-out loans, with more funds to follow, totaling â¬{{Nowrap|110 billion}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Thesing, Gabi; Krause-Jackson, Flavia |title= Greece Gets {{Nowrap|$146 Billion}} Rescue in EU, IMF Package |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a9f8X9yDMcdI | publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=3 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Kerin Hope |title= EU Puts Positive Spin on Greek Rescue |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/08a87e4e-55c4-11df-b835-00144feab49a.html |work=Financial Times  |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to secure the funding, Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Rick|title=Lessons for Congress From the Chaos in Greece|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/rick-newman/2011/11/03/lessons-for-congress-from-the-chaos-in-greece|accessdate=3 November 2011|newspaper=US News|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their implementation will be monitored and evaluated by the [[European Commission]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10099143.stm &quot;Greece's Austerity Measures&quot;].

On 15 November 2010 the EU's statistics body Eurostat revised the public finance and debt figure for Greece following an excessive deficit procedure methodological mission in Athens, and put Greece's 2009 government deficit at 15.4% of GDP and public debt at 126.8% of GDP making it the biggest deficit (as a percentage of GDP) amongst the EU member nations (although some have speculated that Ireland's in 2010 may prove to be worse).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europolitics.info/economy-monetary-affairs/deficits-increase-in-eurozone-and-eu-artb287086-50.html| publisher=[[Eurostat]] |title=Deficits Increase in Eurozone and EU | author=van Puyvelde, Eric |date= Monday 15 November 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Ireland-worse-than-Greece-faces-financial-ruin-say-two-leading-economists--94688524.html| publisher=[[IrishCentral]] |title=Ireland Worse than Greece, Faces Financial Ruin, Say Two Leading Economists | author=Cooper, Patrick |date= 23 May 2010 |accessdate=31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/Ireland-worse-than-Greece-faces-financial-ruin-say-two-leading-economists--94688524.html| publisher=[[IrishCentral]] |title=Ireland Now Has a Worse Deficit Problem Than Even Greece |date= 3 October 2010 |accessdate=31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timiacono.com/index.php/2010/11/23/ireland-deficit-now-32-of-gdp/ |title=Ireland Deficit Now 32% of GDP? | publisher=[[Eurostat]] |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The financial crisis â particularly the [[austerity]] package put forth by the EU and the IMF â has been met with anger by the Greek public, leading to [[riots]] and [[social unrest]].

===Maritime industry===
{{Main|Greek shipping|List of ports in Greece}}
[[File:Piraeus.JPG|thumb|[[Piraeus]] is the largest port in Greece.]]

The shipping industry is a key element of Greek economic activity dating back to ancient times.&lt;ref name=&quot;shipping&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greece.org/poseidon/work/articles/polemis_one.html |title=The History of Greek Shipping |author=Polemis, Spyros M. |publisher=greece.org |accessdate=9 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, shipping is one of the country's most important industries. It accounts for 4.5% of GDP, employs about 160,000 people (4% of the workforce), and represents 1/3 of the country's trade deficit.&lt;ref name =nbg&gt;{{cite web | author=Press release |url=http://www.nbg.gr/en/pr_release_resb.asp?P_ID=463 | publisher=[[National Bank of Greece]] |title=Greek Shipping Is Modernized To Remain a Global Leader and Expand Its Contribution to the Greek Economy |date=11 May 2006 |accessdate=8 April 2007| archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20070831114031/http://www.nbg.gr/en/pr_release_resb.asp?P_ID=463|archivedate = 31 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, the size of the Greek fleet nearly doubled, primarily through the investment undertaken by the shipping magnates, [[Aristotle Onassis]] and [[Stavros Niarchos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.slate.com/?id=2124542&amp; |title = So Many Greek Shipping Magnates... | author=Engber, Daniel |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=17 August 2005 |accessdate = 5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of the modern Greek maritime industry was formed after World War II when Greek shipping businessmen were able to amass surplus ships sold to them by the U.S. government through the [[Ship Sales Act]] of the 1940s.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

According to a [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] report in 2010, the Greek merchant navy is the largest in the world at 15.96% of the world's total capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Shipping report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/rmt2010_en.pdf|title=Review of Maritime Transport 2010 |publisher=United Nations |year=2010|accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a drop from the equivalent number in 2006, which was 18.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Shipping report 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/rmt2006_en.pdf |title=Review of Maritime Transport 2006|publisher=United Nations |year=2006 |accessdate=10 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total tonnage of the country's merchant fleet is 186 million [[Deadweight tonnage|dwt]], ranked 1st in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Shipping report&quot; /&gt; In terms of total number of ships, the [[Greek Merchant Navy]] stands at 4th worldwide, with 3,150 ships (741 of which are registered in Greece whereas the rest 2,409 in other ports).&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Shipping report&quot; /&gt;  In terms of ship categories, Greece ranks first in both [[tanker (ship)|tankers]] and dry [[bulk carrier]]s, fourth in the number of [[container ship|containers]], and fourth in other ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bts.gov/publications/maritime_trade_and_transportation/2002/html/table_01_05.html|title=Top 20 Ranking of World Merchant Fleet by Country of Owner as of 1&amp;nbsp;January 2001|publisher=U.S. [[Bureau of Transportation Statistics]] |year=2001 |accessdate=8 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, today's fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=shipping/&gt; Additionally, the total number of ships flying a Greek flag (includes non-Greek fleets) is 1,517, or 5.3% of the world's dwt (ranked 5th).&lt;ref name=&quot;UN Shipping report&quot; /&gt;

[[File:BrugPatras.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Rio-Antirio bridge]] near the city of Patras is the longest [[cable-stayed bridge]] in Europe and second in the world.]]

Since the 1980s, the road and rail network of Greece has been significantly modernized. Important works include the [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|Egnatia Odos]] that connects northwestern Greece ([[Igoumenitsa]]) with northern and northeastern Greece ([[Kipoi, Evros|Kipoi]]). The [[RioâAntirrio bridge]], the longest suspension cable bridge in Europe, (2250&amp;nbsp;m or 7382&amp;nbsp;ft long) connects the western Peloponnese from [[Rio, Greece|Rio]](7&amp;nbsp;km or 4&amp;nbsp;mi from [[Patras]]) with [[Antirrio]] in Central Greece.

An expansion of the Patras-Athens motorway towards [[Pyrgos, Ilia|Pyrgos]] in the western Peloponnese is scheduled to be completed by 2014. Most of the motorway connection from Athens to Thessaloniki has also been upgraded.

The [[Athens]] Metropolitan Area includes state of the art infrastructure such as the [[Athens International Airport]], the privately run motorway [[Attiki Odos]] and the expanded [[Athens Metro]] system. Most of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connected by air mainly from the two major Greek airlines, [[Olympic Air]] and [[Aegean Airlines]]. Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including [[hydrofoils]] and [[catamarans]]. 

Railway connections play a somewhat lesser role than in many other European countries, but they too have also been expanded, with new suburban/commuter rail connections, serviced by [[Proastiakos]] around [[Athens]], towards its airport, [[Kiato]] and [[Chalcis|Chalkida]]; and around [[Thessaloniki]], towards the cities of [[Larissa]] and [[Edessa]]. A modern intercity rail connection between Athens and Thessaloniki has also been established, while an upgrade to double lines in many parts of the {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}} network is underway. International railway lines connect Greek cities with the rest of Europe, the [[Balkans]] and [[Turkey]], although {{as of|lc=y|2011}} they have been suspended, due to the financial crisis.

===Communications===

In 2003, public spending on [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) was 456.37 million euros (12.6% increase from 2002). Total R&amp;D spending (both public and private) as a percentage of GDP had increased considerably since the beginning of the past decade, from 0.38% in 1989, to 0.65% in 2001. R&amp;D spending in Greece remained lower than the EU average of 1.93%, but, according to Research DC, based on OECD and Eurostat data, between 1990 and 1998, total R&amp;D expenditure in Greece enjoyed the third-highest increase in Europe, after [[Finland]] and Ireland. Because of its strategic location, qualified workforce and political and economic stability, many multinational companies such as [[Ericsson]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Motorola]] and [[Coca-Cola]] have their regional research and development headquarters in Greece.

Greece's technology parks with incubator facilities include [http://www.stepc.gr/ the Science and Technology Park of Crete] (Heraklion), the [http://www.thestep.gr/ Thessaloniki Technology Park], the [http://www.ltp.ntua.gr/ Lavrio Technology Park] and the [http://www.psp.org.gr/apps/en/spag/ Patras Science Park]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}.Greece has been a member of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) since 2005.&lt;ref name = ESA/&gt; Cooperation between ESA and the Hellenic National Space Committee began in the early 1990s. In 1994 Greece and ESA signed their first cooperation agreement. Having formally applied for full membership in 2003, Greece became the ESA's sixteenth member on 16 March 2005. As member of the ESA, Greece participates in the agency's telecommunication and technology activities, and the [[Global Monitoring for Environment and Security]]Initiative.

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Greece|Greeks}}
The official statistical body of Greece is the [[Hellenic Statistical Authority]] (ELSTAT). According to the ELSTAT, Greece's total population in 2001 was 10,964,020.&lt;ref name=&quot;nssg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gr/eng_tables/hellas_in_numbers_eng.pdf|title=Greece in Numbers | publisher=[[Hellenic Statistical Authority]] |year=2006|accessdate=14 December 2007|format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]; requires [[Adobe Acrobat|Adobe Reader]] | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20071124142319/http://www.statistics.gr/eng_tables/hellas_in_numbers_eng.pdf|archivedate = 24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That figure is divided into 5,427,682 males and 5,536,338 females.&lt;ref name=nssg/&gt; The preliminary results of the 2011 census show a decrease in the country's population to 10,787,690, a drop of 1.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011census&quot; /&gt; As statistics from 1971, 1981, and 2001 show, the Greek population has been aging the past several decades.&lt;ref name=nssg/&gt; 

The birth rate in 2003 stood 9.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (14.5 per 1,000 in 1981). At the same time the mortality rate increased slightly from 8.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2003. In 2001, 16.71% of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12% between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18% were 14 years old and younger.&lt;ref name=nssg/&gt;

Greek society has also rapidly changed with the passage of time. Marriage rates kept falling from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 until 2002, only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004.&lt;ref name=nssg/&gt; Divorce rates on the other hand, have seen an increase â from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004.&lt;ref name=nssg/&gt;

===Cities===
Almost two-thirds of the [[Greeks|Greek people]] live in urban areas. Greece's largest metropolitan centres and most influential urban areas, are those of [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]], with metropolitan populations of approximately 4 million and 1 million inhabitants respectively. A number of cities that also form influential urban centres around the country include those of [[Patras]], [[Heraklion]], [[Larissa]], [[Volos]], [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]], [[Ioannina]], [[Chania]] and [[Chalcis]] with urban populations above 100,000 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;cities&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gr/Athena2001/Athena2001.ASP?wcu=$cmd=0$id=5200712142356520314915|title=Athena 2001 Census | publisher=[[National Statistical Service of Greece]]|accessdate=14 December 2007 | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080117231653/http://www.statistics.gr/Athena2001/Athena2001.ASP?wcu=$cmd=0$id=5200712142356520314915| archivedate = 17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below lists the largest cities in Greece, by population contained in their respective contiguous built up urban areas; which are either made up of many municipalities, evident in the cases of Athens and Thessaloniki, or are contained within a larger single municipality, case evident in most of the smaller cities of the country. The results come from the population census that took place in Greece in May 2011.

In 1986 legal and unauthorized immigrants totaled approximately 90,000. A study from the [http://www.mmo.gr mmo.gr Mediterranean Migration Observatory] maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship, constituting around 7% of total population. Of the non-citizen residents, 48,560 were EU or [[European Free Trade Association]] nationals and 17,426 were Cypriots with privileged status. The majority come from Eastern European countries: Albania (56%), Bulgaria (5%) and Romania (3%), while migrants from the former Soviet Union (Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, etc.) comprise 10% of the total.&lt;ref&gt;Kasimis, Charalambos; Kassimi, Chryssa (June 2004).

Greece, together with [[Italy]] and Spain, faces a flood of illegal immigrants trying to enter the EU.

The first concrete evidence of the Greek language dates back to 15th century BC and the [[Linear B]] script which is associated with the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Civilization]]. Greek was a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean world and beyond during [[Classical Antiquity]], and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire. During the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as [[Greek language question]], on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic [[Katharevousa]], created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the [[Dimotiki]], the form of the [[Greek language]] which evolved naturally from [[Byzantine Greek language|Byzantine Greek]] and was the language of the people. The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and [[Katharevousa]] fell to disuse.

Greece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Greek genocide]] and constitute a sizable group.

[[File:Greece linguistic minorities.svg|thumb|left|200px|Regions with a traditional presence of languages other than Greek. Today, Greek is the dominant language throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;See Ethnologue {{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=GR&amp;seq=10 |title=Languages of Greece |publisher=ethnologue.com |accessdate=19 December 2010 }}; Euromosaic, ''Le (slavo)macÃ©donien / bulgare en GrÃ¨ce'', ''L'arvanite / albanais en GrÃ¨ce'', ''Le valaque/aromoune-aroumane en GrÃ¨ce'', and Mercator-Education: European Network for Regional or Minority Languages and Education, ''The Turkish language in education in Greece''. cf. also P.

The [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks]])&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (2000). &quot;Greece and European Turkey: From Religious to Linguistic Identity&quot;, in S Barbour, C Carmichael (eds.).''Language and Nationalism in Europe''.  [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Romani language|Romani]]. Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority. Today they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction. This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians|Moglenites]], also known as [[Vlachs]], whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountaneous central Greece. Members of these groups ethnically identify as Greeks&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.html?type=html&amp;serial=1044526702223 Greek Helsinki Monitor]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}, Minority Rights Group, Greece, Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention) 8 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and are today all at least bilingual in Greek.

Compulsory education in Greece comprises primary schools (ÎÎ·Î¼Î¿ÏÎ¹ÎºÏ Î£ÏÎ¿Î»ÎµÎ¯Î¿, ''DimotikÃ³ Scholeio'') and [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (ÎÏÎ¼Î½Î¬ÏÎ¹Î¿). Nursery schools (Î Î±Î¹Î´Î¹ÎºÏÏ ÏÏÎ±Î¸Î¼ÏÏ, ''PaidikÃ³s StathmÃ³s'') are popular but not compulsory. [[Kindergarten]]s (ÎÎ·ÏÎ¹Î±Î³ÏÎ³ÎµÎ¯Î¿, ''NipiagogeÃ­o'') are now compulsory for any child above 4 years of age. Children start primary school aged 6 and remain there for six years. Attendance at gymnasia starts at age 12 and last for three years.

Greece's post-compulsory secondary education consists of two school types: unified upper secondary schools (ÎÎ½Î¹Î±Î¯Î¿ ÎÏÎºÎµÎ¹Î¿, ''Eniaia Lykeia'') and [[technical school|technical]]â[[vocational school|vocational]] educational schools (Î¤ÎµÏÎ½Î¹ÎºÎ¬ ÎºÎ±Î¹ ÎÏÎ±Î³Î³ÎµÎ»Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¬ ÎÎºÏÎ±Î¹Î´ÎµÏÏÎ®ÏÎ¹Î±, &quot;TEE&quot;). Post-compulsory secondary education also includes vocational training institutes (ÎÎ½ÏÏÎ¹ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ± ÎÏÎ±Î³Î³ÎµÎ»Î¼Î±ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ®Ï ÎÎ±ÏÎ¬ÏÏÎ¹ÏÎ·Ï, &quot;IEK&quot;) which provide a formal but unclassified level of education. As they can accept both ''Gymnasio'' (lower secondary school) and ''Lykeio'' (upper secondary school) graduates, these institutes are not classified as offering a particular level of education.

Public higher education is divided into universities, &quot;Highest Educational Institutions&quot; (ÎÎ½ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ± ÎÎºÏÎ±Î¹Î´ÎµÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¬ ÎÎ´ÏÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ±, ''AnÃ³tata EkpaideytikÃ¡ IdrÃ½mata'', &quot;ÎÎÎ&quot;) and &quot;Highest Technological Educational Institutions&quot; (ÎÎ½ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ± Î¤ÎµÏÎ½Î¿Î»Î¿Î³Î¹ÎºÎ¬ ÎÎºÏÎ±Î¹Î´ÎµÏÏÎ¹ÎºÎ¬ ÎÎ´ÏÏÎ¼Î±ÏÎ±,''AnÃ³tata TechnologikÃ¡ EkpaideytikÃ¡ IdrÃ½mata'', &quot;ATEI&quot;). Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of ''Lykeio''. Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the [[Hellenic Open University]] through a form of lottery. The [[National and Capodistrian University of Athens|Capodistrian university of Athens]] is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean.

The Greek education system also provides special kindergartens, primary and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning. Specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological and physical education also exist.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Greece|List of Greeks}}
[[File:Amphitheatre in Epidavros.jpg|thumb|The ancient theatre of [[Epidaurus]] continues to be used for staging ancient Greek plays.]]
The culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in [[Mycenaean Greece]], continuing most notably into [[Classical Greece]], through the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and its [[Greek East]]ern successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other cultures and states such as [[Frankokratia|Latin and Frankish states]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Venetian Republic]], [[Genoese Republic]], and [[British Empire]] have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, but historians credit the [[Greek War of Independence]] with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single entity of its multi-faceted culture.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}
Most western philosophical traditions began in ancient Greece in the 6th century BC.The first philosophers are called &quot;Presocratics&quot; which designates that they came before Socrates. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of the original writings of the presocratics survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.

A new period of philosophy started with [[Socrates]]. Like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.

[[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]], the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity but while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/greekphi.htm  |title=Greek philosophy from the Internet encyclopedia of philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thermopyles.jpg|thumb|upright|The manuscript of the poem &quot;Thermopyles&quot; (ÎÎµÏÎ¼Î¿ÏÏÎ»ÎµÏ) by [[Constantine P. Cavafy]]. Cavafy's poems are, typically, concise but intimate evocations of real or literary figures and ''milieux'' that have played roles in Greek culture. He is considered probably the greatest modern Greek poet.]]

The timeline of the Greek literature can be separated into three big periods: the ancient, the Byzantine and the modern Greek literature.

At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of [[Homer]]: the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800&amp;nbsp;BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. [[Lyrical poetry]], [[ode]]s, [[pastorals]], [[elegy|elegies]], [[epigrams]]; dramatic presentations of comedy and [[tragedy]];[[historiography]], [[rhetorical]] treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period.The two major lyrical poets were [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]].
The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.

[[File:Solomos portrait 2.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Dionysios Solomos]] wrote the ''[[Hymn to Liberty]]'', which became later the national anthem.]]
[[File:Adamantios Korais.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Adamantios Korais]]]]

Of the hundreds of [[tragedies]] written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The surviving plays by [[Aristophanes]] are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are two of the most influential historians in this period.
The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.

[[Byzantine literature]] refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]], and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the Christian [[Middle Ages]].

[[Modern Greek literature]] refers to literature written in common Modern Greek, emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century AD. The Cretan Renaissance poem''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature. It is a verse [[romance (genre)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]](1553â1613). Later, during the period of [[Diafotismos|Greek enlightenment (Diafotismos)]], writers such as [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] will prepare with their works the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] (1821â1830).

===Cinema===

[[File:John Malkovich press conference, TIFF 2007.jpg|thumb|Press conference at the [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]].]]

Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907. In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films begun. ''Golfo'' (ÎÎºÏÎ»ÏÏ), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''ÎÎ¬ÏÎ½Î¹Ï ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î§Î»ÏÎ·''), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema. In 1944 [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.

The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Greek Golden age of Cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]], [[Irene Papas]] etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements . Notable films were ''Î ÎºÎ¬Î»ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ· Î»Î¯ÏÎ±'' (1955 directed by [[Giorgos Tzavelas]]), ''Î Î¹ÎºÏÏ Î¨ÏÎ¼Î¯'' (1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), ''[[O Drakos]]'' (1956 directed by [[Nikos Koundouros]]), ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955 directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed ''Zorba the Greek'' with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. [[Finos Film]] also contributed to this period with movies such as ''ÎÎ±ÏÎ­ÏÎ½Î±, Î¦ÏÏÏÎµÎ¹Î± ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î¦Î¹Î»ÏÏÎ¹Î¼Î¿'', ''Î ÎÎµÎ¯Î± Î±ÏÏ ÏÎ¿ Î£Î¹ÎºÎ¬Î³Î¿'', ''Î¤Î¿ Î¾ÏÎ»Î¿ Î²Î³Î®ÎºÎµ Î±ÏÏ ÏÎ¿Î½ Î Î±ÏÎ¬Î´ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¿'' and many more. During the 1970s and 1980s [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].

There were also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora such as the Greek-American [[Elia Kazan]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Greek cuisine}}
[[File:GreekSalad.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Greek salad]] with additional ingredients.]]

[[Greek cuisine]] is as an example of the healthy [[Mediterranean diet]] ([[Cretan diet]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sari Edelstein &quot;Food, Cuisine, and Cultural Competency for Culinary, Hospitality, and Nutrition Professionals&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=lj0CeaIIETkC&amp;pg=PA147&amp;dq=Greek+Cuisine:+A+Cultural+History&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WC1MTY72M8Sblgf2nYTiDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Greek%20Cuisine&amp;f=false(pg.147â149)]&lt;/ref&gt; Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as [[moussaka]], [[stifado]], [[Greek salad]], [[spanakopita]] and [[souvlaki]]. Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like [[skordalia]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} (a thick purÃ©e of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[retsina]] (white or rosÃ© wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as [[meze]] with various dips such as [[tzatziki]], grilled octopus and small fish, [[feta cheese]], [[dolmades]](rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various [[pulses]], [[olive]]s and cheese. [[Olive oil]] is added to almost every dish.

Sweet desserts such as [[galaktoboureko]], and drinks such as [[ouzo]], [[metaxa]] and a variety of wines including [[retsina]]. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines: [[oregano]], [[Mentha|mint]], garlic, onion, [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]]seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use &quot;sweet&quot; spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]] and [[cloves]] in stews.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Greece}}
[[File:Mikis2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mikis Theodorakis]], one of the most popular Greek songwriters.]]

Greek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Middle East and the [[Byzantine Empire]] had also effect on Greek music.

While the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change. Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.

[[File:Sfakia-dance.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cretan]] dancers of traditional music.]]

Along with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries A.D. and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, ''paraloghes'' (narrative song or ballad), love songs, [[mantinada|mantinades]], wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.

The [[Heptanese|Heptanesean]] [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kantÃ¡dhes]] (ÎºÎ±Î½ÏÎ¬Î´ÎµÏ '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: ÎºÎ±Î½ÏÎ¬Î´Î±) became the forerunners of the Greek modern song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870â1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades (ÎÎ¸Î·Î½Î±ÏÎºÎ­Ï ÎºÎ±Î½ÏÎ¬Î´ÎµÏ), and the songs performed on stage (ÎµÏÎ¹Î¸ÎµÏÏÎ·ÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ¬ ÏÏÎ±Î³Î¿ÏÎ´Î¹Î± 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revue]], [[operetta]]s and [[nocturne]]s that were dominating Athens' theatre scene.

[[Rebetiko]], initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later [[laÃ¯kÃ³]] (song of the people).

Regarding the classical music, it was through the [[Ionian islands]] (which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], [[Greek language|Greek]]:''ÎÏÏÎ±Î½Î·ÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ® Î£ÏÎ¿Î»Î®''), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Spyridon Samaras]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]. [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the Greek National School.

===Mythology===
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
[[File:Zeus Otricoli Pio-Clementino Inv257.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Zeus]] was the King of the ancient Greek [[dodekatheon]].]]

The numerous gods of the [[ancient Greek religion]] as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek [[epic (genre)|epics]] (''[[The Odyssey]]'' and ''[[The Iliad]]'') and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology. Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the [[ancient Greeks|ancient Greek]] world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.

The principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the [[Dodekatheon]], or the ''Twelve Gods'', who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, who was married to [[Hera]], who was also Zeus's sister. The other Greek gods that made up the [[Twelve Olympians]] were [[Demeter]], [[Hades]], [[Ares]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]] and [[Hermes]]. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as [[nymphs]] and other magical creatures.
