'''Free software''', '''software libre''' or '''libre software''' is [[software]] that can be used, studied, and modified without restriction, and which can be copied and redistributed in modified or unmodified form either without restriction, or with restrictions that only ensure that further recipients can also do these things and that manufacturers of consumer-facing hardware allow user modifications to their hardware. Free software is generally available without charge, but can have a fee, such as in the form of charging for CDs or other distribution media.

In practice, for software to be distributed as free software, the human-readable form of the program (the [[source code]]) must be made available to the recipient along with a notice granting the above permissions.  Such a notice either is a [[free software license]], or a notice that the source code is released into the [[public domain]].

The [[free software movement]] was conceived in 1983 by [[Richard Stallman]] to satisfy the need for and to give the benefit of ''software freedom'' to computer users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html | title = GNU project Initial Announcement }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman founded the [[Free Software Foundation]] in 1985 to provide the organizational structure to advance his Free Software ideas.

From 1998 onward, [[alternative terms for free software]] came into use. The most common are ''software libre'', ''[[free and open source software]]'' (FOSS) and ''free, libre and open source software'' (FLOSS). The Software Freedom Law Center was founded in 2005 to protect and advance FLOSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.softwarefreedom.org | title = Software Freedom Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial software may sometimes offer freedoms which are typical of free and open source software. Contrary to a popular misconception that software is either free or commercial they are unrelated traits, since free software can be commercial and proprietary software can be non-commercial. One example of free commercial software is [[GNAT]], an [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] compiler from the company [[AdaCore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fsfdir&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Service Directory â Free Software Foundation â working together for free software|url=http://www.fsf.org/resources/service|publisher=Free Software Foundation|accessdate=2010-07-06|quote=Founded in 1994, AdaCore is the leading provider of commercial software solutions for Ada, a state-of-the-art programming language designed for large, long-lived applications where safety, security, and reliability are critical. ... We believe [the GNU Project] will best benefit from an open, non- proprietary technology, thus we have made all our [AdaCore's] products free software by adopting the licensing policy of the Free Software Foundation. This means that all components of the GNAT technology, including the run-time, come with sources.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been developed and is available commercially (i.e., against payment), but is ''free'' software because of its non-proprietary nature, with the source code publicly available. On the other hand, ''free software'' and ''proprietary software'' are opposite traits, and an application can be one or the other but never both, contingent upon the availability of the source code under certain minimum freedoms.

Free software, which may or may not be distributed free of charge, is distinct from [[freeware]] which, by definition does not require payment for use.  The authors or copyright holders of freeware may retain all rights to the software; it is not necessarily permissible to  [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]], modify, or redistribute freeware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Since free software may be freely redistributed it is generally available at little or no cost. Free software business models are usually based on adding value such as applications, support, training, customization, integration, or certification. At the same time, some business models which work with [[proprietary software]] are not compatible with free software, such as those that depend on the user to pay for a license in order to lawfully use the software product.

==History==
{{Main|History of free software}}
[[File:Rms ifi large.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Stallman]], the founder of the [[Free Software Movement]]]]
In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, it was normal for computer users to have the ''software freedoms'' associated with free software. [[Software]] was commonly shared by individuals who used computers and by hardware manufacturers who welcomed the fact that people were making software that made their hardware useful. Organizations of users and suppliers, for example, [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]], were formed to facilitate exchange of software.  By the late 1960s, the picture changed: software costs were dramatically increasing, a growing software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products (free in that the cost was included in the hardware cost), leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of &quot;free&quot; software bundled with hardware product costs. In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher| first = Franklin M.| coauthors = McKie, James W.; Mancke, Richard B. | title =IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History | publisher = Praeger | year =1983 | isbn =0-03-063059-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While some software might always be free, there would be a growing amount of software that was for sale only. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the [[software industry]] began using technical measures (such as only distributing [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer programs]]) to prevent [[computer users]] from being able to study and modify software. In 1980 [[copyright]] law was extended to computer programs.

In 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the [[GNU project]], saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users. Software development for the [[GNU operating system]] began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. He developed a free software definition and the concept of &quot;[[copyleft]]&quot;, designed to ensure ''software freedom'' for all.

The economic viability of free software has been recognized by large corporations such as [[IBM]], [[Red Hat]], and [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/news/1999/03/02.phtml |title=IBM launches biggest Linux lineup ever |date=1999-03-02 |publisher=IBM |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19991110114228/http://www.ibm.com/news/1999/03/02.phtml |archivedate=1999-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM invests in Brazil Linux Tech Center|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/185602/|date=2006-05-24|publisher=[[LWN.net]]|author=Farrah Hamid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-erick.html|title=Interview: The Eclipse code donation|date=2001-11-01|publisher=IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also, some non-software industries are beginning to use techniques similar to those used in free software development for their research and development process; scientists, for example, are looking towards more open development processes, and hardware such as microchips are beginning to be developed with specifications released under [[copyleft]] licenses (see the [[OpenCores]] project, for instance). [[Creative Commons]] and the [[free culture movement]] have also been largely influenced by the free software movement.

===Naming===
The FSF recommends using the term &quot;free software&quot; rather than &quot;[[open source software]]&quot; because, they state in a paper on Free Software philosophy, the latter term and the associated marketing campaign focuses on the technical issues of software development, avoiding the issue of user freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html | title = Why &quot;Open Source&quot; misses the point of Free Software | quote = The philosophy of open source, with its purely practical values, impedes understanding of the deeper ideas of free software; it brings many people into our community, but does not teach them to defend it. }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[wikt:libre|Libre]]&quot; is often used to avoid the ambiguity of the word &quot;free&quot; in [[English language]]; see [[Gratis versus libre|''Gratis'' versus ''libre'']]. &lt;!-- someone should add a note here explaining how others disagree and that &quot;open source&quot; is better because that is what the licenses have in common. For example the GPL is often cited as free when only the FSF views as &quot;free&quot; not everyone. But everyone agrees that it is open source --&gt;

==Definition==
{{Main|The Free Software Definition|Debian Free Software Guidelines|Open Source Definition}}

The first formal definition of free software was published by FSF in February 1986.&lt;ref name=bull6&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt
|title=GNU's Bulletin, Volume 1 Number 1, page 8
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That definition, written by Richard Stallman, is still maintained today and states that software is free software if people who receive a copy of the software have the following four freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=FSF: The four freedoms |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The numbering begins with zero since many computer systems use [[zero-based numbering]].)
* Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.
* Freedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
* Freedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
* Freedom 3: The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

Freedoms 1 and 3 require [[source code]] to be available because studying and modifying software without its source code is highly impractical.

Thus, free software means that [[computer user]]s have the freedom to cooperate with whom they choose, and to control the software they use.  To summarize this into a remark distinguishing ''libre'' (freedom) software from ''[[gratis]]'' (zero price) software, the Free Software Foundation says: &quot;Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in '[[freedom of speech|free speech]]', not as in 'free beer{{'&quot;}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=The Free Software Definition |author=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Gratis versus libre|''Gratis'' versus ''libre'']].

In the late 1990s, other groups published their own definitions which describe an almost identical set of software.  The most notable are [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]] published in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|author=Bruce Perens
|url=http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/debian-announce-1997/msg00017.html
|title=Debian's &quot;Social Contract&quot; with the Free Software Community
|work=debian-announce mailing list
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Open Source Definition]], published in 1998.

The [[BSD (operating system)|BSD]]-based operating systems, such as [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[NetBSD]], do not have their own formal definitions of free software.  Users of these systems generally find the same set of software to be acceptable, but sometimes see copyleft as restrictive.  They generally advocate [[permissive free software licenses]], which allow others to use the software as they wish, without being legally ''forced'' to provide the source code.  Their view is that this permissive approach is more free.  The [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], [[X11 license|X11]], and [[Apache License|Apache]] software licenses are substantially similar in intent and implementation.  &lt;!--While true - it isn't of all free software and is not needed in the article. leaving this as a comment so others can fix:::: All of these software packages originated in academic institutions interested in wide technology transfer ([[University of California]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|UIUC]]).--&gt;

==Examples of free software==

{{Main|List of free and open source software packages}}

The [[Free Software Directory]] maintains a large database of free software packages.  Some of the best-known examples include the [[Linux Kernel]], the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and GNU/Linux operating systems, the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] and [[GNU C Library|C library]]; the [[MySQL]] relational database; the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] web server; and the [[Sendmail]] mail transport agent.  Other influential examples include the [[emacs]] text editor; the [[GIMP]] raster drawing and image editor; the [[X Window System]] graphical-display system; the [[LibreOffice]] office suite; and the [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]] typesetting systems. It should be noted that not everyone agrees that all these are purely free software. Some{{Who?|date=November 2011}} view GPL software as non free and others view freedom on a scale with GPL being less free than copy-free (permissive) licenses and as such nothing is either &quot;free&quot; or &quot;non-free&quot;.

==Free software licenses==
{{Main|Free software license}}
All free software licenses must grant users all the freedoms discussed above. However, unless the applications' licenses are compatible, combining programs by mixing source code or directly linking binaries is problematic, because of license technicalities. Programs indirectly connected together may avoid this problem.

The majority of free software falls under a small set of licenses. The most popular of these licenses are:
* the [[GNU General Public License]]
* the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]]
* the [[BSD License]]
* the [[Mozilla Public License]]
* the [[MIT License]]
* the [[Apache License]]

The Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative both publish lists of licenses that they find to comply with their own definitions of free software and open-source software respectively.
* [[List of FSF-approved software licenses|List of FSF approved software licenses]]
* [[Open-source license|List of OSI approved software licenses]]

The FSF list is not prescriptive: free licenses can exist which the FSF has not heard about, or considered important enough to write about. So it's possible for a license to be free and not in the FSF list. The OSI list only lists licenses that have been submitted, considered and approved. All Open Source licenses must meet the [[Open Source Definition]] in order to be officially recognized as open source software.  Free software on the other hand is a more informal classification that does not rely on official recognition.  Nevertheless, software licensed under licenses that do not meet the Free Software Definition cannot rightly be considered free software.

Apart from these two organizations, the [[Debian]] project is seen by some to provide useful advice on whether particular licenses comply with their [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]].  Debian doesn't publish a list of ''approved'' licenses, so its judgments have to be tracked by checking what software they have allowed into their software archives. That is summarized at the Debian web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/ |title=Debian -- License information |accessdate=2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rare that a license announced as being in-compliance with the FSF guidelines does not also meet the [[Open Source Definition]], although the reverse is not necessarily true (for example, the [[NASA Open Source Agreement]] is an OSI-approved licenses, but non-free according to FSF)

===Different types of licenses===
There are different categories of free software.

* [[Public domain]] software â the copyright has expired, the work was not copyrighted, or the author has released the software onto the public domain (in countries where this is possible). Since public-domain software lacks copyright protection, it may be freely incorporated into any work, whether proprietary or free.

* [[permissive free software licences|Permissive licenses]], also called BSD-style because they are applied to much of the software distributed with the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] operating systems. These licenses are also known as copyfree as they have no restrictions on distribution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://copyfree.org/ Copyfree: Unfetter your ideas]&lt;/ref&gt;  The author retains copyright solely to disclaim warranty and require proper attribution of modified works, and permits redistribution and '''any''' modification, even closed source ones.

* [[Copyleft]] licenses, with the [[GNU General Public License]] being the most prominent. The author retains copyright and permits redistribution under the restriction that all such redistribution is licensed under the same license. Additions and modifications by others must also be licensed under the same &quot;copyleft&quot; license whenever they are distributed with part of the original licensed product. This is also known as a [[Viral license]]. Due to the restriction on distribution not everyone considers this type of license to be free.&lt;ref&gt;[https://noordering.wordpress.com/2009/01/20/why-the-gpl-is-not-free/ Noordering.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendevice.blogspot.com/2007/06/best-gnu-gpl-vs-bsd-comparison-ever.html Opendevice.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this last one 404ed at the original source so a quoted copy works --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charvolant.org/~doug/gpl/html/index.html Charvolant.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.sunsetbrew.com/2010/02/gpl-is-not-open-source.html Blog.sunsetbrew.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security and reliability==
There is debate over the [[computer security|security]] of free software in comparison to proprietary software, with a major issue being [[security through obscurity]]. A popular quantitative test in computer security is to use relative counting of known unpatched security flaws. Generally, users of this method advise avoiding products which lack fixes for known security flaws, at least until a fix is available.

Free software advocates say that this method is biased by counting more vulnerabilities for the free software, since its source code is accessible and its community is more forthcoming about what problems exist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-6047727-7.html | title = Firefox more secure than MSIE after all | publisher = News.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is called &quot;Security Through Public Disclosure&quot; by some) and proprietary software can have undisclosed flaws discoverable by or known to malicious users. As users can analyse and trace the source code, many more people with no commercial constraints can inspect the code and find bugs and loopholes than a corporation would find practicable.  According to Richard Stallman, user access to the source code makes deploying free software with undesirable hidden [[spyware]] functionality far more difficult than for proprietary software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsfeurope.org/documents/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#freedom-one|title=Transcript where Stallman explains about spyware}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As examples, he named two aspects of [[Windows XP]] that reveal information to [[Microsoft]], which were discovered in spite of the estimated 50 million or more [[Source lines of code|lines of Windows code]] having not been available to individual users for personal auditing.

Some quantitative studies have been done on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Wheeler: [http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html#security Why Open Source Software / Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, or FOSS)? Look at the Numbers!] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Delio: [http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2004/12/66022 Linux: Fewer Bugs Than Rivals] Wired.com 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selling free software==
Selling Software under the BSD license is permissible and commercial use of the project is part of the intent of the license.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html Linfo.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/bsdl-gpl/article.html Freebsd.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free Software Foundation encourages selling free software. Quote &quot;Distributing free software is an opportunity to raise funds for development. Don't waste it!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html Selling Free Software] gnu.org&lt;/ref&gt; For example the [[GNU GPL]] which is the Free Software Foundation's license states that &quot;[the user] may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html#section4 GNU General Public License, section 4.] gnu.org&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misbelief however that consumers shouldn't or aren't allowed to redistribute software under the GPL for profit,{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} and some opposing parties state such notions. For example Microsoft CEO [[Ballmer|Steve Ballmer]] stated in 2001 that &quot;Open source is not available to commercial companies. The way the license is written, if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20010615205548/http://suntimes.com/output/tech/cst-fin-micro01.html Ballmer calling open source a 'cancer', saying it's &quot;not available to commercial companies&quot;] Chicago Sun-Times, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When you distribute software under the GPL, you must provide the source code as well and must allow others to distribute it. Yet there are large companies, e.g. [[Red Hat]] and [[IBM]], which succeed in doing it.

==Commercial viability and adoption==
Free software played a significant part in the development of the Internet, the World Wide Web and the infrastructure of [[dot-com companies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Web Server Survey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html |title=Web Server Usage Survey |author=Netcraft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apache Strategy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~mohrmana/apache.pdf |title=Apache Strategy in the New Economy |author=The Apache Software Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free software allows users to cooperate in enhancing and refining the programs they use; free software is a [[pure public good]] rather than a [[private good]]. Companies that contribute to free software can increase commercial [[innovation]] amidst the void of [[patent]] [[cross licensing]] lawsuits. (See [[Mpeg2#Patent holders|mpeg2 patent holders]].)

Under the free software business model, free software vendors may charge a fee for distribution and offer pay support and software customization services. Proprietary software uses a different business model, where a customer of the proprietary software pays a fee for a license to use the software. This license may grant the customer the ability to configure some or no parts of the software themselves. Often some level of support is included in the purchase of proprietary software, but additional support services (especially for enterprise applications) are usually available for an additional fee. Some proprietary software vendors will also customize software for a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Andy Dornan|title = The Five Open Source Business Models|url = http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/01/the_five_open_s.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free software is generally available at no cost and can result in permanently lower costs compared to [[proprietary software]]. With free software, businesses can fit software to their specific needs by changing the software themselves or by hiring programmers to modify it for them.  Free software often has no warranty, and more importantly, generally does not assign legal liability to anyone. However, warranties are permitted between any two parties upon the condition of the software and its usage. Such an agreement is made separately from the free software license.

A report by Standish Group estimates that adoption of free software has caused a drop in revenue to the [[proprietary software]] industry by about $60 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standishgroup.com/newsroom/open_source.php |title=Standish Newsroom - Open Source |publisher=Standishgroup.com |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Binary blobs===
In 2006, [[OpenBSD]] started the first campaign against the use of [[binary blob]]s, in [[kernel (computing)|kernels]]. Blobs are usually freely distributable [[device driver]]s for hardware from vendors that do not reveal driver source code to users or developers. This restricts the users' freedom effectively to modify the software and distribute modified versions. Also, since the blobs are undocumented and may have [[software bug|bugs]], they pose a security risk to any [[operating system]] whose kernel includes them. The proclaimed aim of the campaign against blobs is to collect hardware documentation that allows developers to write free software drivers for that hardware, ultimately enabling all free operating systems to become or remain blob-free.

The issue of binary blobs in the [[Linux kernel]] and other device drivers motivated some developers in Ireland to launch [[gNewSense]], a GNU/Linux based distribution with all the binary blobs removed. The project received support from the [[Free Software Foundation]] and stimulated the creation, headed by the [[Free Software Foundation Latin America]], of the [[Linux-libre]] kernel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/links/links.html#FreeGNULinuxDistributions [[GNU/Linux]] distributions we know of which consist entirely of free software, and whose main distribution sites distribute only free software.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===BitKeeper===
{{Main|BitKeeper#License concerns}}

[[Larry McVoy]] invited high-profile free software projects to use his proprietary [[distributed version control system]], [[BitKeeper]], free of charge, in order to attract paying users. In 2002, Linux coordinator [[Linus Torvalds]] decided to use BitKeeper to develop the [[Linux kernel]], a free software project, claiming no free software alternative met his needs. This controversial decision drew criticism from several sources, including the Free Software Foundation's founder Richard Stallman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Richard Stallman thanking Larry McVoy for ending the gratis licenses for BitKeeper | url = http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/04/25/130207 | publisher = [[NewsForge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the apparent [[reverse engineering]] of BitKeeper's protocols, McVoy withdrew permission for gratis use by free software projects.  Linus Torvalds quickly developed a free software replacement called [[Git (software)|Git]], while fellow Linux kernel contributor Matt Mackall developed another free software replacement called [[Mercurial (software)|Mercurial]].  The Linux kernel eventually settled on Git for its own development process, while some other free software projects have chosen Mercurial.

In November 2006, the [[Microsoft]] and [[Novell]] software corporations announced a controversial partnership involving, among other things, patent protection for some customers of Novell under certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ars Technica article on the Microsoft-Novell patent deal | url = http://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/linux/linux-20070128.ars }}&lt;/ref&gt; FSF included as a result of this deal conditions in the GPL to prevent deals like it in the future. &lt;ref&gt;[http://gplv3.fsf.org/dd3-faq GPLv3 FAQ], accessed May 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Eric S. Raymond]] argues that the term ''free software'' is too ambiguous and intimidating for the business community. Raymond promotes the term ''[[open source software]]'' as a more friendly alternative for the business and corporate world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Eric S. Raymond's initial call to start using the term open source software, instead of free software | url = http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html | author = Eric S. Raymond }}&lt;/ref&gt;
