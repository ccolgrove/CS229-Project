{{Demographics and culture of Hong Kong}}
'''Hong Kong people''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{lang|zh|é¦æ¸¯äºº}}) refer to people who originate from [[Hong Kong]]. The term (and its Chinese equivalent) has no legal definition in Hong Kong. Rather, terms such as ''Hong Kong permanent resident ({{lang|zh|é¦æ¸¯æ°¸ä¹æ§å±æ°}})'' and ''Hong Kong resident ({{lang|zh|é¦æ¸¯å±æ°}})'' are used. Besides being used by Hong Kong residents, the term Hong Konger may be used by people who for one reason or another do not have legal residence status but spent an extensive period of time in Hong Kong or otherwise have a strong cultural connection with Hong Kong. Thus the term is largely open to personal interpretation. None of the terms make reference to the ethnicity of a person and are independent of [[China|Chinese]] citizenship or residency statuses.

==Terminology==
The vast majority of Hong Kong Chinese have ancestral roots from [[Guangdong Province]] in mainland China. After all, the SAR had experienced a great exodus of people in the years leading up to the handover, and yet migration from mainland China in recent years have brought about migrants who would prefer to refer themselves as Chinese. Many locals however simply refer themselves as Hong Kong people (HÃ¨ung GÃ³ng YÃ hn).

===Variation===
The terms '''Hong Konger''' (or '''Hongkonger'''), '''Hongkongese''', and '''Hong Kong People''' are all translated into the [[Cantonese]] term of ''HÃ¨ung GÃ³ng YÃ hn'' ({{zh|c=é¦æ¸¯äºº|cy=HÃ¨ung GÃ³ng YÃ hn}}). As a result, the above terms are different only as far as English language usage is concerned. People from Hong Kong in Western countries are also referred to colloquially as '''Hongers'''{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} (or '''honkies'''{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}, an offensive term ), however these latter terms are not always well received.  The terms embodies a civic identity as opposed to one based upon race or ethnicity.

'''Hong Konger''' is used more often by native speakers of English,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} while '''Hong Kong People''', a more direct translation of the term HÃ¨ung GÃ³ng YÃ hn, is used to a greater extent by Chinese [[native speaker]]s in Hong Kong when writing or speaking in English.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} '''Hongkongese''' is a relatively recent term coined by the [[North America]]n press, likely using the same suffix as the word ''Chinese'' does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|id= {{hdl|2027/spo.4750978.0005.107}}|date=1997 fall|publisher=[[University of Michigan]] University Library ''Journal of the International Institution''|title=Hong Kong Handover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Hong Kong Chinese''' was used more often in the [[colonial Hong Kong|19th to early 20th century in Hong Kong]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, where the British population residing in Hong Kong made up a higher percentage than what it comprises now. One used to refer to an individual as Hong Kong Chinese in order to differentiate the person from a [[Britons in Hong Kong|Hong Kong Briton]].

===Legal definition of Hong Kong residents===
The [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] legally gives precise definition of Hong Kong residents. Under Article 24 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong residents can be further classified as non-permanent or permanent residents. Non-permanent residents are those who have the right to hold a [[Hong Kong Identity Card]] but have no right of abode. On the contrary, permanent residents are those who have the right to hold a Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card and the right of abode in Hong Kong.

Article 24 of the Basic Law provides:
{{cquote|Residents of the [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] (&quot;Hong Kong residents&quot;) shall include permanent residents and non-permanent residents.

The permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be:

#	 Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;
#	 Chinese citizens who have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;
#	 Persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of those residents listed in categories (1) and (2);
#	 Persons not of Chinese nationality who have entered Hong Kong with valid travel documents, have ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years and have taken Hong Kong as their place of permanent residence before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region;
#	 Persons under 21 years of age born in Hong Kong of those residents listed in category (4) before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; and
#	 Persons other than those residents listed in categories (1) to (5), who, before the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, had the right of abode in Hong Kong only.

The above-mentioned residents shall have the right of abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and shall be qualified to obtain, in accordance with the laws of the Region, permanent identity cards which state their right of abode.

The non-permanent residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be persons who are qualified to obtain Hong Kong identity cards in accordance with the laws of the Region but have no right of abode.}}

==Ethnic groups in Hong Kong==
===Han Chinese===
[[Han Chinese]] make up the majority of Hong Kongers, most being from [[Guangdong]] from the 1930s to the 1980s.  There are also the [[indigenous inhabitants]] of the [[New Territories]].

The majority of the new addition to the population are people from the mainland China{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. Ever since Hong Kong was a British colony, many mainland Chinese have immigrated to Hong Kong, and there is now a daily quota of 150 for those wishing to reside in Hong Kong{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.

[[Cantonese people]] represent the largest group in Hong Kong. Beside the Cantonese, people of other Han Chinese groups also reside in Hong Kong. However, the Cantonese remains the largest group even amongst other Han Chinese groups in Hong Kong. As such, Hong Kong culture is highly Cantonese-influenced. Together with the fact that Cantonese is most commonly used as the language of both everyday and formal conversations, as well as its use in the media and education{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, other Han Chinese groups in Hong Kong, such as the Hakka, the Hoklo (Hokkien), the Shanghainese, or the Teochew, in particular those who are Hong Kong born or raised, often assimilate into the mainstream Cantonese identity of Hong Kong.

===Ethnic minorities===
Hong Kong has a number of minority ethnic and national groups. The [[South Asians in Hong Kong|South Asian community]] ([[Indians in Hong Kong|Indians]], [[Pakistanis in Hong Kong|Pakistanis]], and [[Nepalis in Hong Kong|Nepalis]]) is long-established, and comprises both descendants of 19th and early 20th-century migrants, as well as more recent short term expatriates. Numerically, the largest groups are [[Filipinos in Hong Kong|Filipinos]] and [[Indonesians in Hong Kong|Indonesians]]. Other groups include [[Americans in Hong Kong|Americans]], [[Britons in Hong Kong|Britons]], [[Canadians in Hong Kong|Canadians]], Australians, New Zealanders, [[Japanese in Hong Kong|Japanese]], [[Koreans in Hong Kong|Koreans]], [[Russians in Hong Kong|Russians]], Vietnamese and [[Thais in Hong Kong|Thais]].
