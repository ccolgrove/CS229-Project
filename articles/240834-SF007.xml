<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="240834" ns="0" title="Kylin"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">Named after the mythical beast ''[[qilin]]'', '''Kylin''' ({{zh|s=éºéº}}) is an [[operating system]] developed by academics at the [[National University of Defense Technology]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], and approved for use by the [[People's Liberation Army]]. Based on [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] and [[FreeBSD]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200606/17/eng20060617_275003.html China Peoples Daily ''(Retrieved 13 May 2009)'']&lt;/ref&gt; it aims to add an extra level of security to that operating system. In this sense, it is a similar effort to [[Selinux|Security-Enhanced Linux]] that was originally developed primarily by the U.S. [[National Security Agency]]. The first public version of Kylin was released in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kylin.org.cn Kylin Homepage ''(Retrieved 15 May 2009)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kylin system, as a version of the FreeBSD UNIX-based operating system, is compatible with other mainstream operating systems and supports multiple microprocessors and computers of different structures. 

A report presented to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-technology/china-deploys-secure-computer-operating-system-20090513-b24h.html Sydney Morning Herald ''(Retrieved 13 May 2009)'']&lt;/ref&gt; caused concern by making claims that the purpose of Kylin is to hinder advances of competing countries in the cyberwarfare arena. This report has been heavily criticized as unsubstantiated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://threatchaos.com/home-mainmenu-1/16-blog/53 Threatchaos article ''(Retrieved 12 September 2010)'']&lt;/ref&gt; Kylin has reportedly been deployed in Chinese military and sensitive government organizations since 2007.
