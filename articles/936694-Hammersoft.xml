'''Joanna Newsom''' (born January 18, 1982) is an American [[harpist]], [[pianist]] and [[singer-songwriter]] from [[Nevada City, California]].

== Early life ==
Newsom grew up in the small town of [[Nevada City, California]]. As a child, Newsom was not allowed to watch television or listen to the radio because she was raised by doctors who were &quot;kind of idealists when it came to hoping they could protect us from bad influences, like violent movies, or stupid stuff&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SundayTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article7032768.ece|title=The conversation: Joanna Newsom|last=Heawood|first=Sophie|work=The Sunday Times|date=2010-02-20|accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was exposed to music from a young age. Her father played the guitar and her mother was a classically trained [[piano|pianist]] who played the [[hammered dulcimer]], the [[autoharp]] and [[conga]] drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portable-infinite.blogspot.com/2005/03/joanna-newsom-interview.html |title=First interview, May 2003 |publisher=The Portable Infinite |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/web/unpublished/joanna_newsom.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041223172257/http://www.thewire.co.uk/web/unpublished/joanna_newsom.html |title=The Wire interview |publisher=The Wire|archivedate=2004-12-23 |date=2004-12-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] school where she studied theater and learned to memorize and recite long poems. This skill helps her to remember lyrics while on tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zine |first=Venus |url=http://www.venuszine.com/articles/music/features/2325/Joanna_Newsom |title=Venus Zine interview, December 2006 |publisher=Venuszine.com |date=2006-12-01 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 5, Newsom asked her parents if she could play the harp. Her parents eventually agreed to sign her up for harp lessons, but the local harp teacher did not want to take on such a young student and suggested she learn to play the piano first. Starting at the age of four, she began playing the piano and later the harp, which she &quot;loved from the first lesson onward.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chickfactor.com/current/cf16_joannanewsom.shtml |title=Chickfactor interview, circa 2005 |publisher=Chickfactor.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; From her instructor, Joanna learned composition and improvisation. She learned to play on smaller [[Celtic harp]]s until her parents bought her a full-size [[pedal harp]] in the seventh grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080319032133/http://www.jamiebergerwords.com/html/articles/articles/joannanewsom.htm Joanna Newsom: Donât Call Her A Prodigy. Or Maybe Do.], West Coast Performer, September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  During her teens, she and the instrument became inseparable, and she describes her relationship with the harp as similar to &quot;an artificial limb or a wheelchair. Itâs almost part of me, but more to the point, it serves a purpose, and if it wasnât there I would wonder what was supposed to fit in its place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SundayTimes&quot;/&gt;

She studied composition and creative writing at [[Mills College]] in [[Oakland]], California. While at Mills, she played keyboards in [[The Pleased]]. She dropped out of the school in order to focus on her music.&lt;ref name=&quot;SundayTimes&quot;/&gt;

== Career ==
In 2002 and 2003, Newsom recorded two [[Extended play|EPs]], ''[[Walnut Whales]]'' and ''[[Yarn and Glue]]''. These homemade recordings were intended to serve as a document of her early work; she recorded them on a [[Fisher-Price]] [[tape recorder]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://undertheradarmag.com/newsom.html  |title=Under the Radar |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-13 |accessdate=2010-11-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013111802/http://undertheradarmag.com/newsom.html |archivedate = 2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These EPs were not intended for public distribution. At the suggestion of [[Noah Georgeson]], her boyfriend at the time and the EPs' recorder, she burned several copies to sell at her early shows.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; John Fellman, co-producer of [[Mission Creek Music and Arts Festival]], claims to be the first to have booked a show for her.&lt;ref&gt;Harmanci, Reyhan. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/05/29/PKGDICQH6I52.DTL&amp;type=music &quot;Playing By The Bookings&quot;]. San Francisco Chronicle. May 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A friend of Newsom's passed one of these CDs on to [[Will Oldham]] at a show in Nevada City. Oldham was impressed with Newsom's music and asked her to tour with him. He also gave a copy of the CD to the owner of [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]], his record label. Drag City signed Newsom and released her debut album ''[[The Milk-Eyed Mender]]'' in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20041223172257/http://www.thewire.co.uk/web/unpublished/joanna_newsom.html The Wire], 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Newsom toured with [[Devendra Banhart]] and [[Vetiver (band)|Vetiver]] and made an early UK appearance at the [[Green Man Festival]] in Wales, returning to headline in 2005, 2007 and 2010.

Newsom's work has become prominent on the indie scene. Her profile has risen, in part, due to a number of live shows and appearances on shows like ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

Her second album ''[[Ys (album)|Ys]]'' was released in November 2006. The album features orchestrations and arrangements by [[Van Dyke Parks]], engineering from [[Steve Albini]] and mixing by Drag City label-mate [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]]. On a road trip, [[Bill Callahan (musician)|Bill Callahan]] recommended she listen to the album ''[[Song Cycle (album)|Song Cycle]]'' by Parks, which led to his being chosen to arrange her work on ''Ys''.

Joanna is known to debut songs impromptu at her concerts. On March 28, 2009, she performed over two hours of new material at a 'secret' concert in [[Big Sur|Big Sur, California]] with fellow [[Nevada City, California|Nevada City]] singer-songwriter [[Mariee Sioux]] under the pseudonym 'The Beatles's'. Those in attendance reported that about one-third of her new material was played primarily on piano, with a backing arrangement of banjo, violin, guitar and drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Woolf|first=Devin|title=Joanna Newsom Debuts New Record at Surprise Fernwood Show in Big Sur|newspaper=Naturalismo|date=March 31, 2009|url=http://naturalismo.wordpress.com/2009/03/31/joanna-newsom-played-upcoming-third-album-live-in-full-in-big-sur/|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since late 2006, Joanna has performed a solo harp version of the traditional Scottish song &quot;Ca the Yowes Tae the Knowes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/joanna-newsom-barbican-london--none-onestar-twostar-threestar-fourstar-433358.html |title=Joanna Newsom, Barbican, London &lt;!- none onestar twostar threestar fourstar -&gt; - Reviews, Music |publisher=The Independent |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2009-10-09 | first=Luiza | last=Sauma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the songs on ''[[The Milk-Eyed Mender]]'' have been covered by her peers. &quot;Bridges and Balloons&quot; was covered by [[The Decemberists]] on their 2005 EP ''[[Picaresqueties]]''.  &quot;Sprout and the Bean&quot; has been covered by The Moscow Coup Attempt and [[Sholi]]. &quot;Peach, Plum, Pear&quot; has been covered by Final Fantasy ([[Owen Pallett]]) on the 2006 EP ''[[Young Canadian Mothers]]'', as well as by [[Straylight Run]]. [[M Ward]] has played &quot;Sadie&quot; at some of his live shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV3VlP5q33A |title=M. Ward - &quot;Sadie&quot; live |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-09-07 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, she appeared in the music video for the song &quot;[[Kids (MGMT song)|Kids]]&quot; by the group [[MGMT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Kreps |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/06/04/mgmt-cast-joanna-newsom-kid-monsters-in-kids-video |title=MGMT Cast Joanna Newsom, Kid, Monsters in &quot;Kids&quot; Video : Rolling Stone : Rock and Roll Daily |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 12, 2010, an entry cryptically entitled &quot;@!?*(%$#!!&quot; was posted on the [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]] website.  It contained a link which led to a short comic strip titled &quot;Joanna Newsom 'Have One on Me'&quot; with a date of February 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragcity.com/news/72/ |title=@!?*(%$#!! |publisher=Dragcity.com |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that day, it was confirmed by Spunk, Newsom's Australian label, that the title and date represented the title of Newsom's upcoming album and its release date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.com.au/2010/01/joanna-newsom-have-one-on-me-out-february-19/ Joanna Newsom ''Have One on Me'' Out February 19]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[P-Vine Records]] in Japan announced that ''[[Have One on Me]]'', which was recorded in Tokyo in 2009, would be released in Japan on March 3, 2010, as a 3-disc CD set, with a total of approximately three hours of new recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/arts/live-reports/joanna-newsom/|title=Joanna Newsom: Feb 8, 2010, Scott Hall, Waseda|date=February 9, 2010|publisher=Metropolis Magazine|accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsom was chosen by [[Matt Groening]] to perform at the edition of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival he curated in May 2010 in Minehead, England.

On February 11, 2010,  [[Pitchfork Media]] reported that Newsom would be the subject of a tribute book titled ''Visions of Joanna Newsom'' which has now been published by Roan Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37875-joanna-newsom-gets-her-own-scholarly-tribute-book/ |title=Joanna Newsom Gets Her Own Scholarly Tribute Book |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She toured throughout Europe and America in 2010 to promote her latest record, supported by a five-man band. In December 2010, a tribute album of Newsom covers was released as a digital download. Artists involved include [[M. Ward]], [[Billy Bragg]] and [[Owen Pallett]], with all proceeds going to [[Oxfam]] America's Pakistan Flood Relief Efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.versionsofjoanna.com/ Versions of Joanna&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2011, Newsom's second single, ''What We Have Known'', was released on 12&quot; vinyl. The single was originally the [[b-side]] to her first single, ''[[Sprout and the Bean]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragcity.com/products/what-we-have-known What We Have Known 12'' single release]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, she filmed her second music video (for the song &quot;Good Intentions Paving Company&quot;) with directors Karni &amp; Saul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stereogum.com/733541/photos-from-joanna-newsoms-good-intentions-paving-company-video-shoot/top-stories/lead-story/ Photos From Joanna Newsomâs âGood Intentions Paving Companyâ Video Shoot]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Joanna has been chosen by [[Jeff Mangum]] of [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival that he will curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atpfestival.com/events/jeffmangum.php ATP curated by Jeff Mangum]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Newsom contributed vocals to &quot;The Muppet Show Theme&quot; for ''[[The Muppets (film)|The Muppets]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://stereogum.com/870051/hear-joanna-newsom-feists-muppets-soundtrack-songs/mp3s/comment-page-1/#comment-7499811 Hear Joanna Newsom &amp; Feistâs Muppets Soundtrack Songs]&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared on the cover of the 10th anniversary issue of ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'' with [[Robin Pecknold]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undertheradarmag.com/issues/10134/ Under the Radar magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
Newsom's earlier work was strongly influenced by [[polyrhythm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2006/12/23/nearer-the-heart-of-things-erik-davis-on-joanna-newsom-from-arthur-no-25winter-02006 |title=NEARER THE HEART OF THINGS: Erik Davis on Joanna Newsom (Arthur Magazine) |publisher=Arthurmag.com |date=2006-12-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her harp teacher, Diana Stork, taught her the basic pattern of four beats against three which creates an interlocking, shifting pattern that can be heard on ''[[Ys (album)|Ys]]'', particularly in the middle section of &quot;Sawdust &amp; Diamonds.&quot; After ''Ys'', Newsom said she had lost interest in polyrhythms. They &quot;stopped being fascinating to me and started feeling wanky.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Randall Roberts |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2007-11-15/music/mending-the-gap/ |title=Mending the Gap |publisher=LA Weekly |date=2007-11-07 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media have sometimes labeled her as one of the most prominent members of the modern [[psych folk]] movement. Joanna, however, makes no ties to any particular music scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/pop/10651/ | title=Q&amp;A With Joanna Newsom | author=Rebecca Milzoff | publisher=New York Magazine | month=May | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her songwriting incorporates elements of [[Old-time music|Appalachian music]] and avant-garde modernism.

Newsom's vocal style (in the November 2006 issue of ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' she described her voice as &quot;untrainable&quot;) has shadings of folk and Appalachian shaped-note timbres. Newsom has, however, expressed disappointment at comments that her singing is &quot;child-like.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag&quot; /&gt;

Critics noticed a change in Newsom's voice on her latest album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/reviews/fr/joanna-newsom-have-one-on-me.htm |title=Joanna Newsom Have One On Me - Review of Joanna Newsom's Triple Album Have One On Me |publisher=Altmusic.about.com |date=2010-02-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=09:53am |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/3fd3 |title=Music - Review of Joanna Newsom - Have One on Me |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2009, Newsom developed [[vocal fold nodules|vocal cord nodules]] and could not speak or sing for two months. The recovery from the nodules and further &quot;vocal modifications&quot; changed her voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article7032768.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=The conversation Joanna Newsom | first=Sophie | last=Heawood | date=February 20, 2010 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://looklistenplay.com/haveoneonme |title=Joanna Newsom - Have One On Me (Review) |publisher=Look Listen Play |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newsom |first=Joanna |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123981491 |title=First Listen: Joanna Newsom |publisher=NPR |date=2010-02-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collaborations ==
In addition to her solo work, Newsom has played on records by [[Smog (band)|Smog]], [[Vetiver (band)|Vetiver]], Nervous Cop, The Year Zero, [[Vashti Bunyan]], Moore Brothers, [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], [[Golden Shoulders]] and [[The Roots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vozick |first=Simon |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/04/22/roots-joanna-newsom-john-legend-jim-james/ |title=The Roots enlist Joanna Newsom, John Legend, Jim James for new album &amp;#124; EW.com |publisher=Music-mix.ew.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played keyboards for [[The Pleased]].

== Personal life ==
Newsom's family includes her brother Pete, a fellow musician, and sister Emily, who inspired her song &quot;Emily&quot; (and contributed backing vocals). She is the second cousin, twice removed, of [[Lieutenant Governor of California|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Gavin Newsom]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfbg.com/38/09/art_music_pleased.html |title=San Francisco Bay Guardian article, 2003 |publisher=Sfbg.com |date=2003-11-26 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has dated [[Noah Georgeson]], [[Bill Callahan (musician)|Bill Callahan]] and is dating [[Andy Samberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article7032768.ece |title=The Times article, 2010|publisher=timesonline.co.uk |date=2010-02-20 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
