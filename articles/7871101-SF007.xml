'''HFSLIP''' was an [[open source]] [[Hotfix]] and [[Service Pack]] [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstreaming]] utility designed to update [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP|XP]], and [[Windows Server 2003|Server 2003]] installation sources.  HFSLIP could be considered a command line interface version of other GUI software like [[nLite]]. Its open source code and flexible options presented a more robust solution to the user.  In addition to hotfixes and service packs, HFSLIP could slipstream other Microsoft updates such as [[Internet Explorer]], [[DirectX]] 9.0c, [[Windows Media Player]], and Windows Media Codecs.  It could also integrate third-party [[device driver]] updates, including [[DriverPacks]].

HFSLIP slipstreamed the binaries (individual files) of most service packs and individual hotfixes directly.  This means that original files were replaced with the newer versions in the updates from the Microsoft Download Center.  For hotfixes that were non-standard or required a special installation procedure, HFSLIP integrated these instead, placing them as they were in the SVCPACK folder, to be installed automatically near the end of Windows setup.

As of May 2010, HFSLIP is no longer being developed, and the main website was taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/144223-sorta-like-bootleg-tape-trading/ |title=Sorta like bootleg tape trading.. |publisher=Microsoft Forum Network |date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
