'''Route 1A''' is a south&amp;ndash;north [[state highway]] in [[Massachusetts]]. It is an alternate route to [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. 1]] with three signed sections and two unsigned sections where the highway is concurrent with its parent. Due to the reconfiguration of tunnel interchanges brought on by the completion of the [[Big Dig (Boston, Massachusetts)|Big Dig]], Route 1A is discontinuous in the downtown [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/mgis/eotroads.htm Executive Office of Transportation - Office of Transportation Planning Roads - June 2008] The older tunnels to and from East Boston have interchanges with I-93 and surface roads north of the point at which unsigned Route 1A &quot;exits&quot; Route 1 in downtown Boston. Unsigned Route 1A along the [[Central Artery|Fitzgerald Expressway]] does not directly connect to those tunnels; a direct connection requires using I-90 and the newer [[Ted Williams Tunnel]], which is not concurrent with Route 1A at any point.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Route description==
===Attleboro===
A short segment of Route 1A, {{convert|1.8|mi|km}} in length, in [[Attleboro, Massachusetts|Attleboro]] runs from [[U.S. Route 1A]] at the [[Rhode Island]] border through a junction with [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]], before heading north and merging with Route 1.  The entire length of this segment is known as Newport Avenue.

===North Attleborough to Dedham===
This segment of Route 1A extends roughly north from [[North Attleboro, Massachusetts|North Attleborough]] to [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], passing through the towns of [[Plainville, Massachusetts|Plainville]], [[Wrentham, Massachusetts|Wrentham]], [[Norfolk, Massachusetts|Norfolk]], [[Walpole, Massachusetts|Walpole]], [[Norwood, Massachusetts|Norwood]] and [[Westwood, Massachusetts|Westwood]] on the way.  Prior to its realignment along [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] and [[Interstate 93|I-93]], Route 1 continued north along the Providence Highway towards Boston at the junction of Route 1A and that road.

===Boston to Salisbury===
This segment of Route 1A extends from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] to [[Salisbury, Massachusetts]].

The highway starts from US 1 (which is on the [[Central Artery]] with [[I-93]] and [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]]) at the former [[Government Center, Boston, Massachusetts|Government Center]]/[[Logan Airport]] interchange. It passes through the [[Callahan Tunnel]] (outbound/northbound, no toll) and [[Sumner Tunnel]] (inbound/southbound, toll), becoming the East Boston Expressway past [[Logan Airport]].  The East Boston Expressway was the first freeway built in the city. Immediately beyond [[Logan Airport]], [[Interstate 90]] ends at Route 1A.

The road continues as a [[divided highway]] through [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]].  It is a limited access highway through Revere, passing [[Suffolk Downs]] and the Wonderland Greyhound Park (which is across the street from the outer terminus of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA's]] Blue Line, before running through the isolated Point of Pines neighborhood) and exiting Revere over the General Edwards Bridge into [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]].  For the first mile and a half in Lynn, it is concurrent with the Lynnway, and is a high-traffic retail area. After the Lynnway portion, the route becomes concurrent with [[Massachusetts Route 129|Route 129]] for a mile, before crossing into Swampscott as Paradise Road.  At Vinnin Square, it passes into [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] as Loring Avenue, passing by Salem State University. The route turns left onto Lafayette Street and is concurrent with Route 114. At the intersection with Derby Street, notable for the large fire station, the route turns right. At the next stop sign, the route turns left onto Hawthorne Boulevard passing Salem Common and the Salem Witch Museum before turning left onto Winter Street. At the end of Winter Street, the route turns right onto Bridge Street crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge into [[Beverly, Massachusetts|Beverly]].  It follows two of the main streets of downtown Beverly, before heading north, passing through [[Wenham, Massachusetts|Wenham]] and [[Hamilton, Massachusetts|Hamilton]] (through this section the road is occasionally signed as a US Route) before becoming the main road through the town of [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], crossing the historic Choate Bridge over the Ipswich River.  While in Ipswich, much of the route runs concurrently with [[Massachusetts Route 133|Route 133]] until just over the town line into [[Rowley, Massachusetts|Rowley]].  It passes through the main village of Rowley, as well as the central villages of [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]].  In [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], it merges with [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|Route 1]], signed with its parent highway over the [[Merrimack River]] and into the town center of [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]]. It then heads east from the Salisbury town center before turning north and ending in Salisbury Beach at the [[New Hampshire]] border.  [[New Hampshire Route 1A]] continues north from this point.
