'''The Zeitgeist Movement''' was founded in 2008. The movement advocates the replacement of current civilization with a money-free and cybernated &quot;resource-based economy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; The Zeitgeist Movement and the Venus Project promote replacing human labour with [[automation]], government will be through collective participation of the public, aided by advanced cybernation.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacque Fresco [http://www.thevenusproject.com/technology/construction &quot;Construction&quot;], ''The Venus Project''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeitgeist India [http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.in/FAQ/ FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the movement, there will be no decision-making process regarding greater social issues by human beings, those decisions are arrived at by using the [[scientific method]], based on the carrying capacity of the Earth, rather than using human opinions.&lt;ref&gt;The Zeitgeist Movement [http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=66 FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement of human decision making by [[artificial intelligence]] is termed 'Social Cybernation'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacque Fresco [http://www.thevenusproject.com/technology/city-systems &quot;City Systems&quot;], Cybernetic Government ''The Venus Project''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Private property]] will not be abolished, but it will become obsolete as culture grows, being replaced by &quot;a system of universal access&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Joseph [http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/The%20Zeitgeist%20Movement.pdf &quot;The Zeitgeist Movement Orientation Guide&quot;], page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media Project===
According to a press release circulated to members on May 12, 2010, the Zeitgeist Media Project (ZMP) Beta was released. According to the press release the Media Project is an extension of the Communications Team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zeitgeistmediaproject.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chapters==
The Zeitgeist Movement members are organized into country/regional, state and city &quot;sub&quot;-chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=492&amp;Itemid=1908 The Zeitgeist Movement Polish]&lt;/ref&gt; Each chapter/sub-chapter is hosted and maintained independently on its own domain, or in sub-domains from the Zeitgeist Movement's main   site. The chapters are coordinated by individuals or groups of individuals who are well-versed in the movement's tenets and direction and have chosen to donate their time to help further its current goals. According to the Zeitgeist Movement July 2010 Newsletter, the Zeitgeist Movement has 46 official country chapters and over 200 regional sub-chapters internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/July2010NL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This includes all 50 official U.S. state chapters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/|title=The Zeitgeist Movement Website | publisher=The Zeitgeist Movement | accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio address===
Rotating members of the movement deliver a weekly radio address which is broadcast every Wednesday on [[Blogtalkradio|BlogTalkRadio]]. These broadcasts define the Zeitgeist Movement and discuss the progress of the movement's efforts, hold interviews with various relevant personalities, and provide information for the Zeitgeist Movement's [[The Zeitgeist Movement#Regional and state chapters|chapters]].  
There are two other BlogTalkRadio shows that discuss the Zeitgeist Movement, a resource-based economy and the Venus Project. One is Z Radio, a weekly broadcast co-hosted by Thunder and Franklee, and produced by Shawn Hodgins.

{{cquote|Who can argue with such a movement? What we have never has worked for the benefit of society as a whole. How much longer can we really expect it to last?

On March 17, 2009, Alan Feuer of the ''New York Times'' wrote in an article:&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/nyregion/17zeitgeist.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Alan | last=Feuer | title=They've Seen the Future and Dislike the Present | date=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|&quot;The mission of the movement is the application of the scientific method for social change,â Mr. Joseph announced by way of introduction. The evening, which began at 7 with a two-hour critique of monetary economics, became by midnight a utopian presentation of a money-free and computer-driven vision of the future, a wholesale reimagination of civilization, as if [[Karl Marx]] and [[Carl Sagan]] had hired [[John Lennon]] from his â[[Imagine (song)|Imagine]]â days to do no less than redesign the underlying structures of planetary life.|200px|New York Times|''New York Times''}}

From the same article:
{{cquote|&quot;If this sounds vaguely like a disaster scenario out of ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', Mr. Fresco did not seem worried in the least. Machines are unemotional and unaggressive, unlike human beings, he told the crowd during the question-and-answer phase. âIf you took your laptop and smashed it in front of 50 other laptops, trust me, none of them would care.â}}

Alan of ''The Sovereign Independent'' wrote of the Zeitgeist Movement:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sovereignindependent.com/?p=13193 Peter Joseph, Jacque Fresco and the Zeitgeist Movement: Venus Flytrap or Final Solution?&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|&quot;The idea, though it is not new, (but is packaged in hypnotising emotional [[propaganda]] movies) sounds lovely. Lets give up our power to machines. In one generation we lose every skill we ever had at managing the earth, growing food, existing as a family unit, forget how to exercise, work at anything and become so dependant on the system that should an error occur the engineers become the new elite, the rulers of the [[technocratic]] [[communist]] sci-fi [[dystopia]].&quot;|200px|The Sovereign Independent|''The Sovereign Independent''}}
