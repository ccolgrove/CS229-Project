==Writing and recording==
''War Is the Answer'' was announced as Five Finger Death Punch's second studio album in May 2009. The album was produced by Kevin Churko, who had previously produced [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s ''[[Black Rain (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Black Rain]]'', and mixed by [[Randy Staub]], who has previously worked with [[Metallica]] and [[Stone Sour]].&lt;ref name=&quot;blab may22&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=120574|title=Five Finger Death Punch Guitarist Discusses Upcoming Album|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarist Zoltan Bathory commented on the style of the album, stating &quot;we've continued the journey we started on the first album, so there's a healthy balance of melody and aggression, and as always we concentrated on writing strong metal songs in the traditional sense.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blab may22&quot;/&gt;

Bathory explained to ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' about the album title, &quot;It's a phrase we've had up our sleeves for some time, and I've been talking about it a lot in interviews. In fact, somebody just asked me: 'If war is the answer, then what is the question?', and I guess the answer to that is &quot;the meaning of life!&quot; Because life IS war. Basically, you're fighting against one thing or another right from the start â you're fighting for survival with pretty much everything against you, you're fighting for social or political positions&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16964|title=War Is The Answer Songfacts|work=Songfacts|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Although ''War Is the Answer'' was originally announced to be released on June 8, 2009, it was pushed back to October 6, 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;blab july10&quot;/&gt; then pulled forward to September 22, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=124436|title=Five Finger Death Punch Guitarist Interviewed On Australia's 'The Racket'; Audio Available|work=Blabbermouth.net|publisher=Roadrunner Records|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, they announced the first leg of their Shock and Raw Tour, which will promote the new album. The second leg was announced on August 17, 2009.

The two bonus tracks, &quot;[[Succubus (song)|Succubus]]&quot; and &quot;Undone&quot; were originally cut from their first album ''The Way of the Fist''. A demo version of &quot;Succubus&quot; was leaked onto the Internet under the title &quot;Hate Me&quot;. The band decided to re-record both songs and include them as bonus tracks on ''War Is the Answer''.
