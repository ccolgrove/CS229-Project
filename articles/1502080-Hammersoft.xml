[[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] '''Sir James Fownes Somerville''' [[Order of the Bath|GCB]], [[Order of the British Empire|GBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (17 July 1882 &amp;ndash; 19 March 1949) was one of the most famous British [[Admiral]]s of [[World War II]].

==Early career==
The son of Arthur Fownes Somerville (1850â1942, who appears to have spent some time farming sheep in [[New Zealand]]), James Fownes Somerville was born in [[Weybridge]], [[Surrey]]. He joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[cadet]] on 15 January 1897, and achieved the rank of [[lieutenant]] on 15 March 1904. Somerville became the Navy's leading radio specialist and served at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] during [[World War I]], where he earned the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his efforts.

Somerville stayed in the service after the war, and on 31 December 1921 was promoted to [[Captain (naval)|captain]] and commanded [[HMS Benbow (1913)|HMS ''Benbow'']]. Somerville served as Director of the [[Admiralty]]'s Signal Department from 1925 to 1927.&lt;ref name=lh&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/SOMERVILLE3.shtml Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to be Flag Captain to Vice Admiral [[John Kelly (Royal Navy officer)|John Kelly]] in 1927 and served as a Naval Instructor at the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] from 1929 to 1931.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; He was made commanding officer of [[HMS Norfolk (78)|HMS ''Norfolk'']] in 1931.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; Promoted to [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]] in 1932, he became Commander of the Royal Navy Barracks at [[Portsmouth]].&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; Promoted to [[rear admiral]] on 12 October 1933 he became Director of Personal Services at the [[Admiralty]] in 1934.&lt;ref name=lh/&gt;

Somerville commanded the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] destroyer flotillas from 1936 to 1938,&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; and during the [[Spanish Civil War]] helped protect [[Majorca]] from the Republicans. In 1938 and 1939 he served as [[East Indies Station|Commander-in-Chief, East Indies]]&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; before being forced to retire in 1939 for medical reasons (it was thought, incorrectly, that he had [[tuberculosis]]).

==European operations, 1939-1942==
He was recalled to duty on special service to the [[Admiralty]] later in 1939 with the start of World War II,&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; and for the next year performed important work on naval [[radar]] development. In May, 1940, Somerville served under Admiral [[Bertram Ramsay]], helping organize the [[Operation Dynamo|evacuation of Dunkirk]].

His next major assignment was as naval commander, on [[HMS Hood (51)|HMS ''Hood'']], of the newly formed [[Force H]] based in [[Gibraltar]].&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; After Marshal [[Philippe PÃ©tain]] of France signed an armistice with [[Germany]] on 22 June 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] gave Somerville the task of neutralizing the main element of the French fleet, at [[Mers-el-KÃ©bir]] in [[North Africa]], attacking and destroying it if all other options failed. Churchill wrote to him:

: ''You are charged with one of the most disagreeable tasks that a British Admiral has ever been faced with, but we have complete confidence in you and rely on you to carry it out relentlessly.''

Although privately he felt that his orders to attack if all other avenues failed were a mistake, Somerville executed his orders, and eventually on 3 July [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|attacked the French fleet]] as they rode at anchor.  Somerville's forces inflicted severe damage on their erstwhile allies, most notably sinking the battleship [[French battleship Bretagne|''Bretagne'']] with heavy loss of life. Several other major French ships were damaged during the bombardment. The operation was judged a success, although he admitted privately to his wife that he had not been quite as aggressive in the destruction as he could have been.

At the head of Force H, on 9 February 1941 Somerville organized a bombardment raid on [[Genoa]], and also played an important role in the pursuit and sinking of the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']] on 26 May 1941. He was also involved in the protection of a number of important [[convoy]]s to [[Malta]] and [[Egypt]]. He received a [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] in 1941 for his successes with Force H.

==Indian Ocean, 1942-1944==
Somerville became [[Eastern Fleet|Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet]] in March 1942, replacing Admiral Sir [[Geoffrey Layton]].&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; The Eastern Fleet had been established at [[Trincomalee]], [[Ceylon]] (Sri Lanka), after the surrender of [[Singapore]], but Somerville was unhappy with the base's security and he ordered the construction of an alternative forward base at [[Addu Atoll]] in the [[Maldives]]. The Japanese advance through [[Burma]] and their capture of the [[Andaman Islands]] enforced the move of the bulk of the Eastern Fleet to Addu Atoll and to [[Kilindini]] in [[East Africa]].

Admiral [[Chuichi Nagumo]]'s powerful [[Indian Ocean Raid]] in April demonstrated the wisdom of Somerville's move from Trincomalee. After the sinking of an aircraft carrier and two cruisers, he attempted to intercept the Japanese fleet, but failed. Had he been successful, it is probable that his two remaining carriers would have been overwhelmed.

In 1944, with reinforcements, he was able to go on the offensive in a series of aggressive air strikes in the Japanese-occupied [[Dutch East Indies]], enabling naval air crews to gain expertise that they would later need in the Pacific.

==Later career==
Somerville was replaced as commander of the Eastern Fleet by Admiral [[Bruce Fraser]] in August 1944. Two months later he was placed in charge of the British Admiralty Delegation in [[Washington D.C.]], from 1944 to December, 1945,&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; where he managed - to the surprise of almost everyone â to get on very well with the notoriously abrasive and anti-British Admiral [[Ernest King]], the [[United States]]' [[Chief of Naval Operations]].

He was promoted to [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] on 8 May 1945,&lt;ref name=lh/&gt; and retired from the service following the war. He was made [[Lord Lieutenant of Somerset]] in August 1946, and lived in the family seat of [[Dinder House]], Somerset, where he died on 19 March 1949.
