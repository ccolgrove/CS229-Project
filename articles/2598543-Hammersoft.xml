&quot;'''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World'''&quot; is a song by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] from his 1995 album ''[[The Gold Experience]]'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/Artist-Formerly-Known-As-Prince-The-Most-Beautiful-Girl-In-The-World/master/113841&lt;/ref&gt; It was his first release since changing his stage name to an unpronounceable symbol. With the consent of Prince's usual record distributor [[Warner Bros. Records]], &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot; was released by [[NPG Records]] and [[Edel Music]] and independently distributed by [[Bellmark Records]], as a one-off single. The single was released in February 1994, and was shortly followed by an [[Extended play|EP]] of [[remix]]es titled ''[[The Beautiful Experience]]''. The version that was released on ''The Gold Experience'' is a different mix of the song.

==Development==
The original track is a slow-grooving [[ballad]] that serenades a beautiful woman, and was likely directed toward his soon to be fiancÃ© [[Mayte Garcia]], whom he later married on Valentine's Day, 1996. It is also claimed that Prince was inspired by actress [[Vanessa Marcil]].  The song was played during the [[Miss America]] pageant in 1994, but not in full.  It was widely advertised in news and trade magazines that a new song from Prince would be premiered on the pageant.  The ads had Prince sitting in a chair with a hat pulled down over his face, and Mayte standing next to his chair. The song was later released on February 24, 1994.  It again later appeared on ''[[The Gold Experience]]''.  The version on ''The Gold Experience'' is replayed.  The drums are more crisp in the mix and there are slight instrumental changes.  There are also added sound effects and instrumental breaks in the second version.  The bridge is slightly more robust as well.  The song is still based in light [[guitar]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s and live [[drum]]s.  Although most of the song is sung in falsetto with Prince reaching some extremely high notes, the bridge has him using his regular voice as well as a lower baritone range in parts. 

The song was a worldwide hit and established Prince's ability to succeed commercially under his new name, peaking at #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. It became his first (and to date, only) UK #1 single under any name as a performer. He did have two other UK #1s as a songwriter: the 1984 hit single &quot;[[I Feel for You]]&quot; by [[Chaka Khan]] and [[SinÃ©ad O'Connor]]'s 1990 cover of &quot;[[Nothing Compares 2 U]]&quot;. It was also his first (and to date, only) #1 song in the [[Netherlands]].

==Mayte version==
Prince's then-wife, Mayte, later recorded her own version called &quot;The Most Beautiful Boy in the World&quot;. The song appears on her album ''[[Child of the Sun (album)|Child of the Sun]]''. The B-side was a Spanish version of the song, &quot;I Quieres Ser El Mas Bello De Este Mundo?&quot;. It was the same instrumental track with extra reverb, and her vocals, with a few slight ad-lib changes. It was released on [[Paisley Park Records]] on June 7, 1995, Prince's birthday.  

== Cover versions ==
*In 2003, pianist [[Alex Bugnon]] covered the song on his album ''Southern Living''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narada.com/images/AlbumPage/SouthernLiving/southernliving_page.htm|title=Southern Living|work=[[Narada Productions|Narada.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/14442-southern-living-alex-bugnon|title=Southern Living Alex Bugnon|work=[[JazzTimes|JazzTimes.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
