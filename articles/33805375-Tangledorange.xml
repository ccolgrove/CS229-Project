'''Occupy UC Davis''' is an ongoing series of [[Occupy Movement]] demonstrations at the [[University of California, Davis]]. It is distinguished from the off-campus but allied [[Occupy Davis]].  Occupy UC Davis gained international attention on November 18, 2011 after a video on YouTube went viral of University police [[pepper-spray]]ing a group of peaceful demonstrators as they were seated on a sidewalk.&lt;ref&gt;CS Monitor [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/1119/UC-Davis-pepper-spray-smear-tactics-Occupy-protests-face-rougher-response UC Davis Pepper-Sprays Protestors]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Police officers claimed that demonstrators had surrounded them and that they used the pepper-spray in self-defense.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  However, videos of the event did not support the claim that the non-violent protestors posed any threat to the officers.  Consequently, two UC Davis police officers and UC Davis Police Chief Annette Spicuzza were placed on administrative leave while UC Davis student and faculty organizations are calling for the resignation of UC Davis Chancellor [[Linda P.B. Katehi]].  [[Mark Yudof]], president of the [[University of California]] system, has called for a review of all UC protocols for dealing with non-violent protestors.

The image of John Pike using pepper spray on the students become an internet meme, with the image appearing on many historically significant works of art, including Trumbull's Declaration of Independence and the cover of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

==Background==
Occupy UC Davis draws upon [[nonviolence|non-violent]] [[civil disobedience]] of the kind used in the [[American Civil Rights Movement]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  [[Occupy Wall Street]] ('''OWS''') began on September 17, 2011, in New York City's [[Zuccotti Park]] in the [[Wall Street]] financial district with protests focused on social and [[economic inequality]], high unemployment, greed, as well as corruption, and the undue influence of corporationsâparticularly that of the [[financial services]] sectorâon government. The protesters' slogan ''[[We are the 99%]]'' refers to the growing [[income inequality in the United States|difference in wealth]] in the U.S. between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population. The protest since grew into a world-wide movement known as the [[Occupy Movement]].  

[[Occupy Cal]] is an on-going series of protests at [[UC Berkeley]].  A major theme of the Occupy demonstrations at California public universities is the role of [[education]] in creating [[jobs]] and improving the quality of life of society as a whole, and the contrasting failure of the [[UC Regents]] and the [[California|State of California]] to honor commitments made in the California Master Plan for Higher Education. Recent 81% tuition increases for students, mandatory furloughs (including for professors), firings of lower-ranking workers (especially those working directly with students), and well-publicized raises for the highest paid administrators have further fueled discontent both within the [[University of California]] system (of which UC Davis is a part) and within the [[California State University]] system, which has also seen large tuition raises and consequent protests.

[[Occupy Davis]] (as opposed to Occupy UC Davis) was formed in response to police violence at Occupy Cal and other protests.  Occupy Davis protestors occupied the city's Central Park in mid-October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sakash|first=Tom|title=Occupy Davis chooses Central Park as its focus|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/occupy-davis-chooses-central-park-as-its-focus/|accessdate=November 22, 2011|newspaper=Davis Enterprise|date=October 13, 2011|page=A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}On November 9, students and professors at UC Berkeley began with a series of &quot;teach-ins&quot; around campus, a noon rally and march.  Approximately 1,500 demonstrators attended the days' events. &lt;ref name=10KGO&gt;{{cite news|last=Hollyfield|first=Amy|title=Occupy Cal calm, but ready for showdown|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&amp;id=8426365|accessdate=November 13, 2011|newspaper=KGO-TV|date=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midday, protestors set up seven tents to symbolize their support for [[Occupy Movement]].  In response, law enforcement officials from UC Berkeley Police, the [[Alameda County Sheriff's Office]] and other UC Police officers in [[riot gear]] arrived to remove the seven tents from the protest site. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Asimov|first=Nanette|title=Occupy Cal protesters vote to strike on Tuesday|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/10/MNH21LT6ND.DTL|accessdate=November 13, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=SF2&gt;{{cite news|last=Asimov|first=Nanette|title=UC campus police move in on student protesters|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/11/10/BA861LSR8G.DTL|accessdate=November 13, 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2011, Chancellor Katehi ordered [[Occupy movement]] protesters on the UC Davis campus to remove their tents from the quad. The reason for this was based on University event policies that stated unless a permit was reserved, the use of tents was unlawful and could potentially create hazards for students over the weekend, when resources were limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cevs.ucdavis.edu/Public/]&lt;/ref&gt; When a group of protestors engaged in [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[civil disobedience]] refused to remove their tents and staged a sit-in, campus police officers [[pepper spray]]ed them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/20/us/california-occupy-pepperspray/index.html|title=California university launches inquiry into pepper spray of protesters|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 20, 2011|date=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven protesters received medical treatment; two were hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/crime-fire-courts/protests-again-gathering-steam-on-campus/|title=UCD to review pepper-spraying, clearing of protesters|publisher=Davis Enterprise|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[The Cleveland Leader]] | title=UC Davis Police Brutally Pepper Spray OWS Protesters Sitting Peacefully  on Campus | url=http://www.clevelandleader.com/node/17846 | first=Julie | last= Kent | date= November 19, 2011 | accessdate =November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Brown, assistant professor at UC Davis, said, &quot;One of them, forty-five minutes after being pepper-sprayed down his throat, was still coughing up blood.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;independent_adams&quot;&gt;Guy Adams, [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/outcry-over-chilling-campus-pepper-spray-use-6265203.html Outcry over 'chilling' campus pepper spray use], [[The Independent]], November 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The police have not responded to these claims.

According to police and university officials, the 35 or so officers present felt surrounded. One of the officers who used pepper spray was identified as Lieutenant John Pike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huliq.com/10178/video-pepper-spray-aftermath-uc-davis-professor-demands-chancellors-resignation &quot;Video In pepper spray aftermath&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Ten arrests were made.&lt;ref name = âCSMâ&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/1120/UC-Davis-pepper-spray-incident-goes-viral/%28page%29/2 Brad Knickerbocker, âUC Davis pepper spray incident goes viralâ, The Christian Science Monitor, November 20, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;. A demonstrator said that the police were encircled by the demonstrators. &quot;A collective decision was made on the fly to just sit in a circle arms linked legs crossed, with police officers and &quot;prisoners&quot; in the middle because we didn't want them arresting only 3 of us. It wasn't fair that 50 of us were there, and only a few arrested who hadn't volunteered to be arrested. There was still one walkway open that the police were going to use to walk the arrestees out. I saw some friends of mine sit down there, and they were my friends, so I joined them. We linked arms, legs crossed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2011/11/20/ucdeyetwitness.html Xeni Jardin, &quot;Interview with a pepper-sprayed UC Davis student&quot;], BoingBoing.net, Nov 20.

The meme has relevance in public and political discourse surrounding the Occupy protests in North America.  As of November 21, the meme was mentioned in more than 40,000 page references in [[Google]] search queries, and in online articles from the [[Huffington Post]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', and ''[[The Washington Post]]''. As of November 29, the website [http://KnowYourMeme.com KnowYourMeme.com], which collects and records memes and their metrics, had collected [http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepper-spray-cop-casually-pepper-spray-everything-cop/photos over 1,600 variations] and the number was still growing.

An article in ''The Washington Post'' dated November 21, 2011 identified the officer depicted in the images as Lt. John Pike of the UC Davis campus police. The Huffington Post quoted UC Davis chancellor, [[Linda P.B. Katehi]], as saying the officer had been placed on leave pending an investigation, though she did not mention the officer's name directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jason | last = Dearen | title = UC Davis Pepper Spray Incident Prompts Suspension Of Officers | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/20/uc-davis-pepper-spray-inc_n_1104104.html | publisher = ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' | date = November 20, 2011 | accessdate = November 21, 2011 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The meme has sparked a public debate regarding the appropriate use of pepper spray. On Monday, November 21, 2011, [[Fox News]] commentator [[Megyn Kelly]] appeared on political talk show [[The O'Reilly Factor]] saying of pepper spray &quot;itâs like a derivative of real pepper. Itâs a food product essentially.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Justin | last = Bank | title = Megyn Kelly minimizes pepper spray; Should she test it out? | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/megyn-kellys-minimizes-pepper-spray-should-she-test-it-out/2011/11/22/gIQAXQyEoN_blog.html | publisher = ''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date = November 23, 2011 | accessdate = November 24, 2011
