The '''Hundred Days War''' ([[Arabic]]: Ø­Ø±Ø¨ Ø§ÙÙØ¦Ø© ÙÙÙ | ''Harb Al-Miaâat Yaoum''), also known as ''''La Guerre des Cent Jours'''' in [[French language|French]] was a subconflict within the [[Lebanese_Civil_War#Second_phase_of_the_war.2C_1977-1982|1977â82 phase of the Lebanese Civil War]] which occurred at the Lebanese Capital [[Beirut]]. It was fought between the Christian [[Lebanese Forces]] (LF) militia, under the command of the [[Kataeb Party]]'s President [[Bashir Gemayel]], and the Syrian troops of the [[Arab Deterrent Force]] (ADF).

==Background==
{{Campaignbox Lebanese Civil War}}

===February 1978===
After a series of bomb attacks that rocked Beirut on early [[February 1978]], the ADF stepped up its security measures by increasing the number of patrols and checkpoints in the streets.  On the 7th, Lebanese soldiers belonging to the [[Army of Free Lebanon]] (AFL) â a splinter faction of the official [[Lebanese Army]] led by the rightist dissident [[Colonel]] [[Antoine Barakat]] â objected to the ADF establishing a checkpoint near their HQ at the main [[Fayadieh]] barracks, a forteress-like military facility located in the namesake Christian district.
The ADF detachment, which comprised twenty Syrian regular soldiers, refused to move out, causing an argument which ended with a shootout on which 19 people lost their lives.  The Syrian soldiers were taken prisoner by the AFL regulars and held hostage at Fayadieh barracks, and the situation grew tenser that dawn when the bodies of two slain Christians were found nearby.

The next day, Syrian ADF infantry units backed by artillery surrounded and bombarded the AFL fortified barracks, setting part of the complex on fire.

Lebanese Forces âCommandoâ troops under the command of [[Bashir Gemayel]] and the [[Tigers Militia (Lebanon)|Tigers Militia]] led by [[Dany Chamoun]] were drawn into the action against the Syrians. That afternoon Syria shelled Achrafieh and attacked the Tigers' HQ. The fighting soon spread to east of [[Beirut]] and [[Mount Lebanon]]. Syrians took high buildings such as Burj Rizk Achrafieh and Burj El Murr using snipers and heavy weapons against civilians. The soldiers stayed for 90 days.

Another major clash took place near the Sodeco area in Achrafieh where the Lebanese Forces fought ferociously and led the Syrian army out of the Rizk Building.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t28UYcXZRCs&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Israel was the primary backer of the Lebanese Frontâs militia.

===March 1978===

===April 1978===
In April, rightist leaders accused the ADF of bias when it intervened to contain the clashes across the [[Green Line (Lebanon)|Green Line]] between the Christian-held [[Ain al-Rammaneh]] and Muslim-held [[Shiyah]] districts of Beirut.

==Consequences==
However, the LF attack on the pro-Syrian [[Marada Brigade]] militia of the [[Frangieh]] Clan that summer, which culminated in the infamous [[Ehden massacre]], provoked another round of fighting in JuneâJuly.  President Sarkis threatened to resign in protest over the Syrian bombardment of East Beirut, but later withdrew his resignation when the shelling stopped.
More fighting erupted in the fall, again followed by a ceasefire. In [[October 1978]], the [[Foreign Minister]]s of [[Lebanon]] and those [[Arab League]] states contributing to the ADF â [[Syria]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Sudan]], [[Qatar]], and the [[UAE]]) â met at the town of [[Beiteddine|Beit ed-Dine]], in the [[Chouf District]] south-east of Beirut. The outcome of the meeting was essentially a reaffirmation of the role of the ADF and a strong condemnation of those dealing with [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Text of the Beit ed-Dine declaration in ''Middle East Report (MER)'', October 21, 1978, pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
