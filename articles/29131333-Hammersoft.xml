'''''Snyder v. Phelps''''' was a case heard by [[Supreme Court of the United States]] on whether the First Amendment protected protests of public protestors at a funeral against tort liability. It involved a claim of [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] made by Albert Snyder, the father of Matthew Snyder, a Marine who died in the [[Iraq War]]. The claim was made against the Phelps family, including [[Fred Phelps]], and against Phelps' [[Westboro Baptist Church]] (WBC). The Court ruled in favor of Phelps in an 8-1 decision, holding that their speech related to a public issue, and was disseminated on a public sidewalk.

== Background ==
[[File:Fred Phelps on his pulpit.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Pastor [[Fred Phelps]]]]
On March 10, 2006, Westboro Baptist Church picketed the funeral of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Lance Corporal]] Matthew A. Snyder, who was killed in a non-combat-related vehicle accident in [[Iraq]] on March 3, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = DoD Identifies Marine Casualty   | publisher =   U.S. Dept. of Defense | date = 2006-03-06   | url = http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=9356 | accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Canty | first = Michele | title = Military Report Details Crash | newspaper = York Daily Record | location = York, Pennsylvania | date = 2007-11-25 | url = http://www.ydr.com/vets/ci_7555437 | accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8, WBC announced its intention of picketing the funeral in [[Westminister, Maryland]], as it had done at thousands of other funerals throughout the country in protest of what they considered America's increasing tolerance of [[homosexuality]].  Picketers displayed placards such as &quot;America is doomed&quot;, &quot;You're going to hell&quot;, &quot;God hates you&quot;, &quot;Fag troops&quot;, &quot;Semper fi fags&quot; and &quot;Thank God for dead soldiers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Snyder v.

Fred W. Phelps Sr, John Does, Jane Does, and Westboro Baptist Church, Inc.] United States District Court District of Maryland, retrieved 2011-05-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Snyder, Matthew Snyder's father, sued Fred Phelps, Westboro Baptist Church and two of Phelps's daughters, Rebekah Phelps-Davis and [[Shirley Phelps-Roper]], for [[defamation]], [[Privacy laws of the United States#Intrusion of solitude and seclusion|intrusion upon seclusion]], [[Privacy laws of the United States#Public disclosure|publicity given to private life]], [[intentional infliction of emotional distress]] and [[Conspiracy (civil)|civil conspiracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;complaint&quot;/&gt;  The claim of defamation arising from comments posted about Snyder on the WBC website was dismissed, on the grounds that the contents were &quot;essentially Phelps-Roper's religious opinion and would not realistically tend to expose the Plaintiff to public hatred or scorn&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;posttrial&quot;&gt;{{Cite court | litigants = Snyder v.

The case proceeded to trial on the remaining three counts.&lt;ref name=&quot;posttrial&quot;/&gt;

The facts of the case were essentially undisputed at trial. Albert Snyder testified:
{{cquote|They turned this funeral into a [[media circus]] and they wanted to hurt my family. They wanted their message heard and they didn't care who they stepped over. My son should have been buried with dignity, not with a bunch of clowns outside&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;simmons&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last =   Simmons | first = Melody | title = Marineâs Father Sues Church for Cheering Sonâs Death | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 2007-10-27 | url = http://www.eveningsun.com/ci_7277523 | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Snyder described his emotional injuries, including that he became tearful and angry and physically nauseated to the point that he would vomit. He stated that the Defendants had placed a &quot;bug&quot; in his head, so that he was unable to think of his son without thinking of their actions, adding, &quot;I want so badly to remember all the good stuff and so far, I remember the good stuff, but it always turns into the bad&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;4thcircuit&quot;&gt;{{Cite court |litigants = Snyder v. Phelps | vol = 580 F.3d 206 | reporter = 4th Cir. | date = 2009 | url= http://www.wneclaw.com/firstamendment/snydervphelps4thcir.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snyder called several expert witnesses who testified that worsening of his [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] and severe [[depression (mood)|depression]] had resulted from the Defendants' activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;simmons&quot;/&gt;

In their defense, WBC established that they had complied with all local ordinances and had obeyed police instructions. The picket was held in a location cordoned off by the police, approximately 1000 feet from the church, from which it could be neither seen nor heard. Mr. Snyder testified that, although he glimpsed the tops of the signs from the funeral procession, he did not see their content until he watched a news program on television later that day. He also indicated that he had found the WBC's statements about his son on their webpage from a [[Google]] search.&lt;ref name=&quot;4thcircuit&quot;/&gt;

In his instructions to the jury, Judge [[Richard D. Bennett]] for the [[United States District Court for the District of Maryland|District Court of Maryland]] stated that the First Amendment protection of free speech has limits, including [[Vulgarity|vulgar]], [[Obscenity|offensive and shocking statements]], and that the jury must decide &quot;whether the defendant's actions would be highly offensive to a [[reasonable person]], whether they were extreme and outrageous and whether these actions were so offensive and shocking as to not be entitled to First Amendment protection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See also ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'', a case where certain personal slurs and obscene utterances by an individual were found unworthy of First Amendment protection, due to the potential for violence resulting from their utterance.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;4thcircuit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =  Donaldson-Evans | first = Catherine | title = Father of Marine Killed in Iraq Sues Church for Cheering Death, Appeals to Public Online for Help | newspaper = Fox News | date = 2007-10-26 | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,305279,00.html | accessdate = 2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; WBC unsuccessfully sought a [[Trial#Mistrials|mistrial]] based on alleged prejudicial statements made by the judge and violations of the [[gag order]] by the plaintiff's attorney.  An [[appeal]] was also sought by the WBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = $11M Damage Award for Picketing Funeral | newspaper = The Seattle Times | date = 2007-11-01 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003986773_funeral01.html | accessdate = 2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2007, the jury found for the Plaintiff and awarded Snyder's father {{USD|2.9 million}} in compensatory damages, later adding a decision to award $6 million in [[punitive damages]] for invasion of privacy and an additional $2 million for causing emotional distress (a total of $10.9 million).  The Phelps said the church would not change its message because of the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Dominguez | first = Alex | title = Jury Awards Father $11M in Funeral Case | newspaper = North County Times | date = 2007-10-31 | url = http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2007/11/02/military/6_23_2911_1_07.txt | accessdate = 2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On February 4, 2008, Bennett upheld the verdict but reduced the punitive damages from $8 million to $2.1 million, to take into consideration the resources of WBC. The total judgment then stood at $5 million.  Court [[lien|liens]] were ordered on church buildings and Phelps's law office in an attempt to ensure that the damages were paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Hall | first = Mike | title = Walls Close in on Phelpses | newspaper = The Topeka Capital-Journal | date = 2008-04-04 | url = http://cjonline.com/stories/040408/loc_264906171.shtml | accessdate = 2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An appeal by WBC was heard on September 24, 2009. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the jury verdict and set aside the lower court's $5 million judgment. The Fourth Circuit ruled that the lower court had erred by instructing the jury to decide a question of law rather than fact (specifically, whether or not the speech in question was protected by the First Amendment). It also ruled that the protest signs and language on WBC's website were rhetorical hyperbole and figurative expression, rather than assertions of actual fact, and so were a form of protected speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;4thcircuit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Issues==
The questions presented are as follows:&lt;ref name=&quot;09-751&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = 09-751 Snyder V. Phelps | publisher = Supreme Court | date = 2010-03-08 | url = http://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/09-00751qp.pdf | accessdate = 2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Whether the prohibition of awarding damages to public figures to compensate for the intentional infliction of emotional distress, under the Supreme Courtâs First Amendment precedents, applies to a case involving two private persons regarding a private matter;
#Whether the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment trumps its freedom of religion and peaceful assembly; and 
#Whether an individual attending a family memberâs funeral constitutes a &quot;[[Rowan v. U.S. Post Office Dept.|captive audience]]&quot; who is entitled to state protection from unwanted communication.

Law professor Deana Pollard Sacks, who presented a historical analysis of cases and issues significant to this case that was published by the [[Yale Law Journal]], concluded:

{{quote|Established speech-tort precedent holds that the greatest speech protection is imposed where the plaintiff is a public figure, the speech is of public concern, and the injury is purely emotional or dignitary in nature. To the contrary, where the plaintiff is a private individual, the speech is private in nature, or the injury involves more than mere âfeelings or reputation,â the First Amendment presents less of an obstacle to tort liability.&lt;ref name=&quot;yale&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sacks  | first = Deana Pollard  | title = Snyder v.

==Briefs==
Several news and civil rights organizations filed [[Amicus curiae|amicus briefs]] in support of Phelps, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Shapiro | first = Steven R. | coauthors = Deborah A.

==Supreme Court decision==
[[File:Official roberts CJ.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Chief Justice]] [[John Roberts]] wrote the majority opinion.]]
In an 8-1 decision (with the judges ruling the same way as they did in ''[[United States v. Stevens]]'' in 2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Singer | first = Sam | title = Previewing Phelps v. Snyder | newspaper = The Daily Caller | date = 2010-10-05 | url = http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/05/previewing-phelps-v-snyder/ | accessdate = 2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Phelps, upholding the Fourth Circuit's decision. Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] (as in the ''Stevens'' case) wrote the majority opinion stating &quot;What Westboro said, in the whole context of how and where it chose to say it, is entitled to 'special protection' under the First Amendment and that protection cannot be overcome by a jury finding that the picketing was outrageous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;geidner&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Geidner | first = Chris | title = Supreme Court Upholds Westboro Baptist Church Members' Right to Picket Funerals | newspaper = Metro Weekly | date = 2011-03-02 | url = http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2011/03/supreme-court-upholds-westboro.html | accessdate = 2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court's opinion also stated that the memorial service was not disturbed, saying, &quot;Westboro stayed well away from the memorial service, Snyder could see no more than the tops of the picketers' signs, and there is no indication that the picketing interfered with the funeral service itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Mears | first = Bill | title = Anti-gay church's right to protest at military funerals is upheld | newspaper = CNN.com | date = 2011-03-02 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/03/02/scotus.westboro.church/index.html?iref=allsearch | accessdate = 2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision also declined to expand the &quot;captive audience doctrine&quot;, saying that Snyder was not in a state where he was coerced to hear the negative speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;gregory&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Gregory | first = Sean | title = Why the Supreme Court Ruled for Westboro | newspaper = Time Magazine | date = 2011-03-03 | url = http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2056613,00.html | accessdate = 2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] wrote a concurring opinion, emphasizing his view that the decision related only to picketing, and did not take Westboro Baptist Church's on-line publications that attacked the Snyder family into consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Barnes | first = Robert | title = Supreme Court Rules First Amendment Protects Church's Right to Picket Funerals | newspaper = Washington Post | date = 2011-03-03 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/02/AR2011030202548.html | accessdate = 2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Samuel Alito]], as in the ''Stevens'' case, was the lone dissenting justice in this case, beginning his dissent with, &quot;Our profound national commitment to free and open debate is not a license for the vicious verbal assault that occurred in this case&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;geidner&quot;/&gt;  He concluded, &quot;In order to have a society in which public issues can be openly and vigorously debated, it is not necessary to allow the brutalization of innocent victims like petitioner&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gregory&quot;/&gt;
