'''Video game music''' is any of the musical pieces or [[soundtrack]]s and [[background music]]s found in [[video game]]s.  It can range from a primitive synthesizer tune to an orchestral piece, usually such that the older the game, the simpler the music. In recent times, many games have had complex soundtracks similar to those of movies, and sometimes even interactive soundtracks which change in order to create an appropriate atmosphere, based on what the player does.  It is also much more common for video game soundtracks to be commercially sold or even be performed in concerts that focus on video game music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Distance Worlds--&gt; |url=http://www.ffdistantworlds.com/index.php?option=com_eventlist&amp;view=categoryevents&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=59 |title=Distant World: International Final Fantasy Concert Series |publisher=Ffdistantworlds.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Music can also be an important gameplay element in certain types of video games (like [[rhythm games]]).

== History ==
=== Early video game technology and computer chip music ===
{{listen|filename=Chiptune2.ogg|title=An original synthesized composition imitating early video game music.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

At the time [[video game]]s emerged as a form of entertainment in the 1970s (the [[History of video game consoles (first generation)|first generation]]), [[music]] was stored on physical medium in analog waveforms such as [[compact cassette]]s and [[phonograph record]]s. Such components were expensive and prone to breakage under heavy use making them less than ideal for use in an [[arcade cabinet]], though in rare cases, they were used (''[[Journey (arcade game)|Journey]]''). A more affordable method of having music in a video game was to use digital means, where a specific computer chip would change electrical impulses from computer code into analog sound waves [[on the fly]] for output on a speaker. Sound effects for the games were also generated in this fashion.

While this allowed for inclusion of music in early [[Arcade game|arcade video games]], it was usually monophonic, [[Music loop|looped]] or used sparingly between stages or at the start of a new game, such as the [[Namco]] titles ''[[Pac-Man]]'' (1980) composed by Toshio Kai or ''[[Pole Position]]'' (1982) composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi.&lt;ref name=&quot;vgmdb_namco&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Game Music|url=http://vgmdb.net/album/489|work=VGMdb|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example of video game music was the opening tune in [[Tomohiro Nishikado]]'s ''[[Gun Fight]]'' (1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Ry-qc4yhFC0|Gun Fight}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first game to use a continuous background [[soundtrack]] was [[Tomohiro Nishikado]]'s ''[[Space Invaders]]'', released by [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] in 1978. It had four simple [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] descending [[bass note]]s repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and interacted with the player, increasing pace as the enemies descended on the player.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=From Pac-Man to pop music: interactive audio in games and new media|author=Karen Collins|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]]|year=2008|isbn=0754662004|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?ei=1I-NTZ7JKsq3hQeDpem7Dg|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first video game to feature [[background music]] was ''[[Rally-X]]'', released by [[Namco]] in 1980, featuring a simple tune that repeats continuously during [[gameplay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gradar2&quot;&gt;[http://www.gamesradar.com/f/gamings-most-important-evolutions/a-20101008102331322035/p-2 Gaming's Most Important Evolutions], [[GamesRadar]]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to include any music into a video game meant that at some point it would have to be transcribed into computer code by a programmer, whether or not the programmer had musical experience. Some music was original, some was [[public domain music]] such as folk songs. Sound capabilities were limited; the popular [[Atari 2600]] home system, for example, was capable of generating only two tones, or &quot;notes&quot;, at a time.

As advances were made in silicon technology and costs fell, a definitively new generation of arcade machines and [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|home consoles]] allowed for great changes in accompanying music. In arcades, machines based on the [[Motorola 68000 family|Motorola 68000]] CPU and accompanying various [[Yamaha]] YM [[programmable sound generator]] [[sound chip]]s allowed for several more tones or &quot;channels&quot; of sound, sometimes eight or more. The earliest known example of this was [[Sega]]'s 1980 arcade game ''[[Carnival (arcade game)|Carnival]]'', which used an [[AY-3-8910]] chip to create an electronic rendition of the [[Classical music|classical]] 1889 composition &quot;[[Over The Waves]]&quot; by [[Juventino Rosas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;collins_12&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Karen|title=Game sound: an introduction to the history, theory, and practice of video game music and sound design|year=2008|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=026203378X|page=12|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnw0Zb4St-wC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konami]]'s 1981 arcade game ''[[Frogger]]'' introduced a dynamic approach to video game music, using at least eleven different gameplay songs, in addition to level-starting and [[game over]] themes, which change according to the player's actions. This was further improved upon by [[Namco]]'s 1983 arcade game ''[[Dig Dug]]'', where the music stopped when the player stopped moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Karen|title=Game sound: an introduction to the history, theory, and practice of video game music and sound design|year=2008|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=026203378X|pages=19â20|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnw0Zb4St-wC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dig Dug'' was composed by Yuriko Keino, who also composed the music for other Namco games such as ''[[Xevious]]'' (1982) and ''[[Phozon]]'' (1983).&lt;ref name=&quot;vgmdb_namco&quot;/&gt;

Home console systems also had a comparable upgrade in sound ability beginning with the [[ColecoVision]] in 1982 capable of four channels. However, more notable was the Japanese release of the Famicom in 1983 which was later released in the US as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1985. It was capable of five channels, one being capable of simple [[PCM]] sampled sound. The home computer [[Commodore 64]] released in 1982 was capable of early forms of filtering effects, different types of [[waveform]]s and eventually the ability to play 4-bit samples on a fourth sound channel. Its comparatively low cost made it a popular alternative to other home computers, as well as its ability to use a TV for an affordable display monitor.

Approach to game music development in this time period usually involved using simple tone generation and/or [[frequency modulation synthesis]] to simulate instruments for melodies, and use of a &quot;noise channel&quot; for simulating percussive noises.Some latter games started to use triangle/square tones for bass/snare noises. Usually with the noise. Early use of PCM samples in this era was limited to sound bites(''Monopoly''), or as an alternate for percussion sounds (''[[Super Mario Bros 3]]''). The music on home consoles often had to share the available channels with other sound effects. For example, if a laser beam was fired by a spaceship, and the laser used a 1400&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, then whichever channel was in use by music would stop playing music and start playing the sound effect.

The mid-to-late 1980s software releases for these platforms had music developed by more people with greater musical experience than before. Quality of composition improved noticeably, and evidence of the popularity of music of this time period remains even today. Composers who made a name for themselves with their software include [[Nobuo Uematsu]] (''[[Final Fantasy]]''), [[Koji Kondo]] (''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''), [[Koichi Sugiyama]] (''[[Dragon Quest]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sugimania.com/ |title=Koichi Sugiyama Home Page |publisher=Sugimania.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miki Higashino]] (''[[Gradius]]'', ''[[Yie-Ar Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''), Hiroshi Miyauchi (''[[Space Harrier]]'', ''[[Hang-On]]'', ''[[Out Run]]''), [[Rob Hubbard]] (''[[Monty On the Run]]'', ''[[International Karate]]''), [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] (''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[Kid Icarus]]'', ''[[EarthBound]]''), [[Martin Galway]] (''[[Daley Thompson's Decathlon]]'', ''[[Stryker's Run]]'', ''[[Times of Lore]]''), [[Yuzo Koshiro]] (''[[Dragon Slayer (series)|Dragon Slayer]]'', ''[[Ys (series)|Ys]]'', ''[[Shinobi (series)|Shinobi]]'', ''[[ActRaiser]]'', ''[[Streets of Rage (series)|Streets of Rage]]''), Mieko Ishikawa (''Dragon Slayer'', ''Ys''), and [[Ryu Umemoto]] ([[visual novel]]s, [[shoot 'em up]]s).  By the late 1980s, video game music was being sold as cassette tape soundtracks in Japan, inspiring American companies such as [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra]], [[Cinemaware]] and [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] to give more serious attention to video game music by 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=[[Computer Gaming World]]|year=1988|month=July|issue=49|page=8|title=The Sound of Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the life-cycle of the Famicom, some game producers at their own expense custom manufactured their cartridges with an additional tone generating chip. These chips added to the existing sound chip in the Famicom, but also sported extra features to modulate the additional channels.

=== Early digital synthesis and sampling ===
From around 1980, some arcade games began taking steps toward digitized, or [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]], sounds. [[Namco]]'s 1980 arcade game ''[[Rally-X]]'' was the first known game to use a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC) to produce sampled tones instead of a tone generator.&lt;ref name=&quot;collins_12&quot;/&gt; That same year, the first known video game to feature [[speech synthesis]] was also released: Sunsoft's [[shoot 'em up]] game ''[[Stratovox]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradar2&quot;/&gt; Around the same time,&lt;ref name=&quot;karen_10-1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Karen|title=Game sound: an introduction to the history, theory, and practice of video game music and sound design|year=2008|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=026203378X|pages=10â1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnw0Zb4St-wC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of [[frequency modulation synthesis]] (FM synthesis), first commercially released by [[Yamaha]] for their [[digital synthesizer]]s and FM [[sound chip]]s, allowed the tones to be manipulated to have different sound characteristics, where before the tone generated by the chip was limited to the design of the chip itself. [[Konami]]'s 1983 arcade game ''[[Gyruss]]'' utilized five synthesis sound chips along with a DAC, which were partly used to create an electronic rendition of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s ''[[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565|Toccata and Fugue in D minor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Karen|title=Game sound: an introduction to the history, theory, and practice of video game music and sound design|year=2008|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=026203378X|page=19|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnw0Zb4St-wC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond arcade games, significant improvements to [[personal computer game]] music were made possible with the introduction of [[Digital synthesizer|digital]] FM [[Sound card|synth boards]], which [[Yamaha]] released for Japanese computers such as the [[NEC PC-8801]] and [[NEC PC-9801|PC-9801]] in the early 1980s, and by the mid-1980s, the PC-8801 and [[FM-7]] had built-in FM sound. This allowed computer game music to have greater complexity than the simplistic [[Beep (sound)|beeps]] from internal speakers. These FM synth boards produced a &quot;warm and pleasant sound&quot; that musicians such as [[Yuzo Koshiro]] and [[Takeshi Abo]] utilized to produce music that is still highly regarded within the [[chiptune]] community.&lt;ref name=&quot;hg101_retro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm|title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier Retro Japanese Computers|author=John Szczepaniak|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=2011-03-29}} Reprinted from {{citation|title=[[Retro Gamer]]''|issue=67|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread adoption of FM synthesis by consoles would later be one of the major advances of the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]], by which time 16-bit arcade machines were using multiple FM synthesis chips.&lt;ref name=&quot;karen_10-1&quot;/&gt;

One of the earliest [[home computer]]s to make use of digital signal processing in the form of sampling was the [[Commodore Amiga]] in 1985. The computer's sound chip featured four independent 8-bit [[digital-to-analog converter]]s. Developers could use this platform to take [[Sampling (signal processing)|samples]] of a music performance, sometimes just a single note long, and play it back through the computer's [[sound chip]] from memory. This differed from ''Rally-X'' in that its hardware DAC was used to play back simple [[waveform]] samples, and a sampled sound allowed for a complexity and authenticity of a real instrument that an FM simulation could not offer. For its role in being one of the first and affordable, the Amiga would remain a staple tool of early [[Music sequencer|sequenced]] music composing, especially in [[Europe]].

The Amiga offered these features before other competing home computer platforms. The Amiga's main rival, the [[Atari ST]], sourced the [[Yamaha YM2149]] [[Programmable Sound Generator]] (PSG). Compared to the in-house designed Amiga sound engine, the PSG could only handle 1 channel of sampled sound, and needed the computer's CPU to process the data for it. This made it impractical for game development use until 1989 with the release of the [[Atari STe|Atari STE]] which used DMA techniques to play back PCM samples at up to 50&amp;nbsp;kHz. The ST however remained relevant as it was equipped with a [[MIDI]] controller and external ports. It became the choice of by many professional musicians as a MIDI programming device.

[[IBM PC compatible|IBM PC clones]] in 1985 would not see any significant development in multimedia abilities for a few more years, and sampling would not become popular in other video game systems for several years. Though sampling had the potential to produce much more realistic sounds, each sample required much more data in [[Memory (computers)|memory]]. This was at a time when all memory, solid state ([[Cartridge (electronics)|cartridge]]), magnetic ([[floppy disk]]) or otherwise was still very costly per [[kilobyte]]. Sequenced soundchip generated music on the other hand was generated with a few lines of comparatively simple code and took up far less precious memory.

Arcade systems pushed game music forward in 1984 with the introduction of FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis, providing more realistic sounds than previous PSGs.  The first such game, [[Marble Madness]] used the Yamaha YM2515 FM synthesis chip.&lt;ref&gt;Grannell, Craig (August 2008). &quot;The Making of Marble Madness&quot;. Retro Gamer (Imagine Publishing) (53): 82â87.&lt;/ref&gt;

As home consoles moved into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation]], or 16-bit era, the hybrid approach (sampled and tone) to music composing continued to be used. In 1988 the [[Sega Mega Drive]] (Sega Genesis in the US) offered advanced graphics over the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and improved sound synthesis features (also using a Yamaha chip, the [[Yamaha YM2612|YM2612]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Karen|title=Game sound: an introduction to the history, theory, and practice of video game music and sound design|year=2008|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=026203378X|page=40|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnw0Zb4St-wC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but largely held the same approach to sound design. Ten channels in total for tone generation with one for PCM samples were available in [[stereo]] instead of the NES's five channels in mono, one for PCM. As before, it was often used for percussion samples, or &quot;drum kits&quot; (''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]''). The 16-bit Sega referred to was the CPU and should not be confused with 16-bit sound samples. The Genesis did not support 16-bit sampled sounds. Despite the additional tone channels, writing music still posed a challenge to traditional composers and it forced much more imaginative use of the [[Frequency modulation synthesis|FM synthesizer]] to create an enjoyable listening experience. The composer [[Yuzo Koshiro]] utilized the Mega Drive/Genesis hardware effectively to produce &quot;[[Progressive electronic dance music|progressive]], catchy, [[techno]]-style compositions far more advanced than what players were used to&quot; for games such as ''[[The Revenge of Shinobi]]'' (1989) and the ''[[Streets of Rage (series)|Streets of Rage]]'' series, setting a &quot;new high watermark for what music in games could sound like.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santos|first=Wayne|title=Songs &amp; Sounds In The 21st Century|journal=GameAxis Unwired|year=2006|month=December|issue=40|page=39|publisher=[[Singapore Press Holdings{{!}}SPH Magazines]]|issn=0219-872X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important FM synth composer was the late [[Ryu Umemoto]], who composed music for many [[visual novel]]s and [[shoot 'em up]]s during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dragon's Journey: Ryu Umemoto in Europe|author=Audun Sorlie|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/umemoto/umemoto.htm|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As cost of magnetic memory declined in the form of diskettes, the evolution of video game music on the Amiga, and some years later game music development in general, shifted to sampling in some form. It took some years before Amiga game designers learned to wholly use digitized sound effects in music (an early exception case was the title music of [[Interactive fiction|text adventure]] game ''[[The Pawn]]'', 1986). By this time, computer and game music had already begun to form its own identity, and thus many music makers intentionally tried to produce music that sounded like that heard on the [[Commodore 64]] and NES, which resulted in the [[chiptune]] genre.

The release of a freely-distributed Amiga program named ''Sound Tracker'' by Karsten Obarski in 1987 started the era of [[MOD (file format)|MOD]]-format which made it easy for anyone to produce music based on digitized samples. [[MOD (file format)|MOD]]-files were made with programs called &quot;[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]s&quot; after Obarski's ''Sound Tracker''. This MOD/tracker tradition continued with PC computers in 1990s. Examples of [[Amiga games]] using digitized instrument samples include [[David Whittaker (video game composer)|David Whittaker]]'s soundtrack for ''[[Shadow of the Beast]]'', [[Chris HÃ¼lsbeck]]'s soundtrack for ''[[Turrican|Turrican 2]]'' and [[Matt Furniss]]'s tunes for ''[[Laser Squad]]''. [[Richard Joseph]] also composed some theme songs featuring vocals and lyrics for games by [[Sensible Software]] most famous being ''[[Cannon Fodder]]'' (1993) with a song &quot;War Has Never Been So Much Fun&quot; and ''[[Sensible Soccer|Sensible World of Soccer]]'' (1994) with a song &quot;Goal Scoring Superstar Hero&quot;. These songs used long vocal samples.

A similar approach to sound and music developments had become common in the arcades by this time and had been used in many [[arcade system board]]s since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Karen|title=Game sound: an introduction to the history, theory, and practice of video game music and sound design|year=2008|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=026203378X|page=39|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnw0Zb4St-wC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was further popularized in the early 1990s by games like ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' (1991) on the [[CP System|CPS-1]], which used voice samples extensively along with sampled sound effects and percussion. [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]]'s MVS system also carried powerful sound development which often included [[surround sound]].

[[File:SNES-Mod1-Console-Set.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] (1990) brought digitized sound to console games.]]

The evolution also carried into home console video games, such as the release of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1990, and its US/EU version SNES in 1991. It sported a specialized custom [[Sony]] chip for both the sound generation and for special hardware DSP. It was capable of eight channels of sampled sounds at up to 16-bit resolution, had a wide selection of DSP effects, including a type of [[Attack-decay-sustain-release envelope|ADSR]] usually seen in high end synthesizers of the time, and full stereo sound. This allowed experimentation with applied acoustics in video games, such as musical acoustics (early games like ''[[Castlevania IV]]'', ''[[F-Zero (video game)|F-Zero]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', ''[[Gradius III]]'', and later games like ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''), directional (''[[Star Fox (SNES)|Star Fox]]'') and spatial acoustics ([[Dolby Pro-Logic]] was used in some games, like ''King Arthur's World'' and ''Jurassic Park''), as well as environmental and [[architectural acoustics]] (''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past|Zelda III]]'', ''[[Secret of Evermore]]''). Many games also made heavy use of the high quality sample playback capabilities (''[[Super Star Wars]]'', ''[[Tales of Phantasia]]''). The only real limitation to this powerful setup was the still-costly [[Semiconductor memory|solid state memory]]. Other consoles of the generation could boast similar abilities yet did not have the same circulation levels as the SNES/SFC. The [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] home system was capable of the same powerful sample processing as its arcade counterpart, but was several times the cost of a SNES. The [[Mega-CD]] (Sega-CD in the US) hardware upgrade to the Mega Drive (Genesis in the US) offered multiple PCM channels, but they were often passed over instead to use its capabilities with the cd-rom itself.

Popularity of the SNES and its software remained limited to regions where [[NTSC]] television was the broadcast standard. Partly because of the difference in frame rates of [[PAL]] broadcast equipment, many titles released were never redesigned to play appropriately and ran much slower than originally intended, or were never released. This showed a divergence in popular video game music between PAL and NTSC countries that still shows to this day. This divergence would be lessened as the fifth generation of home consoles launched globally, and as Commodore began to take a backseat to general purpose PCs and Macs for developing and gaming.

Though the Sega-CD/Mega-CD, and to a greater extent the [[PC Engine]] in Japan, would give gamers a preview of the direction video game music would take in [[Streaming media|streaming]] music, the use of both sampled and sequenced music continues in game consoles even today. The huge data storage benefit of optical media would be coupled with progressively more powerful audio generation hardware and higher quality samples in the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|Fifth Generation]]. In 1994, the CD-ROM equipped [[PlayStation]] supported 24 channels of 16-bit samples of up to 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz sample rate, samples equal to CD audio in quality. It also sported a few hardware DSP effects like [[reverb]]. Many [[Square (company)|Square]] titles continued to use sequenced music, such as ''[[Final Fantasy 7]]'', ''[[Legend of Mana]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]''. The [[Sega Saturn]] also with a CD drive supported 32 channels of PCM at the same resolution as the PSX. In 1996, the [[Nintendo 64]], still using a solid state cartridge, actually supported an integrated and scalable sound system that was potentially capable of 100 channels of PCM, and an improved sample rate of 48&amp;nbsp;kHz. Games for the N64, because of the cost of the solid state memory, typically had samples of lesser quality than the other two however, and music tended to be simpler in construct.

The more dominant approach for games based on CDs, however, was shifting toward [[Streaming media|streaming]] audio.

=== MIDI on the PC ===

[[Image:IBM PC 5150.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The first developers of [[IBM PC]] computers neglected audio capabilities (first IBM model, 1981).]]

In the same timeframe of late 1980s to mid 1990s, the IBM PC clones using the x86 architecture became more ubiquitous, yet had a very different path in sound design than other PCs and consoles. Early PC gaming was limited to the [[PC speaker]], and some proprietary standards such as the [[IBM PCjr]] 3-voice chip. While sampled sound could be achieved on the PC speaker using pulse width modulation, doing so required a significant proportion of the available processor power, rendering its use in games rare.

With the increase of x86 PCs in the market, there was a vacuum in sound performance in home computing that expansion cards attempted to fill. The first two recognizable standards were the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[MT-32]], followed by the [[AdLib]] sound card. Roland's solution was driven by [[MIDI]] sequencing using advanced LA synthesizers. This made it the first choice for game developers to produce upon, but its higher cost as an end-user solution made it prohibitive. The AdLib used a low-cost FM synthesis chip from Yamaha, and many boards could operate compatibly using the MIDI standard.

The [[AdLib]] card was usurped in 1989 by [[Creative Technology|Creative]]'s [[Sound Blaster]], which used the same Yamaha FM chip in the AdLib, for compatibility, but also added 8-bit 22.05&amp;nbsp;kHz (later 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz) digital audio recording and playback of a single stereo channel. As an affordable end-user product, the Sound Blaster constituted the core sound technology of the early 1990s; a combination of a simple FM engine that supported midi, and a DAC engine of one or more streams. Only a minority of developers ever used Amiga-style tracker formats in commercial PC games, (''[[Unreal]]'') typically preferring to use the MT-32 or AdLib/SB-compatible devices. As general purpose PCs using x86 became more ubiquitous than the other PC platforms, developers drew their focus towards that platform.

The last major development before streaming music came in 1992: [[Roland]] released the first [[General MIDI]] card, the [[wavetable]] [[SCC-1]]. The comparative quality of the samples on the wavetable spurred similar offerings from Soundblaster, but costs for both products were still high. Both companies offered 'daughter board' wavetables that could be later added to a less expensive soundcard (which only had a DAC and a MIDI controller) to give it the features of a fully integrated card. (Roland had used a similar interchangeable daughterboards in its musical instrument keyboards, also widely used to develop music at the time.)

Unlike the standards of Amiga or Atari, a PC using x86 even then could be using a broad mix of hardware. Developers increasingly used MIDI sequences: instead of writing soundtrack data for each type of soundcard, they generally wrote a fully featured data set for the Roland application that would be compatible with lesser featured equipment so long as it had a MIDI controller to run the sequence. However, different products used different sounds attached to their MIDI controllers. Some tied into the Yamaha FM chip to simulate instruments, some daughterboards of samples had very different sound qualities; meaning that no single sequence performance would be accurate to every other General Midi device.

All of these considerations in the products reflected the high cost of memory storage which rapidly declined with the optical CD format.

=== Pre-recorded and streaming music ===
{{main|Streaming audio in video games}}

Taking entirely pre-recorded music had many advantages over sequencing for sound quality. Music could be produced freely with any kind and number of instruments, allowing developers to simply record one track to be played back during the game. Quality was only limited by the effort put into mastering the track itself. Memory space costs that was previously a concern was somewhat addressed with optical media becoming the dominant media for software games. [[CD quality]] audio allowed for music and voice that had the potential to be truly indistinguishable from any other source or genre of music.

In fourth generation home video games and PCs this was limited to playing a [[Red Book (CD standard)|Red Book]] audio track from a [[Compact Disc|CD]] while the game was in play (such as ''[[Sonic CD]]''). Some of the earliest examples of Red Book audio in video games were later titles of the ''[[Ys (series)|Ys]]'' series, composed by Yuzo Koshiro and Mieko Ishikawa, and arranged by Ryo Yunemitsu for the [[TurboGrafx-CD]] from 1989. The ''Ys'' soundtracks are still regarded as some of the most influential video game music ever composed.&lt;ref name=&quot;kalata_ys&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|title=Ys|url=http://hardcoregaming101.net/ys/ys.htm|work=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=3 September 2011|date=11/27/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgfan_falcom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Falcom Classics II|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/falcomclassics2/Falcom_Classics_2-2.html|work=RPGFan|accessdate=3 September 2011|author=Ryan Mattich}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;greening_kotowski&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Yuzo Koshiro|date=February 2011|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|author=Chris Greening &amp; Don Kotowski|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/yuzokoshiro.shtml|accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were several disadvantages of regular CD-audio. Optical drive technology was still limited in spindle speed, so playing an audio track from the game CD meant that the system could not access data again until it stopped the track from playing. [[Music loop|Looping]], the most common form of game music, was also problem as when the laser reached the end of a track, it had to move itself back to the beginning to start reading again causing an audible gap in playback.

To address these drawbacks, some PC game developers designed their own [[Container format (digital)|container formats]] in house, for each application in some cases, to stream compressed audio. This would cut back on memory used for music on the CD, allowed for much lower latency and seek time when finding and starting to play music, and also allowed for much smoother looping due to being able to [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]] the data. A minor drawback was that use of compressed audio meant it had to be decompressed which put load on the CPU of a system. As computing power increased, this load became minimal, and in some cases dedicated chips in a computer (such as a sound card) would actually handle all the decompressing.

Fifth generation home console systems also developed specialised streaming formats and containers for compressed audio playback. Sony would call theirs [[Yellow Book (CD standard)|Yellow Book]], and offer the standard to other companies. Games would take full advantage of this ability, sometimes with highly praised results (''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''). Games ported from arcade machines, which continued to use FM synthesis, often saw superior pre-recorded music streams on their home console counterparts (''[[Street Fighter Alpha 2]]''). Even though the game systems were capable of &quot;CD quality&quot; sound, these compressed audio tracks were not true &quot;CD quality.&quot; Many of them had lower sampling rates, but not so significant that most consumers would notice. Using a compressed stream allowed game designers to play back streamed music and still be able to access other data on the disc without interruption of the music, at the cost of CPU power used to render the audio stream. Manipulating the stream any further would require a far more significant level of CPU power available in the 5th generation.

Some games, such as the [[Wipeout (video game series)|''Wipeout'']] series, continued to use full redbook CD audio for their soundtracks.

This overall freedom offered to music composers gave video game music the equal footing with other popular music it had lacked. A musician could now, with no need to learn about programming or the game architecture itself, independently produce the music to their satisfaction. This flexibility would be exercised as popular mainstream musicians would be using their talents for video games specifically. An early example is ''Way of the Warrior'' on the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], with music by [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]]. A more well-known example is [[Trent Reznor]]'s score for ''Quake''.

An alternate approach, as with the ''TMNT'' arcade, was to take pre-existing music not written exclusively for the game and use it in the game. The game ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter]]'' and subsequent ''Star Wars'' games took music composed by [[John Williams]] for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films of the 1970s and 1980s and used it for the game soundtracks.

Both using new music streams made specifically for the game, and using previously released/recorded music streams are common approaches for developing sound tracks to this day. It is common for X-games sports-based video games to come with some popular artists recent releases (SSX, Tony Hawk, Initial D), as well as any game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tie-in to music (''[[Need For Speed: Underground]]'', ''[[Gran Turismo (series)|Gran Turismo]]'', and ''[[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]]''). Sometimes a hybrid of the two are used, such as in ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''.

Sequencing samples continue to be used in modern gaming for many uses, mostly RPGs. Sometimes a cross between sequencing samples, and streaming music is used. Games such as ''[[Republic: The Revolution]]'' (music composed by [[James Hannigan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jameshannigan.co.uk/ |title=The official website of composer James Hannigan |publisher=Jameshannigan.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals]]'' (music composed by Bill Brown) have utilised sophisticated systems governing the flow of incidental music by stringing together short phrases based on the action on screen and the player's most recent choices (see [[dynamic music]]). Other games dynamically mixed the sound on the game based on cues of the game environment.

As processing power increased dramatically in the 6th generation of home consoles, it became possible to apply special effects in realtime to streamed audio.  In ''[[SSX]]'', a recent video game series, if a snowboarder takes to the air after jumping from a ramp, the music softens or muffles a bit, and the ambient noise of wind and air blowing becomes louder to emphasize being airborne. When the snowboarder lands, the music resumes regular playback until its next &quot;cue&quot;. The [[LucasArts]] company pioneered this interactive music technique with their [[iMUSE]] system, used in their early adventure games and the ''Star Wars'' flight simulators ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: TIE Fighter]]''. Action games such as these will change dynamically to match the amount of danger. Stealth-based games will sometimes rely on such music, either by handling streams differently, or dynamically changing the composition of a sequenced soundtrack.

=== Personalized soundtracks ===

Being able to play one's own music during a game in the past usually meant turning down the game audio and using an alternative music player. Some early exceptions were possible on PC/Windows gaming in which it was possible to independently adjust game audio while playing music with a separate program running in the background. Some PC games, such as ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', play music from the CD while retrieving game data exclusively from the hard disk, thereby allowing the game CD to be swapped for any music CD.

Some PlayStation games supported this by swapping the game CD with a music CD, although when the game needed data, you had to swap the CDs again. One of the earliest games, ''[[Ridge Racer (video game)|Ridge Racer]]'', was loaded entirely into RAM, letting the player insert a music CD to provide a soundtrack throughout the entirety of the gameplay. In ''[[Vib Ribbon]]'', this became a gameplay feature, with the game generating levels based entirely on the music on whatever CD the player inserted.

Microsoft's [[Xbox]], a competitor in the sixth generation of home consoles opened new possibilities. Its ability to copy music from a CD onto its internal hard drive allowed gamers to use their own music more seamlessly with gameplay than ever before. The feature, called Custom Soundtrack, had to be enabled by the game developer. The feature carried over into the seventh generation with the [[Xbox 360]] except it is now supported by the system software and enabled at any point.

The [[Wii]] is also able to play custom soundtracks if it is enabled by the game (''Excite Truck'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiiportal.nintendo-europe.com/9174.html |title=Nintendo Wii: Review |publisher=Wiiportal.nintendo-europe.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Endless Ocean''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/games/wii/endless_ocean_2825.html |title=Games - Endless Ocean |publisher=Nintendo |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The [[PlayStation Portable]] can, in games like ''[[Need for Speed Carbon: Own the City]]'' and ''[[FIFA 08]]'', play music from a [[Memory Stick]].

The [[PlayStation 3]] has the ability to utilize custom soundtracks in games using music saved on the hard drive, however few game developers have used this function so far. ''MLB 08: The Show'', released in North America on March 4, 2008, has a My MLB sound track feature which allows the user to play music tracks of their choice saved on the hard drive of their PS3, rather than the preprogrammed tracks incorporated into the game by the developer. An update to ''[[Wipeout HD]]'', released on the PlayStation Network, was made to also incorporate this feature.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In ''[[Audiosurf]]'', custom soundtracks are the main aspect of the game. Users have to pick a music file to be analyzed. The game will generate a race track based on tempo, pitch and complexity of the sound. The user will then race on this track, synchronized with the music.

=== Current application and future developments ===

{{listen|filename=Northern mountains.ogg|title=An example of fanfare music in video games, also from ''The Battle for Wesnoth''.|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The Xbox 360 supports [[Dolby Digital]] software, sampling and playback rate of 16-bit @ 48&amp;nbsp;kHz (internal; with 24-bit hardware D/A converters), hardware codec streaming, and potential of 256 audio simultaneous channels. While powerful and flexible, none of these features represent any major change in how game music is made from the last generation of console systems. PCs continue to rely on third-party devices for in-game sound reproduction, and SoundBlaster, despite being largely the only major player in the entertainment audio expansion card business, continues to advance its product development at a significant pace.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The PlayStation 3 handles multiple types of surround sound technology, including [[Dolby TrueHD]] and [[DTS-HD]], with up to [[7.1]] channels, and with sampling rates of up to 192&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Nintendo's [[Wii]] console shares many audio components with the [[Nintendo GameCube]] from the previous generation, including [[Dolby Pro Logic II]]. These features are extensions of technology already currently in use.

The game developer of today has many choices on how to develop music. More likely, changes in video game music creation will have very little to do with technology and more to do with other factors of game development as a business whole. As sales of video game music separate from the game itself became marketable in the west (compared to Japan where game music CDs had been selling for years), business elements also wield a level of influence that it had little before. Music from outside the game developer's immediate employment, such as music composers and pop artists, have been contracted to produce game music just as they would for a theatrical movie. Many other factors have growing influence, such as editing for content, politics on some level of the development, executive input and other elements.

== Game music as a genre ==
{{see also|Chiptune}}
{{Section OR|date=June 2009}}

Many games for the Nintendo Entertainment System and other early game consoles feature a similar style of musical composition that is sometimes described as the &quot;video game genre.&quot; Some aspects of this style continue to influence certain music today, though gamers do not associate many modern game soundtracks with the older style. The genre's compositional elements largely developed due to technological restraints, while also being influenced by [[electronic music]] bands, particularly [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (YMO), who were popular during the late 1970s to 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;/&gt; YMO sampled sounds from several [[Golden age of video arcade games|classic arcade games]] in their early albums, most notably ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in the 1978 hit song &quot;[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wire_1996&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=A-Z Of Electro|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|issue=145|month=March|year=1996|author=David Toop|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/210/|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the band would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit]] and [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit eras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=February 29, 2008|title=YMCK takes 'chiptune' revolution major|author=Daniel Robson|work=[[The Japan Times]]|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fm20080229a1.html|accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Features of the video game music genre include:

* Pieces designed to repeat indefinitely, rather than having an arranged ending or fading out.
* Pieces lacking lyrics and playing over gameplay sounds.
* Limited polyphony. Only three notes can be played simultaneously on the Nintendo Entertainment System. A great deal of effort was put into composition to create the illusion of more notes playing at once.

Although the tones featured in NES music can be thought of emulating a traditional four-piece rock band (triangle wave used as a bass, two pulse waves analogous to two guitars, and a white noise channel used for drums), composers would often go out of their way to compose complex and rapid sequences of notes, in part because of the restrictions mentioned above. This is similar to music composition during the [[Baroque]] period, when composers, particularly when creating solo pieces, focused on musical embellishments to compensate for instruments such as the [[harpsichord]] that do not allow for expressive dynamics. For the same reason, many early compositions also feature a distinct jazz influence. These would overlap with later influences from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[j-pop]] music, resulting in an equally distinct compositional style in the 16-bit era.

In an unrelated but parallel course in the European and North American developer scene, similar limitations were driving the musical style of [[home computer games]]. [[Module file]] format music, particularly [[MOD (file format)|MOD]], used similar techniques but was more heavily influenced from the electronic music scene as it developed, and resulted in another very distinct subgenre. [[Demo (computer programming)#Music|Demos]] and the developing [[demoscene]] played a big part in the early years, and still influence video game music today.

As technological limitations gradually lifted, composers were given more freedom and with the advent of CD-ROM pre-recorded soundtracks came to dominate, resulting in a noticeable shift in composition and voicing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/interviews/yokoshimomura.shtml |title=Game Music :: Interview with Yoko Shimomura (September 2009) |publisher=Squareenixmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the divisions between movies and video games has blurred, so have divisions between film scores and video game scores. Adventure and fantasy movies have similar needs to adventure and fantasy games, i.e. fanfare, traveling, hero's theme and so on. Some composers have written scores in both genres. One noted example is U.S. composer [[Michael Giacchino]] who composed the soundtrack for the game [[Medal of Honor]] and later composed for the television series such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and the score for the movies ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009).

== Video game music outside video games ==
{{see also|Chiptune}}

Appreciation for video game music, particularly music from the [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|third]] and [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth]] generations of home video game console and sometimes newer generations, continues today in very strong representation in both fans and composers alike, even out of the context of a video game. Melodies and themes from 20 years ago continue to be re-used in newer generations of video games. Themes from the original ''[[Metroid]]'' by [[Hirokazu Tanaka]] can still be heard in ''Metroid'' games from today as arranged by [[Kenji Yamamoto (composer born 1964)|Kenji Yamamoto]].

Video game music soundtracks were sold separately on CD in Japan well before the practice spread to other countries. Interpretive albums, remixes and live performances were also common variations to original soundtracks (OSTs). [[Koichi Sugiyama]] was an early figure in this practice sub-genres, and following the release of the first ''[[Dragon Warrior|Dragon Quest]]'' game in 1986, a live performance CD of his compositions was released and performed by the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]] (then later by other groups including the [[Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[NHK Symphony]]). [[Yuzo Koshiro]], another early figure, released a live performance of the ''[[Actraiser]]'' soundtrack. Both Koshiro's and fellow [[Falcom]] composer Mieko Ishikawa's contributions to [[Ys (video game)|Ys]] music would have such long lasting impact that there were more albums released of Ys music than of almost all other game-type music.

Like [[anime]] soundtracks, these soundtracks and even sheet music books were usually marketed exclusively in Japan. Therefore, interested non-Japanese gamers have to import the soundtracks and/or sheet music books through on or offline firms specifically dedicated to video game soundtrack imports. This has been somewhat less of an issue more recently as domestic publishers of anime and video games have been producing western equivalent versions of the OSTs for sale in UK and US, but only for the most popular titles in most cases.

Other original composers of the lasting themes from this time have gone on to manage symphonic concert performances to the public exhibiting their work in the games. Koichi Sugiyama was once again the first in this practice in 1987 with his &quot;Family Classic Concert&quot; and has continued concert performances almost annually. In 1991, he also formed a series called Orchestral Game Concerts, notable for featuring other talented game composers such as [[Yoko Kanno]] (''Nobunaga's Ambition'', ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms'', ''Uncharted Waters''), [[Nobuo Uematsu]] (''Final Fantasy''), Keiichi Suzuki (''Mother/Earthbound''), and Kentaro Haneda (''Wizardry'').

Global popularity of video game music would begin to surge with [[Square (company)|Square]]'s 1990s successes, particularly with ''[[Final Fantasy VI]], [[Final Fantasy VII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' by Nobuo Uematsu and with ''[[Chrono Trigger]], [[Xenogears]]'' and ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' by [[Yasunori Mitsuda]]. Compositions by Nobuo Uematsu on ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'' were arranged into ''[[Final Fantasy IV: Celtic Moon]]'', a live performance by string musicians with strong celtic influence recorded in Ireland. The Love Theme from the same game has been used as an instructional piece of music in Japanese schools. At least eight [[Music of the Final Fantasy series|''Final Fantasy'' soundtrack]] albums (''VI'', ''VII'', ''VIII'', ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy X|X]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy X|X-2]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XII|XII]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy XIII|XIII]]'') debuted in the top ten of the [[Oricon]] albums chart in Japan, where at least five of them (''VI'', ''VII'', ''VIII'', ''IX'', and ''X'') sold more than 100,000 copies each in Japan alone,&lt;ref name=&quot;sem_sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Greening|first=Chris|title=Square Enix Album Sales|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/features/editorials/salesfigures.shtml|accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oricon_ff&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author= | title= ãFF XIIIããµã¦ã³ããã©ãã¯ãåæ¥TOP3å¥ã | publisher= [[Oricon]]| date = 2010-01-28| url= http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/rankmusic/72857/| language=Japanese | accessdate = 2010-02-03}} ([http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oricon.co.jp%2Fnews%2Frankmusic%2F72857%2F&amp;act=url Translation])&lt;/ref&gt; with the best-selling [[Music of Final Fantasy VIII|''Final Fantasy VIII'' soundtrack]] selling 300,000 copies in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ff8.hoogetech.com/page.php?file=press-23nov1999.php|title=PSquaresoft Online Store Opening in Early December|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, at least eight [[Square Enix]] singles (from ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'') have sold more than 100,000 copies in Japan: &quot;[[Hikari (song)|Hikari]]&quot; (600,000), &quot;[[Eyes on Me (Faye Wong song)|Eyes on Me]]&quot; (500,000), &quot;[[Real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba]]&quot; (280,000), &quot;[[Melodies of Life]]&quot;, &quot;[[Suteki Da Ne]]&quot;, &quot;[[Passion (Hikaru Utada song)|Passion]]&quot;, &quot;[[Redemption (song)|Redemption]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Music of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series|Hoshi no Nai Sekai]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;sem_sales&quot;/&gt;

On August 20, 2003, for the first time outside Japan, music written for video games such as ''Final Fantasy'' and ''The Legend of Zelda'' was performed by a live orchestra, the [[Czech National Symphony Orchestra]] in a [[Symphonic Game Music Concert]] in Leipzig, Germany at the Gewandhaus concert hall. This event was held as the official opening ceremony of Europe's biggest trading fair for video games, the GC Games Convention and repeated in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. On November 17, 2003, Square Enix launched the ''Final Fantasy Radio'' on [[America Online]]. The radio station has initially featured complete tracks from ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XI|Final Fantasy XI: Rise of Zilart]]'' and samplings from ''Final Fantasy VII'' through ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''. The first officially sanctioned [[Final Fantasy Music Concert|Final Fantasy concert]] in the United States was performed by the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra]] at [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], on May 10, 2004. All seats at the concert were sold out in a single day. &quot;Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy&quot; followed and was performed at various cities across the United States.

On July 6, 2005, the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra also held a [[Video Games Live]] concert, which was founded by video game music composers [[Tommy Tallarico]] and [[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]] at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]. This concert featured a variety of video game music, ranging from ''Pong'' to ''[[Halo 2]]''. It also incorporated real-time video feeds that were in sync with the music, as well as laser and light special effects. Video Games Live has been touring worldwide since. On August 20, 2006, the MalmÃ¶ Symphonic Orchestra with host [[Orvar SÃ¤fstrÃ¶m]] performed an outdoor concert of game music in [[MalmÃ¶]], [[Sweden]] before an audience of 17,000, currently the attendance record for a game music concert. From April 20â27, 2007, [[Eminence Symphony Orchestra]], an orchestra dedicated to video game and anime music, performed the first part of their annual tour, the &quot;A Night in Fantasia&quot; concert series in Australia. Whilst Eminence had performed video game music as part of their concerts since their inception, the 2007 concert marked the first time ever that the entire setlist was pieces from video games. Up to seven of the world's most famous game composers were also in attendance as special guests.

Arcade game sounds had an influence on synthpop pioneers [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]],&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_ymo&quot;/&gt; who sampled ''Space Invaders'' sounds in their influential 1978 debut album, particularly the hit song &quot;[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Computer Game]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wire_1996&quot;/&gt; In turn, the band would have a major influence on much of the video game music produced during the [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit]] and [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit eras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;japantimes&quot;/&gt;

== Video game music education ==
Video game music has become part of the curriculum of traditional schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2010/01/19/berklee_is_teaching_students_to_compose_scores_for_video_games/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Joseph P. | last=Kahn | title=Why Berklee is teaching its students to compose scores for video games | date=January 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Berklee College of Music]], [[Yale University]], [[New York University]] and the [[New England Conservatory]] all feature or are adding game music to their curricula. Game sound &amp; music design has also been part of the curriculum since 2003 at the [[Utrecht School of the Arts]] (Faculty of Art, Media and Technology). Training seminars such as [[GameSoundCon]] also feature classes in how to compose video game music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/mixline/soundcon_launches_gamesoundcon_0906/ |title=SoundCon Launches Game Audio Conference for Audio Professionals |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=2009-06-05 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extracurricular organizations devoted to the performance of video game music are being established in tandem to these additions to the curriculum.  The [[University of Maryland Gamer Symphony Orchestra]] performs self-arranged video game music and the [[Video Game Orchestra]] is a semiprofessional outgrowth of students from the Berklee College of Music and other Boston-area schools.  The establishment of these groups is also occurring at the [[secondary education|secondary]] level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Post&quot;&gt;{{Cite news
