'''Radio Philippines Network, Inc. (RPN)''' is a [[Terrestrial television|broadcast]] [[television network]] in the [[Philippines]] co-owned by the Government Communications Group, [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]], Far East Managers and Investors Inc., and private sectors. This station studios are located at [[Broadcast City]], Old Balara, Capitol Hills, [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]], with transmitters at Panay Avenue, [[Quezon City]]. Founded by the late Roberto Benedicto, the TV network is the sister network of [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation or IBC]].

==History==
===As the Kanlaon Broadcasting System===
RPN was launched and granting the first broadcasting franchise on June 29, 1960 as the ''Kanlaon Broadcasting System'' (KBS). [[Kanlaon]] is a volcano on the Philippine island of [[Negros Island|Negros]], the home of Benedicto. Once granted, KBS first became a radio network with its first radio station in [[Manila]], DZBI. In 1967, KBS had grown into a full network, with seven radio stations all over the country, In 1969, KBS turned to television as KBS Television was launched with KBS-9 Manila and KBS-12 Baguio as its first stations.  Help and funding for the new TV network partly came from ABS-CBN in the form of its old headquarters along Roxas Boulevard and equipment enabling them to broadcast in color. As a result, on its launch it was named ''Accucolor 9'' (&quot;Accucolor&quot; is the name of the color technology used) as the first Philippine television network to launch in full color.

===As the Radio Philippines Network===
In 1975, KBS re-launched as RPN the Radio Philippines Network. It aired special coverages of the Olympics, Thrilla in Manila (in 1975) and the Miss Universe; and Programs such as ''[[John En Marsha]]'', ''[[Flordeluna]]'', ''[[Superstar (Philippine TV program)|Superstar]]''. The network broadcasted a daytime variety show entitled  ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]'' (premiering in 1979), and a nightly newscast titled ''[[NewsWatch (Philippine TV program)|NewsWatch]]'', alongside [[anime]] programming (making them one of the first to do so in the country) and imports from the United States. RPN-9 is the first network to cover the [[Philippine Basketball Association]] games live. In 1980, RPN-9 began to broadcast primetime programs and [[Eat Bulaga!]] (when it was still with the network) through its new domestic satellite (DOMSAT) technology in which the 1980's logo resembles a satellite antenna.

===Government sequestration and New Vision 9===
After the 1986 [[1986 EDSA Revolution|EDSA People Power Revolution]], the stock and assets of RPN, [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]] and [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]]'s BBC-2 were sequestered by the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG). President [[Corazon Aquino]] awarded BBC, through an executive order, to [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]], and RPN's and IBC's assets were turned over to the Government Communications Group. This was a period when the network lost much of its viewership to ABS-CBN and [[GMA Network|GMA Radio-Television Arts]]. By 1989, some of RPN's programming such as ''John en Marsha'', ''Student Canteen'', and ''Superstar'' were canceled, and [[TAPE Inc.|TAPE]]'s daytime programs ''Eat Bulaga!'', ''[[Agila (TV series)|Agila]]''. and ''[[Coney Reyes on Camera]]'' moved to ABS-CBN under a co-production agreement. In 1989, the network relaunched as &quot;New Vision 9&quot;, but later fell into a ratings slump due the resurgence of ABS-CBN and the recent re-launch of GMA Radio-Television Arts as [[GMA Network]]. In 1996, though, the network quickly re-gained its footing when it began to broadcast a Tagalog dub of the Mexican [[telenovela]] ''[[Marimar (telenovela)|Marimar]]'', which quickly became a popular program for the network, and setting the trend for a few years.

===Partnership with Solar===
[[File:CS9.jpg|thumb|200px|C/S9 logo used from October 4, 2008 to November 28, 2009.]]
On March 11, 2007, RPN began a partnership with the [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]], an operator of a number of cable channels in the country. The company began co-producing new programming for the network, such as a [[Philippines' Next Top Model|local version]] of ''[[America's Next Top Model]]''. The network underwent management changes on December 24, 2007, as Tonypet Albano (undersecretary and executive director of MalacaÃ±ang's Office of Political Coalition Affairs and Deputy Spokesperson of [[TEAM Unity]]) was appointed chairman of the network (replacing Education Undersecretary Mona Valisno, incumbent Presidential Assistant for Education). Undersecretary Robert Rivera was appointed director of the board, while the president and chief executive officer became former senator [[Orly Mercado|Orlando Mercado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=103411  ABS-CBN Interactive, Tonypet Albano is new RPN-9 chief]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mercado's first major move was to expand their partnerships with Solar Entertainment. Programming from Solar's cable network [[C/S (TV channel)|C/S]] was added to RPN's lineup at the beginning of the new year, and [[Philippine Basketball Association|PBA]] basketball would also return to the network beginning in the 2008-09 season, as part of a three year contract with [[Solar Sports]] after an intense bidding war with [[ABS-CBN]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBA&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=SOLAR SPORTS BAGS 3-YEAR PBA TV DEAL |url=http://www.pba.ph/content/view/2133/1/ |work= |publisher=[http://www.pba.ph PBA official website] |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080528062320/http://www.pba.ph/content/view/2133/1/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zean |last=Macamay |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Solar gets it |url=http://www.journal.com.ph/index.php?issue=2008-05-28&amp;sec=7&amp;aid=61130 |work= |publisher=[[People's Journal]] |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2008-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, RPN's stations ultimately took on the C/S name as part of their permanent branding, and rebranded itself as '''C/S 9'''. The C/S 9 name would not last, on November 29, 2009, the network re-branded again under the new name '''Solar TV''', after retiring the name for 4 years.

===Impending closure and privatization===
There were many plans that the Philippine government can offer to sell and privatize RPN and its sister station IBC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/08/10/10/pcgg-urges-gov%E2%80%99t-fast-track-sale-rpn-9-ibc-13 PCGG urges govât to fast-track sale of RPN-9, IBC-13] ''ABS-CBNnews.com.'' 2010-08-10. Retrieved 2010-08-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It was confirmed that Solar Entertainment now owns majority shares (34%) of RPN together with Roberto's daughter Kitchie (who currently runs her own production outfit Cinemakulay and was actively involved in RPN during the Marcos years).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=645563&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=66 RPN 9 a done deal?] ''philSTAR.com.'' 2011-01-06. Retrieved 2011-01-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

RPN 9 management announced that the network will sign-off on February 25. On March 2, Solar TV was replace by [[ETC (TV channel)|ETC]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/funfare/Article.aspx?articleId=660792&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=70 ETC on RPN-9 starting March 2] retrieved via www.philstar.com 02-25-2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

Employees of RPN continue to file a &quot;Notice of Strike&quot; protest against the closure which suffers [[unemployment]] and mismanagement. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/02/20/11/malacanang-sets-dialogue-rpn-9-union Malacanang sets dialogue with RPN-9 union] ''ABS-CBNnews.com.'' 2011-02-20.

Retrieved 2011-02-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Last February 25, [[Solar TV]] signed off the air to give way for the first broadcast of ETC-9.

In spite of changing the programming format, the government retained many employees of RPN even after privatization according to [[Presidential Communications Group (Philippines)#Presidential Communications Operations Office|Presidential Communications Operations Office]] (PCOO) secretary Herminio Coloma. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] decided to award a portion of the network to Far East Managers and Investors Inc. (FEMI), an organization company affiliated with the late Ambassador Roberto Benedicto. This makes the Aquino administration wanted to privatize both RPN and IBC to private sectors and retain the [[People's Television Network]] (PTV) as a sole-mandated government TV network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/214215/coloma-privatization-of-rpn-9-ibc-13-in-the-works Coloma: Privatization of RPN 9, IBC 13 in the works] ''GMANews.TV''. 03-01-2011.
