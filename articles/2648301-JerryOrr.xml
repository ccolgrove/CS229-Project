The '''Capital Beltway''' is a [[beltway]] surrounding [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States]].  It is [[concurrency (road)|co-designated]] as [[Interstate 81 in Pennsylvania|Interstate&amp;nbsp;81]] (I-81), [[Interstate 83 in Pennsylvania|I-83]], [[U.S. Route 11 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route&amp;nbsp;11]] (US&amp;nbsp;11), [[U.S. Route 322 in Pennsylvania|US&amp;nbsp;322]], and '''Pennsylvania Route&amp;nbsp;581''' (PA&amp;nbsp;581) at various locations along the route. The beltway is primarily located in the suburbs of Harrisburg; however, part of its southern leg passes along the southern edge of [[Downtown Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|downtown]].  The southwestern section of the highway is named the '''Harrisburg Expressway'''.  All of the beltway was complete by 1995; however, it was not designated as the Capital Beltway until 1997.

==Route description==
The Capital Beltway begins at the interchange of the eastern terminus of PA&amp;nbsp;581 and [[Interstate 83 in Pennsylvania|I-83]] {{convert|2|mi|km}} west of [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] in [[Lemoyne, Pennsylvania|Lemoyne]].  This junction is colloquially known as the &quot;York split&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asheharrisburg.org%2Fnewsletters%2FASHEProfile_April07.pdf |title=The Profile |accessdate=2007-12-24 |format=PDF |work=ASHE Harrisburg }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the split, the beltway crosses the [[Susquehanna River]] on the [[John Harris Bridge]], connecting Harrisburg to its west shore (a colloquialism of the western bank of the Susquehanna across from Harrisburg) suburbs of the city.  

Continuing on I-83, the beltway parallels Paxton Street (formerly [[U.S. Route 322 in Pennsylvania|US&amp;nbsp;322]]), passing the Harrisburg Mall as the road approaches the [[Eisenhower Interchange]].  At the junction, the Capital Beltway continues on I-83 as it turns north, while beginning a concurrency with US&amp;nbsp;322.  Continuing for three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km), I-83 ends at [[Interstate 81 in Pennsylvania|I-81]] at an interchange locally known as the &quot;81/83 split&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc27.com/news/stories/0807/449446.html |title=Fatal Crash Closes Interstate 81 for Nine Hours |accessdate=2007-12-24 |date=2007-08-22 |work=ABC27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080329195059/http://www.abc27.com/news/stories/0807/449446.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc27.com/news/stories/0807/449463.html |title=Police Charge Truck Driver for Deadly Crash on Interstate 81 |accessdate=2007-12-24 |date=2007-08-22 |work=ABC27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080329195548/http://www.abc27.com/news/stories/0807/449463.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  US&amp;nbsp;322 and the Capital Beltway continue on I-81 south.  

On I-81, US&amp;nbsp;322 exits off I-81 at exit&amp;nbsp;67B, heading in a northerly direction to [[State College, Pennsylvania|State College]], beginning a concurrency with US&amp;nbsp;22 west. Exit&amp;nbsp;67A is for US&amp;nbsp;22 east, Cameron Street, which is where the Farm Show Arena Complex is located (a half mile south of the beltway).  The Capital Beltway crosses the Susquehanna the second time on the [[George N. Wade Memorial Bridge]].  The beltway makes a southerly turn just beyond the bridge, near the western end of the Susquehanna Water Gap of [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]]. 
 
Continuing on I-81 until exit&amp;nbsp;59, the Capital Beltway exits onto PA&amp;nbsp;581, also known as the Harrisburg Expressway.  US&amp;nbsp;11 begins a concurrency with PA&amp;nbsp;581 starting at exit&amp;nbsp;3, and then exits off and starts a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 15|US&amp;nbsp;15]] in [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania|Camp Hill]], at the Camp Hill Shopping Center (formerly Camp Hill Mall).  The beltway continues for two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) until it completes the loop by reaching I-83 at the York split.

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
The I-81 and I-83 sections of the beltway were both fully completed by the 1970s. A expressway connecting I-81 to I-83 had been planned, and the portion of the highway from the York split to US&amp;nbsp;11 and US&amp;nbsp;15 in Camp Hill was completed in 1992. It became known as the Harrisburg Expressway, and it was given the PA&amp;nbsp;581 designation. The section from Camp Hill to I-81 remained incomplete until 1995 when construction began on the segment. It was finally completed and opened for public use in 1997. The PA&amp;nbsp;581 designation was extended northwestward to the interchange with I-81 when it opened. The Capital Beltway designation was assigned to its current alignment at this time. Engineering for the project was provided by [[Gannett Fleming]] of Camp Hill.
