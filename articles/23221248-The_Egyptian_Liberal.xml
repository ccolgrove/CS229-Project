The castle was built by the Hugues II and Hugues III, Lords of Farcheville and Bouville. The great hall was built in 1291 and the castle chapel was consacrated in 1304. Both father and son were [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] to [[Philip IV of France]]. The structure possesses a rare northern French example of arched [[machicolations]] on buttresses, more characteristic of military architecture in the [[Languedoc]]. The castle passed to the family of ChÃ¢tillon in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mesqui  | first = Jean  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Chateaux-forts et fortifications en France  | publisher = Flammarion  | year = 1997  | location = Paris  | pages = 493 pp  | url =  | doi =  | isbn = 2-08-012271-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The castle was once owned by [[Yellowstone Club]] founders Edra and [[Tim Blixseth]]. Following the Blixseth's 2009 divorce and bankruptcy, the castle is currently for sale by creditors for $57 million U.S. dollars. The castle has its own moat, hunting grounds, 15 bedrooms, {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}, and a [[helipad]] &lt;ref&gt;http://offshoreinn.com/international_real_estate_property/castle-for-sale-chateau-de-farcheville/&lt;/ref&gt;. Edra Blilxseth is facing [[personal bankruptcy]] because of the collapse of her and her husband's real estate empire. [[Edra Blixseth]] is now facing paying creditors over $400,000,000.
