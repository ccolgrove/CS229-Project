In many respects IUPUI was established long before its 1969 merger. The historically most prestigious portions of IUPUI are the professional graduate schools and the art school: [[Indiana University School of Medicine]], [[Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law]], [[Indiana University School of Liberal Arts]], the Indiana University School of Dentistry, and the Indiana University Herron School of Art, all of which were established decades prior to the 1969 merger into one institution. The School of Medicine and School of Dentistry are the only degree-granting [[public university]] programs of medicine and dentistry in Indiana and have been since becoming part of Indiana University.

The vision for an IUPUI first was inspired by the formation of the Indiana Purdue Foundation in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] in 1958 for the creation of what has become [[IPFW]]. Fort Wayne's Indiana Purdue Foundation is unrelated to IUPUI, but the formation of such a joint venture between Indiana's two largest university systems inspired metropolitan and state government leaders in Indianapolis to consider the same type of merger for their disparate Indiana University professional graduate schools, Indiana University undergraduate extension center, and Purdue University undergraduate extension center.

The School of Medicine's large campus west of downtown Indianapolis was chosen to be the site of what was to become IUPUI. Prior to forming IUPUI, other Indiana University and Purdue University schools were located at various locations within and near downtown Indianapolis. With the formation of IUPUI and the relocation of those academic units to the IUPUI campus adjoining the School of Medicine's Medical Center, some of those academic units for the first time were housed in buildings designed at time of construction for academic use, instead of business-office buildings as had been the case previously for the undergraduate extension centers.

==Athletics==
{{Main|IUPUI Jaguars}}

IUPUI's teamsâthe IUPUI Jaguarsâcompete at the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level in [[The Summit League]]. The Jaguars have earned NCAA Tournament bids in [[NCAA Men's Soccer Championship|Men's Soccer]], Men's Golf, [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Men's Basketball]] and Women's Tennis, as well as a Mid-Continent Conference (now The Summit League) championship in [[Volleyball]] and [[Men's Tennis]]. Nine athletes have been recognized as Mid-Con Athletes of the Year, with seven coaches earning Coach of the Year honors. Prior to 1995, the teams were known as the Metros and were [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]].

IUPUI's athletic teams have also excelled in the classroom. The women's tennis team has been chosen as an All-Academic Team by the [[Intercollegiate Tennis Association]] for three consecutive years; collectively, they have maintained an almost C-average for those three years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} The men's cross country team has been recognized by the [[United State Cross Country Coaches Association]] as Academic All-American the past two seasons, while the womenâs team earned the same honor from the [[Women's Intercollegiate Cross Country Coaches Association]] twice. In 2001-02, the women's basketball team was selected by the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] to its Top 25 Honor Roll. In the fall of 2002, the athletic department as a whole was honored by [[USA Today]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] for having the highest improvement in graduation rate in the country for its category. In 2003, the athletic department as a whole was honored by [[USA Today]] once again for having the largest discrepancy in graduation rates from the athletics department and general student population.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

The campus is home to the [[Indiana University Natatorium]], host of numerous national swimming championships, and the [[IU Michael A. Carroll Track &amp; Soccer Stadium|Michael A. Carroll Stadium]], home of the 2006 &amp; 2007 USA Track &amp; Field Championships. Additionally, the 1987 Pan-American Games were hosted on the IUPUI campus, while IUPUI also served as the annual site for the Nike All-America Basketball Camp until 2007. The Indianapolis Tennis Center is also on the IUPUI campus and has served, since 1979, as the home of the Indianapolis Tennis Championships (formerly the RCA Championships). In 2010 The Indianapolis Tennis Center was closed ,and demolished.

==Campus==
[[Image:IUPUI-Cavanaugh-trees.JPG|thumb|left|Cavanaugh Hall]]
The IUPUI campus covers {{convert|510|acre|km2}} and is located just west of downtown near the [[Indianapolis Zoo]], Downtown Canal Walk, and [[White River State Park]]. It is adjacent to the Indiana Avenue cultural district. In 2004 &amp; 2005, new residence halls, the Informatics, Communication &amp; Information Technology Building (ICTC), and Eskenazi Hall, the new home of the [[Herron School of Art|Herron School of Art &amp; Design]] were completed on campus. The zip code for the entire campus is 46202.

A new Campus Center was opened in Spring 2008. The Campus Center Boasts a {{convert|179|ft|m|adj=on}} bell tower made of limestone and glass. The Campus Center houses Enrollment Services, the IUPUI bookstore, Financial Aid, Scholarships, campus dining, game rooms, a theatre, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~sldweb/campus-center|title=IUPUI Campus Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new {{convert|254000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} research building, Research III, was completed in 2008. It is a {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} research complex with direct connections to Research II and the IU Cancer Research Institute. It is also a skyway connection to the [[Indiana University Health People Mover]].

Campus housing has the capacity for 1,060 students in a traditional residence hall (Ball Residence) and the Campus Apartments on the River Walk, which opened in 2004. Another residence hall is going to be built in order to accommodate 1,000 more students.

Ralph D. Gray's book ''IUPUIâThe Making of an Urban University'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2003) is a comprehensive published account of the history of the campus.

===Library===
The [[IUPUI University Library]] has developed comprehensive programs in the areas of Information Literacy and Digital Libraries.  It is also home to the Ruth Lilly Special Collections and Archives and the leading collection for the study of Philanthropy in the world, the Joseph and Matthew Payton Philanthropic Studies Library.  The Herron Art Library at the Herron School of Art and Design at IUPUI is a full-service branch of the University Library.
