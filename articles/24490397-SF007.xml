== Corporate history ==
Originally founded in 1985 as LAN Systems, the companyâs software product assets were acquired by [[Intel]] in 1991, forming Intelâs LANDesk division.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = From Intel To Independence &amp;mdash; How Joe Wang is transforming LANDesk | first = TC | last = Doyle | publisher = VARbusiness | date = September 1, 2003 | page = 114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

LANDesk pioneered the desktop management category in 1993.  That same year, IDC named LANDesk the category leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = IT Management | url = http://www.itmanagement.com/vendors/landesk-profile/ | series = Vendors | title = LANDesk profile}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, LANDesk pioneered virtual IT technology in 1999, revolutionizing large-packet distribution with LANDesk Targeted Multicast technology.

In 2002, LANDesk Software became a standalone company with headquarters near [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = LANDesk eases hardware upgrade pains | first = Matt | last = Hamblen | publisher = [[Computerworld]] | date = May 12, 2003 | page = 6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 2005, the companyâs software was being used worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Desktop-Management im Vergleich &amp;mdash; Mit den Administrationsprodukten von Altiris, Enteo, Landesk und Microsoft lassen sich viele Routineaufgaben in der IT-Verwaltung einfacher erledigen | language = German | title = Computerwoche | year = 2005 | volume = 32 | issue = 19 | page= 24}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Avocent]] purchased the company for $416 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Infoworld | title = In Brief: Avocent to buy LANDESK for US$416M | date = April 27, 2006 | url = http://infoworld.com/article/06/04/27/77825_HNavocentbrief_1.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2006, LANDesk added process management technologies to its product line and extended into the consolidated service desk market with LANDesk Service Desk. 

In August 2008 Avocent acquired Touchpaper, [[ITSM]] vendor to merge within LANDesk division.  In December 2009 [[Emerson Electric]] acquired Avocent to merge within its Network Power division.  LANDesk split from Avocent to become an independent business unit.  In February 2010 Emerson stated its intention to sell LANDesk during first half of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = First quarter 2010 results reported | url = http://www.emerson.com/en-US/news_center/news_releases/Pages/Emerson-First-Quarter-2010-Earnings-Results.aspx | publisher = Emerson | year = 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerson announced in the first quarter 2010 report, that the LANDesk business unit of Avocent was not a strategic fit for Emerson and expected it to be sold within six months. Therefore, the results of LANDesk were being reported as discontinued operations.

On the 23rd of August, 2010, [[Thoma Cressey Bravo|Thoma Bravo LLC]] announced their intention to acquire LANDesk to establish as independent company.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.thomabravo.com/news/463 | title = Thomabravo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
