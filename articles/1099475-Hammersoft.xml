'''The Movie Network''' is a [[Canadian]] [[English language]] [[Category A services|Category A]] [[premium television]] service, owned by [[Astral Media]]. The service is licensed to operate east of the [[Ontario]]-[[Manitoba]] border, excluding the territories. The name was formerly abbreviated to TMN, which remains a common informal name and is therefore used below for brevity.

The Movie Network is carried by various Canadian [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] providers in [[Eastern Canada]] including [[Bell TV]], [[Shaw Direct]], [[Rogers Cable Inc.|Rogers Digital Cable]], [[VidÃ©otron]], [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]], [[Cogeco]] and more.  It is the equivalent of [[Movie Central]], which is available in western Canada.

==History==
In 1976, Communications Minister [[Jeanne SauvÃ©]] was quoted as saying &quot;(Canadian) pay television is inevitable&quot;. During the 1970s when premium pay-TV service [[HBO]] and the then up-and-coming Superstation [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]] became available on satellite in North America, some Canadians who were living in underserved rural areas, wanted access to these services. The [[Saskatchewan]] government together with [[Access Communications|Cable Regina]] set up a provincial pay-TV network called '''Teletheatre''' in 1979.

Growth of grey market [[TVRO]] dishes by 1980 led the government of [[Pierre Trudeau]] to allow for pay television in Canada, and that there would be hearings to licence Canadian pay television networks. In September 1981, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) held a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] in [[Hull, Quebec]] to licence Canada's first pay-television networks. There were more than 24 applicants.

A pay-TV license was issued by the CRTC to '''First Choice Canadian Communications Corp.''' on March 18, 1982. When First Choice, as TMN was then known, was launched on February 1, 1983, it was a national pay-TV service. The first movie ever to air on First Choice (now TMN) was ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''. The movie aired following a replay of [[The Who]]'s farewell tour concert special and a two-hour promo for First Choice announcing the programming it would carry; the airing of The Who concert which had been aired live on other channels the year before, as well as the two-hour promotional ad had several critics wondering about the channel's claims that it would be commercial-free and not play reruns. At 7 a.m. PST, First Choice aired ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and would continue to play the film again every other day for eight hours. The service was offered as a free 14-day preview, then scrambled exclusively to the subscribers who wanted to pay extra.

After a disappointing run for pay services in general, the industry was restructured and First Choice was restricted to eastern Canada, with competitor Superchannel (now [[Movie Central]]) taking territorial rights in the west. Both services briefly used the '''First Choice-Superchannel''' name.  In the [[1980s in television|1980s]], First Choice took the slogan &quot;The Movie Network&quot;, which became the name of the channel itself in [[1993 in television|1993]].

[[Image:Firstchoice 1983logo.jpg|right|thumb|160px|First Choice pay-tv logo from [[1983 in television|1983]]-[[1992 in television|1992]].]]
The channel also applied for a license and owned a [[French-language]] channel called Premier Choix, which merged with another (Quebec-based) pay-television network TVEC, to form [[Super Ãcran]], which is still in operation today.

=== Ownership ===
When First Choice initially made its application to the CRTC in September 1981, the following individuals and companies were part of the proposed channel:

* Donald Sobey - of the [[Sobeys]] supermarket chain
* J. R. McCaig
* Norman Keevil
* Royfund Equity Ltd. - [[Royal Bank of Canada]] mutual fund division
* AGF Management Ltd. 
* [[Manulife|Manufacturers Life Insurance Co.]]

Together, they had $19 million in [[Ownership equity|equity]] financing and proposed to spend $310.4 million over five years on Canadian television production. Estimated profit (over five years) would be $3.1 million; today, The Movie Network is owned by [[Astral Media]] of [[Montreal]].

=== Management ===
* Donald MacPherson, First Choice President 1983-1984
* [[Harold Greenberg]], First Choice President 1984-1996

== Channels and content ==
The Movie Network consists of a total of five 24-hour multiplex channels and two high definition channels. TMN operates as a separate service with a separate licence then its sister network, [[Mpix]], although often Mpix is sold together in a package with The Movie Network.&lt;ref&gt;http://gettmn.ca/signup;jsessionid=46AFD9CBCCB3D71A9564568D9C548E67&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Eastern Canada map.png|right|frame|230px|Broadcast area (in green) for The Movie Network]]

===List of channels===
* '''The Movie Network''' or '''M''': the main &quot;flagship&quot; channel that offers films, documentaries and TV series including content from the American pay service [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], along with Canadian programming.
* '''MFun!''': airs comedic and light-hearted films, specials and series.
* '''MFest''':  airs independent and foreign films.
* '''MExcess''': offers action &amp; adventure films, TV series and late-night adult content.
* '''HBO Canada''': offers original programming sourced from American premium service HBO.
* '''The Movie Network OnDemand''': is a subscription [[video on demand]] service delivering select content from TMN and all of its multiplex channels.

[[High-definition television|High definition]] feeds are available for M (whose HD feed launched in May 2005), MFun, MExcess, and HBO Canada.

Programs broadcast on TMN are rated according to the [[Ontario Film Review Board]].

===HBO Canada===
On September 22, 2008, both TMN and [[Movie Central]] announced they would jointly begin offering a dedicated HBO multiplex channel (in both standard definition and [[high definition television|high definition]] formats), called '''HBO Canada''', on October 30. For TMN subscribers, HBO Canada replaced MMore and MMore HD. For Movie Central subscribers, HBO Canada replaced Movie Central 4 and Movie Central 1 HD. The channel remains available at no additional charge to TMN / Movie Central subscribers and, moreover, is not available on a stand-alone basis.

[[File:HBO Canada logo.svg|150px|right|thumb|Logo of HBO Canada.]]  The channel focuses on programming from the U.S. premium service [[HBO]], including several HBO series, specials and sporting events not previously available in Canada; however, some programs that have aired on HBO Canada have actually aired in the United States on HBO's rival [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. A selection of Canadian films and series also airs to satisfy [[Canadian content]] requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;announce&quot;&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2008/22/c6918.html Astral/Corus press release], September 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; HBO programming eventually airs solely on HBO Canada, as opposed to any of the other TMN / Movie Central multiplex channels.

The HBO Canada schedule is common to both services, with the exception of Eastern (TMN) / Mountain (MC) timeshifting. Although essentially operating as a joint venture of Astral and Movie Central's parent company [[Corus Entertainment]], the east and west feeds are technically separate channels wholly owned by the parent company of the applicable regional service. In any event, HBO's parent company [[Time Warner]] is not a shareholder, and only [[brand licensing|licenses the name]] to Astral and Corus. Unlike the other multiplex channels offered by TMN and MC, both the standard-definition and high-definition HBO Canada feeds (East/West) are available nationally to those television providers who wish to carry them.

== Programming ==
Before other Canadian specialty networks like [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[MuchMusic]] were licensed, First Choice was the network for watching premium (commercial-free) professional sporting and concert events. Sports came from such sources as [[ESPN]], [[USA Network]], and [[HBO]].

Before the advent of [[Multichannel television sound|stereo]] television and [[home cinema|home theatre]] systems we have today, subscribers who paid for [[cable FM]] service could receive a stereo feed of First Choice.

Its slogan was: &quot;Look out for number one! Look out for First Choice!&quot;

== Controversy ==
First Choice originally aired programming from the American [[Playboy Channel]]. [[Feminist]] groups voiced their opposition to this.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} First Choice aired a two-hour block of Playboy programming during a late night time slot on Friday during its first year.

== Pricing ==
When First Choice applied to the CRTC, they initially estimated that to program major American movies, entertainment specials and Canadian movies and specials, pay for satellite time, and marketing of the channel, they could sell it to the cable companies at a wholesale rate of $7.50/month.  However, by the time the channel launched, and the cable companies had their take of the pay-TV pie, the retail cost of First Choice jumped significantly to $15.95.

== Duopoly issue ==
For many years, the ''de facto'' [[monopoly|twin regional monopolies]] of The Movie Network and Movie Central has been subject to criticism. At the time, no other similar premium services broadcasted within Canada. Critics argued that this limits competition and consumer choice, while proponents say there is very little in content or functionality that it is not already offered by the existing services.

In July 2005, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), the Canadian federal broadcast regulator, announced that public hearings would begin on October 24, 2005 on four broadcast group applications for new national pay TV licences. Each applicant said they would commit towards the creation of more Canadian program content.

On May 18, 2006, it was announced that the ''Allarco Entertainment'' application was accepted, while the other three were rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2006/db2006-193.htm CRTC Decision 2006-193]&lt;/ref&gt; This approved application effectively ended The Movie Network/Movie Central duopoly in Canada. On November 2, 2007, the new service launched as [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]].
