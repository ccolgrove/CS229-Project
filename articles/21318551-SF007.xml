'''Electronic commerce''', commonly known as '''e-commerce''', '''eCommerce''' or '''e-comm''', refers to the buying and selling of [[product (business)|product]]s or [[Service (economics)|service]]s over electronic systems such as the Internet and other [[computer network]]s. However, the term may refer to more than just buying and selling products online. It also includes the entire online process of developing, marketing, selling, delivering, servicing and paying for products and services. The amount of trade conducted electronically has grown extraordinarily with  widespread Internet usage. The use of commerce is conducted in this way, spurring and drawing on innovations in [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Internet marketing]], [[online transaction processing]], [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[inventory management]] systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] at least at one point in the transaction's life-cycle, although it may encompass a wider range of technologies such as [[e-mail]], mobile devices and telephones as well.

A large percentage of electronic commerce is conducted entirely in electronic form for [[virtual]] items such as access to premium content on a website, but mostly electronic commerce involves the transportation of physical items in some way. Online retailers are sometimes known as [[e-tailer]]s and online retail is sometimes known as '''e-tail'''. Almost all big retailers are now electronically present on the [[World Wide Web]].

Electronic commerce that takes place between businesses is referred to as [[business-to-business]] or B2B. B2B can be open to all interested parties (e.g. [[commodity exchange]]) or limited to specific, pre-qualified participants ([[private electronic market]]). Electronic commerce that takes place between businesses and consumers, on the other hand, is referred to as [[business-to-consumer]] or [[B2C]]. This is the type of electronic commerce conducted by companies such as [[Amazon.com]]. [[Online shopping]] is a form of electronic commerce where the buyer is directly online to the seller's computer usually via the internet. There is often no intermediary service involved, and the sale or purchase transaction is completed electronically and interactively in real-time. However in some cases, an intermediary may be present in a sale or purchase transaction, or handling recurring or one-time purchase transactions for online games.

Electronic commerce is generally considered to be the sales aspect of [[e-business]]. It also consists of the exchange of data to facilitate the financing and payment aspects of business transactions.

==History==
===Early development===
Originally, electronic commerce was identified as the facilitation of commercial transactions electronically, using technology such as [[Electronic Data Interchange|Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)]]. These were both introduced in the late 1970s, allowing businesses to send commercial documents like purchase orders or invoices electronically. The growth and acceptance of credit cards, automated teller machines (ATM) and telephone banking in the 1980s were also forms of electronic commerce. Another form of e-commerce was the airline reservation system typified by Sabre in the USA and Travicom in the UK.

From the 1990s onwards, electronic commerce would additionally include [[enterprise resource planning]]  systems (ERP), [[data mining]] and [[data warehousing]].

In 1990, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[WorldWideWeb]] [[web browser]] and transformed an academic telecommunication network into a worldwide everyman everyday communication system called internet/www. Commercial enterprise on the [[Internet]] was strictly prohibited by NSF until 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]: [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/tech.html?pg=2 We Are the Web] [[Wired magazine]], Issue 13.08, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Internet became popular worldwide around 1994 with the adoption of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser, it took about five years to introduce security protocols and [[DSL]] allowing continual connection to the Internet. By the end of 2000, many European and American business companies offered their services through the [[World Wide Web]]. Since then people began to associate a word &quot;[[ecommerce]]&quot; with the ability of purchasing various goods through the Internet using secure protocols and electronic payment services.

==Governmental regulation==
{{globalize|United States|date=March 2011}}
In the United States, some electronic commerce activities are regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).  These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer [[privacy]].  The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm |title= Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumersâ personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/promises.html |title= Enforcing Privacy Promises: Section 5 of the FTC Act |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to address [[Online pharmacy|online pharmacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6353&amp;tab=summary |title= H.R. 6353: Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 |publisher= [[Govtrack]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
Contemporary electronic commerce involves everything from ordering &quot;digital&quot; content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to &quot;meta&quot; services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce.

On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. Data integrity and security are very hot and pressing issues for electronic commerce.

==Global trends==
Business models across the world also continue to change drastically with the advent of eCommerce and this change is not just restricted to USA. Other countries are also contributing to the growth of eCommerce. For example, the United Kingdom  has the biggest e-commerce market in the world when measured by the amount spent per capita, even higher than the USA. The [[internet economy]] in UK is likely to grow by 10% between 2010 to 2015. This has led to changing dynamics for the advertising industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/oct/28/net-worth-100bn-uk/|title=news|publisher=Guardian.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst emerging economies, China's eCommerce presence continues to expand. With 384 million internet users,China's online shopping sales rose to $36.6 billion in 2009 and one of the reasons behind the huge growth has been the improved trust level for shoppers. The Chinese retailers have been able to help consumers feel more comfortable shopping online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/18/china-internet-commerce-markets-equities-alibaba.html/|title= China's migration to eCommerce|newspaper=Forbes.com|date=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-Commerce has become an important tool for businesses worldwide not only to sell to customers but also to engage them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=Andreas B. |last2=Kretschmer |first2=Tobias |year=2008 |title=In E-Commerce, More is More |journal=Harvard Business Review |volume=86 (March) |pages=20â21 |url=http://hbr.org/2008/03/in-e-commerce-more-is-more/ar/1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on markets and retailers==
Economists have theorized that e-commerce ought to lead to intensified price [[competition (economics)|competition]], as it increases consumers' ability to gather information about products and prices. Research by four economists at the University of Chicago has found that the growth of online shopping has also affected industry structure in two areas that have seen significant growth in e-commerce, [[book selling|bookshops]] and [[travel agencies]]. Generally, larger firms have grown at the expense of smaller ones, as they are able to use [[economies of scale]] and offer lower prices. The lone exception to this pattern has been the very smallest category of bookseller, shops with between one and four employees, which appear to have withstood the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Economics focus: The click and the dead|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16478931|newspaper=The Economist|date=July 3â9, 2010|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution channels==
E-commerce has grown in importance as companies have adopted Pure-Click and [[Bricks and clicks|Brick and Click]] channel systems. We can distinguish between pure-click and brick and click channel system adopted by companies.

* Pure-Click companies are those that have launched a website without any previous existence as a firm. It is imperative that such companies must set up and operate their e-commerce websites very carefully. Customer service is of paramount importance.
* Brick and Click companies are those existing companies that have added an online site for e-commerce. Initially, Brick and Click companies were skeptical whether or not to add an online e-commerce channel for fear that selling their products might produce channel conflict with their off-line retailers, agents, or their own stores. However, they eventually added internet to their distribution channel portfolio after seeing how much business their online competitors were generating.
