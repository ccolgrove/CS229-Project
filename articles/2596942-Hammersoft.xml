The videography of American recording artist [[Britney Spears]] consists of thirty-two [[music videos]], four [[home video]]s, two [[concert|concert tour videos]], one [[compilation album|music video compilation]], and two [[documentary|documentaries]]. In 1997 Spears signed a recording contract with [[Jive Records]]. Spears' first music video &quot;[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]&quot;, in which she chose to dress as a Catholic schoolgirl, propelled her to superstardom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ranked number one on [[Total Request Live|TRL's]] Final Countdown of the most iconic music videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/11/review-trls-tot.html | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|title=Show Tracker|first=Robert|last=Lloyd| date=2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for the lead single from Spears' second album, &quot;[[Oops!...

&quot;[[Me Against the Music]]&quot;, which featured [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], was released in 2003. Director [[Paul Hunter]] talked to [[MTV News]] about the video, saying, &quot;Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation.

In the hospital, doctors fail to resuscitate her while a child is born in the next room, implying she has been reincarnated. The original treatment would have had Spears killing herself from a drug overdose, but the plot was removed after it received criticism by several organizations, who perceived it as a glamorization of suicide. Featuring many religious references, the music video was noted by contemporary critics for predicting Spears's future struggles with fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|2009|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bestmtv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Montgomery|first=James |title=Is Britney Spears' 'If U Seek Amy' Her Best Video Ever? |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1606882/20090312/spears_britney.jhtml | work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=MTV| date=2009-03-12 | accessdate=2009-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;everytimerstone&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=The Complete Video Guide: &quot;Everytime&quot;|year=2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Jann Wenner|accessdate=2010-03-13|issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clip for Spears' cover of &quot;[[My Prerogative]]&quot; was described the video as &quot;[having] an element of old Hollywood glamour and mystery&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;prerogative&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1490551/20040825/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney To Marry Kevin Federline In 'My Prerogative' Video|date=2004-08-25|accessdate=2010-03-19| last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video begins with Spears driving erratically in a [[Porsche]] and crashing it into a pool.&lt;ref name=&quot;prerogative2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1490312/20040817/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Makes Party-Crashing Her Prerogative In Next Video|date=2004-08-17|accessdate=2010-03-19| last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
