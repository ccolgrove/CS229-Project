In 2000, the School of Arts and Sciences of the university, which comprises the College and the Graduate School, restructured into the four Loyola Schools of Humanities, Management, Science and Engineering, and Social Sciences. The School of Social Sciences is the biggest school of the university in terms of population. The first and incumbent dean of the school is Fr. JosÃ© M. Cruz, S.J., a Jesuit historian. The departments of the school used to be housed at the Social Sciences Building of the university, except for the Communication Department, which was housed beside the LS Covered Courts and the Manila Observatory. The Ricardo and Dr. Rosita Leong Hall, which is the school's present main building, was inaugurated in 2007. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=120&amp;type=2&amp;aid=4326&lt;/ref&gt; The Social Sciences Building now houses the Communication and Education Departments, the Psychology Department Laboratories, and several classrooms and offices. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=120&amp;type=2&amp;aid=5679&lt;/ref&gt;
