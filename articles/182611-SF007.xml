He moved his capital to [[Pavia]] in 540&lt;ref&gt;[[Herwig Wolfram]], ''History of the Goths'' (University of California Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;, conquered [[Treviso]], installing his nephew [[Totila]] as commander, and soon controlled [[Venetia (region)|Venetia]] and [[Liguria]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ildibald reigned for only about a year before being killed by a [[Gepid]] at a palace banquet. After a brief interlude under [[Eraric]], he was succeeded by his nephew Totila.

Ildibad was a nephew of [[Theudis]], one of the Visigothic kings in [[Spain]]. This relationship led Peter Heather to suggest that both belonged to a powerful, non-royal clan.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Heather, ''The Goths'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1996), p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;
