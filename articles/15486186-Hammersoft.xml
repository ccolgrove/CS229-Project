<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="15486186" ns="0" title="Discography of FLCL"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''music of FLCL''' was written and performed by [[The Pillows]], which has generated mass success and appreciation since the series' release abroad. The ending theme is The Pillows' &quot;[[Ride on Shooting Star]]&quot;. The remaining music was written by [[Shinkichi Mitsumune]]. Two soundtrack CDs &amp;mdash; ''[[Addict (soundtrack)|Addict]]'' and ''[[King of Pirates]]'' &amp;mdash; and a one-CD &quot;best-of&quot; compilation (''[[FLCL No. 3]]'') were released in Japan and later in America.

Another interesting note is that the action sequences were choreographed around the individual tracks used, and not the other way around. The song [[Little Busters]] plays when Canti taps into Atomsk's power. There are also many references to guitars, which are used symbolically and physically (though rarely musically) throughout the series.
