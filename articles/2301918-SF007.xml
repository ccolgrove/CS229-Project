He was born in Chia-ying, now [[Mei County, Guangdong]], and died 57 years later in the same place.

==Biography==
Huang was a government official who worked as a diplomat but is remembered today for his poetry. His diplomatic duties took him to [[Japan]], the [[United States]], [[England]] and [[Singapore]] wherein he collected materials for his poems. He created a literary breakthrough by studying speech  and folk songs of the common people in his home town of Chia-ying, and incorporating them into his poetry.

While Huang was a councilor to He Ruzhang, the Qing dynasty's first envoy to Japan in September 1880, he was ordered to compile a policy paper for the visiting Korean reformist [[Kim Hongjip]] with recommendations for Korea's foreign policy.  This important document, known as the Chaoxian Celue (J: ChÅsen Sakuryaku K:Choseon Chekryak) advised Korea to strengthen itself through reform and, &quot;Keeping close to China, Creating ties with Japan, and allying with the United States.&quot;  The document was presented to the Korean government upon Kim Hongjip's return and may have been one of the key inspirations for reforms in Korea from 1881 onwards.
