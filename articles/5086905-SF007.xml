'''McAfee VirusScan''' is an [[antivirus software|antivirus]] program created and maintained by [[McAfee Inc.]] (formerly known as [[Network Associates]]). McAfee markets VirusScan to home and home-office users; McAfee also develops ''VirusScan Enterprise'' for use in corporate environments. The product is not available as a standalone package, but is included in the ''McAfee VirusScan Plus'' package or as part of ''McAfee Internet Security Suite.'' McAfee also produces a similar product for [[Mac OS X]] under the name of ''VirusScan for Mac''. Additionally, [[BSkyB]] and McAfee have produced a &quot;[[Sky Broadband]]&quot; branded version of VirusScan, offered free to [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Digital]] customers upon broadband modem installation.

==Features==
The 2010 edition of VirusScan Plus integrates antivirus, [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] and anti-[[spyware]] capabilities.

It includes, amongst other things;

* On-access file scanner (McAfee OAS)
* Inbound and outbound firewall protection
* Spyware protection
* Daily definition updates
* McAfee ''X-Ray'' [[rootkit]] detection
* McAfee ''SiteAdvisor'' - displays a safety rating for websites based on tests for evidence of [[e-mail spam|spam]], [[malware]] and [[phishing]]
* McAfee ''SystemGuards'' - monitors a computer for activity that may be caused by virus infection or hacker activity(discontinued: see below)

*In the upgraded release in February 2010 McAfee discontinued SystemGuards in favor of its Active protection(Artemis), which detects suspicious activity in real-time and contacts McAfee labs to determine whether the file is a threat. Artemis was released around August 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcafee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcafee.com/us/about/press/corporate/2008/20080908_180000_q.html |title=&quot;McAfee Press Release&quot; |publisher=Mcafee.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VirusScan Plus 2010 is compatible with [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] only.

==VirusScan Enterprise==
McAfee also produces an enterprise-level product named VirusScan Enterprise: McAfee has designed this for use on larger networks. It contains features intended to make management of antivirus software on multiple computers easier. Unlike the home-user edition, it consists of a client application - loaded on all networked computers - and a server application, through which the system installs signature and application updates and configures settings for all client programs.  Clients can be controlled with the ePolicy Orchestrator, which is a unified console (it can control VirusScan and other McAfee products).

==VirusScan for Mac==

==Criticism==
In tests by [[Virus Bulletin]] and other independent consumer-organizations, McAfee virus scan has not fared well, frequently failing to detect some common viruses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/results?display=tests Virus Bulletin] {{registration required}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A review of VirusScan 2006 by [[CNET]] criticized the product due to &quot;pronounced performance hits in two of our three real-world performance tests&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tedja |first=Irsan |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/McAfee_VirusScan_2006/4505-3681_7-31473526-2.html |title=McAfee VirusScan 2006 Reviews - Cnet.com |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some users reviewing the same product reported encountering technical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tedja |first=Irsan |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/McAfee_VirusScan_2006/4852-3681_7-31473526.html?tag=uoreturn |title=McAfee VirusScan 2006 Ratings - Cnet.com |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some older versions of the VirusScan engine use all available CPU cycles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dundee.ac.uk/ics/documents/virus/viruswinvs451readme.txt VirusScan 4.5.1 release notes]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2009}} McAfee virus-scanning products did not handle false positives well, repeatedly removing or quarantining known clean files even after the user restores them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computershopper.com/software/reviews/mcafee-total-protection-2009 |title=Computer Shopper Review |publisher=Computershopper.com |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have described customer support for McAfee products as lacking, with support staff slow to respond and unable to answer many questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com/mcafee-review.html |title=TopTen Reviews |publisher=Anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adwarereport.com/mt/archives/mcafee_virusscan_plus_review.php Adware Support review]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 21, 2010, beginning approximately at 2 PM GMT, an erroneous virus definition file update from McAfee affected millions of computers worldwide running Windows XP Service Pack 3. The update resulted in the removal of a Windows system file (&lt;code&gt;[[svchost.exe]]&lt;/code&gt;) on those machines, causing machines to lose network access and, in some cases, to enter a reboot loop. McAfee rectified this by removing and replacing the faulty DAT file, version 5958, with an emergency DAT file (version 5959) and has posted a fix for the affected machines in its consumer &quot;KnowledgeBase&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=8656|title=McAfee DAT 5958 Update Issues|date=21 April 2010|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/21/mcafee-update--shutting-down-xp-machines/|title=Botched McAfee update shutting down corporate XP machines worldwide|date=21 April 2010|accessdate=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
