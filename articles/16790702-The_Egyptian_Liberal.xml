Using [[Facebook]], blogs, SMS, independent media and word-of-mouth, activists and workers in Egypt sought to organize strikes, protests and demonstrations throughout the country on April 6. Calling it the &quot;Egyptian Intifida,&quot; supporters called for civil disobedience, asking everyone to stay home from work and avoid making purchases. The strike began as an initiative of the workers of [[El-Mahalla El-Kubra]] but was picked up, promoted and expanded by activists using the Internet and cell phones. [[April 6 Youth Movement]], a group on the social networking site Facebook, attracted more than 64,000 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazz&quot; /&gt; Although the banned [[Islamist]] organization the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] did not officially support the strike, it did not prevent its members from participating, and several Muslim Brotherhood activists and bloggers supported the strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arab-media.blogspot.com/2008/04/using-facebook-blogs-sms-independent.html &quot;April 6th General Strike in Egypt Draws Together Diverse Groups Using Newest Technologies.&quot; ''Arab Media Blogspot,'' April 2, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;. The night before, Malek&lt;ref&gt;[http://malek-x.net/ Malek-X Web site.]&lt;/ref&gt; an Egyptian blogger, and three activists from the [[Islamic Labour Party]] were arrested for posting fliers about the strike.

The text of the call for strike read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;All national forces in Egypt have agreed upon the 6th of April to be a public strike. On the 6th of April, stay home, do not go out; Donât go to work, donât go to the university, donât go to school, donât open your shop, donât open your pharmacy, donât go to the police station, donât go to the camp; We need salaries allowing us to live, we need to work, we want our children to get education, we need human transportation means, we want hospitals to get treatment, we want medicines for our children, we need just judiciary, we want security, we want freedom and dignity, we want apartments for youth; We donât want price increases, we donât want favouritism, we donât want police in plain clothes, we donât want torture in police stations, we donât want corruption, we donât want bribes, we donât want detentions. Tell your friends not to go to work and ask them to join the strike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-lab.net/blog/2008/03/23/egyptian-intifada/ &quot;Egyptian Intifada,&quot; ''News Lab,'' March 23, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The strike at Mahalla was to have begun at 7 a.m. but plain clothes security personnel and police infiltrated the factory and allegedly intimidated workers from striking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=12933 Sarah Carr, &quot;Two allegedly killed during violent clashes in Mahalla,&quot; ''Daily News Egypt,'' 6 April 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of plainclothes security men took control of the Mahalla textile factories before work began, seizing workers and forcing them to work. At the end of the day, police escorts led small groups of workers out of the factories in an attempt to discourage mass protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nouri&quot;&gt;[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnL06488125.html Nasser Nouri, &quot;Clashes in Nile Delta After Strike Aborted,&quot; ''Reuters,'' 6 April 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; This led some in the press to call the strike a failure and many left the region (about an hour outside Cairo) before any violence started.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=12918 Rania Al Malky, &quot;Reflections: Bread or freedom?&quot;, ''Daily News Egypt,'' 6 April 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;.
