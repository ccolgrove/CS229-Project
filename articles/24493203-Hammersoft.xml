'''Our Lady of Mount Carmel Learning Center, De La Salle Supervised''', also known as ''Mount Carmel La Salle'' or simply ''Mount Carmel'',  is a [[private school|private]] [[catholic]] elementary&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pia.gov.ph/?m=12&amp;fi=p080430.htm&amp;no=83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usls.edu.ph/index.cfm/usls-supervised-schools/the-supervised-schools/&lt;/ref&gt; school run under the direct supervision of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]]/[[De La Salle Brothers Philippines|De La Salle Brothers]] of the [[University of St. La Salle]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usls.edu.ph/index.cfm/usls-supervised-schools/the-supervised-schools/&lt;/ref&gt;, therefore part of the worldwide network of [[La Sallian educational institutions | LaSallian educational institutions]]. It is located in Calipayan Road, Punta Tabuc, [[Roxas City]], [[Capiz]], [[Philippines]]. Originally named ''Mt. Carmel Family Life Learning Center'', the school started as a preschool for indigent children at the residence of Atty. Virginia PatiÃ±o with only 8 students. It later transferred to its current site in Punta Tabuc after the school was able to purchase land and was able to receive a grant from a German foundation.

==History==
[[Image:OLMCLC 1990's elementary students.jpg|thumb|220px|OLMCLC 1990's elementary students]]

In response to the suggestion of Sor Paula Vargas of [[St. Anthony College| St. Anthony College Hospital]] to build a school for indigent children, Atty. Virginia PatiÃ±o founded '''Mount Carmel Family Life Learning Center''' with the solicited support and commitment of the religious and civic-spirited individuals of the [[Christian Family Movement]]

This noble goal of building a school was realized through the selfless effort of Mr. and Mrs. Braulio A. PatiÃ±o and other members who worked without compensation. These significant persons were Atty. Elias Conlu, Mrs. Elnoria Barrios, Mrs. Ofelia Rendon, Mrs. Rebecca Berjamin, Mrs. Fe Villarruz, Atty. Mike Orillos, Mrs. Divina Villarruz-Asis, Mrs. Lilia Orola, Mrs. Corazon Ortiz, Mrs. Luisa Posadas, Mrs. May Abella-Vito, Mrs. Terry Beldia and Atty. Nema Aguilar. 

In 1988, two rooms in the ground floor of Atty. PatiÃ±o's house were converted into improvised classrooms. Nursery and Kinder classes started with two teachers, Ms. Vivian Abagatnan and Ms. Ariza Villanueva who were later joined by Ms. Glosan Avelino. It started with eight children. three were indigent and five were paying. In the second year of operation, the number of students were more than doubled.

Inspired with the blossoming of the school, Atty. PatiÃ±o spent a few months for compiling and consolidating document with pictures showing the actual situation of street children. These were sent to a foundation in [[Germany]] together with a project proposal.

After almost a year or two, all the hard work, prayers and sacrifices of the people who worked hard for the school finally paid up with the response of '''Bund der Deutschen Katholischen Jugend Papstliches Mission Work der Kinder''', a German foundation donated a substantial amount to the school.

The Money was used for the construction of two buildings with four rooms each. The school site is actually a lot offered at a very low price by Mr. Candelario PatiÃ±o. The money from the sold lot was donated by the lot owner for the construction of the road going to the school. Later, an additional lot was donated by the same lot owner in exchange of the adjoining lot owned by Mrs. Paz Altavas where the road going to school lies.

In this new site, the Preparatory class and the newly opened Grade 1 which was handled by Mrs. Gloria Andrada, were housed. Out of the solicited money, a second hand mini-school bus was bought and the rest were allocated for salaries and other operating expenses. From then on, one Grade was added after the other end of the every school year. More teachers were hired and more classrooms were built.

In 1995, Our Lady of Mount Carmel Learning Center became a La Salle school under the supervision of the [[University of St. La Salle]] with Mrs. Norma Tagle as the supervisor. The elementary level was completed in 1997 and the first graduation ceremony was held in March 1997.

June 1997 was another year for the school as it marked the inclusion of the first year High School for its courses. In June 2000, the Board of Trustees decided to turn over the management of its high school to the '''University of St. La Salle- Affiliate College''' (which later renamed as ''La Salle Affiliate College'' and subsequently [[College of St. John-Roxas]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philippinecompanies.com/companyprofile/54689/college-of-st-john-roxas&lt;/ref&gt;) due to the growing number of students and limited space of its school. Mount Carmel La Salle decided to retain and maintain its Pre-School and Grade School.
