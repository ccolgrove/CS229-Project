'''Bassim Abbas Gatea Al-Ogaili''' ({{lang-ar|'''Ø¨Ø§Ø³Ù Ø¹Ø¨Ø§Ø³ ÙØ§Ø·Ø¹ Ø§ÙØ¹ÙÙÙÙ'''}}, born July 1, 1982 in [[Iraq]]) ''simply known as'' '''Bassim Abbas''', is an [[Iraq]]i professional [[football (soccer)|footballer]]. He currently plays as a defender for [[Konyaspor]] football club in [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/en/spieler/114859/basem-abbas-kati/profil.html transfermarkt]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Iraq national football team]].

==Information==
The Bagdad club [[Al-Talaba]] has long been renowned for its ability to develop and nurture young talent. One player to have benefitted from their youth system is Basem Abbas, who over recent years has blossomed into one of Iraq's most dependable defenders. 

Born in July 1982, Abbas's playing career was punctuated by three separate stints with [[Al Talaba]]. After spending his first four years with âthe Students' while he honed his craft, he made a high-profile move to Iranian giants [[Esteghlal Ahvaz]] in 2004. Within a year, though, he had returned to Al Talaba, where played for another season. He then went on to play for three other clubs ([[Nejmeh]], [[Al-Arabi SC (Qatar)|Al-Arabi Sports Club]], [[Umm-Salal]] ).
until his journey came full circle and he began a third spell in 2008.

However, after his great performance in the [[FIFA Confederations Cup 2009]], he moved to the Turkish team [[Diyarbakirspor]].

Along the way, the many clubs that pursued Abbas were drawn to his inspirational play. A technically accomplished defender who can surge powerfully down the flank to create goalscoring opportunities, he is also powerful and uncompromising in the tackle. 

Abbas first made his mark on the international scene as a cornerstone of Iraq's defence in their triumphant AFC Youth Championship campaign in 2000. He was also instrumental in his side's semi-final showing at the Olympic Football Tournament [[Athens 2004]], and later went on to play an integral role in Iraq's run to continental glory at the [[AFC Asian Cup 2007]] and was a part of the national team in 2009 [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] .

Bassim Abbas signed a two year contract to [[Konyaspor]] at the end of 2009-2010 season.
