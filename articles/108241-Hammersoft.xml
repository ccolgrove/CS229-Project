==History==
[[Image:Photo-CA-rohnertpark.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Rohnert Park Expressway, Rohnert Park, California]]
Originally home of the [[Coast Miwok]] native people,&lt;ref&gt;Access Genealogy&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mexican government]] granted [[Rancho Cotate]] to Captain Juan Castaneda in July 1844 for his military services in the region.  The grant encompassed present-day [[Penngrove, California|Penngrove]], [[Cotati, California|Cotati]] and Rohnert Park. &quot;Cotate Rancho is a part of the Vallejo Township which is the plain between Sonoma Mountain and Petaluma Creek [[San Pablo Bay]], and an east and west line dividing the tract from [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]] Township.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;DeClercq&quot;&gt;DeClercq, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;&gt;Harris, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rancho Cotate was sold in 1849 to Dr. Thomas S. Page, of Cotati, and eventually broken up and sold off piecemeal to incoming settlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeClercq&quot; /&gt;  The town of Rohnert Park was named after the Rohnert family who owned the ''Rohnert Seed Farm''. In 1929, a successful businessman, Waldo Emerson Rohnert, (born  1869 - died 1933), a native of [[Detroit, Michigan]], purchased a large ranch here and minimized flooding in the fields with a crude drainage system but died shortly after. His son, Fred Rohnert, a graduate of [[Stanford Law School]] took over the ranch and developed a seed growing business, the ''Rohnert Seed Farm'', which turned into a major horticultural success for the county.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeClercq&quot; /&gt;

In the year 1956, only four adult residents lived within the district boundaries, but in 1957 with the [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|101 Freeway]] newly  completed at the Cotati bypass, Rohnert Park began to be built and laid out as a [[planned city]].  In a summer election of 1962, Rohnert Park was incorporated, comprising {{convert|1325|acre|ha}}, housing an estimated 2,775 persons, the first town in Sonoma County to incorporate since 1905. The historic neighboring town of [[Cotati, California]] voted to incorporate the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeClercq&quot; /&gt;

==Education==
