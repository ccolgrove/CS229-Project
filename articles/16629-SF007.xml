'''KDE''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|k|eÉª|d|iË|Ë|iË}}) is an international [[free software]] community producing an integrated set of [[cross-platform]] applications designed to run on [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and Mac OS X systems. It is best known for its [[KDE Plasma Workspaces|Plasma Desktop]], a [[desktop environment]] provided as the default working environment on many Linux distributions, such as [[Kubuntu]], [[Pardus (operating system)|Pardus]] and [[openSUSE]].&lt;ref&gt;

The goal of the community is to provide basic desktop functions and applications for daily needs as well as tools and documentation for developers to write stand-alone applications for the system. In this regard, the KDE project serves as an umbrella project for many standalone applications and smaller projects that are based on KDE technology. These include [[Calligra Suite]], [[digiKam]], [[Rekonq]], [[K3b]] and many others.

KDE software is based on the [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] framework. The original [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] version of this toolkit only existed for the [[X11]] platform, but with the release of Qt 4, [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]] versions are available for all platforms. This allows KDE software based on Qt 4 to also be distributed to Microsoft Windows and [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[Image:Matthias Ettrich LinuxTag 2005-06-23.jpg|150px|thumb|Matthias Ettrich, Founder of KDE]]
KDE was founded in 1996 by [[Matthias Ettrich]], who was then a student at the [[Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen]]. At the time, he was troubled by certain aspects of the [[Unix]] desktop. Among his concerns was that none of the [[application software|applications]] looked, felt, or worked alike. He proposed the creation of not merely a set of applications but a desktop environment in which users could expect things to look, feel, and work consistently. He also wanted to make this desktop easy to use; one of his complaints about desktop applications of the time was that his girlfriend could not use them. His initial [[Usenet]] post spurred a lot of interest, and the KDE project was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Project: Kool Desktop Environment (KDE)&quot;&gt;
{{cite newsgroup

The name ''KDE'' was intended as a wordplay on the existing [[Common Desktop Environment]], available for Unix systems. CDE was an X11-based user environment jointly developed by HP, IBM, and Sun through the [[X/Open]] consortium, with an interface and productivity tools based on the [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] graphical widget toolkit. It was supposed to be an intuitively easy-to-use desktop computer
environment.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=COSE Update FYI
|accessdate= 2010-11-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''K'' was originally suggested to stand for &quot;[[wiktionary:kool|Kool]]&quot;, but it was quickly decided that the K should stand for nothing in particular. The ''KDE'' initialism is therefore expanded to ''&quot;K Desktop Environment&quot;''.

=== Product releases ===
{{main|KDE Software Compilation}}

Matthias Ettrich chose to use [[Trolltech|Trolltechâs]] Qt framework for the KDE project.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programmers quickly started developing KDE/Qt applications, and by early 1997, a few applications were being released. On 12 July 1998 the first version of the desktop environment, called KDE 1.0, was released.

=== Licensing ===
In November 1998, the Qt framework was dual-licensed under the [[free and open source software|free and open source]] [[Q Public License]] (QPL) and a commercial license for proprietary software developers. The same year, the KDE Free Qt foundation was created which guarantees that Qt would fall under a variant of the very liberal [[BSD license]] should Trolltech cease to exist or no free version of Qt be released during 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=KDE Free Qt Foundation
|publisher=KDE
|accessdate=2010-11-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debate continued about compatibility with the GNU General Public License (GPL), hence in September 2000 Trolltech made the Unix version of the Qt libraries available under the GPL in addition to the QPL which eliminated the concerns of the [[Free Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| accessdate=2010-11-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trolltech continued to require licenses for developing [[proprietary software]] with Qt. The core libraries of KDE are collectively licensed under the GNU LGPL but the only way for proprietary software to make use of them was to be developed under the terms of the Qt proprietary license.

Starting with Qt 4.5, Qt was also made available under the LGPL version 2.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; now allowing proprietary applications to legally use the open source Qt version.

=== Brand repositioning ===
On 24 November 2009 the KDE Marketing Team announced an official [[rebranding]] of the KDE project components, motivated by the perceived shift from building a desktop environment to a complete project around a community of &quot;people who create software&quot;. The rebranding focused on de-emphasizing the desktop environment as  &quot;just another product&quot;, and emphasizing both the community and the other technologies provided as KDE software. After the repositioning, the name ''KDE'' no longer stands for ''K Desktop Environment'', as it now acts as an umbrella brand for software produced by the community. What would have been previously known as KDE 4.4 will now be referred as &quot;KDE Software Compilation 4.4&quot; (abbreviated &quot;KDE SC 4.4&quot;). Regardless, many users still refer to it as KDE 4.&lt;ref&gt;

This campaign promotes the idea of becoming a supporting member for individuals. It is made available for those who would like to support KDE, but do not have enough time to do so. [[Georg Greve]], founder of the [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE) was first to 'join the game'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Local community ===
In many countries, KDE has local branches. These are either informal organizations (KDE India) or like the KDE e.V., given a legal form (KDE France). The local organizations hosts and maintains a regional website, and organising local events, such as tradeshows, contributor meetings and social community meetings.

[[Image:KDE-AR Official Logo.png|right|80px|thumb|KDE-AR Logo]]
KDE-AR (KDE Argentina) is the group of KDE developers and users in Argentina, was officially opened in 22 November 2008 at the meeting in IRC channel. They can organize release parties on holidays to celebrate released of new version of the KDE SC since 4.2. KDE-AR has their own mailing lists and IRC channel.

KDE Brasil is composed by several local groups in Brazil, like KDE-MG, Live Blue, KDE PiauÃ­, and KDE-RS. The main goals of local groups are regional promotion and direction of contributions of members, and still maintaining harmony with the KDE Brazil community. KDE-MG is a local group in [[Minas Gerais]]. The idea of structuring the group was arose during the FISL (FÃ³rum Internacional Software Livre) 10. Live Blue is a KDE working group in [[Bahia]]. KDE PiauÃ­ is a group of users and contributors of KDE in the [[PiauÃ­]]. The ideia was born during the Software Freedom Day Teresina 2009 and has concretized during the Akademy-Br 2010, where the group was officially created. KDE-RS is a group of KDE users from [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. KDE Lovelace is a Brazilian female group of users and contributors in KDE.

KDE EspaÃ±a was registered as an association under the Spanish law in 2009. The aim is stimulating the development and use of the KDE software in Spain. The supreme governing body is general assembly, which is ordinary or extraordinary. The ordinary general assembly is held at least once a year. The extraordinary general assembly is held as necessary. The board consists of president, vice president, secretary, treasurer and members. Current board are Albert Astals Cid (president), Alejandro Fiestas Olivares (vice president), Aleix Pol i GonzÃ lez (secretary), and JosÃ© MillÃ¡n Soto (treasurer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Communication ===
The communication within the community takes place via mailing lists, IRC, blogs, forums, news announcements, [[wiki]]s, and conferences. The community has the ''Code of Conduct'' for acceptable behaviour within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.kde.org/code-of-conduct/
|title= KDE Community Code of Conduct
|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mailing list]]s are one of the main communication channels, and most problems are discussed on here. The community has several mailing lists, has two general user lists: ''Kde'' for discussion of users, and ''Kde-announce'' for version updates, security patches and other changes. And two general development lists: ''Kde-devel'', for communication of application developers, and ''Kde-core-devel'' for communication of development of [[KDE Platform]]. Many applications also have specific mailing lists.

KDE Community Forums is also activity in discuss. The forums have ''Brainstorm'' for user submit ideas to developers. The wish can be approved or disapproved by other users. Every few months, the highest-voted features will then be submitted to the developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The KDE software labels are used by producers of software to show that they are part of the KDE community or that they use the KDE Platform. There are three labels available. The ''Powered by KDE'' label is used to show that an application derives its strength from the KDE community and from the KDE development platform. The ''Built on the KDE Platform'' label indicates that the application uses the KDE platform. The ''Part of the KDE family'' label is used by application authors to identify themselves as being part of the KDE community.&lt;ref&gt;

Many KDE applications have a ''K'' in the name, mostly as an initial letter. The ''K'' in many KDE applications is obtained by spelling a word which originally begins with ''C'' or ''Q'' differently, for example [[Konsole]] and [[Kaffeine]]. Also, some just prefix a commonly used word with a ''K'', for instance [[KGet]]. Among KDE SC 4 applications and technologies, however, the trend is not to have a ''K'' in the name at all, such as [[Calligra Stage|Stage]] and [[Dolphin (software)|Dolphin]].

Like many free/open source software projects, KDE is primarily a volunteer effort, although various companies, such as [[Novell]], [[Nokia]], and [[Mandriva]], employ developers to work on the project. Since a large number of individuals contribute to KDE in various ways (e.g. code, translation, artwork), organization of such a project is complex.

=== Development ===
The overall direction of the [[KDE Platform]] is made on the ''KDE Core Team''. These are developers who have made significant contributions to KDE over a long period of time. This team communicates using the ''kde-core-devel'' mailing list, which is publicly archived and readable, but joining requires approval. KDE does not have a single central leader who can veto important decisions. Instead, the KDE core team consisting of several dozen contributors takes decisions. The decisions do not take a formal vote, but through discussions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| url = http://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/management.php
| title = Project Management
| accessdate = 2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Developers also organize alongside topical teams. For example, the ''[[KDE Education Project|KDE Edu team]]'' develops free educational software. While these teams work mostly independent and do not all follow a common release schedule. Each team has its own messaging channels, both on IRC and on the mailinglists. And they have mentor program which helps beginner to get start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Currently KDE community uses the [[Git (software)|Git]] repository. KDE Projects site gives an overview of all projects within Git repository. QuickGit is another repository browser. It shows all the git repositories. ReviewBoard site gives patch review. Commitfilter will send an email with each commit for the projects you want to watch, without either getting tons of mails or getting infrequent and redundant information. English Breakfast Network (EBN) is a collection of machines that do automated KDE source artifact quality checking. The EBN provides KDE API documentation validation, user documentation validation, source code checking. It is operated by [[Adriaan de Groot (Software developer)|Adriaan de Groot]] and Allen Winter. Commit-Digest site gives a weekly overview of the development activity. LXR indexes classes and methods used in KDE.

Season of KDE (SoK) is a program for people could not get accepted into Google Summer of Code. They will have a mentor from the KDE community to help them if any question arises or if they do not know how to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The KDE e.V. helps travel and accommodation subsidies for presenters, BoF leaders, organizers or  core contributor. It is held in the North America since 2009.

In January 2008, KDE 4.0 Release Event was held at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, USA to celebrate the release of KDE SC 4.0. The community realized that there was a strong demand for KDE events in the Americas, therefore Camp KDE was produced.

Camp KDE 2009 was the premiere meeting of the KDE Americas, was held at the Travellers Beach Resort in Negril, Jamaica, sponsored by Google, Inte, iXsystem, KDE e.V. and Kitware. The event included 1-2 days of presentations, BoF meetings and [[hackathon]] sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Developer Sprints ===
In addition to ''Camp KDE'' and ''Akademy'' there are other conferences, which is called ''Developer Sprints''. The Developer Sprints are focused gatherings of developers to work on a specific part of KDE. Usually there are 2â3 days meetings of around 10-15 people. The Developer Sprints include core people, but also least one or two newbie quota to get fresh developers into the community. They are supported by KDE e.V. financially and organizationally. It will also provide help and advice where needed and appropriate. The results of meetings are documented on the [[KDE Dot News|KDE.News]]. They also create a sprint landing page on the community wiki, which give a brief summary of the sprint and link to relevant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Technology platform ==
[[Image:KDE brand map.svg|right|300px|thumb|KDE brand map]]
The KDE technology platform consists of three parts: KDE Development Platform, KDE Workspace and KDE Applications.

=== KDE Platform ===
[[KDE Platform]] consists of the libraries and services needed to run KDE applications. libraries include: [[Solid (KDE)|Solid]], [[NEPOMUK (framework)|Nepomuk]], [[Phonon (KDE)|Phonon]], etc. Packages include: kdelibs, kdepimlibs and kdebase-runtime. The libraries must be licensed under one of the LGPL, BSD license, [[MIT License]] and X11 license.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url= http://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Policies/Licensing_Policy
|title= KDE Licensing Policy
|accessdate=2010-11-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Platform is mainly written in C++, it includes bindings for other programming languages.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plasma Workspaces ===
[[File:Screenshot of KDE 4.4 plasma-netbook.png|thumb|250px|KDE Plasma Netbook]]
The [[KDE Plasma Workspaces|Plasma Workspaces]] provide the environment for running and managing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.kde.org/workspaces/
|title= The KDE Workspaces
|accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include many components such as [[KWin]], [[KDE Display Manager|KDM]], Plasma core libraries, [[Klipper]], [[KDE System Guard|KSysguard]], and [[System Settings]]. There are different available [[GUI]] environments: ''Plasma Desktop'' for desktop computers, ''Plasma Netbook'' for netbooks, ''Plasma Mobile'' for smartphones and ''Plasma Tablet'' for Tablet PCs.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== KDE Applications ===
[[List of KDE applications|KDE Applications]] are built on top of the KDE Platform like [[Okular]], [[KTorrent]], [[Kexi]] and [[KDE Partition Manager]]. KDE applications can potentially be portable between operating systems and independent of a particular workspace or desktop environment. Some brands identify application suites built up from several applications, such as [[Kdenetwork|KDE Network]], [[Kdegraphics|KDE Graphics]] and [[Kdeutils|KDE Utilities]]. Some applications are part of the regular Software Compilation releases, others are part of Extragear and release to their own schedule.

== Implementation ==
Most KDE software uses the Qt framework which runs on most Unix and [[Unix-like]] systems, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows. {{As of | 2011}} [[CMake]] serves as the build tool. This allows KDE to support a wider range of platforms, including Microsoft Windows.&lt;ref&gt;

* [[KDE Software Compilation]]: KDE Software Compilation (KDE SC) is the coordinated releases of new software versions, gathering elements from the previous components to build an integrated core of software. The KDE SC is not a product as a single entity.
* [[Calligra Suite]]: Integrated office suite.
* [[Kdewebdev|KDEWebdev]]: Web development tools.
* [[Extragear|KDE-Extragear]]: Extragear is a collection of applications associated with KDE. Those applications are not part the official software compilation, but they are still part of the project.
* KDE-Playground: This package contains pre-release and unstable software. It is a place for applications to mature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Collaborations with other organizations ==
=== Wikimedia ===
{{wikinews|Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales announces cooperation between KDE Group and Wikimedia}}
[[image:Amarok 2 3 0.png|right|200px|thumb|Amarok with information retrieved from Wikipedia.]]

On 23 June 2005, chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation announced that the KDE community and the Wikimedia Foundation have begun efforts towards cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title= KDE and Wikipedia Announce Cooperation

On 4 April 2008, the [[KDE e.V.]] and Wikimedia Deutschland have opened shared offices in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| url  = http://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-and-wikimedia-collaborate.php

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009 KDE e.V. moved to shared offices with [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] in Berlin, so Wikimedia Foundation now uses the Frankfurt offices for themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsfeoffice&quot; /&gt;

=== Free Software Foundation Europe ===
In May 2006, KDE e.V. became an ''Associate Member'' of the [[Free Software Foundation Europe]] (FSFE).&lt;ref name=&quot;fsfeoffice&quot;&gt;
{{cite web
| url = http://www.kde.org/announcements/fsfe-associate-member.php
| date = May 9, 2006
| title = KDE e.V. Becomes Associate Member of FSFE
| accessdate=2010-11-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2008, KDE e.V. and FSFE announced that after working with FSFEâs ''Freedom Task Force'' one and a half years KDE adopts FSFEâs ''Fiduciary Licence Agreement''. Using that, KDE developers can â on a voluntary basis â assign their copyrights to KDE e.V.&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate=2010-11-06

In September 2009, KDE e.V. and FSFE moved into shared offices in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial enterprises ===
Several companies actively contribute to KDE, like Collabora, Erfrakon, Intevation GmbH, Kolab Konsortium, KlarÃ¤lvdalens Datakonsult AB (KDAB), and KO GmbH.

Nokia use [[Calligra Suite]] as base for their ''Office Viewer'' application for [[Maemo]]/[[MeeGo]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

| publisher = KDE
| date = 2010-01-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been contracting KO GmbH to bring MS Office 2007 file format filters to Calligra.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

| author = Inge Wallin
| date = 2009-10-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nokia also employs several KDE developers directly â either to use KDE software for MeeGo (e.g. ''KCal''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or as sponsorship.

The software development and consulting companies Intevation GmbH of Germany and the Swedish KDAB use Qt and KDE software â especially [[Kontact]] and [[Akonadi]] for [[Kolab]] â for their services and products, therefore both employ KDE developers.

=== Others ===
KDE participates in [[freedesktop.org]], an effort to standardize Unix desktop interoperability.

Since 2009, [[GNOME]] and KDE co-host their conferences Akademy and [[GNOME_Users_And_Developers_European_Conference|GUADEC]] every two years under the ''Desktop Summit'' label.

In December 2010 KDE e.V. became a licensee of the [[Open Invention Network]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Linux distribution]]s and other free operating systems are involved in the development and distribution of the software, and are therefore also active in the KDE community. These include commercial distributors such as Novell, Mandriva, Red Hat, or Canonical, but also government-funded non-commercial organizations such as the [[Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey]] with its Linux distribution Pardus.

== Notable uses ==
Brazilâs primary school education system operates computers running KDE software, includes more than 42,000 schools in 4,000 cities, serving nearly 52 million children. The base distribution is called Educational Linux, which is based on Kubuntu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Germany uses KDE software in its embassies around the world, representing around 11,000 systems. Through use of Pardus, a local Linux distribution, many sections of the Turkish government make use of KDE software, including the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]&lt;ref name =&quot;radikal&quot;&gt;{{Cite web
