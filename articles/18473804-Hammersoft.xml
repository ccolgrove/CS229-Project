[[File:AU Main Building, Manila.jpg|left|thumb|Arellano University at present.]]

Arellano University was created through the initiative of Florentino Cayco, Sr., the first Filipino Undersecretary of Public Instruction and an educator. On 1938, he established the Arellano Law College&lt;ref name=&quot;AU,Main&quot;/&gt; in [[Intramuros]].&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;AU Campus&quot;/&gt; The university closed on December 1941 to 1945 because of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese invasion in the Philippines]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name= &quot;AUHistory&quot;/&gt; It reopened on April 1945 and was renamed as Arellano Colleges.&lt;ref name= &quot;AUHistory&quot;/&gt; On June 1946, Cayco became the first [[President of Arellano University]] and through his efforts Arellano Colleges became Arellano University on February 22, 1947. Arellano University moved it site on Plaza Guipit on 1948 before being relocated back to [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AUSL&quot; /&gt; On 1954, Arellano University opened an institute of nursing and later a law school,&lt;ref name= &quot;AUHistory&quot;/&gt; followed by the other institutes, and since has expanded into six constituent universities which was named after several [[National hero of the Philippines|national heroes]] of the [[Philippines]] as follows; &lt;!-- Arellano University â Andres Bonifacio Campus--&gt;Andres Bonifacio, &lt;!--Arellano University â Apolinario Mabini Campus--&gt;Apolinario Mabini, [[Arellano University â Jose Abad Santos Campus|Jose Abad Santos]], [[Arellano University â Elisa Esguerra Campus|Jose Rizal]], Juan MarquezâSumulong, and [[Arellano University â Plaridel Campus|Marcelo H. del Pilar]].

Recent happenings include the fatal death of a 10-year-old pupil from Arellano University in Malabon named Lyzel Angela Santiago who was playing with the swing when she fell to the ground face down just as the swing's frame cracked open her head&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rp2.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/metro-manila/11/27/08/arellano-university-pupil-dies-playground-accident |title=Arellano University pupil dies in playground accident |publisher=ABS-CBN News |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/136015/10-year-old-pupil-dies-after-fall-from-swing |title=10-year-old pupil dies after fall from swing |publisher=GMA News Online |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a nursing student named Katrina Bautista from Arellano University in Pasig when she drowned during their immersion at Ilog Bulo, [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel]], [[Bulacan]]. Ever since, some parents questioned the safety of the university.

Students also questioned the claim of the University that it gives scholarship to students applying at the School of Law with grade average of 85 and above&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arellanolaw.edu/admis.html#discount |title=Admissions |publisher=Arellano University School of Law |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; because when a student would apply for the said [[scholarship]], the faculty evades the issue. Some even citing it is a [[propaganda]] to attract enrollment.

The celebration for the [[World Intellectual Property Day]] for 2010 on the [[Philippines]] was held at the university, with Hon. Harry K. Thomas, Jr. delivering the welcome message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arellano.edu.ph/news.php?article_id=285&amp;page= |title=World Intellectual Property Day held in AU |publisher=Arellano University |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==

[[File:Arellano University Rizal Hall.jpg|thumb|left|The Rizal Hall.]]

The campus lies on an area in [[Manila]] known as the [[University Belt]], the unofficial name of a [[de facto]] sub-district of Manila, and is bounded by Legarda St. to the north and C.M. Aguila St. on the south. Colegio de Santa Catalina lies on the east while an ABE International Business College campus sits on the west. The university transferred into its present location immediately after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name= &quot;AUHistory&quot;/&gt; The first structures in the campus were the Rizal Hall, followed by the Florentino Cayco, Sr. Memorial Hall and the Plaridel Hall. Other structures in the campus were the Paulino F. Cayco Hall and the Socio-civic Center, the gymnasium of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arellano.edu.ph/facilities.php?article_id=13 |title=Gymnasium |publisher=Arellano University |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main campus has several residential buildings, as well as the other campuses. The campus contains one sub-campus, the Arellano University Institute of Arts and Sciences.

To date, the university has established seven campuses&lt;ref name= &quot;AUHistory&quot;/&gt; and several extension branches within [[Metro Manila|the Metropolis]].

==Administration and organization==
Arellano University School of Law administration is a big liar on its claim on its official website that it gives scholarship to students with grade average of 85 and above. This is never true. When deserving students would inquire about this, the school office staffs would evade the issue. This program does not exist. This is a cunning propaganda of the school administration to attract new enrollees. Prospective enrollees may check this to current law students of the school. A faculty of approximately 200 professors, lecturers, and instructors serve the university. The university is governed by a Board of Trustees. The [[President of Arellano University]] is the day-to-day administrator of the university, along with the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name=&quot;AU Admin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arellano.edu.ph/administration.php?catcat_id=7 |title=About the CEO |publisher=Arellano University |accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All campuses of Arellano University are under their supervision,&lt;ref name=&quot;AU Admin&quot; /&gt; while each campus are under their own administrative heads. Being the flagship campus, the university was the seat of administration and was the second oldest constituent university of Arellano University.
