The '''Our Lady of the Holy Rosary School''' (OLHRS), also known as ''Holy Rosary - La Salle'', is a school offering preschool, elementary and high school education under the Lasallian Schools Supervision Office (LASSO) of the De La Salle University - Manila.

==History==
OLHRS started operations in 1993 with only 2 rooms. To be able to continuously nourish the minds of the children in Tanza, Cavite, school head Maxima Hernandez obtained a loan from Bangko Mabuhay to put up a two-storey building for its elementary classes in Deborahville, Brgy. Amaya I. Inspired by the success and the many students it has graduated, OLHRS acquired a 1-hectare property at Mulawin, Tanza for its high school classes.
