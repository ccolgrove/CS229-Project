{{main|Eelam War IV}}
The '''Northern Theater of Eelam War IV''' refers to the fighting that took place in the northern province of Sri Lanka between July 2006 and May 18, 2009.

==Beginning of the war==
{{Sri Lankan Conflict}}
A new crisis leading to the first large-scale fighting since signing of the ceasefire occurred when the LTTE closed the [[sluice gate]]s of the [[Mavil Aru]] (Mavil Oya)  on July 21 and cut the [[water supply]] to 15,000 villages in government controlled areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc12&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5249884.stm | title = Sri Lanka forces attack reservoir|work =|publisher = BBC News|date=August 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial negotiations by the SLMM to open the gates failed, the Air Force attacked LTTE positions on July 26, and ground troops began an operation to open the gates.&lt;ref name=&quot;dm1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymirror.lk/2006/07/27/front/6.asp | title = Air Force jets hit LTTE targets|work =Sunil Jayasiri|publisher = The Daily Mirror| date =July 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these moves, the political leader of the LTTE [[S Elilan]] announced an end to the cease-fire although [[Palitha Kohona]], a government spokesman, stated that the government remained committed to the cease-fire.

The sluice gates were eventually reopened on August 8, with conflicting reports as to who actually opened them. Initially, the SLMM claimed that they managed to persuade the LTTE to lift the waterway blockade conditionally.&lt;ref name=&quot;fline1&quot;&gt;slmm attempt&lt;/ref&gt; However a government spokesman said that &quot;utilities can not be used as bargaining tools&quot; by the rebels&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc12&quot;/&gt; and the government forces launched fresh attacks on LTTE positions around the reservoir. These attacks prompted condemnation from SLMM Chief of Staff, who stated &quot;(The government does) have the information that the LTTE has made this offer,&quot;... &quot;It is quite obvious they are not interested in water. They are interested in something else.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc12&quot; /&gt; As the battle warmed up, the LTTE claimed that they opened the sluice gates &quot;on humanitarian grounds&quot; although this was disputed by military correspondents, who stated that the water began flowing immediately after the security forces carried out a precise bombing of the Mavil Oya anicut.&lt;ref name=&quot;st2&quot;&gt;''The Sunday Times Situation Report'', [http://sundaytimes.lk/060813/index.html Eelam war IV rages on several fronts]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, following heavy fighting with the rebels, government troops gained full control of the Mavil Oya reservoir on August 15.&lt;ref name=&quot;jw1&quot;&gt;''Iqbal Athas, Janes Defence Weekly,'' [http://www.janes.com/defence/news/jdw/jdw060817_1_n.shtml Full-scale fighting flares in Sri Lanka]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Muhamalai FDL===
{{main|Battle of the Forward Defence Lines}}
Meanwhile, in the north of the country, some of the bloodiest fighting since 2001 took place after the LTTE launched massive attacks on the [[Sri Lanka Army]] defence lines in the Jaffna peninsula on August 11. The LTTE used a force of 400 to 500 fighters in the attacks which consisted of land and amphibious assaults, and also fired a barrage of artillery at government positions, including the key military airbase at [[Palaly]] (PaluyÄla).&lt;ref name=&quot;hindu3&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200608121801.htm | title = At least 127 combatants killed in Lanka fighting: military |work =|publisher = The Hindu| date =August 12, 2006 | location=Chennai, India}} {{Dead link|date=December 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Tigers broke through army defense lines around Muhamalai, and advanced further north,&lt;ref name=&quot;oi1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.oneindia.in/2006/08/12/sri-lanka-rebels-say-destroy-northern-defences-advance-1155353635.html | title = Lanka rebels destroy northern defenses, advance |work =|publisher = One India| date =August 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were halted after 10 hours of fierce fighting.

==War in Mannar front==
===Battle of Silavathurai  ===

The SL army had announced a major operation to oust separatists from the region, and on 2-September 2007 it announced the capture of the Sea Tiger base in Silvaturai&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2007/9/18933.html | title = Military says it captured rebel territory in north  |work =|publisher = LankaNewspapers.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrippu areas. The military began the offensive aimed at seizing control of areas south of Mannar, saying rebels were holding some 6,000 civilians who want to escape LTTE conscription.
The SL army Commander, Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka claimed it as a significant victory for the military as the LTTE used the base to smuggle in arms and ammunition from Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6974860.stm|title=Sri Lanka army 'takes rebel base'|publisher=BBC News|date=2 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/013189552b7697d5052e0a7844359d73.htm|title=SRI LANKA: More displaced as fighting flares up in northwest|publisher=Reuters|date=12 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Madhu===
Battle has taken place around the sacred ''Madhu Shrine'' which is the most revered [[Roman Catholic]] shrine in Sri Lanka. The Bishop of Mannar, Rayappu Joseph removed the sacred statue of [[Virgin Mary]] from the church for the first time in 400 years. The statue was taken into [[LTTE]] control area by The Bishop of Mannar.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7329452.stm|title=Revered Sri Lankan statue removed|publisher=BBC News|date=4 April 2008|first=Roland|last=Buerk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mannar]] Bishop Rayappu Joseph appealed both sides to respect the area as a no-war zone. He further said that the LTTE had set up positions in front of the sacred shrine.&lt;ref name=BBC1/&gt;
