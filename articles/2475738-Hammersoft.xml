==Biography==
===Education===
Gus Johnson attended the [[University of Detroit Jesuit High School and Academy]]. He graduated in 1985. That same year, according to the winter 1997 edition of University of Detroit Jesuit's alumni magazine, ''Highlights'', Johnson was all-league quarterback for the school's football team, an all-league shooting guard on the basketball team, and first baseman and catcher on the baseball team. The 1984-1985 University of Detroit Jesuit yearbook also notes that Johnson was a co-captain of both the football and basketball teams and most valuable player on the latter.
Johnson subsequently graduated from [[Howard University]] with a degree in political science in 1990 and was a four-year letter winner on Howard's baseball team.

===Early career===
Johnson called play-by-play for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] (1996&amp;ndash;97), [[Big East Conference|Big East]] Basketball on the Big East Network, [[college hockey]] and [[college basketball]] on ESPN, and [[Canadian Football League]] games for [[ESPN2]].  He also does some NFL games for CBS.

Johnson hosted [[ESPN]]'s ''Black College Sports Today'' in 1991. After brief stints as an on-air personality with [[KXXV-TV]] in Waco, Texas, [[WAAY-TV]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], and [[WXII-TV]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], he served as the weekend anchor for [[WTTG-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], from 1991 to 1992. Gus also had a small [[Cameo appearance|cameo]], as an announcer, in the 1998 film ''[[He Got Game]]''.

===Style===
Johnson is known primarily for his enthusiasm and excitement that he shares with the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patashnik|first=Josh|title=The Golden Gus|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/the-golden-gus|publisher=The New Republic|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His style incites viewers to watch regardless of interest to either team.   He often uses signature phrases &quot;Oh my goodness!&quot;, &quot;Rise and fire... Count it!&quot;, &quot;From the parking lot!&quot;, &quot;And the Runner....Bang&quot;,&quot;Pure!&quot;, &quot;BAM!&quot;, &quot;Cold-Blooded!&quot;, and &quot;HA-HAAA&quot;.  ESPN's Bill Simmons frequently cites Johnson to be the &quot;cause&quot; of the many exciting finishes to the games he calls, calling it &quot;the Law of Gus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simmons|first=Bill|title=Sports Guy's Week 10 picks (5 November 2010)|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmonsnfl2010/week10picks&amp;sportCat=nfl|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roles===
Johnson called numerous sports for [[CBS Sports]], with his most recognized role as a play-by-play announcer for CBS' [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]], which he  worked each year from 1996 to 2011. Johnson is particularly known for his calls at the end of several close NCAA Tournament games including the double-overtime Xavier vs Kansas State game on March 25, 2010.
Johnson worked for the [[Madison Square Garden Network]] (MSG) from 1994â2010, where he was the radio play-by-play and backup television play-by-play announcer of the [[NBA]]'s [[New York Knicks]], in addition to providing television play-by-play for MSG's coverage of the [[WNBA]]'s [[New York Liberty]]. With the Knicks, he was well known for some of his calls.  For example, one famous Gus line occurs after Knicks forward Al Harrington scores: &quot;My name is Al Harrington... And I get Buckets!&quot;  Perhaps Johnson's most famous Knicks call was his yelling and screaming during [[Allan Houston]]'s last second shot to knock off the top-seeded [[Miami Heat]] in the first round of the 1999 playoffs, en route to an unlikely NBA Finals appearance.  Johnson has also provided commentary for MSG's coverage of the [[Golden Gloves|Golden Gloves Tournament]] and served as host of the &quot;Yankees ScoreCard&quot; and &quot;SportsDesk&quot;, as well as the [[New York Rangers]] and Knicks &quot;GameNight.&quot; Beginning in 2006, Johnson served as the pre-season TV voice for the [[Buffalo Bills]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Johnson also provided play-by-play commentary for the [[Arena Football League (1987â2008)|Arena Football League's]] defunct [[New York Dragons]].

In 2008, Johnson handled play-by-play duties for [[2008 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] pre-season games on [[The Detroit Lions Television Network]]. 

Johnson became lead blow-by-blow caller for ''[[Showtime Championship Boxing]]'' on CBS-owned [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], replacing longtime voice [[Steve Albert]]. Johnson is also a sports announcer for [[Strikeforce]] mixed martial arts alongside [[Mauro Ranallo]].  Johnson was widely derided for his commentary during the Kimbo Slice vs Seth Petruzelli fight, where he announced that the fight was &quot;The most incredible victory in the history of mixed martial arts&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;sports.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;http://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news?slug=dw-petruzelli100708&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fightline.com&quot;&gt;http://www.fightline.com/fl/news/2011/0819/543179/&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson was also the play-by-play man alongside [[Bill Raftery]] in EA Sports ''[[NCAA Basketball 10]]''.

In May 2010, it was announced that Johnson will be the play-by-play announcer in EA Sports ''[[Madden NFL 11]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5543678/madden-taps-gus-johnson-for-video-games-top-play+by+play-job]&lt;/ref&gt;He is also the play-by-play announcer in ''[[Madden NFL 12]]''.

Johnson is also the play-by-play announcer for the fictional football games seen in commercials for [[Buffalo Wild Wings]], in which games are rigged and sent into overtime to allow patrons to stay longer and enjoy the experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnbc.com&quot;&gt;http://www.cnbc.com/id/42154986/Gus_Johnson_Trademarks_Rise_Fire_To_Sell_Apparel&lt;/ref&gt; 

Johnson has also been an announcer for the [[Big Ten Network]]'s Sunday Night basketball games since the 2008-2009 season,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/chi-081026-gus-johnson-big-ten-network,0,3204733.story Chicago Tribune August 26, 2008 Big Ten adds Johnson to its network lineup]&lt;/ref&gt; and is slated to announce 23 games for the network in the 2010-2011 season. 

Before the [[2010â11 NBA season]], it was announced that Gus Johnson was let go by [[MSG Network]], the television flagship station for the [[New York Knicks]].

CBS released Johnson on May 5, 2011 following a contract dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/richard_deitsch/05/05/gusjohnson.cbs/ | work=CNN | title=Gus Johnson parts ways with CBS | date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was still scheduled to call a boxing match between [[Shane Mosley]] and [[Manny Pacquiao]] for Showtime two days later. On May 9, 2011, Johnson finalized a deal to call college football and NFL telecasts for [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/college/2011/05/09/2011-05-09_gus_johnson_officially_out_at_cbs_headed_to_fox_after_cbs_declines_to_match_foxs.html#ixzz1Lu5PIQou | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Gus Johnson officially out at CBS, headed to Fox after CBS declines to match Fox's offer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
