It contains music from the series, composed by [[Hideki Taniuchi]] and [[Yoshihisa Hirano]]. It also features the new opening and closing themes by [[Maximum the Hormone]] in the TV size format.

Strangely, track 5 is identical to the first OST's track 28, although they have different titles. The first press' slipcover featured glow-in-the-dark artwork.

&lt;!-- These are the English translations of the songs, so leave them as Misa's Song, not Misa no Uta. --&gt; 
&lt;!-- Still, the original tracktitles are &quot;Misa no Uta&quot; and so on. No Kanji or Kana, though. Just look into the booklet of the CD. So I'm writing the original tracktitles in parentheses and italic, with that, everybody is at least able to see the titles as they're meant to be.--&gt;
