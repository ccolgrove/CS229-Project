&quot;'''Just Like Strange Rain'''&quot; is a song by [[Elton John]] with lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]]. It was originally released as the B-side to his third single, &quot;[[It's Me That You Need]]&quot;. It appeared as the last bonus track on the 1995 reissue of his first album ''[[Empty Sky]]''.

==Musical structure==
The song opens with a loud electric guitar before segueing into the main verse. It is a steady R&amp;B-beat accompanied by both [[hammond organ]] and [[piano]]. The song ends with the title being shouted several times over a [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] guitar solo. However, there is a certain &quot;[[hymn]]&quot;-feel over the song as with many of John's earliest.

==Lyrical meaning==
Mentioning various colours and being about love it is one of the very few Taupin lyrics that's considered psychedelic. The use of words is very diverse. Words such as &quot;Comic book&quot; and &quot;Embroidered&quot; are very rare to find in the same lyric elsewhere.

It was not performed anywhere at anytime and is not a popular pick among fans.
