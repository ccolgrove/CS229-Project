==Muscle Returns==
Although this story has had some continuity errors removed in recent reprints, it still does not fit in well with Kinnikuman Nisei canon.

----
; Buki Boy (ãã­ãã¼ã¤)
*Classification: [[Zangyaku]] ChÅjin
*Homeland: [[Brazil]] {{flagicon|Brazil}}
*Trademark Techniques: Buki Thunder Hammer Drop, Bewitching Eyelids, Choking Sleeper
*First Appearance: Muscle Returns

A very powerful ChÅjin who bursts onto the scene and easily takes out Warsman, Terryman, and Buffaloman. He is eventually defeated by Kinnikuman.

----
; Kuan (ã¯ã¡ã³)
*Classification: Seigi ChÅjin
*Homeland: [[Akaishi Mountains]], [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], [[Japan]] {{flagicon|Japan}}
*First Appearance: Muscle Returns

A wild boy chÅjin that is friends with Kinnikuman. This character was later reused in [[Ultimate Muscle|Kinnikuman Nisei]], still a child, creating a continuity error.

----
; [[Kevin Mask]]
*Classification: Seigi ChÅjin
*Homeland: [[England]] {{flagicon|United Kingdom}}
*First Appearance: Muscle Returns

The son of Robin Mask and later a major character in m.u.s.c.l.e. and c.h.e.e.s.e. seres of toys [[Ultimate Muscle|Kinnikuman Nisei]]. He appears in the original printing as a child sized duplicate of Robin Mask and refers to Robin as {{nihongo|&quot;Tou-san&quot;|[[wiktionary:ç¶|ç¶ãã]],|father}}, but in the Remix he is changed to look more like he does in Nisei and refers to Robin as &quot;Daddy&quot;. His presence in the story is one of its biggest continuity errors, as the story takes place 8 years after the Survivor Match and his starting age in Nisei (18) implies that he has not even been born yet.
