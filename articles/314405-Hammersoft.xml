'''Yeah Yeah Yeahs''' are an American [[indie rock]] band formed in [[New York City]] in 2000. The group is composed of vocalist and pianist [[Karen O]], guitarist and keyboardist [[Nick Zinner]], and drummer [[Brian Chase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phares |first=Heather |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yeah-yeah-yeahs-p522831/biography |title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs |publisher=AllMusic |date=2002-05-17 |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are complemented in live performances by second guitarist [[David Pajo]], who joined as a touring member in 2009 and replaced [[Imaad Wasif]] who had previously held this role. According to an interview that aired during the ABC network's ''Live from [[Central Park SummerStage]]'' series, the band's name was taken from modern New York City [[vernacular]]. 

The band has recorded three studio albums; the first, ''[[Fever to Tell]]'', was released in 2003. The second, ''[[Show Your Bones]]'', was released in 2006 and was named the second best album of the year by ''[[NME]]''. Their third studio album, ''[[It's Blitz!]]'', was released on 31 March 2009 in the USA and on 6 April 2009 in the rest of the world.

==History==
===Formation (2000â2002)===
[[Karen O]] and [[Brian Chase]] first met as students at [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio in the late '90s, where Chase was a [[jazz]] student at the conservatory. Karen then transferred to [[New York University]], and while in New York met [[Nick Zinner|Zinner]] in a local bar, where they formed an &quot;instant connection&quot;. During this time they also shared a loft in Manhattan with future members of the band [[Metric (band)|Metric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ladygunn.com/music/emily-haines-of-metric-interview |title=YYYs shared a loft with Metric |publisher=Ladygunn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two formed an acoustic duo called &quot;Unitard&quot;, but soon decided to &quot;shake things up a bit&quot; by forming a &quot;trashy, punky, grimy&quot; band modeled after the art student, [[avant-punk]] bands Karen O. was exposed to at Oberlin. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/feb/26/popandrock.yeahyeahyeahs|title=Lynsey Hansley talks to Yeah Yeah Yeahs| first=Lynsey| last=Hanley| date=February 26, 2006| work=[[The Guardian]]| accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the drummer they recruited initially bowed out, Chase joined the line-up.

The band wrote a slew of songs at their first rehearsal and soon wound up supporting [[The Strokes]] and [[The White Stripes]], earning a significant buzz for their arty and garage punk scene. In late 2001, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs (EP)|self-titled debut EP]], which they recorded with [[Boss Hog]]'s Jerry Teel, on their own Shifty label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jerry+Teel| title=Jerry Teel| work=[[Discogs]]|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early the next year the band stepped into the international spotlight, appearing at [[South by Southwest]], touring the U.S. with [[Girls Against Boys]] and Europe with [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]], and headlining their own U.K. tour. [[Wichita Recordings]] distributed the group's EP in the U.K. and [[Touch and Go Records|Touch and Go]] reissued it in the States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/yeah_yeah_yeahs/artist.jhtml| title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs| work=mtv.com| publisher=MTV| accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Fever To Tell'' (2003â2004)===
In 2003, the band released their debut album, ''[[Fever to Tell]]'', which received several strong critical reviews and sold more than 750,000 copies worldwide. The album's third single, &quot;[[Maps (song)|Maps]]&quot;, received significant airplay on [[alternative music|alternative]] radio. In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked &quot;[[Maps (song)|Maps]]&quot; as 386th in their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The video for their 2004 single &quot;[[Y Control]]&quot; was directed by [[Spike Jonze]]. In October 2004, the band released their first [[DVD]], ''[[Tell Me What Rockers to Swallow]]''. The DVD included a [[concert]] filmed at [[The Fillmore]] in [[San Francisco]], all of the band's music videos to date, and various interviews. 

In November 2009, the [[NME]] rated ''Fever to Tell'' the #5 Best Album of the Decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/48412 |title=The Strokes' 'Is This It' tops NME albums of the decade list  |accessdate=2009-11-17  |date=November 17, 2009 |work=NME News |publisher=[[NME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Show Your Bones'' (2005-2006)===
[[Image:Karen O, Tim Festival.jpg|thumb|upright|Karen O live at the Tim Festival in 2006]]
Their second album, ''[[Show Your Bones]]'', was released on 27â28 March 2006. [[Karen O]] told [[online zine]] [[Drowned in Sound]], &quot;''[[Show Your Bones]]'' is what happens when you put your finger in a light socket,&quot; crediting &quot;9 year old antigenius wonder-kid Drake Barrett for the insight.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Colin |last=Roberts  |url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/562122 |title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs LP and single details, yeah |work=[[Drowned In Sound]] |date=January 11, 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first single from the album, &quot;[[Gold Lion]]&quot;, was released on 20 March 2006, reaching number 18 in the [[Official UK Singles Chart]]. It has been noted by Leah Greenblatt that &quot;[[Gold Lion]]&quot; sounds startlingly similar to &quot;No New Tale To Tell&quot; from 1980s alternative band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenblatt |first=Leah |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1204700,00.html |title=Did The Red Hot Chili Peppers copy Tom Petty? |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=June 16, 2006 |issue=883 |accessdate=2008-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band toured throughout [[Europe]] and the [[United States]] during much of 2006, and also helped to curate an edition of the British [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival.

In December 2006, the album was named the second best album of the year by ''[[NME]]'' magazine, as well as &quot;Cheated Hearts&quot; being voted the 10th best song. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named it the 44th best album of 2006, while ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine ranked it number 31 on their 40 best albums of 2006.

===''Is Is'' EP (2007)===
Yeah Yeah Yeahs' third EP, titled ''[[Is Is]]'', was released on 24 July 2007. It includes 5 previously unreleased songs and a short film, which was recorded and filmed at the GlassLands Gallery in Brooklyn, NY. The songs were written in 2004, during the Fever To Tell tour, and performed live often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43606-yeah-yeah-yeahs-to-release-new-ep-of-old-songs|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080307024159/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43606-yeah-yeah-yeahs-to-release-new-ep-of-old-songs|archivedate=2008-03-07|title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs to Release New EP of Old Songs|last=Maher|first=Dave|date=July 13, 2006|work=Pitchfork|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the five tracks were featured on the &quot;[[Tell Me What Rockers to Swallow]]&quot; DVD.

===''It's Blitz!'' (2008â2009)===
The next album by the band was released in March 2009 and is titled ''[[It's Blitz!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/34436-new-yeah-yeah-yeahs-album-iits-blitzi/|title=New Yeah Yeah Yeahs Album: It's Blitz| date=January 21, 2009| work=[[Pitchfork Media]]| author=Breihan, Tom| accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band says the album sounds different from their previous ones but &quot;still [sounds] like Yeah Yeah Yeahs&quot;. The album was originally set to be released 13 April, but following the [[internet leak|leak]] to the Internet on 22 February&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://diditleak.co.uk/?paged=2| title=diditleak.co.uk| accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the band's label, Interscope, pulled the release date closer to reduce the impact of the online leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nme.com/news/yeah-yeah-yeahs/43188| title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs to release album early due to leak| date=March 3, 2009| work=[[NME]] |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album spawned three singles: &quot;[[Zero (Yeah Yeah Yeahs song)|Zero]]&quot;, &quot;[[Heads Will Roll (song)|Heads Will Roll]]&quot; and &quot;[[Skeletons (Yeah Yeah Yeahs song)|Skeletons]]&quot;.
