'''DVD Decrypter''' is a software application for [[Microsoft Windows]] (including [[Windows 7]] support) that can create backup [[disk image]]s of the DVD-Video structure of [[DVD]]s.  It can be used to image any DVD, but controversially it is especially useful for [[decryption|decrypting]] [[copy protection|copy protected]] movies.  The program can also [[CD recorder|record]] images to disc. [[Content Scrambling System]] (CSS) decrypting software (such as DVD Decrypter and [[AnyDVD]]) allows a region-specific DVD to be copied as an all-region DVD. It also removes [[Macrovision#Content Protection|Macrovision content protection]], CSS, [[regional lockout|region codes]], and [[user operation prohibition]].

==Legality in the United States==
As DVD Decrypter facilitates the removal of copy restrictions, certain uses may be illegal under the United States [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] unless making copies which are covered under the [[Fair Use]] doctrine. In countries without similar laws there may not be any legal restrictions.

On June 6, 2005, the developer, Lightning UK!, announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/DVD-Decrypter---Gone-Forever.html |title=Cease and desist letter published at CD Freaks |publisher=Cdfreaks.com |date=April 22, 2006 |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; via the CD Freaks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdfreaks.com |title=CDFreaks.com |publisher=CDFreaks.com |date=April 22, 2006 |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; website that he received a [[cease and desist]] letter from [[Macrovision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slyck.com/story1007.html |title=Slyck News - Macrovision Forces Removal of DVD Decrypter |publisher=Slyck.com |date=November 24, 2005 |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated it was within his best interests to comply with the letter, and stopped development of the program.  By June 7, 2005, a [[Mirror (computing)|mirror]] site was up,&lt;ref name=&quot;dvddmirror&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/ |title=(now at DVDDecrypter.org.uk, aka &quot;The original unofficial DVD Decrypter mirror&quot;) |publisher=DVDDecrypter.co.uk |date=June 7, 2005 |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed people to download the final version (3.5.4.0).  On November 27, 2005, Afterdawn.com, a [[Finland|Finnish]] website, announced that it complied with a letter received from Macrovision demanding that DVD Decrypter be taken down from its site.  Shortly thereafter, an &quot;original unofficial&quot; mirror site with no connection to Lightning UK! reappeared.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvddmirror&quot; /&gt;

Under United States' Federal law, making a backup copy of a [[DVD-Video]] or an [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|audio CD]] by a consumer is legal under [[fair use]] protection. This provision of United States law conflicts with the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] prohibition of so-called &quot;circumvention measures&quot; of [[copy protection]]s.

In the &quot;321&quot; case, Federal District Judge Susan Illston of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdxcopy.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/72527 Judge: DVD-copying software is illegal], afterdawn.com, February 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ruled that the backup copies made with software such as DVD Decrypter are legal but that distribution of the software used to make them is illegal.

In 2010 the [[Librarian of Congress]] instituted a DMCA exemption which protects circumvention of CSS protection under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2010/10-169.html DMCA Rules for Exemptions Regarding Circumvention of Access-Control Technologies], loc.gov, April 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This exemption will expire in 2013. {{Update after|2013}}

The software was still legally available due to many countries not having such restrictions, but in November 2005, Macrovision acquired the intellectual property rights to the software, revoked all licenses of use for the software, and started sending cease-and-desist letters to distributors on the grounds of copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Pyyny, Petteri &quot;dRD&quot;.

On October 4, 2005, Lightning UK! continued the development of the burning engine used by DVD Decrypter in his new tool, [[ImgBurn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imgburn.com/ |title=Official ImgBurn website |publisher=Imgburn.com |date= |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ImgBurn, however, does not have the ability to circumvent copy protections of encrypted DVDs.
