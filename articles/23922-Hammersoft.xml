'''Princeton University ''' is a [[private university|private]] [[research university]] located in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]]. The school is one of the eight universities of the [[Ivy League]], and is one of the nine [[Colonial Colleges]] founded before the [[American Revolution]].

Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural science]]s, and [[engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/about/|title=About Princeton|author=Princeton University, Office of Communications|accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton does not have schools of [[medicine]], [[law]], [[divinity]], or [[business]], but it does offer professional degrees through the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], the School of [[Engineering|Engineering and Applied Sciences]], and the School of [[Architecture]].

Founded in 1746 in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], as the College of New Jersey, the university moved to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in 1747, then to Princeton in 1756 and was renamed Princeton University in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/ph/05/03.htm|title=&quot;Princeton's History&quot; â Parent's Handbook, 2005â06|publisher=Princeton University|month=August | year=2005|accessdate=2006-09-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060904214124/http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/ph/05/03.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The present-day [[The College of New Jersey|College of New Jersey]] in nearby [[Ewing, New Jersey]], is an unrelated institution.)

Princeton was the [[Colonial Colleges|fourth]] institution of [[higher education]] in the U.S. to conduct classes.&lt;ref&gt;Princeton's own phrasing is that it was &quot;the fourth college to be established in British North America.&quot;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/facts/revolution.html|title=Princeton in the American Revolution|author=Princeton University, Office of Communications|accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=founding&gt;Princeton appears to be the fourth institution to ''conduct classes'', based on dates that do not seem to be in dispute. Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania both claim the fourth oldest founding date; the University of Pennsylvania once used 1749 as its founding date, making it fifth, but in 1899, its trustees adopted a resolution that asserted 1740 as the founding date. For the details of Penn's claim, see [[University of Pennsylvania]]; and [http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0902/thomas.html âBuilding Penn's Brandâ] for background, and [http://www.princeton.edu/mudd/news/faq/topics/older.shtml âPrinceton vs. Penn: Which is the Older Institution?â] for Princeton's view. A [[Log College]] was operated by [[William Tennent|William]] and [[Gilbert Tennent]], the Presbyterian ministers, in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]], from 1726 until 1746; it was once common to assert a connection between it and the College of New Jersey, which would justify Princeton pushing its founding date back to 1726. Princeton, however, has never done so and a Princeton historian says that the facts âdo not warrantâ such an interpretation. [http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/log_college.html]. [[Columbia University]] and [[Rutgers]] began classes in 1754 and 1766; their continuity was severely shaken during the [[American Revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt; While it once had close ties to the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]], it has never been affiliated with any denomination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/facts/revolution.html|title=Princeton in the American Revolution|author=Princeton University Office of Communications|accessdate=2011-05-24}} The original [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]] &quot;were acting in behalf of the evangelical or New Light wing of the Presbyterian Church, but the College had no legal or constitutional identification with that denomination. Its doors were to be open to all students, 'any different sentiments in religion notwithstanding.'&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and today imposes no [[Religion|religious]] requirements on its students.&lt;ref&gt;Compulsory chapel attendance was reduced from twice a day in 1882 and abolished in 1964: http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/05/Companion/university_chapel.html?15#mfs&lt;/ref&gt; The university has ties with the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], and the [[Westminster Choir College]] of [[Rider University]].&lt;ref&gt;Princeton Theological Seminary and Westminster Choir College maintain [[cross-registration]] programs with the university.&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton has been associated with 35 [[Nobel Laureates]], 17 [[National Medal of Science]] winners, and three National Humanities Medal winners. On a per-student basis, Princeton has the largest university endowment in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11|title=Colleges with the Biggest Endowments Per Student|author=CNBC|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Princeton University}}
[[Image:Rhind sculpture at Princeton.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Sculpture by [[J. Massey Rhind]] (1892), Alexander Hall, Princeton University]]
[[The Old Side-New Side Controversy|New Light]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] founded the '''College of New Jersey''', later Princeton University, in 1746 in order to train ministers dedicated to their views. The college was the educational and religious capital of Scotch-Irish America.  In 1756, the college moved to Princeton, New Jersey. Its home in Princeton was [[Nassau Hall]], named for the royal [[House of Orange-Nassau|house]] of [[William III of England]].

Following the untimely deaths of Princeton's first five [[President of Princeton University|presidents]], [[John Witherspoon]] became President in 1768 and remained in that office until his death in 1794. During his presidency, Witherspoon shifted the college's focus from training ministers to preparing a new generation for leadership in the new American nation. To this end, he tightened academic standards and solicited investment in the college.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffry H. Morrison, ''John Witherspoon and the Founding of the American Republic'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Witherspoon's presidency constituted a long period of stability for the college, interrupted by the [[American Revolution]] and particularly the [[Battle of Princeton]], during which British soldiers briefly occupied Nassau Hall; American forces, led by [[George Washington]], fired [[cannon]] on the building to rout them from it.

Before the construction of Stanhope Hall in 1803, Nassau Hall was the college's sole building. During the summer of 1783, the [[Continental Congress]] met in Nassau Hall, making Princeton the country's capital for four months. Over the centuries and through two redesigns following major fires, Nassau Hall's role shifted from an all-purpose building, comprising office, dormitory, library, and classroom space; to classroom space exclusively; to its present role as the administrative center of the University. The class of 1879 donated twin [[lion]] sculptures that flanked the entrance until 1911, when that same class replaced them with [[tiger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/nassau_hall.html Princeton Companion]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James McCosh]] took office as the college's president in 1868 and lifted the institution out of a low period that had been brought about by the [[American Civil War]]. During his two decades of service, he overhauled the curriculum, oversaw an expansion of inquiry into the sciences, and supervised the addition of a number of buildings in the [[Gothic revival|High Victorian Gothic]] style to the campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etc.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/mccosh_james.html Princeton Companion]&lt;/ref&gt; McCosh Hall is named in his honor.

In 1896, the college officially changed its name from the College of New Jersey to Princeton University to honor the town in which it resides. During this year, the college also underwent large expansion and officially became a university. Under [[Woodrow Wilson]], Princeton introduced the preceptorial system in 1905, a then-unique concept that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, in their field of interest.

In 1969, Princeton University first admitted women as undergraduates. In 1887, the university had actually maintained and staffed a [[sister college]], [[Evelyn College for Women]], in the town of Princeton on Evelyn and Nassau streets. It was closed after roughly a decade of operation. After abortive discussions with [[Sarah Lawrence College]] to relocate the women's college to Princeton and merge it with the University in 1967, the administration decided to admit women and turned to the issue of transforming the school's operations and facilities into a female-friendly campus. The administration had barely finished these plans in April 1969 when the admissions office began mailing out its acceptance letters. Its five-year coeducation plan provided $7.8 million for the development of new facilities that would eventually house and educate 650 women students at Princeton by 1974. Ultimately, 148 women, consisting of 100 freshmen and transfer students of other years, entered Princeton on September 6, 1969 amidst much media attention. (Princeton enrolled its first female graduate student, Sabra Follett Meserve, as a Ph.D. candidate in Turkish history in 1961. A handful of undergraduate women had studied at Princeton from 1963 on, spending their junior year there to study &quot;critical languages&quot; in which Princeton's offerings surpassed those of their home institutions. They were considered regular students for their year on campus, but were not candidates for a Princeton degree.)

As a result of a 1979 lawsuit by [[Sally Frank]], [[Eating club (Princeton University)|Princeton's eating clubs]] were required to go coeducational in 1991, after [[Tiger Inn]]'s appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;Princeton Eating Club Loses Bid to Continue Ban on Women,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'', 23 January 1991, p. A4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus sits on about {{convert|500|acre|km2}} split between two municipalities, the [[Borough of Princeton, New Jersey|Borough of Princeton]] and [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton Township]]. The James Forrestal Campus is split between nearby [[Plainsboro Township, New Jersey|Plainsboro]] and [[South Brunswick, New Jersey|South Brunswick]].

A group of 20th-century sculptures scattered throughout the campus forms the Putnam Collection of Sculpture. It includes works by  [[Alexander Calder]] (''Five Disks: One Empty''), [[Jacob Epstein]] (''Albert Einstein''), [[Henry Moore]] (''Oval With Points''), [[Isamu Noguchi]] (''White Sun''), and [[Pablo Picasso]] (''Head of a Woman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/putnam_collection_sculpture.html |author=Alexander Leitch |title=A Princeton Companion: Putnam Collection of Sculpture |accessdate=2 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Serra]]'s ''[[The Hedgehog and the Fox (sculpture)|The Hedgehog and The Fox]]'' is located between Peyton and Fine halls next to Princeton Stadium and the Lewis Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Megan|title=Princeton sculpture enriches beauty and character of campus|url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S30/81/71I92/index.xml?section=featured|work=Princeton University website|accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the southern edge of the campus is [[Lake Carnegie (New Jersey)|Lake Carnegie]], a man-made lake named for [[Andrew Carnegie]].

===Cannon Green===
Buried in the ground at the center of the lawn south of Nassau Hall is the &quot;Big Cannon,&quot; which was left in Princeton by British troops as they fled following the [[Battle of Princeton]]. It remained in Princeton until the [[War of 1812]], when it was brought to [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=1 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. |location=Philadelphia |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836 the cannon was returned to Princeton and placed at the eastern end of town. It was removed to the campus under cover of night by Princeton students in 1838 and buried in its current location in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. |location=Philadelphia |pages=317â8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second &quot;Little Cannon&quot; is buried in the lawn in front of nearby [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society|Whig Hall]]. This cannon, which may also have been captured in the Battle of Princeton, was stolen by students of [[Rutgers University]] in 1875. The theft ignited the [[Rutgers-Princeton Cannon War]]. A compromise between the presidents of Princeton and Rutgers ended the War and forced the return of the Little Cannon to Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Frelinghuysen Hageman |title=History of Princeton and Its Institutions |volume=2 |year=1879 |edition=2nd |publisher=J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. |location=Philadelphia |pages=318â9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protruding cannons are occasionally painted scarlet by Rutgers students who continue the traditional dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2006/10/05/16072/ |author=Kate Carroll |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |date=5 Oct 2006 |accessdate=2 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scarletknights.com/tradition/tradition.asp |title=Rutgers Athletics Tradition |publisher=Rutgers University Scarlet Knights |accessdate=2 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In years when the Princeton football team beats the teams of both [[Harvard University]] and [[Yale University]] in the same season, Princeton celebrates with a bonfire on Cannon Green. This occurred most recently in 2006, ending a twelve-year drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2006/11/20/16662/ |title='Not for ourselves, but for the entire Princeton community' |author=Sam Fox Krauss |date=20 Nov 2006 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings===
====Nassau Hall====
{{main|Nassau Hall}}

====Residential colleges====
Princeton has six undergraduate [[residential college]]s, each housing approximately 500 freshmen, sophomores, some juniors and seniors, and a handful of junior and senior [[Resident assistant|resident advisers]]. Each college consists of a set of dormitories, a dining hall, a variety of other amenitiesâsuch as study spaces, libraries, performance spaces, and darkroomsâand a collection of administrators and associated faculty. Two colleges, [[Wilson College, Princeton University|Wilson College]] and [[Forbes College, Princeton University|Forbes College]] (formerly Princeton Inn College), date to the 1970s; three others, [[Rockefeller College|Rockefeller]], [[Mathey College|Mathey]], and [[Butler College|Butler]] Colleges, were created in 1983 following the Committee on Undergraduate Residential Life (CURL) report, which suggested the institution of residential colleges as a solution to an allegedly fragmented campus social life. The construction of [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]], the university's sixth residential college, was completed in 2007.

Rockefeller and Mathey are located in the northwest corner of the campus; Princeton brochures often feature their Collegiate Gothic architecture. Like most of Princeton's Gothic buildings, they predate the residential college system and were fashioned into colleges from individual dormitories.

Wilson and Butler, located south of the center of the campus, were built in the 1960s. Wilson served as an early experiment in the establishment of the residential college system. Butler, like Rockefeller and Mathey, consisted of a collection of ordinary dorms (called the &quot;New New Quad&quot;) before the addition of a dining hall made it a residential college. Widely disliked for their edgy modernist design, the dormitories on the Butler Quad were demolished in 2007. Butler is now reopened as a four year residential college, housing both [[Student#Post-second year|under- and upperclassmen]].

Forbes is located on the site of the historic Princeton Inn, a gracious hotel overlooking the Princeton golf course. The Princeton Inn, originally constructed in 1924, played regular host to important symposia and gatherings of renowned scholars from both the university and the nearby [[Institute for Advanced Study]] for many years.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://etc.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/west_andrew.html Andrew Fleming West]&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes currently houses over 400 undergraduates and a number of resident graduate students in its residential halls. Butler and most of Forbes are in a different [[municipality]], Princeton Township, from the rest of the main campus, which is in [[Borough of Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton Borough]].

In 2003, Princeton broke ground for a sixth college named [[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]] after its principal sponsor, [[Meg Whitman]], who graduated from Princeton in 1977. The new dormitories were constructed in the [[Collegiate Gothic]] architectural style and were designed by architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]]. Construction finished in 2007, and Whitman College was inaugurated as Princeton's sixth residential college that same year.

The precursor of the present college system in America was originally proposed by university president Woodrow Wilson in the early 20th century. For over 800 years, however, the collegiate system had already existed in Britain at Oxford University and Cambridge University. Wilson's model was much closer to [[Yale University|Yale]]'s present system, which features four-year colleges. Lacking the support of the [[Trustees of Princeton University|trustees]], the plan languished until 1968. That year, Wilson College was established to cap a series of alternatives to the eating clubs. Fierce debates raged before the present residential college system emerged. The plan was first attempted at Yale, but the administration was initially uninterested; an exasperated alum, [[Edward Harkness]], finally paid to have the college system implemented at [[Harvard]] in the 1920s, leading to the oft-quoted aphorism that the college system is a Princeton idea that was executed at Harvard with funding from Yale.

Princeton has one graduate residential college, known simply as the Graduate College, located beyond Forbes College at the outskirts of campus. The far-flung location of the G.C. was the spoil of a squabble between Woodrow Wilson and then-Graduate School Dean [[Andrew Fleming West]]. Wilson preferred a central location for the College; West wanted the graduate students as far as possible from the campus. Ultimately, West prevailed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;  The Graduate College is composed of a large [[Collegiate Gothic]] section crowned by [[Cleveland Tower]], a local landmark that also houses a world-class [[carillon]]. The attached New Graduate College departs in its design from Collegiate Gothic; it is reminiscent of the former dormitories of Butler College, the newest of the five pre-Whitman residential colleges.

Today, the Triangle Club performs its annual freshmen revue and spring musicals in McCarter. McCarter is also recognized as one of the leading regional theaters in the [[United States]].

====Art Museum====
{{main|Princeton University Art Museum}}
The [[Princeton University Art Museum]] was established in 1882 to give students direct, intimate, and sustained access to original works of art that complement and enrich instruction and research at the university. This continues to be a primary function, along with serving as a community resource and a destination for national and international visitors.

Numbering over 72,000 objects, the collections range from ancient to contemporary art and concentrate geographically on the [[Mediterranean]] regions, [[Western Europe]], [[China]], the United States, and [[Latin America]]. There is a collection of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|antiquities]], including [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]], marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from faculty excavations in [[Antioch]]. [[Medieval]] Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early [[Renaissance]] through the 19th century, with masterpieces by Monet, CÃ©zanne, and Van Gogh, and features a growing collection of 20th-century and contemporary art, including iconic paintings such as Andy Warhol's Blue Marilyn.

One of the best features of the museums is its collection of Chinese art, with important holdings in bronzes, tomb figurines, painting, and [[calligraphy]]. Its collection of [[pre-Columbian]] art includes examples of Mayan art, and is commonly considered to be the most important collection of Pre-Columbian art outside of Latin America. The museum has collections of old master prints and drawings and a comprehensive collection of over 27,000 original photographs. African art and Northwest Coast Indian art are also represented. The Museum also oversees the outdoor Putnam Collection of Sculpture.

====University Chapel====
{{main|Princeton University Chapel}}
[[Image:Princeton University Chapel 2003.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Princeton University Chapel]]
The [[Princeton University Chapel]] is located on the north side of campus, near Nassau Street. It was built between 1924 and 1928, at a cost of US$2.3 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_univchapel.html |first=Sara |last=Bush |title=The University Chapel |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=6 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately US${{inflation|US|2.3|1928|r=1}} million in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars. Ralph Adams Cram, the University's supervising architect, designed the Chapel, which he viewed as the crown jewel for the Collegiate Gothic motif he had championed for the campus.&lt;ref name=milliner-pip /&gt; At the time of its construction, it was the second largest university chapel in the world, after [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,881074,00.html |title=Religion: Princeton's chapel |magazine=TIME |date=11 Jun 1928 |accessdate=6 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It underwent a two-year, US$10 million restoration campaign between 2000 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.princeton.edu/paw/archive_new/PAW01-02/11-0313/features1.html |first=Kathryn Federici |last=Greenwood |title=Features: Chapel gets facelift and a new dean |magazine=Princeton Alumni Weekly |date=13 Mar 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Trustees of Princeton University, a 40-member board, is responsible for the overall direction of the University. It approves the operating and capital budgets, supervises the investment of the University's endowment and oversees campus real estate and long-range physical planning. The trustees also exercise prior review and approval concerning changes in major policies, such as those in instructional programs and admission, as well as tuition and fees and the hiring of faculty members.

With an endowment of US$17.1 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]], Princeton University is among the wealthiest universities in the world. Ranked in 2010 as the [[List of US colleges and universities by endowment|third]] largest endowment in the United States, the university has the greatest per-student endowment in the world (over US$2 [[million]] for undergraduates).&lt;ref name=&quot;CNBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Colleges with the Biggest Endowment Per Student | year=2011 | work=CNBC | url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/41834274/Colleges_with_the_Biggest_Endowment_Per_Student?slide=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a significant endowment is sustained through the continued donations of its alumni and is maintained by investment advisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Endowment Climbs Past $13 Billion | year=2006 | work=The Daily Princetonian | url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2006/10/27/news/16400.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Princeton's wealth is invested in its art museum, which features works by [[Claude Monet]],  [[Vincent van Gogh]],  [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Andy Warhol]] among other prominent artists.

==Academics==
[[Image:PrincetonCourtyard.jpg|thumb|200px|The courtyard of East Pyne]]
Undergraduates fulfill general education requirements, choose among a wide variety of elective courses, and pursue departmental concentrations and interdisciplinary certificate programs. Required independent work is a hallmark of undergraduate education at Princeton. Students graduate with either the [[Bachelor of Arts]] (A.B.) or the [[Bachelor of Science]] in engineering (B.S.E.).

The [[graduate school]] offers advanced degrees spanning the [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], and [[engineering]]. Doctoral education is available in all disciplines.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} It emphasizes original and independent scholarship whereas master's degree programs in [[architecture]], [[engineering]], [[finance]], and public affairs and public policy prepare candidates for careers in public life and professional practice.

===Undergraduate===
Undergraduate courses in the humanities are traditionally either seminars or lectures held 2 or 3 times a week with an additional discussion seminar that is called a &quot;precept.&quot; To graduate, all A.B. candidates must complete a senior thesis and, in most departments, one or two extensive pieces of independent research that are known as &quot;junior papers.&quot; Juniors in some departments, including architecture and the creative arts, complete independent projects that differ from written research papers. A.B. candidates must also fulfill a three or four semester foreign language requirement and distribution requirements with a total of 31 classes. B.S.E. candidates follow a parallel track with an emphasis on a rigorous science and math curriculum, a computer science requirement, and at least two semesters of independent research including an optional senior thesis. All B.S.E. students must complete at least 36 classes. A.B. candidates typically have more freedom in course selection than B.S.E. candidates because of the fewer number of required classes. Nonetheless, in the spirit of a [[liberal arts]] education, both enjoy a comparatively high degree of latitude in creating a self-structured curriculum.

Undergraduates agree to adhere to an academic integrity policy called the Honor Code, established in 1893. Under the Honor Code, faculty do not proctor examinations; instead, the students proctor one another and must report any suspected violation to an Honor Committee made up of undergraduates. The Committee investigates reported violations and holds a hearing if it is warranted. An acquittal at such a hearing results in the destruction of all records of the hearing; a conviction results in the student's suspension or expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/honor/about_us/ |title=About Us |publisher=Princeton University Honor Committee |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signed pledge required by the Honor Code is so integral to students' academic experience that the [[Princeton Triangle Club|Triangle Club]] performs a song about it each fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/honor_code/ |title=Honor Code |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vNf_W6wE68&lt;/ref&gt; Out-of-class exercises fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/odus/standards/discipline/ |title=Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline |publisher=Princeton University Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduates are expected to sign a pledge on their written work affirming that they have not [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/pub/integrity/08/sources/ |title=Acknowledging Your Sources |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Admissions and financial aid====
Princeton's undergraduate program is highly selective, admitting 8.39% of undergraduate applicants in the 2010-11 admissions cycle (for the Class of 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S30/15/00I77/index.xml |title=Princeton makes offers to 8.39 percent of applicants in record admission cycle |author=Emily Aronson |publisher=Princeton University |date=30 Mar 2011 |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, the university announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 would be considered in a single pool. In this way, the [[early decision]] program was effectively ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/86/07G08/ |title=Princeton to end early admission |author=Princeton University |date=18 Sep 2006 |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, following decisions by the [[University of Virginia]] and [[Harvard University]] to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute an [[early action]] program, starting with applicants for the Class of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S29/85/15K32/index.xml |title=Princeton to reinstate early admission program |author=Princeton University |date=24 Feb 2011 |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, expanding on earlier reforms, Princeton became the first university to eliminate [[Student loan|loans]] for all students who qualify for [[financial aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/CollegeAndFamily/CutCollegeCosts/TheBestValuesInPrivateColleges.aspx |author=Jane Bennett Clark |date=9 Nov 2010 |publisher=MSN Money |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All demonstrated need is met with combinations of grants and campus jobs. In addition, all admissions are [[Need-blind admission|need-blind]].&lt;ref name=princeton-in-brief&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/pr/admissions/u/brief/faq/ |title=Princeton in Brief |author=Princeton University Office of Undergraduate Admissions}} |accessdate=1 Jun 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' and [[Princeton Review]] both cite Princeton as the university that has the fewest of graduates with debt even though 60% of incoming students are on some type of [[financial aid (educational expenses)|financial aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/lst_natudoc_brief.php|title=America's Best Colleges 2008: Least Debt: National Universities|publisher=U.S.News &amp; World Report, L.P.|year=2008|accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kiplinger]]'' magazine ranks Princeton as the best value among private universities, noting that the average graduating debt is US$4,957, &quot;about one fifth the average debt of students who borrow at all private schools.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.kiplinger.com/tools/slideshows/slideshow_pop.html?nm=CollegesLowDebt&amp;page=2 |title=1. Princeton University |publisher=''Kiplinger'' |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grade deflation policy====
In 2004, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, the Dean of the College, implemented a grade deflation policy to curb the number of A-range grades undergraduates received.&lt;ref name=&quot;On grade deflation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/12/02/24601/|publisher=Daily Princetonian|title=On grade deflation|year=2009|accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malkiel's argument was that an A was beginning to lose its meaning as a larger percentage of the student body received them.&lt;ref name=&quot;On grade deflation&quot;/&gt; While the number of A's has indeed decreased under the policy, many argue that this is hurting Princeton students when they apply to jobs or graduate school.&lt;ref name=&quot;On grade deflation&quot;/&gt; Malkiel has said that she sent pamphlets to inform institutions about the policy so that they consider Princeton students equally,&lt;ref name=&quot;On grade deflation&quot;/&gt; but students argue that Princeton graduates can apply to other institutions that know nothing about it. They argue further that as other schools purposefully inflate their grades,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/business/22law.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1277406249-7I3hc765HdqNtR0HmzFjDw|publisher=New York Times|title=In Law Schools, Grades Go Up, Just Like That|accessdate=2010-06-24 | first=Catherine | last=Rampell | date=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton students' GPAs will look low by comparison. Further, studies have shown that employers prefer high grades even when they are inflated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakadesuyo.com/does-obvious-grade-inflation-hurt-students|publisher=Barking up the wrong tree|title=Does Obvious Grade Inflation Hurt Students|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to remain in place even after Malkiel steps down at the end of the 2010â2011 school year. However, it should be noted that the policy deflates grades only relative to their previous levels; indeed, as of 2009, or five years after the policy was instituted, the average graduating GPA saw only a marginal decrease, from 3.46 to 3.39,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/education/31princeton.html?_r=1|publisher=New York Times|title=At Princeton University, Grumbling About Grade Deflation|accessdate=2011-01-28 | first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | date=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is less grade-inflated than before, but not, on an absolute scale, grade-deflated, and is unlikely to have a significant effect in employment and graduate school admissions.

===Graduate===
[[Image:ClevelandTowerWatercolor20060829.jpg|thumb|left|200px|This watercolor shows [[Cleveland Tower]] as seen from just outside Procter Hall at the Old [[Princeton University Graduate College|Graduate College]] in the noon autumn sun.]]
Princeton offers postgraduate research degrees in many fields in the social sciences, engineering, natural sciences, and humanities. Although Princeton offers professional graduate degrees in [[engineering]], [[architecture]], and [[finance]], it has no [[medical school]], [[law school]], or [[business school]] like other research universities.&lt;ref&gt;A short-lived [[Princeton Law School]] folded in 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; The university's most famous professional school is the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]], founded in 1930 as the School of Public and International Affairs and renamed in 1948 after university president (and US President) [[Woodrow Wilson]].

===Libraries===
The university's library system houses over eleven million holdings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firestone.princeton.edu|title=Firestone Library|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=2006-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; including six million bound volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/library/libraryfactsheet/alalibraryfactsheet22.cfm|title=The Nation's Largest Libraries: A Listing By Volumes Held â ALA Library Fact Sheet Number 22|publisher=American Library Association|date=May 2009|accessdate=2009-08-12}}: 6,778,675 volumes reported in May 2009 fact sheet; 6,495,597 reported by Princeton to the Association of Research Libraries in {{cite web|url=http://www.arl.org/stats/pubpdf/arlstat05.pdf|title=ARL STATISTICS 2004â05|year=2006|publisher=Association of Research Libraries, 21 Dupont Circle, NW, Suite 800, Washington, D.C. 20036, Telephone: (202) 296â2296, FAX: (202) 872â0884, email: pubs@arl.org|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main university library, [[Firestone Library]], which houses almost four million volumes, is one of the largest university libraries in the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/academics_101/libraries/ Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt; and among the largest &quot;open stack&quot; libraries in existence. Its collections include the [[Blickling homilies]]. In addition to Firestone library, many individual disciplines have their own libraries, including architecture, art history, East Asian studies, engineering, geology, international affairs and public policy, Near Eastern studies, and psychology. Seniors in some departments can register for enclosed carrels in the main library for workspace and the private storage of books and research materials. In February 2007, Princeton became the 12th major library system to join Google's ambitious project to scan the world's great literary works and make them searchable over the Web.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsMax&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/2/6/90039.shtml Princeton University Joins Google Literature-Scan Project]&quot;.

==Student life and culture==
[[Image:Walker-1903-cuyler.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Cuyler, Class of 1903, and Walker Halls are Princeton dormitories with Collegiate Gothic architecture.]]University housing is guaranteed to all undergraduates for all four years. More than 98 percent of students live on campus in dormitories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/profile/campus-life/ |title=Housing and Dining |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freshmen and sophomores must live in [[residential college]]s, while juniors and seniors typically live in designated upperclassman dormitories. The actual dormitories are comparable, but only residential colleges have dining halls. Nonetheless, any undergraduate may purchase a meal plan and eat in a residential college dining hall. Recently, upperclassmen have been given the option of remaining in their college for all four years. Juniors and seniors also have the option of living off-campus, but high rent in the Princeton area encourages almost all students to live in university housing. Undergraduate social life revolves around the residential colleges and a number of coeducational [[Eating club (Princeton University)|eating clubs]], which students may choose to join in the spring of their sophomore year. Eating clubs, which are not officially affiliated with the university, serve as dining halls and communal spaces for their members and also host social events throughout the academic year.

Princeton's six residential colleges host a variety of social events and activities, guest speakers, and trips. The residential colleges also sponsor trips to New York for undergraduates to see ballets, operas, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows, sports events, and other activities.
The eating clubs, located on Prospect Avenue, are co-ed organizations for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat their meals at one of the ten eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.

Princeton hosts two [[Model United Nations]] conferences, PMUNC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmunc.org/| title=Princeton Model United Nations Conference (PMUNC)|accessdate=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall for high school students and PICSim&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picsim.org/|title=Princeton Interactive Crisis Simulation (PICSIM)|accessdate=2006-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the spring for college students. It also hosts the Princeton Invitational Speech and Debate tournament each year at the end of November. Princeton also runs Princeton Model Congress, an event that is held once a year in mid-November. The 4-day conference has high school students from around the country as participants.

Although the school's admissions policy is [[need blind]], Princeton, based on the proportion of students who receive Pell Grants, was ranked as a school with little economic diversity among all national universities ranked by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-economic-diversity-among-top-ranked-schools|title=Economic Diversity Among All National Universities|accessdate=2008-10-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Pell figures are widely used as a gauge of the number of low-income undergraduates on a given campus, the rankings article cautions &quot;the proportion of students on Pell Grants isn't a perfect measure of an institution's efforts to achieve economic diversity,&quot; but goes on to say that &quot;still, many experts say that Pell figures are the best available gauge of how many low-income undergrads there are on a given campus.&quot;

==Athletics==
Princeton supports organized athletics at three levels: varsity intercollegiate, club intercollegiate, and intramural. It also provides &quot;a variety of physical education and recreational programs&quot; for members of the Princeton community. According to the athletics program's mission statement, Princeton aims for its students who participate in athletics to be &quot;'student athletes' in the fullest sense of the phrase.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.goprincetontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10600&amp;ATCLID=295151 |title=Princeton University Mission Statement |accessdate = 1 Jun 2011 |author=Princeton Athletic Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduates participate in athletics at some level.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/campuslife/athletics/ |title=Athletics &amp; Fitness |accessdate=1 Jun 2011 |author=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton's colors are orange and black. The school's athletes are known as ''Tigers'', and the mascot is a tiger. The Princeton administration considered naming the mascot in 2007, but the effort was dropped in the face of alumni opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2007/09/11/18534/ |title=Mascot revamped but still 'The Tiger' |author=Esther Breger |date=11 Sep 2007 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varsity===

[[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton's football team]] has a long and storied history. Princeton played against [[Rutgers University]] in the [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|first intercollegiate football game in the U.S.]] on Nov. 6, 1869. By a score of 6-4, Rutgers won the game, which was played by rules similar to modern rugby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp |title=The First Intercollegiate Game - November 6, 1869 |publisher=Rutgers University Scarlet Knights |accessdate=2 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today Princeton is a member of the Football Championship Subdivision of NCAA Division I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.championshipsubdivision.com/teams-stadiums-directory/ivy-league/princeton-tigers-princeton-stadium/ |title=Princeton Tigers, Princeton Stadium |publisher=Football Championship Subdivision |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of the 2010 season, Princeton had won 26 national football championships, more than any other school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/nchamps_team.php |title=Recognized National Championships by Team |publisher=College Football Data Warehouse |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Princeton Tigers men's basketball|men's basketball program]] is noted for its success under [[Pete Carril]], the head coach from 1967 to 1996. During this time, Princeton won 13 Ivy League titles and made 11 [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA tournament]] appearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/coachfile/pete_carril/index.html |title=Pete Carril |publisher=NBA |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carril introduced the [[Princeton offense]], an offensive strategy that has since been adopted by a number of college and professional basketball teams.&lt;ref name=carril-nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=Carril Is Yoda to Notion of Perpetual Motion |author=John Branch |newspaper=The New York Times |date=30 Mar 2007 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/30carril.html |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carril's final victory at Princeton came when the Tigers beat [[UCLA]], the defending national champion, in the opening round of the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1996 NCAA tournament]],&lt;ref name=carril-nyt /&gt; in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/ncaatourneyupset.html |title=When underdogs dance |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Princeton tied the record for the fewest points in a Division I game since the institution of the three-point line in 1986-87, when the Tigers scored 21 points in a loss against [[Monmouth University]] on Dec. 14, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap/_/id/253480163/monmouth-hawks-vs-princeton-tigers |title=Princeton loses lowest-scoring D-I game since 3-point line |author=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=15 Dec 2005 |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse|men's lacrosse program]] enjoyed a period of dominance 1992-2001, during which time it won six national championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usila.org/NCAAChampionHistory.htm |title=The NCAA Menâs Lacrosse Championship, formerly known as the Wingate Memorial Champion |publisher=U.S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Club and intramural===

In addition to varsity sports, Princeton hosts about 35 club sports teams.&lt;ref name=puathfit-main /&gt; [[Princeton Rugby|Princeton's rugby team]] is organized as a club sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=One of Princeton's oldest clubs flourishes |author=Ben Laguna |date=3 Apr 2008 |newspaper=The Daily Princetonian |url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2008/04/03/20695/ |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, nearly 300 teams participate in intramural sports at Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/studentguide/campus_culture/intramurals/ |title=The Student Guide to Princeton: Intramurals |publisher=Princeton University |accessdate=1 Jun 2-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intramurals are open to members of Princeton's faculty, staff, and students, though a team representing a residential college or eating club must consist only of members of that college or club. Several leagues with differing levels of competitiveness are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/campusrec/intramural/general-information/ |title=General Information |publisher=Princeton University Campus Recreation |accessdate=1 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games is Princeton Cannon Song, the Princeton University [[fight song]].

Bob Dylan wrote &quot;Day of The Locusts&quot; about his experience of receiving an honorary doctorate from the University. It is a reference to the negative experience he had and it mentions the cicada infestation of Princeton.

=== &quot;Old Nassau&quot; ===
&quot;[[s:Old Nassau|Old Nassau]]&quot; has been Princeton University's anthem since 1859. Its words were written that year by a freshman, Harlan Page Peck, and published in the March issue of the ''Nassau Literary Review'' (the oldest student publication at Princeton and also the second oldest undergraduate literary magazine in the country). The words and music appeared together for the first time in ''Songs of Old Nassau'', published in April 1859. Before the Langlotz tune was written, the song was sung to ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]'''s melody, which also fits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigernet.princeton.edu/~ptoniana/oldnassau2.asp| title=History of Old Nassau|accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Old Nassau does not only refer to the university's anthem. It can also refer to Nassau Hall, the building that was built in 1756 and named after [[William III of England|William III]] of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. When built, it was the largest college building in North America. It served briefly as the capitol of the United States when the Continental Congress convened there in the summer of 1783. By [[metonymy]], the term can refer to the university as a whole. Finally, it can also refer to a [[chemical reaction]] that is dubbed &quot;[[Old Nassau reaction]]&quot; because the solution turns orange and then black.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed054p167.2 The Old Nassau reaction â Journal of Chemical Education (ACS Publications and Division of Chemical Education)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==508 Princetonia==
The asteroid [[508 Princetonia]] is named for Princeton University by [[Raymond Smith Dugan|R. S. Dugan]], which he found during his time at [[Landessternwarte Heidelberg-KÃ¶nigstuhl|KÃ¶nigstuhl Observatory]] with [[Max Wolf]] in Heidelberg, Germany.&lt;ref name=jpl&gt;[http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=508;orb=0;cov=0;log=0;cad=0#phys_par JPL Small-Body Database Browser: 508 Princetonia (1903 LQ) (accessed 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered it in 1903 while working on his Ph.D. from [[Heidelberg University]].
