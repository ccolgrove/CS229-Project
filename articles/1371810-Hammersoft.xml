==Cable Television==
Seibert was [[MTV]]'s first [[creative director]] and guided its original voice and visual identity, creating hundreds of promotions, advertisements, and station IDs for the channel, and responsible for a rethinking of how television channels promoted themselves as &quot;brands.&quot; He also commissioned and approved the mutating MTV logo, despite network executives objections to a logo that did not remain constant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frankolinsky.com/mtvstory1.html &quot;MTV Logo Story&quot; Frank Olinsky dot com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seibert, Fred. [http://fredseibert.com/post/68774160/mtv-music-television-the-logo &quot;MTV: Music Television, The Logo ''FredSeibert.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; He led the team that developed one of the most famous advertising campaigns of the late 20th century, &quot;I Want My MTV!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fredseibert.com/tagged/IWMM &quot;I Want My MTV!&quot; Fred Seibert dot com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, with partner [[Alan Goodman]] at Fred/Alan Inc., Seibert successfully overhauled the then-floundering children's cable channel [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]], moving it from worst to first in the ratings in six months;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fredalan.org/post/66904670/from-worst-to-first-nickelodeon-network-ids-1984-1992 &quot;From Worst to First&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and conceived and executed the [[Nick-at-Nite]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fredalan.org/post/88541284/the-first-oldies-television-network &quot;The First Oldies Television Network&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Fred/Alan became the first branding company in television, working closely with [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], [[The Movie Channel]], [[VH-1]], [[Lifetime]], and [[Comedy Central]]. They are also credited with inventing the television [[marathon (television)|marathon]].

==Animation &amp; Cartoons==
Seibert became president of [[Hanna-Barbera]] Cartoons, Inc., in 1992, and turned around the struggling animation studio by revamping its production and development process. He created [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[What A Cartoon!]]'', a showcase for new [[animation|animated]] shorts which [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] several series including ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', and ''[[Courage The Cowardly Dog]]''. He remained at Hanna-Barbera until 1996, when H-B's parent company, [[Turner Broadcasting]], merged with [[Time Warner]].

Seibert founded animation production company [[Frederator Studios]] in 1997. Frederator currently has a first look production deal with Nickelodeon, and its productions include ''[[The Fairly OddParents]]'', ''[[ChalkZone]]'', ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]'', ''[[Nicktoons Film Festival]]'', ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'', ''[[Random! Cartoons]]'', ''[[Wow! Wow! Wubbzy!]]''. In 2009 he launched Frederator's (and Nickelodeon's) first original television CG comedy, ''[[Fanboy and Chum Chum]]'' to record ratings; and in early 2010 he produced his company's first [[Cartoon Network]] series, ''[[Adventure Time with Finn and Jake]]'', had the highest rated comedy premiere in the network's history.

==Internet Television &amp; Video==
In addition to his Frederator duties, Seibert returned to [[MTV Networks]] in 1999, and was president of MTV Networks Online, president of the MTVi Group, and president of Nickelodeon Online. After the [[dot-com bubble]] burst, he returned to Frederator full-time in 2001.

In November 2005 Seibert launched his innovative online network, the world's first cartoon video [[podcast]], which he calls ''Channel Frederator''. Filmmakers submit animated films for weekly exhibition. In quick succession was 'The Wubbcast' for pre-schoolers (with Bolder Media, in January 2006) and 'ReFrederator' with vintage cartoons (April 2006). 

Building on this new media success, in 2007 Seibert conceived and founded [[Next New Networks]] (with Emil Rensing, [[Herb Scannell]], Tim Shey, and Jed Simmons),&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Brad, The New York Times. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/technology/08network.html?_r=1 Internet Start-Up to Take a Hybrid Media Approach]&lt;/ref&gt; the leading online television company, with over 2 billion all time video views&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Miller, Liz. [http://gigaom.com/video/next-new-networks-nears-1b-views-profitability/ &quot;Next New Networks Nears 1B Views,Â Profitability&quot; ''GigaOM'']&lt;/ref&gt; and over 200 million views every month (as of 2010). Along with their affiliated ''[[Indy Mogul]]'', ''[[Barely Political]]'' (home of [[Obama Girl]]), ''Channel Frederator'' and several other networks, the company's  superdistribution has allowed it to become among the most widely-distributed video in the world, and to become [[YouTube]]'s top professional content provider. By the end of 2010, Next New Networks had the globe's top two videos viewed on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2010/12/31/that-was-the-year-that-was/ &quot;That Was The Year That Was&quot; Frederator Blogs, December 31, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Next New Networks was acquired by [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2011/03/supercharging-next-phase-in-youtube.html &quot;Supercharging the âNextâ phase in YouTube partner development&quot; The Official YouTube Blog, March 7, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/03/googles-youtube-buys-next-new-networks.html &quot;Google's YouTube Buys Next New Networks&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextnewnetworks.com/post/21554/here-comes-youtube-next &quot;Here Comes YouTube Next&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Seibert began his media career at [[Columbia University]]'s [[WKCR-FM]] in 1969 as a board engineer and producer/host of world music, jazz and pop shows. He recorded the majority of the station's live jazz broadcasts which led to the formation of his independent blues and jazz label. Roots musician and producer Tom Pomposello and Seibert formed [[Oblivion Records]] in 1972 (with third partner Dick Pennington), producing releases by blues musicians [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]] ('''[[Live in New York]]'''), [[Johnny Woods]], and Charles Walker ('''[[Blues from the Apple]]'''); and jazz musicians [[Joe Lee Wilson]] and Marc Cohen (now known as [[Marc Copland]]). He was a producer (and/or engineer) of over 30 jazz records (for independent labels like [[Muse Records]] and the [[Jazz Composer's Orchestra]]) between 1971 and 1978 by artists as diverse as [[Hank Jones]], [[Cecil Taylor]], [[Dom Salvador]] and [[Willis Jackson]]. 

In 1977 and 1978 he was the road manager and sound engineer for tours with pianist/composer [[Carla Bley]], before joining the innovative media executive Dale Pon at New York's [[WHN]] radio. Pon introduced Seibert to his [[WNBC Radio]] colleague [[Robert Pittman]] as Pittman was becoming an early cable television pioneer at the Warner Amex Satellite Company ([[WASEC]]), now named [[MTV Networks]]; Seibert subsequently became Pittman's first executive hire.

Seibert was born in [[Manhattan]], raised in [[Halesite, New York]]. He initially studied at [[Columbia University]]'s College of Pharmaceutical Sciences 1969-1971, then minored in History at [[Columbia College, Columbia University]], 1971-1973.
