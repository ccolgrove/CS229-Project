==History==
Cedar Bluff Broadcasting Company, Inc., received the original [[construction permit]] for a new FM radio station to serve [[Cedar Bluff, Virginia]], from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] on June 20, [[1988 in radio|1988]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fccp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BPH-19880106MF) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=108196 |date=June 20, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new station was assigned the [[call sign]] '''WJHT''' by the FCC on December 7, 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Call Sign History |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=6005&amp;Callsign=WHQX |publisher=FCC Media Bureau CDBS Public Access Database |accessdate=August 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WJHT received its [[broadcast license|license to cover]] from the FCC on March 15, 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;flic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BLH-19891214KD) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=137893 |date=March 15, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facing financial difficulties, Cedar Bluff Broadcasting Company, Inc., filed an application with the FCC in February 1992 to voluntarily assign its [[broadcast license]] to Richard A. Money, bankruptcy trustee.  The transfer was approved by the FCC on March 19, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BALH-19920221HH) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=170870 |date=March 19, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Money, in turn, reached an agreement to sell this station to the Raslor Corporation in March 1992.  The deal was approved by the FCC on June 5, 1992, and the transaction was finally consummated more than a year later on June 7, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BALH-19920311HA) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=171495 |date=June 7, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just two days later, Raslor Corporation applied to the FCC to transfer the license for WJHT to Bluefield Broadcasting Company, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on August 11, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on August 13, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BALH-19930609GG) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=187126 |date=August 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new owners had the FCC change the call sign to '''WBBY''' on August 27, 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;/&gt;

In October 1996, Bluefield Broadcasting Company, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to New Adventure Communications, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on November 29, 1996, and the transaction was consummated on January 31, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19961007GJ) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=233966 |date=January 31, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1997, New Adventure Communications, Inc., applied to transfer the WBBY license to Adventure Communications, Inc.  The deal was approved by the FCC on March 6, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on May 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-19970220GS) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=241588 |date=May 29, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station was assigned the '''WHQX''' [[call sign]] by the FCC on May 30, 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcc1&quot;/&gt;

In July 2000, Adventure Communications, Inc., reached an agreement to sell WHQX to [[Triad Broadcasting]] through its Monterey Licenses, LLC, subsidiary.  The deal was approved by the FCC on August 8, 2000, and the transaction was consummated on September 15, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BALH-20000727AAN) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=509764 |date=September 15, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of the licensee, the FCC modified WHQX's [[community of license]] from Cedar Bluff, Virginia, to Gary, West Virginia, effective September 30, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |title=Media Bureau Docket No. 02-316 |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2003/03-20947.htm |date=August 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
