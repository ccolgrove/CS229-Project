On August 23, 2010, FernÃ¡ndez passed her crown to [[Ximena Navarrete]], Miss Mexico. During her final catwalk, she unveiled a [[Flag of Venezuela|Venezuelan flag]] with only seven stars.  Venezuelan president [[Hugo ChÃ¡vez]] had ordered the flag changed from seven to eight stars in 2006. The display of the old flag was seen by [[Investor's Business Daily]] as a protest against the new policies of ChÃ¡vez.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Article/545008/201008251856/The-Killing-Fields-Of-Caracas.aspx |title=The Killing Fields Of Caracas |date=August 25, 2010 |publisher=Investors Business Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;
