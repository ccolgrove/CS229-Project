Students take a core of liberal arts courses providing a comprehensive foundation for many specific areas of study including: English, fine arts, history, mathematics, multicultural studies, natural science, philosophy, religious studies, social science and speech/drama. The college offers over 37 majors in both liberal arts and professional programs.

==History==
Mount Mercy University was founded as a two-year college for women in 1928 by the [http://www.sistersofmercycr.org/sisters/index.aspx  Sisters of Mercy of Cedar Rapids, Iowa]. The Sisters of Mercy, whose order was founded in 1831 by Catherine McAuley in Dublin, Ireland, have been active in Cedar Rapids since 1878. The college was an outgrowth of their concerns about the education of women.

In 1957, Mount Mercy became a four-year institution and awarded its first bachelorâs degree in 1959. The college received accreditation as a baccalaureate institution by the [http://www.ncacasi.org  North Central Association] in 1960. In 1968 the Sisters of Mercy transferred their legal authority and responsibility to a self-perpetuating independent board of which three members would always be Sisters of Mercy.  Mount Mercy College became coeducational in 1969. While integrating a strong liberal arts component, the college has always emphasized professional development from its early involvement, as a junior college, on business courses and teacher education. The departments of nursing, education and social work were accredited in the 1960s and 1970s as the four-year programs developed.  Begun in 1997, the [http://www.mtmercy.edu/index.php?id=352  ADVANCE program], a joint Mount Mercy University/Kirkwood Community College accelerated degree completion program for working adults meets an important community workforce development need.
