'''The Body Bag Game''' was a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game that was played on November 12, 1990 between the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and the [[Washington Redskins]] at [[Veterans Stadium]]. Its nickname comes from a comment by an Eagles player directed at a Redskins player: &quot;an Eagle reacted to one injured Redskin lying on the turf by yelling, 'Do you guys need any more body bags?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/redskins/longterm/book/pages/173.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and game==
This was the second game of the year between the two [[NFC East]] rivals.  The Redskins were two years removed from winning [[Super Bowl XXII]], but were an aging team, behind a new quarterback, [[Jeff Rutledge]].  The Eagles were in their fifth season under defensive mastermind [[Buddy Ryan]], but coming off two straight early playoff exits.  In the previous game, on October 21, the 3-2 Redskins beat the 2-3 Eagles 13-7, behind a rushing touchdown by [[Gerald Riggs]] and two [[Chip Lohmiller]] field goals.  The rematch would come three weeks later, on [[Monday Night Football]], with the second-place Redskins being 5-3 and the third-place Eagles being 4-4.  

The Eagles would score first, on a 30-yard interception return for a touchdown by defensive back [[William Frizzell]].  In the second quarter, the Redskins would tie the game 7-7 behind a Rutledge pass to tight end [[Don Warren]].  However, by the third quarter, the Eagles took control with three touchdowns.  The first came on a trick play, with running back [[Keith Byars]] throwing a 9-yard pass to [[Heath Sherman]].  The second came via the defense, with defensive end [[Clyde Simmons]] returning a fumble 18 yards.  The final touchdown was another pass to Sherman, this time by quarterback [[Randall Cunningham]].  The Redskins would finish the scoring in the fourth quarter, with [[Brian Mitchell (American football)|Brian Mitchell]] scoring on a one-yard run, but it would not lead to a comeback, with the Eagles winning 28-14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199011120phi.htm Pro-Football-Reference.com: Washington Redskins at Philadelphia Eagles - November 12th, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

During this game, eight Redskin players were injured, including starting quarterback Jeff Rutledge and backup [[Stan Humphries]]. Washington, already playing without quarterbacks [[Mark Rypien]] (who was injured earlier in the season) and [[Gary Hogeboom]] (inactive), had to end the game with rookie running back/kick returner Brian Mitchell at quarterback.

==Aftermath==
Following the Body Bag Game game the Eagles would go on to win five of their last seven under Cunningham, finish the season 10-6 and earn a wild card playoff berth, the fourth seed in the tough NFC.  The Redskins meanwhile also would win five of their last seven to finish the season 10-6, losing the number four seed spot to the Eagles.  Despite this, the Redskins would return to Veterans Stadium and defeat the Eagles in the [[1990â91 NFL playoffs#NFC: Washington Redskins 20, Philadelphia Eagles 6|Wild Card playoff game]], 20-6.  The Redskins would go on to lose to defending Super Bowl champion [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]] in the divisional round.  However, as told in the NFL Network presentation ''America's Game: The Story of the 1991 Washington Redskins'', coach [[Joe Gibbs]] and others pointed to this game as the foundation for the successes of the [[1991 Washington Redskins season|1991 Redskins]], who would go on to win [[Super Bowl XXVI]].
