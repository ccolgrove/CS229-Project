|work=Air Force Link |date=May 31, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born September 3, 1949) is a retired [[United States Air Force]] [[General (United States)|General]] who served as the 18th [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]].  Moseley is a fighter pilot with more than 2,800 flight hours, many in the [[F-15 Eagle]].

On 2 September 2005, Moseley assumed his final Air Force assignment as Chief of Staff of the Air Force&amp;mdash; the senior uniformed Air Force officer responsible for the organization, training and equipage of more than 700,000 active-duty, [[Air National Guard|Guard]], [[Air Force Reserve Command|Reserve]] and civilian forces serving in the [[United States]] and overseas. As a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the general and other service chiefs function as military advisers to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and the [[President of the United States|President]].

Moseley resigned from the Air Force at the request of [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] in June 2008 in the wake of a number of Air Force scandals, including a 2007 scandal related to the Air Force's handling of the security of nuclear weapons at [[Minot Air Force Base]].  On 11 July 2008, a formal retirement ceremony was held for General Moseley; he officially retired from the Air Force on 11 August 2008.

==Background==
Moseley was born in 1949 in [[Grand Prairie, Texas]]. He graduated from [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 1971 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Political Science]]. He earned a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] degree from Texas A&amp;M University in 1972, also in political science. He commanded the [[F-15 Eagle|F-15]] Division of the [[Air Force Fighter Weapons School]] at [[Nellis AFB]], [[Nevada]], the 33rd Operations Group at [[Eglin AFB]], [[Florida]], and the 57th Wing, the Air Force's largest, most diverse flying wing, also at Nellis. The general has served as the combat Director of Operations for Joint Task Force-Southwest Asia. General Moseley also commanded [[9th Air Force]] and [[United States Central Command Air Forces|U.S. Central Command Air Forces]] while serving as Combined Forces Air Component Commander for Operations in [[Operation Southern Watch]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. The general is a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]. He has been awarded the Order of National Merit (Officer) and the Order of National Merit (Commander) by the president of the French Republic. The [[Ordre national du MÃ©rite|Order of National Merit]] is the second highest French military award. He has also been awarded the [[United Arab Emirates]]' Military Medal, 1st Class, by the president of the U.A.E.

Moseley's staff assignments have been a mix of operational, joint and personnel duties. These include serving in [[Washington, D.C.]], as Director for Legislative Liaison for the Secretary of the Air Force; Deputy Director for Politico-Military Affairs for Asia/Pacific and Middle East, the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Chief of the Air Force General Officer Matters Office; Chief of Staff of the Air Force Chair and Professor of Joint and Combined Warfare at the [[National War College]]; and Chief of the Tactical Fighter Branch, Tactical Forces Division, Directorate of Plans, Headquarters U.S. Air Force.

Moseley assumed the position of Chief of Staff of the Air Force during a ceremony at [[Andrews Air Force Base]] on September 2, 2005.

Moseley personally &quot;adopted&quot; the [[United States Air Force Academy]] Class of 2009 as his own, and has gone out of his way to address the future leaders of the U.S. Air Force.  On March 8, 2007, the [[Grand Prairie ISD]] school board unanimously voted to name an elementary school opening in the 2007â2008 school year Mike Moseley Elementary School in honor of his achievements and as a native of Grand Prairie.

As a result of a series of high-profile scandals, Moseley, along with the Secretary of the Air Force, was forced to resign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 11 July 2008,  Moseley had his formal retirement ceremony at [[Bolling Air Force Base]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Former [[Secretary of the Air Force]], the Honorable [[Michael Wynne]] presided over the ceremony. Moseley officially retired from the Air Force on August 1, 2008.

==Thunderbirds &quot;Thundervision&quot; scandal==
Members of the [[United States Air Force]] were under investigation by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] for having awarded a $50 million contract for audio-visual presentation services to Strategic Message Solutions (SMS) of [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/05/19/national/w141413D78.DTL FBI Investigating $50M Air Force Contract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/mrs_panstreppon/2006/jun/15/while_the_troops_are_getting_their_heads_blown_off_in_iraq While troops get their heads blown off in Iraq...]&lt;/ref&gt; The contract involved the &quot;Thundervision&quot; project, meant to provide oversized video screens and perhaps content services during air shows that featured the Air Force Thunderbirds.  The investigation revolves around possible involvement of former Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. (ret.) [[John P. Jumper]], and Chief of Staff of the Air Force T. Michael Moseley.  It is suggested that the contract price was inflated, because a friend of the two generals, Air Force General (ret.) [[Hal Hornburg]], was associated with Strategic Message Solutions.  Two companies involved in the bidding process protested award of the contract in January 2006, one having offered comparable services for half as much.  The Air Force cancelled the contract in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/pressreleases/release.asp?storyID=123016466 Air Force terminates contract] The Official Web site of the United States Air Force&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 the DoD IG concluded that Moseley violated Federal rules and regulations by helping steer the Thunderbirds promotion contract to SMS.  The investigation found that Moseley gave SMS personal access to his office and direct access to USAF resources before the contract bid, including personnel and equipment.  The IG also concluded Moseley improperly solicited and accepted gratuities from the owner of SMS, including arranging for a friend to fly in the owner's vintage fighter plane and accepting dinner and an overnight stay at the SMS owner's home.&lt;ref&gt;Anglen, Robert, &quot;Air Force Chief Of Staff Acted Improperly Over Air-Show Deal, Feds Say&quot;, ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', July 17, 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 2009, Secretary of the Air Force Michael Donley issued Retired General Moseley a &quot;Letter of Admonishment in Retirement&quot; for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123171885 Air Force secretary takes action on DOD IG report] 10/8/2009 The Official Web site of the United States Air Force&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington, DC - Recent events have highlighted a loss of focus on certain critical matters within the Air Force. As the Air Force's senior uniformed leader, I take full responsibility for events which have hurt the Air Force's reputation or raised a question of every Airman's commitment to our core values. For the past 36 years I have been privileged to serve my country as an Airman in the United States Air Force in peacetime and combat. I was honored and humbled to be appointed the Air Force's 18th Chief of Staff and have been proud to serve our Airmen and their families. Upon taking office, I worked hard with Secretary Wynne to ensure the Air Force provided the right forces at the right time to help our Nation and allies win the Global War on Terror.

I think the honorable thing to do is to step aside. After consulting with my family, I intend to submit my request for retirement to Secretary Gates. The Air Force is bigger than one Airman, and I have full confidence that the Air Force will continue working with the Joint team to win today's fight, take care of its Airmen, and meet tomorrow's challenges. I love the Air Force and remain proud of America's Airmen.
