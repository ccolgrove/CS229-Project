'''War films''' are a [[film genre]] concerned with [[war]]fare, usually about [[navy|naval]], [[air force|air]] or [[army|land]] battles, sometimes focusing instead on [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], covert operations, [[Military education and training|military training]] or other related subjects. At times war films focus on daily military or civilian life in wartime without depicting battles. Their stories may be [[fiction]], [[historical drama film|based on history]], [[docudrama]], [[biographical]], or even [[alternate history]] fiction.

The term '''[[anti-war film]]''' is sometimes used to describe films which bring to the viewer the pain and horror of war, often from a political or ideological perspective.

==Genre==
[[John Belton]] identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of [[Hollywood]] production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the reintegration of veterans.&lt;ref&gt;Belton, John. ''American Cinema/American Culture''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994, pp. 165-171, ISBN 978-0070044661.&lt;/ref&gt; Film scholar Kathryn Kane has pointed out similarities between the war film genre and the [[Western (genre)|Western]]. Both genres use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame [[World War II]] as a conflict between good and evil as represented by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and [[Nazi Germany]] whereas the Western portrays the conflict between &quot;civilized&quot; settlers and the &quot;savage&quot; indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Kathryn. &quot;The World War II Combat Film&quot;. In: Wes D. Gehring (ed.) ''Handbook of American Film Genres''. New York: Greenwood Press, 1988, pp. 90-91, ISBN 978-0313247156.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeanine Basinger]] argues that a sub-genre, the ''World War II combat film'', emerged in 1943. This sub-genre depicts military action whereas the war film genre need not portray armed combat.&lt;ref&gt;Basinger, Jeanine.

==History==
===Beginnings===
One of the most influential silent films from the beginning of the twentieth century is ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915), the first half of which established many conventions for War films and Motion Pictures in general.  This film has been described as a great film for a terrible cause.  Protests and violence erupted in the wake of its opening and it became one of the first films to raise the issue of cinema's potentially detrimental effect on mass culture.  Notably the film depicts the [[American Civil War]] in a manner reminiscent of the First World War, which was happening overseas at the time of its release.

In 1914-1918, both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries like the United States. Among the most notable motion pictures was a film shot at the Eastern Front by cameraman [[Albert K. Dawson]]: The Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915). Dawson was attached to the German, Austrian and Bulgarian armies as an official war photographer. His documentaries were released by The American Correspondent Film Company.

===1920s and 1930s===
An early notable war film is [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[Shoulder Arms]] made in 1918. The film set a style for war films to come and it can be considered the first comedy about war in [[film history]]. Films made in the years following [[World War I]] tended to emphasise the horror or futility of warfare, most notably ''[[The Big Parade]]'' (1925) and ''[[What Price Glory? (1926 film)|What Price Glory?]] (1926)''.  With the sound era, films like ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930) (and its much darker [[Cinema of Germany|German]] counterpart ''[[Westfront 1918]]'')  , [[Howard Hawks]]' ''Road to Glory'' (1936) and ''[[Grand Illusion (film)|Grand Illusion]]'' (1937), focused on the futility of war for non-American soldiers whilst Hollywood produced American soldiers featuring in World War I comedies such as [[Buster Keaton]]'s ''Doughboys'' (1930) and [[Wheeler &amp; Woolsey]]'s '' Half Shot at Sunrise'' (1930), or exciting tales of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] putting down rebellions in [[Central America]], [[China]], and the [[Pacific Islands]] in films like [[Frank Capra]]'s ''Flight'' (1930), ''The Leathernecks Have Landed'' (1936) and ''[[Tell It to the Marines|Tell it to the Marines]] (1926 film)''.  Other films focused on the drama inherent in the new technology and fading [[chivalry]] of [[aerial combat]] in films such as ''[[Wings (film)|Wings]]'' (1927), ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930) and ''The Dawn Patrol'' ([[The Dawn Patrol (1930 film)|1930]] and [[The Dawn Patrol (1938 film)|1938]] versions).

===1940s===
The first popular war films during the [[Second World War]] came from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Germany]] and were often [[documentary film|documentary]] or semi-documentary in nature. Examples include ''[[The Lion Has Wings]]'' and ''[[Target for Tonight]]'' (British) and ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (German). 

By the early 1940s, the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film industry]] began to combine documentary techniques with fictional stories in films like [[Noel Coward]]'s ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (1942), ''[[Millions Like Us]]'' (1943) and ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944). Others used the medium of the fiction film to carry a propaganda message; about the need for vigilance (''[[Went the Day Well?]]'') or to avoid &quot;careless talk&quot; (''[[The Next of Kin]]''). 

The [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]] was passed by the [[United States Congress]] on September 16, 1940, becoming the first peacetime [[conscription]] in [[United States history]]. Hollywood reflected the interest of the American public in [[Conscription in the United States]] by having nearly every film studio bring out a military film comedy in 1941 with their resident comedian(s). [[Universal Pictures]]' [[Abbott and Costello]] came out with the first feature film on the subject ''[[Buck Privates]]'' and followed it with the team ''[[In the Navy (film)|In The Navy]]'' and in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] to ''[[Keep 'Em Flying]]''. [[Paramount Pictures]]' [[Bob Hope]] was ''Caught In The Draft'', [[Warner Brothers]] told [[Phil Silvers]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] ''You're In The Army Now'', [[Columbia Pictures]] put [[Fred Astaire]] in the army declaring ''You'll Never Get Rich'', [[Hal Roach]] gave his new comedy team of [[William Tracy]] and Joe Sawyer ''Tanks a Million'' and [[20th Century Fox]] had the former [[Hal Roach]] team of [[Laurel &amp; Hardy]] going ''[[Great Guns]]''. The minor studios such as [[Republic Pictures]] made [[Bob Crosby]] and Eddie Foy Jr ''Rookies on Parade'' and [[Monogram Pictures]] enlisted [[Nat Pendleton]] as ''Top Sergeant Mulligan''. However, the first comedians to hit the screen in an army comedy were [[The Three Stooges]] as ''[[Boobs in Arms]]''.

Serious 1941 films involving training for war included [[U.S. Cavalry]] in [[MGM]]'s ''The Bugle Sounds'', [[RKO]]'s ''Parachute Battalion'', [[Paramount Pictures]] ''I Wanted Wings'' and [[Warner Brothers]]' ''[[Dive Bomber (film)|Dive Bomber]]''.  [[20th Century Fox]] made the last pre-war military film about the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] ''To The Shores of Tripoli''.  When the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack occurred the studio reshot the ending to have [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]] reenlist in the Corps and march off with the Marines whilst his father implores him to 'Get a Jap for me'. 

Prior to [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Warner Brothers]] warned of ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]]'' whilst [[Producers Releasing Corporation|PRC]] told of ''[[Hitler, Beast of Berlin]]''.  A [[metaphor]] for America was [[Gary Cooper]] as the real life ''[[Sergeant York]]'' who went from [[hillbilly]] hell-raiser, to [[pacifist]], to a [[Conscription|draft]]ee comparing the [[Bible]] to the [[History of the United States]] and deciding that his [[marksmanship]] against the Germans was righteous.

After the [[United States]] entered the war in 1941 [[Hollywood]]  began to mass-produce war films. Many of the American dramatic war films in the early 1940s were designed to celebrate American unity and demonize &quot;the enemy.&quot;  One of the conventions of the genre that developed during the period was of a cross-section of the American people who come together with a common purpose for the good of the country, i.e. the need for [[mobilization]]. 

The American industry also produced films designed to extol the heroics of America's allies, such as ''[[Mrs. Miniver (film)|Mrs. Miniver]]'' (about a British family on the home front), ''[[Edge of Darkness (1943 film)|Edge of Darkness]]'' (Norwegian resistance fighters) and ''[[The North Star (1943 film)|The North Star]]'' (the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Communist Party]]). Towards the end of the war popular books became the source of films of higher quality and more serious tone, extoling more long-term values, including ''[[Guadalcanal Diary (film)]]'' (1943), ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944) and ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' (1945).

===1950s===
The years after World War II brought a large number of mostly patriotic war films, which used the war as a backdrop for dramas and adventure stories. Many films made in Britain drew on true stories, such as ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'' (1954), ''[[Dunkirk (film)|Dunkirk]]'' (1958), ''[[Reach for the Sky]]'' (1956) telling the life of [[Douglas Bader]] and ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' (1960). The immediate aftermath of the war in Hollywood avoided the action film and delved into problems experienced by the returning veterans, turning out a number of high quality films that included ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946), ''[[Battleground (film)|Battleground]]'' (1949), ''[[Home of the Brave (1949 film)|Home of the Brave]]'' (1949), ''Command Decision'' (1948), and ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' (1949). The latter two examined the psychological effects of combat and the stresses of command.

[[Hollywood]] films in the 1950s and 1960s were often inclined towards spectacular heroics or self-sacrifice in films like ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' (1949), ''[[Halls of Montezuma (film)|Halls of Montezuma]]'' (1950) or ''[[D-Day the Sixth of June]]'' (1956). They also tended to toward stereotyping: typically, a small group of ethnically diverse men would come together but would not be developed much beyond their ethnicity; the senior officer would often be unreasonable and unyielding; almost anyone sharing personal information - especially plans for returning home - would die shortly thereafter and anyone acting in a cowardly or unpatriotic manner would convert to heroism or die (or both, in quick succession). [[Twentieth-Century Fox]] made a succession of war films realistically filmed in black-and-white in the early 1950s that highlighted little-known aspects of World War II, among them ''[[The Frogmen]]'', ''[[Go for Broke! (1951 film)|Go For Broke!]]'', ''[[You're in the Navy Now]]'', and ''[[Decision Before Dawn]]''.

Another large group of films emerged from the plethora of popular war novels penned after the war. Their quality was largely dependent on their faithfulness to the plot or theme of the original, casting, direction, and production values. Much of their appeal for the American public was that they covered virtually every branch of the service involved in the war. These include: ''[[The Young Lions]]'' (1958), ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]'' (1958), ''[[Battle Cry (film)|Battle Cry]]'' (1955), ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), ''[[Captain Newman, M.D.]]'' (1963), ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'' (1954), ''[[Away All Boats]]'' (1956), ''[[The Enemy Below]]'' (1957), ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953), ''[[Kings Go Forth]]'' (1958), ''[[Never So Few]]'' (1959), ''[[The Mountain Road]]'' (1960), and ''[[In Harm's Way]]'' (1965).

===POW films===
A popular sub-[[genre]]  war films in the 1950s and '60s was the [[prisoner of war]] film. This was a form popularised in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and recounted stories of real escapes from (usually [[Germany|German]]) [[P.O.W.]] camps in World War II. Examples include ''[[The Wooden Horse]]'' (1950), ''[[Albert R.N.]]'' (1953) and ''[[The Colditz Story]]'' (1955). Hollywood also made its own contribution to the genre with ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963) and the fictional ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953). Other fictional P.O.W. films include ''[[The Captive Heart]]'' (1947), ''[[Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957), ''[[King Rat (1965 film)|King Rat]]'' (1965), ''[[Danger Within]]'' (1958), ''[[The Secret War of Harry Frigg]]'' (1968). Unusually, the British industry also produced a film based on German escaper [[Franz von Werra]], ''[[The One That Got Away (film)|The One That Got Away]]'' in (1957).

===1960s and 1970s===
By the early 1960s films based on  [[commando]] missions like ''The Gift Horse'' (1952) based on the [[St. Nazaire Raid]], and ''[[Ill Met by Moonlight (film)|Ill Met by Moonlight]]'' (1956) had begun to inspire fictional adventure films such as ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'' (1964), ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967) and ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968), which used the war as the backdrop for spectacular action films.  The latter films had American producers, stars and financing but were filmed in England or on location with British film crews, supporting actors, and expertise.

The late 1950s and 1960s also brought some more thoughtful big war films like [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]'s ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962), [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957),  and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' (1962) as well as a fashion for all-star epics based on battles which were often quasi-[[Documentary film|documentary]] in style and filmed in Europe where extras and production costs were cheaper. This trend was started by [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]'s production ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'' in 1962, based on the first day of the 1944 [[D-Day landings]]. Other examples included ''[[Battle of the Bulge (film)|Battle of the Bulge]]'' (1965), ''Anzio'' (1968), ''[[Battle of Britain (film)|Battle of Britain]]'' (1969), ''[[The Battle of Neretva]]'' (1969), ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' (1970), ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' (1970) (based on the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]]), ''[[Midway (film)|Midway]]'' (1976) and ''[[A Bridge Too Far (1977 film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977).

In Japan, war films from the Japanese perspective were popular, such as [[Japan's Longest Day]], [[Submarine I-57 Will Not Surrender]] (1959) and [[Battle of Okinawa]] (1971).
 
The war was not all about the prowess of the outfit shown in a film, the comedy genre used as well the war time as a background like in ''[[La Grande Vadrouille]]'' (1966) and ''[[Kelly's Heroes]]'' (1970).

Though trouble in [[Southeast Asia]] was shown in [[Jack L. Warner]]'s ''Brushfire'' (1961), and [[Marshall Thompson]]'s ''A Yank in Viet-Nam'' (1964) and ''To the Shores of Hell'' (1966), the major Hollywood studios refused to make any [[Vietnam War]] films with the exception of [[John Wayne]]'s ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' based on the best-selling book by [[Robin Moore]] and using the theme song &quot;[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]&quot;.  No Vietnam war films followed until [[Jack Starrett]]'s ''[[Nam Angels]]'' AKA ''The Losers'' (1970) filmed on Philippine sets left over from [[Robert Aldrich]]'s ''[[Too Late the Hero]]'' (also 1970).

===Post-Vietnam films===
The effects of the [[Vietnam War]] tended to diminish the appetite for fictional war films by the turn of the 1970s. American war films produced during and just after the Vietnam War often reflected the disillusion of the American public towards the war. Most films made after the Vietnam War delved more deeply into the horrors of war than films made before it (This is not to say that there were no such films before the Vietnam War). Later war films like ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' (set in WWII) and the [[black comedy]] ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (set in Korea), reflected some of these attitudes.

In the decades following the War, the American film industry produced many war films either critical of American involvement in Vietnam, depicting American war crimes or the negative effects of war on combatants. These films included works by the most prominent actors and directors in American film and garnering the highest accolades and commercial success including:
*''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976) â nominated for four [[Academy Awards]], directed by [[Martin Scorsese]].
*''[[Coming Home (film)|Coming Home]]'' (1978) â winner of three [[Academy Awards]], directed by [[Hal Ashby]].
*''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978) â  winner of five Academy Awards, including Academy Award for Best Picture, directed by [[Michael Cimino]].
*''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979) â winner of two Academy Awards, directed by [[Francis Ford Coppola]].
*''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987) â directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]].
*''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987) â directed by [[John Irvin]].
*''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989) â directed by [[Brian De Palma]].

[[Oliver Stone]] trilogy of Vietnam War films:
*''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986) â winner of Academy Award for Best Picture.
*''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989) â winner of two Academy Awards.
*''[[Heaven &amp; Earth (1993 film)|Heaven &amp; Earth]]'' (1993)

Another subgenre were films that portrayed the American government cynically by reflecting upon the [[Vietnam War POW/MIA issue]], the most known of which were ''[[Missing in Action (film)|Missing in Action]]'' (1984) and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985).

An exception was the 1982 South Korean-American production ''[[Inchon (film)|Inchon]]'' about a battle in the [[Korean War]], although both a critical and commercial failure.

===1990s to 2000s===
====World War II====
The success of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s realistic ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' in 1998 helped to usher in a revival of interest in World War II films. A number of these, such as ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' and ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]'' were aimed at the blockbuster market, while others, like ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]'', ''[[Dark Blue World]]'', ''[[Captain Corelli's Mandolin (film)|Captain Corelli's Mandolin]]'', and ''[[Charlotte Gray (film)|Charlotte Gray]]'', were more nostalgic in tone. Others were trying to represent a more harrowing side of the reality of the war such precursor movies as the german [[Joseph Vilsmaier]]'s ''[[Stalingrad (film)|Stalingrad]]'', [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s ''[[Das Boot]]'' and the later,  american, [[Terrence Malick]]'s ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]''. 

Other notable films and TV series of the period dealing with World War II include: 

''[[Band of Brothers (miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'',

==The military and the film industry==
Many war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation's military forces. The [[United States Navy]] has been very cooperative since [[World War II]] in providing ships and technical guidance; ''[[Top Gun]]'' is the most famous example. The [[U.S. Air Force]] provided considerable verisimilitude for ''[[The Big Lift]]'', ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'' and ''[[A Gathering of Eagles]]'', filmed on Air Force bases and using Air Force personnel in many roles.

Typically, the military will not assist filmmakers if the film is critical of them. Sometimes the military demands some editorial control in exchange for their cooperation, which can bias the result. Critics point out that the film ''Pearl Harbor'''s US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received by the US armed forces. For another example, the [[U.S. Navy]] objected to elements of ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suid|first=Lawrence|title=Guts &amp; Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2002|edition=2|pages=748|isbn=0813190185, 978-0813190181|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zB8J2ho-0k8C&amp;pg=PA609&amp;lpg=PA609|accessdate=2/12/2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the home nation's military will not cooperate, or if filming in the home nation is too expensive, another country's may assist. Many 1950s and 1960s war films, including the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning films ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', were shot in [[Spain]], which had large supplies of both [[Allied]] and [[Axis Powers|Axis]] equipment. The Napoleonic epic ''[[Waterloo (1970 film)|Waterloo]]'' was shot in [[Ukraine]] (then part of the [[Soviet Union]]), using Soviet soldiers. The D-Day scenes in ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' were shot with the cooperation of the [[Defense Forces (Ireland)|Irish army]] because the French couldn't afford to close down the real Omaha Beach due to it being a monument. All of the major sequences in ''[[Dark Blue World]]'' were shot in the Czech Republic, at a disused air force base. In the &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; example, the French Navy ([[Marine Nationale]]) assisted the production team with the French aircraft carrier [[Foch (R 99)|Foch]] and one [[Le Triomphant class submarine|SNLE]].
