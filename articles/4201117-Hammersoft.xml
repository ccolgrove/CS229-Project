'''Trifun Zivanovic''' (born on April 17, 1975 in [[Santa Monica, CA]]) is an American-born [[Serb]]ian [[figure skater]]. Born in the United States, Zivanovic competes internationally for Serbia.

==Career==
Through [[2001]], he competed for the [[United States]], twice capturing medals at the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. After 2001, he represented [[Yugoslavia]], his father's native country. He competed in the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] representing Serbia and Montenegro. Following the break-up of that country, Zivanovic competed for Serbia.

To qualify for the 2006 Olympics, Zivanovic needed to place in the top 24 at the 2005 [[World Figure Skating Championships]]. After failing to do that, he had another shot at qualifying by placing in the top six at the [[Karl Shafer Memorial]]. He placed ninth, but made the Olympic team after several skaters who qualified ahead of him had to withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;http://ww2.nwherald.com/pdf/olympics/zivanovic.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Zivanovic has the distinction of having competed at the [[World Figure Skating Championships]] representing four countries: the United States, Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, and Serbia. He is also one of the few skaters to have competed at both the [[Four Continents Figure Skating Championships]] and the [[European Figure Skating Championships]]. He is the first male singles skater to have competed at every senior-level ISU Championships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skatetoday.com/articles0405/022005.htm Skate Today : Zivanovic Makes History for Serbia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
