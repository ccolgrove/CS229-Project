[[Hajji]] '''Abdul Qadir Arsala''' (c. 1951 in [[Jalalabad]], [[Afghanistan]]-July 6, 2002 in [[Kabul]], Afghanistan) ({{lang-ar|Ø§ÙØ­Ø§Ø¬ Ø¹Ø¨Ø¯ Ø§ÙÙØ§Ø¯Ø±}}) was a former anti-[[Taliban]] leader in the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front]] (Northern Alliance) in [[Afghanistan]]. After the fall of the [[Taliban]] regime he became a [[Vice President]] of Afghanistan in the administration of [[Hamid Karzai]] as well as the Minister of Public Works. 

Abdul Qadir was the governor of his home province of [[Nangarhar]] from 1992 to 1996 before the [[Taliban]] gained power. He shortly retook the position after the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|fall of the Taliban regime]] in October 2001. The capital of Nangarhar is the famous city of [[Jalalabad]].

Qadir belonged to one of the most influential, affluent and prominent families in the east of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=Guardian20020708&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,751329,00.html | title=Abdul Qadir: Key leader in Afghan struggle| publisher=[[The Guardian]]| author=Meena Baktash| date=July 8, 2002| accessdate=2007-12-31| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qadir was the brother of [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]], a famous [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] anti-[[Soviet]] and anti-[[Taliban]] resistance leader who was executed in late 2001 by the [[Taliban]].

==Resistance against the Soviet invasion==

Abdul Qadir's involvement in Afghan politics predated the 1979 Soviet invasion, but, during the ensuing war, he was a key commander with the [[Hezb-e Islami Khalis]] faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt; After the fall of the Afghan communist regime in 1992 he was appointed governor of [[Nangarhar]] province in eastern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt;

==Resistance against the Taliban==
[[File:Massoud and Qadir 2.PNG|thumb|left|Abdul Qadir (left) and National Hero of Afghanistan [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]]]
On September 27, 1996, the Taliban took power in Kabul with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia. Qadir took refuge in neighbouring [[Pakistan]] in 1996, but soon ran into trouble with the authorities because of his anti-[[Taliban]] stand and left for [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt; For three years he shuttled between [[Dubai]], where he ran a successful trading business, and Germany until he returned to Afghanistan to join the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front]] led by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], fighting the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt; Qadir's presence in the alliance ensured its influence in the largely Pashtun east of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt;

The United Front included forces and leaders from different political backgrounds as well as from all Afghan ethnicities including Pashtuns, [[Tajik people|Tajik]]s, [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]]s, [[Hazara people|Hazara]]s or [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]]. From the Taliban conquest in 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[GhÅr Province|GhÅr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]]. [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] did not intend for the United Front to become the ruling government of Afghanistan. His vision was for the United Front to help establish a new government, where the various ethnic groups would share power and live in peace through a democratic form of government.

Qadir's younger brother [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]], a famous anti-Soviet resistance fighter, was assassinated by suspected [[Taliban]] agents on October 29, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt; Haq, involved in the campaign to topple the Taliban, had secretly re-entered Afghanistan from northwest Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt;  He was attempting to rally anti-Taliban support among the Pashtuns when he was captured by Taliban intelligence in the eastern region and executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt; This coincided with another rebellion in the south led by another anti-Taliban Pashtun [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Islamic Front]]-leader, [[Hamid Karzai]], who was more fortunate in evading Taliban attempts to capture him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian20020708&quot;/&gt;

==Islamic Republic of Afghanistan: Vice Presidency==

After the fall of the Taliban regime Qadir joined with two other leaders, [[Hazrat Ali]] and [[Hajji]] [[Mohammed Zaman]], to form the so-called [[Eastern Shura]].&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes2011207&gt;

He accompanied [[Hamid Karzai]] on a trip to Bonn in the fall of 2001. Subsequently Afghan president Karzai nominated Qadir to be one of the [[Vice President of Afghanistan|Vice Presidents of Afghanistan]], and Minister of Public Works. Qadir was alleged to have had connections with those engaged in Afghanistan's [[opium poppy]] trade.&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes20020709/&gt;

==July 6, 2002 (death)==

On July 6, 2002, Qadir and his son-in-law were killed by gunmen in a surprise attack with unknown motive. In 2004, one man was sentenced to death and two others to prison sentences for the killing.&lt;ref name=USDepStat&gt;

&lt;!--
    The following categories contain articles about individuals who almost 
    all have names that follow the style for Arabic names.
    Arabic names don't have European style surnames that are inherited, father to son.
    So, there is no point changing the order in which they are sorted in the categories.

    Thanks!
