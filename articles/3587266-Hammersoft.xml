The '''University of Illinois College of Medicine''' offers a four-year program leading to the [[MD degree]] at four different sites in [[Illinois]]: [[Chicago]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], and [[ChampaignâUrbana metropolitan area|UrbanaâChampaign]].

The Chicago campus of the College of Medicine is the administrative home for the dean and all other college-wide officers, as well as serving as the Chicago program site.  Located on the [[Near West Side, Chicago|Near West Side]] in one of the worldâs largest medical center districts, it is part of the UIC health science campus that includes the colleges of Applied Health Sciences, Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the School of Public Health.

Approximately 300 students graduate with the [[MD degree]] each year through the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|UIC]] system.{{When|date=July 2010}}

The College of Medicine has a total faculty in all sites of approximately 4,000,{{When|date=July 2010}} counting regular faculty and affiliates.

==History==
The College of Medicine, originally an independent institution, opened on September 26, 1882 as the '''College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago (P&amp;S)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medicine.uic.edu/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt; with 100 students and a faculty of 30. Five years later, the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois approved a contract of affiliation whereby the university would lease P&amp;S as its Department of Medicine. The arrangement continued until 1912 when there was a nine-month hiatus in the affiliation due to a lack of legislative support. It was only after the faculty and alumni of P&amp;S bought up all shares of the school's stock and presented them to the [[Board of Trustees]] as a gift that the school officially became the College of Medicine of the University of Illinois in March 1913.&lt;ref&gt;http://uillinoismedcenter.org/content.cfm/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
In addition to a traditional medical program, the college of medicine offers two physician-scientist training programs; the Medical Scientist Training Program ([[Medical Scientist Training Program|MSTP]]) in Chicago, an [[NIH]]-funded program that offers full tuition benefits and a stipend to the awarded students and the Medical Scholars Program (MSP) in Urbana-Champaign.
