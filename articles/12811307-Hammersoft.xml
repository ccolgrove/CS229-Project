'''Sarah Cairns''' was a barmaid in Angie's Den club. She first appeared when [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] and his friends pretended to have a [[stag party]] in order to get some free drinks. Martin got very drunk and was seen chatting up Sarah.

The following morning, Martin woke up in Sarah's bed. Martin admitted to Sarah that he had made a mistake as he was married, and Sarah seemed to back off. However, it soon emerged that Sarah was [[mental illness|mentally unstable]] and began to [[stalking|stalk]] Martin as well as send him [[text message]]s declaring her love for him. 

Sarah eventually ran in front of a car knowing that Martin's wife [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] would see. Sonia was a nurse, so she looked after Sarah and they became good friends. Meanwhile, Sarah had convinced herself that Martin loved her and that he would leave Sonia to be with her.

Martin kept the truth about Sarah from Sonia but Sarah had told Martin's family she was dating a &quot;certain&quot; married man, and later confessed to [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] that it was Martin.

Martin began to crack under pressure and went to the police, but they didn't believe him. While he was out, Pauline &quot;fell&quot; off a stepladder, and Sarah had disappeared. Martin tracked her down and threatened her until she confessed that she had pushed Pauline. He told Sarah he would kill her if she showed her face again.

Sarah called the police and Martin spent most of the day in the police station. During this time Sarah went to the Fowlers and told Sonia of Martin's deceit.

When Martin arrived, he apologised to Sonia and promised it meant nothing and would never happen again. When Sonia forgave him, Sarah refused to leave, still adamant that she and Martin were meant to be. She insisted he was different from any others. She finally admitted that although Martin fell asleep in her bed, they hadn't actually had sex.

Sarah realised she could never be with Martin so she stabbed Martin in his stomach with a pen knife. During the fight, Sonia picked up a fruit bowl, bashed Sarah on the head, and then called an ambulance for Martin. Sarah fell unconscious and was later committed to a mental institution.

[[Radio Times]] included Sarah in their feature profiling 'bunny boilers' and of her duration they stated: &quot;If she's not a regular on her way to being written out, she's a guest who appears, causes havoc, and then vanishes again. [...] Sarah was one such, a barmaid in E20 who stalked, harassed and finally stabbed Martin Fowler when he refused to dump Sonia. Last heard of in an institution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bunny&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McLean|first=Gareth|title=Soapland's top bunny-boilers|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/810-soaps-bunny-boilers/|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=([[BBC Magazines]])|accessdate=2011-01-01|date=29 November 2009&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vOscOXuK|archivedate=01 January 2011 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleesha's godparents are her uncle [[Mickey Miller|Mickey]] and (until her death in December 2006) neighbour [[Pauline Fowler]], whose heart softened towards the Millers since she accompanied Demi to hospital for Aleesha's birth. Aleesha was the centre of an ongoing feud between her maternal and paternal grandparents, with she and her parents bearing the brunt of the turmoil. Demi and Leo took her with them when they ran away together. They left her with her godmother Pauline when they had to move into a squat. This led to her father's death from a heroin overdose, when Demi took some heroin to numb her pain and Leo overdosed because he thought she was dead. Aleesha left Walford with [[Rosie Miller|Rosie]] and Demi on 7 July 2006 to live in the [[Cotswolds]].

'''Leo Taylor''', played by [[Philip Dowling]], was [[Demi Miller]]'s boyfriend. He first appeared in October 2004 visiting his and Demi's new born baby daughter [[#Aleesha Miller|Aleesha]]

In May 2005, the Millers returned to their former home in a block of flats whilst a rat problem in the square was being dealt with. Demi was reluctant, as it meant she was likely to bump into Leo. Upon their arrival, Leo's father Ray and his wife Trisha were the first people they saw, and they received a cold reception. Whilst taking Aleesha for a walk, Demi was teased by some of Darren's old friends, who mocked her and referred to her as &quot;[[Vicky Pollard]]&quot;. Upon heading back to the flats, Demi saw Leo and tried to escape in a lift, but Leo stopped her. They realised their split had been due to their parents meddling and denying contact between the two, and they reunited. Demi told Leo that it was Aleesha's christening the following day. Despite appearing reluctant, Leo and Trisha did indeed attend the christening, however the service was interrupted by Ray, who viciously dragged his wife and son away whilst a heartbroken Demi looked on. The christening continued back at Clint's flat, and Demi and Leo met later that evening from their balconies. As the feud between the Millers and the Taylors escalated, Leo planned to run away, and begged Demi to come with him. Demi agreed, but Leo abandoned her when she insisted on taking Aleesha. Demi returned to Walford, devastated, but was delighted when she met Leo near the swings. Leo promised her he'd keep in touch, and would wait as long as it took to be together.

Leo, Demi and Aleesha ran away, and Leo started dealing drugs. Demi took some of the drugs to numb her pain and she passed out. Leo returned to her and thought she was dead, so took a heroin overdose and died in hospital. This ending is a modern interpretation of that of [[Romeo and Juliet]] as much of the related storyline had been.

'''Frederick William &quot;Freddie&quot; Mitchell''' (nÃ©e '''Slater''') was played by [[twin]]s Alex and Tom Kilby. Freddie was conceived in late 2003 when his mother, [[Little Mo Mitchell]], was [[rape]]d by her father's friend, [[List of EastEnders characters (2003)#Graham Foster|Graham Foster]]. Her refusal to [[abortion|abort]] the child caused the break-up of her marriage to [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]. Mo went to stay with her sister, [[Belinda Peacock|Belinda]], where she gave birth to Freddie. In November 2004, after Graham was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, Little Mo and Billy made another attempt at their marriage, but they separated again after Billy admitted that he struggled to accept Freddie. Freddie then lived at the Slater household with Little Mo, his great-grandmother [[Mo Harris|Big Mo]], his grandfather [[Charlie Slater|Charlie]] and second cousin [[Stacey Slater|Stacey]].

In February and March 2006, Freddie caused his mother much stress by crying a lot. He took a trip to the park with his mother, [[Jane Beale|Jane Collins]] and [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]], where Bobby poked him in the forehead with a stick. Freddie had to go to hospital but was thankfully okay. However, the incident resulted in a visit from a health visitor. Mo thought that the health visitor was accusing her of abusing Freddie and became angry and hostile. Mo struggled to cope with her young son as when he was teething he often cried.

In May 2006, Freddie went to hospital seriously ill with bleeding on the brain. A few days before the hospital admission, Mo had admitted to her boyfriend [[Oliver Cousins|Oliver]], who is also a GP, that she sometimes got very irritated with Freddie when he cried.  When Oliver heard that Freddie's injury must have been caused by shaking or rough handling, he admitted what Mo had told him to a [[paediatrician]], [[List of EastEnders characters (2006)#Briony Campbell|Briony Campbell]], at the hospital. While the hospital believed that Mo may have shaken her son, Mo suspected that ten-year-old [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] may have hurt him in some way as they were left unsupervised together just before the incident. Mo went to confront Ben and ended up shaking him in irritation when he tried to run away. 

After extensive tests at the hospital, it was discovered that Freddie had a temporary low [[platelet]] count, due to an infection, meaning that any minor injury could hurt him badly, as his blood wasn't clotting properly. Mo was no longer suspected of hurting her son.

Freddie left [[Walford]] on 26 May 2006 with his mother who wanted to start a new life in [[Barnstaple]], [[Devon]].

'''Barbara Foster''' is the mother of [[Graham Foster]], who attended his rape trial in November 2004. When it came time for Barbara to testify, Graham berated her for telling the court about his contact with his other children. Graham was then found guilty.
