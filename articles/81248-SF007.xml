'''IBrowse''' is an [[Magic User Interface|MUI]]-based [[web browser]] for the [[Amiga]] range of computers, and was a rewritten follow-on to [[AMosaic|Amiga Mosaic]], one of the first web browsers for the Amiga Computer. IBrowse was originally developed for a company called [[Omnipresence]], now defunct. The original author has since continued development of IBrowse.

IBrowse supports some [[HTML]] 4, [[JavaScript]], frames, [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]], and various other standards. It was one of the first browsers to include [[Tabbed document interface|tabbed browsing]] as early as 1999 with IBrowseÂ².

A limited OEM version of IBrowse is included with [[AmigaOS 4]].

IBrowse has not been available for sale to new customers since April 2007 when their distributor quit Amiga market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amiga.org/forums/showthread.php?t=46919 | title=IOSPIRIT GmbH quits the Amiga market | date=23 March 2007 | accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although existing v2.x users can download and install the demo version over their existing installation in order to access all functionality.
