'''Heinz Heise''' is a [[publishing house]] based in [[Germany]].

== History ==

Heise was created in [[Hanover]] in 1949 as an address and [[telephone directory]] publisher, then later expanded to include magazines and loose leaf collections. In 2001, the company was divided into separate enterprises, all of which came under the umbrella of their parent company, the ''Heise Media Group''. Their turnover was in year 2008 at 108,7 million euro.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.heise-medien.de/allgemein/mediengruppe/HeiseMedienGruppe.pdf | format = PDF | page = 8 | title = Heise Medien Gruppe | accessdate = 2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006 [[Heise Security]] was launched in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heise.de/security/news/meldung/74980&lt;/ref&gt; It mostly featured translated news from the German site, but also featured locally relevant stories. The UK version of [[Heise Online]] came in February 2008. In February 2009, the UK site was renamed to ''The H'', and located at &lt;code&gt;h-online.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-online.com/features/Welcome-to-The-H-743417.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

Heise publishes the magazines ''[[c't]]'' (the computer magazine with the highest number of subscribers in Europe), ''[[IX (magazine)|iX]]'' (focusing on topics for IT professionals),  the German edition of ''[[Technology Review]]'' and the online magazine ''[[Telepolis]]''. These publications feed into the ''Heise News Ticker'', which ranks among the most successful [[German language]] news portals which includes a frequented user forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.heise.de/mediadaten/pdfs/2007/ho/pi_visit.pdf | format = PDF | title = Reichweite heise online und Mitbewerber 2005-06 | year = 2006 | publisher = [http://www.heise.de/mediadaten/online/en/ (rate card)] | accessdate = 2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also owns ''Heise Online'' (&lt;code&gt;heise.de&lt;/code&gt;), which, as of December 2009, is a top 1000 website in the world, and a top 50 site in Germany according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] [[web traffic|traffic]] rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/heise.de | title = heise.de | accessdate = 2009-12-25 | year = 2009 | work = [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
