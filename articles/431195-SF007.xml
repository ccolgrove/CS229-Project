'''Trac''' is an [[open source]], web-based [[project management]] and [[bugtracker|bug-tracking]] tool. The program is inspired by [[CVSTrac]], and was originally named ''svntrac'' due to its ability to interface with [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracSubversion |title=Trac and Subversion |publisher=Edgewall Trac |accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is developed and maintained by [[Edgewall Software]].

Trac is written in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]]. Until mid-2005, it was available under the [[GNU General Public License]]; since version 0.9, it has been released under a [[modified BSD license]].&lt;ref name=&quot;license&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracLicense | title=TracLicense - The Trac Project | publisher=Edgewall Trac | accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are [[free software license]]s.

== Features ==
Trac allows [[hyperlink]]ing information between a [[computer bug|bug]] database, [[revision control]] and [[wiki]] content. It also serves as a [[World Wide Web|web]] interface to the following [[revision control]] systems: [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]], [[Git (software)|Git]], [[Mercurial]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], [[Perforce]] and [[Darcs]]. Prior to version 0.11 the web front end presentation of Trac was handled by the [[ClearSilver]] [[web template system|template system]]. Starting with 0.11 an in-house template system called [[Genshi (templating language)|Genshi]] is used, although compatibility with ClearSilver based plugins will remain for several versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;clearsilver&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-01-27 |title=ClearSilver - The Trac Project |publisher=Edgewall Trac |url=http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/ClearSilver |accessdate=2007-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other features include:

* Project management (Roadmap, Milestones, etc.)
* Ticket system (bug tracking, tasks, etc.)
* Fine-grained permissions (since 0.11)
* Timeline of all recent activity
* Wiki (syntax similar to [[MoinMoin]])
* Customized reporting
* [[version control system|VCS]] web interface
* RSS Feeds
* Multiple project support (planned for post-1.0 versions)
* Environment extensibility (via Python plugins)
* [[iCalendar]] export&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracRoadmap |title=The Trac Roadmap |accessdate=14 September 2009 |publisher=Edgewall Trac}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multiple Repository Support per environment (since 0.12)
* Interface [[localization]]s (since 0.12)

== Adoption ==

Trac is reported to have more than 450 major installations worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;tracusers&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=2008-06-25 |title=Who uses Trac?|publisher=Edgewall Trac |url=http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracUsers |accessdate=2008-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the users of Trac is [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], which reports that it uses this tool to manage various deep space and near space projects; [[Twisted (software)|Twisted]], an asynchronous networking framework implemented in Python; the [[Dojo Toolkit]], one of the popular [[Open source]] [[JavaScript library]] projects; [[Piwik]], a free software equivalent to services like [[Google Analytics]]; and [[WordPress]], the popular blogging platform, all use Trac for bug tracking and as a source tree viewer. Some projects also use Trac's wiki.
