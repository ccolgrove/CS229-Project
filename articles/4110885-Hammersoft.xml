'''Frontier Midstates, Inc.''' is a telephone operating company of [[Frontier Communications]] serving [[Indiana]] and [[Michigan]]. It was originally owned by [[Contel]], and later purchased by [[GTE]], [[Verizon]], and Frontier. 
==History==
The company was established in [[1956]] to provide telephone service in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://corp.sos.state.ga.us/corp/soskb/Corp.asp?648814 Georgia Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt;. As a subsidiary of [[Contel]], it adopted the name '''Continental Telephone Company of the South'''. It expanded as it absorbed the operations various companies in [[Alabama]] and Georgia, including '''Alabama Telephone Company''' in [[1975]], '''Coosa Valley Telephone Company''', and '''Tri-County Telephone Company, Incorporated''' in [[1978]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://arc-sos.state.al.us/cgi/corpdetail.mbr/detail?corp=851750&amp;page=name&amp;file=W Business Entity Details, Contel of the South, Inc., Alabama Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt;. The company adopted its abbreviated name, '''Contel of the South, Inc.''', in [[1988]].

===Acquisition by GTE===
Contel was acquired by [[GTE]] in [[1991]] and the operating company began doing business as '''GTE Systems of the South'''. It was not associated with [[GTE South]], a separate operating company. 

On October 31, 1993, Contel of the South and [[Alltel]] traded service regions. Contel of the South regions in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] area were traded for [[Alltel]]'s [[Indiana]] and [[Michigan]] service regions.

===Acquisition by Verizon===
In [[2000]], GTE was purchased by [[Bell Atlantic]], becoming [[Verizon]]. Contel of the South began doing business as '''Verizon Mid-States''' and '''Verizon North Systems'''.

In [[2002]], [[Verizon]] sold its operations in [[Alabama]], including those from Contel of the South and [[GTE South]] to [[CenturyTel]]. Those operations became [[CenturyTel of Alabama]].

The company remained one of two former [[GTE]] operating companies to have retained its original name since acquisition by [[Verizon]] (the other is [[GTE Southwest]]); it also remained the only operating company using the Contel name.

===Sale to Frontier===
Contel of the South, along with several other Verizon wireline operating companies, were transferred to a new holding company [[Frontier Communications ILEC Holdings|New Communications ILEC Holdings]], which was acquired by [[Frontier Communications]] on July 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9NDc0NDl8Q2hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&amp;t=1 Frontier Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; Contel of the South, Inc., at that point, became '''Frontier Midstates, Inc.'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://carrier.frontiercorp.com/crtf/carrier/notifications/u/CCBFTR00033Request%20for%20Legal%20Names%20and%20Codes-Value1.pdf Frontier Requested Legal Name Changes, June 15, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
