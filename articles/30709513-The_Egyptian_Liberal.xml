There have been numerous '''domestic responses to the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]]'''. Opposition parties, activists and religious bodies have been staunchly demanding [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s resignation, with the exception of fearful Christian authorities, who called for staying away from the protests (although Christian individuals have taken part). The government has made ongoing attempts at media censorship, including briefly shutting down nearly all Internet traffic.

Mubarak has made some initial changes to quell dissent, including dissolving his government, and appointing military figure and former head of Egypt's intelligence service [[Omar Suleiman]] as Vice-President. Mubarak asked aviation minister and former chief of Egypt's Air Force, Ahmed Shafiq, to form a new government. Opposition to the Mubarak regime has coalesced around [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], with all major opposition groups, including the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], supporting his role as a negotiator for some form of transitional unity government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Registration required|date=February 2011}} {{cite news|author=Shadid, Anthony; Kirpatrick, David D. |title=Opposition Rallies to ElBaradei as Military Reinforces in Cairo|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/world/middleeast/31-egypt.html|accessdate=2011-01-31|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Before Mubarak's resignation ===
On 29 January, the head of the [[Shura Council|Egyptian Shura Council]]'s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, and also a part of the ruling party, said he does not believe the protests have ended yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2011|reason=needs better source}}Breaking News.

On 29 January, in response to the previous days' events, President Mubarak spoke on national television after midnight local time for the first time since the protests began. He said in his speech that despite a &quot;point of no return&quot; being crossed, national stability and [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] must prevail, that he had requested the government, formed only months ago, to step down, and that a new government would be formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2011|reason=needs better source}} Breaking News.

On 31 January, Mubarak swore in his new cabinet in the hope that the unrest would fade. The protesters did not leave and continued to demonstrate in Cairo's [[Tahrir Square]] to demand the downfall of Mubarak. The vice-president and the prime minister were already appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011131132324475241.html |title=Mubarak Swears in New Cabinet â Egypt's President Appoints New Cabinet in an Attempt To Quell Ongoing Mass Street Protests Against His Rule |work=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the new government to preserve subsidies, control inflation and provide more jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/201113101237787481.html |title=Mubarak Orders State Subsidies â Hosni Mubarak Ordered His New PM To Preserve Subsidies, Control Inflation and Provide More Jobs|work=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2011-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
===Protester demands===
[[File:A sign with with the protests demand.jpg|thumb|A sign with the protesters' omnibus demands]]
Opposition and civil society activists have called for changes to a number of legal and constitutional provisions which affect elections. Specifically they call for:
* Amendment of Article 76 of the Constitution to make it easier for party and independent candidates to get on the presidential ballot.
* Amendment of Article 77 to establish term limits for the presidency, which were removed from the Constitution in 1981.
* Amendment of Article 88 to restore full judicial supervision of elections. This would help tame election fraud and vote rigging, which are common in Egyptian elections.
* Amendment of Law 177 of 2005 in order to facilitate the formation of new political parties.
* Amendment of Article 179: Amendments in 2007 to Article 179 included an &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; measure, which allows for arbitrary arrest, searches and wiretapping without warrant, and transfer of any civilian court case of the presidentâs choosing to military tribunals. Unlike the Emergency law, it is a permanent measure and not a temporary measure requiring parliamentary approval.

In the Spring 2010, Mohamed El baradei began circulating a petition in the runup to the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2010]] calling for [[National_Association_for_Change#Platform|7 specific reforms]]:
# End the state of emergency.
# Ensure full judicial supervision of elections.
# Provide for domestic and international monitoring of elections.
# Ensure that all candidates have sufficient access to the media, particularly during the presidential election campaign.
# Allow Egyptians abroad to vote through embassies and consulates.
# Work toward a political system built on democracy and social justice.
# Provide the right to nomination for political office without obstacles, in accordance with Egyptâs obligations under the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights; limit the president to two terms.
# Allow voting by national identification card. These measures will require [[National_Association_for_Change#Goals|amending articles 76, 77, and 88 of the Constitution]] as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;egyptelections&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|url=http://egyptelections.carnegieendowment.org/2010/09/01/constitutional-and-legal-framework|title=Constitutional and Legal Framework|work=[[Carnegie Endowment]] |location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ElBaradei has also stated that &quot;the people (of Egypt) want the regime to fall&quot;.

Having returned after 30 years of exile from his native country of Egypt, [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] in [[Tahrir Square]] proclaimed,&quot;Egyptian people are like the genie who came out of the lamp and who have been in prison for 30 years&quot; and, âWe are not going back in until all our demands are met.â

He also made assuring statements about the [[Copts|Coptic]] minority:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The regime planted sectarianism here â¦ in Tahrir Muslims and Christians joined hands for a better Egypt&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also made demands including the dissolution of the current cabinet, release of thousands of political prisoners, end of the infamous state security services, and the end of the [[Gaza blockade]].

After the sermon thousands of protesters settled into prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0218/Egypt-revolution-unfinished-Qaradawi-tells-Tahrir-masses/ |title=Egypt revolution unfinished, Qaradawi tells Tahrir masses |publisher=Csmonitor.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January, the [[Egyptian Football Association]] announced that all [[Egyptian League]] games would be suspended in order to keep &quot;clubs from congregating.&quot; Yet the [[fan club]]s, know as &quot;[[ultras]],&quot; organised neighbourhood committees to provide security amidst looting and also to confront the police. The move was read by CNN as allowing for &quot;the poor, the disenfranchised, and the mass of young people&quot; to take part in the protests. One [[sports writer]] said that &quot;The involvement of organised soccer fans in Egypt's anti-government protests constitutes every Arab government's worst nightmare. Soccer, alongside Islam, offers a rare platform in the Middle East, a region populated by authoritarian regimes that control all public spaces, for the venting of pent-up anger and frustration.&quot; The move was also followed by a Libyan government directive to the [[Libyan Football Federation]] to cancel matches for the &quot;foreseeable future&quot; on concern over the unrest spreading.&lt;ref&gt;Zirin, Dave ([[essay]]) (31 January 2011).
