The '''Royal College of Defence Studies''' ('''RCDS''') is an internationally-renowned institution and component of the [[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]]. It was formerly called the '''Imperial Defence College'''.

The College is under a [[Commandant Royal College of Defence Studies|Commandant]], currently Vice Admiral Charles Style, CBE, and senior directing staff are [[two-star rank|two-star]] officers from the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]], [[Royal Air Force]], and [[British Civil Service|civil service]].

The RCDS Mission is:

:&quot;To prepare senior officers and officials of the United Kingdom and other countries and future leaders from the private and public sectors for high responsibilities in their respective organisations, by developing their analytical powers, knowledge of defence and international security, and strategic vision&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/rcds| title=The Royal College of Defence Studies |author=[[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Formerly the Imperial Defence College, RCDS owes its origins to the recommendation of a cabinet committee in 1922 presided over by [[Winston Churchill]], then Secretary of State for the Colonies. The college was founded in 1927 and was located at 9 [[Buckingham Gate]] until 1939. Its work in those days was chiefly concerned with defence of the [[British Empire|Empire]], with a population of 25 Members drawn from the UK, [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]].

The experience of the Second World War proved the benefits of such an institution for training senior service officers and governments and services of the Commonwealth for the college to resume its work. In 1946 the college reopened at its site at [[Seaford House]], [[Belgrave Square]]. This was the first time members from the United States attended the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.da.mod.uk/colleges/rcds/About_Us/A%20History%20of%20RCDS| title=A History Of RCDS |author=[[Defence Academy of the United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was renamed to &quot;Royal College of Defence Studies&quot; in 1970. The college celebrated its 80th Anniversary in 2007. The occasion was marked by a visit by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|HRH The Duke of Edinburgh]].

==RCDS Course==
RCDS forms a part of the Defence Academy of the United Kingdom. In fulfilment of its mission, the college runs one course a year, from January to December. Each course is attended by a maximum of 88 members, around one-third from UK and two-thirds from overseas. 75% are military officers of [[Colonel]]/[[Brigadier]] or equivalent rank. The remaining 25% are civil servants, diplomats, police officers and representatives from the private sector. All have been selected to attend the course on the strength of their potential to progress to a high position within their profession. Their average age is 46.

The course composition has been progressively widened to include members from over 33 different countries, including in recent years [[China]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Slovakia|Slovak Republic]] and [[Nepal]].

The course is a [[postgraduate]] level course in strategic leadership and international strategic studies with a focus on defence and security issues at the strategic level at which governments take decisions on these issues both nationally and within the international community. It runs annually over an academic year from September to July.

Those who attend the RCDS Course become Members of the college for life. Since 2001, course members have to option to study in a joint programme that leads to a [[Master of Arts|MA]] in International Security and Strategy from the [[Kingâs College London]].
