'''Antidisestablishmentarianism''' (listen to {{Audio-nohelp|Antidisestablishmentarianism.ogg|British sample}}, {{Audio-nohelp|Antidis.ogg|American sample}}) is a political position that originated in 19th-century [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in opposition to proposals for the [[disestablishment]] of the [[Church of England]], that is, to remove the [[Anglican Church]]'s status as the [[State religion|state church]] of [[England]], [[Ireland]], and [[Wales]].

The establishment was maintained in England, but in Ireland the [[Church of Ireland]] (Anglican) was disestablished in 1871. In Wales, four Church of England dioceses were disestablished in 1920, subsequently becoming the [[Church in Wales]].

The question of disestablishment of the Church of England is still current, often tied with the position of the English [[monarch]] as &quot;[[Supreme Governor]]&quot; of the Church (see [[Act of Settlement 1701]]). Those who wish to continue the establishment of the Church of England are referred to as Antidisestablishmentarians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kimberley Blaker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=5QTfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=antidisestablishmentarianism+england&amp;dq=antidisestablishmentarianism+england&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CJAbTa_RBc_-nAe5n-X1DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg|author=Kimberley Blaker|title=The fundamentals of extremism: the Christian right in America|publisher=New Boston Books|quote=Those who favored the Church of England were called antidisestablishmentarians.

==Word length==
The word is often referenced in English-speaking popular culture on account of its unusual length of 28 letters and 12 syllables. It is one of the [[longest words]] in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref name=oxforddic&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/page/longestword?view=uk What is the longest English word?] Oxford Dictionaries Online&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly believed to be [[Longest word in the English language|one of the  longest words in English]] found in major dictionaries (www.oxforddictionary.com), excluding coined and technical terms.&lt;ref name=oxforddic /&gt; A slightly longer but less commonly accepted variant of the word can be found in the [[Duke Ellington]] song &quot;You're Just an Old Antidisestablishmentarianismist&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donaldclarkemusicbox.com/encyclopedia/detail.php?s=1194 ELLINGTON, Duke] Donald's Encyclopedia of Popular Music&lt;/ref&gt; although the correct construction of that word would be &quot;antidisestablishmentarianist&quot; (without the &quot;ism&quot;) or &quot;antidisestablishmentarian&quot;. Another artist that uses the word Antidisestablishmentarianism is rapper [[Eminem]], in his song &quot;Almost Famous&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.ign.com/teh_vestibule/b5296/192675733/r193856614/ IGN Boards]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is also used by [[Lemon Demon]] in his song &quot;Word Dissociation&quot;.

[[J.E. Littlewood]] pointed out that the word is all &quot;form&quot; apart from the Latin stem ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sto#Latin st]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Littlewood's miscellany'' p.165 ISBN 052133702X&lt;/ref&gt;
