'''Nicholas Hugh &quot;Nick&quot; Brown''' (born 13 June 1950) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[politician]] who has been the [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Newcastle upon Tyne East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne East]] since [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]]. He has served as [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]], [[Department for Work and Pensions|Minister of State for Work and Pensions]], [[Chief Whip|Deputy Chief Whip]], and was the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government's]] [[Chief Whip]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page17065 Number 10 Press release]&lt;/ref&gt; until May 2010.

==Early life==
Brown was brought up in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], attending [[Tunbridge Wells Grammar School for Boys]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} before studying at the [[University of Manchester]]. After graduating, he worked in advertising for [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], but in 1978 he moved to be Legal adviser to the Northern Region of the [[GMB (trade union)|GMBATU]], based in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1980 he was elected to Newcastle City Council, representing Walker ward. His role in the union gave him a role in maximising the union's influence in Labour Party selections.

==Political career==
When [[Michael Thomas (UK politician)|Mike Thomas]], the sitting Labour MP for [[Newcastle upon Tyne East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newcastle upon Tyne East]], defected to the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]], Brown was chosen as the new Labour Party candidate for the seat, easily keeping it for Labour in the 1983 general election. He went on to the Labour front bench in 1985 as a spokesman on Legal Affairs; from 1988 he was a Treasury spokesman and from 1994 he shadowed Health.

Originally elected the Commons in the same year as [[Gordon Brown]] and [[Tony Blair]] he was initially close to both men but over time he became his namesake Brown's staunchest ally, though the two are unrelated.  In the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|1994 Labour leadership election]] he acted as Brown's unofficial campaign manager, and according to Brown's biographer Paul Routledge, advised against him pulling out of the contest in Blair's favour.

In 1995 he was appointed Deputy Chief Whip and played a central role in the close Parliament in trying to defeat the Conservatives. After Labour's [[united Kingdom general election, 1997|election]] victory in 1997, he was appointed [[Chief Whip]], but stayed there only for a year, moving to the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] in 1998. This move, which followed the publication of the Routledge biography earlier that year, was widely seen as a demotion, and ascribed to his close connection with Brown. Not long after this, he was forced by the [[News of the World]] newspaper in 1998 to announce that he is [[homosexual|gay]]. This he did with characteristic good humour, telling an audience of farmers: &quot;It's a lovely day. The sun is out - and so am I.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK Politics - Gay minister speaks out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/210301.stm|work= |publisher=BBC News|date=1998-11-08|accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His tenure at MAFF saw several animal health crises ending with the [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|2001 foot and mouth crisis]]. Brown's handling of the outbreak, which some in the media and politics used to attack the government, was criticised, though throughout he maintained the support of the farming and food industries and the veterinary profession. Suggestions that a [[vaccination]] strategy should have been practised in preference to the culling of hundreds of thousands of animals, made with the benefit of hindsight, did not help his cause, and he was demoted out to be the Minister of Work, with non-voting Cabinet rank, at the [[Department for Work and Pensions]] after the general election of 2001. In June 2003, he was dropped from the Government altogether, receiving the news of his axing by Tony Blair during the course of a party held to mark his 20 years as an MP.

Brown remains closely allied to Gordon Brown. In 2004 he was one of the organisers of a rebellion over the government's proposals for student finance, but hours before the vote announced that he had received concessions from the Government and would now support it. It was suspected that the Chancellor had ordered him to back down, but the affair cost him some credibility. On 29 June 2007 he was announced as Brown's new Deputy Chief Whip and Minister for the North East. Following a government reshuffle, he was returned to his original government position of Government Chief Whip, retaining his position as Minister for the North East.

In 2009, Brown was put in charge of investigating questionable expense claims by Labour MPs. According to '' [[The Daily Telegraph]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/5346633/MPs-expenses-Nick-Brown-claims-18800-for-food-without-receipts.html|title=MPs' expenses: Nick Brown claims Â£18,800 for food without receipts|publisher=Telegrapgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 2004 and 2008, he himself claimed a total of Â£87,708 for his constituency home including Â£18,800 for food. Allowances sought, without submission of receipts, included Â£200 a month for repairs, Â£200 a month for service and maintenance and Â£250 a month for a cleaner.

In 2007-08, Brown's mortgage interest repayments totalled Â£6,600, but he also claimed a total of Â£23,068, just Â£15 below the maximum allowable amount for the year. The claim included Â£4,800 for food â the maximum allowable amount â Â£2,880 for repairs and insurance, Â£2,880 for services, Â£897.65 for cleaning, Â£1,640 for phones and Â£1,810 for utilities. Brown, however, has pointed out that he saved the taxpayer a considerable amount of money by turning down a Government car and driver upon being made Chief Whip, the annual cost of which would have been around Â£100,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-evening-chronicle/2009/05/12/mps-expenses-north-east-minister-opens-up-72703-23601259/ ''Chronicle Live'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he was granted the freedom of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne, on the same day as [[Alan Shearer]]. Brown is a supporter of the [[British Humanist Association]]. On 29 September 2010, newly elected Labour Party leader [[Ed Miliband]] asked Brown not to stand for re-election as Opposition Chief Whip due to the need for a &quot;break from the past&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11436851 BBC report on Ed Miliband comments re Nick Brown re-election bid]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 29th January 2010, during the [[News of the World phone hacking affair]], Brown revealed that his landline may have been bugged in an &quot;ameturish attempt&quot; in 1998, around the time of his outing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/my-landline-was-bugged-as-papers-tried-to-out-me-says-nick-brown-2197771.html|author=|title=My landline was bugged as papers tried to 'out' me, says Nick Brown |work=The Independent |date=2011-01-29 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also contacted by police in the West of England in 2003 who told him that they were pursuing a phone-tapping prosecution and he was one of those who may have been targeted. The case collapsed when it reached court and full details of the allegations were never disclosed. Brown said that &quot;Given that it was near [Prince Charles' home] Highgrove, my assumption was that this might involve the Royal Family. But I was never explicitly told that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Independent&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=July 2011}}
