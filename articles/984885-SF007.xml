'''Windows NT 3.51''' is the third release of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows NT]] line of [[operating system]]s.  It was released on 30 May 1995, nine months after [[Windows NT 3.5]]. The release provided two notable feature improvements; firstly NT 3.51 was the first of a short-lived outing of [[Microsoft Windows]] on the [[PowerPC]] [[Instruction set architecture|architecture]]. The second most significant enhancement offered through the release was that it provides [[client/server]] support for interoperating with [[Windows 95]], which was released three months after NT 3.51. [[Windows NT 4.0]] became its successor a year later; Microsoft continued to support 3.51 until 31 December 2001.

==Overview==
The release of Windows NT 3.51 was dubbed &quot;the PowerPC release&quot; at Microsoft.  The original intention was to release a PowerPC edition of NT 3.5, but according to Microsoft's David Thompson, ''&quot;we basically sat around for 9 months fixing bugs while we waited for IBM to finish the Power PC hardware&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Paul Thurrott |title=Windows Server 2003: The Road To Gold - Part One: The Early Years |url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/winserver2k3_gold1.asp |publisher=SuperSite for Windows |date=24 January 2003 |accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Editions of NT 3.51 were also released for the [[x86 architecture|x86]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], and [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] architectures.

New features introduced in Windows NT 3.51 include [[PCMCIA]] support, [[NTFS]] file compression,&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc767961.aspx Optimizing NTFS]&lt;/ref&gt; replaceable [[WinLogon]] ([[Graphical identification and authentication|GINA]]), 3D support in [[OpenGL]], persistent IP routes when using TCP/IP, automatic display of textual descriptions when the mouse pointer was placed on toolbar buttons (&quot;tooltips&quot;) and support for Windows 95 common controls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/124814 Windows NT 3.51 Product Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the significant difference in the kernel base, Windows NT 3.51 is readily able to run a large number of [[Win32]] applications designed for [[Windows 95]]. Most recent 32-bit applications will not work as the developers have prevented their application from working with any Windows version earlier than Windows 98, also because some applications do not work properly with the older Windows NT 3.51 interface. Despite this, Microsoft in their application releases muddied the issue, releasing [[32-bit]] versions of [[Microsoft Office]] right up to Office 97 SR2b, but relying upon [[16-bit]] versions of [[Internet Explorer]] technology. This is probably because 32-bit versions of [[Internet Explorer 4|Internet Explorer 4.0]] and later integrated with the Windows 95 desktop, and NT 3.51 still used the Windows 3.1 desktop. Later on, up to [[Internet Explorer 5|IE 5.0]], but not later 5.x versions, were offered.

===NewShell===
On 26 May 1995, Microsoft released a test version of a shell refresh, named the ''Shell Technology Preview'', and often referred to informally as &quot;NewShell&quot;. This was the first incarnation of the modern Windows GUI with the Taskbar and Start menu. It was designed to replace the Windows 3.x Program Manager/File Manager based shell with [[Windows Explorer]]-based [[graphical user interface]]. The release provided capabilities quite similar to that of the Windows &quot;Chicago&quot; ([[Microsoft codenames|codename]] for Windows 95) shell during its late beta phases; however, it was intended to be nothing more than a test release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=John D. Ruley |title=NT Gets the Look But Not the Logo |url=http://winmag.com/library/1995/0995/09howtoc.htm  |work=How-To Columns |publisher=WinMag |date=September 1995 |accessdate=4 September 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060314223207/http://winmag.com/library/1995/0995/09howtoc.htm |archivedate = 14 March 2006}} Internet Archive&lt;/ref&gt; There was a second public release of the Shell Technology Preview, called ''Shell Technology Preview Update'' made available to [[MSDN]] and [[CompuServe]] users on 8 August 1995. Both releases held Windows Explorer builds of 3.51.1053.1.  The Shell Technology Preview program never saw a final release under NT 3.51. The entire program was moved across to the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo]] development group who finally integrated the new shell design into the NT code with the release of NT 4.0 in July 1996.

Five [[Service pack|Service Packs]] were released for NT 3.51, which introduced both bug fixes and new features. Service Pack 5, for example, fixed issues related to the [[Year 2000 problem]].

NT 3.51 was the last of the series to run on an [[Intel 80386]] processor. This, its ability to use [[High Performance File System|HPFS]] partitions (which Windows 2000 and later could not),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview of FAT, HPFS, and NTFS File Systems |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100108 |publisher=Microsoft |date=7 May 2007 |accessdate=4 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its ability to run at least some of the common control API, means that it still finds a place for occasional use on older machines. Windows NT 3.51, like other versions of Windows NT.3x, has some compatibility with OS/2 1.x Applications; however, the applications were to be in text mode.

Windows NT 3.51 supports IDE, EIDE, [[SCSI]] and [[Enhanced Small Disk Interface|ESDI]] hard drives. The only EIDE addressing schemes supported are [[Logical block addressing]], ONTrack Disk Manager, EZDrive, and Extended cylinder-head-sector.
