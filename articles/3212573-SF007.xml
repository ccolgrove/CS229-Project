'''Humanos''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[Humans]]) is the name of a musical band from [[Portugal]] formed in 2004. The idea behind it was to bring to light some unreleased songs by a famous Portuguese artist, a singer-songwriter from the 1980s, [[AntÃ³nio VariaÃ§Ãµes]]. 

[[David Fonseca]], [[Manuela Azevedo]] (the lead singer of another Portuguese music group, [[ClÃ£]]), [[CamanÃ©]] (one of the most famous Portuguese ''[[Fado|fadistas]]''), SÃ©rgio Nascimento (a member of [[SÃ©rgio Godinho]]âs band), HÃ©lder GonÃ§alves (also from [[ClÃ£]]), Nuno Rafael and JoÃ£o Cardoso are the seven members of a group responsible for what became an unmatched success at that point in the Portuguese music scene. 

The homonymous album ''Humanos'' scored quintuple platinum status, staying for weeks in #1. &quot;Muda de Vida&quot;, &quot;Maria Albertina&quot; and &quot;Rugas&quot; are just some of the group hits. 

All this culminated in three sold out concerts, two of them in Coliseu dos Recreios ([[Lisbon]]) and the other in [[Porto]]. There was also another memorable performance, in front of a crowd of 40,000 people, at the ''[[Festival do Sudoeste]]'' Portuguese summer music festival, in 2005. 

Humanos however was a short-lived project, as there were few unreleased AntÃ³nio VariaÃ§Ãµesâ songs. Thus, the release, in November 2006, of a [[CD]] and a [[DVD]] recorded at the Coliseu concerts, marked the end of the Humanos project.

All songs by Humanos were written by AntÃ³nio VariaÃ§Ãµes who recorded them as demos only and kept them in a shoe box, found after his death.
