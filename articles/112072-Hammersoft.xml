'''Carterville''' is a city in [[Williamson County, Illinois|Williamson County]], [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]], and is geographically situated between [[Carbondale, Illinois]] and [[Marion, Illinois]]. The city is located next to [[Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge]]. The Refuge's {{convert|44000|acre|km2}} of land and water contain a wide diversity of flora and fauna [http://www.stateparks.com/crab_orchard.html].  As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city population was 5,496. Carterville's long serving Mayor is Bill Mausey [http://www.fws.gov/midwest/planning/craborchard/FinalEIS/Chapter6.pdf]. The city is part of the Carbondale-Marion combined statistical area and city has grown considerably as a residential community of [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]].

==History==
Carterville was founded by George M. McNeill and Laban Carter. McNeill married Olive Herrin of Herrin Prairie and, in 1866, they settled on the farm that is now known as Carterville. The Co-founder, Carter, came to Williamson County in 1864, and purchased {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of land and helped organize and secure a post office for Carterville in 1871. Later the town was named in Carter's honor [http://www.cssbonline.com/page.htm]. McNeill was one of the youngest members of the [[Union army]] during the [[American Civil War]].  He enlisted at 16 and was with [[General Sherman]] during his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]][http://www.cssbonline.com/page.htm].

==Education==
Carterville is home to [[John A. Logan College]], named for the local American Civil War hero and politician [[John A. Logan]].  A college of approximately 8,000 students, John A. Logan College has been featured in [[Rolling Stone]] Magazine as the nation's fifth best community college and in 2004 was recognized as one of the fastest growing community colleges in the nation [http://www.herrinfesta.com/pages/news_jalc.php].

The Carterville Unit 5 Schools' athletic programs have been successful in the past, winning the IHSA State Conference Championship in Class 3A football in 1996 and in Class 2A softball in 2008. [http://www.ihsa.org/activity/fb/records/team1-2.htm].

==Football==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
Beginning in 1995, [[Carterville High School]] has reached the IHSA playoffs for 15 straight seasons. This span includes four quarterfinals appearances (2000,2004,2005,2007) and one state title in 1996. Carterville boasts an overall record of 137-27 during that span.

In August 2008, Carterville unveiled a new outdoor athletic complex. The addition includes a football field with an artificial playing surface that sports a large &quot;C&quot; at midfield and also includes an all-weather track, enabling the school to host track meets for the first time in many years.

It has been a long-time tradition during Carterville football games that &quot;The Cannon&quot; is shot off after every Lions' touchdown. &quot;The Cannon&quot; is an actual [[American Civil War]] cannon that is owned privately by a resident family of the town. The noise of the cannon was so loud that visiting fans were often taken aback at the boom, which could be heard throughout much of the town. &quot;The Cannon&quot; has become synonymous with the Carterville football tradition. Despite concerns of &quot;The Cannon&quot; being retired along with the old field, it has been taken out to the new complex and can still be heard following every Lions' score.

Carterville has been a long-time member of the Black Diamond Conference. Other Black Diamond schools include Johnston City, Christopher, Zeigler-Royalton, Sesser-Valier, Elverado, Hamilton County, Fairfield, [[Carmi-White County High School|Carmi-White County]], Trico, Vienna, as well as a few other schools for particular sports. In 2010, Carterville moved to the River to River Conference's Mississippi Division featuring larger schools such as DuQuoin, Anna-Jonesboro, Pinckneyville, Nashville, and Sparta. This switch has been made due to Carterville's rapid increase in enrollment, along with their football domination within the BDC.
