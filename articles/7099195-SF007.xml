'''NetDrive''' is a drive mapping utility based on [[Webdrive]] technology initially developed by South River Technolologies and licensed by [[Novell]] for distribution with [[Novell]] [[NetWare]] servers. NetDrive uses the iFolders protocol to map a drive letter on a Windows workstation to a [[NetWare]] server.  This software's features are: 

*Data transfer by drag and drop files in Windows explorer
*Able to execute .exe files including video and audio files
*Able to run NetDrive as a system service when Windows starts
*Mounts drive automatically on system start
*Support FTP, WebDAV, iFolder and SFTP.

The software has been discontinued by Novell, and is no longer available from that company.
