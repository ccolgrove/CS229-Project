==History==
===Founding===
[[Image:Conanthallnc.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of Conant Hall circa 1838]]
The college was originally founded in 1815 as Nichols Academy.  The founder was Amasa Nichols, a wealthy industrialist in [[Dudley, Massachusetts|Dudley, MA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Nichols&quot;&gt;[http://nichols.edu/highschool/whynichols/historynichols/index.html History of Nichols]&lt;/ref&gt; The school is the oldest in Worcester County, and one of the oldest in the country. Early benefactors of the academy included textile manufacturers [[Samuel Slater]] and Hezekiah Conant.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Nichols&quot;/&gt; Nichols Academy closed its doors in 1909 but the closing was only temporary.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Nichols&quot;/&gt;

===Conrad's reign===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Currier centernc.jpg|thumb|right|The Currier Center was built in 1893]] --&gt;
In 1931, James L. Conrad founded Nichols Junior College at the closed Nichols Academy location.  The college was a men-only college, and was the first junior college in Massachusetts to be granted the authority to grant an associates degree in Business Administration.  With the exception of a few years being closed during World War II, when President Conrad was called to serve, the junior college would expand and grow through 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Nichols&quot;/&gt;  The expansion started in 1948 and it lasted until the school began to award Bachelor's degrees.  The School during this ten year span purchased, constructed, and remodeled over forty-four buildings to shape most of the current campus that is seen today.
In 1958, the college became a four-year institute, and was granted authority to grant a Bachelor in Business Administration degree. 1965 saw more change, the College was accredited by the New England Association of School and Colleges.  In 1971, the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education authorized the College to award Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, and Bachelor of Science in Public Administration degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Nichols&quot;/&gt;  In 1974, it was granted the authority to grant the degree of Master of Business Administration.  1980 was the last big change for a while, but was almost an important aspect to the current university. Nichols established the Institute for American Values (renamed the [[Robert C. Fischer Policy and Cultural Institute]] [http://www.nichols.edu/currentstudents/fischerinstitute/] in 1999, and unrelated to the New York-based [[Institute for American Values]] founded in 1987) as a division of the College, providing a forum for the free exchange of ideas.

===Today===

In the early 1990s, Davis Hall was built as a new classroom building that featured &quot;smart classrooms.&quot;  Shamie Hall was built in the mid-1990s as a residence hall that features dorm rooms with private bathrooms. Of the original buildings two remain, Conant Hall which was constructed in 1835 and the Currier Center from 1893.  These two buildings help keep the heritage of the original Nichols Academy to its current day campus. In 2005, the MBA program was one of the largest in Central Massachusetts, having awarded 1380 MBA degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. News Report&quot;/&gt;
Between 1997 and 2007, the college expanded its academic offerings and building expansion.  During that time frame, new specializations for students included Sports Management, Criminal Justice Management, and an Educator Preparation program (grades 5-12).  The graduate division also expanded its offerings to include two new MBA concentrations; one in Sports Management and one in Security Management.  The college also began offering a Masters in Organizational Leadership.  A new athletic sports complex was built, as well as the football field being redeveloped as Vendetti Field.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. News Report&quot;/&gt;  Two new residence halls which offer, Kuppenheimer Hall and Remillard Hall, expanded living quarters for a growing enrollment.

===Worcester Campus===
The [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] campus is the newest of the schools campuses.  The campus is in downtown Worcester.

The campus is shared with [[Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences]].  The Building is located on Foster Street near the Worcester Train Station.  This location is mostly used by graduate students at Nichols.  The campus is in an ideal and central location for night students.  Also, being located in Worcester allows many of the graduate students to apply their footprint directly in the area and have a working/learning relationship.  The campus is also in an ideal location for traditional students, because the Worcester campus is only fifteen minutes north of the main Dudley campus.
