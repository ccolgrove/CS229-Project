{{2007 Big Ten football standings}}
The '''2007 Iowa Hawkeyes football team''' represented the [[University of Iowa]] during the [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2007 college football season]]. Heading into the season, several players left the team while several other players ran into criminal allegations. Following a disappointing [[2006 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|2006 season]] that included losses to [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana]], [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]] and [[University of Minnesota|Minnesota]], the team was coached by [[Kirk Ferentz]] and played their six home games at [[Kinnick Stadium]] in [[Iowa City, Iowa|Iowa City]], [[Iowa]].

[[File:Kinnick Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|Players prepare to play Montana on September 2, 2006.]]
Entering 2006 ranked 16th in the [[AP Poll#College football|AP Poll]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 2006 Associated Press NCAA Football Rankings - Week 1|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankings?pollId=1&amp;seasonYear=2006&amp;weekNumber=1 |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17th in the [[Coaches Poll]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 2006 USA Today NCAA Football Rankings - Week 1 |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/rankings?pollId=2&amp;seasonYear=2006&amp;weekNumber=1 |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hawkeyes had high hopes for the season. Following victories over [[University of Montana|Montana]], [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]], [[Iowa State University|Iowa State]] and [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Illinois]], the Hawkeyes were 4-0 heading into their game with top-ranked [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]]. With tickets for the game going for [[United States Dollar|$]]500 on [[eBay]], the game was hyped as one of the biggest in Kinnick Stadium history.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = No. 13 Iowa gears up for historic night at Kinnick Stadium |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/preview?confId=&amp;gameId=262732294 |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But [[quarterback]] [[Drew Tate]] threw 3 [[interceptions]], and the Hawkeyes lost 38â17. In total, Iowa had 4 turnovers while Ohio State had zero.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Heisman display: Smith tosses 4 TDs as No. 1 Ohio State rocks Iowa |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?confId=&amp;gameId=262732294 |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the loss to Ohio State, Iowa proceeded to score a season-high 47 points in a victory over Purdue. But the most notable score came during the 4th quarter, when [[Adam Shada]] intercepted a [[Curtis Painter]] pass and returned it a school record 98-yards for the [[touchdown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa blasts Purdue in first game since Ohio State drubbing |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=262802294&amp;confId=null |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Iowa's joy would not last long, as the Hawkeyes were upset by Indiana only a week later. The 31â28 win was Indiana's biggest win since a victory over 9th-ranked Ohio State in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Hardy reels in 3 TDs as Indiana shocks No. 15 Iowa |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=262870084&amp;confId=null |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From there, the season unraveled, and the Hawkeyes lost four of their remaining five games en route to a 6-6 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa 2006 Football Schedule/Results |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/teamsched?teamId=2294&amp;year=2006 |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Hawkeyes came out against [[University of Texas|Texas]] in the [[2006 Alamo Bowl]] with renewed energy, and quickly jumped out to a two touchdown lead. Later, after three straight Texas scores, Iowa once again took the lead 21â20. But it was not enough to win the game, as Texas won 26â24 behind the record-tying performance of freshman quarterback [[Colt McCoy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = McCoy ties freshman TD mark in Horns' Alamo Bowl win |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?confId=&amp;gameId=263642294 |publisher = ESPN |date = |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Before the season ==

On April 20, 2007, it was announced by Ferentz that two players, [[Ryan Bain]] and [[Justin Edwards (football player)|Justin Edwards]], were leaving the team. Both are planning on transferring to other schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;HR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Bain, Edwards leaving Iowa |url = http://iowa.rivals.com/content.asp?cid=665797 |publisher = HawkeyeReport.com |date = 2007-04-20 |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bain, who had 56 career tackles, was later found guilty on charges of disorderly conduct.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gazette1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Former UI football player found guilty of disorderly conduct |url = http://www.gazetteonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070601/SPORTS/70601009/1003/SPORTS |publisher = Cedar Rapids Gazette |date = 2007-06-01 |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About two months later, it was announced that [[Shonn Greene]] and [[Amari Spievey]] were no longer on the team. Greene, a junior [[running back]], had 378 rushing yards and two touchdowns in his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;HN2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Greene, Spievey leaving Iowa |url = http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?cid=680716 |publisher = HawkeyeReport.com |date = 2007-06-06 |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another month later, and it was announced that [[Lucas Cox]] and [[Marcus Wilson]] were leaving the team. Wilson, a sophomore [[defensive back]], played in all 13 games in 2006 and recorded 21 tackles and one interception.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Cox and Wilson Leave Hawkeyes |url =http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072607aab.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2007-07-26 |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in July, senior defensive back [[Devan Moylan]] was given an additional year of eligibility. After suffering a leg injury in the fourth game of 2006 against Illinois, he applied for a medical hardship. Prior to the 2007 season, he had 28 tackles and one interception in his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;HS2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Moylan Granted Additional Year |url = http://hawkeyesports.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/071007aaa.html |publisher = HawkeyeSports.com |date = 2007-07-10 |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criminal charges ===
On August 20, 2007, two Hawkeye [[wide receivers]] were arrested and charged with the unauthorized use of a [[credit card]]. [[Dominique Douglas]] and [[Anthony Bowman]], both sophomores,  were suspended indefinitely by Ferentz following allegations that they bought more than $2,000 in merchandise with stolen credit cards. The crime is a [[felony]], and if convicted, the two players can face up to five years in [[prison]] along with a $7,500 fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPNCC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa wideouts Douglas, Bowman suspended after arrest |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2983050 |publisher = ESPN |date = 2007-08-20 |accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another player, [[Arvell Nelson]], also experienced trouble with the law. Nelson posted a $545 bond for failure to appear in court after being charged with driving with a suspended license. He also paid a $390 fine for not having insurance.&lt;ref name=&quot;DMR1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Backup quarterback Nelson posts bond |url = http://www.dmregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070822/SPORTS020502/708220401/1003/SPORTS&amp;lead=1 |publisher = Des Moines Register |date = 2007-08-22 |accessdate = 2007-08-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070825163806/http://www.dmregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070822/SPORTS020502/708220401/1003/SPORTS&amp;lead=1 |archivedate = August 25, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schedule notes===

Due to the [[Big Ten]]'s rotating schedule, Iowa will not play either [[2007 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] or [[2007 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] in 2007. Instead, Iowa will play [[2007 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] and [[2007 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], two teams that the Hawkeyes have not played against since 2004.

Iowa's schedule was ranked as the 9th toughest (or 3rd easiest) in the Big Ten by [[SI.com]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Big10schedule&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Big Ten schedule rankings |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/ncaa/06/18/schedules.bigten/2.html |publisher = SI.com |date = 2007-06-21|accessdate = 2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind a strong defensive performance, the Hawkeyes shut out the [[Syracuse Orange]] at [[Kinnick Stadium]]. Rebounding from a shaky performance against Northern Illinois, Christensen threw for 278&amp;nbsp;yards and four touchdowns, three of them to [[tight end]] [[Tony Moeaki]]. On special teams, [[Kenny Iwebema]] blocked two [[Field goal (football)|field goals]] to help preserve the worst loss for Syracuse coach [[Greg Robinson]] in his tenure with the Orange. After the game, Syracuse [[running back]] [[Curtis Brinkley]] said:
{{cquote|We need to be a lot more fundamentally sound, there were a lot of missed assignments and there were a lot of people not hitting their targets. There's a little bit of everything we need to fix up.}}

The 35-point loss was Syracuse's most-lopsided since a 51â14 loss to [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] in the 2004 [[Champs Sports Bowl]].

Iowa was unable to contain a scoring explosion from Indiana, including three early touchdowns by Hoosier quarterback [[Kellen Lewis]]. Iowa added to its difficulties with penalties and breakdowns in pass protection. Although quarterback [[Jake Christensen]] passed for 308&amp;nbsp;yards and three touchdowns, he was sacked nine times, including four by Jammie Kirlew. The Hawkeyes also missed two field goals and an extra point.

Quarterback [[Jake Christensen]] was sacked twice, and the Hawkeyes were held scoreless until an interception near the Penn State end zone set up Trey Stross' 4th quarter touchdown reception in a 27â7 blowout loss on the road at Penn State.

Entering the game, Iowa had lost eight straight [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] games, with their last win a 47â17 decision over Purdue on October 7, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;losingstreak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = (18) Illinois vs. Iowa|url = http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200710130028|publisher = Yahoo!

From the very beginning, the game was a defensive one. The Hawkeyes held Illinois [[running back]] Rashard Mendenhall to 67&amp;nbsp;yards, and slowed the nation's fifth-best rushing offense to 137&amp;nbsp;yards total.&lt;ref name=&quot;Illinoisrecap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa 10, (18) Illinois 6|url = http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/recap?gid=200710130028|publisher = Yahoo! Sports|date = 2007-10-13|accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Illinois defense remained strong against the run, and held the Hawkeyes to a three yards per rush average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Illinibox&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Iowa 10, Illinois 6|url = http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/boxscore;_ylt=Ah8RHIt8Fd36ZxkMJXatBDXyvbYF?gid=200710130028|publisher = Yahoo!

Illinois did not trail until late in the third quarter, when Iowa [[quarterback]] [[Jake Christensen]] found [[tight end]] Brandon Myers down the middle for the [[touchdown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Illinoisrecap&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Illinibox&quot;/&gt; With the score at 10â6 in favor of the Hawkeyes, the Illini made a switch to Eddie McGee at quarterback, after starter [[Isiah Williams]] had a fumble recovered by Iowa. With McGee in, the Illini appeared to have stunned the [[Kinnick Stadium]] crowd with an 83-yard touchdown pass, but it was called back due to an Illinois penalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Illinoisrecap&quot;/&gt;

Despite the penalty, Illinois was not done. On Illinois' final drive, McGee drove the Illini down to the Iowa 12 with passes of 28 and 24&amp;nbsp;yards to Arrelious Benn. But with 1:12 left in the game, a McGee pass was [[Interception (American football)|intercepted]] at the goal line by Iowa's Brett Greenwood. The win was Iowa's first over a ranked team since 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Illinoisrecap&quot;/&gt;
