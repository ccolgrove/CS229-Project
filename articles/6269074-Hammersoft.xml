It was formerly known as '''Daytime WB''', which aired on the defunct [[The WB Television Network]].

==History==
[[Image:Daytime WB logo.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The logo for Daytime WB.]]
''Daytime WB'' was created because the former holder of its timeslot [[Kids' WB]] shared more and more of its programming with [[Cartoon Network]] because of the 1996 [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner]]-[[Time Warner]] merger. Eventually, Cartoon Network was out rating [[Fox Kids]], and airing Kids' WB! became financially unattractive as broadcast stations started showing only [[live-action]] [[talk shows]] and [[sitcom]] reruns in the afternoon to compete and go after a different audience, figuring children had all moved to watching cable networks in the afternoons.

On May 31, 2005, The WB announced the discontinuation of the weekday Kids' WB! block as of December 31, 2005. Kids' WB continued to air weekdays after this, but with redundant programming and theme weeks until January, and more promotion of Cartoon Network's afternoon [[Miguzi]] block and Kids' WB! Saturday during the transition. After Daytime WB started, Kids' WB's Saturday morning lineup was expanded by one hour.

The block continues on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], which replaced The WB in their merger with [[UPN]] on September 18, 2006, under the unofficial name: The CW Daytime. On-air promotions for the afternoon block (which air quite rarely) do not give it an actual name. The only description given by the network's [http://www.cwtv.com website] is that it's a &quot;Monday-Friday '''afternoon block''' from 3:00-5:00PM (ET/PT) as well as a Sunday '''encore block''' from 5:00-7:00 PM (ET/PT) outside of prime time.&quot; The Sunday block (formerly a component of The WB's &quot;Big Sunday&quot; schedule) was discontinued in September 2009 when the network ended Sunday programming completely. Today, the majority of CW stations will air [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution| NBCUniversal]] syndicated talk shows [[The Jerry Springer Show| Jerry Springer]], [[The Steve Wilkos Show]], and [[Maury (TV series)| Maury]] during daytime hours.

Since fall 2008, [[Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution]] has held responsibility for the block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6557272.html Warner Bros. to Take Over Daytime Programming for The CW], ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', May 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since fall 2008, when [[The CW4Kids]] block (currently known as [[Toonzai]]) premiered, 4Kids has shown one half hour of programming on The CW Daytime in the fall. A premiere episode of ''[[Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight]]'' from the [[CW4Kids]] block aired in early September 2009 to promote the series, as well as the pilot for ''[[Tai Chi Chasers]]'' in 2011. Previews for the block aired in 2008 and 2010.

On September 7, 2009, Warner Bros.'s ''[[The Tyra Banks Show]]'' moved from first-run syndication exclusively to CW Daytime, with a repeat &quot;best-of&quot; segment in the first hour, while a new episode aired in the next hour.&lt;ref&gt;Paige Albiniak, [http://www.broadcastingcable.com/CA6616542.html EXCLUSIVE: Tyra Banks's Talk Show Shifting From Syndication To CW], ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'', November 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tyra Banks|Banks]] announced the discontinuation of the series in December 2009, with the program's finale coming in late May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvwatch.people.com/2009/12/28/tyra-banks-says-goodbye-to-talk-show&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the 2010-11 season, the network aired one repeat episode of Banks' show (''The Best of Tyra'') per day until September 16, 2011. In the 2011-12 television season, the new daytime talk series [[Drew Pinsky|Dr. Drew]]'s [[Lifechangers]], a program produced as had ''Tyra'' by Warner Bros. studio [[Telepictures]], airs an original episode in the first half hour, and an encore in the second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadline.com/2011/01/cw-to-carry-dr-drew-daytime-show CW to Carry Dr. Drew Daytime Show], ''Deadline.com'', January 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/462248-Exclusive_CW_Calls_In_Dr_Drew_For_New_Daytime_Show.php Exclusive: CW Calls In Dr. Drew for New Daytime Show], ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', January 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
