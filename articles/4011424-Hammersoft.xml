==Early years==
[[Image:Akkari-jeg er dansker.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Aalborg Stiftstidende, February 1994
&quot;I am Danish. 15-year-old Ahmed would rather leave his family than go to Lebanon&quot;]]
Ahmed Akkari was born in [[Lebanon]] in 1978. In 1985 the Akkari family came to [[Denmark]], where they obtained [[Right of asylum|asylum]], but returned to [[Lebanon]] in 1990. Upon their return to Denmark a year later they found they did not qualify as refugees again, because the [[Lebanese Civil War]] was over. With the support of some Danish local media, which featured young Ahmed as a model immigrant, they were granted a humanitarian residency permit in 1994. Ahmed Akkari subsequently went to high school and trained as a teacher in [[Ãrhus]]. He became a Danish citizen in 2005 &lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}} {{cite news|date=2006-02-14|publisher=Ekstra Bladet|title=Akkari: Jeg taler ikke med Ekstra Bladet|url=http://www.ekstrabladet.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=335018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}} {{cite news|date=2006-02-16|publisher=Ekstra Bladet|title=Akkari: Akkaris Dobbeltspil|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=335215}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made him eligible to be evacuated from Lebanon again in 2006.

== Conviction for violence ==
In 2001 Ahmad Akkari was sentenced to 40 days in prison for beating an 11-year old schoolboy on 3. November 2000 because the boy had allegedly been bullying Akkari's little sister. The sentence was suspended because Akkari was a first time offender. Akkari, who was studying to be a teacher at the time, was present that day at Muslim private school [http://www.lykkeskolen.dk/ Lykkeskolen] in Aarhus where he was working as an apprentice teacher. According to sources at the school quoted in Ekstra-Bladet, his 11-year-old sister was playing with a boy from her class and the boy accidentally pulled her headscarf off. Akkari sought out the boy, pulled his ear drawing blood, and threw him to the ground kicking him several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}} {{cite news|date=2006-02-15|publisher=Ekstra Bladet|title=Ahmed Akkari: Volds-imam (Ahmed Akkari: Imam of violence)|url=http://www.ekstrabladet.dk/nyheder/politik/article175618.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}}{{cite news|date=2006-02-15|publisher=Jyllands-Posten|title=Imam undskyldte vold mod 11-Ã¥rig (Imam apologized for assault on 11-year-old)|url=http://www.jp.dk/login?url=aar/artikel:aid=3558312}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}} {{cite news|date=2006-02-15|publisher=Ekstra Bladet|title=Akkari stod til fÃ¦ngsel|url=http://www.ekstrabladet.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=335214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy==
Ahmed Akkari is a co-author of the [[Akkari-Laban dossier]], which played a major role in the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] by bringing the issue to the attention of influential decision-makers in the [[Middle East]].

==Naser Khader threat==
In a documentary published by French television channel [[France 2]] on 23 March 2006, Akkari was recorded - using a [[hidden camera]] - in conversation with Sheikh Raed Hlayhel (who was the head of the delegation to disseminate the &quot;[[Akkari-Laban dossier|Dossier about championing [the cause of] the prophet Muhammad peace be upon him]]&quot;). Akkari made a statement which can be interpreted as an [[implicit]] [[death threat]] against [[Naser Khader]], who is a moderate Muslim and, at the time, a member of the Danish parliament for the [[Det Radikale Venstre|Social Liberal Party]]. According to the footage Akkari said: ''&quot;...If Khader becomes minister of integration, shouldn't someone dispatch two guys to blow up him and his ministry?...&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}} {{cite news|date=2006-03-23|publisher=Danmarks Radio|title=Imam meldt til politiet|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2006/03/23/014126.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2006-03-23|publisher=Reuters|title=Danish police to probe imam's bomb threats|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=2006-03-23T164714Z_01_L2397527_RTRUKOC_0_UK-RELIGION-DENMARK-THREATS.xml&amp;archived=False
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comment was disputed. In the Arabic-French translation, Akkari calls for an attack on the ministry, but in two Arabic-Danish translations, Akkari merely states the possibility of such an attack. TV2's Arabic-Danish translation says ''&quot;...If he (Khader) becomes minister of integration, isn't it possible that a couple (of people) would come to blow up him and his ministry?...&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}} {{cite news|date=2006-03-23|publisher=Politiken|title=Tvivl om imams udtalelser om Khader|url=http://politiken.dk/VisArtikel.iasp?PageID=445000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A fellow party member from Khader's [[political party|party]] [[Elsebeth Gerner Nielsen]] reported Ahmed Akkari to the police. Ahmed Akkari initially denied the statements, but later apologized and stated it was meant as a joke. 

The following day, 24 March 2006, [[Islamisk Trossamfund]] announced that Ahmed Akkari was no longer spokesman for the organization;&lt;ref&gt;{{da icon}} {{cite news|date=2006-03-24|publisher=Danmarks Radio|title=Akkari er ikke lÃ¦ngere talsmand|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/2006/03/24/171252.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akkari denies this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2006-03-26|publisher=Jyllands Posten|title=page 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
