'''''Years''''' is the debut solo album by Years, a solo project by [[Ohad Benchetrit]] of [[Do Make Say Think]] and [[Broken Social Scene]].

''Years'' was born from the wealth of music that Benchetrit had been gathering, but did not belong with his other projects. ''&quot;I basically just wanted to use all of this material that I'd compiled on my hard drive,&quot;'' he says, ''&quot;songs that got started and never finished, or that were parts of other projects and never really got off the ground. So I started trying to finish that [unfinished] record. But in the process, I kept replacing the older songs, one song at a time. About a year later, I'd replaced them all. Years was the album I was left with.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartattack.com/news/69444/years-exorcise-skeletons &quot;Years Exorcise Skeletons&quot;]. ''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]'', May 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Years'' has been described as &quot;the best parts of [[Bell Orchestre]], [[I Am Robot And Proud]] and [[The Hylozoists]], and combines them into a sweeping flurry of instruments&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartattack.com/reviews/69291/years-years Album Review: Years]. ''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]'', May 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Years'' was recently named &quot;record of the year&quot; by [[Jude Rogers]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'', and was described as &quot;quite simply a triumph&quot; by Paul Brown of [[Drowned in Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://drownedinsound.com/releases/14511/reviews/4137366 Album Review: Years]. ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'', July 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
