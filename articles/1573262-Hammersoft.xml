'''Dame Eileen June Atkins''', [[Order of British Empire|DBE]] (born 16 June 1934) is an English actress and occasional [[screenwriter]].

== Early life ==
Atkins was born in the ''Mothers' Hospital'' in [[Lower Clapton|Clapton]], a [[Salvation Army]] women's hostel in [[East End of London|East London]]. Her mother, Annie Ellen ([[married and maiden names|nÃ©e]] Elkins), was a barmaid who was 46 when Eileen was born, and her father, Arthur Thomas Atkins, was a [[gas meter]] reader who was previously under-[[chauffeur]] to the [[Portugal|Portuguese Ambassador]]. Atkins attended [[the Latymer School]], [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]] and the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]].

She was born in the East End, in the Clapton Salvation Army Home. They then moved to Tottenham (something called the White Hart Lane Estate). She described her circumstances then as &quot;pretty well the lowest form of living.&quot; She was the third child in the family and so her family qualified for a council home.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Zucker, ''In The Company of Actors: Reflections on the Craft of Acting'' (London: A &amp; C Black Publishers, 1999), p. 2. Retrieved from Google Books, 3 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her father was an under-chauffeur and her mother worked for a time as a barmaid at the Trocadero Theatre. In her youth she worked really hard to get rid of her cockney accent.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Upstairs Downstairs: BFI Screening&quot; (16 December 2010) in lifeofwylie.com. Retrieved 1 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She is, in fact, against the &quot;fashion&quot; in drama schools these days for students not to get rid of their &quot;basic accent.&quot; She says that such fashion is &quot;bad for those from the working-class areas&quot; as they will never get &quot;classical leading parts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anita Singh, &quot;Dame Eileen Atkins: why must actors have regional accents?&quot;  ''The Telegraph'' (9 December 2010) in www.telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved 1 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother was already nearing 40 when she met her father. Her father was an &quot;under-chauffeur&quot; and serviced the automobile of the Portuguese Ambassador. He did not, in fact, know how to drive and as under-chauffeur was responsible mainly for cleaning the car. Her mother had an abortion on her third pregnancy. An elder sibling of Atkins died at 2 from diphtheria. Her mother regarded this as divine punishment for what she did. At the time Atkins was born her mother was 47, worked in a factory the whole day and then as a barmaid in the Elephant &amp; Castle at night; while the father read gas meters. Her father had in fact &quot;undergone testicular surgery&quot; earlier. She was born in a Salvation Army Home in Clapton, north London. Until she died, her mother insisted that Atkins was born in a hospital, not in a home. When Atkins was three, a Gypsy came to their door selling lucky heather and clothes pegs. She saw Atkins and told the mother the her daughter would be a famous dancer. So her mother enrolled her in dance class. In 1939, she and her 12-year old brother, together with other children, were transported to a rural village in Essex. This was during the War to avoid enemy bombing. She was taken in by a woman, but Atkins was traumatised by this experience. She was later taken back by her mother and her career as &quot;Baby Eileen&quot; began: dancing and singing around the working men's club circuit for 15 shillings a pop. 
When she was 14, going on 15, she saw Robert Atkins' production of ''King John''. She wrote to him saying that the boy who played the prince was not good enough and that she could do better. Robert Atkins wrote back and asked that she come to see him. On the day they met, Robert Atkins thought she was a shop girl, and not a school girl. She gave a little prince speech and Robert Atkins told her to go back when she was grown up. She didn't get into RADA. Guildhall signed her up for a teaching course but &quot;she slipped herself in with the drama students and took up their curriculum as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sally Vincent, &quot;A class act,&quot; ''The Guardian'' (Saturday, 9 December 2000). Retrieved from www.guardian.co.uk on 2 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

She once said: &quot;Despite my screams, I never liked dancing. I studied that from 3 to 15 or 16. During the war I performed at London's Stage Door canteen for American troops. I was Baby Eileen, singing things like 'Yankee Doodle.'&quot; Rev. Michael Burton, one of her grammar school teachers who was &quot;a whiz at dramatics,&quot; detected her potential and &quot;rigorously drilled away her cockney accent.&quot; She studied under him for two years and finally won a scholarship to the Guildhall school of music and drama where she trained as a teacher. After graduation she worked at assorted jobs and was briefly an assistant stage manager at the Oxford Playhouse until Peter Hall fired her for impudence. At 21 she married actor Julian Glover. The marriage continued until 1965.&lt;ref&gt; William Glover, &quot;Eileen Atkins Stars in Another Ringing Triumph,&quot; ''The Evening News'' (Sat., Feb. 26, 1972).

Danced in working men's clubs from age 7 to 15. When she was in panto at 12 in Clapham and Kilburn, someone told her mother that Eileen had a Cockney accent. Her mother was appalled. Speech lessons were too expensive for the family. Fortunately, her divinity teacher in grammar school taught her for free.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Rees, &quot;Theartdesk Q&amp;A: Actress Eileen Atkins,&quot; (Friday, 24 December 2010) in www.theartdesk.com. Retrieved, 3 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From age 7 she tap-danced and sang &quot;incredibly sexy songs&quot; in working men's clubs. She earned fifteen shillings which helped the family budget and paid for her dancing classes. At one time she was attending dance class four or five times a week. A woman took interest in her and paid for her to be educated at Latymer's in Edmonton. By 12 or 13 she was a professional in panto at Clapham and Kilburn. This when her mother wanted her to be rid of the cockney accent. She was sent to a speech-training mistress but this was discontinued because it became too expensive for her family. Then a &quot;bizarre man who used to take us for religious instruction&quot; entered her life. He trained her to speak properly (dropping the accent) and introduced her to Shakespeare. She stayed in Latymer until 16. The teacher came to an agreement with her parents that he would get her a scholarship for one drama school and that if she did not get the scholarship he would arrange for her to do a teaching course in some other drama school. She missed the scholarship to RADA and so entered Guildhall on a teaching course. But while at Guildhall on a teaching course, she attended every drama class. It was not until her third year (when she was teaching once a week) that the principal discovered this. So she was actually doing two courses - teaching and drama - at Guildhall. In her last year she had to teach one day a week. Once she taught children a course on &quot;Free Drama.&quot; She did not like teaching. She was in Guildhall in the &quot;early '50s&quot; (p. 4). She hanged around two seasons for Stratford. When she went there she was not even allowed to understudy. She just went as the wife of Julian Glover, her then husband. She really learned about acting in Stratford. Before Stratford, she did &quot;a few seasons of weekly rep in dreadful places.&quot; She and Julian were in a rep together in a holiday camp in Skegness. They were both then 21 when they got married. Then Julian got a walk-on job at Stratford. She &quot;gradually went up the scale at Stratford:&quot; from being an usherette to finally acting on stage.&lt;ref&gt;Carole Zucker, ''In The Company of Actors: Reflections on the Craft of Acting'' (London: A &amp; C Black Publishers, 1999), pp. 2-5.

Attended Latymer's Grammar School - ca. 1945 - 1950 (when she turned 16 on 16 June 1950). She was certainly in Latymer's when she was 12 or 13 (1946/1947) and 14 or 15 (1948/1949). Entered Guildhall on teaching course - ca. September 1950 (aged 16). She was at Guildhall for (at least) three years (on teaching course but also attended drama courses) - graduated ca. 1953. 1950-1953 would certainly be &quot;early '50s.&quot; As soon as she left Guildhall she got her first job with Robert Atkins. First job with Robert Atkins: in 1953 as Jaquenetta in ''Love's Labours Lost'' at the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre with Robert Atkins directing. In an interview with Carole Zucker in October 1997, she said: &quot;I went nine years before I was working steadily.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carole Zucker, ''In The Company of Actors: Reflections on the Craft of Acting'' (London: A &amp; C Black Publishers, 1999), p. 5. Retrieved in Google Books,3 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;nine years&quot; was probably from 1953 to 1962. In 1962, then with the Old Vic, she began getting steady stage roles and even appeared in theatre magazines. Married Julian Glover when both were 21: she turned 21 on 16 June 1955 and he turned 21 on 27 March 1956, so they were probably married April/May 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Reconstructed based on data from: (1) Carole Zucker, ''In The Company of Actors: Reflections on the Craft of Acting'' (London: A &amp; C Publishers, 1999); (2) Richard Digby Day, &quot;Delightful insight into life of actress,&quot; ''Newark Advertiser'' (Sunday, 23 October 2011 - Palace Theatre, Newark) in www.newarkadvertiser.co.uk; (3) &quot;Regent's Park Open Air Theatre: Our History&quot; in openairtheatre.org/history; (4) Production Notes of ''The Queen of Sheba's Pears, Last Chance Harvey'' and ''Robin Hood''; and (5)&quot;Atkins, Eileen 1934 -   &quot; in ''Contemporary Theatre, Film and Television'' (The Gale Group, Inc., 2004) retrieved in www.encyclopedia.com on 4 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother was told by a [[Romani people|gypsy]] that Eileen would be a great dancer, so she was sent to dancing classes from an early age, and appeared dancing in [[working men's club]]s as &quot;Baby Eileen&quot; throughout the war years.&lt;ref&gt;interview with [[Jonathan Ross]] on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, BBC1, 13 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

She took dancing lessons when a gypsy came to her mother's door and said that she would be a good dancer. She danced in working men's clubs two to three nights a week. By 12 she hated dancing and began doing pantomine acting. Out of 300 applicants for a RADA scholarship, she got down to the last three but was not selected. So she did a three-year course on teaching and acting at the Guildhall instead. As soon as she left she got her first job with Robert Atkins whom she impressed back when she was 12. She met her first husband, Julian Glover, when he was doing repertory at Butlins  and he helped her enter the Royal Shakespeare Company.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Digby Day, &quot;Delightful Insight Into Life of Actress,&quot; ''Newark Advertiser'' (Sunday, 23 October 2011 - Palace Theatre, Newark) in www.newarkadvertiser.co.uk.

She was taken to see ''King John'' at the Open Air Theatre in Regents Park when she was 12. She wrote to Robert Atkins, then director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, saying that the boy who played Prince Arthur was bad and that she would have been better. They met, she did a Prince Arthur speech and he told her to come back when an adult. She won the Shakespeare prize at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Eileen Atkins&quot; in The Telegraph (16 June 2001) at www.telegraph.co.uk.

On her early years as an actress and Stratford: &quot;I went nine years before I was working steadily. It took me so long to get going, hanging around for two seasons at Stratford. When I first went there, they wouldn't even allow me to understudy. I just went as the wife of my then-husband, Julian Glover. I really started to learn about acting at Stratford. I'd done a few seasons of weekly rep in dreadful places, and then I married Julian. We'd been in rep together in a holiday camp in Skegness, and we were both 21. Then he'd got a walk-on job at Stratford . . . So he got into Stratford, and I'd given up by then: I had two terrible years, with only a few weeks of rep here and there, and I thought 'Well, I'll just go up and be a wife'. I gradually went up the scale at Stratford: I worked as an usherette, and then they asked me if I'd like to work on the postcard stand in the foyer, and I sold postcards of all the old actors, and answered questions about the theatre. I was so miserable. I so wanted to be backstage with the actors. That season, suddenly, they'd lost about five people, and they were thinning on the ranks of the walk-ons because everybody had moved up. My husband heard they were going to take on some more extras for a crowd scene, and he went to Glen Byam Shaw and said 'Look, my wife's here with me, and she's dying to be in it', and he said 'Listen old chap, we don't just take people's wives, because you want.' and my husband said 'I think she did an audition for you once.' He looked up my audition, and he said 'All right, she can come into the company, but she will not even be allowed to understudy. Okay?' I was allowed in the company. The thrill! I went in halfway through the season. And I'd only been there six weeks, and the girl who was playing Audrey in ''As You Like It'' - Dame Peggy Ashcroft was playing Rosalind - was taken to hospital for six weeks. Then ''her'' understudy was taken to hospital in the night with some kind of chest thing, she couldn't breath. And I thought 'She's the understudy, who is going to play Audrey tomorrow night? What if she's not better? So I stayed up all night and learned Audrey, and made sure I was in the theatre the next day, and they were all saying 'Oh my God, is there anyone who knows Audrey?' and I said 'Yes, I know it, I've played it.' I lied, and I went on as Audrey, and from then on they accepted me at Stratford. But you see, I was cunning.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;Carole Zucker, In ''The Company of Actors: Reflections on the Craft of Acting'' (London: A &amp; C Black Publishers, 1999), p.5-6.

Her debut was in 1966, in [[Frank Marcus]]' ''[[The Killing of Sister George]]''. Next was the Russian play ''[[The Promise (1965 play)|The Promise]]'' (which closed after less than a month in 1967). In 1972's premiere of [[Robert Bolt]]'s ''Vivat! Vivat Regina!'', she played Elizabeth I to [[Claire Bloom]]'s [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].

Later in 2008, she appeared at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]] in ''[[The Female of the Species (play)|The Female of the Species]]'', a play which outraged the feminist [[Germaine Greer]] because of its connection with an incident in her life. The play was, however, generally very well received, with ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reviewer Tim Walker giving it five stars and describing it as &quot;great theatre.&quot;
