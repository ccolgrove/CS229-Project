'''Montebello'''  is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]], in the southwestern part of the [[San Gabriel Valley]]. It is located on {{convert|8.4|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land just {{convert|8|mi|abbr=on}} east of downtown Los Angeles. It is considered part of the [[Gateway Cities]], and the city is a member of the Gateway Cities Council of Governments. The name, Montebello, means âBeautiful mountainâ in both Italian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/monte&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spanishdict.com/translate/bello&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 20th century, Montebello was a well-known source for oil reserves.  The population was 62,500 at the 2010 census; according to the [[California Department of Finance]], the estimated population of Montebello on January 1, 2011, was 62,789.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-1/documents/E-1_2011_Press_Release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the arrival of the [[Spain|Spaniards]], the land along the [[Rio Hondo (California)|Rio Hondo River]] was populated by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] (Gabrielino) part of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] family [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The Tongva occupied much of the Los Angeles basin and the islands of [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina]], [[San Nicolas Island|San Nicolas]], [[San Clemente Island|San Clemente]] and [[Santa Barbara Island|Santa Barbara]]. When the Spanish explorer [[Juan Rodrigues Cabrillo]] arrived off the shores of Santa Catalina, the Tongva came out in their canoes to meet with him in 1542. The language of the Tongva was different from the neighboring Indian tribes and it was called Gabrielino by the Spanish.  The Gabrielinos lived in dome-like structures with thatched exteriors.  Both sexes wore long hair styles and tattooed their bodies.  During warm weather the men wore little clothing, but the women would wear minimal skirts made of animal hides.  During the cold weather they would wear animal skin capes.  European diseases killed many of the Tongva and by 1870 the area had few remaining native inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fred&quot;&gt;[http://www.datarecoverypomona.com/data-recovery-montebello.html Data Recovery Montebello California (CA) - Data Retrieval Montebello California (CA) - Data Restoration Montebello California (CA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Franciscan Missionaries, Fathers Angel Somera and Pedro Cambon, founded the original [[Mission San Gabriel Arcangel]] on September 8, 1771 near where San Gabriel Boulevard intersects the Rio Hondo River. Additionally, it is also close to the present day Sanchez Adobe Mansion.  This marked the beginning of the Los Angeles region's settlement by Spaniards.  The San Gabriel Mission is the fourth of twenty-one &lt;ref name=&quot;cityofmontebello1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmontebello.com/about/history_/default.asp |title=History |publisher=City of Montebello |date=1920-10-19 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; missions that would ultimately be established along California's [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]. The San Gabriel mission did well as a cattle ranch and farm, but six years after its founding a destructive flood led the mission fathers to relocate the establishment to its current location farther north in present day city of [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]]. The original mission site is now marked by a [[California Historical Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Los Angeles | work =California Historical Landmarks  | publisher =California Department of Parks &amp; Recreation Office of Historic Preservation | year =2004 | url =http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=21427 | accessdate =2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of the mission, the region operated under a Rancho system.  The lands which now compose the city of Montebello were originally parts of [[Rancho San Antonio (Lugo)|Rancho San Antonio]], [[Rancho La Merced]], and [[Rancho Paso de Bartolo]]. The Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe, built in 1844, still stands at the center of old Rancho La Merced in East Montebello. Recently restored, is the city's oldest structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofmontebello.com/about/history_/default.asp City of Montebello - History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel]] took place in Montebello on January 8, 1847. This battle that gave the control of Los Angeles and Alta California to the United States, and was an important decisive factor in  winning the [[Mexican-American war]].  Today the site is California State Historical Landmark #385, and there are two old cannons and a plaque commemorating the battle overlooking the river on Bluff Rd. and Washington Blvd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Bauer, K. Jack  | title=The Mexican War, 1846â1848 | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1974 | isbn=0-8032-6107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[American Civil War]], some {{convert|5000|acre|abbr=on}} of the [[East Los Angeles (region)|East Los Angeles region]] was owned by an Italian settler from [[Genoa]], Alessandro Repetto. After Repetto's death in 1885, his brother sold his rancho to  a consortium of five Los Angeles businessmen including banker [[Isaias Hellman]] and wholesale grocer/historian [[Harris Newmark]] for $60,000, or about $12 per acre.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofmontebello1&quot;/&gt;

Later the land was divided among the partners, one large parcel of approximately {{convert|2000|acre|abbr=on}} going to a partnership of Newmark and his nephew, banker Kaspare Cohn. It was out of the Newmark and Cohn share of {{convert|1200|acre|abbr=on}} that Montebello had its beginnings in May 1899.  After seeking the advice of [[hydraulic engineer]] [[William Mulholland]] in drafting the design and building a water system,  the land was subdivided.  In 1900 the completed water system was incorporated as the Montebello Land and Water Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Sixty years in Southern California, 1853â1913, containing the reminiscences of Harris Newmark | work =American Memory | publisher =Library of Congress | url =http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/calbk:@field(DOCID+@lit(calbk023div45)) | accessdate =2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An area of {{convert|200|acre|abbr=on}}, adjacent to the tracks of the [[Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad|San Pedro, Los Angeles &amp; Salt Lake Railroad]] (now part of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]) were developed into a townsite called Newmark, and the remainder of the land was subdivided into {{convert|5|acre|abbr=on}} lots suitable for small-scale agriculture. On Mulholland's suggestion, Montebello, was adopted as the city's name, replacing the original name Newmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Rasmussen | first =Cecilia | title =City names stem from trees, ranches - even a goddess | work =Los Angeles Times | pages =B2 | date =July 29, 2007 | accessdate =2007-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name, Montebello, which means ''beautiful mountain'' in both Italian and Spanish, is shared with several other communities in Europe and the Americas.

Originally an agricultural community in the early 20th century, Montebello was known for its prolific production of flowers, berries, fruits, and vegetables.  The first flower show was sponsored by the Montebello Womanâs Club and held in the [[Montebello High School]] auditorium on Whittier Boulevard in 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofmontebello1&quot;/&gt;  The Montebello â El Carmel (South Montebello) Improvement Association, the predecessor of the Montebello Chamber of Commerce, operated from September 1907 to April 1912. Its purpose was âto improve and beautify the community.â Some of its achievements were: Whittier Boulevard was paved, trees planted along the streets, laid the groundwork and established the first high school,  strived to have the name of Newmark dropped and to have the entire area incorporated as the City of Montebello.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montebellochamber.org/History.aspx |title=Chamber History |publisher=Montebellochamber.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 19, 1920, the city's name was officially changed to Montebello and it was incorporated as the 35th of the present cities in Los Angeles County, and the official seal contained a red poinsettia in the center.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofmontebello1&quot;/&gt;

The [[Standard Oil Company]] discovered oil in the Montebello hills in 1917, on the [[Baldwin]] and Temple properties.  This discovery revolutionized the face of Montebello. The formerly agricultural hills became oil fields, and were eventually producing one-eighth of California's crude oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTB1&quot;/&gt; For sixty years, the Montebello hills were dotted with nodding oil wells.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofmontebello1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mkhs.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=62613&amp;type=d&lt;/ref&gt;

::(Script is also is Armenian).''  ''The Annual Armenian Food Fair is  hosted in May every year at Holy Cross Cathedral in Montebello.''
Montebello was also home to a significant Japanese community. The city's Japanese residents operated the four nurseries in town, but were sent to internment camps during [[World War II]].  Japanese-Peruvian and Japanese-Hawaiian communities later settled in the area after WWII.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fred&quot;/&gt; When the Japanese citizens returned from the internment camps after the war, most found they had lost their property.  One of the nurseries had been taken over and cared for by a loyal employee, a young French-American, named Fred Sarrazin.&lt;ref name=fred&gt;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/23500751/Sending-Flowers-to-America&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war, he returned the nursery to its rightful owner, George Mori.  In turn, Mr. Mori gave Sarrazin employment at the nursery for his lifetime, and the Mori Nursery was able to continue under its original name.&lt;ref name=fred/&gt; Today, the Japanese population in Montebello is over 11% of the total population.&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofmontebello1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTB1&quot;/&gt;

A mile-long length of street costs $1.6 million.&quot; &quot;How much does a bus cost? $560,000, but its value becomes $5,000 once theyâre done with it later, after many years of service.&quot;  &quot;How many of the city's ancient computers need to be replaced?  Last year, the city laid off 26 employees, and closed a fire station. In light of the scandals happening in nearby cities in Southern California, Councilman Frank Gomez immediately asked the onerous question: &quot;Has the city been mis-managed for the last quarter century?â &lt;ref&gt;http://egpnews.com/?p=17636&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
Avoiding a definite answer, Randy Narramore replied, âI donât think itâs one thing. Itâs been happening for a number of years, the city âcannot keep borrowingâ.  Narramore stated that  âOvertime is a major issue.&quot;  He then posted a chart that demonstrated that fire and police personnel are sometimes getting as much in overtime and benefits, as they do in salaries, i.e., there was one captain that received more in overtime, $105,000, than he did in salary, $91,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egpnews.com/?p=17636 |title=Montebello Budget Crisis Likely to Affect Police, Fire : Eastern Group Publications |publisher=Egpnews.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing funds===	
In addition to the shortfall, there is the mystery of how the city of Montebello has misplaced the records explaining the fate of more than $1 million that were sitting in some of &quot;off-the-books&quot; accounts.  City officials said that only $5,000 was left in an &quot;off-the-books&quot; Union Bank  account that had once had about $900,000.  The discovery was made shortly after an unofficial city account that held $240,000 was discovered at Banco Popular.  An investigation will be handled by the District Attorney's public integrity unit.
&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate.com&quot;/&gt;  &lt;ref name=Whit&gt;http://www.whittierdailynews.com/ci_17444887&lt;/ref&gt;

Prosecutors in Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley's Public Integrity Division  said they are in the process of examining what happened with those funds.  Furthermore, the federal [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] has told Montebello to return more than $1.3 million that HUD says was improperly spent.
&lt;ref name=&quot;funds&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/montebello-city-manager-abruptly-resigns-amid-fiscal-crisis.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+lanowblog+%28L.A.+Now%29 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=L.A. Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;	The city has also been sued by a businessman who claims it  borrowed up to $19 million in unsanctioned funds from its redevelopment agency in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/19/local/la-me-montebello-20110219 | work=Los Angeles Times | first1=Jessica | last1=Garrison | first2=Richard | last2=Winton | date=2011-02-19 | title=Fiscal mess fuels crisis in Montebello}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the DA's office stepped in, the City Attorney, former City Administrator Richard Torres, members of the City Council, and [[Union Bank]], where the biggest mystery account had been held, have offered little or no explanation or had shown any signs of an investigation. City officials have said they have no idea why the accounts weren't on the Montebello's books or where the money had gone.  Former seven-time mayor and current councilman Bill Molinari stated he thinks an accounting from the city will be forthcoming shortly. &quot;Most likely the Union Bank fund was a Money market account, which held redevelopment funds that were drawing interest in line with state law,&quot; Molinari said. Commenting further, he said, &quot;Quite frankly, there's nothing going on over here, that's the gospel truth.&quot; &lt;ref name=Whit/&gt;

Two weeks after Interim City Manager Peter Cosentini warned council members that they needed to take &quot;immediate corrective action&quot; and need to call a special meeting or the city would not be able to make payroll or pay its bills by the end of the year.  &quot;We need to move quickly because clearly the wall is in front of us,&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.topix.com/city/montebello-ca/2011/04/montebello-weighs-fee-and-tax-increase-to-deal-with-looming-fiscal-crisis&lt;/ref&gt;  Interim City Administrator Peter Cosentini said. &quot;It is in view.&quot;  Cosentini was ignored and resigned effective immediately. He stated that he was stepping down because he was &quot;no longer comfortable with our progress toward a balanced budget.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;funds&quot;/&gt;

==Education==
The city is served by the [[Montebello Unified School District]]. M.U.S.D. serves the city of Montebello, portions of the cities of Bell Gardens, Commerce, Downey, Rosemead, Pico Rivera, and Monterey Park, as well as the unincorporated community of South San Gabriel, and a part of the unincorporated community of East Los Angeles.  The District is one of the largest and most diverse in Los Angeles County with an enrollment of more than 35,000 Kâ12 students and 30,000 adults enrolled in Adult Education.  There are eighteen elementary schools, six intermediate schools, four high schools,  and four adult schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montebello.k12.ca.us/schools/default.htm |title=Montebello Unified School District &amp;#124; Schools |publisher=Montebello.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four high schools in the [[Montebello Unified School District]] are the historic [[Montebello High School]], founded in 1909,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mhs.montebello.k12.ca.us/ |title=Montebello High School &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Mhs.montebello.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bell Gardens High School]], [[Schurr High School]] and [[Vail High School]], an [[alternative high school]] (grades 10â12).

Saint Benedict School, a private parochial grammar school, K-8, is operated on Saint Benedict Church property. It opened in September 1941 and was formally dedicated on Pearl Harbor Day, December 7, 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-benedict.com/ Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A private parochial high school, [[Cantwell-Sacred Heart of Mary High School]], is  also located in Montebello. Originally two separate gender-segregated High Schools, they merged in the 1991, the Sacred Heart of Mary campus moving to the Cantwell campus.  This monumental endeavor has taken and incorporated the very best from each of the these two educational traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshm.org/a_ourhistory.html |title=History of CSHM |publisher=Cshm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New high school===
A $30 million high school, Applied Technology Center is scheduled to open in Fall, 2011. The new facility will offer high school students college-focused instruction with state-of-the-art technical training. Located on the corner of Mines and Maple avenues, the campus will open to 720 students.  &quot;It's an integrated education, with all the classes related to an academic academy,&quot; an official said.  The campus can accommodate 750 students, all of whom had to apply to qualify to attend the new technical school.&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;&gt;http://www.whittierdailynews.com/ci_17386593?source=rss_viewed&lt;/ref&gt;

Board of education President Edwin Chau said the ATC will offer students a &quot;rigorous academic curriculum and career technical education within a full-day schedule.&quot;  At Montebello Unified, we have made it our goal to ensure our students graduate from our district career-ready and college prepared,&quot; Chau said. &quot;The new Applied Technology Center is truly taking our efforts to the next level.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;
The project is being paid for with a $98 million Measure M bond, which voters passed in November 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;/&gt;
