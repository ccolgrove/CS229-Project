They were first developed in July 2003 and were released in the market in the third quarter of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Motorola embraces the ethos of cool |work = [[MSNBC]] |date=  2006-04-11 |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7432916/page/2/ |font=&lt;&quot;14&quot;&gt; |accessdate = 2006-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its striking appearance and thin profile, it was initially marketed as an exclusive fashion phone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = German |first = Kent |title = Razr refresh: Motorola's fashion cell phones |work = [[CNET]] |pages = 3 |date=  2005-11-09 |url = http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-3504_7-5670915-1.html |accessdate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; but within a year, its price was lowered and it was wildly successful, selling over 50 million units by July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease | url=http://www.motorola.com/mediacenter/news/detail.jsp?globalObjectId=7031_6980_23 | title=Motorola Ships 50 Millionth MOTORAZR | date=18 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the RAZR's four-year run, Motorola sold more than 130 million units, becoming the best-selling clamshell phone in the world (and is still today).

The RAZR series was marketed until July 2007, when the succeeding [[Motorola RAZR 2]] series was released. Marketed as a more sleek and more stable design of the RAZR, the RAZR 2 included more features, improved telephone audio quality, and a touch sensitive external screen.  The new models were the V8, the V9, and the V9m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Ziegler |first = Chris |title = The Motorola Razr 2 | work=[[Engadget]] Mobile |date=  2007-05-15 |url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/15/the-motorola-razr-2/ |accessdate = 2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the RAZR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sales were only half of the original in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phonemag.com/iphone-sales-rocking-and-eating-razr2s-lunch-at-the-same-time-01320.php iPhone sales rocking and eating RAZR2's lunch at the same time]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''V3''' was released in Q3 2004. The team of the V3 put together a number of design choices that set the device apart from the competition. The phone had the thinnest profile at the time on a clamshell set, sported an electroluminescent keypad made out of a single metal wafer and used an industry standard mini USB port for data, battery charger and headphones, all in an aluminum body with an external glass screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/31/magazines/fortune/razr_greatteams_fortune/index.htm | work=CNN | date=2006-05-31 | accessdate=2010-05-13 | title=RAZR'S edge | first=Adam | last=Lashinsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints were made about dust accumulating between the V3's plastic screen and LCD glass, possibly through an external side button.  Access to the dust requires peeling off the plastic cover, usually followed by a replacement cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themotoguide.com/cleaningtheinnerlcd.php |title=Modding the Motorola Razr V3 &amp;#124; razr mods &amp;#124; Razr Software Upgrading&amp;nbsp;â Cleaning the Dust from the LCD |publisher=Themotoguide.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matte Black version===
A black version was produced for distribution in the [[77th Academy Awards]] gift bags,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2006-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released in early May 2005. While distribution was initially limited to specific carriers in North America, the black V3 was widely available elsewhere.

===Hot Pink versions===
The first pink version was released in October 2005, and as of June 2006, was available in the USA from T-Mobile (as RAZR V3 Magenta, after the [[T-Mobile]]âand its parent, [[Deutsche Telekom]]'sâcorporate color, but called RAZR V3 Pink in other countries, including other T-Mobile networks), Verizon, Cingular Wireless, [[Suncom Wireless]], Cellular One from Dobson Cellular Systems (each in a different shade). It was available in Canada from Bell, Rogers Wireless and Telus, and in the United Kingdom from T-Mobile and the [[Carphone Warehouse]]. $25 of sales from the Rogers pink V3 went to Rethink Breast Cancer.  It was also available in all [[Movistar]]-serviced countries and [[Claro Americas|Claro]] ([[Telcel]]).

===Miami Ink Collection===
As of 30 October 2006 through [[T-Mobile]] in the United States, [[Motorola]] offered a version with laser-etched [[tattoo]]-inspired designs created by [[Ami James]] of the [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] [[reality television]] show, [[Miami Ink]]. The phones  are standard V3r's,but aesthetically different because of the tattoo design on the phone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=171/ MOTORAZR V3 Miami Ink Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

===MS500===
Another version of this phone was released in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) on 1 June 2005. This version has the similar physical appearance as the original V3 but instead of GSM, it is a CDMA phone for [[SK Telecom]]. It is the first CDMA version of the RAZR without the expandable memory, Bluetooth and SIM card, since Motorola Korea's system was able to produce its own model before worldwide [[GSM]] format release. It has a 1.3 megapixel camera, video recording, 80MB of internal memory and a variety of UI features, such as mobile blog, Yoga graphic book, Diet diary and [[lottery]] number generator for Wellness theme. It also comes in colors other than those mentioned above. Black, pink, and lime models are seen around Korea. In 8 February 2006 [[Motorola]] [[Korea]] released its own slide-phone model for the RAZR named Z model name MS600.  Unlike most other versions, the MS500 version is packaged with a charging dock and has three metal terminals on the back side immediately under the battery cover.

Also, as the add-on to the MS600, MS500 Lime RAZR has been in circulation in South Korea since October 2006 along with the Motorola KRZR Black and [[Motorola KRZR]] Fire (Red).

===V3re===
The RAZR V3re (also known as V3_06) is a GSM model that has been updated to support EDGE and Crystal Talk technology. It is nearly identical to the original V3, having no memory card slot and with a VGA 4x zoom camera. It can be identified by a slightly larger notch under the Motorola logo when closed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hacktherazr.com/forum/about-v3re |title=About the V3re |publisher=Hack The Razr |date= |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; a black matte Motorola logo in the battery cover instead the metallic silver logo in the V3 and a software version starting with R3442A. It is available in North America from T-Mobile, AT&amp;T in the US, Rogers/Fido in Canada and Vivo in Brazil (using both 850&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz. This one with the old-named Telemig Celular, a Vivo company) It is also available in three colors; Orchid Pink, Silver, and Stone Grey. Contents in the box include quick start manuals and it's charger.

==V3r/V3t==
The V3r and V3t are models sold by [[T-Mobile]], [[Cingular Wireless|AT&amp;T (formerly Cingular)]], and Canadian cellular services such as Rogers Wireless. These models are virtually identical to the V3 and V3i, except they use [[Motorola]]'s Digital Audio Player instead of iTunes for music playback. T-Mobile's V3r offers a Voice Notes feature which permits forwarding your audio recordings to voicemail as the only storage method. However, a publicly available [[Serially Electrically Erasable Memory|SEEM]] edit permits users to enable the hidden Voice Records feature. Voice Records allows you to save voice recordings locally to phone memory. Currently, Voice Records is limited to less than two minutes of audio recording and stores the resulting records as .avr format files on the a partition within phone memory. In contrast, currently available SEEM edits can expand the maximum size of video recordings.

T-Mobile V3t phone memory is 10.0MB total, including all system files. This space is divided unevenly into a and c partitions. Memory on partition a is larger than 2MB and contains system files, including some of the branding images for the phone carrier. Partition a also contains the avr structure for the hidden Voice Records feature. Partition c is larger than 5.5MB and stores user data, including images, sounds, videos, text notes, calendar entries, phone book entries, Java applets and web cache. V3r and V3t phones sold by T-Mobile come equipped with Java-based software that supports T-Mobile's &quot;MyFaves&quot; rate plan. Publicly available third party tools can remove this Java software and other system or locked files to free memory for other uses.

Canada's Rogers Wireless also carries them for a reduced price compared to the original Razrs.

The '''V3i''' was announced in November 2005, and addresses some of the faults of the original RAZR V3 including a better (1.23 megapixel) camera with 8x digital zoom, an improved external and internal display also support for [[microSD]] cards of up to 1[[Gigabyte|GB]]. V3i is functionally very close to [[Motorola]] [[V635]] model. The V3i comes in two versions: one with iTunes and one with Motorola's Digital Audio Player (DAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Motorola]] | title = Motorola RAZR V3i | year = 2006 | url = http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=130 | accessdate = 2007-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iTunes]] version of the phone has a 50 or 100 song limit restriction (&quot;cap&quot;) depending on where the phone model was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The phone's looks have also been subtly changed. It was announced on 8 December 2005 that Motorola had teamed up with [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] to produce a Special Edition Gold RAZR V3t. Only 1,000 of these have been made and sold for a premium price.

On 1 June 2006, Motorola and Dolce &amp; Gabbana once again released their limited edition gold phone. This model includes a D&amp;G cell phone holder, a signature leather pouch, [[Bluetooth]] headphone, and FM earphones. It is available from all major [[Motorola]] retailers and select D&amp;G boutiques.

The V3i is available in the following colors:
* Silver Quartz (main color)
* Gunmetal Grey
* Gold Plate (special edition DG version only, see above)
* Dark Blue
* Maroon
* Violet
* Orchid
* Black for (PRODUCT)&lt;sup&gt;RED&lt;/sup&gt; (special edition to tie in with the [[(PRODUCT) RED]] initiative)
* Platinum
* Red
* Chrome Green
* Chrome Purple
* Celery (some companies call it Lime Green instead)
The [[Motorola]] RAZR V3i was released to most worldwide markets in the Q4 of 2005â2006. In the U.S. the phone was released through Cingular Wireless on 6 September 2006, with a new activation price of $299, while T-Mobile released the Dolce &amp; Gabbana V3i exclusively in the United States.

==V3c==
On 21 November 2005, a [[CDMA2000]] version of the RAZR, known as the RAZR V3c, became available to Alltel and SaskTel users. [[Verizon Wireless]] followed suit on 7 December 2005. Unlike models for Alltel and other carriers, Verizon's V3c features a proprietary user interface and disables, in software, Bluetooth file transfer capabilities (called [[OBEX]]). (Although OBEX is supported in Verizon's V3c firmware version .02, and version .04 if flash-upgraded directly from .02, skipping any install of .03.) 

In January 2006, Canadian [[Telus]], [[Bell Mobility]] and [[Aliant Mobility]], Venezuelan carriers [[Movistar]] and [[CANTV|Movilnet]], and Brazilian [[Vivo (mobile phone network)|Vivo]] began carrying the V3c. In April 2006 [[Cricket Communications]] began selling the V3c.  The handset was also made available for Metro PCS.  The RAZR V3c supports CDMA 2000 1xRTT and 1xEV-DO third generation wireless technologies. This is the technology Verizon Wireless uses to provide their [[V CAST]] multimedia service.

The coverage of this feature, however, may not be available everywhere. [[US Cellular]] and [[Alaska Communications Systems]], Alaska's CDMA provider, also carry the V3c. It also has approximately 41.2 MB of internal memory, although only about 36 MB are available for use. The V3c does not support expansion with a memory card.

The original version of the V3c was charcoal gray, and a light pink version called Satin Pink (different from the GSM Magenta/Pink and the [[AT&amp;T]] Cotton Candy versions) was released by Verizon Wireless in January 2006. Telus Mobility, Bell, Aliant, and Vivo also carry pink versions of the V3c.

==V3m==
V3m is a [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] version of the RAZR. As an upgrade to the V3c, it features a [[microSD]] card slot for up to 2 [[Gigabytes|GB]] of memory expansion, a longer lasting battery, and 40MB of internal memory. The V3m came in silver, pink and red although the original release as well as models that used to be available on the Sprint CDMA network featured the gunmetal gray color of the V3c.  For a limited time Alltel and US Cellular offered a Fire Red color.  This model is not available in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] as they use GSM, not CDMA, although the [[Motorola RAZR V3x|V3x]] is on sale there.

Due to many Sprint customers complaining about less than expected battery life, Motorola offered free high-capacity batteries to Sprint customers who contact Motorola's customer service line with battery life issues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

===Verizon Wireless version===
[[File:Razor2000ppx.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Verizon Wireless version of the RAZR]]
[[Verizon Wireless]] disabled certain features on the V3m including the ability to transfer data files to and from the phone via [[Bluetooth]] (a specific protocol called [[OBEX]]). [[Verizon]] has also blocked the transfer of most data over [[USB]], such as ringtones. These phones also run [[Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless]] (BREW), which signs each application to the phones [[Electronic Serial Number]], or ESN, thus preventing the use of free applications. The equivalent models offered by competitors (such as the V3t by [[T-Mobile]]) still retain these features.

The V3m on [[Verizon]] will play .WMA formatted music files placed in the my_music directory of the removable memory chip, but although the telephone with accept a 2 GB memory chip, only a portion ( ~ 600 Mbytes) can be accessed by the music player.  Stereo headphone playback can be achieved with a miniature USB to 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm phone jack adapter containing the appropriate interface circuitry; adapters designed for hands-free handset operation may not work.

[[Verizon]] also installs their own user interface instead of the default [[Motorola]] interface that they used to use in the past. This has led to many [[Verizon Wireless]] users to resort to using their own artificial means of reverting their phones back to an original [[Motorola]] condition, or to that of a Verizon phone that has some of the disabled features enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mark.cdmaforums.com/Monster2.htm |title=Mark_Venture's Verizon Phone Info Page |publisher=Mark.cdmaforums.com |date=2007-06-05 |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newer Verizon version of the phone has been upgraded and features limitless video capture, easier laid out menu system and the ability to customize the external screen. The phone is still unable to sync to a computer via USB cable for anything other than charging, unless a software such as [[Bitpim]] is used to access files.

===Red V3m===
Partnering with Motorola, US Cellular and Sprint released a special [[Product Red]] RAZR and [[Bluetooth]] H500 headset to help support [[Global Fund]] programs which positively impact the lives of women and children affected by [[HIV/AIDS]] in [[Africa]]. Also in the UK there is a [[Product Red]] V3i, SLVR, and [[Bluetooth]] H3 headset.

==VE20==
The RAZR VE20 is the newest CDMA model of RAZR. It takes the features of the RAZRÂ² V9m and makes it more affordable for consumers. Its rounded clamshell body is almost as thin as the RAZR V3m. it features a QVGA main display, outer display with virtual touch keys, 2 megapixel camera, stereo Bluetooth, and a microSD memory card slot up to 8Gb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Announced in March 2005, the '''V3x''' was formerly known as the [[Motorola V1150]]. Externally, it appears to be a larger V3, albeit with enhancements such as a 2.0 Megapixel camera. Internally, it is quite different, utilizing a different microprocessor, chipset, an [[Nvidia]] GoForce 4200 GPU, and radio ICs. As a 3G product, its feature set is closer to that of phones such as the [[Motorola V980]], e.g., two cameras instead of the single camera typical on GSM or CDMA products.

However one of the main attractions of the RAZR V3, the fact that it is very thin, is no longer present in the V3x; although it is the smallest phone available in the UK on the &quot;[[Hutchinson 3G|3]]&quot; network, compared to other clamshells, it is only an average-sized phone. It won the &quot;Best 3GSM handset&quot; at the 2006 [[3GSM World Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asia.cnet.com/reviews/mobilephones/ontheradar/0,39050922,39311054,00.htm |title=Motorola's RAZR V3x gets &quot;Best 3GSM Handset&quot; award&amp;nbsp;â Mobile Phones&amp;nbsp;â Crave&amp;nbsp;â CNET Asia |publisher=Asia.cnet.com |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===M702iG===
In [[Japan]], a 3G(W-CDMA) [[NTT DoCoMo]] version of the V3x was released in late August 2006. This version has [[IrDA]].
{{-}}

==V3xx==
Announced in July 2006, the V3xx is a 3G Category 5/6 (3.6 Mbit/s) [[HSDPA]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] supported handset. It is extremely similar in appearance to the compact V3i design, but incorporates an improved feature set with a 1.3 megapixel camera in place of the 1.23 megapixel, 50 MB of internal memory, support for [[microSD]] and [[Bluetooth]] [[Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|A2DP]]. Like the V3x, it is also equipped with a secondary screen and a higher resolution 240x320 pixel ([[Quarter VGA|QVGA]]) main screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Motorola RAZR V3xx | work = GSM Arena | date=  2006-12-20 | url = http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_v3xx-1648.php | accessdate = 2006-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The V3xx was made available for purchase internationally on the [[3 (telecommunication)|Three]] network in November 2006, and is now available on AT&amp;T (formerly Cingular) for free with a new 2-year contract. The secondary camera is not available in the USA.  The built-in [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], manufactured by [[Nvidia]] (model [[GoForce]] 4800) is capable of rendering 3D images through [[OpenGL ES]]. The phone includes a much faster CPU as well, making the performance of all features, including 3G/Data much more real-time. Menuing delays common to the slower V3 platform are gone. With the new CPU, the V3xx Phone also includes a fast USB V2.0 for rapid ringtone/image/mp3 file downloading. Older V3's were limited to USB V1.1.

Unlike with the V3 and V3i which were both quad band GSM, and thus worked equally well on any GSM network in the world, the V3xx comes in different variants depending on the local frequency bands used for GSM and UMTS/HSDPA. The North American V3xx is Tri band (850&amp;nbsp;MHz/1800&amp;nbsp;MHz/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz) GSM and dual band  (850&amp;nbsp;MHz/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz) UMTS/HSDPA, whereas the version sold in Europe and Asia is tri band (900&amp;nbsp;MHz/1800&amp;nbsp;MHz/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz) GSM and single band (2.1&amp;nbsp;GHz) UMTS/HSDPA. This is likely due to the need to fit the internal components of the V3xx into a small casing; as of early 2007 global phones that support quad-band GSM and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA are considerably bulkier than the V3xx.

The '''M702iS''' version was released as the NTT DoCoMo version of the V3xx which does not have GSM, HSDPA but rather IrDA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/product/foma/702i/m702is/index.html NTT DoCoMo FOMA M702iS]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motorola RAZR maxx (or MOTORAZR maxx) was released at the end of 2006 in Europe and on April 27, 2007 elsewhere. The maxx is an upgrade of the popular V3x and is Motorola's second [[HSDPA]] 3.5G phone after Motorola RAZR V3xx. Although almost identical to the V3x in use and features, the maxx supports additional external touch keys for music control and retains the size of the original RAZR V3.

====AT&amp;T Wireless====
The RAZR maxx V6 (European Version) will not work with AT&amp;T's HSDPA network for it lacks the 850/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz [[W-CDMA]] bands. Alternately, prototype versions of the maxx are [[quadband]] phones featuring the 850/900/1800/1900&amp;nbsp;MHz bands.

====Telstra Australia====
This handset has been released on [[Telstra]]'s [[NextG]] network under the original name &quot;Motorola RAZR maxx V6&quot;. This phone features compatibility with both the original 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz band and the newer [[NextG]] band, 850&amp;nbsp;MHz. It should therefore also be capable of roaming to the AT&amp;T 850&amp;nbsp;MHz HSDPA network. The front of the phone is branded with the Telstra logo and on-screen presentation graphics have a Telstra theme. The phone was released by Telstra for outright purchase in late 2006 at a price of about A$800.  However, the phone has been plagued with hardware and software reliability problems that are well documented in Australian phone discussion forums. It has not sold well and Telstra now owns a large inventory of unsold stock.  The phone was repackaged late in 2007 and it is now sold with a prepaid plan for $250, locked for use only with Telstra SIM cards.  A $50 unlocking fee applies. Many of the post-paid phones sold by Telstra in 2007 were inadvertently locked.  These can be unlocked free by calling Telstra's unlocking line in Australia on 1300 720 179.  (Bypass the automated system that seeks a credit card number by entering random numbers, then speak to an operator to access the free service.)

====Hutchison 3====
This handset has been released on [[Hutchison Whampoa|Hutchison]]'s [[3 (telecommunications)|3]] network under the original name &quot;Motorola RAZR maxx V6&quot;. The back of the phone is branded with the 3 logo, also have the customized home screen, internal memory is increased to 60 MB, the phone startup screen is modified, and on-screen presentation graphics have a 3 theme.

===maxx Ve===
====Verizon Wireless====
The RAZR maxx Ve is available exclusively in the United States for Verizon Wireless customers. The maxx Ve features EV-DO instead of HSDPA and CDMA2000 1x instead of GSM/UMTS.

The RAZR maxx was a new 3G HSDPA and EDGE handset predated by the RAZR V3x. Initially known as the &quot;maxx V6,&quot; it was released in Europe by the end of 2006. Additionally [[Motorola]] had released pictures on its website of the Verizon version. The original version has a 2.0 Megapixel camera with [[LED]] flash, a large {{convert|2.2|in|mm|sing=on}} screen with 240x320 [[Quarter VGA|QVGA]] display (like the V3xx) and 50 megabytes of internal storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This phone was available in Australia from [[Telstra]] on their 850&amp;nbsp;MHz Next G network.

The Verizon Wireless version became available on 24 April 2007.

The Verizon Wireless version, the RAZR maxx Ve, did not have the second camera on the inside of the phone. Instead, there was a shutter button for focusing and picture taking. The Ve featured Verizon's menu system, but is said to support OBEX profiles, unlike Verizon's current RAZR V3m.

==Droid RAZR==
{{Main|Motorola Droid RAZR}}
On October 18, 2011, Motorola and Verizon Wireless officially unveiled the Droid RAZR, calling it &quot;the world's thinnest 4G smartphone.&quot; The phone is 7.1mm thick, features an 8 [[Megapixel|MP]] rear camera, and has a  dual-core 1.2 GHz processor and 1 GB of RAM. It has a 4.3-inch qHD display with [[Super AMOLED]] Advanced technology and is powered by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.3. The Droid RAZR will be available in early November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2011/10/18/droid-razr/ |title=Motorola Unveils Droid Razr, Worldâs Thinnest Smartphone |last=Banks |first=Emily |date=2011-10-18 |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
The RAZR has been said to be the ''&quot;[[iPod]]&quot;'' of mobile phones{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Being the slimmest phone during its release in 2004, it easily stood out amongst other phone models. It has also been one of the most popular mobile phones since its first release, until being surpassed by the [[iPhone 3G]] in November 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/153666/apples_iphone_so_far_the_best_phone_ever.html |title=Apple's iPhone: So Far, the Best Phone Ever? |publisher=PC World |date=2008-11-11 |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been spotted in the hands of celebrities and businessmen alike, it is frequently seen in movies and TV shows.

It is also a token piece in the popular modernized board game, [[Monopoly Here &amp; Now]].

===In popular culture===
Since its release the RAZR has become identified as a 'fashion' product and an iconic cell phone.&lt;ref name=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;{{citation|date=26 June 2006 |title=The World's Most Iconic Cell Phones |url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/06/26/mobile-razr-brick_cx_df_0626cellicon.html |first=Dan |last=Frommer |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RAZR has since been used in several television shows and featured in several movies. Notable occasions were the [[Through the Looking Glass (Lost)|season three finale]] of the TV series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in which [[Jack Shephard]] used a RAZR (an important plot point which anchors the episode's chronology), and USA hit series ''[[Burn Notice (TV series)|Burn Notice]]'' in which [[Michael Westen]] used a RAZR until 2009. Contestants on the NBC adventure reality show &quot;Treasure Hunters&quot; were given RAZRs for communication with the host and each other throughout the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = 11 July 2006| url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13689218| title = Is âTreasure Huntersâ copying âAmazing Raceâ? | publisher = MSNBC| accessdate =2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Product Red]] edition of the RAZR was launched by [[Oprah]] and [[Bono]] for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date = 12 October 2006| url =http://www.macnn.com/articles/06/10/12/red.razr.and.ipod.nano/| title = iPod nano, Motorola RAZR to go Red for charity | publisher =MacNN| accessdate =2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grey-coloured V3 was also used by [[Jeremy Clarkson]] on [[BBC]]'s ''[[Top Gear]]'' during outtakes when he got a call at the start of the show.
It was popularised in South [[India]] through the movie [[Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu]] in which [[Kamal Haasan]] was seen using the phone.
The popularity of RAZR in the United States was never replicated worldwide. While at first successful as a fashion phone abroad, its newer and cheaper models never became iconic{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.
