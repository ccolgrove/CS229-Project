'''''Motown Chartbusters''''' are a series of [[compilation album]]s first released by [[EMI]] under licence on the [[Tamla Motown]] label in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In total, 12 editions were released in the UK between 1967 and 1982.  The first two (volume 1 and volume 2) were originally called '''''British Motown Chartbusters'''''; after this they used the title ''Motown Chartbusters''.

==Background==
Early Motown Records releases in Britain were not on the Motown label, but were issued on the [[London]], [[Fontana]], [[Oriole]] and [[EMI]]'s [[Stateside]] labels.  Motown's first number 1 in Britain was &quot;[[Baby Love]]&quot; by [[The Supremes]], released on the Stateside label. &quot;[[Where Did Our Love Go]]&quot; by The Supremes, and &quot;[[My Guy]]&quot; by [[Mary Wells]] were amongst other big hits at the time, also released on the Stateside label. The first release on the [[Tamla Motown]] label was &quot;[[Stop In The Name Of Love]]&quot; by The Supremes, in March 1965.

By 1964, Motown had enough British hits under its belt for EMI to release a greatest hits album, ''A Collection of Tamla Motown Big Hits''.&lt;ref&gt;''A Collection of Tamla Motown Big Hits'' at Discogs.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few years, several more compilations were released, including six in the series ''16 Original Big Hits''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flickr.com/photos/cookephotography/4507979984/ ''16 Original Big Hits vol.6'']&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967, the label issued the first of the ''Motown Chartbusters'' series.  Although the series mainly comprised hit singles by various Motown artists, they also included other recordings that had not been hits in Britain.  Many significant single hits were excluded from the series. Later albums in the series failed to include any of the top ten singles achieved by [[Stevie Wonder]], or any of his releases. Minor hits were sometimes included in place of bigger hits, most notably for the [[Jackson 5]] and [[Michael Jackson]].

The original albums were made by EMI under licence from Motown. EMI also made 8 track recordings of the early releases.  In total, 12 editions were released in the UK, spanning 15 years from 1967 to 1982. All 12 were Top 30 [[UK Albums Chart|UK chart]] entries, the second volume of British Motown Chartbusters hit No. 8 in January 1970, in the same year Volume 3 spent six weeks at the No. 2 position, before reaching No. 1. In 1971 Volume 5 went to No. 2 and, in 1973, Volume 8 went to No. 9.  The series was the most successful set of compilation albums in terms of sales until the release of the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music]]'' series began in the mid-1980s.  A compilation album, ''[[Now That's What I Call Motown]]'' was released on the [[Universal Motown]] label.

They were re-issued from 1997 by the budget label, Spectrum. The clear differences between the two releases are the logos on the disc and cover, the original release has the Tamla Motown logo; the re-release has the Motown logo.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

After their success in the UK, Motown went on to release different variants in other counties such as the United States and Australia.  There were also various other forms released on the same type of platform such as ''Motown Chartbusters'', ''150 Hits of Gold'' and boxed sets.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==''United States Motown Chartbusters''==

Three years later after the first release of British Motown Chartbusters, Motown released a series called âMotown Chartbusters&quot; on the Motown label in the United States. This consisted of only five albums which had completely different track listings to the UK releases.

Another difference was the number of tracks per album, the UK version consisted of 16 to 18 tracks, whereas the US version only had 12 tracks.
