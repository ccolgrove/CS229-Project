La Crosse State Normal School students began organizing several extra-curricular activities within two years of the school's founding. In 1910, students published the first campus newspaper, ''The Racquet'', which is still published today. The Physical Education Club was formed in 1912, making it the longest continuous organization in the school's history.

In 1926, George M. Snodgrass became the school's third president, replacing Ernest A. Smith, who served for only one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;president&quot; /&gt; That same year the school's programs were expanded and authorization was given to award baccalaureate teaching degrees.  This led to an institutional name change the following year to '''La Crosse State Teachers College'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot; /&gt;

In 1931 the college was divided into separate elementary education, secondary education, and physical education divisions. It was also this year that the [[homecoming]] tradition of the &quot;Hanging of the Lantern&quot; began at the south entrance of Maurice O. Graff Main Hall.  It was created by English teacher Orris O. White who remarked, &quot;We'll hang the lantern in the old college tower... You won't need to look for the key - the door will be open.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

=== Post World War II years ===
After the Regents authorized the nine Wisconsin State Teachers Colleges to establish baccalaureate degrees in liberal arts, the college changed its name to Wisconsin State College-La Crosse in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot; /&gt; It was also this same year that Wilder Hall became the first campus [[residence hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A graduate program in physical education was also established at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot; /&gt; Florence Wing Library, the college's first library, was constructed that same year and began a period of substantial expansion for the college.  Over the next 18 years (1956â1974), the college ballooned from 5 buildings to a total of 23 buildings.  The college added 11 residence halls, 4 academic buildings, 2 libraries, and 2 student centers during that time.

In 1959, the college celebrated its 50th anniversary, with an enrollment of 1,821 students. That same year presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] visited campus and spoke to a packed Graff Main Hall auditorium.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

In 1964, the college was designated a university as part of the [[Wisconsin State University System]] and was renamed Wisconsin State UniversityâLa Crosse.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot; /&gt; This designation led to the creation of the Colleges of Education, Health-Recreation-Physical Education, and Letters and Sciences. Later, the School of Business Administration was also formed within College of Letters and Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;intro&quot; /&gt; A few years after receiving university designation, the university's fifth president, Samuel G. Gates, began his term in 1966.

The [[Wisconsin State University System]] merged with the [[University of Wisconsin System]] in 1971, at which time the university adopted its current name and also changed the title for the head of the university from [[University President|President]] to [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]]. Kenneth E. Lindner, who was at the time the university's sixth president, became the university's first [[chancellor]]. Lindner, after serving as chancellor from 1971â1979, was succeeded by Noel Richards, who served as the university's chancellor until 1991.&lt;ref name= &quot;president&quot; /&gt; Lindner Forest, a heavily wooded section in the southern part of campus, was named in honor of former Chancellor Lindner.

In 1989, the university's mascot became the [[Eagle]]. UWâL men's athletics teams had previously been known as the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] (1937â1989),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt; Red Raiders, Hurricanes, Racqueteers, and Peds and Maroons.  The women's athletic teams were known as the Roonies, derived from the university's school colors of maroon and gray, since the inception of female intercollegiate competition in the early 1970s.  They adopted the Eagle mascot a year after it became the university mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;tradition&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = UWâL Traditions | work = | publisher = University of WisconsinâLa Crosse Athletic Department | year = 2007 | url = http://www.uwlax.edu/athletics/traditions/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the adoption of the Eagle mascot, the band's mascot has been the Screaming Eagle, having been known as the Marching Chiefs before that.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt; The &quot;Eagle in the L&quot; and [[caricature]], which were both created in 1989, were unveiled just before the fall sports teams took to the field as the Eagles for the first time.

In 1991, Judith Kuipers became UWâL's third chancellor, serving until 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;president&quot; /&gt;  She was the institution's first and only female leader.

Today, the university continues to offer much to the area and the state of [[Wisconsin]], including cultural events, regional and national conferences, prominent speakers, applied research, health care, professionals with varying expertise, a large workforce, and numerous faculty, staff and student community volunteers. The percentage of the university's budget that is state funded has declined over the past few years, as it has at many public universities throughout the nation. In 1996, students paid 35% of the cost of their education at UWâL and the state the remaining 65%. By 2005, the student share had grown to 51% as the stateâs shrunk to 49%.&lt;ref name=&quot;centennial&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The compact {{convert|119|acre|ha|0|sing=on}} campus is located in a residential section of La Crosse.

Hoeschler Tower (1996), located in the heart of UWâL, is the focal point of campus and a popular destination and meeting place for students.&lt;ref name=&quot;hoeschler&quot; /&gt; It is also the site for many university and student events, such as concerts, fundraisers, the clocktower dance, memorial services, and the traditional hanging of the lantern.

[[Sidewalk chalk]] is used as a means of communication among students throughout the warmer months. It is used by as a way of advertising future events, sharing personal ideas, and promoting political agendas, among other things.

A new residence hall, to be the largest on campus and has yet to be named, is being built on what was Coate Field. Further construction plans include constructing a new student building to replace an aging Cartwright Center, a new science building to replace an aging Cowley Hall, and a parking structure to replace gravel parking lots on the north side of campus.

Fitness and exercise is an important part of the campus culture at the University of WisconsinâLa Crosse. The student body is very active in athletics, whether they be varsity, [[intramural]], or simply recreational. The Recreational Eagle Center is often filled with students trying to stay fit and healthy. Students take advantage of the many [[rustic]] areas for hiking and biking in and around La Crosse. Renting a [[canoe]] or [[kayak]] from the Recreational Eagle Center to take on one of the region's many rivers is also a popular activity. In the winter, sleds are available to students. Pass-fail activity classes such as [[yoga]], [[strength training]], and [[rock climbing]] are often taken by students as a way to meet new people, explore new activities, and to get a workout.  This dedication by UWâL students to health and exercise has been recognized by ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'' magazine, which ranked UWâL the 10th fittest campuses in the country in 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;menshealth1&quot;/&gt; and 12th fittest in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;menshealth&quot;/&gt;

== Symbols and traditions ==
The university's school colors are [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and [[gray]]. The current university mascot, which was adopted in 1989, is the [[Eagle]].  UWâL men's athletics teams had previously been known as the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] (1937â1989),&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt; Red Raiders, Hurricanes, Racqueteers, and Peds and Maroons.  The women's athletic teams were known as the Roonies, derived from the university's school colors of maroon and gray, since the inception of female intercollegiate competition in the early 1970s until November 1990 when they also adopted the Eagle mascot.&lt;ref name=&quot;tradition&quot; /&gt; Since the adoption of the Eagle mascot, the band's mascot has been the Screaming Eagle, having been known as the Marching Chiefs before that.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot; /&gt;

=== The Eagle mascot ===
UWâLa Crosse's athletic teams sport a contemporary &quot;Eagle in the L&quot; and [[caricature]] which was created in 1989, right before the fall sports teams took to the field as the Eagles for the first time. It was created by Dave Christianson, a 1973 art major graduate who penned the images after the UWâL men's teams adopted the Eagle mascot. Women's teams started sporting the Eagles moniker in November 1990. Both the &quot;Eagle in the L&quot; and the eagle caricature were unveiled in August 1989.  The UW-L Eagle mascot was named &quot;Colbert&quot; in a vote by students during the 2008-09 school year.  The original vote declared that Eddie the Eagle be the name of the mascot, however the NRA mascot is also Eddie the Eagle and there was potential for a lawsuit.  As a result of a second vote, Colbert was chosen.&lt;ref name=&quot;eagle&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwlathletics.com/sports/2009/10/6/GEN_1006092556.aspx?tab=eaglemascot&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hanging of the Lantern ===
The Hanging of the Lantern's origin dates back to 1913 when UWâL students would hang small lanterns in house windows near campus. In 1931, longtime faculty member Orris O. White began a tradition of hanging one large lantern in the Maurice O. Graff Main Hall tower, above the building's south entrance. The act welcomed [[alumni]] who had returned home. &quot;We'll hang the lantern in the old college tower over the south door. You won't need to look for the key â the door will be open,&quot; declared White.

Since 1931, a lantern has hung each [[Homecoming]]. The lantern hung on the south side of Graff Main Hall until 1997 when it was moved to the Hoeschler Tower in the center of campus. While the tower's lantern hangs year-round, it is only lit during Homecoming.

=== Lighting of the &quot;L&quot; ===
UWâLa Crosse's other tradition, the Lighting of the &quot;L,&quot; began in 1935 after Lucifer rose again as a college prank. F. Clark Carnes and Bernie Brown were bored on a foggy day, so they hiked up Miller's Bluff, which is north of [[Grandad Bluff]]. They gathered and piled brush in the shape of a {{convert|30|ft|m|sing=on}} by {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} &quot;L.&quot;

Brown and Carnes then decided to start the brush &quot;L&quot; on fire. They headed down the bluff to a gas station and returned with a five-gallon can to douse the brush. Brown and Carnes could see the police lights heading toward the bluff, so they lit the brush and slipped down the bluff toward campus before the police could locate them. When Brown and Carnes reached [[Veterans Memorial Stadium (La Crosse)|Veterans Memorial Stadium]], the fog lifted and allowed the crowd to see the &quot;L.&quot;

In recent years, the &quot;L&quot; has been lit by electricity and shines from [[Grandad Bluff]].
