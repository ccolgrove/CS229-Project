The '''Florida Gators baseball''' team represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[baseball]].  The Florida Gators compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]] (NCAA), and the Eastern Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  They play their home games in [[Alfred A. McKethan Stadium]] on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus, and are currently led by head coach [[Kevin O'Sullivan (baseball)|Kevin O'Sullivan]].  In the ninety-six season history of the Gators baseball program, the team has won twelve SEC championships and has appeared in seven [[College World Series]] tournaments.

== History ==

The modern University of Florida was created in 1905 when the [[Florida Legislature]] passed the [[Henry Holland Buckman|Buckman Act]], and thereby consolidated the university's four predecessor institutions into the new &quot;[[History of the University of Florida|University of the State of Florida]].&quot;  The university fielded its first varsity baseball team, and enjoyed its first winning baseball season, in 1912.&lt;ref name=ufbaseballsupplement&gt;''[http://web.gatorzone.com/baseball/media/2011/supplement.pdf  2011 Florida Gators Baseball  Media Supplement]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 93&amp;ndash;94, 95&amp;ndash;97, 98&amp;ndash;101, 112&amp;ndash;125 (2011).  Retrieved June 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of the Gators baseball program's early existence, the new university's athletic association suffered from a lack of financial resources, and few of the Gators head baseball coaches were full-time baseball coaches.  [[William G. Kline]] was also the [[athletic director]], head football coach, and head basketball coach; [[James L. White (coach)|James L. White]] was the Gators' athletic director and head basketball coach; [[Brady Cowell]], [[List of University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame members#Men's basketball|Ben Clemons]] and [[Lewie Hardage]] were assistant football coaches; and [[Sam J. McAllister|Sam McAllister]] was the head basketball coach and an assistant football coach.  A notable exception was [[Lance Richbourg]], who was a Florida alumnus and a [[Major League Baseball]] outfielder for the [[Boston Braves]] and others, and led the Gators to an impressive 39&amp;ndash;21 overall record (a .650 winning percentage) in 1922, 1923 and 1926.  McAllister was the Gators' last pre-[[World War II]] coach, and he returned from military service to lead the Gators baseball team again in 1946 and 1947.&lt;ref name=ufbaseballsupplement/&gt;

=== Fuller era: 1948&amp;ndash;1975 ===

The modern post-war era of the Florida Gators baseball program began with head coach [[Dave Fuller]] assuming control in 1948.  Fuller was originally hired as a physical education instructor in 1946, and also served as an assistant football coach under four different Gators head coaches.  Ultimately, he became the longest-serving Gators head coach in any sport, and won more games than any other Gators coach, after leading the Gators baseball team for twenty-eight seasons.  Fuller brought stability and consistency to the program, and his Gators teams won SEC championships in 1952, 1956 and 1962, and made appearances in the NCAA tournament in 1958, 1960 and 1962.  His final record was 557&amp;ndash;354&amp;ndash;6 (.611).&lt;ref name=ufbaseballsupplement/&gt;

=== Bergman era: 1976&amp;ndash;1981 ===

Fuller's successor, [[Jay Bergman]], advanced the Gators baseball program a step further.  After a difficult transition season in 1976, Bergman's Gators showed marked improvement, winning an SEC championship and SEC tournament title in 1981.  His teams also qualified for the NCAA Regionals in 1977, 1979 and 1981, and compiled a 7&amp;ndash;6 tournament record, but in each instance did not advance beyond the double-elimination opening round of the NCAA tournament.  In his six seasons as the Gators' skipper, Bergman posted an overall win-loss record of 216&amp;ndash;113 (.657)&amp;mdash;the best multi-season winning percentage until that time, and still the second best in Gators baseball history.&lt;ref name=ufbaseballsupplement/&gt;

=== Arnold era: 1984&amp;ndash;1994 ===

[[Joe Arnold]] followed Jack Rhines' short two-season stint as the Gators' head coach.  Arnold's Gators won SEC championships in 1984 and 1988, and SEC tournament titles in 1984, 1988 and 1991.  His teams made seven appearances in the NCAA tournament, and for the first and second time ever, the Gators advanced to the [[College World Series]] in [[1988 College World Series|1988]] and [[1991 College World Series|1991]].  In eleven seasons coaching the Gators, Arnold compiled an overall record of 434&amp;ndash;244&amp;ndash;2 (.640).&lt;ref name=ufbaseballsupplement/&gt;

=== Lopez era: 1995&amp;ndash;2000 ===

[[Andy Lopez]] took over the program in 1995, two seasons removed from leading the [[Pepperdine Waves]] of [[Pepperdine University]] to their only national championship in the [[1993 College World Series]].  In his second season as the Gators head coach in 1996, he led the Gators to a fifty-win season and the semifinals of the [[1996 College World Series|College World Series]].  In 2000 and 2001, however, the Gators were eliminated in the opening rounds of the NCAA tournament, and Lopez was replaced.  In seven seasons, Lopez posted an overall record of 278&amp;ndash;159&amp;ndash;1 (.636).&lt;ref name=ufbaseballsupplement/&gt;

=== McMahon era: 2001&amp;ndash;2007 ===

[[Pat McMahon (coach)|Pat McMahon]] became the Gators' head baseball coach in 2001, after coaching the [[Mississippi State Bulldogs baseball|Mississippi State Bulldogs]] for the four preceding seasons.&lt;ref name=mcmahonufprofile&gt;GatorZone.com, Baseball History, 2007 Roster, [http://web.gatorzone.com/baseball/bios.php?year=2007&amp;staff=mcmahon  Pat McMahon].  Retrieved June 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=3047&amp;sport=baseb&amp;html=baseball/news/20010613110500.html  Pat McMahon Hired As Florida Baseball Coach],&quot; GatorZone.com (June 13, 2001).  Retrieved June 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the 2003 season, the Gators began to make a comeback with several freshly scouted prospects, including Andy Ramirez (first base) David Headage (right field), and Randy Thompson (shortstop).  The 2003 season set the standard for the next two years of baseball, entering the NCAA tournament in both the 2003 and 2004 seasons.  The 2005 season was the best in school history, as the team won the SEC championship and advanced to the [[2005 College World Series|College World Series]] for the first time in seven years, ultimately losing to the [[Texas Longhorns baseball|Texas Longhorns]], two games to none in the final championship round of the Series.

The expectations for the Gators were high in 2006; they were the consensus No. 1 team in the preseason polls, but the team struggled through the 2006 season.&lt;ref name=mcmahonufprofile/&gt;  The Gators found themselves one game under .500 (26&amp;ndash;27) heading into their final series against the [[LSU Tigers baseball|LSU Tigers]] in Gainesville.  The team surprisingly won two of the three games to finish the season at .500 (28&amp;ndash;28).  The Gators' 10&amp;ndash;20 SEC record was the second worst in the conference, and they did not qualify for the SEC Tournament, nor were they selected for the NCAA Regionals.

After missing the NCAA Regionals again in 2007, McMahon was fired on June 7, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Zimmerman, &quot;[http://www.gatorsports.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070607/MISC/70607052/Baseball_coach_McMahon_fired  UF fires McMahon],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (June 7, 2007).

=== O'Sullivan era: 2008&amp;ndash;present ===

[[Kevin O'Sullivan (baseball)|Kevin O'Sullivan]] became the head coach of the Florida Gators baseball team following the 2007 season.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Zimmerman, &quot;[http://www.gatorsports.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070613/GATORS04/70613015/UF_selects_baseball_coach  UF selects baseball coach],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (June 13, 2007).
