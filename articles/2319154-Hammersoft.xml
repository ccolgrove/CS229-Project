'''Reginald''' is a masculine [[given name]] in the [[English language|English]] language.

==Etymology and history==
The name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''Reginaldus'', which has been influenced by the Latin word ''regina'', meaning &quot;[[:wikt:queen|queen]]&quot;. This Latin name is a [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisation]] of a [[Germanic language|Germanic]] language name. This Germanic name is composed of two elements: the first ''ragin'', meaning &quot;advice&quot;, &quot;counsel&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ancestry-surname&quot;/&gt; &quot;decision&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanks1&quot;/&gt; the second element is ''wald'', meaning &quot;rule&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;ancestry-surname&quot;/&gt; &quot;ruler&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanks1&quot;/&gt; The [[Old German]] form of the name is ''Raginald''; [[Old French]] forms are ''Reinald'' and ''Reynaud''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reaney&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Reaney |first=Percy Hilde |coauthors=Wilson, Richard Middlewood |title=A Dictionary of English Surnames |edition=3rd |year=2006 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |isbn=0-203-99355-1 |page=2626 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of this Germanic name were first brought to the British Isles by Scandinavians, in the form of the Old Norse ''RÃ¶gnvaldr''. This name was later reinforced by the arrival of the Normans in the 11th century, in the [[Norman language|Norman]] forms ''Reinald'' and ''Reynaud''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ancestry-surname&quot;&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ancestry.com/learn/facts/default.aspx? |title=Learn about the family history of your surname |publisher=[[Ancestry.com]] |accessdate=2 November 2010}} which cited: {{citation |title=Dictionary of American Family Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-508137-4 }} for the surname &quot;Reynold&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
''Reginald'' and ''Reginaldus'' are used as Latinisations of the [[Old Irish]], [[Middle Irish]]/[[Middle Gaelic]] ''[[Ragnall (given name)|Ragnall]]''. This Gaelic name is cognate of ''Reginald'', since ''Ragnall'' is derived from the Old Norse ''RÃ¶gnvaldr''.

The Scottish names ''Ronald'' and ''Ranald'', originating in Western Scotland and the [[Northern Isles]], are cognate with the [[Gall-GhÃ idheil]] ''Raghnall/RÃ¶gnvaldr'', cf. [[Clan MacDonald of ClanRanald]], descendants of [[Raghnall mac Somhairle]], [[King of Mann and the Isles]].

==Use and popularity==
Today ''Reginald'' is regarded as a very formal name, and bearers generally shorten their name to ''Reg'' in ordinary usage. ''[[Reggie (pet name)|Reggie]]'' is a pet form of ''Reg''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanks1&quot;&gt;{{citation |last1=Hanks |first1=Patrick |last2=Hardcastle |authorlink1=Patrick Hanks |first2=Kate |last3=Hodges |first3=Flavia |title=A Dictionary of First Names |edition=2nd |series=Oxford Paperback Reference |year=2006 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn=978-0-19-861060-1 |pages=228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
