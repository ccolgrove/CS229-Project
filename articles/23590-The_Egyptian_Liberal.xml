The word derives from the Greek (''[[wikt:pan|pan]]'') meaning &quot;all&quot; and the Greek (''[[wikt:theos|theos]]'') meaning &quot;God&quot;.  As such, Pantheism denotes the idea that &quot;God&quot; is best seen as a process of relating to the Universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deity&quot;&gt;Owen, H. P. ''Concepts of Deity''. London: Macmillan, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are divergences within Pantheism, the central ideas found in almost all versions are the Cosmos as an all-encompassing unity and the sacredness of Nature.
[[File:PanthÃ©isme.JPG|thumb| There is no official universal symbol for all types of Pantheism, but one icon is used by the [[World Pantheist Movement]] (WPM): the spiral as seen in the curves of the nautilus shell, or in the spiral arms of a galaxy, showing the link between the cosmic physical and the biological. The spiral represents a variety of things: it means evolution, eternity, spirituality, growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantheism.net pantheism.net].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the Nautilus spiral alone is used; it embodies the [[Fibonacci series]] and the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantheism.net/pan/Pan9.pdf pantheism.net].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In Pantheism, God is identical with the universe, but in [[Panentheism|Pan''en''theism]] God lies within and also beyond or outside of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

The term âPantheism&quot; is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''pan'' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:Ïá¾¶Î½|Ïá¾¶Î½]]}}) meaning &quot;[[The All|all]]&quot; and ''theos'' (''[[wikt:Î¸ÎµÏÏ|Î¸ÎµÏÏ]]'') meaning [[God]], in the sense of [[theism]]. The term ''pantheist'' â from which the word ''Pantheism'' was derived â was purportedly first used in English by [[Irish people|Irish]] writer [[John Toland]] in his 1705 work &quot;[[Socinianism]] Truly Stated, by a pantheist&quot;. He clarified the idea in a 1710 letter to [[Gottfried Leibniz]] when he referred to &quot;the pantheistic opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Paul Harrison, ''Elements of Pantheism'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many earlier writers, schools of philosophy, and religious movements expressed pantheistic ideas.

They include some of the [[Presocratics]], such as [[Heraclitus]] and [[Anaximander]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The [[Stoics]] were Pantheists, beginning with [[Zeno of Citium]] and culminating in the emperor-philosopher [[Marcus Aurelius]]. During the pre-Christian Roman Empire, [[Stoicism]] was one of the three dominant schools of philosophy, along with [[Epicureanism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The early [[Daoism|Taoism]] of [[Lao Zi]] and [[Zhuangzi]] is also pantheistic.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In the West, Pantheism went into retreat during the Christian years between the 4th and 15th centuries, when it was regarded as heresy. The first open revival was by [[Giordano Bruno]] (burned at the stake in 1600). [[Baruch Spinoza]]{{'s}} ''Ethics'', finished in 1675, was the major source from which Pantheism spread (though Spinoza himself did not use the word, and there is some controversy over whether he may more accurately be termed a panentheist&lt;ref&gt;Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (October 2, 1996), ISBN 978-0-415-10782-2, Page: 40&lt;/ref&gt;. [[John Toland]] was influenced by both Spinoza and Bruno. In 1720 he wrote the ''Pantheisticon: or The Form of Celebrating the Socratic-Society'' in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantheism.net/paul/toland.htm Toland: The father of modern pantheism (pantheism.net)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1785 a major controversy known in German as the [[Pantheism controversy|Pantheismus-Streit (Pantheism controversy)]] between critic [[Friedrich Jacobi]] and defender [[Moses Mendelssohn]] helped to spread awareness of Pantheism to many German thinkers in the late 18th and in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friedrich-jacobi/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (plato.stanford.edu)].&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time during the 19th century it seemed like Pantheism was the religion of the future, attracting figures such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Coleridge]] in Britain; [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in Germany; [[Walt Whitman]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] in the USA. Seen as a threat by the Vatican, it came under attack in the [[Syllabus of Errors]] of [[Pope Pius XI|Pius IX]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9syll.htm Syllabus or Errors 1.1 (papalencyclicals.net)].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the 20th century Pantheism was sidelined by political ideologies such as Communism and Fascism, by the traumatic upheavals of two world wars, and later by relativistic philosophies such as [[Existentialism]] and [[Post-Modernism]]. It persisted in eminent pantheists such as the novelist [[D. H. Lawrence]], scientist [[Albert Einstein]], poet [[Robinson Jeffers]], architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and historian [[Arnold Toynbee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Recent developments==
In the late 20th century, Pantheism began to see a resurgence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Pantheism chimed with the growing ecological awareness in society and the media. It was described as &quot;Hollywoodâs religion of choice for a generation now&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Heaven and Nature, Ross Douthat, New York Times, December 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and often declared to be the underlying âtheologyâ of [[Paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;Margot Adler, Drawing Down the Moon, Beacon Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; 1975 saw the foundation of the [[Universal Pantheist Society]], however it remained extremely small. The creation of the naturalistic [[World Pantheist Movement]] in 1999, with its multiple mailing lists and social networks, led to much wider visibility.

[[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The God Delusion]]'' gave [[Naturalistic Pantheism]] increased credibility among atheists by describing it as âsexed-up atheism.â &lt;ref&gt;[[The God Delusion]]. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Holy See|Vatican]] gave Pantheism further prominence in a Papal encyclical of 2009&lt;ref name=&quot;Caritas In Veritate, July 7, 2009&quot;&gt;Caritas In Veritate, July 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and a New Year's Day statement on January 1, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Message Of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI For The Celebration Of The World Day Of Peace.&lt;/ref&gt; which criticized Pantheism for denying the superiority of humans over nature and &quot;seeing the source of man{{'s}} salvation in nature&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caritas In Veritate, July 7, 2009&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, [[Albert Einstein]]'s 1954 German letter in which he dismissed belief in God was auctioned off for more than $330,000 US. Einstein wrote, &quot;the word 'God' is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Einstein letter dismissing God sells for $330,000 US| publisher=CBC Canada| date=2008-05-15 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2008/05/15/einstein-letter.html| accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly,â he wrote in another letter in 1954. Einstein relates his belief to Pantheism: &quot;If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Belief in God a 'product of human weaknesses': Einstein letter| publisher=CBC Canada| date=2008-05-13 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2008/05/13/einstein-religion.html| accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
All varieties of Pantheism involve reverence for the Universe/Cosmos as a [[all|totality]], and all stress some kind of unity. All have a strong emphasis on the natural world as a focus of reverence and of ethics. There are three major categories of Pantheism, which differ as to whether they regard reality as made up of only one type of [[substance theory|substance]], or two, and what that type of substance is.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

===Monist Physicalist Pantheism===
[[Monism|Monist]] [[physicalist]] Pantheism or [[Naturalistic Pantheism]] holds that there is only one type of substance, and that substance is physical, i.e. able at its most basic level to be described by physics, though more complex phenomena such as life, consciousness and societies can appear through emergence. Historically this version was held by Stoics such as [[Zeno of Citium]] or [[Marcus Aurelius]], and in modern times by [[John Toland]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[D.H. Lawrence]] and [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]]. This version is represented today by the [[World Pantheist Movement]]. In this version, the term ''god'' â if used at all â is basically a synonym for Nature or Universe, seen from the point of view of reverence.

===Monist Idealist Pantheism===
Monist [[idealist]] Pantheism or [[Monistic Idealism]] holds that there is only one type of substance, and that substance is mental or spiritual. Some versions hold that the ultimate reality consists of a single [[cosmic consciousness]]. This version is common in Hindu philosophies and Consciousness-Only schools of [[Buddhism]], as well as in some [[New Age]] writers such as [[Deepak Chopra]]. This is distinguished from [[pandeism]] in that pandeism asserts that the whole of reality was at some time sentient.

===Dualist Pantheism===
[[Dualist Pantheism]] holds that there are two major types of substance, physical and mental/spiritual, which interact or are unified in some way. [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualistic]] pantheism is very diverse, and may include beliefs in [[reincarnation]], [[cosmic consciousness]], and paranormal connections across Nature. Criticisms of this interpretation are generally related to the [[Mind-body problem]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mind &amp; Society'', Volume 1, Number 2, 73-85, DOI: 10.1007/BF02512314.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Use of religious vocabulary===
A significant debate within the pantheistic community is about the use of the word âGod.â Pantheists do not believe in a God in the common and traditional sense of a personal creator being. Some modern Pantheists avoid using God-words altogether, since they regard them as misleading. Others feel that the word God is essential to express the strength of their feelings towards Nature and the Universe.

Some critics have argued that pantheism is little more than a redefinition of the word âGodâ to mean âNature,â âUniverseâ, or â[[reality]]â.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} 

When pantheism is considered in relation to theism, there is a denial of theistic claims. For example, theism is the belief in a âpersonalâ God that [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] (is separate from) the world.  Pantheists deny the existence of a personal God.  Some deny the existence of a Being that has intentional states and associated capacities such as the ability to make decisions. Some Pantheists recognize the intelligence involved in the rational and systematic functioning of Nature and the Universe, which is not necessarily intentional but is &quot;minded&quot; in a sense. [[Pandeism]] differs from Pantheism in that pandeism leaves that possibility of a sentient deity before the creation of the universe.

There are disagreements as to whether Pantheism is atheistic or not. Atheists argue the non-theistic god of pantheism is not a [[god]] (according to the traditional definition),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=R|last=Dawkins|title=[[The God Delusion]]|publisher=Transworld, a Black Swan Book|year=2006|ISBN=978-0-552-77331-7}} âPantheism is sexed-up atheismâ.&lt;/ref&gt; while others suggest a deity is not necessarily transcendent.&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP&quot;&gt;âWith some exceptions, pantheism is non-theistic, but it is not atheistic.â [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/#Ath Pantheism (plato.stanford.edu)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar concepts in other religious traditions==
{{God}}

===Taoism===
[[Taoism]] is pantheistic at least in the writings of its leading thinkers [[Lao Tzu]] and [[Zhuangzi]], although it later developed into a folk religion with many deities.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Tao te Ching]] by Lao Tzu rarely speaks of a personal or creator God. Its central focus, the [[Tao]] or Way, is conceived of as a mysterious and numinous unity, infinite and eternal, underlying all things and sustaining them. The Tao is always spoken of with profound religious reverence and respect, similar to the way that Pantheism discusses the &quot;divinity&quot; of the Universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; The ideal of Taoism was to live in harmony with the Tao and to cultivate a simple and frugal life, avoiding unnecessary action: &quot;Being one with nature, he [the sage] is in accord with the Tao.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tao te Ching, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhuangzi emphasized the pantheistic content of Taoism even more clearly. &quot;Heaven and I were created together, and all things and I are one.&quot; When Tung Kuo Tzu asked Zhuangzi where the Tao was, he replied that it was in the ant, the grass, the clay tile, even in excrement: &quot;There is nowhere where it is notâ¦ There is not a single thing without Tao.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pantheism.net/paul/chuang.htm Chuang Tzu - The butterfly philosopher (pantheism.net)].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
It is generally asserted that Hindu religious texts are the oldest known literature that contains Pantheistic ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''General Sketch of the History of Pantheism'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hindu [[theology]], [[Brahman]] is the unchanging, infinite, immanent, and transcendent reality which is the Divine Ground of all things in this Universe, and is also the sum total of all that ever is, was, or ever shall be. This idea of pantheism is traceable from some of the more ancient [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]] to [[vishishtadvaita]] philosophy. All [[MahÄvÄkyas|MahÄvÄkyas (Great Sayings)]] of the Upanishads, in one way or another, seem to indicate the unity of the world with the Brahmam. It further says âThis whole universe is Brahman, from Brahman to a clod of earth.&quot; Pantheism is a key component of [[Advaita]] philosophy. Other subdivisions of Vedanta do not strictly hold this tenet.

===Other religions===
There are many elements of pantheism in some forms of [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Neopaganism]], and [[Theosophy]] as well as in several tendencies in the major theistic religions. See also the Neopagan section of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and the [[Church of All Worlds]].

Many [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] consider themselves pantheists. The Islamic religious tradition, in particular [[Sufism]] and [[Alevi]]sm has a strong belief in the [[Monism#Islam|unitary nature]] of the universe and the concept that everything in it is an aspect of God itself, although this perspective leans closer to [[panentheism]] and may also be termed [[Theopanism]]. Many traditional and folk religions including [[African traditional religions]] and [[Native American religions]] can be seen as pantheistic, or a mixture of pantheism and other doctrines such as [[polytheism]] and [[animism]].

== Distinction from related concepts ==
Some other theological models have attempted to incorporate the perceived benefits of pantheism with the perceived benefits of [[classical theism|classical monotheism]].

The term [[panentheism]] (from Greek Ïá¾¶Î½ (pÃ¢n) &quot;all&quot;; á¼Î½ (en) &quot;in&quot;; and Î¸ÎµÏÏ (theÃ³s) &quot;God&quot;; &quot;all-in-God&quot;) was formally coined in Germany in the 19th Century to express a philosophical synthesis between traditional theism and pantheism, that God is substantially omnipresent in the physical universe but also in a sense exists &quot;apart from&quot; or &quot;beyond&quot; the universe as its Creator and Sustainer.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cooper, ''The Other God of the Philosophers'', Baker Academic, 2006, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus panentheism is not compatible with pantheism, in which God and the universe are synonymousâwith no part of God considered as being distinct from the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/religion/blrel_theism_panen.htm What is Panentheism?], atheism.about.com. About Agnosticism/Atheism. Retrieved 2 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same reasons, [[pandeism]] is ''not'' a form of pantheism. Though pandeism is characterized as a combination of  reconcilable elements of pantheism and [[deism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
