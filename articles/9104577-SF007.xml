'''Norton 360''', developed by [[Symantec]], is marketed as an &quot;all-in-one&quot; [[computer security]] suite. The package includes an [[antivirus]], a [[personal firewall]], a [[phishing]] protection program and a [[backup software|backup program]]. What distinguishes this suite from [[Norton Internet Security]] is the inclusion of file backup and [[Computer-aided maintenance|PC maintenance]] capabilities.

The package is distributed as a download, a [[Software release life cycle#Box copy|box copy]], or is preinstalled on computers as [[Original equipment manufacturer#Computers|OEM software]]. Additional functions, including [[parental controls]] and [[e-mail spam]] filtering, are available as extensions developed also by Symantec.

Norton 360 is compatible with [[Windows XP]] (excluding [[Windows XP editions#64-bit editions|64-bit editions]]), [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/norton/theme.jsp?themeid=windows7|title=Norton is ready for Windows 7|accessdate=2009-05-15|publisher=Symantec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.norton.com/norton/board/message?board.id=Win7Beta&amp;thread.id=616|title=Windows 7 Beta Compatibility

==Version history==
===''Project Genesis''===

Symantec announced ''Project Genesis'' on February 7, 2006. ''Genesis'' would differ from Symantec's other consumer security products by incorporating file backup and [[Computer performance|PC maintenance]] tools with antivirus capabilities and a firewall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Symantec considering Gdrive alternative | url=http://www.itworld.com/060512gdrive | work=Robert McMillan | publisher=The IDG Network | date=May 12, 2006 | accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phishing]] protection and real-time [[heuristics]] were also planned. [[Windows Vista]] compatibility was a major aspect of ''Genesis''. ''Genesis'' was slated for release in September. In May 2005, Microsoft announced [[Windows Live OneCare]], a security suite with similar functionalities, slated for release in 2006.

''Genesis'' was renamed ''Norton 360'' on May 31, 2006. Its feature set was confirmedâit would have the same functionalities of [[Norton Internet Security]]âwith file backup, PC maintenance, [[phishing]] protection, and real-time [[heuristics]]. A [[Beta (software)|public beta]] test was planned for summer 2006. The final release date was set at the end of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Symantec Roadmap Includes Massive 'Genesis' Suite | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1918142,00.asp | work=Ben Z.

OneCare was launched in summer 2006 while Falcon entered public beta testing.

Some viewed Norton 360 as a response to Microsoft's [[antivirus software]], OneCare. However, with the release of OneCare, some saw Symantec as lagging behind its rivals. Mark Bregman, Symantec's [[vice president]], claimed the upcoming Norton 360 was not intended to compete with OneCare, stating &quot;We somehow left the wrong impression in the market place that there's Windows Live OneCare from Microsoft, there's Falcon from McAfee, and there's nothing from Symantec.&quot;&lt;ref name=n360&gt;{{cite web | author=Vivian Yeo | title=Symantec admits it over-hyped Norton 360 | url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/security/0,39044215,39390264,00.htm | work=ZDNet Asia | publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. | date=August 14, 2006 | accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public beta was delivered in November 2006, compatible with Windows XP. A second beta was subsequently released December 20, 2006, adding compatibility for Windows Vista [[Development of Windows Vista#RTM|build 6000]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Symantec challenge to OneCare faces delay | url=http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/security/0,39044215,39362441,00.htm | work=Joris Evers | publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. | date=June 1, 2006 | accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Symantec launches beta of new security program | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2006/11/20/daily40.html?surround=lfn | work=San Jose Business Journal | publisher=American City Business Journals, Inc. | date=November 22, 2006 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 100,000 people tested the software, Symantec began distribution to retailers in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norton 360 to ship next month | url=http://www.itworld.com/070222norton360 | work=Robert McMillan | publisher=The IDG Network | date=February 22, 2007 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 1.0===
[[File:Norton360package.PNG|thumb|alt=Norton 360 version 1.0|Norton 360 version 1.0 [[box art]]]]
Version 1.0 was released on February 26, 2007. This version was the first Symantec product to use [[SONAR (Symantec)|SONAR]] to detect [[zero-day virus]]es. It monitors applications for malicious behavior, taking action as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Symantec unveils SONAR to find zero-day attacks | url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/security-central/symantec-unveils-sonar-find-zero-day-attacks-931| work=Robert McMillan | publisher=Infoworld, Inc. | date=January 17, 2007 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backup and restore functionality allowed users to back up files online or to a [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]], [[Compact Disc|CD]], or [[DVD]]. PC maintenance tools allowed users to clear [[web browser]] history and temporary files. A [[disk defragmenter]] was bundled as part of the PC maintenance tools. Phishing protection integrates with [[Internet Explorer]], warning users of fraudulent sites.

In Windows XP, a 300 [[megahertz]] processor, 256 [[megabyte]]s of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], and 300 MB of [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] space is required. Under Vista, an 800&amp;nbsp;MHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, and 300 MB of hard disk space is required.

Reviews cited Norton 360's low resource usage, relative to [[Norton Internet Security 2007]], and phishing protection. [[PC Magazine]] found the phishing protection feature to be more effective at blocking access to fraudulent sites than [[Internet Explorer 7]] and [[Mozilla Firefox 2|Firefox 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norton 360 | url=http://reviews.cnet.com/internet-security-and-firewall/norton-360/4505-3667_7-32330411.html?tag=mncol;lst | work=Robert Vamosi | publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. | date=February 26, 2007 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norton 360 | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2101130,00.asp | work=Neil J. Rubenking | publisher= PC Magazine | date=March 7, 2007 | accessdate=2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, reviewers highlighted the lack manual control for advanced users. [[CNET Networks|CNET]] noted the lack of phishing protection for browsers other than [[Internet Explorer]], such as [[Mozilla Firefox]]. CNET also highlighted the lack of wireless network tools, such as notifying users when someone uninvited joins the network or help encrypting wireless signals. PC Magazine criticized the spam filtering extension of Version 1.0, finding it blocked only half of the spam mail, and erroneously blocked five percent of the valid mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norton 360 | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2101134,00.asp | work=Robert Vamosi  | publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. | date=February 26, 2007 | accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 2.0===
Version 2.0 was released March 3, 2008. The backup feature can now inscribe data to [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]] discs. Multiple installations of Norton 360 can also  to a centralized location. When backing up files online, the user can control the amount of bandwidth Norton uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2275863,00.asp |title= Norton 360 version 2.0 Tuned Up Tuneup|accessdate=2009-02-27 |work= |publisher=PC Magazine|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A registry cleaner is bundled with the PC maintenance tools, allowing the user to remove invalid entries. Phishing protection for Firefox was added. Supplementing the phishing protection is the Norton Identity Safe, which stores login credentials to websites. A [[network mapping|network map]] allows users to view the status of other Norton installations on networked computers and view basic information about each computer. System requirements remain the same as version 1.0.


PC Magazine found the spam filter to be weak, misidentifying over 25 percent of valid e-mail as spam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norton 360 version 2.0 Updated Add-Ons | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2275866,00.asp | work=Neil J. Rubenking | publisher=PC Magazine| date=March 13, 2008 | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNET encountered problems when installing version 2.0 on legacy machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norton 360 2.0 | url=http://reviews.cnet.com/internet-security-and-firewall/norton-360-2-0/4505-3667_7-32878997.html?tag=rnav | work=Robert Vamosi | publisher=CBS Interactive Inc| date= March 3, 2008 | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 3.0===
[[File:Norton360-3-0 box.jpg|thumb|Norton 360 version 3.0 box art]]
Version 3.0 was released on March 4, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Symantec Releases Norton 360 version 3.0 | url=http://www.channeltimes.com/India/News/Symantec_Releases_Norton_360_version_30/551-100669-1100.html | work=ChannelTimes Staff | publisher=ITNation India Pvt. Ltd | date=April 1, 2009 | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This version uses the same [[codebase]] as [[Norton Internet Security 2009]]. For earlier versions, Symantec rewrote code specifically for Norton 360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Symantec Sends Slimmed-Down Norton 360 to Beta | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2337642,00.asp | work=Neil J. Rubenking | publisher=PC Magazine| date=December 25, 2008 | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 3.0 incorporates [[Norton Safe Web]], offered as a standalone service earlier. Safe Web integrates with Firefox and Internet Explorer as a [[toolbar]], blocking access to fraudulent and malware hosting sites. This toolbar also includes a search box, routing search queries typed in the box through the [[Ask.com]] search engine. The toolbar does not share code with the Ask.com toolbar, which was classified as [[spyware]] by [[McAfee]], [[Trend Micro]], and other [[antivirus software|antivirus]] vendors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ask.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Critics: Ask Jeeves Silently Serves Software | url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/46098.html | work=Jay Lyman | publisher=ECT News Network, Inc | date=September 13, 2005 | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to criticism of the search functionality, Symantec announced the Ask.com search box would be hidden in future releases of version 3.0.&lt;ref name=&quot;ask.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norton 360 Version 3.0 Blocking Bad Web Sites | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2343099,00.asp | work=Neil J.

The capability to back up files to a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] was introduced in this release. Files stored on a flash drive can be copied to another computer without Norton 360 installed. Norton also creates a [[virtual drive]] in [[Windows Explorer]], allowing users to browse their backup files, stored locally or online. Users can restore individual files using the [[drag-and-drop]] technique. Version 3.0 does not retain previous versions of files and skips files which are open by another program. A startup application manager was included in this release, allowing users to control which programs start at login. To complement the application manager, Norton can measure the impact programs have on login time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Norton 360 Version 3.0 PC Tuneup | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2343101,00.asp | work=Neil J. Rubenking | publisher=PC Magazine| date=March 13, 2009 | accessdate=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PC Magazine'' highlighted version 3.0's weak spam filter, misfiling half of valid mail as spam. ''PC Magazine'' also noted a support session with a Symantec technician who used the [[shareware]] application [[Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware]] to remove malware from a computer, referring to it as an &quot;online Norton program&quot;. Controversy was raised over the fact the technician misleadingly referred to the program as a Symantec product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Symantec Support Gone Rogue | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2342634,00.asp| work=Neil J.

=== Version 4.0 ===
Version 4.0 was released on February 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norton 360 v4 is now available|url=http://community.norton.com/t5/Norton-360/Norton-360-v4-is-now-available/td-p/205021|author=Tony Weiss|publisher=[[Symantec]]|accessdate=2010-02-18|date=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version adds many new security features found in [[Norton Internet Security|Norton Internet Security 2010]].&lt;ref name=&quot;V4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2359926,00.asp|title=Norton 360 Version 4.0|publisher=[[PC Mag]]|author=Neil J. Rubenking|date=2010-02-17|accessdate=2010-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 4 also features a GUI change.  The prominent colors now match the gold and black sunburst of [[Norton Internet Security]]. Also, the weak SPAM filter has been replaced with the far more effective Symantec BrightMail, which according to Symantec gives 20% better results and require no training.&lt;ref&gt;Symantec uses BrightMail to filter out SPAM with Norton 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;V4&quot; /&gt;

=== Version 5.0 ===
The newest version of Norton 360 (V5) is now available. It was released in February 2011 and offers improved performance and virus detection. It also provides updated versions of SONAR (version 3) and System insight. Download Insight now not only supports Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers only, but also supports the following clients: QQ (Chat), MSN Messenger (Chat), Limewire (P2P), MSN Explorer (Browser, E-mail &amp; Chat), Opera (Browser),Outlook (E-mail), Thunderbird (E-mail), Windows Mail (E-mail), Chrome (Browser), BitTorrent (P2P), AOL (Browser), Yahoo Messenger (Chat), Safari (Browser), FileZilla (File Manager), Outlook Express (E-mail).

It features a new and enhanced interface with more realistic icons and animations and it also includes Norton Widgets - a platform that integrates other Symantec online services directly in the UI. Also new for this version are Reputation scan, that gives the user clear insight of the loaded applications and files and the Safeweb for Facebook, which scans the links on the wall to verify their safety. Links to Norton Recovery Tools have been added in the scanner's interface and in the start menu folder to help in restoring a highly-infected system. The backup and restore functionality has also been improved. [http://www.passmark.com/benchmark-reports/images/pdf-report.png Passmark performance test 011] rated Norton 360 5.0 as the fastest and lightest all-in-one suite.

=== Version 6.0 ===

Version 6 is likely to be out in beta sometime in October or November 2011, assuming Symantec follows the last year's schedule. It is highly likely to include everything from [[Norton Internet Security#Version 2012 (19.0)|Norton Internet Security 2012]] and it may also include changes in the backup and tuneup functionalities. Screenshots of the first Private Beta were leaked, [http://malwaretips.com/Thread-Norton-360-Version-6-BETA-First-Screenshots Norton 360 v.6 first look], showing that the Interface is currently very similar to version 5, it may however receive a complete refresh before release. An official release of January 2012 is likely.

==Norton vs. others==
===Performance and protection capabilites===
From 2009 to 2012 series, Symantec makes a huge change in product's speed and performance. Norton products now have only 2 running processes, using about 15 mb of RAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.passmark.com/ftp/antivirus_12-performance-testing-ed1.pdf |title=2012 Consumer Security Products Performance Benchmarks (Edition 1) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [http://www.passmark.com/ftp/antivirus_12-performance-testing-ed1.pdf PassMark Security Benchmark 2012] Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security are the lightest suites available. Av-comparatives.org also tested these products and give similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://av-comparatives.org/images/stories/test/performance/performance_aug_2011.pdf |title=Performance Test Internet Security Suites - July 2011 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages of older versions before 3.0==
===FBI cooperation===

Symantec, in compliance with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], whitelisted [[Magic Lantern (software)|Magic Lantern]], a [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] developed by the FBI. The purpose of Magic Lantern is to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail as part of a criminal investigation. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by [[Bob Sullivan (journalist)|Bob Sullivan]] of [[MSNBC]] on  November 20, 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Bridis. &quot;FBI Develops Eavesdropping Tools,&quot; [[Washington Post]], November 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Magic Lantern is deployed as an [[e-mail attachment]]. When the attachment is opened, a [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] is installed on the suspect's computer. The trojan horse is activated when the suspect uses [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] encryption, often used to increase the security of sent e-mail messages. When activated, the trojan horse will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/library/weekly/aa121401a.htm |title=FBI Has a Magic Lantern |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=25471 |title=The FBI's Magic Lantern |publisher=Worldnetdaily.com |date=2001-11-28 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted Magic Lantern, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton Internet Security, incapable of detecting Magic Lantern. Concerns include uncertainties about Magic Lantern's full potential and whether hackers could subvert it for purposes outside the jurisdiction of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utopia.csis.pace.edu/dps/2007/jkile/2005%20-%20Spring/DCS823/Spyware/01016895.pdf |title=Invasive Software: Who's Inside Your Computer? |accessdate=2009-03-12 |work=George Lawton |publisher= |date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The FBI's &quot;Magic Lantern&quot; Shines Bright | url=http://www.kaspersky.com/news?id=266 | work= | publisher=Kaspersky Lab | date=11 Dec 2001| accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham Cluley, a technology consultant from [[Sophos]], said &quot;We have no way of knowing if it was written by the FBI, and even if we did, we wouldnât know whether it was being used by the FBI or if it had been commandeered by a third party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=William |url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/17572-1.html |title=Antivirus vendors are wary of FBI's Magic Lantern |publisher=1105 Media, Inc. |date=2001-12-06 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reaction came from Marc Maiffret, [[chief technical officer]] and cofounder of [[eEye Digital Security]], &quot;Our customers are paying us for a service, to protect them from all forms of malicious code.

===Uninstallation===

Norton Internet Security (Windows versions) is criticized for not [[uninstalling]] completely, leaving unnecessary files and [[Windows Registry|registry]] entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windowssecrets.com/2008/02/07/01-Symantec-uninstaller-may-not-finish-the-job |title=Symantec uninstaller may not finish the job |accessdate=2009-03-05 |work=Scott Dunn |publisher=WindowsSecrets.com |date=February 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askdavetaylor.com/how_can_i_fully_remove_norton_antivirus_from_my_system.html |title=How can I fully remove Norton Antivirus from my system? |publisher=Dave Taylor |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Versions prior to 3.0 also installed a separate [[Norton LiveUpdate|LiveUpdate]] program, which updates Norton-branded software. The user must uninstall both Norton Internet Security and the LiveUpdate component manually. The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton-branded products, if present. Symantec has developed the [[Norton Removal Tool]] to remove [[Windows Registry|registry]] keys and values along with files and folders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://service1.symantec.com/SUPPORT/tsgeninfo.nsf/docid/2005033108162039 |title=Download and run the Norton Removal Tool |publisher=Symantec Corporation |date= |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uninstaller must be run twice. Once, then again after a computer restart, requiring a second restart. Uninstallation will not remove subscription data, preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies.

===Windows Service Packs===

When Norton 360 version 2.0 is installed, users have encountered incompatibilities upgrading to [[Windows XP Service Pack 3]] or [[Windows Vista Service Pack 1]]. Users report numerous invalid [[Windows Registry]] keys being added by a tool named fixcss.exe, resulting in an empty Device Manager and missing devices such as wireless network adapters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sym&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=FAQ: Upgrading to Windows XP Service Pack 3 or Windows Vista Service Pack 1 with your Norton 2008 product installed | url=http://solutions.symantec.com/sdccommon/asp/symcu_defcontent_view.asp?sprt_cid=b32555cd-1b26-4041-abac-882faf8d365f | work= | publisher=Symantec Corporation | date= 8/4/2008 | accessdate=2009-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;windowssecrets1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date= May 29, 2008 |url=http://windowssecrets.com/2008/05/29/02-Norton-software-conflicts-with-Windows-XP-SP3 |title=Norton software conflicts with Windows XP SP3 |publisher=Windowssecrets.com |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symantec initially blamed Microsoft for the incompatibilities but has since accepted partial responsibility.

Dave Cole, senior director of product management, acknowledged that users running Norton products were experiencing problems, but said the numbers are small. Cole also said that Symantec had done &quot;extensive testing&quot; of its products with Windows XP SP3, but this issue was not encountered. Cole blamed Microsoft &quot;This is related to XP SP3.&quot; Microsoft recommended for users to contact Windows customer support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregg&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9088598/|title=Symantec pins blame for XP SP3 registry corruption on Microsoft |publisher=Computerworld Inc. |author=Gregg Keizer |date=2008-05-23 |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; To resolve the problem, Symantec has issued a fix intended for users before upgrading.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sym&quot;/&gt; Symantec also recommends disabling the tamper protection component in the 2008 release, dubbed SymProtect.&lt;ref name=&quot;windowssecrets1&quot;/&gt; A tool to remove the added registry entries is available from Symantec.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sym&quot;/&gt;

===Windows Vista===

Sarah Hicks, Symantec's vice president of consumer product management, voiced concern over Windows Vista 64-bit's [[Kernel Patch Protection|PatchGuard]] feature. PatchGuard was designed by Microsoft to ensure the integrity of the [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]], a part of an [[operating system]] which interacts with the hardware. [[Rootkit]]s may hide in a operating system's kernel, complicating removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ericuday.googlepages.com/EKumar_Rootkits.pdf |title=Battle with the UnseenâUnderstanding Rootkits on Windows|accessdate=2009-03-15 |work=Eric Uday Kumar |publisher=Association of Anti-Virus Asia Researchers |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Dalton, European president of [[McAfee]] said, &quot;The decision to build a wall around the kernel with the assumption it can't be breached is ridiculous&quot;, claiming Microsoft was preventing security vendors from effectively protecting the kernel while promoting its own security product, [[Windows Live OneCare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Vista-PatchGuard-Hacked-37979.shtml |title=Vista PatchGuard Hacked |accessdate=2009-03-11 |work=Marius Oiaga |publisher=Softpedia |date=October 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hicks said Symantec did not mind the competition from OneCare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/2006/10/05/symantec-virus-microsoft-tech-cx_ll_1006symantec.html |title=Symantec Snaps At Microsoft |accessdate=2009-03-11 |work=Lisa Lerer |publisher=Forbes.com LLC |date=October 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symantec later published a white paper detailing PatchGuard with instructions to obtain a PatchGuard exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/reference/Security_Implications_of_Windows_Vista.pdf |title=Security Implications of Windows Vista|accessdate=2009-03-11 |work= |publisher=Symantec Corporation |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Symantec-Vista-White-Paper-Links-to-PatchGuard-Crack/1172700498 |title=Symantec Vista White Paper Links to PatchGuard Crack |accessdate=2009-03-11 |work= Scott M.

=== Subscription Expiration ===

Norton 360 comes with a one year subscription which is activated upon installation, and is valid for three home computers. Expiration of the subscription not only blocks access to program updates but shuts down the antivirus and the firewall as well. All other program features can no longer be accessed as well. For example,the bundled password manager cannot be accessed, locking the user out of the internet password database he or she created and stored on his or her own computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Subani | first=Hamad | title=Buying Norton 360?
