'''Jeffrey Linton Osborne''' (born March 9, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[funk music|funk]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] [[musician]], [[songwriter]], [[lyricist]], and former lead singer of the [[musical ensemble|band]], [[L.T.D.]]

==Early life and career==
Osborne was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. He is the youngest of 12 children and is part of a musical family. He has five brothers and six sisters, some of whom went on to have music careers (his brother Billy was an L.T.D. bandmate). Osborne's father, Clarence &quot;Legs&quot; Osborne, was a popular [[trumpet]]er who played with [[Lionel Hampton]], [[Count Basie]], and [[Duke Ellington]] and died when Osborne was thirteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/osborne_jeffrey/bio.jhtml VH1.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne started his music career in 1970 with a band called Love Men Ltd., who would later become known as L.T.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.last.fm/music/Jeffrey+Osborne Last.fm]&lt;/ref&gt; The band recorded [[hit single]]s such as &quot;[[(Every Time I Turn Around) Back in Love Again]]&quot;, &quot;Concentrate on You,&quot; &quot;[[Love Ballad (L.T.D. song)|Love Ballad]]&quot; and &quot;[[Holding On (When Love Is Gone)]]&quot;. At first, Osborne was a drummer, sharing lead vocal duties with his brother Billy, but by 1978 he became the group's primary lead vocalist.  He and Billy both left L.T.D. in late 1980 to start [[solo (music)|solo]] careers. His solo success includes five [[music recording sales certification|gold]] and [[music recording sales certification|platinum]] albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1.com&quot;/&gt;

==Solo career==
In 1982, Osborne released his self-titled debut [[album]], which featured two hit singles, &quot;On the Wings of Love&quot; and &quot;I Really Don't Need No Light&quot;, peaking at #29 &amp; #39 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|pop chart]] respectively.  This was followed up the next year by ''Stay with Me Tonight'', his first gold album (later reaching platinum album status), which spawned two more hits, &quot;Don't You Get So Mad&quot; (#25) and the title track (#30). &quot;Stay with Me Tonight&quot; (April 1984, #18) and &quot;On the Wings of Love&quot; (June 1984, #11) reach the [[UK Singles Chart]].

In 1985, he wrote the [[lyrics]] to the [[Whitney Houston]] hit &quot;All at Once&quot; (music by [[Michael Masser]]). He appeared on [[USA for Africa]]'s fundraising single, &quot;[[We Are the World]]&quot; in 1985.  He would later appear on ''[[Celebrity Duets]]'' in 2006, performing &quot;On The Wings Of Love&quot; with [[Alfonso Ribeiro]]. Osborne lent his vocals to the theme song of the [[soap opera]], ''[[Loving (TV series)|Loving]]'', from 1992 to 1995&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1.com&quot;/&gt; as well as the first season theme song for the [[Kirstie Alley]] comedy ''[[Veronica's Closet]]''

Osborne had two more gold albums, ''Don't Stop'' and ''Emotional'', the latter of which had his highest [[record chart|charting]] solo [[pop music|pop]] hit, &quot;[[You Should Be Mine (The Woo Woo Song)]]&quot;, which peaked at #13 in 1986. 

The following year, Osborne had the highest-charting hit of his career [[duet (music)|duetting]] with [[Dionne Warwick]] on &quot;Love Power&quot;, which reached #12 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and also topped the [[Adult Contemporary]] singles chart. This was a turning point in his pop success, as his albums and singles began charting lower and lower on the pop charts. Osborne's 1988 single &quot;She's on the Left&quot; would be his final Hot 100 entry, as well as his only #1 R&amp;B hit.

After scoring two more substantial R&amp;B hits in the early 1990s, &quot;Only Human&quot; and &quot;If My Brother's in Trouble&quot;, Osborne would be absent from the charts for the remainder of the decade. 

In the new millennium, he returned with a series of albums that, while far from the success he enjoyed in the 1980s, returned him to Adult R&amp;B radio, scoring modest chart singles such as &quot;Rest of Our Lives&quot; (#75, 2003) and his cover of [[Barbara Mason]]'s classic &quot;[[Yes, I'm Ready]]&quot; (#64, 2005).

In 2008, Osborne sang the [[The Star Spangled Banner|national anthem]] before Game 4 of the [[2008 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], a feat which he repeated in 2009, before Game 1 of the 2009 NBA Finals, and also again in 2010 before Game 1 of the NBA Finals, all at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. He also performed the national anthem prior to Game 3 of the [[1988 World Series]], a feat he repeated two years later at Game 3 of the [[1990 World Series]], both at the [[Oakland Alameda County Coliseum]] in [[Oakland, California]].  He also regularly sang the national anthem before [[Hartford Whalers]] games.

On March 1, 2010, Osborne appeared on ''[[The Bachelor: On the Wings of Love]]'' season finale, &quot;After the Final Rose&quot;, singing his hit &quot;On the Wings of Love&quot; while Bachelor [[Jake Pavelka]] took to the dance floor with his newly announced fiance, Vienna Girardi.
