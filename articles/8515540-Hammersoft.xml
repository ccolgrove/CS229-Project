Over 140 million copies of her books are in print throughout the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;pubweekly&quot;/&gt; and four have become made-for-TV-movies.&lt;ref name=&quot;cockburn&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Cockburn | first = Catherine| coauthors = | title = Debbie Macomber: the interview | publisher = The Romance Writers of Australia | year = 2006 | url =http://www.romanceaustralia.com/interviews/2006debbiemacomber.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830111241/http://www.romanceaustralia.com/interviews/2006debbiemacomber.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macomber was the inaugural winner of the fan-voted Quill Award for romance in 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;munro&quot;/&gt; and has been awarded both a [[Romance Writers of America]] RITA and a lifetime achievement award by the Romance Writers of America.&lt;ref name=&quot;eharlequin&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Debbie Macomber | publisher = eHarlequin.Com | date = | url =http://www.eharlequin.com/author.html?authorid=130 | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Breaking into Publishing===
Although Debbie Macomber is [[Dyslexia|dyslexic]] and has only a high school education, she was determined to be a writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot;/&gt; A stay-at-home mother raising four small children, Macomber nonetheless found the time to sit in her kitchen in front of a rented typewriter and work on developing her first few manuscripts.&lt;ref name=&quot;arr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = Barbara| coauthors = | title = ARR Interview with Debbie Macomber| publisher = A Romance Review | year = 2005 | url =http://www.aromancereview.com/interviews/debbiemacomber.phtml | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For five years she continued to write despite many rejections from publishers, finally turning to freelance magazine work to help her family make ends meet.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Dinsmore | first = Jeffrey | title = Meet the Writers: Debbie Macomber| publisher = Barnes and Noble | date = Spring 2005 | url =http://www.barnesandnoble.com/writers/writerdetails.asp?z=y&amp;cid=1020005 | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With money that she saved from her freelance articles, Macomber attended a romance writer's conference, where one of her manuscripts was selected to be publicly critiqued by an editor from [[Harlequin Enterprises Ltd]]. The editor tore apart her novel and recommended that she throw it away. Undaunted, Macomber scraped together $10 to mail the same novel, ''Heartsong'', to Harlequin's rival, Silhouette Books. Silhouette bought the book, which became the first romance novel to be reviewed by ''Publishers Weekly.''&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot;/&gt;

===Career===
Although ''Heartsong'' was the first of her manuscripts to sell, ''Starlight'' was the first of her novels to be published. It became #128 of the Silhouette Special Edition category romance line (which is now owned by Harlequin).&lt;ref name=&quot;pubweekly&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Donahue | first = Dick| last2 = Coffey|first2=Michael| title = How They Do Debbie | newspaper = Publishers Weekly | date = June 19, 2006 | url =http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6344654.html | accessdate = 2007-04-16 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macomber continued to write category romances for Silhouette, and later Harlequin. In 1988, Harlequin asked Macomber to write a series of interconnected stories, which became known as the Navy series. Before long, she was selling &quot;huge&quot; numbers of books, usually 150,000 copies of each of her novels, and she was releasing two or three titles per year. By 1994, Harlequin launched the Mira Books imprint to help their category romance authors transition to the single title market, and Macomber began releasing single-title novels. Her first hardcover was released in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubweekly&quot;/&gt;

In 2002, Macomber realized that she was having more difficulty identifying with a 25-year-old heroine, and that she wanted to write books focusing more on women and their friendships. ''Thursdays at Eight'' was her first departure from the traditional romance novel and into contemporary women's fiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;bn&quot;/&gt;

Since 1986, in most years Macomber has released a [[Christmas]]-themed book or novella. For several years, these novels were part of the Angel series, following the antics of angels Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy. Macomber, who loves Christmas, says that she writes Christmas books as well because &quot;Every woman I know has a picture of the perfect Christmas in her mind, the same way we do romance. Reality rarely lives up to our expectations, so the best we can do is delve into a fantasy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;huseby&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Huseby | first = Sandy | title =Q&amp;A: Macomber's high-flying romance | publisher = BookPage | year = 2005 | url =http://www.bookpage.com/0512bp/debbie_macomber.html | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Macomber's novels focus on delivering the message of the story and do not include detailed descriptive passages. Her heroines tend to be optimists, and the &quot;stories are resolved in a manner that leaves the reader with a feeling of hope and happy expectation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;huseby&quot;/&gt; Many of the novels take place in small, rural town, with her Cedar Cove series loosely based on her own hometown.&lt;ref name=&quot;green&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Green | first = Tara| coauthors = | title = Interview with Debbie Macomber| publisher = Contemporary Romance Writers |date=October 22, 2003 | url =http://www.contemporaryromancewriters.com/Interview.cfm?InterviewID=33 | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her [[Christian]] beliefs, Macomber does not include overly explicit sexual details in her books, although they do contain some sensuality.&lt;ref name=&quot;neal&quot;&gt;

Over 140 million copies of her books are in print throughout the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubweekly&quot;/&gt; ''This Matter of Marriage'', became a [[Television movie|made-for-tv-movie]] in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;cockburn&quot;/&gt; In 2009, Hallmark Channel broadcast &quot;Debbie Macomber's Mrs. Miracle,&quot; their top-watched movie of the year. The next year Hallmark Channel aired &quot;Call Me Mrs. Miracle,&quot; based on Debbie's novel of the same name, and it was the channel's highest rated movie of 2010. This year, Hallmark Channel plans to premiere &quot;Trading Christmas,&quot; based on Debbie's novel &quot;When Christmas Comes&quot; (released in 2004), on November 26, the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend.

Debbie also now writes inspirational non-fiction. Her second cookbook, &quot;Debbie Macomber's Christmas Cookbook,&quot; and her second children's book, &quot;The Yippy, Yappy Yorkie in the Green Doggy Sweater&quot; (written with Mary Lou Carney), will be released by the end of 2011. There is also a Debbie Macomber line of knitting pattern books from Leisure Arts and she owns her own yarn store, A Good Yarn, in Port Orchard, Washington.

===Recognition===
Macomber is a three-time winner of the [[B. Dalton]] Award,&lt;ref name=&quot;eharlequin&quot;/&gt; and the inaugural winner of the fan-voted Quill Award for romance (2005, for ''44 Cranberry Point'').&lt;ref name=&quot;munro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Munro | first = Aria C. | title = Debbie Macomber Wins First Annual Quill Award for Romance Category| publisher = Publishers Newswire |date=October 13, 2005| url =http://www.publishersnewswire.com/news/2005-10-1013-PNW001.shtml | accessdate = 2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been awarded the ''Romantic Times Magazine'' Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award and has won a [[Romance Writers of America]] RITA Award, the romance novelist's equivalent of an [[Academy Award]], for ''The Christmas Basket''. Her novels have regularly appeared on the [[Waldenbooks]] and ''[[USAToday]]'' bestseller lists and have also earned spots on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]]. On September 6, 2007 she made Harlequin Enterprises history, by pulling off the rarest of triple playsâhaving her new novel, 74 Seaside Avenue, appear at the #1 position for paperback fiction on the [[New York Times]], ''[[USAToday]]'' and ''Publishers Weekly'' bestseller lists. These three highly respected bestseller lists are considered the bellwethers for a book's performance in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;eharlequin&quot;/&gt;

She threw out the first pitch in a Seattle Mariners game at Safeco Field in 2007. The Romance Writers of America presented Debbie with their prestigious Nora Roberts

===Personal===
Macomber is a volunteer mentor for young people, and is active in fundraising for [[Women's shelter|battered women's shelters]] and for literacy and medical research. She is also a national board member for Warm-Up America,&lt;ref name=&quot;pubweekly&quot;/&gt; and was appointed an ambassador for the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America]] national office in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;eharlequin&quot;/&gt; 

Debbie and her husband, Wayne, raised four children and have numerous grandchildren. They live in [[Port Orchard, Washington]] and winter in Florida. When not writing, she enjoys knitting, traveling with Wayne and putting on Grandma Camps for her grandchildren, for whom she has built a four-star tree house behind her home in Port Orchard.

On August 11, 2011, her youngest son, Dale Wayne Macomber, (age 36) was found dead near his house in Washington State by his brother Ted and local police. Having suffered from depression for years, Dale Macomber had threatened suicide and was declared missing August 9, 2011.
