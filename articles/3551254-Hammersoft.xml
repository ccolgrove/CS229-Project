'''James Walter &quot;Jamie&quot; Morris''' (born June 6, 1965) is a former professional [[American football]] [[running back]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Washington Redskins]] and a record-setting running back in [[college football|college]] for the [[University of Michigan]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Wolverines]].  While attending the Michigan, he broke the school's all-time records for [[rush (American football)|rushing]] yards in a season and in a career and for all-purpose yards in a career.  His career rushing total was once third in [[Big Ten Conference]] history.  He continues to hold the career [[reception (American football)|receptions]] record for Michigan running backs.  He also still holds the all-time NFL record for most rushing attempts in a game with 45.

==Early life==
Morris is from [[Ayer, Massachusetts]] where he excelled in [[track and field]] in high school, winning the Massachusetts state title in the [[200m]] as a sophomore.

Morris is the younger brother of [[Joe Morris (Football Player)|Joe Morris]] who set the all-time rushing record at [[Syracuse Orange|Syracuse University]] and went on to play for the [[New York Giants]]. Jamie and Joe and two brothers and two sisters grew up in Ayer.  Their father, Earl Morris, a former [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Beret]] [[master sergeant]] in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], was a [[postmaster]] in [[Groton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=NYTJM&gt;{{cite news|author=White, Gordon S.|title=''Rose Bowl: Added incentive for one Morris''|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=1987-01-01|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3D6113CF932A35752C0A961948260|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College football at Michigan==
===Michigan's all-time leader in all-purpose yards===
Morris played [[college football]] at the [[University of Michigan]] from 1984 to 1987 and broke the school's all-time rushing records in yards gained in a season (1,703 yards) and a career (4,392 yards).  Though those records were broken 13 years later by [[Anthony Thomas (American football)|Anthony Thomas]], Morris still holds the U-M school record for all-purpose yards with 6,201.  Morris was also the only player in Michigan history to lead the Wolverines in rushing for four years until [[Mike Hart (American football)|Mike Hart]] did so from [[2004 NCAA Division I-A football season|2004]]&amp;ndash;[[2007 NCAA Division I-A football season|2007]].&lt;ref name=TWSWBCJM/&gt;  In addition to his rushing yards, he had 99 receptions for 756 yards and 51 [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] returns for 1,027 yards.  He ranks fourth in U-M history in [[Kickoff returner|kickoff return]] yards.&lt;ref name=TWSWBCJM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thosewhostaywillbechampions.blogspot.com/2006/07/jamie-morris-all-purpose-yardage.html|title=Jamie Morris: All-Purpose yardage leader|publisher=Those Who Stay Will Be Champions|date=2006-07-17|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also still ranks third in U-M history in rushing yards in a season and career.  Morris was setting Michigan records during the same years [[Lorenzo White]], the Big Ten's first 2000-yard rusher, was totaling 4,887&amp;nbsp;yards for the [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State Spartans]].  Neither reached [[Archie Griffin]]'s 5,589&amp;nbsp;yard total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/big10/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2007bigtenfbguide.pdf|accessdate=2008-01-25|title=Big Ten Football: Individual Records (All Games)|publisher=The Big Ten Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris was a very versatile running back who was the first Michigan back to total over 30 receptions in a season and remains the only back to have done so twice.  He continues to hold the career receptions record for running backs with 99.&lt;ref name=RB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/document_file/fbl-2007spring-records1.pdf|title=Record Book|accessdate=2008-01-25|year=2007|publisher=University of Michigan &amp; Host Interactive |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080229173113/http://www.mgoblue.com/document_file/fbl-2007spring-records1.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Morris suffered a knee injury in a game against [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]].  He sat out a game and then came back to play against [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].  While he recuperated [[Thomas Wilcher]] rushed for 74&amp;nbsp;yards and two touchdowns against [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]].  When Morris returned, he had the best game of his college career against the Buckeyes, gaining 210 yards rushing (302 all-purpose yards) to help the Wolverines win the game and advance to the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]].&lt;ref name=NYTJM/&gt;  The Wolverines lost the 1987 Rose Bowl to [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]] 22-15. 

Morris also holds the record for the longest run in [[Outback Bowl]] historyâa 77-yard touchdown run on January 2, 1988 in a 28-24 victory over [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outbackbowl.com/facts/individual.html|title=Outback Bowl records|publisher=The Outback Bowl|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris was named MVP of the [[1988 Hall of Fame Bowl|game]], then known as the Hall of Fame Bowl.

===Relationship with Coach Schembechler===

Morris played at Michigan under Coach [[Bo Schembechler]].  When Morris first arrived at Michigan, Coach Schembechler told Morris (who stood five feet, seven inches) he was too short to play at running back.  Schembechler recalled: &quot;I told Jamie when we recruited him he was too small to be a running back and we wanted him for running back kicks. I did, however, promise him the chance to try to be a running back for us. Good thing I did, isn't it?&quot; &lt;ref name=NYTJM/&gt; In his third game as a freshman, Schembechler put him in as the starting tailback, and he remained Michigan's starter at the position for four years.&lt;ref name=NYTJM/&gt;

When asked years later about Morris' career at Michigan, Schembechler said: &quot;Here's a kid who I thought would be a very fine kick-return specialist, and he ended up becoming the all-time leading ground-gainer in Michigan history.  What do you know about that?&quot;&lt;ref name=JBTFMS&gt;{{cite book|author=Brandstatter, Jim|title=Tales from Michigan Stadium, pp. 17-18|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nzi35Oau2G0C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22jamie+morris%22+harbaugh&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7WCWDOPnJX&amp;sig=pz5ZFP08za3IzpuyPMdHp5fjxE0|publisher=Sports Publishing|year=2002|accessdate=2007-12-06 | isbn=9781582613536}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In a  November 2007 interview with ''[[The Ann Arbor News]]'', Morris recalled: &quot;Once Coach Bo was chastising me, and (assistant coach [[Lloyd Carr]]) pointed out, 'Look at those younger players over there.  He's not yelling at them, so he must think something about you.' And that held with me for a long time.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamie Morris Interview|url=http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews_multimedia/2007/11/jamie_morris_interview.html|publisher=[[Ann Arbor News]]|year=2007|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morris also spoke at the memorial service held at [[Michigan Stadium]] after Schembechler's death in November 2006.  While the majority of the speeches focused on how Schembechler will be remembered, Morris spoke about the things he will miss in his coach's absence.  &quot;I will miss having the conversations with him about the good old days,&quot; he said. &quot;Most importantly, I will miss hearing how much love and pride he had for Michigan - the school, the players and the fans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reid, Andy and Herring, Chris|title=''Bo will always be here: Thousands attend memorial at Big House''|publisher=[[The Michigan Daily]]|date=2006-11-22|url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2006/11/22/CampusLife/bo.Will.Always.Be.Here-2506541.shtml|accessdate=2007-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFL career==
Despite setting Michigan's all-time rushing records, Morris' small size (5 feet, 7&amp;nbsp;inches) led to his not being selected until the fourth round of the [[1988 NFL Draft]] by the [[Washington Redskins]].  He played three seasons from [[1988 NFL season|1988]]-[[1990 NFL season|1990]].  His best year was 1988 when he played in all 16 games for the Redskins, and rushed for 437 yards in 126 attempts.  During his career, Morris twice rushed for at least 100&amp;nbsp;yards in a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MorrJa00_biggames.htm|title=Jamie Morris (big games)|accessdate=2008-01-24|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|work=Pro-Football-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Morris also set the NFL record for the most rushing attempts in a game with 45, in a December 17, 1988 game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  The Redskins' web site describes Morris' record-setting performance as follows: &quot;On the morning of Dec. 17, the Redskins had a 7-8 record coming into the season finale at Cincinnati. ... With no hope of returning to the playoffs, the Redskins gave Morris what amounted to an audition for the starting job in 1989. With only 81 carries and 285 yards for the season, the 5-7, 195-pound running back was ready for the challenge. Not only did he carry the ball a record number of times, he gained 152 yards, didn't fumble, and had the Redskins on the brink of victory in a game in which not many experts gave them a chance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Krauss, Andy|url=http://www.redskins.com/news/newsDetail.jsp?id=7082|title=Flashback: Morris Set the Bar High|publisher=The Official Site of the Washington Redskins|date=2005-05-15|accessdate=2007-12-06}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the good showing, Morris did not win a starting job in 1989, gaining 336 yards in 124 carries for a 2.7 yard average. Morris' NFL career came to an end in 1990, when he gained only four yards in two carries for the Redskins.

During Morris' NFL career, none of his teams made the playoffs, but the [[1989 NFL season|1989]] Redskins under [[Joe Gibbs]] were 10-6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=WAS&amp;yr=1989&amp;lg=nfl|title=1989 Washington Redskins|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=databaseSports.com|work=databaseFootball.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, Gibbs used a triumvirate of running backs with [[Kelvin Bryant]] gaining 498 yards, [[Timmy Smith]] gaining 470 yards and Morris gaining 437 yards.  That season Morris was the leading Redskin [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]] returner with 21 returns for 413 yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=WAS&amp;yr=1988&amp;lg=nfl|title=1988 Washington Redskins|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=databaseSports.com|work=databaseFootball.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the [[New England Patriots]] in 1990 Morris was one of five return men ([[Sammy Martin]], [[Marvin Allen]], [[Junior Robinson]], and [[Don Overton]]) with at least 10 returns for the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.databasefootball.com/teams/teamyear.htm?tm=NWE&amp;yr=1990&amp;lg=nfl|title=1990 New England Patriots|accessdate=2007-12-10|publisher=databaseSports.com|work=databaseFootball.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life after football==
Morris worked for the University of Michigan Athletic Department as a development manager for a number of years.  He was responsible for helping the school's campaign to raise $100 million by 2008.&lt;ref name=TWSWBCJM/&gt; Morris also hosted the 2005 U-M Football Bust put on by the U-M Club of [[Metro Detroit|Greater Detroit]].  As of 2010, he is no longer employed by the athletic department. Morris works as a Porter/Detailer at Ann Arbor Chrysler Jeep in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is only 1 mile away from [[Michigan Stadium]] where he broke records for the Wolverines, but he's a Spartan fan at heart.  Morris currently also co-hosts a popular Sunday morning sports talk show, with  John U Bacon, on WTKA in Ann Arbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umclubgreaterdetroit.org/events/bust.asp|title=Annual Michigan Football Bust|publisher=University of Michigan Club of Greater Detroit|accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
