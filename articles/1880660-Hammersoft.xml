==Plot==
During the [[Battle of Britain]], in the suburb of [[Finchley]] near [[London]],  Great Britain, the Pevensie children, [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]], [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]], are endangered by an attack of numerous German [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers. They are [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] to the country home of Professor Digory Kirke.

While they are getting used to the house, Lucy discovers a [[wardrobe]] and enters a wintry [[fantasy world]] called [[Narnia]]. She spends a few hours in the home of the [[faun]], [[Mr. Tumnus]], who explains that [[White Witch|Jadis, the White Witch]], cursed Narnia, and it has been winter for one hundred years. If a human is ever encountered, they were to be brought to her. Tumnus likes Lucy and cannot bring himself to kidnap her, so he sends her home. When she returns hardly any time has passed in the normal world, and nobody believes her story since that when they look in the wardrobe, it has a normal wooden back.

A few days later, Edmund follows Lucy into the wardrobe, meeting the White Witch and her [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] [[Ginarrbrik]]. She offers him [[Turkish Delight]] as well as the prospect of becoming king if Edmund brings his brother and sisters to her castle. After she departs Edmund and Lucy meet again and return; Lucy tells Peter and Susan about the experience, but Edmund lies about it. The Professor talks with Peter and Susan; he does not understand why they do not believe Lucy's story and gives them three possible explanations of Lucy's behavior â [[insanity|madness]], dishonesty and sincerity â the others know she is neither mad nor dishonest, so she must be telling the truth.

While running away from the housekeeper after accidentally breaking a window, the four siblings retreat to the wardrobe and enter Narnia. They discover Mr. Tumnus has been taken by the Witch's secret police and meet Mr. and Mrs. Beaver who tell them about [[Aslan]]. According to the beavers Aslan is on the move to take control of Narnia from the Witch. The four must help Aslan and his supporters; it has been [[prophecy|prophesied]] that if two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit in the four thrones, the White Witch's reign would end.

Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch. When he arrives at her castle, she is angry that he did not deliver his siblings. The Witch sends wolves to hunt down the children and the beavers, who barely escape. Edmund is chained in the Witch's dungeon where he meets Tumnus. The Witch demands that Edmund reveal where his siblings are because her police could not find them; Edmund hesitates when Tumnus claims that Edmund does not know anything. The witch tells Mr. Tumnus that Edmund betrayed him, then turns Tumnus to stone.

While Peter, Lucy, Susan and the beavers travel to the Stone Table, they see what they believe to be the White Witch chasing after them, so they hide. It is really [[Father Christmas]], a sign that the Witch's reign is ending. Father Christmas gives Lucy a healing [[cordial (medicine)|cordial]] and a dagger to defend herself with, Susan a bow and arrows and a magical horn that will summon help when blown, and Peter a sword and shield.

Pursued by wolves led by [[Maugrim]], the group crosses a thawing river, leaving the Witch unable to reach them. Arriving at Aslan's camp, the group encounters Aslan, who is revealed as a huge and noble lion. Aslan promises to help Edmund in any way he can. Later, two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan while they are frolicking by the river. When Peter intervenes Maugrim attacks him and Peter kills him with his sword. After some of Aslan's troops follow the other wolf to the witch's camp and rescue Edmund, Peter is knighted by Aslan.

The White Witch journeys to Aslan's camp and asserts her claim to the traitor Edmund, but Aslan secretly offers to sacrifice himself instead. That night, as Lucy and Susan covertly watch, Aslan is killed by the White Witch at the Stone Table. In the morning he is [[resurrection|resurrected]] because &quot;there is a magic deeper still the Witch does not know&quot;. Aslan takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch's castle, where he frees the prisoners that the White Witch turned to stone, forming reinforcements.

Edmund persuades Peter to lead Aslan's Army to fight the White Witch's forces. Because of the White Witch's huge army is much larger than Aslan's (aka Peter's), Peter's army begins losing. To stop the Witch from attacking and killing Peter, Edmund  attacks the White Witch and destroys her wand, but is fatally wounded by the Witch in return. Peter, angered at what the Witch did, fights her. As the Witch fights Peter, Aslan arrives with reinforcements and kills her. After Edmund is revived by Lucy's cordial, the Pevensies become Kings and Queens, staying in Narnia until they are adults.

Fifteen years later, whilst chasing a white stag through the forest, they come to the same forest clearing where the lampost is. Lucy begins to remember, and with Edmund, Susan and Peter following, fights through the trees, where tumble through the coats and out of the wardrobe and return to England, becoming children again. The Professor enters the room and asks what they were doing. Peter replies, &quot;You wouldn't believe us if we told you, sir.&quot; The Professor tosses him the ball that broke the window and replies, &quot;Try me.&quot; Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe, but the Professor tells her he has been trying for years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect to return.

With the exception of [[Tilda Swinton]], who was the first choice to play Jadis, the White Witch,&lt;ref name=&quot;COAD&quot;&gt;{{cite video | title = Chronicles of a Director | medium = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; casting was a long process. Beginning in 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;visualization&quot;&gt;{{cite video | title = Visualizing ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'': The Complete Production Experience | medium = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson went through 2500 audition tapes, met 1800 children and workshopped 400 before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies. Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmmakers comment&quot;&gt;{{cite video | people = Andrew Adamson, Mark Johnson, Roger Ford | title = Commentary | medium = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered she cast him as an extra in a 1998 dramatization of ''[[Cider with Rosie]]''. He quit school to learn all his lines and beat 3000 boys to the role of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Roya Nikkhah | title = William Moseley on Prince Caspian | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2008-07-03 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/07/03/bfnarnia103.xml&amp;page=1 | accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aslan's voice was a contention point. [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] was originally cast in the role on December 9, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Brian Cox Cast as the Voice of Aslan | publisher = NarniaWeb | date = 2004-12-09 | url = http://www.narniaweb.com/news.asp?id=154&amp;dl=1645490 | accessdate = 2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Adamson changed his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Wloszczyna | first = Susan | title = The wonderful world of 'Narnia' SIDEBAR: 'Narnia' nearly ready | work = [[USA Today]] | date = 2005-05-02 | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2005-05-02-narnia_x.htm | accessdate = 2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liam Neeson]] sought out the role,&lt;ref name=&quot;visualization&quot; /&gt; and was announced as the voice on July 17, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Liam Neeson Will Voice Aslan | publisher = NarniaWeb | date = 2005-07-15 | url = http://www.narniaweb.com/news.asp?id=326&amp;dl=3483310 | accessdate = 2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Pre-production===
During the early 1990s, producers [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]] and [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] were planning a film version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Soren Anderson | url= | title=Wholesome fare film proves Hollywood's moral 'cupboard' isn't bare | publisher=[[The News Tribune]] | date=1995-07-16 | accessdate= 2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could not find a space in [[UK|Britain]] to shoot the film during 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Marilyn Beck | coauthors=Stacy Jenel Smith | url= | title=Soundstage space crunch alters filmmaker Marshall's plans | publisher=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] | date=1996-10-18 | accessdate = 2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their plans to set the film in modern times&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty secrets&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Potts | first = Kimberly | title = 20 Secrets about Narnia (Page 2) | publisher = Movies.com | url = http://movies.go.com/narnia/feature?featureid=745671 | accessdate = 2007-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; made [[Douglas Gresham]] oppose the film,&lt;ref name=&quot;horizons&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Fisher | first = Paul | title = Interview: Andrew Adamson &quot;Chronicles of Narnia - Lion, Witch &amp; Wardrobe&quot; | publisher = Dark Horizons | date = 2005-11-21 | url = http://www.darkhorizons.com/news05/narnia2.php | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to his feeling that technology had yet to catch up.&lt;ref name=&quot;twenty secrets&quot; /&gt; [[Perry Moore]] began negotiations with the [[C. S. Lewis]] Estate in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;coverage of narnia&quot; /&gt; On December 7, 2001, Walden Media announced that they had acquired the rights to ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Davidson | first = Paul | title = Move Over, Harry - A Real Fantasy Classic Is Coming to Town | publisher = IGN | date = 2001-12-07 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/316/316765p1.html | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' prompted the producers to feel they could make a faithful adaptation of the novel set in Britain. &quot;''Harry Potter'' came along, and all those cultural or geographical lines were broken,&quot; [[Mark Johnson (producer)|Mark Johnson]] explained. &quot;When ''The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'' was being developed at Paramount, the imperative was to set it in the U.S., and it just doesn't hold. [...] It's not the book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Sam Adams | title = Fantasy films?

In the novel, the battle is never seen until Aslan, Susan, Lucy and their reinforcements arrive. This was changed in the movie because Adamson said he could vividly remember a huge battle,&lt;ref name=&quot;filmmakers comment&quot; /&gt; an example of how Lewis left a lot to the readers' imagination. Other small changes include the reason all four children come to Narnia, in that an accident breaks a window and forces them to hide. Tumnus also never meets Edmund until the end in the novel. Minor details were added to the Pevensies, such as their mother's name, Helen, being the actual first name of Georgie Henley's mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids comment&quot; /&gt; [[Finchley]] as the home of the Pevensies was inspired by Anna Popplewell, who actually is from Finchley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Simon Thompson | title = Popplewell Gives Narnia Sequel Update | publisher=Comingsoon.net | date=2006-07-06 | url = http://comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15280 | accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamson also changed the circumstances in which Lucy first comes into Narnia. He felt it was more natural that she first see the wardrobe while looking for a [[hide-and-seek]] hiding place, rather than just chance upon it exploring the house.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmmakers comment&quot; /&gt; The film also hints at Professor Kirke's role in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', such as the engravings on the wardrobe when it is a simple one in the novel and the Professor's surprise and intrigue when Peter and Susan mentions Lucy's discovery in the wardrobe. When Lewis wrote the novel, it was the first of the series and the back-story later outlined by the subsequent books in the series did not exist. In the novel also, the father of the Pevensie children is in London with their mother, but in the film, their father is fighting in the war as Lucy stated to Mr. Tumnus when they first meet in Narnia.

[[Weta Workshop]] head [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] cited [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' as an inspiration on the film. He felt Narnia had to be less dark and gritty than their depiction of [[Middle-earth]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|The Lord of the Rings]]'' because it is a new world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joanna Cohen|title=Richard Taylor on the Weta Workshop and Prince Caspian|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=2008-12-02|url=http://uk.rottentomatoes.com/m/chronicles_of_narnia_prince_caspian/news/1783975/rt_interview_richard_taylor_on_the_weta_workshop_and_prince_caspian|accessdate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Weta's creature designs were designed for digital creation, so when Howard Berger and KNB FX inherited the practical effects work, they had to spend three months retooling approved designs for animatronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=George Rousch|title=Prince Caspian DVD Interview: Creature Effects Wizard Howard Berger|work=Latino Review|date=2008-12-02|url=http://www.latinoreview.com/news/prince-caspian-dvd-interview-creature-effects-wizard-howard-berger-5780|accessdate=2008-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger's children would comment and advise upon his designs; they suggested the White Witch's hair be changed from black to blonde, which Berger concurred with as he realized Swinton's wig looked too gothic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mike Szymanski|title=More Caspian Clips, Creatures|work=[[SCI FI Wire]]|date=2008-12-03|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=3&amp;id=62501&amp;type=0|accessdate=2008-12-03}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Principal photography began on June 28, 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;diary&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Perry Moore | coauthors = [[Anna Popplewell]], [[Georgie Henley]], [[Andrew Adamson]], Roger Ford, Ben Wooten, [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]], Howard Berger, Dean Wright, [[Douglas Gresham]] | title = The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - The Official Illustrated Movie Companion | publisher = Harpercollins | year = 2005 | pages = 104â113 | isbn = 0-00-720817-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; shooting in primarily chronological order.&lt;ref name=&quot;storytellers&quot; /&gt; Adamson did this in order to naturally create a sense of mature development from his young actors, which mirrored their real life development.&lt;ref name=&quot;horizons&quot; /&gt; [[Georgie Henley]] and [[Skandar Keynes]]&lt;ref name=&quot;visualization&quot;/&gt; were never shown the set before filming scenes of their characters entering Narnia, nor had Henley seen [[James McAvoy]] in his Mr. Tumnus costume before shooting their scenes together.&lt;ref name=&quot;kids comment&quot; /&gt;

The first scene shot was at the disused Hobsonville Air Base for the railway scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Narnia Filming Underway! | publisher = NarniaWeb | date = 2004-06-28 | url = http://www.narniaweb.com/news.asp?id=59&amp;dl=630415 | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, they shot the Blitz scene, which Adamson called their first formal day of shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmmakers comment&quot; /&gt;

The filmmakers asked permission to bring in twelve reindeer to New Zealand to pull the Ice Queen's sled. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry denied, citing the potentially deadly Q fever from which the North American reindeer population suffers as the reason. However, ten wolves and [[wolf hybrid]]s were allowed in for filming in Auckland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Perrott | last = Alan | title = Animatronic reindeer replace living variety in Narnia film | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=200&amp;objectid=3587193

The reindeer were designed with replace-able skins to get the most usage; brown for Father Christmas and white for the White Witch.

The cast and crew spent their time in New Zealand in [[Auckland]] before moving in November to the South Island. The castle scene was filmed in Purakaunui Bay, not far from the most southern point in NZ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | title = The Children's Magical Journey | medium = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | date = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They filmed in [[Czech Republic]] ([[Prague]] and National Park ÄeskÃ© Å vÃ½carsko) and [[Poland]] after the [[Christmas]] break,&lt;ref name=&quot;storytellers&quot; /&gt; before wrapping in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Narnia Shooting Ends | publisher = IGN | date = 2005-02-16 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/588/588270p1.html | accessdate = 2007-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (soundtrack)|Music Inspired by The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe}}

The soundtrack was composed by [[Harry Gregson-Williams]]. Gregson-Williams had previously worked with Adamson on ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001) and ''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004). In addition there are three original songs in the film; ''Can't Take It In'' by [[Imogen Heap]], ''[[Wunderkind (song)|Wunderkind]]'' by [[Alanis Morissette]] and ''Winter Light'' by [[Tim Finn]]. [[Evanescence]] lead singer [[Amy Lee]] also wrote a song entitled ''[[Good Enough (Evanescence song)|Good Enough]]'' for the film, but were not included in the soundtrack. ''Good Enough'' was later included in the band's album entitled ''[[The Open Door]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;blabbermouth&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=29664 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - Film Producers: EVANESCENCE-Penned Score Is Figment Of AMY LEE'S Imagination |work=roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net |first=Blabber |last=Mouth |date=2004-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soundtrack was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]], [[London]], England, and in Los Angeles, CA.
