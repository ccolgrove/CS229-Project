'''Frances de la Tour''' (born 30 July 1944) is an English actress perhaps best known for her role as Miss Ruth Jones in the British sitcom ''[[Rising Damp]]'', and as [[Olympe Maxime|Madame Olympe Maxime]] in the film adaptation of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â Part 1]]''.

==Early life and family==
De la Tour was born in [[Bovingdon]], Hertfordshire,
to Moyra (nÃ©e Fessas) and Charles de la Tour.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; She was educated at London's ''LycÃ©e FranÃ§ais'' and the [[Drama Centre London]], (now a college of the [[University of the Arts London]]). 
 
She is the sister of actor and screenwriter [[Andy de la Tour]], and was briefly married to playwright [[Tom Kempinski]]. She has a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/40/Frances-Tour.html Frances de la Tour Biography] accessed 23 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==RSC and National companies==
On leaving drama school she joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] (RSC) in 1965 where she studied with [[Michel Saint-Denis]]. Over the next six years, she played many small roles with the RSC in a variety of plays, gradually building up to larger parts such as Hoyden in ''[[The Relapse]]'' and culminating in [[Peter Brook]]'s acclaimed production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' in which she played Helena as a comic &quot;tour de force&quot;.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;
In the 1970s, she worked steadily both on the stage and on television. Some of her notable appearances were Rosalind in ''[[As You Like It]]'' at the [[Oxford Playhouse]] in 1975, Isabella in ''[[The White Devil]]'' at the [[Old Vic]] in 1976. She enjoyed a collaboration with [[Stepney]]'s [[Half Moon Theatre]], appearing in the London premiÃ¨re of [[Dario Fo]]'s ''We Can't Pay? We Won't Pay'' (1978), [[Eleanor Marx]]'s ''Landscape of Exile'' (1979), and in the title role of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1980).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

In 1980, she played Stephanie, the violinist with [[multiple sclerosis|MS]] in ''[[Duet for One]]'', a play written for her by Kempinski, for which she won the [[Laurence Olivier Awards|Olivier]] for Best Actress. She played Sonya in ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' opposite [[Donald Sinden]] at the [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] in 1982. Her performance as Josie in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[A Moon for the Misbegotten]]'' won her another Olivier for Best Actress in 1983. She joined the [[Royal National Theatre]] for the title role in ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' in 1984 and appeared there in ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' in 1986. She again won the Olivier for Best Supporting Actress for [[Martin Sherman]]'s play about Isadora Duncan, ''When She Danced'' with [[Vanessa Redgrave]] at the [[Gielgud Theatre|Globe]] (now the Gielgud) Theatre in 1991, Leo in ''[[Les Parents terribles]]'' at the Royal National Theatre in 1994. 

She co-starred with [[Maggie Smith]] in [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Three Tall Women]]'' at the Wyndham's in 1994 and with [[Alan Howard]] in Albee's ''[[The Play About the Baby]]'' at the [[Almeida Theatre|Almeida]] in 1998. In 1999, she returned to the RSC to play Cleopatra opposite [[Alan Bates]] in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' in which she did a [[nude]] walk across the stage. In 2004, she played Mrs Lintott in [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[The History Boys]]'' at the National, later on [[Broadway Theatre|Broadway]] and in the film version (2006). In 2007 she appeared in a West End revival of the farce ''[[Boeing-Boeing (play)|Boeing-Boeing]]''. In 2009 she appeared in [[Alan Bennett]]'s new play ''[[The Habit of Art]]'' at the National.

==Television roles==
Her many television appearances include the 1980 miniseries ''Flickers'' alongside [[Bob Hoskins]], the TV version of ''[[Duet for One]]'', the series ''A Kind of Living'', ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', episodes of ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot|Poirot]]'', ''[[Marple (TV series)|Marple]]'' and ''[[Waking the Dead (TV series)|Waking the Dead]]''. Of all her TV roles, however, she is best known for playing [[spinster]] Ruth Jones in the successful [[Yorkshire Television]] comedy ''[[Rising Damp]]''. De la Tour told Richard Webber, who penned a 2001 book about the series, that Ruth Jones ''&quot;was an interesting character to play. We laughed a lot on set, but comedy is a serious business and Leonard took it particularly seriously, and rightly so. Comedy, which is so much down to timing, is exhausting work. But it was a happy time.&quot;''

In the mid-'80s, de la Tour was considered, along with Joanna Lumley and Dawn French, as a replacement for [[Colin Baker]] in [[Doctor Who]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitaljournal.com/article/298752 |title=Joanna Lumley was set to be the first female Doctor Who |publisher=Digitaljournal.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was scrapped, and the job was given to Sylvester McCoy.

==Recent activity==
In 2003, de la Tour played a terminally ill woman in the film, ''[[Love Actually]]'', although her scenes were cut from the film's theatrical release, and appear only on the DVD. 

In 2005 she played [[Olympe Maxime]], headmistress of Beauxbatons Academy, in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', a role she reprised in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows â Part 1]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harry-potter-movie-buzz.com/news/729/scoop-on-filming-the-deathly-hallows-wedding-scene.html |title=Scoop on Filming the âDeathly Hallowsâ Wedding Scene |publisher=Harry Potter Movie Buzz |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (notable in that her character was not present in the novel). In December 2005 she starred in the London production of the highly acclaimed anti-Iraq-war one-woman play ''Peace Mom'' by [[Dario Fo]], based on the writings of [[Cindy Sheehan]]. 

She won a [[Drama Desk Award]] and a [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play|Tony Award]] in 2006 for her work in ''[[The History Boys]]'' on [[Broadway Theatre|Broadway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyboysonbroadway.com/reviews.php ''The History Boys'']{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was nominated for the 2006 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award for Actress in a Supporting Role for her work on the film version of ''The History Boys''. 

She appeared in Tim Burton's 2010 ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' as Aunt Imogene, a delusional aunt of Alice's, opposite [[Johnny Depp]], [[Anne Hathaway (actress)|Anne Hathaway]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]] and [[Mia Wasikowska]]. Also that year, she had a supporting role in the motion picture ''[[The Book of Eli]]'', directed by the [[Hughes brothers]].

She is also a patron of the performing arts company [[Theatretrain]].
