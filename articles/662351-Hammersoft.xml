The '''2008 UEFA European Football Championship''', commonly referred to as '''Euro 2008''', was the 13th [[UEFA European Football Championship]], a quadrennial [[association football|football]] tournament contested by European nations. It took place in Austria and Switzerland from 7 to 29 June 2008. The second jointly-hosted edition in the competition's history, the tournament was eventually won by [[Spain national football team|Spain]], defeating [[Germany national football team|Germany]] 1â0 in the [[UEFA Euro 2008 Final|final]]; becoming only the second nation to win all their group stage fixtures and win the European Championship itself; an accomplishment matched by France in [[UEFA Euro 1984 Final|1984]]. Spain were also the first team since Germany in [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996]] to win the tournament undefeated.

[[Greece national football team|Greece]] were the defending champions going into the tournament, having won [[UEFA Euro 2004]], the previous competition. They recorded the worst finish in Euro 2008, collecting the least amount of prize money and gaining no points in their three group fixtures. Throughout 31 matches, the participating nations totalled 77 goals, the same as the previous tournament. [[Austria national football team|Austria]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] automatically qualified as hosts; the remaining 14 teams were determined through [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|qualifying matches]], which began in August 2006. As European champions, Spain earned the right to compete for the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]] in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Spain was not obliged to participate in the Confederations Cup, but chose to do so. Prior to 2004, the European and South American champions were obliged to participate in the Confederations Cup, but a FIFA ruling changed this in 2004.&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/federation/releases/newsid=95756.html |title=2005/2006 season: final worldwide matchday to be 14&amp;nbsp;May 2006 |date=19 December 2004 |publisher=[[FIFA]].com |accessdate=14 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Euro 2008.png|thumb|300px|Performance of the participating countries during Euro 2008]]
[[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|Qualification]] for Euro 2008 started in August 2006, just over a month after the end of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. The qualifying tournament was contested by national teams from each of [[UEFA]]'s member associations, with the exceptions of [[Austria national football team|Austria]] and [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], who had automatically qualified for the finals tournament as hosts and [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]], who came into existence too late to be admitted to UEFA. [[England national football team|England]] was the only seeded team not to qualify for the tournament proper, whereas [[Russia national football team|Russia]] was the only unseeded one to qualify.

The draw for the finals tournament took place on 2 December 2007, and saw [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group C|Group C]] immediately labelled as the &quot;[[group of death]]&quot;, with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[France national football team|France]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] competing for the two qualifying places. In contrast, [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] were deemed to have an easy draw, as the tournament structure meant they could not meet Italy, France, the Netherlands or [[Spain national football team|Spain]] until the final.

In the group stage, [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], Spain and the Netherlands all qualified with maximum points. Austria and Switzerland were not expected to progress, despite the advantage of being the hosts. In [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group A|Group A]], the Swiss lost their captain, [[Alexander Frei]], to injury in their first game and became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, after losing their first two matches. Switzerland managed to beat the group winner Portugal in their last game. In [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group B|Group B]], Austria managed to set up a decisive final game against Germany, dubbed &quot;Austria's final&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Germany Advances to Euro 2008 Quarterfinals | publisher=WSN | date = 16 June 2008 | accessdate =17 March 2009 | url=http://www.wsn.com/2008/06/16/football/news/2008-european-championship/germany-advances-to-euro-2008-quarterfinals_343529/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they lost by one goal, making Euro 2008 the first European Championship not to have one of the host nations present in the knockout stage. In an exciting final game in Group A, an injury- and suspension-hit [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] came back from 2â0 down to beat the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] 3â2, after an uncharacteristic handling mistake by [[Petr Äech]], in the last few minutes, left [[Nihat Kahveci]] with the simplest of finishes. In the same game, goalkeeper [[Volkan Demirel]] was shown a red card for pushing Czech striker [[Jan Koller]] to the ground. The Turks joined Portugal as the qualifiers from Group A. France were the high-profile victims of Group C, recording just one point from a goalless draw against Romania in their opening game. Italy beat the French, on the final day, to finish on four points and joining the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. Finally, in [[UEFA Euro 2008 Group D|Group D]], [[Greece national football team|Greece]] failed to reproduce the form of their shock [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004 win]], and ended the tournament with no points. Russia qualified at the expense of [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], after beating them in a final game decider, joining Spain in the knockout stage.

In the quarter-finals, the Portuguese team was unable to give their coach, [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], a fitting send-off â following the mid-tournament announcement that Scolari would be leaving to join English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] â losing in an exciting game against Germany. Turkey continued their streak of last-gasp wins, equalising at the end of extra-time against Croatia and advancing on penalties. Coached by Dutchman [[Guus Hiddink]], Russia eliminated the Netherlands with two extra-time goals. The last quarter-final match saw Spain defeat Italy on penalties, after a goalless draw in regular time.

Turkey's progress was halted by Germany at the semi-final stage. Turkey entered the game with nine of their squad members missing due to injury or suspension, but still scored the first goal. Later, they leveled the score at 2â2, before Germany scored the winning goal in the final minute. The world television feed of the match was intermittently lost during the match, which prevented the broadcast of Germany's second goal. This was due to a thunderstorm at the broadcasting relay station in Austria, despite the game being played in Switzerland. Spain won the second semi-final against Russia by three goals to nil, through second-half goals from [[Xavi]], [[Daniel GÃ¼iza]] and [[David Silva]], earning Spain their first appearance in a major final for 24 years.

[[File:Celebracion Eurocopa 1.jpg|thumb|The Spanish football team touring Madrid as champions]]
In the final, held at [[Vienna]]'s [[Ernst-Happel-Stadion]], Spain became European champions for the second time after [[Fernando Torres]]' first-half goal proved enough to defeat Germany. Though Germany had a strong start, Spain started to look more dangerous after they had settled. After half an hour, Xavi played a pass in behind the Germany back line towards Torres, who outmuscled a hesitant [[Philipp Lahm]] and clipped the ball over the diving [[Jens Lehmann]] and just inside the far post. That goal proved to be the only goal of the game, which Spain dominated despite Germany having the majority of the possession,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/tournament/matches/match=301696/statistics/index.html |title=Match statistics |accessdate=30 June 2008 |date=29 June 2008 |publisher=euro2008.uefa.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain were crowned UEFA Euro 2008 champions.

==Bid process==
Austria and Switzerland jointly bid to host the games, and faced major competition from Greece/Turkey, [[Scotland]]/Republic of Ireland, Russia, Hungary, Croatia/[[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and a 4-way [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] bid from Norway/Sweden/Denmark/Finland. Austria had previously bid to host [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] with Hungary, but they eventually lost out to Portugal.

Austria/Switzerland, Greece/Turkey, and Hungary were recommended before the final vote. Greece and Turkey were rejected and let Hungary and Austria/Switzerland battle for the win.

The Austria/Switzerland bid is the second successful joint bid in the competition's history, following the [[UEFA Euro 2000]] hosted by Belgium and the Netherlands. The [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012 competition]] in Poland and Ukraine is scheduled to become the third jointly-hosted tournament.

==Venues==
The tournament was played at eight venues throughout the two host nations; four in Austria and four in Switzerland. Each venue had a capacity of at least 30,000 for the tournament; the largest stadium was [[Ernst Happel Stadion]] in Vienna with a capacity of 53,295.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fussballtempel.net/em2008/stadien.html |title=UEFA EURO 2008 |accessdate=8 June 2008 |publisher=fussballtempel.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was for this reason that Ernst Happel Stadion hosted the final. Switzerland played all of their group stage matches at [[St. Jakob Park]] in Basel, which also hosted the opening match of the tournament as a compromise for the final being held in Vienna. Austria played all of their group stage matches at [[Ernst Happel Stadion]].

In 2004, the [[Zurich]] venue became a problem for the organisers. Originally, the [[Hardturm]] stadium was to be renovated and used as the city's venue, but legal challenges delayed the plan to a point that would not have allowed the ground to be used in 2008. This created a problem, as the agreement between UEFA and the organizers stipulated that four venues would be used in each country. The problem was solved when the organizers proposed renovating [[Letzigrund]] instead; [[UEFA]] approved the revised plan in January 2005. The Letzigrund stadium hosted its first football match on 23 September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/organisation/venueguide/city=16/newsid=312773.html |title=Zurich â Letzigrund Stadion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifying==
{{main|UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying}}
The draw for the qualifying round took place in [[Montreux]], Switzerland on 27 January 2006 at 12:00 [[Central European Time|CET]].

The qualifying process commenced a month after the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. Austria and Switzerland automatically qualified for the tournament finals as host nations.

The qualifying format was changed compared to previous tournaments. The winners and runners-up from seven groups automatically qualified for the Championship, with the hosts filling the other two slots in the 16-team tournament. The change means there were no [[play-off]]s between teams finishing in second place in the groups â they qualified directly for the finals. Teams that finished in third place didn't have any further opportunity to qualify. Six of the qualifying groups contained seven teams, and the other, [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group A|Group A]], contained eight.

==Seeding==
{{main|UEFA Euro 2008 seeding}}
The draw for the final tournament took place on 2 December 2007 at the ''Culture and Convention Centre'' in [[Lucerne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=631046.html |title=Draw sets up heavyweight contests |publisher=uefa.com |date=2 December 2007 |accessdate=2 December 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071203150109/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=631046.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a return to the format used at [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]] and [[UEFA Euro 96|Euro 96]] the games in each group were held at just two stadia, with the seeded team remaining in the same city for all three matches. As was the case at the 2000 and 2004 finals, the finalists were divided into four [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seeding]] pots, based on average points per game in the qualifying phases of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] and Euro 2008, with each group having one team from each pot. [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]], as co-hosts, and [[Greece national football team|Greece]], as defending champions, were seeded first automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/Format/index.html |title=Format from UEFA Website }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/491990.pdf |title=UEFA Euro 2008 Information |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] were seeded based on their UEFA coefficient in the [[UEFA coefficients#Ranking for Euro 2008 final tournament|Euro 2008 finalists ranking]].

==Squads==
{{main|UEFA Euro 2008 squads}}
Each nation had to submit a squad of 23 players, three of whom had to be goalkeepers, by 28 May 2008. If a player was injured seriously enough to prevent him from taking part in the tournament before his team's first match, he could be replaced by another player.&lt;ref name=&quot;regulations&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/PressConference/Competitions/MediaServices/68/13/42/681342_DOWNLOAD.pdf |title=Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2006/08 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
===Group stage===
====Tie-breaking criteria====
For the three game group stage of this tournament, where two or more teams in a group [[Tiebreaker|tied on an equal number of points]], the finishing positions were determined by the following tie-breaking criteria in the following order:&lt;ref name=&quot;UEFARegulations707&quot;&gt;Paragraph 7.07 (Section V) of [http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19079.pdf Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship, 2006/08]&lt;/ref&gt;
# number of points obtained in the matches among the teams in question
# goal difference in the matches among the teams in question
# number of goals scored in the matches among the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points)
# goal difference in all the group matches
# number of goals scored in all the group matches
# coefficient from the qualifying competitions for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and 2006/08 UEFA European Football Championship (points obtained divided by the number of matches played)
# fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament)
# drawing of lots

However, these criteria would not apply if two teams tied on points and goals scored played against each other in their final group match; in that case, the tie would be broken by a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UEFARegulations708&quot;&gt;Paragraph 7.08 (Section V) of [http://www.uefa.com/newsfiles/19079.pdf Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship, 2006/08]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knockout phase===
{{main|UEFA Euro 2008 knockout stage}}
[[File:Spain Euro 08 celebration 2.jpg|thumb|[[Cesc FÃ bregas]] celebrating Spain's Euro 2008 title]]
The knockout stage was different from that of past tournaments. Teams in groups A and B were separated from teams in groups C and D until the final. This increased the chance of a group fixture being replayed in the knockout stage, and rendered impossible a final between two teams drawn in the same half of the tournament. Also, in another major change, for the first time in a European Championship, only two venues ([[St. Jakob-Park]], [[Basel]] and [[Ernst Happel Stadion]], Viennaâthe two largest of the eight stadiums used) were used for the seven matches in the knockout stage of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news?slug=reu-eurodraw&amp;prov=reuters&amp;type=lgns |title=Euro-Format means group rivals cannot meet again in final |publisher=[[Yahoo!

[[File:Xavi SelecciÃ³n.jpg|thumb|upright|Xavi, Player of the Tournament]]
The UEFA Technical Team was charged with naming a squad composed of the 23 best players over the course of the tournament. The group of nine analysts watched every game at the tournament before making their decision after the final. Nine players from the winning Spanish team were named in the team of the tournament, while no players knocked out in the group stage were included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Spain dominate Team of the Tournament |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=1/newsid=729372.html |publisher=euro2008.uefa.com |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UEFA Technical Team also had to pick a Player of the Tournament, taking fans' votes into account. The player chosen was Spain midfielder [[Xavi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Xavi emerges as EURO's top man |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=1/newsid=729378.html |publisher=euro2008.uefa.com |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Golden Boot was awarded to yet another Spaniard, [[David Villa]], who scored four goals, three of which came in his side's 4â1 win over Russia (the only [[hat-trick]] scored in the tournament).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Absent Villa takes scoring prize |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=1/newsid=728854.html |publisher=euro2008.uefa.com |date=29 June 2008 |accessdate=1 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discipline===
{{main|UEFA Euro 2008 disciplinary record}}

At UEFA Euro 2008, players may be suspended from playing in subsequent matches upon the collection of a certain number of yellow or red cards. If a player is shown a red card â whether as a result of two bookable offences or a straight red â that player is suspended from playing in his team's next match. If his team is eliminated from the competition before the end of his suspension, the games carry over to the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches]]. A player is also suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated are annulled once a team is eliminated from the tournament or reaches the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/multimediafiles/download/regulations/uefa/others/69/90/33/699033_download.pdf |format=PDF|title=Directives on yellow cards in the EURO 2008 competition |accessdate=20 June 2008 |date=11 July 2006 |publisher=UEFA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In extreme cases of ill-discipline, UEFA may choose to have a disciplinary panel examine the incident in order to determine whether or not further suspension is required. One case of this at Euro 2008 was the suspension of [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] goalkeeper [[Volkan Demirel]] for two matches for pushing [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech]] striker [[Jan Koller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Volkan Demirel banned |url=http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/magazine/edition=721617/newsid=721557/ |publisher=euro2008.uefa.com |date=19 June 2008 |accessdate=20 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following players were suspended for one or more games as a result of red cards or yellow card accumulation:

==Miscellany==
===Television coverage failure===
Three times in the second half of the [[UEFA Euro 2008 knockout stage#Germany vs Turkey|semi-final between Germany and Turkey]], nearly the entire global television coverage of the game was interrupted. A thunderstorm over Vienna caused technical difficulties in the [[International Broadcast Centre]] (IBC), which relayed the television feed from the match in Basel, Switzerland, resulting in one or more goals being missed by various audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/7474598.stm |title=Uefa may face action over outage |date=25 June 2008 |accessdate=26 June 2008 |publisher=BBC News  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various national broadcasters took emergency contingency measures such as reverting to radio broadcasting (for example, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] used coverage from [[Radio 5 Live]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/jun/26/bbc.television1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=technologyfull |title=Euro 2008 semi-final thriller hit by TV blackouts |accessdate=26 June 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=UK  | first=Mark | last=Sweney | date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland circumvented the problem by having [[RTÃ Two]]'s studio presenter [[Bill O'Herlihy]] and panelists [[Eamon Dunphy]], [[Johnny Giles]] and [[Liam Brady]] provide emergency discussion on what had happened in the match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/tv-radio/frock-horror-miriam-embraces-her-girly-side-1422476.html |title=Frock horror! Miriam embraces her girly side  |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2008 |publisher=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ãyvind Alsaker]], commentator from [[TV 2 (Norway)|Norwegian TV2]] picked up his mobile and filmed with a [[3G]] camera). Only the Swiss public broadcaster [[SRG SSR idÃ©e suisse|SRG]] maintained full coverage since it used a direct signal other than the IBC's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Pfanner |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/06/26/business/storm.php |title=Euro broadcasters scramble in storm |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=27 June 2008 |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New trophy===
A new trophy was awarded to the winners of the Euro 2008 tournament. The new version of the [[Henri Delaunay]] Trophy, created by [[Asprey]] London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/history/background/trophy/ |title=New trophy announced at UEFA site }}&lt;/ref&gt; is almost an exact replica of the original designed by [[Arthus-Bertrand]]. A small figure juggling a ball on the back of the original has been removed, as has the marble plinth. The silver base of the trophy also had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plinth have now been engraved on the back of the trophy, which is made of [[sterling silver]], weighs {{convert|8|kg|lb|1}} and is {{convert|60|cm|in}} tall.

===Penalty kicks===
Not counting [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shoot-outs]], there were five [[penalty kicks]] awarded during the tournament. For the first time since tournament expansion for [[Euro 96]], no penalties were awarded during the [[UEFA Euro 2008 knockout stage|knockout stage]]. [[Romania national football team|Romanian]] [[Adrian Mutu]] provided the sole penalty miss, late in the match against world champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]]; had he scored and Romania held on for the win, the Italians would have been knocked out.

===Match ball===
[[File:Euro Cup 2008 Final Vienna.JPG|thumb|A large model of the ''adidas Europass'' prior to the final between Germany and Spain]]
The [[Association football ball|match ball]] for the finals was unveiled at the draw ceremony. Produced by [[Adidas]] and named the ''Europass'', it is a 14-panel ball in the same construction as the [[Adidas Teamgeist|Teamgeist]], but with a modified surface design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=adidas &quot;EUROPASS&quot; â the match ball with &quot;goose bumps&quot; for UEFA EURO 2008 |url=http://www.press.adidas.com/DesktopDefault.aspx/tabid-11/16_read-8454/ |publisher=adidas |location=Lucerne/Herzogenaurach |date=2 December 2007 |accessdate=4 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A version named the ''Europass Gloria'' was used in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Final ball rolled out in Vienna |url=http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/news/kind=2097152/newsid=688323.html |publisher=euro2008.uefa.com |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=30 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were concerns raised about the match ball, which was claimed to deviate unpredictably in flight, making it difficult to judge for goalkeepers. Notable players to criticise were Germany's [[Jens Lehmann]] and the Czech Republic's [[Petr Äech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cech concerned by Euro 2008 ball |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2008/czech_republic/7439862.stm |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=6 June 2008 |accessdate=6 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims were disputed by the ball's designer, [[Oliver Kahn]].

===Music===
The official melody was composed by [[Rollo Armstrong]] of [[Faithless]] on behalf of UEFA.&lt;ref name=&quot;music&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/PressConference/Competitions/MediaServices/66/52/88/665288_DOWNLOAD.pdf |format=PDF|title=The official UEFA EURO 2008 music |date=28 February 2008 |publisher=[[UEFA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Euro 2008 song was &quot;[[Can You Hear Me? (Enrique Iglesias song)|Can You Hear Me]]&quot; by [[Enrique Iglesias]], which was performed live during the official closing ceremony prior to the final in [[Ernst Happel Stadion]] in Vienna on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro2008.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/MediaRelease/Competitions/MediaServices/69/80/81/698081_DOWNLOAD.pdf |format=PDF|title=Official UEFA EURO 2008 Song: &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot; by Enrique Iglesias |date=20 May 2008 |publisher=[[UEFA]] |accessdate=20 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two soundtracks, &quot;Like a Superstar&quot; and &quot;Feel the Rush,&quot; were recorded by Jamaican [[reggae]] artist [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] as mascot songs for Euro 2008. They formed a musical background to video clips featuring the twin mascots Trix and Flix.&lt;ref name=&quot;music&quot;/&gt; 

The official Swiss song for the tournament was a new version of &quot;Bring en hei&quot; (''Bring him Home'') by Baschi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.euro2008.uefa.com/MultimediaFiles/Download/MediaRelease/Competitions/MediaServices/69/80/81/698081_DOWNLOAD.pdf Official UEFA EURO 2008 Song: &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot; by Enrique Iglesias]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christina StÃ¼rmer]] sang the official tournament song of Austrian [[Ãsterreichischer FuÃballbund|ÃFB]], &quot;Fieber&quot; (''Fever'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://sport.orf.at/?href=http%3A%2F%2Fsport.orf.at%2Fticker%2F283601.html Christina StÃ¼rmers offizieller EM-Song heiÃt &quot;Fieber&quot;] on ''[[ORF|orf]].at''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] manager [[Slaven BiliÄ]] recorded his country's official Euro 2008 song, &quot;Vatreno ludilo&quot; (&quot;Fiery Madness&quot;), with his rock group, [[Rawbau]].

&quot;[[Seven Nation Army]]&quot; by [[The White Stripes]] was played when players walked out before kick-off,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/06/is_seven_nation_army_the_indie.html Seven Nation Army: the indiest football anthem ever?], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and a remix of &quot;Samba de Janeiro&quot; by German dance group [[Paffendorf|Bellini]] was played after each goal scored in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://euro2008.worldcupblog.org/news/whats-that-song-they-play-after-the-euro-goals.html What's That Song They Play After the Euro Goals?], Euro 2008 Championships on World Cup Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mascots===

{{seealso|UEFA European Football Championship mascot}}

The two official mascots for UEFA Euro 2008, were named after a vote from the public of the two host nations from the following options:
* Zigi and Zagi
* Flitz and Bitz
* Trix and Flix

After receiving 36.3% of the vote, Trix and Flix were chosen. &quot;I am sure the mascots and their names will become a vital part of the understanding of the whole event,&quot; said Christian Mutschler, who is the tournament director for Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/mascot/index.html |title=Official Mascot Naming }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slogan===
The slogan for UEFA Euro 2008 was chosen on 24 January 2007: ''Expect Emotions.''

The UEFA President [[Michel Platini]] stated &quot;It describes in a nutshell what the UEFA Euro 2008 has to offer: all kinds of emotions â joy, disappointment, relief or high tension â right up to the final whistle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=498653.html |title=Expect Emotions at Euro 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commemorative coins===
[[File:2008 Austria 5 Euro Soccer Coin 1 back.jpg|120px|thumb]]
[[File:2008 Austria 5 Euro Soccer Coin 2 back.jpg|120px|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2008 coinage|2008 European championship â¬5 commemorative coins]]]]

To celebrate this occasion, some countries in Europe issued special commemorative coins. Among them were the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2008 coinage|Austrian â¬5 2008 European championship commemorative coins]] (two coins). One coin shows players dribbling, while the other coin shows a striker trying to reach the ball. In the pieces, all eight venues of the 2008 finals, are depicted.

==Prize money==
[[UEFA]] announced that total of â¬184&amp;nbsp;million has been offered to the 16 teams competing in this tournament, increasing from â¬129&amp;nbsp;million in the [[UEFA Euro 2004|previous tournament]]. The distributions as below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/euro/news/kind=1/newsid=630838.html |title=UEFA raises 2008 prize money }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prize for participating: â¬7.5&amp;nbsp;million

Extra payment based on teams performances:
* Winner: â¬7.5&amp;nbsp;million
* Runner-up: â¬4.5&amp;nbsp;million
* Semi-finals: â¬3&amp;nbsp;million
* Quarter-finals: â¬2&amp;nbsp;million
* Group stage (per match):
** Win: â¬1&amp;nbsp;million
** Draw: â¬500,000

Spain, as winners of the tournament and winners of all three of their group stage matches, received a total prize of â¬23&amp;nbsp;million, the maximum possible prize money. Greece on the other hand, being the only team to lose all three of their group matches, were the only team to receive nothing more than the â¬7.5&amp;nbsp;million participation prize.
