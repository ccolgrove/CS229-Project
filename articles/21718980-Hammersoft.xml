The '''Florida Gators track and field''' program represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[track and field]].  The program includes separate men's and women's teams, both of which compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  The Gators host their home indoor meets in the [[O'Connell Center|Stephen C. O'Connell Center]] and their home outdoor meets at [[James G. Pressly Stadium|Percy Beard Track]], both located on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus.  The Gators track teams are currently led by head coach [[Mike Holloway]].

== History ==

The Florida Gators men's track and field team was organized in 1923; the Gators women's team was formed in 1973.  The University of Florida joined the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) in December 1932, and the Gators track team began to compete in the SEC in the spring of 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.gatorzone.com/trackfield/ History of the program]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the Gators have been a force in the SEC, and have won a total of twenty conference team championships.  The Gators men have won four SEC outdoor championships (1953, 1956, 1987, 2010), and six indoor championships (1975, 1976, 1987, 2010).  The Gators women have won five SEC outdoor championships (1992, 1997, 1998, 2003, 2009), and five indoor championships (1990, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2004).  Head coach [[Percy Beard]], a former elite hurdler and silver medalist at the [[1932 Summer Olympics]], led the Gators to their first national prominence in the 1940s, 1950s and early 1960s, including their first two SEC outdoor championships.  Beard's successor, [[Jimmy Carnes]], coached the Gators from the early 1960s until 1976, and accounted for the Gators' first two SEC indoor team championships, and was later selected to be the head coach of the U.S. Olympic team in 1980, and later severed as the head of the U.S. Track &amp; Field Association.

In 2009, the women's team won the SEC outdoor championship.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.gatorzone.com/story.php?id=15984  Florida Women Claim 2009 SEC Outdoor Track and Field Title],&quot; GatorZone.com (May 18, 2009).  Retrieved May 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
