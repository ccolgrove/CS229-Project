'''''Floribella''''' is a [[telenovela]] that was produced in [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]] and [[Chile]]. Each of those countries had their own cast, but the show had exactly the same name. Although they had the same name, all of them came from the first and original Argentine soap opera called ''[[Floricienta]]'', created by [[Cris Morena]].

==Plot==
''Floribella'' is based on the classic story, ''[[Cinderella]]''.

Flor is a pretty, young and poor girl who works for Frederico Fritzenwalden, who falls in love with Flor. However, Frederico is engaged with Delfina, who is a very mean and spoiled woman that fights against anything to marry the soonest possible Frederico and get his money.

But like in the fairy tales, the love always wins: Frederico finds out all the truth about Delfina, and all what she did to everyone. Unfortunately, in the very last week of the soap opera, Frederico dies (he dies differently in each country version), and with this ending, a new story starts with Flor and Conde MÃ¡ximo Augusto, so this way, the second season of ''Floribella'' begins.

==Floribella Brazil==

''Floribella'' was aired on the [[Rede Bandeirantes]] Channel of Television. The first season started on the April 4th 2005 and ended on the November 21st 2005. The second season began on January 23, 2006 and ended on the August 28th 2006.

''Floribella Brazil'' released its first musical album during the first season, which went double platinum. Also released its first musical [[DVD]] which topped the DVD sales ranking.  Over 40 licensed products with the Floribella brand were released.

Later on, a second album was released (alongside the second season) which received [[Platinum]] certification according to ABPD. Four DVDs were also released: the first season, the second season, a TV special and the live musical.

A paperback novel, ''As Aventuras de Floribella'', was released and it stayed during months on the top of the best-selling children fiction list compiled by [[O Globo]] and [[Epoca]].

The cast also did a sold-out tour which included stops in several cities in [[Brazil]] from August to December 2006.

During the show, [[Juliana Silveira]], who portrayed ''Floribella'', fell in love with [[Roger Gobeth]], who portrayed her romantic interest Frederico. They're engaged and are still together as of June 2009.

==Chile==
In 2006 began the production of the [[Chile]]an version by [[TelevisiÃ³n Nacional de Chile|TVN]], premiering on October of the same year. It reached high levels of rating, defeating its counterpart by [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]] ''Charly Tango''. The original name, &quot;Floricienta&quot;, couldn't be used because a private company had registered the trademark previously. It features actress [[Mariana DerderiÃ¡n]] on the role of Florencia and CristiÃ¡n Arriagada on the role of Federico. It was the most-watched fictional program of 2007 but a second season was not comitioned since [[TelevisiÃ³n Nacional de Chile|TVN]] didn't want to kill the Prince, which was necessary for a second season to happen.

The CD achieved platinum certification.
