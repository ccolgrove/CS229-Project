'''Dead Kennedys''' are an American [[punk rock]] band formed in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] in 1978. The band became part of the American [[hardcore punk]] movement of the early 1980s. They gained a large [[Underground music|underground]] fanbase in the international punk music scene.

Their music mixed the more experimental elements of British 1970s punk with the raw energy of the 1980s American hardcore punk scene. Dead Kennedys' songs mixed deliberately extreme lyrics with [[satire]], [[sarcasm]], and [[irony]] of social and political issues of the 1980s.

In the late 1980s, the band was embroiled in an obscenity trial in the United States over the artwork of their album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' (1985), which included the explicit titular subject of [[H. R. Giger]]'s ''[[Penis Landscape]]''. The band was charged with distribution of harmful matter to minors, but the trial ended with a [[hung jury]].

Dead Kennedys released five studio albums before disbanding in 1986. In 2001, the band reformed without original singer [[Jello Biafra]], who had been in a legal dispute with the other members over royalties.

The band played three performances in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livenation.com/Dead-Kennedys-tickets/artist/842801?tm_link=edp_Artist_Name |title=Dead Kennedys Tickets - Dead Kennedys Concert Tickets and Tour Dates &amp;#124; Official Live Nation Site |publisher=Livenation.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one of the concerts, they debuted their first new song since 1986, &quot;You're Such a Fake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;newmaterial&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcheavymetal.com/2010/10/18/a-post-about-the-dead-kennedys |title=A Post About The Dead Kennedys |publisher=Dcheavymetal.com |date=2010-10-18 |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the dissolution of Dead Kennedys, Biafra has continued to collaborate and record with other artists, including [[Mojo Nixon]], [[Al Jourgensen]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], and the [[Melvins]], and has become a [[spoken word]] performer, covering political topics in particular.

==History==
===Formation of the band (1978)===
Dead Kennedys formed in June 1978 in [[San Francisco, California]], when [[East Bay Ray]] (Raymond Pepperell) advertised for bandmates in the newspaper ''[[The Recycler]]'', after seeing a [[ska-punk]] show at [[Mabuhay Gardens]] in San Francisco. The original band lineup consisted of [[Jello Biafra]] (Eric Reed Boucher) on vocals, East Bay Ray on guitar, [[Klaus Flouride]] (Geoffrey Lyall) on bass, and [[6025 (musician)|6025]] (Carlos Cadona) on drums and percussion. This lineup recorded their [[The 1978 Demos|first demos]]. In early July, the band wanted a more experienced drummer, so they recruited [[Ted (musician)|Ted]] (Bruce Slesinger). 6025 left the band, however he was invited back as secondary guitarist. Their first show was on July 19, 1978, at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco, California.

Dead Kennedys played numerous shows at local venues afterwards. Due to the provocative name of the band, they sometimes played under [[pseudonym]]s, including &quot;The Sharks&quot;, &quot;The Creamsicles&quot; and &quot;The Pink Twinkies&quot;. The band's real name generated controversy. Wrote ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] in November 1978, &quot;Just when you think tastelessness has reached its nadir, along comes a punk rock group called The Dead Kennedys, which will play at [[Mabuhay Gardens]] on Nov. 22, the 15th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Despite mounting protests, the owner of Mabuhay says 'I can't cancel them NOW â there's a contract.' Not, apparently, the kind of contract some people have in mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Caen, Herb (November 17, 1978) &quot;On the Rotunda.&quot; ''San Francisco Chronicle.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite popular belief, the name was not meant to insult the [[Kennedy family]], but to quote Biafra, &quot;to bring attention to the end of the American Dream&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; 

6025 left the band in March 1979. In June, the band released their first single, &quot;[[California Ãber Alles]]&quot;, on the [[independent label]] [[Alternative Tentacles]]. The band followed with a well received [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] tour.

===Disruption of music awards show (1980)===
{{Details|Pull My Strings}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:Pullmystrings.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dead Kennedys at the Bay Area Music Awards]] --&gt;On March 25, 1980, Dead Kennedys were invited to perform at the Bay Area Music Awards in San Francisco to major record label artists to give the event some &quot;New Wave credibility&quot;, in the words of the organizers. The day of the performance was spent practicing the song they were asked to play, the underground hit, &quot;California Ãber Alles&quot;. In typically [[Subversion (political)|subversive]], perverse style, the band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song, Biafra said, &quot;Hold it! We've gotta prove that we're adults now. We're not a punk rock band, we're a [[New Wave music|new wave]] band.&quot;

The band, who all wore white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing a new song entitled &quot;Pull My Strings&quot;, a barbed, [[Satire|satirical]] attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry, which contained the lyrics, &quot;Is my cock big enough, is my brain small enough, for you to make me a star?&quot;. The song also referenced [[The Knack]]'s song &quot;[[My Sharona]]&quot;. &quot;Pull My Strings&quot; was never recorded for a studio release, though the performance at the Bay Area Music Awards, which was the first and only time the song was ever performed, was released on the band's compilation album ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]''.

===&quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; and ''Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables'' (1980â1981)===
In early 1980, they recorded and released the single &quot;[[Holiday in Cambodia]]&quot;. Later that year, the band released their debut album, ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]''. The album reached number 33 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. In January 1981, Ted announced that he wanted to leave to pursue a career in architecture and would help look for a replacement. He played his last concert in February 1981. His replacement was [[D.H. Peligro]] (Darren Henley).

Around the same time, East Bay Ray had tried to pressure the rest of the band to sign to the major record label [[Polydor Records]]; Biafra stated that he was prepared to leave the group if the rest of the band wanted to sign to the label,&lt;ref name=&quot;polydor&quot;&gt;Nardwuar the Human Serviette, December 2005 interview with Jello Biafra and The Melvins, as reproduced in [http://www.alternativetentacles.com/batcasts/batcast-013-2006_04_25.m4a Alternative Tentacles Batcast #15, April 25, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; though East Bay Ray asserts that he recommended against signing with Polydor. Polydor decided to not sign the band after they learned that the Dead Kennedys' next single was to be titled &quot;[[Too Drunk to Fuck]]&quot;.

When &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; came out in May of 1981, the song caused much controversy in the UK as the BBC feared the single would reach the Top 30; this would require a mention of the song on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. However, this never came to be as the single peaked at number 36.

===''In God We Trust, Inc.'', ''Plastic Surgery Disasters'' and Alternative Tentacles Records (1981â1985)===
After Peligro joined the band, the extended play ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' (1981) saw them moving toward full on hardcore/thrash. In addition to the EP's controversial artwork depicting a gold Christ figure on a cross of dollar bills, the lyrics contained Biafra's most biting social and political commentary yet, and songs such as &quot;[[Moral Majority]]&quot;, &quot;[[Nazi Punks Fuck Off!]]&quot; and &quot;[[We've Got a Bigger Problem Now]]&quot; placed the Dead Kennedys as the spokesmen of  social protest, while &quot;Dog Bite&quot;, a cover version of ''[[Rawhide (song)|Rawhide]]'' and various joke introductions showed a much more whimsical side. In 1982, they released their second studio album, ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]''. The album's cover features a withered starving African child's hand being held and dwarfed by a white man's hand. This picture won the World Press Photo award in 1980, and was taken in Karamoja district in [[Uganda]] by Mike Wells.

The band's music had evolved much in a short time, moving away from hardcore formulas toward a more innovative jazz-informed style, featuring musicianship and dynamics far beyond other bands in the genre (thus effectively removing the music from that genre). By now the group had become a de-facto political force, pitting itself against rising elements of American social and political life such as the religious right, Ronald Reagan and the idle rich. The band continued touring all over the United States, as well as Europe and Australia, and gained a large underground following. While they continued to play live shows during 1983 and 1984, they took a break from releasing new records to concentrate on the [[Alternative Tentacles]] record label, which would become synonymous with DIY alternative culture. The band continued to write and perform new material during this time, which would appear on their next album (some of these early performances can be seen in the ''[[Live at DMPO's on Broadway]]'' video, originally released by [[Dirk Dirksen]] and later reissued on Rhino).

===''Frankenchrist'' and obscenity trial (1985â1986)===
The release of the album ''[[Frankenchrist]]'' in 1985 showed the band had grown in terms of musical proficiency and lyrical maturity.{{no Citation needed, the music speaks for itself|date=February 2010}} While there were still a number of loud/fast songs, much of the music featured an eclectic mix of instruments including trumpets and synthesizers. Around this time [[Klaus Flouride]] released the similarly experimental solo EP ''[[Cha Cha Cha With Mr. Flouride]]''. Lyrically, the band continued their trademark social commentary, with songs such as &quot;[[M.T.V. â Get off the Air|MTV Get Off The Air]]&quot; and &quot;[[Jock-o-rama]]&quot; poking fun at mainstream America. In some ways the album represented an artistic peak.

However, the album also heralded in an era of prolonged legal trouble for the band. The artwork caused a furor with the newly formed Parents Music Resource Center ([[PMRC]]). In December 1985 a teenage girl purchased the album at the Wherehouse Records store in [[Los Angeles, CA|Los Angeles County]].&lt;ref name=WishniaNation&gt;Wishnia, Steven. &quot;Of Punk and Pornography: Rockin' With the First Amendment&quot;. ''The Nation''. October 24, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The girl's mother wrote letters of complaint to the [[California Attorney General]] and to Los Angeles [[prosecutors]].&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt; In 1986 members of the band, along with other parties involved in the distribution of ''Frankenchrist'', were charged criminally with distribution of harmful matter to minors. The store where the teen actually purchased the album was never named in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt; The criminal charges focused on an illustration by [[H.R. Giger]], titled &quot;Work 219: Landscape XX&quot; (also known as ''[[Penis Landscape]]''). Included as a poster with the album, ''Penis Landscape'' depicts nine copulating penises.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Matthieu [http://www.cas.sc.edu/socy/faculty/deflem/zzcens97.htm &quot;RAP, ROCK AND CENSORSHIP: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice&quot;] March 2001 revision of a paper presented originally to the Law and Society Association, Chicago, May 30-27 30, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the band and others in the chain of distribution were charged with violating the California Penal Code&lt;ref name=&quot;penalcode&quot;&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html California Penal Code] at leginfo.ca.gov&lt;/ref&gt; on a [[misdemeanor]] charge carrying a maximum penalty of up to a year in county jail and a base fine of up to $2,000. Biafra says that during this time government agents invaded and searched his home. The prosecution tried to present the poster to the jury in isolation for consideration as obscene material, but Judge Susan Isacoff ruled that the poster must be considered along with the music and lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [http://www.metnews.com/articles/2004/reti052804.htm &quot;Judge Isacoff, Commissioner Duffey Slate July Retirements&quot;] Metropolitan News-Enterprise. Friday, May 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The charges against three of the original defendants, Ruth Schwartz (owner of [[Mordam Records]]), Steve Boudreau (a distributor involved in supplying ''Frankenchrist'' to the Los Angeles Wherehouse store), and Salvatore Alberti (owner of the factory where the record was pressed), were dismissed for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt;

In August 1987, the criminal trial was submitted to the jury with the two remaining defendants: Jello Biafra and Michael Bonanno (former Alternative Tentacles label manager).&lt;ref name=WishniaNation/&gt; In August 1987, the criminal trial ended with a hung jury. The split on the jury was 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal for all of the [[defendant]]s. [[District Attorney]]s Michael Guarino and Ira Riener made a motion for a retrial which was denied by Judge Isacoff, [[Superior Court]] Judge for the County of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Drozdowski, Ted. [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/2503/interview06.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+06:47:56 &quot;Jello Biafra cuts to the politics of pop&quot;] Bullshit Detector&lt;/ref&gt; The album, however, was banned from many record stores nationwide.

Jello Biafra brought up the court case after the break-up of the band on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]. Biafra was on the show with [[Tipper Gore]] as part of a panel discussion on the issues of &quot;controversial music lyrics&quot; and censorship.

===''Bedtime for Democracy'' and break-up (1986)===
In addition to the obscenity lawsuit and being ignored by the mainstream media (MTV and most radio stations gave such groups scant notice, not to mention airplay), the band became increasingly disillusioned with the underground scene as well. The hardcore scene, which had been a haven for free-thinking intellectuals and downtrodden nonconformists, was increasingly attracting hooligans who came to punk concerts looking only to slam dance and fight to violent music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In earlier years the band had criticized neo-Nazi skinheads for trying to ruin the punk scene, but just as big a problem was the increasing popularity of thrash metal and stereotypical macho &quot;post-1982 hardcore&quot; which brought the group (and their genre) an audience that had little to do with the ideas/ideals they stood for. In January 1986, frustrated and alienated from their own scene, the DKs decided to break up to pursue other interests and played their last concert on February 21. The band continued to work on songs, with Biafra penning songs such as &quot;[[Chickenshit Conformist]]&quot; and &quot;[[Anarchy for Sale]]&quot;, which articulated their feelings about the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of punk rock.

During the summer they recorded these songs for their final album, ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', which was released in November. The artwork, depicting a defaced [[Statue of Liberty]] overrun with Nazis, media, opportunists, Klan members, corrupt government officials, and religious zombies, echoed the idea that the punk scene was no longer a safe haven for &quot;your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free&quot;. The album contains a number of fast/short songs interspersed with jazz (&quot;D.M.S.O.&quot;), spoken word (&quot;A Commercial&quot;) and psychedelia (&quot;Cesspools In Eden&quot;). The lyrical focus is more introspective and earnest (&quot;Where Do Ya Draw The Line?&quot;&quot;), with an anti-war, anti-violence (&quot;Rambozo The Clown&quot;) bent, moving away from the violent imagery of their early records, while remaining as subversive as ever (&quot;I Spy&quot;, &quot;D.M.S.O.&quot;). In December, the band announced their split. Biafra went on to speak about his political beliefs on numerous television shows and he released a number of [[spoken-word]] albums. Ray, Flouride, and Peligro also went on to solo careers.

===Legal conflicts===
====Lawsuits over royalty payments====
{{No footnotes|date=September 2008}}
In the late 1990s, former band members discovered problems with the amount of payments which each band member had received from their record label [[Alternative Tentacles]]. Former band members claimed that Jello Biafra had conspired to pay less royalty rates to the band members. Although both sides agreed that the failure to pay these royalties was an accounting mistake, they were upset that Biafra failed to inform the band of the mistake after he and his co-workers discovered it.

Biafra claims that their lawyers had told him only to correspond through lawyers and not directly with the band, as the conflict over payment had apparently arisen before the accounting mistake was discovered. Both sides claim they attempted to resolve the matter without legal action, but the ultimately complicated legal dispute (involving royalties, publishing rights, and a number of other issues) soon led to the courts, where Biafra was found liable for the royalties after the jury determined that he had committed [[fraud]] and [[malice (legal term)|malice]], and was ordered to pay damages of nearly $200,000, including $20,000 in punitive damages, to the band members.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Malice was defined for the jury as &quot;conduct which is intended to cause injury or despicable conduct which is carried with a willful and conscious disregard for the rights of others&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bs1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mi2n.com/press.php3?press_nb=17130 |title=''Music Industry News Network'' |publisher=Mi2n.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra's appeal was denied; he had to pay the outstanding royalties and punitive damages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v. Jello Biafra Verdict], Cal.App.1 Dist.,2003 A094272&lt;/ref&gt; and was forced to hand over the rights to the majority of Dead Kennedys' back catalogue to the Decay Music partnership.

The jury and judges also noted, in their words, that Biafra âlacked credibilityâ on the songwriting issue and found from evidence presented by both sides that the songwriting credits were due to the entire band, using a clause in the band's written partnership giving a small share of every Dead Kennedys song royalty directly to the band partnership.&lt;ref&gt;FN4, [http://www.phillaw.com/casepdfs/Dead%20Kennedys%20Superior%20Court.pdf Dead Kennedys v. Jello Biafra Verdict], Cal.App.1 Dist.,2003 A094272&lt;/ref&gt;

Biafra had received sole songwriting credit for most Dead Kennedys songs on all released albums for the last 20 years or so without complaints from the band, though a minority of songs had given credit to certain group members or the entire band as a whole, indicating a system designed to reflect the primary composers rather than a regimented system like the [[Jagger/Richards]] partnership; today, most Kennedys reissues list the songwriters as &quot;Biafra, Dead Kennedys&quot;, indicating Biafra's lyrical contributionsâwhich the band doesn't dispute, or else simply as &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot;). Ray, Flouride and Peligro found new distribution through another label, [[Manifesto Records]].

This dispute was hotly contested by all concerned who felt passionately for their cause, and the case caused minor waves within punk circles. Biafra claims that guitarist [[East Bay Ray]] had long expressed displeasure with Alternative Tentacles and with the amount of money he received from them, thus the original incentive for the discovery of the back payments. It was found out that Alternative Tentacles was paying Dead Kennedys less per CD than all the other bands, including Biafra himself, and not informing his other bandmates, which was the fraud. Biafra accused the band of wanting to license the famous Dead Kennedys song &quot;[[Holiday in Cambodia]]&quot; for use in a [[Levi's]] jeans commercial, which the band denied.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Biafra apparently pushed this issue in court, although there was no hard evidence and the jurors were apparently unconcerned with corporate use of independently produced political music. Biafra would later complain that the jury was not sympathetic toward underground music and punk culture. The song never appeared in a Levi's commercial, although in interviews Biafra described the situation surrounding the commercial in detail and was able to give specifics about the advertisement, including the name of the advertising agency that had created the commercial's script.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Biafra's former bandmates maintain that they sued because of Jello Biafra's deliberate withholding of money, though when pressed they have acknowledged that the payment was an accounting mistake, but insist that Biafra was wrong in failing to inform the band directly. Details about this issue remain scarce. The band also maintains that the Levi's story was completely fictitious and invented by Biafra to discredit them. Ultimately, these issues have led to a souring of relationships with the erstwhile bandmates, who still have not resolved their personal differences as of 2008.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

====Disputes over new commercial activities====
Matters were stirred up even further when the three bandmates invited Jello Biafra to &quot;bury the hatchet&quot; in the form of a band reunion. Jello Biafra felt it was unprofessional because no one contacted him directly. In addition, Biafra was disdainful of the reunion, and having long expressed his disdain for nostalgia and rock reunion/oldies tours in particular, argued that the whole affair was motivated by greed. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Several DVDs, re-issues, and live albums have been released since the departure of Biafra most recently on Manifesto Records. According to Biafra, the live albums are &quot;cash-ins&quot; on Dead Kennedys' name and his music. Biafra also accused the releases of the new live material of having poor sound quality. Furthermore he has stated he is not receiving any royalties from the sale of any Manifesto Records releases. Consequently, he has discouraged fans from buying any Dead Kennedy reissues. The other band members denied Biafra's accusations regarding the live releases, and have defended the mixes as an effort of hard work. Biafra dismissed the new group as &quot;the world's greediest karaoke band.&quot; Nevertheless, in 2003, [[Klaus Flouride]] said of performances without the band's former frontman: &quot;There hasn't been a show yet that people didn't really like.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizinemag.com/music/music-0309_klausflouride.htm &quot;Interview with Dead Kennedys' Klaus Flouride&quot;] by Mark Prindle, ''Citizine'', September 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Biafra further criticized them for advertising shows using his own image taken from the original '80s incarnation of the band, which he labeled as false advertising. He recently attacked the reformed Dead Kennedys in a song called &quot;[[Those Dumb Punk Kids (Will Buy Anything)]]&quot;, which appears on his second collaboration with sludge metal band [[The Melvins]], ''[[Sieg Howdy!]]''.

Biafra told an audience at a speaking gig in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]], that the remaining Dead Kennedys have licensed their single &quot;Too Drunk to Fuck&quot; to be used in a rape scene in a [[Robert Rodriguez]] movie. The reference is to a lounge cover of the song, recorded by the band [[Nouvelle Vague (band)|Nouvelle Vague]], played during a scene in the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' segment of ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', although no rape takes place, and in fact the would-be rapist is killed by the would-be victim. The scene in ''Planet Terror'' has would-be rapist, &quot;Rapist #1&quot; ([[Quentin Tarantino]]) order one-legged stripper &quot;Cherry Darlin&quot; ([[Rose McGowan]]) to get up off the floor and dance. At this point Tarantino hits play on a cassette recorder and Nouvelle Vague's cover of &quot;Too Drunk To Fuck&quot; plays.

Jello, clearly disapproving of the situation, later wrote, &quot;This is their lowest point since Levi'sâ¦ This goes against everything the Dead Kennedys stands for in spadesâ¦ The terrified woman later 'wins' by killing Tarantino, but that excuse does not rescue this at all. I wrote every note of that song and this is not what it was meant forâ¦. Some people will do anything for money. I can't help but think back to how prudish Klaus Flouride was when he objected to H.R. Giger's painting on the &quot;[[Frankenchrist]]&quot; (sic) poster, saying he couldn't bear to show it to his parents. I'd sure love to be a fly on the wall when he tries to explain putting a song in a rape scene for money to his teenage daughterâ¦ The deal was pushed through by a new business manager the other three hired.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativetentacles.com/news.php?page=3&amp;news_section=JELLO&amp;window_size=15&amp;sd=iIdfyzSpZwkE0A3pVRu &quot;Greedy ex-DKs okay song for rape scene in new Tarantino Movie&quot;] Alternative Tentacles news page, March 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforming of new band line-up===
The reformed Dead Kennedys followed their court victory by announcing a number of tour dates, releasing reissues of all Dead Kennedys albums (except ''[[Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables]]'', to which they did not have the rights until 2005), releasing several new archival concert DVDs, and licensing several songs to ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'' remake and the [[Tony Hawk Pro Skater]] video game. [[East Bay Ray]] claims he received a fax from Alternative Tentacles purporting Biafra approved the licensing for the game,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadkennedysnews.com/images/tonyhawk.jpg Fax from Uli Elser], previous manager of Alternative Tentacles, May 5, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; which Biafra denies happening.

The band claims on their website that they still pay close attention to an [[anti-corporate]] ideology, despite performing on September 5, 2003 at a festival in [[Turkey]] that was sponsored by [[Coca-Cola]], noting that they have since pulled out of a show in Los Angeles when they found that it was being sponsored by [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.htm#100605 DKs Pull Out of âWaking the Deadâ Show]&quot; ''DeadKennedys.com''. October 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Biafra claims the above mentioned licensing deals prove otherwise. Some have found difficulty reconciling this claim when Biafra also licensed to major corporations, approving with the other band members use of Dead Kennedysâ songs in major studio film releases such as ''[[Neighbors (film)|Neighbors]]'', ''[[Freddy Got Fingered]]'', and ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|1389065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Ray, Peligro, and Flouride chose former [[Dr. Know (band)|Dr. Know]] singer [[Brandon Cruz]] to replace Biafra on vocals. The band played under name &quot;DK Kennedys&quot; for a few concerts, but later reverted to &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot; permanently. They played across the continental United States, Europe, Asia, South America, and Russia. Brandon Cruz left the band in May 2003 and was replaced by [[Jeff Penalty]]. The band has released two live albums of archival performances on Manifesto Records: ''[[Mutiny on the Bay]]'', compiled from various live shows including a recording from their last show with Biafra in 1986, and ''[[Live at the Deaf Club]]'', a recording of a 1979 performance at the Deaf Club in [[San Francisco]] which was greeted with more enthusiasm.

On October 9, 2007, a best-of album entitled ''[[Milking the Sacred Cow]]'' was released. It includes two previously unreleased live versions of &quot;Soup Is Good Food&quot; and &quot;Jock-O-Rama&quot;, originally found on ''Frankenchrist''.

Jeff Penalty left the band in March, 2008 in what he describes as a &quot;not amicable split.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/28168 |title=Jeff Penalty leaves the Dead Kennedys |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by former [[Wynona Riders]] singer Ron &quot;Skip&quot; Greer. D.H. also left the band to &quot;take some personal time off&quot;. He was replaced for a tour by [[Translator (band)|Translator]] drummer [[Dave Scheff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.html#032408 |title=Welcome To The Official Website For Dead Kennedys |publisher=Deadkennedys.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Break from touring===
On August 21, 2008, the band announced an extended break from touring due to the health-related issues of Flouride and Peligro. They stated their plans to collaborate on new projects. The band performed a gig in [[Santa Rosa, California]] in June 2009, with Peligro returning to the drum kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadkennedys.com/tours.html |title=Official Dead Kennedys web site |publisher=Deadkennedys.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010 the Dead Kennedys announced plans for a short East Coast tour. This lineup assembled for this tour contained East Bay Ray, Peligro, Greer, and bassist Greg Reeves replacing Flouride, who was taking &quot;personal time off&quot; from the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadkennedys.com/news.html#081110 |title=Official web page news section |publisher=Deadkennedys.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://serviette.ca/radio_show/2011/nw20110211.mp3 Nardwuar interview with Jello Biafra], February 11, 2011, accessed April 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The tour dates will include performances in [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Portland, Maine]] and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/39114 |title=Dead Kennedy's 2010 tour |publisher=Punknews.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible new material===
The Dead Kennedys performed what appears to be their first new song in 24 years, &quot;You're Such a Fake&quot;, during their October 16, 2010, concert at the Rock and Roll Hotel in [[Washington, D.C.]] In addition, the band played a reworked version of the old song &quot;MTV Get Off the Air&quot;, now re-titled &quot;MP3 Get Off the Web&quot;, with lyrics that were &quot;changed to be about people downloading MP3s and how much they suck for doing it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newmaterial&quot;/&gt;

==&quot;DK&quot; logo==
[[Image:DK logo.jpg|thumb|right|70px|&quot;DK&quot; logo]]The original logo was created by [[Winston Smith (artist)|Winston Smith]]. He later contributed artwork for the covers of ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'', ''[[Plastic Surgery Disasters]]'', ''[[Frankenchrist]]'', ''[[Bedtime for Democracy]]'', ''[[Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death]]'', the back cover of the &quot;[[Kill the Poor]]&quot; single and the [[Alternative Tentacles]] logo. When asked about the &quot;DK&quot; logo in an interview, Jello Biafra explained, &quot;...I wanted to make sure it was something simple and easy to spray-paint so people would graffiti it all over the place, and then I showed it to Winston Smith. He played around with it, came back with a bunch of designs that had the circle and slightly 3-D looking letters and he had ones with different patterns behind it. I liked the one with bricks, but ultimately I thought simple red behind it was the boldest and the best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trembleunderboomlights.blogspot.com/2007/05/interview-with-jello-biafra.html |title=Tremble Under Boom Lights: Interview with Jello Biafra |publisher=Trembleunderboomlights.blogspot.com |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lyrics==
Dead Kennedys were noted for the harshness of their lyrics, which generally combined biting social satire while expressing a staunchly left-wing view of contemporary America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/music/artist/dead-kennedys.1/ |title=Dead Kennedys on MSN Music |publisher=Music.msn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Dead-Kennedys/.../9780867193121 ]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other leftist punk bands who use more direct sloganeering, Dead Kennedys' lyrics were often snide. &quot;[[Holiday in Cambodia]]&quot; is a multi-layered satire targeting both yuppies and [[Cambodia]]'s then-current communist [[Khmer Rouge]] regime.
