'''JoaquÃ­n AndÃºjar''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ã¦|n|Ë|d|uË|h|Ér}} {{respell|an|DOO|har}}; born December 21, 1952) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] right-handed [[starting pitcher]] who became one of the most dominant [[pitcher]]s in baseball while playing with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the mid-80s.

==Early years==
AndÃºjar signed with the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in {{by|1969}} a month shy of his seventeenth birthday. He posted a 33-41 record with a 4.33 [[earned run average]] over six seasons in the Reds' farm system. Following the {{by|1975}} season, he was dealt to the [[Houston Astros]] for two players to be named later.

==Houston Astros==
AndÃºjar made his major league debut in the {{by|1976}} season opener against his former franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN197604080.shtml|title=Cincinnati Reds 11, Houston Astros 5|date=April 8, 1976|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two [[relief pitcher|relief]] appearances against the Reds, he was moved into the starting rotation. On July 11 &amp; 17, AndÃºjar pitched consecutive 1-0 [[shutout]]s against the [[Montreal Expos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU197607110.shtml|title=Houston Astros 1, Montreal Expos 0|date=July 11, 1976|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN197607170.shtml|title=Houston Astros 1, New York Mets 0|date=July 17, 1976|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the season, he went 9-10 with a 3.60 ERA.

AndÃºjar was 10-5 with a 3.47 ERA at the {{by|1977}} [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]] to be named the Astros' sole representative at the [[1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star game]]. However, he injured himself in his final start before the game and could not play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/1977_all_star_game_play_by_play.shtml|title=1977 All-Star Game Play by Play|date=July 19, 1977|publisher=Baseball Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not return to his team until September, and finished the season 11-8 with a 3.69 ERA.

AndÃºjar began seeing more work out of the [[bullpen]] in {{by|1978}} and earned his first career [[save (baseball)|save]] on August 25 against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN197607170.shtml|title=Houston Astros 7, Pittsburgh Pirates 5|date=August 25, 1978|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began the {{by|1979}} season in the bullpen, and was 4-2 with a 3.23 ERA with three saves and two blown saves when he was added back to the starting rotation. He responded with four consecutive [[complete game]] victories in which he gave up just one [[earned run]] per game. He was named to his second [[National League]] [[1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]], and pitched two innings while giving up two [[Run (baseball)|runs]] (one earned).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS197907170.shtml|title=1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|date=July 17, 1979|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, he pitched a four hit complete game against the [[Montreal Expos]] while hitting an [[inside the park home run]] to account for both of the Astros' runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU197908140.shtml|title=Houston Astros 2, Montreal Expos 1|date=August 14, 1979|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went 3-8 in {{by|1980}} splitting time between starts and relief appearances. The Astros won a one game play-off against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] to send AndÃºjar to his first post-season. He recorded a [[save (baseball)|save]] in game two of the [[1980 National League Championship Series]] against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI198010080.shtml|title=1980 National League Championship Series, Game Two|date=October 8, 1980|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After starting the {{by|1981}} season 2-3 with a 4.94 ERA, he was dealt to the St. Louis Cardinals for [[Tony Scott (baseball)|Tony Scott]] just before the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]].

==St. Louis Cardinals==
AndÃºjar returned to a starting role with the Cards, and responded by going 6-1 for the rest of the 1981 season. He was a horse for the Cardinals in {{by|1982}}, as he pitched a career high 265.2 [[inning]]s. He won his last seven decisions, and had a 1.64 ERA down the stretch to finish the season at 15-10. He pitched a three hit shutout of the Philadelphia Phillies at [[Veterans Stadium]] on September 15 that put his team a game and a half up on the Phils in the [[National League East]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI198209150.shtml|title=St. Louis Cardinals 8, Philadelphia Phillies 0|date=September 15, 1982|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lead they held for the remainder of the season.

The Cards swept the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the [[1982 National League Championship Series]], with AndÃºjar starting and winning game three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ATL/ATL198210100.shtml|title=1982 National League Championship Series, Game Three|date=October 10, 1982|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started games three and seven of the [[1982 World Series]] against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], winning both with a 1.35 ERA. His own [[error (baseball)|error]] contributed to an [[unearned run]] in game three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN198210200.shtml|title=1982 World Series, Game Three|date=October 20, 1982|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AndÃºjar had a career year in {{by|1984}}. He was 13-6 with a 2.90 ERA at the All-Star break to earn his third [[1984 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star selection]], but was unable to attend. He ended the season at 20-14 with a 3.34 ERA, leading the league in wins, innings pitched (261.1) and shutouts (4) while winning the [[Gold Glove Award]] at his position.

AndÃºjar got off to a 12-1 start in {{by|1985}}, and made his fourth [[1985 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star team]]. The [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] and New York Mets' became embroiled in a heated battle for the NL East crown came down to the wire in 1985. AndÃºjar went 3-1 with a 4.29 ERA against the Mets. Perhaps the most memorable game AndÃºjar pitched in the rivalry that developed between the two clubs was a 5-2 loss on October 2 against [[Dwight Gooden]] that allowed the Mets to pull within a game of the Cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN198510020.shtml|title=New York Mets 5, St. Louis Cardinals 2|date=October 2, 1985|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cardinals won the following day, and ended up taking the division by three games over the Mets. AndÃºjar ended the season at 21-12 with a 3.40 ERA. In the [[1985 National League Championship Series]], AndÃºjar was ineffective in his game two start against the Los Angeles Dodgers, putting the Cards in a two game hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN198510100.shtml|title=1985 National League Championship Series, Game Two|date=October 10, 1985|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cards, however, came back to win the following four games (with AndÃºjar starting the decisive game six, but not figuring in the decision)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN198510160.shtml|title=1985 National League Championship Series, Game Six|date=October 16, 1985|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to head to the [[World Series]].

===1985 World Series===
The World Series against the [[1985 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] went poorly for AndÃºjar. He lasted four plus innings in game three, and took the loss opposite a dominant [[Bret Saberhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN198510220.shtml|title=1985 World Series, Game Three|date=October 22, 1985|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Tudor (baseball)|John Tudor]], meanwhile, was 3-1 with a 1.59 ERA that post-season, leading Cardinals manager [[Whitey Herzog]] to go with Tudor in the decisive game seven despite the fact that AndÃºjar was on five days rest.

The strategy failed, as Tudor was pulled in the third with the bases loaded and three runs already on the board. The score was 10-0 by the time Herzog brought AndÃºjar in for mop up duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/KCA/KCA198510270.shtml|title=1985 World Series, Game Seven|date=October 27, 1985|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When umpire [[Don Denkinger]] called a ball, AndÃºjar emphatically showed his disagreement, and had to be restrained by teammates. Herzog exploded and was ejected. A pitch later, AndÃºjar was ejected by Denkinger, who misread a gesture by AndÃºjar to [[catcher]] [[Darrell Porter]] and again had to be held back by his teammates.

Some believe that Herzog purposely sent the volatile AndÃºjar to the mound as payback for Denkinger's infamous [[Don Denkinger#The Call|call]] in Game six. Before getting ejected by Denkinger in Game seven, Herzog said to him, &quot;We wouldn't even be here if you hadn't missed the fucking call last night!&quot; However, Herzog has often stated AndÃºjar was his only pitcher that still had any life left in his arm. AndÃºjar was so furious that after being ejected from Game seven, he took a baseball bat and demolished a [[toilet]] in the visitor's clubhouse bathroom in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]'s [[Kauffman Stadium|Royals Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,960337,00.html|title=Falling Cards|date=November 11, 1985|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oakland A's==
During that [[Winter]]'s meetings, the Cardinals dealt AndÃºjar to the [[Oakland Athletics]] for [[Tim Conroy]] and [[Mike Heath]]. He was to begin the {{by|1986}} season serving a ten-game suspension (later reduced to five) for the World Series altercation with Denkinger. On top of that, on February 28, 1986, [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Peter Ueberroth]] handed down suspensions to seven players who admitted during the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]] that they had abused [[cocaine]] for the entire 1986 season without pay, AndÃºjar included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o1QNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Q24DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4329,87402&amp;dq=joaquin+andujar+oakland&amp;hl=en|title=Players Penalized for Drug Ties|date=March 1, 1986|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspensions were reduced to anti-drug donations and [[community service]].

As luck would have it, Denkinger was the [[home plate]] umpire for AndÃºjar's first start of 1986. It was uneventful, though AndÃºjar lasted just four plus innings while giving up six earned runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198604120.shtml|title=California Angels 9, Oakland A's 3|date=April 12, 1986|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his start to the season, AndÃºjar had a decent year in 1986, going 12-7 with a 3.82 ERA. He suffered numerous injuries along the way, including an injury sustained during batting practice even though pitchers do not bat in the [[American League]].

Injuries limited AndÃºjar to just thirteen starts in {{by|1987}}. The last being on August 3, in which he last just two-thirds of an inning and gave up three runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198708030.shtml|title=Seattle Mariners 4, Oakland A's 3|date=August 3, 1987|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final season==
AndÃºjar returned to the Astros to be part of their bullpen for {{by|1988}}, however, made some starts in the middle of the season due to injuries in the starting rotation. He ended the season at 2-5 with a 4.00 ERA. He tried to make a comeback and negotiated a non-guaranteed $1 million contract with the [[1989 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] in {{by|1989}}, but he failed to make the team.
