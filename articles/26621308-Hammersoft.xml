'''University College Dublin (also known as UCD)''' ({{lang-ga|An ColÃ¡iste Ollscoile, Baile Ãtha Cliath}} (''COBÃC'')) - formally known as  '''University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin''' ({{lang-ga|An ColÃ¡iste Ollscoile, Baile Ãtha Cliath - Ollscoil na hÃireann, Baile Ãtha Cliath}}) is the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s largest, and [[Ireland]]'s second largest, [[university]], with over 1,300 faculty and 17,000 [[student]]s. It is located in [[Dublin]], the Irish capital.

The university originates in a body founded in 1854 as the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] with [[John Henry Newman]] as the first rector, re-formed in 1880 and chartered in its own right in 1908. The Universities Act, 1997 renamed the ''constituent university'' as the &quot;National University of Ireland, Dublin&quot;, and a ministerial order of 1998 renamed the institution as &quot;University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nui.ie/about/history.asp History of the NUI - Constituent Universities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally located in the centre of the metropolis, most of the university's faculties have since been relocated to a 148 hectares (365 acre) park campus at [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]], four kilometres to the south of the city.

==History==
The university can trace its history to the institution founded in 1854 as the [[Catholic University of Ireland]], was established as UCD in 1880 under the auspices of the Royal University, and received its charter in 1908.

In the years following Catholic emancipation in Ireland, a movement led by Cardinal [[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Paul Cullen]] attempted to provide for the first time in Ireland higher-level education that was both accessible to Irish Catholics and taught by fellow-Catholics. In the 19th century, the question of denominational education in Ireland was a contentious one. It had divided [[Daniel O'Connell]] and the [[Young Ireland]] Movement for many years. The Catholic Hierarchy wanted to counteract the &quot;Godless Colleges&quot; established in [[University College Galway|Galway]], [[Queens University|Belfast]] and [[University College Cork|Cork]] and to provide a Catholic alternative to [[Trinity College, Dublin]].  Trinity was Anglican in its origins and, though Catholics had studied there since the 1780s, Trinity had maintained a religious test that excluded them from membership of the college's governing bodies (see [[Denis Caulfield Heron]]).  In 1850 at the [[Synod]] of [[Thurles]] it was decided to open a Catholic University. 

As a result of these efforts a new Catholic University of Ireland was opened in 1854 and Blessed [[John Henry Newman]] was appointed as its first rector. Newman had been an integral figure in the [[Oxford Movement]] in the 19th Century. The Catholic University opened its doors on the feast of St Malachy, 3 November 1854. On that day the names of seventeen students were entered on the register and Newman gave the students an address &quot;What are we here for&quot; and prophesied that in later years they would look back with pride on the day. The university opened with three houses: 86 St Stephen's Green, with was known as St Patrick's or University House, under the care of Rev. Dr Michael Flannery; 16 Harcourt Street, known as St Lawrence's under the care of Rev. Dr James Quinn, who also had his school there; and Newman's own house, 6 Harcourt Street, known as St Mary's under Newman's personal supervision.

Amongst the first students enrolled it included the grandson of [[Daniel OâConnell]]. Another included [[William O'Shea]] who would go onto become a Captain in the British Army and was central to the divorce crises which brought down [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]'s career in trying to establish Home Rule for Ireland. O'Shea though clashed with Newman and left to go to Trinity, however, after one year. Of the eight original students in Newman's own home, two were Irish, two English, two Scottish and two French. Among them were a French viscount, and Irish baronet Sir Reginald Barnewall, the son of a French countess, the grandson of a Scottish marquis, and the son of an English lord. Later were added to his care two Belgian princes and a Polish count. Many were attracted to the University on the basis of the reputation of Newman. 

As a private university the Catholic University was never given a royal charter, and so was unable to award recognized degrees and suffered from chronic financial difficulties. Newman left the university in 1857 and it subsequently went into a serious decline. Dr Bartholomew Woodlock appointed Rector and served until he became Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise in 1879. In this period he attempted to secure a site of 34 acres at Clonliffe West but the scheme collapsed when expansion of the railway system on the north side of Dublin cut across the site. He then turned his attention to expanding along St Stephen's Green and over these years bought from No. 82 to 87.

This trend was reversed in 1880 with the establishment of the Royal University of Ireland. The Royal Universities charter entitled all Irish students to sit the Universities examinations and receive its degrees. Although in many respects the Catholic University can be viewed as a failure, the future University College inherited substantial assets from it including a successful medical school (Cecilia Street) and two beautiful buildings, Newman House on St Stephen's Green and the adjoining University Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universitychurch.ie/ University Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation of University College, Dublin===
[[File:Gbuildings.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Government buildings, Dublin. The former location of the UCD science and engineering faculties. Opened by [[King George V]] in 1905]]
In order to avail of the benefits of the [[Royal University of Ireland]] arrangement, the Catholic University was re-formed as University College, Dublin. The college rapidly attracted many of the best students and academics in Ireland including [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[James Joyce]] and quickly began to outperform the other three colleges in the Royal University system - in the fifteen years before the establishment of the National University the number of first class distinctions in Arts awarded by the Royal University to University College was 702 compared with a total of 486 awarded to the combined Queen's Colleges of [[Queen's University Belfast|Belfast]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|Galway]] and [[University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork|Cork]]. Many of the collegeâs staff and students during this period would later contribute substantially to the formation and development of the future Irish state, the most famous being  [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], [[PÃ¡draig Pearse]], [[Hugh Kennedy]], [[Eoin MacNeill]], [[Kevin Christopher O'Higgins|Kevin OâHiggins]], [[Tom Kettle]], [[James Ryan (Irish politician)|James Ryan]], [[Douglas Hyde]] and [[John A. Costello]]. Student unrest occurred  during this period, especially during loyalist speeches by the Chancellor, the Earl of Meath and the playing of &quot;God Save the King&quot; at conferring ceremonies.

In 1908, the Royal University was dissolved and a new [[National University of Ireland]] founded to replace it. This new University was brought into existence with three constituent University Colleges - Dublin, Galway and Cork. By this time the college campus consisted of a number of locations in and around St Stephens Green in Dublins city centre, the main sites being Earlsfort Terrace, Cecilia Street, College of Science Merrion Street, and Newman House on St Stephen's Green.
Under the Universities Act, 1997, University College Dublin was established as a constituent university within the National University of Ireland framework.

===UCD and the Irish War of Independence===
[[File:Belfield Arts Block 1445w.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Tierny (Administration) and Newman (Arts) Buildings, Belfield campus, UCD.]]
In 1913 in response to the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]], [[Eoin MacNeill]], professor of early Irish history (who viewed the movement as a threat to the Home Rule movement), called for the formation of an Irish nationalist force to counteract it. The [[Irish Volunteers]] were formed later that year and MacNeill was elected its Chief-of-staff. At the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in view of the [[Home Rule Act 1914]] the majority of the volunteers opted to support the British war effort, including many UCD staff and students. Many of those who opposed this move later participated in the [[Easter Rising]].

In this way UCD was a reflection of the Irish nationalist community in general, with several staff and students participating in the rising, such as [[Patrick Pearse]], [[Thomas MacDonagh]], [[Michael Hayes (politician)|Michael Hayes]] and [[James Ryan (Irish politician)|James Ryan]], and a smaller number, including [[Tom Kettle]] and [[Willie Redmond]], fighting for the British in [[World War I]] during the same period.

Many UCD staff, students and alumni fought in the [[Irish War of Independence]] that followed the rising. Following the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] four UCD graduates joined the [[government of the Irish Free State]]. It is notable that the [[First DÃ¡il Ãireann]]  was located in UCD's Earlsfort Terrace campus from 1919 to 1922, when they moved to their current location in [[Leinster House]].

The university's graduates have since had a large impact on Irish political life - four of the eight [[President of Ireland|Presidents of Ireland]] and six of the twelve [[Taoiseach|Taoisigh]] have been either former staff or graduates. Of the fifteen current members of the Irish cabinet, nine are former UCD students.

===Move to Belfield===
[[File:UCDEgg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'Noah's egg' outside the Veterinary School by  [[Rachel Joynt]] (2004)]]
By the early 1940s the College had become the largest third level institution in the state. In an effort to cope with the increased numbers unsuccessful attempts were made to expand the existing city centre campus. It was finally decided that the best solution would be to move the College to a much larger greenfield site outside of the city centre and create a modern [[campus university]]. This move started in the early 1960s when the faculty of science moved to the new {{convert|1.4|km2|acre}} park campus at [[Belfield, Dublin|Belfield]] in a suburb on the south side of Dublin. The Belfield campus has since developed into a complex of modern buildings and inherited Georgian town houses, accommodating the colleges of the University as well as its student residences and many leisure and sporting facilities. One of UCD's previous locations, the ''Royal College of Science'' on Merrion Street is now the location of the renovated [[Irish Government]] Building, where the Department of the [[Taoiseach]] (Irish prime minister) is situated. University College Dublin had also a site in [[Glasnevin]] for much of the last century, the [[Albert Agricultural College]], the southern part of which is now occupied by [[Dublin City University]], the northern part is where [[Ballymun]] town is located.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/gsi/pdf/33-2/ballymun.pdf The development of the Ballymun housing scheme, Dublin, 1965-1969,SinÃ©ad Power, Department of Geography, University of Edinburgh]&lt;/ref&gt;

===UCD Horizons===
At the beginning of the 2005/2006 academic year, UCD introduced the ''Horizons'' curriculum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/horizons UCD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which completely semesterised and modularised all undergraduate programmes enhancing the quality and flexibility of the standard university education. Under the Horizons curriculum, new undergraduate students have greater choice in what exactly they study in their programme. Under the new curriculum, students choose ten core modules from their specific subject area and two other modules, which can be chosen from any other programme across the entire University (this applies in the majority of programmes, however some exceptions, as in Arts Omnibus and Business &amp; Law, can apply). For example, a student studying Stage 1 Commerce as his primary degree programme can also choose one module (or two) from the Stage 1 Law programme (subject to space availability, timetable constraints and so on).

==Student life==
===Sport===
[[File:UCDStudentCentre.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Student Centre, Belfield campus, UCD]]
UCD has very strong sporting traditions and a very successful competitive record in a great range of sports. The most successful clubs during 2005/2006 were the Senior Hurling team (winners of the Dublin County Championship), the Senior Hockey team (winners of the Leinster Senior Cup), the Senior Basketball team (University Championship winners), the Ladies Volleyball team (which won the University Championships and the English Student Cup), the Under-20 Rugby team (which won a league and cup double), the table tennis team (which won the Irish Universities Championships for the 7th year in a row), the Soccer teams (winning a variety of cups and leagues), the Senior Men's Cricket Team (Varsity Plate Winners) and the Ultimate Frisbee Open Team (winners of Div 2 UK Nationals). The current U.C.D. five a side soccer champions are Five Young Fun Boys managed by Ciaran Fisher and assisted by Patrick Coman.

The most successful clubs in 2006/2007 were the Table Tennis Club (Irish Universities Champions for the 8th year in a row, Leinster Cup Champions &amp; SuperLeague Champions, qualifying for the ETTU European Cup), the Fencing Club (Intervarsity winners 5th year in a row, Colours winners 10th year in a row, Darius Vasseghi Team Foil Cup winners, Trinity Team Cup Winners) and the Cricket Club (joint inter-varsity winners).

The Belfield campus is home to a wide range of sports facilities, but notably lacks a swimming pool and a running track. Facilities include the national hockey stadium (which has previously hosted the [[World Hockey Cup|Women's Hockey World Cup Finals]] and the Men's Hockey European Championship Finals), two other stadia (one for rugby and one for soccer), one of the largest fitness centres in the country, squash courts, tennis courts, an indoor rifle range, over twenty sports pitches (for rugby, soccer and gaelic games), an indoor climbing wall and two large sports halls. It is hoped that a swimming pool will be added before 2010. There are currently over fifty sports clubs in UCD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucd.ie/sport/clublist.htm UCD - UCD Sport&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These cater for archery to windsurfing and just about everything in between. Probably the three largest and most successful clubs are the [[University College Dublin A.F.C.|soccer club]] (currently the only university team to compete in the top division of the national league in Western Europe), the [[University College Dublin RFC|rugby club]] (currently playing in the [[AIB League]] Division 2) and the [[UCD GAA|Gaelic Sports club]].

The University hosted the [[IFIUS]] [[World Interuniversity Games]] in October 2006.

===Societies===
[[File:Belfield 1414w.JPG|thumb|250px|The main restaurant building, with the corner of the Quinn School of Business visible on the left, Belfield campus, UCD.]]
There are currently over fifty [http://www.ucd.ie/socs.htm student societies] in the university. They cater for many interests ranging from large-scale party societies such as Ag Soc, [http://www.artssoc.com Arts Soc], [http://www.cesociety.com/ Commerce and Economics Society] and [http://www.qsoc.ie/ Qsoc]. There are religiously-interested groups such as the [http://www.ucd.ie/cunion Christian Union], the [http://www.ucdisoc.com/ Islamic Society] and the [http://www.ucdhumanistsociety.wordpress.com Secular Humanist Society], a television station [http://www.ctn.ie Campus Television Network], academic-oriented societies like the [http://www.ucd.ie/philsoc/ Philosophy Society], [http://www.ucd.ie/mathsoc/ Mathsoc], [http://www.ucdclassicalsociety.org Classical Society], Filmsoc and everything in between, including An Cumann Gaelach, an Irish-language society and such charities as St. Vincent de Paul, [http://www.ucd.ie/svdp UCDSVP]. All Irish political parties are represented on campus including Young Fine Gael, Ãgra Fianna FÃ¡il, The Socialist Party, Sinn FÃ©in, The Green Party and [http://www.labour.ie/youth/oncampus/index/20030909085645.html UCD Labour Youth]. The college has two debating unions. The oldest student society is the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]], which is currently in its 156th session. The [[University College Dublin Law Society]], however, is both the largest debating society in the University, and also holds the largest membership of any society; having 5,248 members in the 09/10 Academic Year{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. It is now in its Centenary Session and aside from debating it also acts as a mooting, entertainment and professional development society.  Away from politics and debating the [[UCD Dramsoc]] is the university drama society, it is noted for an active membership and a number of notable alumni. The university also has a successful sinfonia called [[University College Dublin Symphony Orchestra]].

===Students' Union===
[[File:Glenomena3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Glenomena student residences, Belfield campus, UCD.]]
The [[students' union]], [[UCDSU]] in the college has been an active part of campaigns run by the National Union, [[Union of Students in Ireland|USI]], and has played a highly significant role in the life of the college since its foundation in 1974.

The Union has also taken significant stances on issues of human rights that have hit the headlines in Ireland and around the world, particularly in becoming the first institution in the world to implement a ban of [[Coca-Cola]] products in Student Union controlled shops on the basis of alleged human and trade union rights abuses in [[Colombia]]. This ban was overturned in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityobserver.ie/2010/03/05/ucd-students-overturn-coke-ban-as-lynam-wins-students-union-presidency/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Union's main Governing Body is the Union Council which meets every two weeks during term. Council membership consists of 180+ seats for Class Representatives, ten directly elected officers of the Union Executive and five Executive officers elected by Union Council at its first meeting each year. Their term commences on 1 July in the year of their election and lasts for twelve months. Sabbatical elections take place in late February of each year. To date, students from Arts, Social Science and Law have predominated in holding council seats.

===Student publications and media===
====Newspapers====
The university has two student papers, the broadsheet ''[[The University Observer]]'' and the tabloid [[College Tribune]]. Both papers are usually published on a fortnightly basis throughout the academic year.

=====''The University Observer''=====
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Universityobserver.gif|right|250px|]] --&gt;
''[[The University Observer]]'' won the Newspaper of the Year award at the National Student Media Awards in April 2006, an accolade it has achieved many times. Founded in 1994, its first editors were Pat Leahy and comedian [[Dara Ã Briain]]. Many figures in Irish journalism have held the position of editor including ''The Irish Times'' deputy news editor Roddy O'Sullivan, ''The Sunday Business Post'' political correspondent Pat Leahy, AFP business reporter Enda Curran, ''[[Sunday Independent]]'' Chief Reporter [[Daniel McConnell (journalist)|Daniel McConnell]], [[RTÃ]] News reporter Samantha Libreri and TV researcher Alan Torney. The efforts of its staff were noted by the prestigious ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' Student Media Awards with a nomination for &quot;Best Newspaper&quot;, the first Irish student publication to receive such recognition. In 2001, in addition to several Irish National Student Media Awards, the ''University Observer'' under McConnell and Curran took the runner up prize for &quot;Best Publication&quot; at the Guardian Student Media Awards in London. To date, ''The University Observer'' has won 29 [[Irish Student Media Awards]].

The main sections within the paper are: campus, national and international news, comment, opinion and sport. In addition, each edition includes a pullout arts and culture supplement called ''O-Two'', with music interviews, travel, fashion and colour pieces. ''The University Observer'' is funded by the UCD Students' Union, but its content remains editorially independent, barring one 'Union Page' per issue.

=====[[College Tribune]]=====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:College Tribune Issue 4.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Front page of issue 4 of the 'College Tribune', 2006]] --&gt;
The [http://www.collegetribune.ie ''College Tribune''] was founded in 1988, with the assistance of noted political commentator [[Vincent Browne]], then an evening student in the college, who noted the lack of an independent media outlet for students and the college in general. Financially, it is supported by commercial advertising in the paper and is completely independent of college and union authorities. Former editors include Conor Lally, Crime Correspondent of the ''Irish Times'', ''The Sunday Times'' journalist Richard Oakley, former ''Sunday Tribune'' reporter Eoghan Rice, Paul Lynch, film critic of the ''Sunday Tribune'', ''Irish Independent'' soccer correspondent Daniel McDonnell, and brothers Gary and Fergus O'Shea, both now in the ''Irish Sun'', who were editors in 1996-97 and 2001-02 respectively.

Other past contributors include Dave Kelly, now rugby correspondent with the ''Irish Independent'' and Katherine Smyth a former associate producer with BBC Current Affairs. The ''College Tribune'' was tied to the national ''Sunday Tribune'' through its connections with Vincent Browne, but such links ended in 1999. The ''Tribune'' has also been distinguished on several occasions at national student media awards, particularly in sportswriting, where it has a strong tradition. The paper won the Student Newspaper of the Year at the USI/Irish Independent media awards in 1996. The then editor, Conor Lally, won Student Journalist of the Year in 1996. ''Tribune'' stalwart Peter Lahiff was a recipient of a Guardian Award for Diversity in 2003, the only Irish-based recipient of any ''Guardian'' award to date.

''College Tribune'' sections include news, features, opinion, music, film, sport and colour writing, and it is famous for the launch of the satirical page The Evil Gerald, a 'paper within a paper'. The ''Gerald'' was succeeded by ''The Turbine'' in 2003, and they have featured such satirical stories as the [[Provisional IRA]] dropping its pursuit of a United Ireland in favour of occupation of the [[Isle of Man]], and [[Osama Bin Laden]] stealing the Magic Door from [[Bosco]] which allowed him access to anywhere in the world.

====Radio and Television====

UCD also has a student radio station,  [http://www.belfieldfm.ie/ Belfield FM], broadcasting at selected times throughout the academic year across the campus on 107.8 FM and online at the station's website. The station is funded by the students' union and has nurtured current [[RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann|RTE]] presenters [[Ryan Tubridy]] and [[Rick O'Shea]]. BelfieldFM has become widely recognised as a leader in Irish student media.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.
&lt;ep&gt;
Belfield FM was a successor to UCD FM, which had been run out of the Students' Union entertainments office. Launched by [[Gearoid O'Connor]] and [[Enda Curran]] in 2000 along with senior producers [[Laura Fletcher]] (now of RTE), [[Barry Ward]] (now councillor for FG and Senior Counsel), [[Aidan Meaghen]], [[Eoghan Casey]], [[Daniel McConnell]] (now of Sunday Independent), it applied for and was granted capital funding of over â¬20,000 from the college to purchase studio equipment. 

At the beginning of the academic year 2005-2006, the creation of a student television station, titled Campus Television Network (CTN) was announced. The station began creating programmes in November 2006 and distributing them online, at its old [http://www.ucd.ie/campustv/ website], and across the campus in the student bars and student centre. CTN does not actually broadcast any shows themselves, either through the college network or via traditional analogue or satellite methods, rather it allows downloads and viewing of programmes on their website and distributes DVDs to on campus venues. It currently produces a variety of shows from their entertainments show 'Ent...This!' to their fashion shows 'Nu Look' and 'Slick'. CTN can be viewed on its new website at [http://www.ctn.ie www.ctn.ie].

== UCD in popular culture ==
=== In literature ===
[[James Joyce]]âs novel ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' is partially set in UCD (when it was sited on [[Earlsfort Terrace]]) where [[Stephen Dedalus]] is enrolled as a student. Joyce's posthumously-published autobiographical novel ''[[Stephen Hero]]'' contains stories of his time in UCD. [[Brian O'Nolan|Flann O'Brien]]âs novel [[At Swim-Two-Birds]] features a UCD student who writes a meta-novel wherein the author is put on trial by the characters of his novel.[[Maeve Binchy]]'s novel, ''[[Circle of Friends (novel)|Circle of Friends]]'', deals with three female friends starting college in UCD in the 1950s. However, shots of Trinity College were used in the ''[[Circle of Friends (1995 film)|1995 film]]''.  The second [[Ross O'Carroll-Kelly]] novel, ''The Teenage Dirtbag Years'', follows Ross as he enters UCD.

=== In music ===
[[Christy Moore]] wrote a tongue in cheek song about UCD's [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)|Literary and Historical Society]] called &quot;The Auditor of the L and H&quot;. Johnny Jurex &amp; The Punk Pistols, predecessors to Rocky De Valera &amp; The Gravediggers had a song called &quot;Anarchy in Belfield&quot; which they played at their only gig during Rag Week in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishrock.org/irodb/bands/jurex.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In film and television ===
[[Conor McPherson]]'s third film ''Saltwater'' was filmed in Belfield, UCD. In ''[[Boston Legal]]'', Season 2, Episode 21 &quot;Word Salad Day&quot;, there is a reference to a study from UCD that &quot;found that the effects of divorce on children are far more damaging than the death of a parent&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.boston-legal.org/script/BL02x21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
