'''Emotional Selection''' is a [[psychological]] theory of [[dream|dreaming]] introduced in 2008 by Richard Coutts and refined in 2010.

Emotional selection describes a process that executes a set of [[Dream|dreams]] during [[non-REM sleep]] with content that is tentatively [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodated]] by [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]]. Because [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] coexist as a [[wikt:network|network]], [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] can introduce accidental, maladaptive conflicts and therefore are ideally tested prior to full integration. Consequently, during subsequent [[REM sleep]] a second set of [[Dream|dreams]] is executed in the form of [[scenario testing|test scenarios]]. If [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] performed during prior [[non-REM]] [[Dream|dreams]] alleviate anxiety, frustration, sadness, or in other ways appear [[emotions|emotionally]] adaptive during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] dream tests, they would be [[selection|selected]] for retention. Those [[accommodation (psychology)|accommodations]] that compare negatively to existing, unchanged [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] would be abandoned or further modified and tested. 

[[Jean Piaget]] described [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] as being riddled with conflict, which is why Coutts asserts that they are modified and tested with dreams during sleep. From his paper, &quot;People strive for independence, yet find solace in the company of others; they place a high priority on our personal safety, yet quickly jeopardize it to help those in need; they are sexually attracted to many people, yet seek loving, [[monogamous]] relationships. [[Schema (psychology)|Schemas]] help strike the balances necessary for navigating the complex, often contradictory landscape that comprises life.&quot;{{cite quote}}

The [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] targeted by emotional selection are those essential for meeting [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|human needs]]. Consequently, emotional selection theory agrees with [[evolution|evolutionary]] forces by describing a role for [[Dream|dreams]] as adaptively enhancing [[Schema (psychology)|mental schemas]].

The theory of dreams selecting adaptive mental schemas can be considered 
a special case of the survival value of emotional communication in 
general. The german philosopher [[Ferdinand Fellmann]] proposed in 2009 
emotional selection  as a third form of evolutionary selection besides 
natural and sexual selection. Loving, monogamous pair-bonding  seems to 
be the favoured field where sexual selection is being transformed in 
emotional selection specific for human courtship and mating.
