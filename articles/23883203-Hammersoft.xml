The '''1967 Oregon State Beavers football team''' represented [[Oregon State University]] in the [[1967 college football season|1967 NCAA college football season]]. The [[Oregon State Beavers football|Beavers]] ended this season with seven wins, two losses, and a tie.  The Beavers scored 187 points and allowed 137 points. Led by head coach [[Dee Andros]], Oregon State finished tied for second in the [[Pacific-12 Conference|Athletic Association of Western Universities]] (then informally known as the Pacific-8, a name it would officially adopt the following year) for a second consecutive year.  In a four-week period, the Beavers became the only team to ever go undefeated against three top two teams in one season since the inception of the [[AP Poll]], earning the nickname &quot;Giant Killers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Portland Tribune&quot;&gt;[http://www.portlandtribune.com/sports/story.php?story_id=122226762013026700]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.prodigy.net/tubbsy/Giantkillers.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game notes==
===Before the season===
[[Oregon State]] ended the 1966 season on a six-game winning streak.  Nobody expected much out of the Beavers in 1967; even the Oregon State media guide said that the Beavers would be &quot;rebuilding&quot; in 1967. Quarterback [[Paul Brothers]], who led Oregon State to the [[1965 Rose Bowl]] as a [[sophomore]], and fullback [[Pete Pifer]], the Beavers' all-time leading rusher, graduated in 1966. [[Dee Andros]] gave the starting quarterback job to junior, [[Steve Preece]], the [[wunderkind]] Andros had recruited from [[Idaho]] shortly after he took the head coaching job at Oregon State. Another newcomer on offense was junior fullback, [[Bill Enyart|Bill &quot;Earthquake&quot; Enyart]]. Enyart spent his first two years backing up Pifer. However, Enyart was too talented to keep off the field, earning All-Coast honors at linebacker. The team only boasted six seniors.

[[Stanford Indians football|Stanford]] made their first trip to [[Portland, Oregon]], in 12 years.  Oregon State and Stanford met for the first time since the Indians almost derailed the Beavers' [[1965 Rose Bowl]] trip. Oregon State entered the game a one-point favorite. In the second quarter, the Beavers' Billy Main opened scoring by running in untouched from five yards out. Mike Haggard's extra point gave Oregon State a 7â0 lead. The lead would last all of 15 seconds. Stanford's Nate Kirtman returned the kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown, knotting the score at seven. Six minutes later, Mark Waletich's punt only traveled 10 yards, giving the Beavers the ball at the Indians' 39. Oregon State drove 34 yards to set up Mike Haggard's 22-yard field goal with less than three minutes left. On the ensuing kickoff, Stanfordâs [[Gene Washington (49ers)|Gene Washington]] mistakenly downed the ball at his own one-yard line. The Indians could only manage four yards and Waletich could only manage a second 10-yard punt. The Beavers could only manage four yards themselves, but Haggardâs 28-yard field goal gave Oregon State a 13â7 lead with just over a minute left in the first half. In the second half, Stanford could only muster a 44-yard field goal attempt, which fell short of the crossbar. The Beavers' [[Skip Vanderbundt]] killed off three drives with interceptions. His second was with less than five minutes left. His last was at the Oregon State 16 with 1:25 left, which effectively ended the game.  The Beavers would not win another season opener until 1977, under second-year coach Craig Fertig.

The game was played in 102 degree heat. Dee Andros summed up the playing conditions by saying, &quot;It's hot as hell.&quot; [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]] caught the first break, recovering an Oregon State fumble at the Beaver 20. Oregon State's [[Mike Groff]] ended the threat by intercepting Ed Roseborough at the Beaver 15. Six plays later, [[Steve Preece]] dove in the end zone for a 7â0 lead. The Sun Devils responded by driving 63 yards for a touchdown of their own but missed the extra point. Late in the second quarter, Oregon State's [[Don Summers]] ran in from one-yard and Mike Haggardâs extra point split the uprights. The Beavers went into the locker room up 14â6.

In the first four minutes of the second half, Oregon State extended the lead on Preece's six-yard touchdown, but Haggard's extra point was blocked. In the third quarter, Arizona State benched Roseborough in favor of Rick Shaw. Shaw led the Sun Devils on a 47-yard drive and hit [[J.D. Hill]] for a two-point conversion to pull within six. Midway through the fourth quarter, Preece ran in for his third touchdown of the game. Arizona State countered with a late touchdown to make the score a more-respectable 27â21 but never seriously threatened after that. The Sun Devils went 8â1 the rest of the way, only losing by two to undefeated Wyoming, who finished #6 in the AP Poll, one spot in front of the Beavers.

In the seventeen seasons from 1956â1972, Oregon State and [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] played 12 times, more times than Oregon State played conference opponents California and [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] in the same period. The Hawkeyes won the first five meetings, but the Beavers won the sixth 17â3 in 1966. In the first seven minutes, Oregon State built a 14â0 lead. Steve Preece scored the first, running untouched into the end zone from 35 yards out. Billy Main scored the second by dragging two defenders into the end zone. Main tacked on a second touchdown from 40 yards out later in the quarter. The Beavers had a chance to add another first quarter touchdown but fumbled at the one. Oregon State got the ball back at their own six, and drove 94 yards on 11 plays. [[Bill Enyart]]'s two-yard second quarter plunge put the Beavers up 28â0. Mike Haggard tacked on a 27-yard field goal for a 31â0 halftime lead. Iowa managed to outscore Oregon State 18â7 in the second half, although the Hawkeyes' final touchdown came with three seconds left. The nine-game wining streak remains the Beavers longest since 1962â1963.

By the time Oregon State arrived in [[Seattle, WA|Seattle]], the season was already beginning to take its toll on the Beavers.  Starters, Harry Gunner and Mike Waletich, were sidelined.  Gary Houser was unable to play tight end but still managed to perform his punting duties.  Oregon State fumbled on its second play from scrimmage.  [[Washington Huskies football|Washington]] drove to the six before Charlie Olds came up with an interception in the end zone.  The Beavers subsequently drove 80 yards in 14 plays for a touchdown, capped off by Steve Preeceâs one-yard plunge.  Mike Haggard shanked the extra point, one of only three missed extra points in 1967, to keep the score 6â0.  The Huskies responded by driving 72 yards to set up a 21-yard field goal to pull within three.  Late in the half, a bad punt was nullified because the Beavers were called for clipping; instead of Oregon State getting the ball at their own 42, Washington took over at the Beaver 36.  The Huskies drove 27 yards in five plays to set up a 26 yard field goal, which sent the teams into the locker rooms tied at six.  Neither team threatened until the fourth quarter.  The Beavers fumbled at their 35.  From there, Washingtonâs Carl Wojchiechowski ran in from 18-yards out with two minutes left to win 13â6.

===Brigham Young===

[[BYU Cougars football|Brigham Young]] was 2â1. Their only loss was to undefeated Wyoming in [[Wyoming]]. Wyoming finished the season #6 in the AP Poll. The Cougars had defeated New Mexico and West Michigan by a combined 55 points. On Oregon Stateâs second play from scrimmage, Steve Preece was intercepted. Eight plays later, the Cougars were up 7â0. Later in the quarter, Don Whitley intercepted a Brigham Young pass and returned it to the Cougar two. On the next play, [[Bill Enyart]] plowed in for a touchdown, knotting the score at seven. The Beaversâ best drives in the second quarter ended on a fumble and a missed 50-yard field goal. Brigham Young scored on a 40-yard field goal with less than three minutes left to take a 10â7 lead. They tacked on a 68-yard touchdown pass to take a 10-point lead into halftime.

Early in the fourth quarter, the Cougars added another touchdown for a 24â7 lead. Oregon State managed to scrape together a 31-yard touchdown pass from Preece to Billy Main to pull within 11.  The Beaversâ best drive after that point ended after an interception. After Oregon Stateâs defense forced a punt, the Beaversâ next drive ended when Preece's pass bounced off a receiverâs helmet and was intercepted by [[Bobby Smith]]{{Disambiguation needed|date=June 2011}}. Smith returned the interception 27 yards for a touchdown to wrap up the Brigham Young victory.  Oregon State committed 11 turnovers in the game, one fewer than the 12 the Beavers committed over the next five games.

===Purdue===

Entering the game, three undefeated teams topped the [[AP Poll]]: the Trojans, the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Boilermakers]], and the Bruins. All three were on the Beaversâ schedule over the next four weeks. The first was #2 Purdue, the defending [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] champions on a nine-game winning streak. In 1967, the Boilermakers started the season beating [[Texas A&amp;M]] in [[Texas]] and [[#1 Notre Dame]]. The week before Oregon State came to [[West Lafayette, IN|West Lafayette]], Purdue beat Ohio State 41â6 in [[Columbus, OH|Columbus]].  The win is the largest by any team over the Buckeyes in [[Ohio Stadium]] since 1946.

Purdue's stars were [[Mike Phipps]] at quarterback and Marvin Leroy Keyes at cornerback, running back, and punt and kick returner. Keyes would finish third in the Heisman balloting in 1967 and second in 1968. In both years, he was an All-American at both cornerback and running back. He graced the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]]'s 1968 college football preview. In 1987, he was voted the all-time greatest Purdue football player. In 2004, [[College Football News]] voted him the 86th best football player of all-time. Phipps would finish second in the Heisman balloting in 1970. The Boilermaker faithful did not give the Beavers much of a chance, erecting tombstones with the Oregon State playersâ names on them. The Beaver coaches made sure to drive the Oregon State bus past them the day before the game. Purdue entered the game 20-point favorites.

Oregon State's first drive went 82 yards, ending in a touchdown on an 18-yard touchdown pass from Steve Preece to Roger Cantlon for a 7â0 lead. The Boilermakers took less than two minutes to drive 62-yards for their own touchdown on Keyesâ 15-yard run to tie the game at seven with more than ten minutes left in the first quarter. At that point, the defenses took over, holding both offenses scoreless for more than 24 minutes. Late in the second quarter, [[Jess Lewis]] and Jon Sandstrom combined to recover a fumble at the Purdue 26. The Beavers drove 17 yards to set up Mike Haggardâs 26-yard field goal with 46 seconds left in the half. Oregon State went into the locker room 30 minutes away from pulling off the upset.

In the third quarter, Keyes scored his second touchdown on a seven-yard run to give the Boilermakers the lead for the first time, 14â10. After the touchdown, the Beaversâ defense stiffened, not allowing Purdue past the Oregon State 40 for the rest of the game. Late in the third quarter, the Beavers pulled within one on Haggardâs 32-yard field goal. With 6:35 left, Jess Lewis came up with his second fumble at the Boilermaker 30. Six of the next seven plays, Preece handed off to Bill Enyart, who capped the drive with a four-yard run with 3:54 left. However, the two-point conversion failed, leaving Oregon State in front by five. Haggard was instructed to kick the ball away from Keyes. He lofted the ball high in the air, and Purdue was unable to field the kick, which was recovered by the Beavers' Mel Easley on the Boilermaker 28. Oregon State only managed seven yards, but Haggard converted his third field goal, a 38-yarder with 1:06 left to put the Beavers on top 22â14. Purdue's last hope evaporated when Mike Groff intercepted the Boilermakers' first pass on their next drive to seal the victory. 2000 people turned out at the Corvallis Airport to welcome the team home. The Beavers' win remains Oregon State's only visit to West Lafayette.  The Beavers have not returned to [[Indiana]].

===Washington State===

After a first quarter [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]] punt, personal fouls on back-to-back plays gave Oregon State the ball at the Cougar 12. Five Bill Enyart carries later, the Beavers were up 7â0. Washington State's best drives of the first half ended in a missed 40-yard field goal and a fumble that [[Skip Vanderbundt]] recovered at the Oregon State 31. On the ensuing drive, a 28-yard Billy Main carry gave the Beavers the ball at the Cougar nine. Enyart carried three consecutive times for his second touchdown and a 14â0 Oregon State lead with 1:38 left.  The Beavers held Washington State to three-and-out and got the ball back at their own 27. After a 15-yard screen pass from [[Steve Preece]] to Billy Main, Preece hit Main again for a 58-yard touchdown and a 21â0 Oregon State lead.

On the Cougars' opening drive of the second half, they pulled within two touchdowns.  Two minutes later, Washington State recovered a blocked Gary Houser punt at the Beaver four. However, the Cougars could get no closer on four plays to end the threat. Oregon State would tack on two fourth quarter touchdowns to take a 35â7 lead. Washington State would threaten one more time. The Beavers' Larry Rich made a touchdown-saving tackle at the Oregon State three, and the Beavers kept the Cougars out of the end zone to preserve the 28-point victory.

===UCLA===

Oregon State and [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] met for the first time since 1958, the final year of the [[Pacific Coast Conference]]. The game pitted the Beavers against their former coach, [[Tommy Prothro]], for the first time. The game was the third between [[Dee Andros]] and Prothro. Prothro had won the first two. The Bruins began the season by beating [[#3 Tennessee]]. They followed the win by beating Pittsburgh in [[Pennsylvania]] by 32. Later in the season, they returned to Pennsylvania and beat [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] by two. The Nittany Lions wound up #10 in the AP Poll; the loss to UCLA was their biggest loss of the year.

The star for UCLA was quarterback [[Gary Beban]], who would go on to win the 1967 [[Heisman trophy|Heisman]] and Maxwell Trophies. He and their three All-Conference linemen were the biggest reasons the Bruins were averaging 31 points an outing, averaging victories over their opponents by more than 15 points a game. There was no All-Conference selection for kicker in 1967, but UCLA's [[Zenon Andrusyshyn]] almost certainly would have been the All-Conference selection. The Bruinsâ bye week was the previous week, so UCLA had two weeks to prepare for the Beavers. Oddsmakers initially made the Bruins a 13-point favorite but gamblers loaded up on upset-minded Oregon State. At kickoff, the spread was a mere seven points.

In the first quarter, the Beavers got the first break, when Oregon Stateâs Jim Belcher came up with a fumbled punt at the UCLA 38. Two plays after Steve Preece scrambled for 35 yards, Bill Enyart bowled in from one yard out for a 7â0 lead. At the beginning of the second quarter, the Bruins stopped Enyart six inches from the end zone (although both Preece and Enyart continue to believe that Enyart crossed the goal line). The stop revitalized UCLA, which drove 99 yards for a touchdown, knotting the score at seven. The Bruins followed the touchdown with a 52-yard Andrusyshyn field goal. With less than two minutes left, UCLA recovered a blocked Gary Houser punt at the Beaver 16. Oregon Stateâs defense did not allow the Bruins a yard, but Andrushyn kicked a 33-yard field goal to give UCLA a 13â7 halftime lead.

Both teams' defenses dominated most of the third quarter, but the Beavers' Billy Main managed to scamper into the end zone from nine yards out. Mike Haggardâs all-important extra point hit the left upright, which preserved a 13-all tie. In the fourth quarter, the Bruins put together a 71 yard drive aided by an inadvertent whistle, which nullified a UCLA fumble. The Bruins had to settle for a 26-yard field goal. UCLA threatened again later in the quarter, but Mark Waletich intercepted a Beban pass in the Oregon State end zone with less than two minutes left. The Beavers drove 69 yards in less than a minute but faced fourth-and-five at the Bruin 11. Andros opted to try a field goal. Haggardâs 28-yard field goal split the uprights with 1:15 left. The Bruins, trying to avoid the first blemish on their record drove to the Oregon State 23. Andrushyn came on for a 40-yard field goal attempt, but Ron Boley batted down the kick with less than 10 seconds left to preserve the tie. The 16 points were the fewest that UCLA would score in 1967.  Preece was voted [[Athletic Association of Western Universities]] Back of the Day. Defensive end Harry Gunner was voted Athletic Association of Western Universities Lineman of the Day. 1000 people turned out at the Corvallis Airport to welcome the team home. The game had barely ended when Dee Andros began being assailed by questions about Oregon State's chances against the [[#1 Trojans]]. He finally grew sick of it and said, &quot;I'm tired of playing these number two ranked teams. Bring on number one.&quot;

===Southern California===

The #1 [[USC Trojans football|Trojans]] were a juggernaut. In the 1960s, USC would finish no worse than second in their conference, winning six conference championships, playing in five Rose Bowls and winning two national championships. The [[1967 USC Trojans football team|1967 Trojans]] may have been the best Trojan team in the decade. ''[[Sporting News|The Sporting News]]'' ranked that USC team as the #9 team of the 20th century. Their non-conference schedule included [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football (1960â1969)|#1 Notre Dame]] in [[Notre Dame Stadium|Notre Dame]]; [[Michigan State Spartans football|#3 Michigan State]] in [[Spartan Stadium (East Lansing)|East Lansing]]; and [[Texas Longhorns football|#4 Texas]] in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Coliseum]]. Southern California started off the non-conference slate with a 17â13 win over Texas. Then, they defeated Michigan State 21â17. In the Battle for the [[Jeweled Shillelagh]], the Trojans defeated the Irish 24â7 at Notre Dame. The 17-point loss served as the largest margin of defeat the Irish would endure at Notre Dame between 1963 and 1976. When the Trojans rolled into Corvallis, they were averaging winning every game by more than 20 points against a very difficult schedule. The game marked the Trojans' first-ever trip to Corvallis. All previous Oregon State &quot;home&quot; games between the two teams had been held in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].

USC's two biggest stars were right tackle [[Ron Yary]] and halfback [[O. J. Simpson]]. Yary was the best lineman in the country and would win the Outland and Rockne Trophies at the end of the year. Simpson led the country with 1050 rushing yards. He would go on to finish second on Heisman ballots in 1967 and would win the trophy in 1968. Both players would wind up as the first overall pick of the [[NFL draft]] after their respective senior seasons, and each would enter both the [[College Football Hall of Fame|College Football]] and [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Pro Football Halls of Fame]]. On defense, the Trojans had three First Team All-Americans: [[Tim Rossovich]] at end, [[Adrian Young]] at linebacker, and [[Mike Battle]] in the secondary. The game was highly anticipated. California governor (and future [[President of the United States|President]]) [[Ronald Reagan]] and Oregon governor [[Tom McCall]] made the trip. Reagan had famously said he would handpick a box of oranges if Oregon State won. Tom McCall turned the boast into a bet when he offered to put up a freshly caught silver salmon against Ronald Reagan's handpicked box of oranges. The game was held on [[Veterans Day]], so, along with the two governors, ten generals and admirals, including Lt. General [[Jimmy Doolittle]]; three [[Medal of Honor|Congressional Medal of Honor]] recipients; and the Air Force Academy Drum and Bugle Corps were on hand. 41,494 fans filled the 40,750-seat stadium. It was the most-attended single sporting event in the history of Oregon to that date. The weather, which became a topic of contention after the fact, was typical for a November in Oregon. From the eighth to the eleventh only .83&quot; of rain fell. At kickoff, the [[1967 USC Trojans football team|#1 Trojans]] were 11-point favorites over the #13 Beavers.

On the Trojans' first play from scrimmage, Simpson quickly showed he was worthy of Heisman consideration, rushing for 40 yards around left end. However, the Trojans were forced to settle for a 36-yard field goal attempt, which sailed wide right. The Trojans did not get any closer to the Beaver end zone for the rest of the game. By the end of the first quarter, Simpson had already rushed for 87 yards. Early in the second quarter, the Juice finally broke loose. He shook off a tackler at the Trojan 37 and steamed upfield with three blockers to lead him. He only had one man to beat, Mark Waletich. Simpson slowed down to allow his blockers dispatch the overmatched defender. However, out of nowhere, Jess Lewis closed on Simpson, eventually dragging O.J. down from behind at the Beaver 32. USC would get eight yards on the next three plays. Rather than attempt a 41-yard field goal, the Trojans went for it, but Ron Boley tackled the Trojans' quarterback, Steve Sogge, for no gain. Later in the second quarter, Oregon State's [[Skip Vanderbundt]] came up with a Southern California fumble at the Trojan 47. Over the next eight plays, the Beavers rushed for 34 yards all on running plays by Bill Enyart, Steve Preece, and Billy Main. On fourth-and-three at the Trojan 13, Mike Haggard's 30 yarder split the uprights for a 3â0 lead. After holding USC to a three-and-out, Oregon Stateâs Bob Mayes ran 25-yards on a reverse. However, Haggard's second attempt from 28 yards sailed wide right, and the half ended with a 3â0 Oregon State lead.

In the third quarter, Oregon State's Enyart took off from the Beaver 24, and was not caught until he reached the Trojans' 19. When he was tackled, Enyart fumbled. The fumble was recovered by USC's team captain, Adrian Young. As the game wore on, both defenses only seemed to get stronger. Early in the fourth quarter, USC faced a third-and-two at its own 23. Ron Boley dropped Steve Sogge for a loss. Later in the quarter, the Trojans had their best scoring opportunity of the second half, when they faced third-and-one at Oregon State's 42. Boley again tackled Sogge in the backfield for a two-yard loss. Oregon State's returner, Charlie Olds, received the ensuing punt at the Beaver nine and raced downfield. He was hit at the Trojan 35-yard line and fumbled. The ball bounced near Olds but not near enough to recover the fumble. Instead, Olds knocked the ball out of bounds. The referees called a penalty for illegal batting, which was a personal foul, penalized by an automatic change of possession. USC was unable to generate a first down on the drive. In the last 44 minutes of the game, the Trojans managed just three first downs and only crossed midfield twice. Perhaps the best boost for the defense was the punting of Gary Houser. USC did not start a drive beyond their own 35 after a Houser punt all game long. With three minutes left, [[Skip Vanderbundt]] forced a Simpson fumble. It proved to be Simpson's final carry. He ended with 188 yards rushing but, more importantly, no touchdowns. Fittingly, Jess Lewis came up with the fumble at the Trojan 35. Oregon State's offense was so enthused that they managed their only first downs of the second half, which enabled the Beavers to run out the clock.

The 3â0 loss was the last time the Trojans would be shut out until they went on probation in 1983. The 1967 Oregon State team remains the only college football team to go undefeated against three top two teams in the same season. It is unclear whether [[Tom McCall]] ever received the box of oranges Ronald Reagan had promised to hand-pick. UCLA's 48â0 win over Washington the same day eliminated Oregon State from the Rose Bowl race. Conference rules did not permit more than one team to go to a bowl game at the time, so the Civil War would be Oregon State's last game of the year. On November 18, [[1967 UCLA Bruins football team|#1 UCLA]] and [[1967 USC Trojans football team|#2 USC]] battled for the [[Victory Bell (USC-UCLA)|Victory Bell]] in the Coliseum. UCLA was 7â0â1 and USC was 8â1. It has been dubbed the &quot;Game of the Century&quot; and the &quot;signature game&quot; in the rivalry. [[1967 USC vs. UCLA football game|The 21â20 win]] on Simpson's 64-yard fourth quarter scamper helped propel the Trojans to a national championship. The Beavers' 1967 win over USC would be their last over the Trojans until 2000.

The final opponent on [[#8 Oregon State]]'s schedule was 2â7 [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]]. The Ducks were not another giant, but they were improving. Their two victories had both come in the previous four weeks. Oregon's strength was their defense behind defensive coordinator [[John Robinson (American football coach)|John Robinson]], All-Conference nose guard George Dames, and All-Conference defensive back [[Jim Smith (defensive back)|Jim Smith]]. The 1967 Civil War was the first at newly-built [[Autzen Stadium]].

Gary Houser's first punt was partially blocked and recovered by the Ducks at the Beaver 31. On their first play from scrimmage, Oregon's [[Eric Olsen]] threw a 20-yard pass. The Ducks would only gain one yard on three plays and had to settle for a 27-yard field goal. Before halftime, Oregon State's [[Bill Enyart]] fumbled twice inside Oregon's 10-yard line. Charlie Olds ended the Ducks' best drive of the second quarter by picking off an Eric Olsen pass in the Beaver red zone.

Oregon State's first drive of the second half ended on a Beaver fumble at Oregon's 43. The Ducks capitalized, quickly finding themselves with first-and-goal at the Beaver three. Oregon State's defense did not fold, stopping Oregon a foot short of the end zone on third-and-goal. However, the Ducks dove in on their fourth attempt, increasing their lead to 10â0 with five minutes left in the third quarter. Oregon State was in dire straits after fumbling again at their own 45-yard line. Oregon drove 15 yards but missed a 47-yard field goal. Early in the fourth quarter, Oregon State finally hit their stride. Starting at their own 20, the running game began finding holes over and through the Duck defense. On one third-and-eight, [[Steve Preece]] found [[Don Summers]] for a 35-yard gain. On the next play, Roger Cantlon hauled in a pass at Oregon's one-yard line. From there, Enyart plowed over the Duck defenders and into the end zone, cutting Oregon's lead to 10â7 with nine minutes left. Oregon State's defense responded by forcing Oregon to go three-and-out. The punt only carried to the Beaversâ 45. Nine plays later, Oregon State had the ball first-and-goal on the four yard line. The Ducks loaded up the middle to try to stop Enyart; however, Steve Preece threw them a curve, running around left end for a touchdown with two-and-a-half minutes left, taking the lead 14â10. After getting the ball back, Oregon's final four plays only netted seven yards, turning the ball over to Oregon State. The Ducks did not get the ball back.

===Final standing===
The Civil War victory propelled the Beavers to #7 in the final [[AP Poll]], which was their best ever final ranking. It would take another 33 years for Oregon State to be ranked any higher. Oregon State's 7â2â1 record was its best between 1962 and 2000. It is all the more impressive because the Beavers were only favored to win three of the ten games they played.
