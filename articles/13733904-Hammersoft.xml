In December 2006, the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) attempted to mount multi-pronged attacks in an attempt to capture rebel held territory in Vaharai and Trincomalee districts.

The attack on Vaharai began on the morning of December 4, however, almost immediately as they entered LTTE territory they encountered stiff resistance and were beaten back with 40 killed and more than 75 seriously wounded.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} The LTTE claimed that they only lost 4 fighters.{{Fact|date=January 2009}}

Five days later on December 9, the SLA attacked Eachilampatru from their bases at Kallar and Mahindapura in the Trincomalee district. It was the same. They moved out early in the morning and advanced a half a kilometer into Tiger territory when they were surrounded and attacked by the Tigers.{{Fact|date=January 2009}} More than 30 soldiers were reported to be killed and more than 100 wounded. 2 officers were among the dead.
