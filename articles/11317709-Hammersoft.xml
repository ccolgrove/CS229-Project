===Marching band===
Often accompanying the JSU athletic teams is the university's [[marching band]] and dance line. They are nicknamed the [[Sonic Boom of the South]] and [[J-sette|J-Settes]]. The band was first organized in the early 1940s. As early as the mid-1920s, the University had a well-organized orchestra. The group was given the nickname, âThe Sonic Boom of the Southâ by band members in 1971. In 1971, the majorettes abandoned their batons and became a dance team known as the Prancing J-Settes. In 1974, âGet Ready,â an old Motown favorite was selected as the bandâs theme song. Also, during the mid 1970s, the âTiger Run-Onâ was perfected. The âTiger Run-Onâ is a fast, eye-catching shuffle step that blends an adagio step with an up-tempo shuffle (200 steps per minute), then back to adagioâa âSonic Boomâ trademark that brings fans to their feet during halftime performances. In 2003 the marching band was in enshrined in the NCAA Hall of Champions. Also, the marching band was filmed by Electronic Art Sports (EA Sports) for inclusion in the 2005 version of the video game &quot;EA Sports NCAA Football 2005.&quot;
