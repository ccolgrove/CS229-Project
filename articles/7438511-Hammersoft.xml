The toy company [[Hasbro]] licensed a robot toy from the Japanese [[anime]] series [[Special Armored Batallion Dorvack|Dorvack]] (1983â1984) to sell in the Transformers line under the new name Whirl.

===Marvel Comics===
Whirl was a member of the elite Autobot commando unit known as the Wreckers. He was seen in action in the ''Target: 2006'' storyline (issues 78-88 of the U.K. comic series). Future appearances were limited to background cameos and he did not feature at all in the decimation of the Wreckers in the ''Time Wars'' storyline (issues 199-205 of the U.K. comic).

===Animated series===
Whirl was among those Transformers toys that did not appear in the Transformers animated series because the show was going to appear in Japan, where the toy was owned by Takara's rivals.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Whirl appeared in the second War Within comic series by Dreamwave as a member of the Wreckers led by Springer.

Whirl also appeared alongside Ultra Magnus and Roadbuster at the armory in Generation 1. He then appeared alongside Roadbuster again in a battle against [[Menasor]]. The two was knocked down by Menasor, and whether Whirl survived was unknown.

===Fun Publications===
Based on the ''Classics'' toy line, the ''Timelines'' 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel U.K. and Generation 2 comics). 

Although Whirl has yet to be depicted in the comics, he did have a toy made for the line, which was the basis for his form when he appeared in the Classicverse Lithograph sold of BotCon 2007. In this art he was depicted with ''Generation 1'' Whirl's head.

===IDW Publishing===
Whirl appeared in issue #2 of ''Megatron Origin''. In this story, set on ancient Cybertron he was a member of an Autobot security force in the city of [[Kaon]]. His squad was hunting the operators of gladiatorial contests in the degenerate slums, particularly [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]]. Whirl appeared, in Cybertronian form, in issue #2 of the [[The Transformers: Stormbringer|Stormbringer]] series by [[IDW Publishing]]. He aided [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]]'s Wreckers on the planet [[Varas Centralus]] in the Kol system when [[Optimus Prime]] redeployed the Wreckers for a mission on [[Cybertron]]. They later defeated [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] and his acolytes. Whirl also participated in the battle against [[Thunderwing]] and was later shown inspecting Thunderwing's inert corpse.

Whirl appeared in ''Spotlight: Doubledealer'' where he was among the Autobots fighting [[Thunderwing]] on the planet [[Corata-Vaz]].

===Toys===
*'''''Generation 1'' Deluxe Autobot Whirl''' (1985)
:The toy relicensed from the Japanese [[anime]] series [[Special Armored Batallion Dorvack|Dorvack]].  The original robot was the &quot;''VH-64 MR Oberon Gazzette,''&quot; designed by [[Katsumi Itabashi]] and [[Nobuyoshi Haraba]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised &amp; Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0764313649 | page= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:In the 1980's Transformers were such a success that Hasbro wanted to get as much product out on the shelves with the Transformers name on it as possible. Since they were running out of old Takara molds to use, they obtained licences to use the molds of other companies' robot toys in the Transformers line. Whirl, [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]], [[Jetfire]], [[Omega Supreme]], [[Roadbuster]], [[Insecticons#Deluxe Insecticons|Chop Shop]], [[Insecticons#Deluxe Insecticons|Venom]], [[Barrage (Transformers)|Barrage]] and [[Ransack (Transformers)|Ransack]] were among those molds. With the licences to those toys now expired Hasbro and Takara no longer have legal rights to those figures and cannot reissue them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cobraislandtoys.com/tf/1985/whirl.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Deluxe Autobots were larger and more intricate than most of the other Autobot toys of 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Transformers: Identification and Price Guide |page=52 |author=Mark Bellomo |year=2007 |quote=&quot;Their designs were intricate and their accessories were appropriate, but somehow they seemed a little out of scale with the rest of the Autobots.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The same toy design was imported in the [[Convertors]] toy line in the 1980s as the Defenders Chopper.

*'''''Classics'' Legends Whirl''' (2007)
:A repaint of Micro Class [[Evac]] was released as a homage to Generation 1 Whirl in the Transformers classics toy line.
:The fusilage length of the actual helicopter Whirl is based on is 11.64 meters long. The Micro class version of the toy is only 10.5 centimeters long, giving it a scale of about 1:110. Using this information would indicate Whirl would stand about 23 feet tall in robot mode.
:A Chinese made bootleg of this toy was released in 2007 called &quot;Super Change to United&quot;. This version of the toy was slightly redecoed and remolded so he could become the left arm of a Legends combiner with 4 other Legends bootlegs.

===3H Enterprises===
''Universe'' Whirl appeared among the many prisoners of [[Unicron]] who escaped with the help of [[Optimus Primal]] in ''Transformers: Universe'' #2, but spoke no lines.

===Fun Publications===
Whirl appeared in the text story from [[Fun Publications]] called ''Force of Habit''. On the planet Combatron Whirl and his Mini-Cons are met by the Autobots [[Longrack]], [[Armorhide]], [[Blurr]] and [[Checkpoint (Transformers)|Checkpoint]]. Together they defend a weapons bunker from Decepticons led by [[Brushguard]]. It should be noted in this story it is established that this Whirl is a different Whirl from the ''Generation 1'' character. It also grants new names to his two Mini-Cons. Gunbarrel and Makeshift become [[Thunderstick]] and [[Skysickle]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transformersclub.com/force-of-habitv3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the comic story found in issue #8 of the Transformers Collectors Club magazine ''Cybertron/Robots in Disguise'' [[Optimus Prime (Robots in Disguise)|Optimus Prime]] told the story of the last battle he was in, set in the Transformers: Universe storyline. Alongside ''10th Anniversary'' [[Optimus Primal]] they attacked the last of [[Unicron]]'s forces when Unicron suddenly disappeared, and they barely escaped. Among the Autobot forces was ''Universe'' Whirl and his commander King Atlas.
