==Rules and regulations==
The tournament is divided into a group stage and a knockout stage. In the group stage, teams face each other in a single [[round-robin tournament]]. At the end of the group stage, the top four teams qualify for the semi-finals. The semi-finals are best-of-three playoffs, with the top seed facing the fourth seed and the second seed facing the third seed. If a match in the knockout stage ends with a tie, a [[Super Over]] will determine the winner. The winners of the semi-finals play a single final match to determine the winner of the tournament.

For each group stage match, the host of the match alternates between tournaments. Each team hosts either two or three of their five matches. In the knockout stage, the higher seed hosts the second and third (if required) matches while the lower seed hosts the first match.

Points were awarded as follows in the group stage:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

!Result!!Points
|-
| Win, with bonus point || 5 points
|-
| Win, without bonus point || 4 points
|-
| Tie || 3 points

| No result || 2 points
|-
| Loss || 0 points
|}

* The team that achieves a [[run rate]] of 1.25 times that of the opposition shall be rewarded one bonus point.
* A team's run rate will be calculated by reference to the runs scored in an innings divided by the number of overs faced.
* Points are deducted for slow over rate at 1 point per over not completed within the allotted 90 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardbank.co.za/site/pro20/rules.html |title=Standard Bank Pro20 Series â playing conditions |publisher=Standard Bank |accessdate=2011-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
