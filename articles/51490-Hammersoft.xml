{{Rights}} 
'''Rights''' are legal, social, or ethical [[principle]]s of [[Liberty|freedom]] or [[entitlement]]; that is, rights are the fundamental [[normative]] rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people, according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory. Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as [[law]] and [[ethics]], especially theories of [[justice]] and [[deontology]].

Rights are often considered fundamental to [[civilization]], being regarded as established pillars of [[society]] and [[culture]], and the history of [[social conflict]]s can be found in the history of each right and its development. The connection between rights and struggle cannot be overstated â rights are not as much granted or endowed as they are fought for and claimed, and the essence of struggles past and ancient are encoded in the spirit of current concepts of rights and their modern formulations.

==Etymology==

The [[Modern English]] word ''right'' derives from [[Old English]] ''riht'' or ''reht'', in turn from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*riÏtaz'' meaning &quot;right&quot; or &quot;direct&quot;, and ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*reg-to-'' meaning &quot;having moved in a straight line&quot;, in turn from ''*(o)reg'(a)-'' meaning &quot;to straighten or direct&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:right]]&lt;/ref&gt; In several different [[Indo-European languages]], a single word derived from the same root means both &quot;right&quot; and &quot;law&quot;, such as French ''droit'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:droit]]&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ''derecho'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:derecho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and German ''recht''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:recht]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other words related to normative or regulatory concepts derive from this same root, including ''correct'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:correct]]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''regulate'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regulate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rex''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rex#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning &quot;king&quot;), whence ''regal''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:regal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and thence ''royal''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:royal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise many more geometric terms derive from this same root, such as ''erect'' (as in &quot;upright&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:erect]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''rectangle'' (literally &quot;[[right angle]]&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rectangle]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''straight''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:straight]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''stretch''.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:stretch]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''right'', the English words ''rule''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:rule]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ruler'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ruler]]&lt;/ref&gt; deriving still from the same root, have both normative or regulatory and geometric meanings (e.g. a ruler as in a king, or a ruler as in a straightedge).

Several other roots have similar normative and geometric descendants, such as Latin ''norma'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norma#latin]]&lt;/ref&gt; whence ''[[norm (philosophy)|norm]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:norm]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''normal'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normal]]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''normative''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:normative]]&lt;/ref&gt; itself, and also geometric concepts such as ''[[surface normal]]s''; and likewise Greek ''ortho''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ortho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin ''ordo'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordo]]&lt;/ref&gt; meaning either &quot;right&quot; or &quot;correct&quot; (as in ''orthodox'', meaning &quot;correct opinion&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthodox]]&lt;/ref&gt;) or &quot;straight&quot; or &quot;perpendicular&quot; (as in ''orthogonal'', meaning &quot;perpendicular angle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:orthogonal]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and thence ''order'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:order]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''ordinary'',&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:ordinary]]&lt;/ref&gt; etc.

==A wide variety of meanings==
[[File:RNC 04 protest 89.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street protest scene; people deliberately lying down on a busy city street, surrounded by onlookers and police|Rights are widely regarded as the basis of law, but what if laws are bad? Some theorists suggest [[civil disobedience]] is, itself, a ''right'', and it was advocated by thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Gandhi]].]]
There is considerable disagreement about what is meant precisely by the term ''rights''. It has been used by different groups and thinkers for different purposes, with different and sometimes opposing definitions, and the precise definition of this principle, beyond having something to do with normative rules of some sort or another, is controversial.

One way to get an idea of the multiple understandings and senses of the term is to consider different ways it is used. Many diverse things are claimed as rights: {{cquote|A right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to strike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate a forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel proud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender to death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to carry a concealed weapon, to a distinct genetic identity; a right to believe one's own eyes, to pronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell in one's own way.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = Rights dominate most modern understandings of what actions are proper and which institutions are just. Rights structure the forms of our governments, the contents of our laws, and the shape of morality as we perceive it. To accept a set of rights is to approve a distribution of freedom and authority, and so to endorse a certain view of what may, must, and must not be done.

|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There are likewise diverse possible ways to categorize rights, such as:
{{cquote|''Who'' is alleged to have the right: Children's rights, animal rights, workers' rights, states' rights, the rights of peoples. ''What actions or states or objects'' the asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass judgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily rights. ''Why'' the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights spring from moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of the society, customary rights are aspects of local customs. ''How the asserted right can be affected'' by the rightholder's actions: The inalienable right to life, the forfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be kept.&lt;ref name=tws21decgghg/&gt;}}
There has been considerable debate about what this term means within the academic community, particularly within fields such as [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[deontology]], [[logic]], and [[political science]]. One way to look at different senses of the term of ''rights'' is to examine contrasting ideas about the concept.

===Natural rights versus legal rights===
[[File:Brueghel Jan II God creating.jpg|thumb|right|alt=painting of a dark gray skies with trees and water, and a human image, flying, with arms outstretched|According to some views, certain rights derive from [[God]] or [[Nature]]]]
{{Main|Natural and legal rights}}
* '''Natural rights''' are rights which are &quot;natural&quot; in the sense of &quot;not artificial, not man-made&quot;, as in rights deriving from [[deontic logic]], from [[human nature]], or from the [[divine command theory|edicts of a god]]. They are universal; that is, they apply to all people, and do not derive from the laws of any specific society. They exist necessarily, inhere in every individual, and can't be taken away. For example, it has been argued that humans have a natural ''right to life''. They're sometimes called ''[[natural and legal rights|moral rights]]'' or ''inalienable rights''.

* '''Legal rights''', in contrast, are based on a society's customs, laws, [[statute]]s or actions by [[legislature]]s. An example of a legal right is the ''right to vote'' of citizens. [[Citizenship]], itself, is often considered as the basis for having legal rights, and has been defined as the &quot;right to have rights&quot;. Legal rights are sometimes called ''[[civil rights]]'' or ''statutory rights'' and are culturally and politically [[moral relativism|relative]] since they depend on a specific societal context to have meaning.

Some thinkers see rights in only one sense while others accept that both senses have a measure of validity. There has been considerable philosophical debate about these senses throughout history. For example, [[Jeremy Bentham]] believed that legal rights were the essence of rights, and he denied the existence of natural rights; whereas [[Thomas Aquinas]] held that rights purported by [[positive law]] but not grounded in [[natural law]] were not properly rights at all, but only a facade or pretense of rights.

===Claim rights versus liberty rights===
[[File:Chorin deed 1273.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a deed which has hand-written writing on a yellowed piece of paper with three gold tassles at the bottom|A [[deed]] is an example of a ''claim right'' in the sense that it asserts a ''right'' to own land. This particular deed dates back to 1273.]]
{{Main|Claim rights and liberty rights}}
* A '''claim right''' is a right which entails that another person has a duty to the right-holder. Somebody else must do or refrain from doing something to or for the ''claim holder'', such as perform a service or supply a product for him or her; that is, he or she has a ''claim'' to that service or product (another term is ''[[thing in action]]''). In logic, this idea can be expressed as: &quot;Person ''A'' has a claim that person ''B'' do something if and only if ''B'' has a duty to ''A'' to do that something.&quot; Every claim-right entails that some other duty-bearer must do some duty for the claim to be satisfied. This duty can be to act or to refrain from acting. For example, many jurisdictions recognize broad claim rights to things like &quot;life, liberty, and property&quot;; these rights impose an obligation upon others ''not'' to assault or restrain a person, or use their property, without the claim-holder's permission. Likewise, in jurisdictions where social welfare services are provided, citizens have legal claim rights to be provided with those services.

* A '''liberty right''' or ''privilege'', in contrast, is simply a freedom or permission for the right-holder to do something, and there are ''no obligations'' on other parties to do or not do anything. This can be expressed in logic as: &quot;Person ''A'' has a privilege to do something if and only if ''A'' has no duty not to do that something.&quot; For example, if a person has a legal liberty right to free speech, that merely means that it is not legally forbidden for them to speak freely: it does ''not'' mean that anyone has to help enable their speech, or to listen to their speech; or even, per se, refrain from stopping them from speaking, though ''other'' rights, such as the claim right to be free from assault, may severely limit what others can do to stop them.

Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so. Likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, then that other person's liberty is limited. For example, a person has a ''liberty right'' to walk down a sidewalk and can decide freely whether or not to do so, since there is no obligation either to do so or to refrain from doing so. But pedestrians may have an obligation not to walk on certain lands, such as other people's private property, to which those other people have a claim right. So a person's ''liberty right'' of walking extends precisely to the point where another's ''claim right'' limits his or her freedom.

===Positive rights versus negative rights===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
In one sense, a right is a permission to do something or an entitlement to a specific service or treatment, and these rights have been called ''positive rights''. However, in another sense, rights may allow or require inaction, and these are called ''negative rights''; they permit or require doing nothing. For example, in some democracies e.g. the US, citizens have the ''positive right'' to vote and they have the ''negative right'' not to vote; people can stay home and watch [[television]] instead, if they desire. In other democracies e.g. [[Australia]], however, citizens have a positive right to vote but they don't have a negative right to not vote, since non-voting citizens can be fined. Accordingly:

* '''Positive rights''' are permissions to do things, or entitlements to be done unto. One example of a positive right is the purported &quot;right to welfare.&quot;&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf/&gt;

* '''Negative rights''' are permissions not to do things, or entitlements to be left alone. Often the distinction is invoked by [[libertarianism|libertarians]] who think of a ''negative right'' as an entitlement to &quot;non-interference&quot; such as a right against being assaulted.&lt;ref name=tws21decgkfjf&gt;{{cite news
|title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
|quote = A distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among some normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward libertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.
|publisher = ''Stanford University''
|date = July 9, 2007
|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/
|accessdate = 2009-12-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though similarly named, positive and negative rights should not be confused with ''active rights'' (which encompass &quot;privileges&quot; and &quot;powers&quot;) and ''passive rights'' (which encompass &quot;claims&quot; and &quot;immunities&quot;).

===Individual rights versus group rights===
{{Main|Individual and group rights}}
The general concept of rights is that they are possessed by individuals in the sense that they are permissions and entitlements to do things which other persons, or which governments or authorities, can not infringe. This is the understanding of people such as the author [[Ayn Rand]] who argued that only individuals have rights, according to her &quot;philosophy&quot; known as [[Objectivism]].&lt;ref name=tws18decafafa&gt;{{cite news
|author = Ayn Rand
|title = The Virtue of Selfishness: Individual Rights
|quote = Individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the individual). see page 104. See also: [[Group_rights#Objectivist_view|Collectivized 'Rights]]
|publisher = ''The Ayn Rand Lexicon''
|date = 2009-12-18
|url = http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html
|accessdate = 2009-12-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that there are situations in which a group of persons is thought to have rights, or ''group rights''. Accordingly:

* '''Individual rights''' are rights held by individual people regardless of their group membership or lack thereof.
[[File:Malian Soldiers.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soldiers lined up in a row, with green caps, carrying rifles|Do groups have ''rights''? Some argue that when soldiers bond in [[combat]], the group becomes like an organism in itself and has ''rights'' which trump the rights of any individual soldier.]]

* '''Group rights''' have been argued to exist when a group is seen as more than a mere composite or assembly of separate individuals but an entity in its own right. In other words, it's possible to see a group as a distinct being in and of itself; it's akin to an enlarged individual which has a distinct will and power of action and can be thought of as having ''rights''. For example, a platoon of soldiers in [[combat]] can be thought of as a distinct group, since individual members are willing to risk their lives for the survival of the group, and therefore the group can be conceived as having a &quot;right&quot; which is superior to that of any individual member; for example, a soldier who disobeys an officer can be punished, perhaps even killed, for a breach of obedience.  But there is another sense of group rights in which people who are members of a group can be thought of as having specific individual rights because of their membership in a group. In this sense, the set of rights which individuals-as-group-members have is expanded because of their membership in a group. For example, workers who are members of a group such as a [[Trade union|labor union]] can be thought of as having expanded individual rights because of their membership in the labor union, such as the rights to specific working conditions or wages. As expected, there is sometimes considerable disagreement about what exactly is meant by the term &quot;group&quot; as well as by the term &quot;group rights.&quot;

There can be tension between individual and group rights. A classic instance in which group and individual rights clash is conflicts between unions and their members. For example, individual members of a union may wish a wage higher than the union-negotiated wage, but are prevented from making further requests; in a so-called [[closed shop]] which has a [[union security agreement]], only the union has a ''right'' to decide matters for the individual union members such as wage rates. So, do the supposed &quot;individual rights&quot; of the workers prevail about the proper wage? Or do the &quot;group rights&quot; of the union regarding the proper wage prevail? Clearly this is a source of tension.

===Other senses===
Other distinctions between rights draw more on historical association or [[family resemblance]] than on precise philosophical distinctions. These include the distinction between '''[[civil and political rights]]''' and '''[[economic, social and cultural rights]]''', between which the articles of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] are often divided. Another conception of rights groups them into '''[[three generations of human rights|three generations]]'''. These distinctions have much overlap with that between [[negative and positive rights]], as well as between [[individual rights]] and [[group rights]], but these groupings are not entirely coextensive.

==Rights and politics==
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|alt=three police officers surround a man in a tee shirt who is handcuffed|In the [[United States]], a person who is going to be questioned by police when he or she is in police custody must be read his or her &quot;Miranda rights&quot;. The [[Miranda warning]] assumes people don't understand what their rights are so it requires police officers to read a statement to people being arrested which informs them that they have certain rights, such as the right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney.]]
Rights are often included in the foundational questions governments and politics have been designed to deal with. Often the development of these socio-political institutions have formed a dialectical relationship with rights.

Rights about particular issues, or the rights of particular groups, are often areas of special concern. Often these concerns arise when rights come into conflict with other legal or moral issues, sometimes even other rights.  Issues of concern have historically included [[labor rights]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]], [[reproductive rights]], [[disability rights]], [[patient rights]] and [[prisoners' rights]].  With increasing [[mass surveillance|monitoring]] and the information society, [[digital rights|information rights]], such as the right to [[privacy]] are becoming more important.

Some examples of groups whose rights are of particular concern include [[animal rights|animals]],&lt;ref name=tws21decghnnb&gt;{{cite news

Accordingly, politics plays an important role in developing or recognizing the above rights, and the discussion about which behaviors are included as &quot;rights&quot; is an ongoing political topic of importance. The concept of rights varies with political orientation. Positive rights such as a &quot;right to medical care&quot; are emphasized more often by left-leaning thinkers, while right-leaning thinkers place more emphasis on negative rights such as the &quot;right to a fair trial&quot;.

Further, the term ''equality'' which is often bound up with the meaning of &quot;rights&quot; often depends on one's political orientation. [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and advocates of [[free markets]] often identify equality with [[equality of opportunity]], and want equal and fair rules in the process of making things, while agreeing that sometimes these fair rules lead to unequal outcomes. In contrast, [[socialism|socialists]] often identify equality with [[equality of outcome]] and see fairness when people have equal amounts of goods and services, and therefore think that people have a right to equal portions of necessities such as [[health care]] or [[Welfare|economic assistance]] or [[House|housing]].&lt;ref name=tws21dece563e&gt;{{cite news

|title = Roemer on equality of opportunity
|quote = Equality of opportunity is to be contrasted with equality of outcome. While advocacy of the latter has been traditionally associated with a left-wing political philosophy, the former has been championed by conservative political philosophy. Equality of outcome fails to hold individuals responsible for imprudent actions that may, absent redress, reduce the values of the outcomes they enjoy, or for wise actions that would raise the value of the outcomes above the levels of othersâ. Equality of opportunity, in contrast, âlevels the playing field,â so that all have the potential to achieve the same outcomes; whether or not, in the event, they do, depends upon individual choice.

==History of rights==
{{see also|History of human rights}}
[[Image:Magna Carta.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Magna Carta]]'' or &quot;Great Charter&quot; was one of England's first documents containing commitments by a [[monarch|sovereign]] to his people to respect certain [[law|legal]] rights. It reduced the power of the monarch.]]
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of a painting; the painting is of a written declaration; there are two human images to the left and right; it says &quot;Declaration des droits de l'homme&quot; (declaration of the rights of man)|The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in 1789 in [[France]].]]

The specific enumeration of rights has differed greatly in different periods of history. In many cases, the system of rights promulgated by one group has come into sharp and bitter conflict with that of other groups. In the political sphere, a place in which rights have historically been an important issue, at present the question of who has what legal rights is sometimes addressed by the constitutions of the respective nations.

Most historic notions of rights were [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], with different people being granted different rights, and some having more rights than others. For instance, the right of a father to be respected by his son did not indicate a [[duty]] upon the father to return that respect, and the [[divine right of kings]] which permitted absolute power over subjects did not leave room for many rights to be granted to the subjects themselves.&lt;ref name=tws21decfrre&gt;{{cite news
|title = Divine Right of Kings
|quote = The idea that a monarch could heal with his touch flowed from the idea that a king was sacred, appointed by God and above the judgment of earthly powers. It was called the Divine Right of Kings and it entered so powerfully into British culture during the 17th century that it shaped the pomp and circumstance of the Stuart monarchs, imbued the writing of Shakespeare and provoked the political thinking of Milton and Locke.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, modern conceptions of rights often emphasize [[liberty]] and [[Egalitarianism|equality]] as among the most important aspects of rights, though conceptions of liberty (e.g. [[positive liberty|positive]] or [[negative liberty|negative]]) and equality (e.g. of [[equality of opportunity|opportunity]] or of [[equality of outcome|outcome]]) frequently differ.

Important documents in the political history of rights include:
* The [[Constitution of Medina]] (622 AD; Arabia) instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina,&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Serjeant, ''The Sunnah Jami'ah, pacts with the Yathrib Jews, and the Tahrim of Yathrib: Analysis and translation of the documents comprised in the so-called &quot;Constitution of Medina.&quot; Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 41, No. 1. (1978), page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; establishing freedom of worship for non-Muslims in return for extra taxes (the [[jizya]]), the security of women, a system for granting protection of individuals, and a judicial system.
* The [[Magna Carta]] (1215; England) required the [[monarch|King]] of England to renounce certain rights and respect certain legal procedures, and to accept that the will of the king could be bound by [[law]].
* The [[Henrician Articles]] (1573; Poland-Lithuania) or King Henry's Articles were a permanent contract that stated the fundamental principles of governance and constitutional law in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including the rights of the nobility  to elect the king, to meet in parliament whose approval was required to levy taxes and declare war or peace, to religious liberty and the right to rebel in case the king transgressed against the laws of the republic or the rights of the nobility.
* The [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1689; England) declared that [[Englishmen]], as embodied by [[Parliament]], possess certain civil and political rights; the [[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]] (1689; Scotland) was similar but distinct.
* The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (1789; France) was one of the fundamental documents of the [[French Revolution]], defining a set of individual rights and collective rights of the people.
* The [[United States Bill of Rights]] (1789&amp;ndash;1791; United States), the first ten amendments of the [[United States Constitution]] specified rights of individuals in which government could not interfere, including the rights of free assembly, freedom of religion, trial by jury, and so forth.
* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (1948) is an over-arching set of standards by which governments, organisations and individuals would measure their behaviour towards each other.  The preamble declares that the &quot;...recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[justice]] and [[peace]] in the world...&quot;
* The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (1950; Europe) was adopted under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]] to protect [[human right]]s and fundamental freedoms.
* The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966) is a follow-up to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], concerning [[civil and political rights]].
* The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (1966) is another follow-up to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], concerning [[economic, social and cultural rights]].
* The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (1982; Canada) was created to protect the rights of [[Canada|Canadian]] citizens from actions and policies of all levels of government.
* The [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] (2000) is one of the most recent proposed legal instruments concerning human rights.
