'''Knoppix''', or '''KNOPPIX''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|áµ|Ë|n|É|p|Éª|k|s}} {{respell|k|NOP|iks}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.debian.org/debian-knoppix/2003/01/msg00173.html Two Weughty Questions] on Debian newsgroup post&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[operating system]] based on [[Debian]] designed to be run directly from a [[Compact Disc|CD]] / [[DVD]] ([[Live CD]]) or a [[USB key]] ([[Live USB]]), one of the first of its kind for any operating system. Knoppix was developed by Linux consultant [[Klaus Knopper]]. When starting a program, it is loaded from the removable medium and decompressed into a [[RAM drive]]. The decompression is [[transparency (human-computer interaction)|transparent]] and [[on-the-fly#Computer_usage|on-the-fly]].

Although Knoppix is primarily designed to be used as a Live CD, it can also be installed on a [[hard disk]] like a typical operating system. Computers that support booting from USB devices can load Knoppix from a live USB [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] or [[memory card]].

There are two main editions of Knoppix: the traditional Compact Disc (700 [[megabyte]]s) edition and the DVD (4.7 [[gigabyte]]s) &quot;Maxi&quot; edition. Each of these main editions have two language-specific editions: English and German.

Knoppix mostly consists of [[free and open source software]], but also includes [[proprietary software]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/General_FAQ#Q:_Why_is_my_favourite_software_xyz_not_present_on_the_CD.3F_Can.27t_you_add_it_in_future_versions_of_the_download_version.3F_It_doesn.27t_cost_anything.21 Knoppix FAQ-Wiki pages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Knoppix can be used to copy files easily from hard drives with inaccessible operating systems. To quickly and more safely use Linux software, the Live CD can be used instead of installing another OS.

== Contents ==

[[Image:KNOPPIX booting.png|thumb|Knoppix start-up process]]
More than 1000 software packages are included on the CD edition and more than 2600 are included on the DVD edition. Up to 9 gigabytes can be stored on the DVD in [[data compression|compressed]] form.
These packages include:
* [[LXDE]] (lightweight [[X11]] [[desktop environment]] [default for 6.0.1]) or [[KDE 3]], a more feature-complete desktop (default for 5.3.1).
* [[MPlayer]], with [[MP3]] audio, and [[Ogg Vorbis]] audio playback support
* [[Internet access]] software, including the [[KPPP]] dialer and [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] utilities
* The [[Iceweasel]] web browser (based on [[Mozilla Firefox]])
* The [[Icedove]] e-mail client (based on [[Mozilla Thunderbird]])
* [[GIMP]], an image manipulation program
* Tools for data rescue and system repair
* Network analysis and administration tools
* [[LibreOffice]], a comprehensive [[office suite]]
* [[Terminal server]]

== Hardware requirements ==
* Intel-compatible processor (i486 or later)
* 32 MB of RAM for text mode, at least 64 MB for graphics mode with LXDE (at least 128 MB of RAM is recommended to use the various office products)
* Bootable CD-ROM drive, or a boot floppy and standard CD-ROM (IDE/ATAPI or SCSI)
* Standard SVGA-compatible graphics card
* Serial or PS/2 standard mouse or IMPS/2-compatible USB-mouse

== Saving changes in the environment ==
Prior to Knoppix 3.8.2, any documents or settings a user created would disappear upon reboot. This lack of permanence made it necessary to save documents explicitly to a hard drive partition, over the network, or to some [[removable medium]], such as a USB flash drive.

It was also possible to set up a &quot;persistent home directory&quot;, where any documents or settings written to the user's home directory would automatically be redirected to a hard drive or removable medium, which could be automatically [[Mount point|mounted]] on bootup. What is stored there physically is a file called ''knoppix.img''. The file is used to simulate a file system into which files are written for later use. This is transparent for the user. What the user perceives is that it is possible to write files to the home directory.

[[Union mount]] support was added in version 3.8.1 through [[UnionFS]].  This was later replaced in 5.1.0 by [[Aufs]] to improve stability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.uni-kl.de/pub/linux/knoppix/KNOPPIX-CHANGELOG.txt Changelog]&lt;/ref&gt;   The union mount allows virtual updates to the data on the read-only CD/DVD medium by storing changes on a separate writable medium and then representing the combination of the two as single [[Computer data storage|storage device]].  The writable medium can be memory ([[ramdisk]]), a hard disk, USB flash drive, etc.  This means that the user can modify the software installed on the Knoppix system, such as by using [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] to install or update software.  The storage device containing the changes needs to be present whenever Knoppix is started else only the original data from the disc will be used.

By default Knoppix will scan available storage devices for a persistent home directory, but you can override this scan and provide a specific location with a boot option ([[#Boot options|see below]]) such as:

&lt;code&gt;home=/dev/hda1/knoppix.img&lt;/code&gt; 
&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheat codes&quot;&gt;[http://knoppix.net/wiki/Cheat_Codes Knoppix Documentation Wiki:Cheat codes]&lt;/ref&gt;

By carrying a Knoppix CD and a USB flash drive, a user can have the same environment, programs, settings, and data available on any computer that is Knoppix-compatible.

== Boot options ==
When using Knoppix as a Live CD, one can use boot options, also known as 'cheatcodes', to override a default setting or automatic hardware detection when it fails. For example, the user may wish to boot into a plain console, or proceed without SCSI support. For this, Knoppix allows the user to enter one or more cheat codes at the prompt before booting. If the user does not enter a cheat code, or does not press any key before the timeout, Knoppix will boot with its default options. For example, to set the language to French rather than the default, one would type:

&lt;code&gt;knoppix lang=fr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheat codes&quot;/&gt;

== Popularity ==
Knoppix was one of the first Live CD Linux distributions to gain popularity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://polishlinux.org/choose/live-cd/ polishlinux.org â Live CD]&lt;/ref&gt; There are several factors that contribute to the popularity of Knoppix:
* Knoppix was one of the first Live CDs available, and is known as the &quot;original&quot; Debian-based Live CD
* Its extensive hardware detection allows most systems to start Knoppix without any configuration
* Its ability to automatically connect to most kinds of [[Computer network|networks]]
* Its utilities for system repair and troubleshooting

Knoppix works on a fairly large number of PCs or laptops, but not all. The automatic hardware detection cannot cope with all hardware, and sometimes the drivers used will not be optimal. Knoppix has difficulty recognizing some cards made before 1998, or motherboards with a BIOS made before 2002. (In some cases, manual configuration with codes entered at boot time can overcome problems with automatic detection.)

If a PC does not have enough RAM to run KDE and other included programs, Knoppix boots up a very limited [[twm]] session instead. The only window running in the twm session by default is xterm.

== Versions ==
As of April 2008, from version 4 up until 5.1.1, Knoppix has been split into a DVD &quot;maxi&quot; edition (with over 9 GB of software), and a CD &quot;light&quot; edition, both developed in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Knopper |first=Klaus |title=KNOPPIX 4.0 in issue 8/05 ''with DVD'' of &amp;ldquo;com!

The KNOPPIX 6.0.1 / ADRIANE 1.1 is a CD-edition again, and a complete rebuild from scratch. LXDE as default desktop and a very reduced software collection in order to easily fit on CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Knopper |first=Klaus |title=Microknoppix |work=KNOPPIX 6.0 / ADRIANE 1.1 â Live CD |publisher=Knopper.Net |date=2009-02-11 |url=http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/knoppix60-en.html |accessdate=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
No further development is being done of the traditional 5.x versions.

The KNOPPIX 6.2.1 release, both CD and DVD, and the ADRIANE 1.2 has just CD-edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Microknoppix |work=KNOPPIX 6.2 / ADRIANE 1.2 â Live CD / DVD |publisher=Knopper.Net |url=http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/knoppix62-en.html |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivatives ==
=== Adriane Knoppix ===
Adriane Knoppix is a variation that is intended for [[Blindness|blind]] and [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people, which can be used entirely without vision oriented output devices. It was released in the third quarter of 2007 as a Live CD. ''Adriane Knoppix'' is named after Adriane Knopper, the wife of Klaus Knopper, the developer of Knoppix. Adriane has a visual impairment, and has been assisting Klaus with the development of the software.&lt;ref&gt;Swapnil Bhartiya, EFY News, [http://www.efytimes.com/efytimes/fullnews.asp?edid=17094 Free Operating System For Blind: Adriane Knoppix] accessed 2 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The name Adriane is also a [[backronym]] for &quot;Audio Desktop Reference Implementation And Networking Environment&quot;.

Adriane Knoppix is intended not only for the blind but also for beginners who donât know much about computers. It uses the [[SUSE Linux distributions|SUSE]] Blinux [[screen reader]] with a [[phoneme]] generator and speech engine for normal output.

=== Other variations ===
* [[Kaella]], The French translation of Knoppix.
* [[KnoppMyth]], a distro that attempts to make the Linux and [[MythTV]] installation as trivial as possible
* [[Musix GNU+Linux]], specifically for musicians
* [[PHLAK]], a Live security distribution based on Morphix.
* [[Quantian]], for statisticians

====Unmaintained projects====
* [[Auditor Security Collection]], intended to test the security of networks (merged into [[BackTrack]])
* [[ClusterKnoppix]], which uses [[openMosix]]
* [[Feather Linux]], 128 MB image with Linux 2.4, works as a Live CD and Live USB
* [[Knoppix STD]] (Security Tools Distribution), which focuses on [[computer security]] tools
* [[Kurumin]], in [[Brazilian Portuguese]]
