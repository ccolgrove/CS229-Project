==History==
Prior to 1940, the area was part of the Arabian sea. A popular leader of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], Khurshid Nariman (''affectionately called Veer Nariman''), a [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation]] corporator, proposed to reclaim the area from the sea near [[Churchgate]]. To accomplish this task, debris from various parts of the city was dumped here and the shallow sea coast was filled. Reinforced concrete cement was used, of which the imported steel used was obtained from the black market at a higher price due to the [[World War II]].The entire cost was estimated to be {{INR}}3 [[lakh]]s or {{INR}}300,000 (now {{INR}}10 [[crore]]s or {{INR}}100,000,000) Additional reclamations were carried out in the 1970s. A construction boom in that decade saw this region spurting many commercial high-rises.
