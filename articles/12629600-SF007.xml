==History==
A trademark application for the name &quot;Nexus One&quot; was filed by Google, Inc. on December 10, 2009. The Nexus One trademark was filed in International Trademark Class 9 for &quot;Computer &amp; Software Products &amp; Electrical &amp; Scientific Products&quot; with description of &quot;Mobile phones&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidos.in/2009/12/google-gets-nexus-one-trademarked.html |title=Exclusive: Google files for 'Nexus One' Trademark |publisher=Androidos.in |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2010 it was announced that the application had been declined due to the mark already being granted on December 30, 2008 to Integra Telecom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nexus-one.co.uk/post/449889239/google-runs-into-a-problem-with-nexus-one-trademark |title=Google runs into a problem with Nexus One trademark application |publisher=nexus-one.co.uk |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2009, Google confirmed in a blog post that they had begun internal testing of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlemobile.blogspot.com/2009/12/android-dogfood-diet-for-holidays.html |title=Official Google Mobile Blog: An Android dogfood diet for the holidays |publisher=Googlemobile.blogspot.com |date=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google stated that a &quot;mobile lab device&quot; had been given to its employees, at that time Google had not yet confirmed that a device would be sold to consumers. Wireless phone and data services for the device were not activated nor billed to Google; it was up to the employees to activate and pay for wireless service on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexusoneforum.net/forum/nexus-one-google-phone-news/58-how-do-googlers-activate-nexus-one-just-like-you-i.html |title=How do Googlers activate the Nexus One?

Isa Dick Hackett, daughter of [[Philip K. Dick]], and several bloggers believe the name Nexus One is a reference to the novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], in which there are androids with a model designation of &quot;Nexus-6&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/is-the-google-phone-an-unauthorized-replicant/ |title=Is the Google Phone an Unauthorized Replicant? |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2009-12-15 |accessdate=2010-05-31 | first=Jenna | last=Wortham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/12/nexus-did-google-dream-of-electric-lawsuits/ |title=Nexus: Did Google Dream of Electric Lawsuits? |publisher=wired.com |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2010-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
===In the United States===
The Nexus One was released on January 5, 2010. The phone was sold via Google's website, at a price of $529 without a plan or contract, or a subsidized $179 when purchased with a [[T-Mobile USA]] two year contract.&lt;ref name=onsale&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidtapp.com/google-phone-nexus-one-available-for-sale/|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Google Phone Nexus One Available for Sale!|publisher=[[AndroidTapp.com]]|date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google announced in May 2010 that the online store would close, and the phone would be offered in retail stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobilemarketingnews.co.uk/Google_Pulls_Nexus_One_from_Online_Retail_65179130268.html Mobile Marketing news: Google Pulls Nexus One from Online Retail]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-20005015-265.html CNET Google turns Nexus One strategy upside down]&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 21, 2010, the Nexus One is available through retail stores from i wireless&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwireless.com/phones_detail.asp?pid=171 i wireless - Phones - Google Nexus One â 3G&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Cincinnati Bell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cincinnatibell.com/consumer/wireless/phones_and_devices/?id=htc_nexusone Cincinnati Bell Wireless Phones &amp; Devices Cincinnati&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|T-Mobile}} T-Mobile USA====
Several plans were available for subsidized phones:

* $79.99 per month rate, which includes 500 minutes with unlimited nights and weekends, unlimited [[SMS]], and unlimited e-mail/data.
* $89.99 and unlimited minutes, unlimited [[SMS]], and unlimited e-mail/data.
Unsubsidized phones had no such limitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/phone/choose?locale=en_US&amp;s7e=|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Nexus One Phone|publisher=[[Google]]}} {{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/cell-phone-plans-detail.aspx?tp=tb1&amp;rateplan=Even-More-Plus-Unlimited-Talk-Text-Web |title=Even More Plus Unlimited Talk + Text + Web Rate Plan: Even More Plus Unlimited Talk + Text + Web details |publisher=T-mobile.com |date=2008-12-07 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The $179 T-Mobile USA price is only for individuals who are not currently under contract with T-Mobile USA. If one currently has a T-Mobile USA contract, the price of the phone rises to $279.99.&lt;ref name=leak&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5436673/leaked-nexus-one-documents-530-unlocked-180-with-t+mobile|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Leaked Nexus One Documents: $530 Unlocked, $180 With T-Mobile - Nexus one|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/Plans/Cell-Phone-Plans.aspx?catgroup=EvenMorePlus|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Cell Phone Plans: T-Mobile rate plans-cell phones, wireless plans, BlackBerry, Sidekick|publisher=[[T-mobile]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, tax may be charged depending on the state to which the device is shipped. Each order is shipped with free FedEx Overnight shipping (although, when checking your order status with FedEX you may note that it was sent FedEx 2-Day), with indirect signature required. With engraving delivery can be delayed up to 72 hours.

Google removed a price level of $379.99 for current T-mobile USA customers who had a data plan. Those who ordered the phone for $379.99 were refunded $100USD.

T-Mobile USA contract plans cost $20 per month more than non-contract plans.

For unlocked phones, T-Mobile USA offers a Prepaid SIM Card Activation Kit. T-Mobile USA's website offers it at discounted price of $6.99&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2010-12-06|url=http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/Phones/cell-phone-detail.aspx?class=prepaid&amp;cell-phone=Prepaid-T-Mobile-SIM-Activation-Kit|author=T-Mobile|title=T-Mobile Prepaid SIM Card Activation Kit}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or free&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/Cell-Phone-Detail.aspx?cell-phone=T-Mobile-SIM-Card|accessdate=2010-12-06|author=T-Mobile|title=T-Mobile SIM Card Activation Kit with contract}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 2 year contract). Voice-only no-contract plans are available at several price points including $100 for 1000 minutes good for a year. Airtime is sold online, by phone, or at retail stores.

====AT&amp;T====
A version of the Nexus One with support for UMTS 850/1900/2100 MHz was first made available on March 16, 2010. (These UMTS bands are used by AT&amp;T in the U.S. and Rogers in Canada.)

====Verizon====
When the Nexus One was first announced in January 2010, Google said that a Verizon model would be made available later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Will the Sprint Google Nexus One be dropped soon too? |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/cell-phones/will-the-sprint-google-nexus-one-be-dropped-soon-too/3759 |author=Matthew Miller | date= May 6, 2010 |publisher=ZDNet.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; But in late April 2010, Google announced that &quot;We won't be selling a Nexus One with Verizon ...&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=April 26, 2010 |title=Verizon dumps Nexus One for Droid Incredible? |author=Bonnie Cha |url=http://www.cnet.com/8301-19736_1-20003397-251.html |publisher=cnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and told users who wanted the Nexus One on Verizon to get the HTC [[Droid Incredible]], &quot;a powerful new Android phone and a cousin of the Nexus One that is similarly feature-packed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googlenexusoneboard.blogspot.com/2010/04/update-on-nexus-one-partnerships.html | date=April 26, 2010 |title=An update on Nexus One partnerships |publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sprint====
A Sprint version of the Nexus One ([[CDMA2000]]) was announced on March 17, 2010, without giving specific availability dates or pricing. The press release states a commitment to &quot;simple&quot; pricing and references the current pricing structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsreleases.sprint.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=127149&amp;p=irol-newsArticle_newsroom&amp;ID=1403426|accessdate=March 18, 2010|title=Sprint News Release: Nexus One from Google Coming to Sprint; Availability Date Announced Soon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, 2010 Sprint announced that it too, like Verizon, would not release the Nexus One, instead opting to release the more robust [[HTC EVO 4G]] in current 3G and expanding 4G markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonescoop.com/news/item.php?n=5952|accessdate=May 11, 2010|title=Sprint Bails On The Google Nexus One}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Canada===
On March 16, 2010 Google officially released the Nexus One for purchase by Canadian consumers, offering two versions of the handset that will operate on either [[Bell Canada|Bell]], [[Telus]] or [[Rogers Wireless|Rogers]]' 3G networks (UMTS band 2 and 5) or alternatively on [[Wind Mobile]] and [[Videotron]] (UMTS band 4/AWS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlenexusoneboard.blogspot.com/2010/03/nexus-one-now-compatible-with-at-3g.html|accessdate=March 16, 2010|title=Nexus One now compatible with the AT&amp;T 3G network and shipping to Canada|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, 2010, [[VidÃ©otron]] included the Nexus One as part of their launch smartphone selection for its new AWS [[HSPA+]] network.

Around Spring 2010, Google launched a Vodafone model in Europe, with plans to expand the phone to other carriers and international markets in due course.&lt;ref name=&quot;Price&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liveblog&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://technologizer.com/googlephone/|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=|newspaper=[[Technologizer]]|publisher=[[Technologizer]]|date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google is making the phone available for delivery to the [[UK]], [[Singapore]], and [[Hong Kong]], although native carrier tie-ups have not been finalized for these countries, and the phone will be shipped from the US. Customers ordering from the UK are charged $29.65 international shipping and an optional $19.00 for an extra AC adaptor, with an additional 17.5% [[European Union Value Added Tax|VAT]]. Singapore applies 7% [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]], while Hong Kong does not add any additional taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;googleinternational&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/phone/static/en_US-customs_duties_taxes_estimates.html|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Nexus One: Estimate your customs duties and taxes|publisher=[[Google]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Nexus One will not ship outside these countries for a few months, two French websites started selling it (with a carrier plan) on February 15, 2010. Phones ordered from Google in Singapore are currently being shipped from the US at the customers expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;angryangmobuy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angryangmo.com/2010/01/06/how-to-buy-google-nexus-one-phone-singapore/|title=How To Buy A Google Nexus One Phone In Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 April 2010, the Nexus One became available for pre-order on the Vodafone UK website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.vodafone.co.uk/shop/mobile-phone/google-nexus-one?WT_ref=INT-Hmpg-Lyr2-Pym-Phns-16 Nexus One - Buy the Nexus One Mobile phone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Contracts started from Â£35 per month with the phone showing as free. This was a first for Google, as customers need not order from the google.com/phone website. Vodafone predict initial orders started arriving on 3 May 2010, and the phone also became available for order in store from 30 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/apr/26/vodafone-nexus-one-google-phone | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Vodafone to start selling Google Nexus One mobile â but prices disappoint | first=Richard | last=Wray | date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2010, Vodafone Australia announced that they would make the Nexus One available to its customers, first come first served, on the $79 cap across 24 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techworld.com.au/article/351802/vodafone_launches_google_nexus_one_android_phone |title=Vodafone launches Google's Nexus One Android phone |author=Gedda, Rodney |date=1 July 2010 |work=TechWorld, Australia |publisher=IDG Communications |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 July 2010, the Nexus One was launched in South Korea with KT as its service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.show.co.kr/index.asp?code=AHI0000&amp;jurl=http://www.show.co.kr/sbrand2/nex/notice/notice_list.asp |title=[SHOW&amp;#93; ì¼ëë¬¸ì´ë¤}}&lt;/ref&gt; First 4,000 pre-orders were started to be sent to respective customers, with 100 being picked to activate it on launch event held in 10th. The Nexus One will go on sale nationwide on 17 July 2010.

Although the European, Australian and New Zealand Nexus One phones sold by Vodafone are not locked to the network of the provider, most of them are locked to a special Vodafone-specific system software, making it impossible to receive updates from Google. Vodafone UK are making 2.2 available as a FOTA update, as of the end of July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://help.vodafone.co.uk/system/selfservice.controller?CMD=BROWSE_TOPIC&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;CONFIGURATION=1058&amp;SIDE_LINK_SUB_TOPIC_ID=213651&amp;SIDE_LINK_TOPIC_ID=154737&amp;TOPIC_ID=213651&amp;TOPIC_TYPE=0&amp;STARTING_ID=0&amp;TOPIC_NAME=Android#a=2298620&amp;t=213651 Android software upgrade - Help - Vodafone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
[[Image:Nexus one screen microscope.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''PenTile matrix pixel arrangement of the AMOLED screen'']]
At time of launch, the Nexus One had a 3.7&amp;nbsp;inch [[Active-matrix OLED|AMOLED]] screen with [[PenTile]] matrix pixel arrangement.&lt;ref name=&quot;wired-comparison&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/03/iphones-lcd-screen-beats-nexus-ones-oled-display|accessdate=March 3, 2010|title=iPhone's LCD Screen Beats Nexus One's OLED Display|publisher=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nexus One AMOLED screen under the microscope&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stealthcopter.com/blog/2010/06/nexus-ones-amoled-screen-under-the-microscope|accessdate=June 11, 2010|title=Nexus One's AMOLED screen under the microscope|publisher=stealthcopter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[raster graphics|raster]] resolution is 480x800 pixels, however each pixel in the PenTile RGBG display is represented by only two subpixels on average, using [[subpixel rendering]] rather than the three found in most displays, meeting the definition of WVGA according to the Video Electronics Standards Association specifications for measuring resolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;VESA Resolution of PenTile OLED Displays&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvoyance.com/files/pdf/measuring-pentile-display-resolution-vesa-standards.pdf|accessdate=March 4, 2011|title=Application Note Measuring Display Resolution with Contrast Modulation Methodology|publisher=Nouvoyance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing supply shortages of AMOLED displays, HTC announced on July 26, 2010 that the Nexus One would begin using Super LCD display technology instead of AMOLED. The Super LCD display was described as having greater power efficiency and color accuracy than the AMOLED display, while sacrificing the lauded color saturation and deep blacks of the original display. As of January 15, 2011 or earlier, all Nexus Ones available via Brightstar, Google's worldwide distribution partner for Android development phones, shipped with Super LCD instead of AMOLED.

===Cellular===
As of March 16, 2010, there are two versions of the Nexus One.&lt;ref name=&quot;googlespecs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/phone/static/en_US-nexusone_tech_specs.html|accessdate=May 29, 2010|title=Nexus One Phone - Feature overview &amp; Technical specifications|publisher=[[Google]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both versions of the Nexus One cover most major [[GSM]] and [[3G]] providers in the US, Europe and Asia. On both phones, the GSM radio frequencies covered are 850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 1900 MHz. The original Nexus One (PB99100) also came along with [[UMTS frequency bands]] 1 (2100 MHz), 4 (1700 MHz), and 8 (900 MHz),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=John|last=Stokes|url=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/01/google-android-event-liveblog.ars|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Liveblog: Google Android Press Event|newspaper=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=Ars Technica|date=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing it to access 3G throughout Europe, as well as on [[T-Mobile USA]] and [[WIND Mobile]] and [[Mobilicity]] and [[Videotron]] in Canada. The second version of the Nexus One (PB99110) supports [[UMTS frequency bands]] 1 (2100 MHz), 2 (1900 MHz), and 5 (850 MHz), allowing it to access 3G in most of Europe, as well as on [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] in the USA and [[Rogers Wireless]], [[Fido Solutions]], [[Bell Mobility]], and [[Telus Mobility]] in Canada. The second version of the Nexus One also works on [[Telecom New Zealand]]'s [[XT Mobile Network]], [[Telcel]]'s 3G Network and [[Telstra]]'s [[Next G|Next-G]] network.

The UMTS radio supports [[High Speed Packet Access]]; [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]] at 7.2 Mbit/s, and [[High-Speed Uplink Packet Access|HSUPA]] at 2 Mbit/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialspecs&quot;/&gt;

==Software==
{{Main|Android (operating system)}}
The Nexus One was released with Android 2.1 Eclair. Later, an OTA update of Android 2.2 Froyo was released, which introduced a number of highlights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Android 2.24 Platform Highlights|author=|publisher=Google|date=|url=http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.2-highlights.html|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new Home screen, support for Adobe Flash 10.1, better Microsoft Exchange support, Wi-Fi tethering, SD-card installable applications, cloud to device messaging for two-way push sync functionality and an overall 2-5x performance improvement.

The integrated Media Gallery, developed by [[Cooliris]], provides several new features allowing the user to browse, edit, and share photos and videos on the phone.

The Nexus One ships with non-removable third-party [[foistware]] apps, including &quot;Amazon MP3&quot; and &quot;Facebook&quot;.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

As of January 28, 2011, Android-based phones have access to more than 210,000 applications through the [[Android Market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androlib.com/appstats.aspx |title=Android Market Statistics |publisher=AndroLib.com|accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nexus One OTA update to Gingerbread (2.3.3) started on 23rd February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsden.net/nexus-one-android-2-3-3-gingerbread-gr140-official-update-download-6795/ |title=Nexus One Android 2.3.3 Gingerbread Official Update |publisher=NewsDen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nexus One currently runs the Google [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.3.6 Gingerbread operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidcentral.com/nexus-one-updated-android-236-grk39f  |title=Nexus One updated to Android 2.3.6 (GRK39F) |publisher=Android Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google has stated it will not update the Nexus One to [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) saying the hardware is âtoo oldâ,&lt;ref&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/26/the-nexus-one-isnt-invited-to-the-ice-cream-sandwich-social/&lt;/ref&gt; however, third party ROMs are expected.&lt;ref&gt;http://androidandme.com/2011/10/news/nexus-one-too-old-to-be-upgraded-to-ice-cream-sandwich/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mobiputing.com/2011/10/google-wont-release-android-4-0-for-the-nexus-one-but-someone-else-probably-will/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platform development, hacking, and modification==
The Nexus One ships with an unlockable [[bootloader]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Romain Guy|date=5Jan2010|title=Nexus One for platform development|url=http://groups.google.com/group/android-platform/browse_thread/thread/2fd6d1c9963485f8/872080d49990b649|accessdate=2010-03-03}}The bootloader is unlockable out of the box, no need to crack it.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing developers to participate in the Android Open Source Project in addition to developing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com |title=Android Open Source Project |accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nexus One operating system can be unlocked and flashed with the [[fastboot]] utility which is part of the Android Open Source Project. Fastboot runs on Linux, Mac OS, or Windows and accesses the Nexus One through the [[USB]] port.

The [[bootloader]] of the Nexus One is accessed by holding the [[trackball]] while powering up the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://androidandme.com/2010/01/hacks/video-how-to-unlock-and-root-a-nexus-one/ |title=How to unlock and root a Nexus One |author=Taylor Wimberly |date=11 January 2010 |publisher=AndroidandMe.com |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Users are able to gain [[root user|root]] privileges on the device by unlocking its [[bootloader]] using the [[fastboot]] command &quot;fastboot oem unlock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hydtechblog.com/2010/01/05/getting-root-on-your-new-nexus-one-android-google-phone/ |title=Getting root on your new Nexus One Android Google Phone &amp;#124; HydTech |publisher=Hydtechblog.com |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by uploading specially crafted data packages via the Android debug bridge &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Constrabus|date=26Jun2010|title=[Tutorial] Root FRF85B/FRF83/FRF72(T-Mo/AT&amp;T) Without Unlocking (100% Confirmed)|url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=710842}}&lt;/ref&gt; without the need to unlock the bootloader. Unlocking the bootloader or rooting the device allows the user to install non-official firmware images. Additionally, obtaining root privileges enables a user to override protected operating system features, and install arbitrary software. If using the fastboot command to unlock the bootloader to gain root through use of a custom firmware image, the user is presented with a Google-created screen stating that unlocking the bootloader will void the warranty as well as void any insurance plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://android.modaco.com/content/google-nexus-one-nexusone-modaco-com/299078/how-to-unlock-the-bootloader-on-your-nexus-one/ How to unlock the bootloader on your Nexus One - Android @ MoDaCo&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The popular [[CyanogenMod]] build of [[Android (operating system)|Android]] has already been released for the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://androidcommunity.com/cyanogenmod-5-0-rom-for-nexus-one-released-20100202/ |title=CyanogenMod 5.0 ROM for Nexus One released|publisher=Android Community |date=2010-01-02 |accessdate=2001-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with other phones==
Though the [[multi-touch]] experience of the Nexus One is generally similar to that of other multi-touch enabled smartphones (iPhone, Palm Pre, etc), the Nexus One hardware uses software to &quot;enable&quot; multi-touch ability, resulting in x/y axis confusion and preventing some multi-touch applications (e.g. games) from working as they should, compared to other phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzhUzq6bTPg YouTube - Motorola Droid vs Nexus One: Multitouch Test&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of an update released February 2, 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;N1 Update&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nexus One Update Announcement|publisher= googlenexusoneboard.blogspot.com|url=http://googlenexusoneboard.blogspot.com/2010/02/new-software-update-for-nexus-one.html|date=2010-02-02|accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has pinch-to-zoom  functionality in the phone's  Browser, Gallery and Maps applications. In addition to these official  applications, 3rd party apps that support multi-touch gestures  are available.

===HTC Desire===
{{Main|HTC  Desire}}
HTC later released the HTC Desire, which has very similar specifications to the Nexus One. The Desire features an optical trackpad rather than a trackball, physical buttons rather than the touch sensitive buttons and an FM radio but lacks the noise cancelling dual microphones present in the Nexus One. The Desire is solely branded as HTC and runs [[HTC Sense]] rather than the stock version of Android. Sense can be switched off to get the stock Android experience however this was disabled on the retail HTC Desire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.androidcentral.com/htc-desire-goes-sense-less-and-turns-nexus-one AndroidCentral]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the updates have reportedly also somewhat improved 3G connectivity for the T-Mobile USA version of the device, similar issues with the AT&amp;T compatible version have not yet been addressed. A class action lawsuit is pending against Google on the matter, as the phone has problems connecting to 3G networks in areas with less than ideal coverage.

* Initially, Google did not provide telephone support and consumers were forced to use its online Android forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/186643/support_problems_good_reason_to_avoid_nexus_one.html |title=Support Problems Good Reason to Avoid Nexus One |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2010-02-07|quote=''Since its introduction last week, support forums have been busily documenting customer problems, mostly 3G service issues, which T-Mobile USA has acknowledged.

==Support==
On July 16, 2010, Google announced that the next shipment of Nexus One smartphones would be the last to be sold on their web store, stating &quot;While the global adoption of the Android platform has exceeded our expectations, the web store has not. Itâs remained a niche channel for early adopters, but itâs clear that many customers like a hands-on experience before buying a phone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/nexus-one-changes-in-availability.html |title=Nexus One changes in availability}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The device will continue to be sold through retail stores, and other channel partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/08/nexus-one-developer-phone.html Android Developers Blog: Nexus One Developer Phone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/07/19/nexus.one.discontinued/index.html?iref=NS1#fbid=nPeDbHV_wpr |title=Google quietly kills its once-hyped Nexus One phone |first=Doug |last=Gross |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 1, 2010 Google have closed the Nexus One support forums, redirecting users to the Google Mobile forum, which only has categories for software. The message shown to users was: &quot;The Nexus One forum will be archived and become read-only on November 1st. Please see the Nexus One Terms of Sale for details regarding support. If you have questions about using applications on your Nexus One post them to the Google Mobile Forum.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/android?hl=en |title=Android Help |date=October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also worthy of note is that the link to Terms of Sale on that message has no mention of support, contrary to what the message implies.

As of the announcement of Android 4.0, Ice Cream Sandwich, HTC has announced that there will be no more software updates for the Nexus One, as the hardware is now too old to run the new version of Android effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warman|first=Matt|title=Android upgrade for Google Nexus S âin weeksâ|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8848669/Android-upgrade-for-Google-Nexus-S-in-weeks.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nexus S==
{{Main|Nexus S}}
According to [[Andy Rubin]], the next Nexus series phone would have targeted business users and may have had a hardware keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60809H20100109 |title=Next version of Nexus will be enterprise phone |publisher=Reuters |date= January 9, 2010|accessdate=2010-01-18 | first=Sinead | last=Carew}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, ''The Daily Telegraph'' reported in an interview with CEO [[Eric Schmidt]] that Google would not be releasing a follow up to the Nexus One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/7864223/Googles-Eric-Schmidt-You-can-trust-us-with-your-data.html |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=2010-07-04 | location=London | title=Google's Eric Schmidt: You can trust us with your data | first=Shane | last=Richmond | date=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on November 11, 2010, Engadget leaked some pictures of a [[Samsung]] manufactured [[Nexus S]] device along with marketing materials from [[Best Buy]] and [[T-Mobile USA]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/11/11/this-is-the-nexus-s/ |title=This is the Nexus S |publisher=Engadget |date= November 11, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google officially announced the Nexus S on December 6, 2010. The device, built by Samsung, was the first to ship with Android OS version 2.3 &quot;Gingerbread&quot; and includes [[Near Field Communication]] (NFC) hardware.
