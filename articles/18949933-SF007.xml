'''PackageKit''' is an [[open source]] and free suite of [[software application]]s designed to provide a consistent and high-level [[front end]] for a number of different [[package management system]]s. PackageKit was created by Richard Hughes.

The suite is ostensibly [[cross-platform]], though it is primarily targeted at [[Linux distribution]]s which follow the interoperability standards set out by the [[freedesktop.org]] group. It uses the [[software libraries]] provided by the [[D-Bus]] and [[PolicyKit]] projects to handle [[inter-process communication]] and [[computer privilege]] negotiation.

==History==
PackageKit was created by Richard Hughes and first proposed in a series of [[blog]] posts in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Installing and Updating Software Blows Goats |url=http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/2007/07/27/installing-and-updating-software-blows-goats/ |publisher=Richard Hughes |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert Hughes' blog posts about PackageKit |url=http://blogs.gnome.org/hughsie/?s=PackageKit |publisher=Richard Hughes |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is now developed by a small team of developers. [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] 9 was the first operating system to use it as default front end for [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|yum]]. It has undergone many updates in Fedora 10 and Fedora 11.

==Design==
[[Image:Kpackagekit.png|thumb|250px|''KPackageKit'', the [[KDE]]-based front-end, integrates directly with KDE's System Settings modules. It is now called Apper as of 0.64+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polishlinux.org/kde/kpackagekit-interview/ |title=KpackageKit: future of package managers on your desktop |publisher=polishlinux.org |accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
PackageKit itself is a system activated [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]] called &lt;code&gt;packagekitd&lt;/code&gt;, that abstracts out differences between the different systems. A library called libpackagekit also allows other programs to interact with PackageKit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PackageKit Reference Manual |url=http://www.packagekit.org/gtk-doc/PkClient.html |publisher=packagekit.org |accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Features include:
* Installing local files, ServicePack media and from remote sources.
* Authorization using [[PolicyKit]].
* Does not replace existing packaging tools.
* Multi-user system aware â will not allow shutdown in critical parts of the transaction.
* A system activated daemon so exits when not in use.

===Front-ends===
There are three [[front-end]]s for PackageKit:
* '''gnome-packagekit''' to be used in the [[GNOME]] desktop.
* '''[[Apper]]''' to be used in the [[KDE]] desktop.
* '''pkcon''' to be used on the [[command line]].

===Back-ends===
A number of different [[package management system]]s (known as back-ends) support different abstract methods and signals that are used by the front-end tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently asked questions |url=http://www.packagekit.org/pk-faq.html#how-complete |publisher=packagekit.org |accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back-ends supported include:

* [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] (APT),
* [[Arch Linux]] [[Pacman (package manager)|Package Management]] ([http://www.archlinux.org/pacman/libalpm.3.html ALPM]),
* box,
* [[Conary (package manager)|Conary]],
* [[Sabayon Linux|Sabayon Linux's]] [http://wiki.sabayonlinux.org/index.php?title=En:Entropy Entropy],
