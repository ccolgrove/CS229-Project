He has previously played for [[PAOK F.C.|PAOK]] of [[Thessaloniki]].

==Career==

Shikabala, who was born in [[Aswan]], [[Egypt]], plays a free role, usually in the upper midfield, either as a [[playmaker]], a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]], or an attacking midfielder . He had a short spell in the [[Greek league]] with [[PAOK F.C.|PAOK]], however he had to return to Egypt to attend to [[Military service (Egypt)|military duties]], so he chose to regather with his previous youth club Zamalek .

Shikabala was the subject of a dispute between PAOK and Zamalek, when he had to move to his youth club Zamalek in January 2007, while still officially belonging to PAOK. [[FIFA]] ruled that the move was illegal and suspended him from domestic competition for 6 months and also fined him 990,000 euros,&lt;ref name=dom-ban1&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/17/content_7268690.htm FIFA suspends Egyptian Shikabala for six months], Xinhua News Agency&lt;/ref&gt; a decision that the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] upheld.&lt;ref name=dom-ban2&gt;[http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=17384 Shikabala Set For Comeback], Daily News Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; The ban ended on 26 October 2008&lt;ref name=ban-return1&gt;[http://www.filgoal.com/English/News.asp?NewsID=48297 FIFA shows no leniency over Shikabalaâs suspension], FilGoal.com&lt;/ref&gt; and he made his return in an under 20 game against [[Haras El Hodood]] the following day.&lt;ref name=under20&gt;[http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=17411 Shikabala Inspires Zamalek Youth], Daily News Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; He was due to make his first senior appearance on 7 November 2008 against [[Al-Mokawloon Al-Arab]]&lt;ref name=dom-ban3&gt;[http://www.mtnfootball.com/live/content.php?Item_ID=17084 Crucial League Match For Zamalek], MTN Football&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, Shikabala was included in the squad to represent Egypt in its qualification matches for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]],


At the 2nd of December 2010 Shikabala had scored his first hatrick ever with Zamalek, where all 3 goals have been scored with free kicks. He said after the match that he is living the best moments in his life with Zamalek this season where the time is first in the league and with the highest score average level since 1982 which Zamalek have it's record too.

On December 31 of 2010, he announced his retirement from international football due to racist taunts from rival fans during a league match.&lt;ref name=dom-ban4&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2010-12-31-1686152582_x.htm Shikabala ends Egypt career over racist taunts], USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;
