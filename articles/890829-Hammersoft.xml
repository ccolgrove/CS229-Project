<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="890829" ns="0" title="List of athletes on Wheaties boxes"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">[[File:SomeWheatiesBoxes.jpg|thumb|right|234px|Some Wheaties boxes with athletes or teams on the packaging, from the late 1990s.]]
In 1934, the [[breakfast cereal]] [[Wheaties]] began the practice of including pictures of [[sportsperson|athlete]]s on its packaging to coincide with its [[slogan]], &quot;The Breakfast of Champions.&quot;  In its original form, athletes were depicted on the sides or back of the cereal box, though in 1958 Wheaties began placing the pictures on the front of the box.  The tradition has included hundreds of athletes from many different sports, and also team depictions.

This article lists the athletes or teams depicted on Wheaties boxes, along with the year(s) of depiction and sport played.  This list is not all-inclusive, and athletes may have been shown together with teams and groups, or on the sides, back, or front of the box.  Some athletes appeared on the standard Wheaties box, while others appeared on the [[Honey Frosted Wheaties]] box (HFW) or that of [[Crispy Wheaties 'n' Raisins]] (CWR) and [[Wheaties Energy Crunch]] (WEC).
