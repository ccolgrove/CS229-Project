==Biography==
Lee Cronin received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] (1994) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] (1997) degrees from the [[University of York]]. From 1997 to 1999, he was a [[Leverhulme]] fellow at the [[University of Edinburgh]] working with Dr Neil Robertson, and after that he moved to the [[University of Bielefeld]] (1999â2000) as an [[Alexander_von_Humboldt_Foundation|Alexander von Humboldt]] research fellow in the laboratory of Professor [[Achim Mueller]].  In 2000 he joined the academic staff at the [[University of Birmingham]], UK, as a Lecturer in Chemistry, and in 2002 he moved to a similar position at the University of Glasgow, UK.

He became Reader at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 2005, EPSRC Advanced Fellow and Professor of Chemistry at that institution in 2006, and in 2009 became the Gardiner Professor there.

Cronin gave the opening lecture at [[TEDGlobal]] conference in 2011 in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.ted.com/talks/lee_cronin_making_matter_come_alive.html &lt;/ref&gt; He outlined initial steps his team at University of Glasgow is taking to create [[inorganic biology]], life composed of non-carbon-based material.
