{{1898 Western Conference football standings}}
The '''1898 Michigan Wolverines football team''' represented the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[1898 college football season]]. The team, with [[Gustave Ferbert]] as head coach, went 10â0 and became the first Michigan football team to win the Western Conference (now known as the [[Big Ten Conference]]) championship. The first great Michigan football team, the 1898 group outscored its opponents 205 to 26.&lt;ref name=Bentley&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan 1898 Football Team|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1898fbt.htm|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|date=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They shut out {{cfb link|year=1898|team=Michigan State Spartans|title=Michigan Agricultural College}} (39â0) and {{cfb link|year=1898|team=Notre Dame Fighting Irish|title=Notre Dame}} (23â0) before traveling to [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] for the Western Conference championship against [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]]'s {{cfb link|year=1898|team=Chicago Maroons|title=University of Chicago}} team. The Wolverines beat the favored Chicago team by a 12â11 score in a game that inspired [[Louis Elbel]] to write Michigan's fight song &quot;[[The Victors]].&quot;

==Season summary==
===October 12, 1898: Michigan 39, Michigan Agricultural 0===
[[File:The Victors (sheet music).jpg|thumb|right|155px|Louis Elbel composed Michigan's fight song &quot;[[The Victors]]&quot; ''(original sheet music pictured)'' as a tribute to the 1898 football team.]]
The 1898 season marked the first game played in the intrastate rivalry between Michigan and Michigan State (then known as Michigan Agricultural College). Michigan Agricultural had only recently commenced its football program and were no match for the 1898 Wolverines. Michigan scored 39 points and held Aggies scoreless. After the 1898 shutout, Michigan sent its freshman team against Michigan Agricultural for the next three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Grinczel |title=Michigan State Football, pp. 7-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two rivals have played each other more than 100 times since the inaugural meeting in 1898.

===October 23, 1898: Michigan 23, Notre Dame 0===
In October 1898, Michigan played Notre Dame for the first time since 1888. Michigan won the game handily on its home field in Ann Arbor by a score of 23 to 0. Michigan guard William Caley scored three touchdowns in the game, and Clifford Barabee scored Michigan's other touchdown, while [[Neil Snow]] was successful on three of four extra-point attempts.&lt;ref name=Enemies&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kryk|title=Natural enemies, pp. 27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The field in Ann Arbor was reported to be a &quot;mudbath,&quot; which favored the Wolverines who played the game in long cleats.&lt;ref name=Irish/&gt; According to the &quot;The Fighting Irish Football Encyclopedia,&quot; Michigan triple-teamed Notre Dame's 6-foot, 4-inch, 256-pound center [[John Eggeman]] and shut out the Irish.&lt;ref name=Irish&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R. Steele|title=The Fighting Irish Football Encyclopedia, p. 19|publisher=Sports &amp; Recreation|date=2003|isbn=1-58261-286-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish managed only one first-down and lost five fumbles.&lt;ref name=Enemies/&gt; Notre Dame halfback George Lins punched a Michigan player in frustration, claiming he had been held throughout the game by Michigan's quarterback. Notre Dame suspended Lins from the following week's game as punishment for the outburst.&lt;ref name=Enemies/&gt;

===October 31, 1898: Homecoming exhibition against alumni===
[[File:Allen Steckle.jpg|thumb|155px|right|[[Allen Steckle]] later gained fame as the coach of the [[Nevada Wolf Pack|University of Nevada]] football team.]]
On October 31, 1898, the Michigan football team played the school's alumni as part of the school's homecoming celebration. The Michigan varsity defeated the alumni by a score of 11 to 2. The game was considered an exhibition and did not count toward's Michigan's season record. The university's Student Athletic Association began sponsoring alumni games in 1897. For the 1898 game, the university band, glee and banjo clubs, and fraternities, participated in the event. Athletic director [[Charles A. Baird]] noted that the alumni games were organized to gain alumni support for the school's athletic teams, to allow the current athletes to benefit from the experience and knowledge of the alumni players, and to bring the alumni together &quot;so that they may renew old acquaintances and promote good fellowship, college spirit and interest in their alma mater.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alumni Events at other Universities|publisher=University of Illinois Archives|url=http://www.library.illinois.edu/archives/slc/researchguides/homecoming/otheruniversities.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 5, 1898: Michigan 6, Northwestern 5===

Michigan opened its Western Conference schedule on November 5, 1898, playing Northwestern in an away game at [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Michigan won a close game by a score of 6 to 5 as all the scoring came in the first half of play. One newspaper account of the game credited the fine work of Michigan's guards and tackles. The account gave special credit to [[Allen Steckle]] who &quot;was used a great deal in line bucking, and almost invariably made his distance.&quot;&lt;ref name=NW/&gt; Michigan's fullback William Caley had Michigan's longest run of the dayâa forty yard gain. Halfbacks Charles Widman and Clifford Barabee also ran well with the ball, and Michigan made frequent use of &quot;a mass play on tackle&quot; that proved very effective.&lt;ref name=NW/&gt; The Wolverines drove the ball to Northwestern's five-yard-line on four drives but failed to score a touchdown, having one drive halted by a holding penalty and three others stopped on downs. Northwestern's only points came on a 50-yard run by Northwestern's right tackle Bothne.&lt;ref name=NW&gt;{{cite news|title=A Close Game at Evanston: Michigan's Heavy Men Dispose of Northwestern University|publisher=Nebraska State Journal|date=1898-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 12, 1898: Michigan 12, Illinois 5===
[[File:William Cunningham (1899).jpg|thumb|right|155px|Center [[William Cunningham (American football)|William Cunningham]] became Michigan's first All-American in 1898.]]
Michigan's second conference game was a 12 to 5 win over Illinois at Detroit. The game was played after recent rains had turned the field described as &quot;a veritable sea of mud.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ill/&gt; Michigan won the game in front of a crowd of 3,500 spectators. Ater five minutes of play, &quot;the men were plastered with mud,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Illinois vs. Michigan|publisher=Dubuque Herald|date=1898-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wet field contributed to poor footing and  difficulties handling the ball.  The Wolverines won despite what one writer described as &quot;ragged play&quot; that included a number of penalties for offsides and &quot;keeping of hands.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ill/&gt; Clifford Barabee scored Michigan's first touchdown as he was shoved into the endzone by his teammates. Illinois' only score came in the first half after Michigan's fullback, [[Alanson Weeks]], fumbled, and Illinois player picked it up and ran 50 yards for a touchdown. Michigan completed the scoring in the second half with a touchdown drive that included runs of 10 and 15 yards by [[John McLean]] and additional gains by [[Neil Snow]], Charles Widman and Allen Steckle. Widman scored the touchdown on an end run. Right end [[John W. F. Bennett|John Bennett]] successfully completed both of his point after touchdown kicks for the Wolverines.&lt;ref name=Ill&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Defeats Illinois: Grounds at Detroit a Sea of Mud, But a Good Crowd Out|publisher=Nebraska State Journal|date=1898-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildup to the Chicago game===

With Michigan's victory over Illinois and the University of Chicago's victory over Wisconsin, the Thanksgiving Day match between the Wolverines and Maroons would determine the Champions of the West. A Wisconsin newspaper noted that the Chicago-Michigan game had &quot;an importance not applied to any previous game between these old rivals. It will truly be a championship game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football in the West|publisher=Daily Gazette (Janesville, WI)|date=1898-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to accommodate the big crowd of Michigan fans traveling to Chicago for the game, the Michigan Central railroad arranged for two special trains to run from Ann Arbor to Chicago at a round trip rate of five dollars.  The special excursion tickets allowed fans to spend the weekend in Chicago and return on Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Additional Local|publisher=Daily Chronicle (Marshall, MI)|date=1898-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 24, 1898: Michigan 12, Chicago 11===

The championship game was played in Chicago under ideal conditions. A crowd of 12,000 spectators was present, and ''The New York Times'' wrote, &quot;The day and the grounds were ideal for football. The thermometer was lingering around the freezing mark, but the sky was cloudless, and the northwest wind was too light to interfere with the placing of punts.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan 12; Chicago 11|publisher=The New York Times|date=1898-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago team was favored and was reported to be &quot;the heaviest that ever represented a college, the average weight of the men being over 190 pounds.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Newspaper accounts noted the Michigan line, which had given up big gains to a much lighter Northwestern team, was &quot;simply impregnable&quot; against Chicago.&lt;ref name=Chi&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Wins: Wrests Western Gridiron Championship From Chicago|publisher=The Lincoln Evening News|date=1898-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan's first score came after a holding penalty resulted in Michigan taking over possession on Chicago's five-yard-line. On the next play, Widman was shoved over the goal line for a touchdown, and Caley kicked the extra point to give Michigan a 6 to 0 lead.&lt;ref name=Chi/&gt; Later in the half, Chicago drove the ball to Michigan's 30-yard-line, and the Maroons' famed All-American [[Clarence Herschberger]] kicked the ball squarely between the posts on a placement kick to cut Michigan's lead to 6 to 5. (Field goals were counted as five points.) Early in the second half, Michigan drove the ball 50 yards for its second touchdown.&lt;ref name=Chi/&gt; With the extra point, Michigan extended its lead to 12 to 5.  Some newspaper accounts indicated that Widman ran the ball 65 yards for a touchdown on a &quot;delayed pass&quot; in the most exciting play of the game.&lt;ref name=Minn&gt;{{cite news|title=Hers The Trophy: Proud Michigan Qualifies as the Champion of the West|publisher=The Minneapolis Journal|date=1898-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago responded with a touchdown run by its big left guard, Burnett, and the extra point reduced Michigan's lead to a single point.&lt;ref name=Chi/&gt; Michigan forced Chicago to punt on its final possession, and the Wolverines became champions of the Western Conference for the first time in the school's history.  

One newspaper noted: &quot;Michigan, with the exception of one or two double passes, relied almost altogether on straight football, line bucking and runs around the end. Chicago, on the contrary, used trick plays throughout but the team work was of a high order, as shown by both teams.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Football Fields: Western Championship Carried Away From Chicago By Michigan Boys|publisher=The Galveston Daily News|date=1898-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The University celebrates its first Western Conference championship===

[[File:John McLean (Michigan).jpg|thumb|155px|right|[[John McLean (American football)|John McClean]] also set records for Michigan's track team in the 120-yard hurdles and broad jump.]]
For the first time in its history, the Michigan football team was recognized as the Champions of the West. A Minnesota newspaper wrote that for the first time a champion could be declared without any dispute:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For the first time since there has been a western championship it is possible to award it without a dispute. It must go to Michigan and after a game which was as hard fought as any ever witnessed in Chicago, Michigan won with a narrow margin but her work was all of the kind that enthuses the spectators -- good hard straight football with a plentiful sprinkling of end runs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Minn/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On the Monday evening following the victory in Chicago, Michigan's championship football team was welcomed back to Ann Arbor with a &quot;rousing celebration.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cheer&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheers for Michigan's Team|publisher=Daily Gazette (Janesville, WI)|date=1898-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 2,000 students gathered around a huge bonfire, singing and cheering &quot;until nearly midnight.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cheer/&gt; It was reported that the Michigan students turned out with more enthusiasm than had been shown in Ann Arbor since the 1895 football team returned from a game against Harvard.&lt;ref name=Cheer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The 1895 football team lost to Harvard, but the close score, 4 to 0, was viewed as proof that Michigan could play with the eastern powers that dominated college football in its early years.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michigan's first All-Americans===

Michigan's first Western Conference championship attracted the attention of the eastern football experts who selected the All-American teams. Based on the performance of Michigan's center, William Cunningham, in the Chicago game, Chicago coach Amos Alonzo Stagg recommended Cunningham as an All-American.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; [[Caspar Whitney]], who originated the practice of selecting All-American teams in 1889, chose Cunningham for his first-team All-American eleven.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; Cunningham was the first Michigan football player to be so honored.&lt;ref name=Bentley/&gt; His selection also &quot;broke the unwritten tradition that All-Americans had to come from Yale, Harvard, Princeton or a few other Eastern schools.&quot;&lt;ref name=Eastern&gt;{{cite news|title=49 Michigan Aces Make All-American|publisher=Mansfield, Ohio News Journal|date=1964-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least four other members of the 1898 team would receive All-American honors. They were:
* [[Neil Snow]], selected as a consensus All-American in 1901 after playing for the &quot;point-a-minute&quot; team that finished  11-0, did not allow a single point to be scored by an opposing team, and outscored its opponents 550-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1901 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1901fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snow also went on to score five touchdowns in the [[1902 Rose Bowl|first Rose Bowl game]].
* [[Allen Steckle]], selected a second-team All-American by [[Walter Camp]] in 1898. Steckle became a hero throughout the State of Nevada when he coached the 1903 Nevada Sagebrush football team, drawn from a student body of 80 students, to a victory over the Pacific Coast's powerful [[California Golden Bears football|University of California football team]].
* [[John McLean (American football)|John McLean]], selected as a first-team All-American in 1899 by the ''Philadelphia Inquirer''. McLean was also a star who  set the University of Michigan record in the [[110 metre hurdles|120-yard hurdles]] and the western intercollegiate record in the [[long jump|running broad jump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Records Broken|publisher=The Ironwood Times|date=1899-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  McLean later became the football coach at the [[University of Missouri]]. He was fired in 1906 after paying a player to play [[college football]] in what was called it &quot;the biggest scandal in the history of Missouri athletics.&quot;
* [[Richard France]], selected as a first-team All-American in 1899 by the ''Philadelphia Inquirer.'' In the 1899 Western Conference championship game, France's rough hits on [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]] star [[Pat O'Dea]] prompted O'Dea to slug France, leading to O'Dea's ejection from the game.

===Inspiration for &quot;The Victors&quot;===

Michigan's 12-11 victory over Chicago in 1898 also served as the inspiration for [[Louis Elbel]] to write [[The Victors]], Michigan's fight song.&lt;ref name=Bentley&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Football All-American, William Cunningham, Center, 1898|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fballam/aacunham.htm|publisher=The Regents of the University of Michigan|date=2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://alumni.umich.edu/info/um/victors.php&lt;/ref&gt;  Elbel's lyric, &quot;Champions of the West,&quot; refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship for the first time in the school's history.

By 1897, the finances of the Michigan Athletic Association under constantly changing student control were &quot;at a low ebb.&quot;&lt;ref name=Paw&gt;{{cite news|title=Will Become Manager: Michigan Athlete Gets an Unprecedented Offer|publisher=Ft. Wayne News|date=1903-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, the Association asked [[Charles A. Baird]], formerly a student manager of the football team, to return to Ann Arbor as the &quot;graduate manager&quot;&lt;ref name=Three&gt;{{cite news|title=Michiganâs âBig Three,â Yost, Baird, Fitzpatrick|publisher=The Newark Daily Advocate|date=1903-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;superintendent&quot;&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite news|title=College Comment Harvard's Official Organ Makes a Boasting Explanation That Is Rather Wishy-Washy|publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer|date=1899-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; of athletics. Baird was given &quot;complete control of all branches of athletics at Michigan&quot; in order to induce him to return to the school.&lt;ref name=Paw/&gt; One of Baird's first moves was to persuade trainer [[Keene Fitzpatrick]] to rejoin him at the school. Fitzpatrick had been the trainer of the 1894 and 1895 teams with Baird, but spent the 1896 and 1897 seasons as the trainer for Yale's football team.&lt;ref name=Three/&gt;  Baird and Fitzpatrick are credited with much of the success of the 1898 football team.

[[Gustave Ferbert]], who had played on the 1893&amp;ndash;1895 teams managed by Baird stayed on as coach in 1898. Ferbert quit his job as Michigan's football coach after the 1899 season, moving to Alaska to participate in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon Gold Rush]]. Ferbert returned from Alaska several years later as a millionaire.
 
Assistant coaches on the 1898 football team were [[James Baird (civil engineer)|James Baird]], John R. Duffy, Forrest M. Hall, [[Frederick W. Henninger]], [[William C. Malley]], and Giovanni R. Villa. The team managers were Harry B. Potter&lt;ref&gt;Harry Barent Potter later became a lawyer in [[Saginaw, Michigan]], and later on Wall Street in New York.
