{{nihongo|'''''Digimon Adventure 02'''''|ãã¸ã¢ã³ã¢ããã³ãã£ã¼ 02|Dejimon AdobenchÄ Zero TsÅ«}}, also commonly referred as '''''Digimon Zero Two''''', is the direct sequel to the [[Digimon Adventure|previous series]] and takes place three years after the original series. With most of the original characters now in junior high school, the Digital World was supposedly secure and peaceful. However, a new evil has appeared in the form of the Digimon Emperor (Digimon Kaiser). This new villain is different - he's a human just like the DigiDestined.  The Digimon Emperor has been enslaving all Digimon in sight with Black Rings and Control Spires and, to make things worse, has somehow made regular Digivolution impossible. Three new children are chosen to save the Digital World and, along with T.K. and Kari, make up the new generation of DigiDestined.

==Plot==
:''Arc 1 (episodes 1-21)''
Taking place a few years after ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'', the Digital World comes under attack by a mysterious human calling himself the Digimon Emperor who is enslaving Digimon with his black rings while building Control Spires that negate Digivolution. To fight him, T.K and Kari, along with three new children, gain a type of [[Digivice]] called a  ''[[Digivice#D-3 Digivice|D3]]'', which allows them to open a gate to be transported to the Digital World through any computer and a D-Terminal that holds Crest-themed relics called {{nihongo|Digi-Eggs||DigiMentals}} that allow Patamon and Gatomon, along with the new Digimon Veemon, Hawkmon, and Armadillomon to Armor Digivolve as a counter to the presence of Control Spires. They eventually stop the Digimon Emperor, revealed to be the boy genius [[Ken Ichijouji]], thanks to the sacrifice of [[Wormmon]], Ken's partner.

:''Arc 2 (episodes 22-37)''
With the Digimon Emperor defeated, the DigiDestined proceed to help the resident Digimon rebuild their homes. However, after his defeat, and soul searching, Ken learns of a mysterious woman who can turn Control Spires into constructs resembling living Digimon. Though Veemon, Hawkmon, and Armadillomon were able to Digivolve naturally, the Control Spire Digimon prove to be stronger until Ken joins the gang and they learn of DNA Digivolution, enabling their Digimon to fuse with each other in pairs for more power. However, the mysterious woman, revealed to be a human-Digimon hybrid called Arukenimon, responds by creating BlackWarGreymon. Though the construct refuses to follow her orders, Arukenimon and her lackey Mummymon take advantage of his drive to destroy the Destiny Stones that keep the dimensional barriers of the human and Digital Worlds from blending.

:''Arc 3 (episodes 38-50)''
Eventually, when the battle was brought to the Real World, Arukenimon and Mummymon's boss, Yukio Oikawa, makes himself known. Despite interference from Daemon and his forces, Oikawa extracts from Ken data of the Dark Spore, the object responsible for Ken becoming the Digimon Emperor, and copies it into a group of children who wish for the greatness the old, evil Ken had. Those spores develop into flowers that harvest the infected children's energy. Eventually, the DigiDestined confront Oikawa, only to learn he is a loner whose only friend in the world was the late Hiroki Hida, Cody's father, and that his actions were so he can enter the DigiWorld. 

However, it was then revealed as Oikawa attempted to make his way into the Digital World that he was only a pawn/vessel for the true mastermind, [[Myotismon]] from the first series, now reborn as [[MaloMyotismon]]. Eventually, after a long battle with aid from the DigiDestined from all over the world, the Japanese DigiDestined destroyed MaloMyotismon. Though weakened from the evil Digimon's possession, a dying Oikawa sacrifices his physical existence to return the Digital World to its peaceful state and serve as it guardian. In the series aftermath, twenty-five years later, the humans and Digimon live side by side as the Japanese DigiDestined gather together with their families.

Ougon no Digimentaru}} is the third [[Digimon]] film. It was released in Japan on July 8, 2000 as part of the 2000 Summer Toei Anime Fair along with ''[[Ojamajo Doremi|Ojamajo Doremi # the Movie]]'', which was screened between the two parts. It was released in the United States on October 6, 2000 as the third part of ''[[Digimon: The Movie]]''. This film was the longest movie Toei Animation has created in Japan. The running time was about 65 mins (the rest of the movies were between 20-40 mins).

The story focuses on American DigiDestined [[Willis (Digimon)|Willis]], whose involvement with an enigmatic threat has started to influence the rest of the DigiDestined as well. As a child, Willis was given two twin Digimon, a [[Gummymon]] and a [[Kokomon]].  One day, Kokomon mysteriously disappeared without a trace, returning later as the ruthless [[Wendigomon]] after being corrupted by a rogue viral program. Hoping to find Willis, Wendigomon begins to kidnap the other DigiDestined and de-age them. During this time, T.K. and Kari investigate Willis' whereabouts shortly after Mimi's disappearance and enlists the help of Davis and the other younger DigiDestined to help. On the way, Davis and the others run into Willis, who is traveling to his summer home in Colorado, where he believes Wendigomon wants him to go, as it was the place where Kokomon disappeared.

Willis at first refuses the help of the DigiDestined and even his own partner, [[Terriermon]], fearing they will get hurt. However, Davis and Terriermon convince him that he is not alone in this battle. When Willis meets with Wendigomon at Summer Memory the next morning, he realized Wendigomon is no longer the Digimon he knows, and prepares to fight him. In response, Wendigomon digivolves to Antylamon, and then Cherubimon, de-aging Willis and the younger DigiDestined as well. Willis figures out that his Digimon's urge for things to go back to the way there were literally meant to make Willis a kid again. In this battle, Kari and T.K. gave Willis and Davis the Golden Digi-Eggs, transforming Veemon into [[Magnamon]] and [[Terriermon]] into a Armor evolved [[Rapidmon]]. After the battle was over, Cherubimon was defeated and the older Chosen Children reappeared at the points were they had disappeared from. In the end, Willis discovered that his Digimon is still alive after the fight, ready to be reborn from a Digi-Egg.

''The North American compilation of this, and the two previous movies, claims that Willis 'created' Diaboromon, in an attempt to create a continuous storyline.  ''The compilation also cuts the de-aging of the older children and battles from the third movie in order to shorten the film. Also for the dubbed version of the third movie, all the images that were shown of the older Chosen Children at the beginning of the dubbed film were actually what they were doing when they disappeared.''

====Digimon: The Movie====
''[[Digimon: The Movie]]'', released in the U.S. and Canada territory by Fox Kids on October 6, 2000, consists of the union of the first three Japanese movies (first two parts from [[Digimon Adventure]], the third part from Digimon Adventure 02). Those stories are based in the universe introduced in the first two series of the TV series.

====Diaboromon Strikes Back====
'''''Digimon Adventure 02: Revenge of Diaboromon''''' originally released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Digimon Adventure 02: Diaboromon Strikes Back'''''|ãã¸ã¢ã³ã¢ããã³ãã£ã¼02: ãã£ã¢ãã­ã¢ã³ã®éè¥² |Dejimon AdobenchÄ Zero TsÅ«: Diablomon no Gyakushuu}} is the fourth [[Digimon]] film. It was released in Japan on March 3, 2001. It was released in the United States on August 5, 2005.

Also known as ''Revenge of Diaboromon''. In this movie, that takes place three months after MaloMyotismon's defeat, the DigiDestined go up against [[Diaboromon]] again. Tai and Matt head back to the Internet to deal with him with Omnimon, while the younger Chosen Children go to deal with the rampage of a swarm of [[Kuramon]] (Diaboromon's Fresh form). With the help of [[Angemon]] and [[Angewomon]] (with T.K. and Kari), Omnimon was able to destroy Diaboromon again, but it turned out to be a trap, as his destruction allowed many more Kuramon to go to the Real World. Things go out of control when the Kuramon in the Real 
World merge to create a Mega level called [[Armageddemon]], an alternate Mega in Diaboromon's evolutionary line. It is so powerful that neither [[Omnimon]] nor [[Imperialdramon]] were able to defeat it on their own. In the end, Omnimon gives his energy to [[Imperialdramon Fighter Mode]], powering him up to [[Imperialdramon Paladin Mode|Paladin Mode]]. Using his Omni Sword attack, Imperialdramon is able to strike down Armageddemon, splitting him back up into the Kuramon. With the help of the energy from the DigiDestined Digivices and the cell phones from the other kids of Japan, the Omni Sword is powered up, allowing all of the Kuramon to be destroyed for good.

Along with ''[[List of One Piece films#Clockwork Island Adventure|One Piece: Clockwork Island Adventure]]'', the fourth Digimon film was shown as a double feature, which was called the ''TÅei Spring Anime Fair 2001''. In total, they earned 3,000,000,000 Japanese yen.

[[Pukumon]] had taken advantage of this in order to destroy the DigiDestined.  [[Ken Ichijouji|Ken]]'s [[Pucchiemon]] reasons with Boltmon, and the kids subsequently fight the mastermind, Pukumon.  [[Joe Kido|Joe]] knocks into them, and they drop and mix up their D-Terminals.  This causes them to use the wrong [[Digieggs]] and Digivolve into new Armor Digimon, who beat Pukumon.  Overall, the story serves not only to provide light humor, but marks the first time that the Digidestined are able to use their [[Digi-Eggs]] interchangeably, and transform their Digimon into new Armored Digivolutions using each other's eggs.

The title of the audio drama means &quot;The Road to Armor Evolution&quot;.

====Ishida Yamato Tegami ~Letter~====
All begins when Matt receives a tape from a girl.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalscratch.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/drama-cd-tegami-letter/ English translation of Tegami CD Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; She will undergo a high risk operation on her eyes, and she's afraid because she could become blind if the operation is not successful. Matt, who doesn't know what to do to cheer her up, receives help and advice from Gabumon, Sakurada (one of the helpers of his father) and an old man who knows the borders' sea.

Then Matt writes the song &quot;Tobira~door&quot;, to give her courage and support, and tells, that he'll be there for her, no matter what happens.

In the end, he receives another tape from her, thanking him for the support and telling, that the operation went well, and that she will soon remove the bandages, so she can one day see the sea, where he wrote the song, with him.

====Natsu e no Tobira====
Taking place in the summer of 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalscratch.wordpress.com/2009/06/27/natsu-e-no-tobira/ English translation of 3rd Digimon Adventure 02 CD Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daisuke Motomiya|Davis]] and [[DemiVeemon]] meet up with [[Mimi Tachikawa|Mimi]], [[Willis (Digimon)|Willis]], and [[Gummymon]] in [[New York City]].  However, without warning, the entire city falls under a strange winter and becomes deserted.  The kids hear a voice and see [[fireflies]] before meeting a nameless girl, whom Davis names &quot;Nat-chan&quot; from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for &quot;summer&quot;.  Nat-chan displays feelings for Davis, but the group does not know that she is really a giant clawed Digimon, who makes her transformation by using the &quot;fireflies&quot;, which are revealed to be [[computer chip|data chips]], which have corrupted her data.  Davis realises Nat-chan was lonely and just wanted a [[Chosen Children]] partner.  Unfortunately, Nat-chan dies and comes back as a [[Digitama]], but luckily, Davis and the others take it upon themselves to help find Nat-chan's true Partner.

Willis and Mimi indicate that the sudden winter was created from Davis' heart, which was unhappy after losing the district football (soccer) competition and his [[unrequited love]] for [[Kari Kamiya|Kari]].

The name of this [[audio drama]] means &quot;The Door to Summer&quot;, meaning the portal back to their own world, and recalled by Mimi from what appears to be the book ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' during the drama.

====Digimon Adventure 02 Original Story 2003nen -Haru-====
This audio drama&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalscratch.wordpress.com/2009/06/24/os-summer-2003/ English translation of 1st Digimon Adventure 02 CD Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; takes place sometime after the events in Digimon Adventure 02, but before the 25 years later epilogue.  The audio drama fills in several plot holes pertaining to the series, and also explores some of the changes that the DigiDestined and their Partners went through that helped lead to the epilogue.

In Davis' track, ''Goggles'',  Davis reflects on the goggles given to him to by Tai, what they symbolize, and what makes a good leader.

In TK's track, ''As I Type on the Keyboard'', TK has started to write about his adventures in the Digital World and expresses his feelings on some of them, as well as being a DigiDestined in general. It is later stated that [[memorandum]] TK had begun writing was delayed in publishing until he was able to write it objectively.

In Cody's track, ''A Visit to the Grave'', Cody takes Armadillomon to visit his father's grave.  They talk about the sacrifices that Oikawa and the others have made. Cody makes a promise to start trying to understand why evil tries to take over certain people, and to try to prevent it in the future.

In Yolei's track, ''I've Become a Middle-Schooler'', Yolei talks about her life in transition to becoming a middle-schooler, her attempts to form a musical band, her growing feelings for Ken, and her new obsession with [[black tea]].

In Ken's track, ''Spring Sunlight'', Ken reminisces about his brother, the mistakes of his past, and how happy and thankful he is now.

In Kari's track, ''Hikari's Introductory Course to Partners'', Kari has begun a video recording for a class teaching new DigiDestined how to behave and act as good Partners to their Digimon.  She also talks about some of her experiences with Gatomon and the Digital World.  Near the end of the track, we find out that Davis's sister Jun, both of Yolei's older sisters, as well as Joe's older brother, have all recently become DigiDestined and require assistance in the Digital World.  Kari and the others then set out to help the new ones on their adventures. It is later stated that Kari's video later turned out to be &quot;surprisingly useful.&quot;
