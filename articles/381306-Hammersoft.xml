'''Fussball Club Basel 1893''', widely known as '''FC Basel''' is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Basel]]. They are one of the most successful clubs in Swiss football, having won the [[Swiss Super League]] 14 times, the third most for any Swiss club. They were most successful in the late 1960s and 1970s, winning the title a total of seven times between 1967 and 1980. The 1980s saw hard times for Basel as they had an absence from European competition for many years and they were relegated in 1987. In the 2000s Basel returned to the top of Swiss football; winning their first title for 22 years in 2002 and another five titles in 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2011.

They have competed in [[UEFA|European competition]] every season since 1999â2000. In the 2001â02 season the club reached the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] final, losing to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], in the 2002/03 season they qualified for the Second Group Stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and in the 2005/06 season they reached the Quarter-Finals of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. They have been in the Champions League more times than any other Swiss club (a total of 4 times) and are the first and only Swiss club to have ever qualified directly for the Champions League group-stages.

{{Main|History of FC Basel}}

===The Early Years===
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}

FC Basel was started by an advertisement on the 12 November 1893 that appeared in the Basler national newspaper requesting that a football team be formed and that anyone that wished to join should meet up the next Wednesday at 8:15. So, on the 15th of November 1893, FC Basel was born in the city of [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. One of the early [[Captain (association football)|club captains]] was [[Joan Gamper]], who later founded [[FC Barcelona]] in [[La Liga|Spain]]. FC Basel did not have much of an early footballing success; it took them 40 years to win their first trophy, winning the [[Swiss Cup]] in 1933 when they defeated arch-rivals and reigning cup-holders [[Grasshopper-Club ZÃ¼rich]] 4â3, in what is now considered to be one of the best cup finals in Swiss football history. They also won the cup in 1947 when they beat [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne Sports]], who also finished runners-up the previous year, 3â0. Basel won their first [[Swiss Super League|league title]] [[1952/1953 football season in Switzerland|in 1953]], with club legend [[RenÃ© Bader]] as manager. They finished three points above [[BSC Young Boys]].

===Rise and Fall===
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Basel won their first trophy of the new decade in 1963; with [[Czechoslovakia]]n manager [[JiÅÃ­ Sobotka|Georges Sobotka]] at the helm, Basel stormed to [[Swiss Cup]] glory by overcoming [[Grasshopper-Club ZÃ¼rich]] 2â0 in the final. But, FCB (which is pronounced &quot;Eff Cee Bee&quot; in [[Swiss German]]) came to prominence in the late 1960s under the management of [[Helmut Benthaus]] and with quality players such as [[RenÃ© Hasler]], [[Ottmar Hitzfeld]] and [[Karl Odermatt]]. Benthaus' first league win as Basel manager was in [[1966/1967 football season in Switzerland|1967]], finishing a single point above [[FC ZÃ¼rich]]. A cup final victory over [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne Sports]] also came later in the season. This led to Basel qualifying to play in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], for the first time, [[European Cup 1967â68|in 1968]]. Basel were knocked out of the tournament in the First Round, however, by [[Danish 1st Division|Danish side]] [[Akademisk Boldklub]]. Basel's next league win came [[1968/1969 football season in Switzerland|in 1969]], when they once again finished just one point above the runners-up, who this time were [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne Sports]]. This meant that Basel could embark on another European adventure, but they, once again, failed to overcome the first hurdle, who were [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] of [[Scottish Premier League|Scotland]]. In the [[1969/1970 football season in Switzerland|1969/70 season]], Basel won the league by one point over [[FC Lausanne-Sport|Lausanne Sports]], once again. The [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] was a little kinder to Basel [[European Cup 1970â71|in 1970]], as they reached the Second Round, losing to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], after defeating [[Russian Premier League|Soviets]] [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] in the First Round. Basel did not retain their title [[1970/1971 football season in Switzerland|the next season]] despite finishing with the same amount of points as the winners, [[Grasshopper-Club ZÃ¼rich]], who won it on head-to-head. After a trophy-less season, Basel then won two league titles in-a-row, [[1971/1972 football season in Switzerland|in 1972]] and [[1972/1973 football season in Switzerland|'73]]. They also won the [[Swiss League Cup|League Cup]] in 1973. In Europe, Basel failed to impress, once again, [[European Cup 1972â73|in 1972]], as they were sent crashing out at the first stage by [[Hungarian National Championship I|Hungary's]] [[Ãjpest FC|Ãjpesti DÃ³zsa SC]] but in the [[European Cup 1973â74|1973/74 season]] they excelled; eliminating [[Ãrvalsdeild|Icelanders]] [[KnattspyrnufÃ©lagiÃ° Fram|Fram ReykjavÃ­k]] and [[Club Brugge K.V.|Club Brugge]] of [[Belgian First Division|Belgium]], before narrowly exiting in the Quarter-Finals to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] 5â6 on aggregate. Despite Basel's improvement on the [[UEFA|European stage]], they did not retain the league for another four years, but they did manage to lift the [[Swiss Cup]] in 1975, beating [[FC Winterthur]] 2â1 [[extra time|after extra time]]. Basel's long awaited title-win came [[1976/1977 football season in Switzerland|in 1977]] as they triumphed over [[Servette FC]] in a playoff. This meant that Basel returned to play in the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] but they were defeated in the First Round, once more, by [[FC Wacker Innsbruck]] of [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austria]], after showing so much promise on their last European outing. After the success of the 1976/77 season, Basel endured two seasons of below-par performances and mid-table finishes until glory returned in [[1979/1980 football season in Switzerland|in 1980]], as Basel won the [[Swiss Super League|Nationalliga A]] title through the playoff. However, [[head coach|manager]] [[Helmut Benthaus]] left in 1982 and in the following seasons, Basel's final league positions started to drop until their relegation into the [[Swiss Challenge League|Nationalliga B]] [[1987/1988 football season in Switzerland|in 1988]]. Several managers came and went at [[St. Jakob Stadium]] between then and when Basel finally returned to [[Swiss Super League|Nationalliga A]] [[1994/1995 football season in Switzerland|in 1994]], under [[Claude Andrey]]. Basel avoided relegation by three points in their first season back at the top-flight, but Andrey left and was replaced by [[Karl Engel]]. Engel led Basel to a fifth-place finish in [[1995/1996 football season in Switzerland|his first season in charge]] and a solid mid-table finish in [[1996/1997 football season in Switzerland|1997]], but he was sacked after a poor start to the [[1997/1998 football season in Switzerland|1997/98 campaign]], in which Basel finished second-bottom. [[JÃ¶rg Berger]] then took over, but lasted only a year in charge before [[Christian Gross]] came. Gross' appointment went hand-in-hand with the financial backing that had just been put into the club and it was not long until Basel returned to the top.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;Basel's famous 2002/03 team&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

When [[St. Jakob-Park]] was opened in 2001, success returned. In 2002 FCB won the Double ([[Swiss Super League|Swiss Championship]] and [[Swiss Cup]]) and reached the final of the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. In the following season they were the second Swiss team to ever play in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. Their first game was in the Second Qualifying Round against [[MÅ K Å½ilina]] of [[Slovakia]]. They won 4â1 on aggregate. In the next round they faced [[Scotland|Scottish]] giants [[Celtic F.C.]]. In the first leg at [[Celtic Park]] the home side won 3â1, but in the second leg at [[St. Jakob-Park]], FCB came away with a famous 2â0 victory. This meant Basel progressed on the away goals rule after a 3â3 aggregate draw. In the First Group Stage, FCB were drawn into Group B with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]]. On Matchday One, Basel defeated Spartak 2â0 at home. Then on Matchday Two, FCB travelled to [[Anfield]] where they managed to draw 1â1 against Liverpool. After a great start to the group stage, FCB were brought back down to earth when they were defeated 6â2 by Valencia at the [[Estadio Mestalla]]. They bounced back, however, and held Valencia to a 2â2 draw in the next fixture. Basel were now sitting in second place in the group but they would still need to win at least one of their last two games and hope that Liverpool would not pick up more than two points to secure that place. In Matchday Five, Liverpool lost 1â0 to Valencia and FCB won 2â0 against Spartak at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]]. Basel's place in the last 16 was all but secured, although they still had to make sure they did not lose to Liverpool in the last game of the first group stage. On the last Matchday Basel were winning 3â0 at half-time through goals from [[Julio HernÃ¡n Rossi]], [[Christian Eduardo GimÃ©nez]] and [[TimothÃ©e Atouba|ThimothÃ©e Atouba]]. The second half was a different story, though, and Liverpool fought back to draw 3â3. This was still enough for FCB to qualify for the Second Group Stage. In the last 16, Basel faced [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and [[Deportivo de La CoruÃ±a]]. They had a poor start, losing back to back games against Manchester United at home and Juventus away. FCB then faced Deportivo in a double-header, with the home side winning 1â0 in both games. Arguably two of FCB's greatest games came next as they held Manchester United to a 1â1 draw at [[Old Trafford]] and claimed a 2â1 victory over Juventus at [[St. Jakob-Park]]. Despite picking up the same number of points as second placed Juventus, Basel crashed out on goal difference. Basel finished second in the [[Swiss Super League]] that season and won the [[Swiss Cup]] after beating [[NeuchÃ¢tel Xamax]] 6â0 in the final.

After being the surprise package in [[UEFA|Europe]] in the [[UEFA Champions League 2002â03|2002/03 season]], Basel could not bring this form into the [[UEFA Cup 2003â04|UEFA Cup in 2003/04]] as they were eliminated by [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the second round after defeating [[Malatyaspor]] in the previous round.

The club did go on to achieve some success in the [[UEFA Cup 2004â05|Europe in 2004/05]], though, as they were dropped into the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] after being eliminated by [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] in the Qualification Stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]]. After they defeated [[Russia]]n side [[FC Terek Grozny]] in the First Round they faced considerabley tougher opponents [[Feyenoord|Feyenoord Rotterdam]], [[FC Schalke 04]], [[FerencvÃ¡rosi TC]] and [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] in the Group Stage. They drew 1â1 away to Schalke, were defeated 2â1 at home by Hearts, beat FerencvÃ¡ros 2â1 at [[Stadium PuskÃ¡s Ferenc]] and won 1â0 against Feyenoord at home. They finished third in the group on seven points and qualified for the Round of 32 where they were defeated 2â0 on aggregate by [[Lille OSC]]. Basel also won the [[Swiss Super League|Domestic Title]] during the 2004/05 campaign.

====2005/2006 Season====
Basel's biggest signings of the 2005/06 season were defenders [[Daniel MajstoroviÄ]] and [[KÅji Nakata]] who were brought in to replace [[Patrick MÃ¼ller]], who was set to sign for [[Olympique Lyonnais]], and the retiring [[Murat Yakin|Murat YakÄ±n]]. Forward [[Eduardo Adelino da Silva|Eduardo]] was signed after a successful loan spell but [[Argentina|Argentinian]] goalscorers [[Christian Eduardo GimÃ©nez|Christian GimÃ©nez]] and [[Julio HernÃ¡n Rossi]] left the club.

As Swiss champions, Basel entered the [[UEFA Champions League]] third qualifying round against [[FuÃball-Bundesliga|German Bundesliga]] club [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]. Basel won the first leg 2â1 at [[St. Jakob-Park|St. Jakob Park]] but lost 3â0 at the [[Weserstadion]] in the second leg, the aggregate 4â2 in Werder's favour. Basel were then dropped into the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] where they met [[NK Å iroki Brijeg]] of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the First Round. Basel sealed a 6â0 aggregate win and were drawn into Group E alongside [[RC Strasbourg]], [[A.S. Roma]], [[Red Star Belgrade]] and [[TromsÃ¸ IL|TromsÃ¸ I.L.]]. FCB lost the first group match 2â0 against Strasbourg at home but won 2â1 away to Red Star, giving themselves an opportunity to progress to the next round if they won their next game against TromsÃ¸. They did in a seven-goal thriller, winning 4â3 and securing 3rd place. The last match of the group was against [[Italy|Italian]] giants Roma at the [[Stadio Olimpico]] where the [[Serie A]] club won 3â1. In the Round of 32 FCB came up against [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] who they beat 2â1 on aggregate after a 1â1 stalemate in [[Monaco]] and a 1â0 victory for Basel in [[Switzerland]]. As Basel progressed to the last 16 they played against Strasbourg once again. FCB won the first leg 2â0 and drew 2â2 in the second leg, winning 4â2 overall. In the Quarter-Finals the club came up against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. FCB won 2â0 at home and looked certain to progress as they travelled to the [[Riverside Stadium]]. This was not the case, however, as the [[English people|Englishmen]] fought back to win the match 4â1 and the tie 4â3.

On February 26, 2006 FC Basel broke their own club record of 52 unbeaten league games in the [[St. Jakob-Park|St. Jakob Park]]. The new record is 59, but the streak ended there on the final day of the season with a last-minute goal by [[Iulian Filipescu]] of [[FC ZÃ¼rich]], knocking Basel out of contention and giving [[FC ZÃ¼rich|ZÃ¼rich]] their first national championship since 1980/81. A sixtieth straight home league match undefeated would have made Basel champions once again, but the final score was 1-2 in favour of [[FC ZÃ¼rich|ZÃ¼rich]], this resulted in riots and property damage by hooligans of both the FCB and their rival after the match (see [[2006 Basel Hooligan Incident]] for more details).

====2006/2007 Season====
Various signings involving FCB took place during the 2006/07 [[Swiss Super League]] season. The most notable of these were the replacement of local hero [[Pascal ZuberbÃ¼hler]], who departed for [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], with [[Argentina national football team|Argentine internationalist]] [[Franco Costanzo]] and the signing of [[Delron Buckley]] on loan from [[Borussia Dortmund]]. [[Zdravko KuzmanoviÄ]] left the club during the Winter break for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]].

FC Basel's European campaign started in the first qualifying stage of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] when they beat [[Kazakhstan|Kazakhi]] side [[FC Tobol]] 3â1 on aggregate. In the second round they played against [[Liechtenstein]]er team [[FC Vaduz]], narrowly progressing on the [[away goals rule]] after a 2â2 aggregate draw. They were then put up against [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonians]] [[FK RabotniÄki]]. Basel won 6â2 at [[St. Jakob-Park]] and 1â0 at the [[National Arena Philip II of Macedon|Skopje City Stadium]] to qualify for the group stages where they faced tough opposition, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] of [[England]], [[AS Nancy]] of [[France]], [[Feyenoord]] of The [[Netherlands]] and [[WisÅa KrakÃ³w]] of [[Poland]]. Basel's first game came against Feyenoord at home. They came away with a respectable 1â1 draw. Their next group match was at [[Ewood Park]] against Blackburn Rovers. Basel played reasonably well but shaky defending became their downfall. AS Nancy, at home, were their next opponents and the match ended in a 2â2 draw. Basel's last group game was against WisÅa KrakÃ³w at the [[WisÅa Stadium]]. FCB needed a win to qualify but their poor European campaign came to an end after losing 3â1 despite taking an early lead through [[Mladen PetriÄ]].

Basel won the [[Swiss Cup]] after beating [[FC Lucerne|FC Luzern]] 1â0. The winning goal came from the penalty spot through [[Daniel MajstoroviÄ]] in the 93rd minute.

FCB finished in second place in the [[Swiss Super League]], just one point behind winners [[FC ZÃ¼rich]]. This was despite the club defeating [[FC ZÃ¼rich|ZÃ¼rich]] in all three of their meetings in that league campaign.

====2007/2008 Season====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:FC Basel vs St Gallen.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eren Derdiyok]] taking the ball around [[FC St. Gallen|St. Gallen]]'s defender [[Philipp Muntwiler]]. FC Basel won the game 3-0 (30-9-07)]]  --&gt;At the beginning of the 2007/08 season FC Basel strengthened their team by signing [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss internationalists]]  [[Marco Streller]] from [[VfB Stuttgart]], [[Benjamin Huggel]] from [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and [[David Degen]] on loan from [[Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach]]. Fans' favourite [[Mladen PetriÄ]] joined [[Borussia Dortmund]] in a big-money deal and influential defender [[Boris SmiljaniÄ]] returned to his former club [[Grasshopper-Club ZÃ¼rich]]. Highly rated Switzerland Under-21 defender [[Beg Ferati]] arrived at [[St. Jakob-Park]] in January from feeder club [[FC Concordia Basel]] on a three-and-a-half year contract. He was joined by veteran striker [[Vratislav Lokvenc]] from [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and exciting midfielder [[Marko PeroviÄ (footballer born 1984)|Marko PeroviÄ]] from [[Red Star Belgrade]] who also arrived during the Winter break.

Basel were drawn against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]n minnows [[FK Sarajevo]] in the first qualifying round of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], a tie that Basel won 8â1 on aggregate. In the next round Basel faced a considerably tougher opponent in the form of [[SV Mattersburg]] of [[Austria]]. Nonetheless, Basel finished the tie off with a 4â0 away win after a 2â1 victory at [[St. Jakob-Park]]. Basel were then drawn into a 'death group' of Group D alongside [[SK Brann]], [[NK Dinamo Zagreb]], [[Hamburger SV]] and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Stade Rennais FC]], all of which were ranked within the top 3 of their own leagues at the start of the stage. Basel won their first [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] group game against [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] at home 1â0 thanks to a [[Marco Streller]] header. Their next game was away to [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] in which Basel earned a valuable away point thanks to on form goalkeeper [[Franco Costanzo]] who kept the game at 0â0 for 90 minutes. They then faced [[SK Brann|Brann]] at [[St. Jakob-Park]] where they won 1â0 through a [[Carlos Alberto Alves Garcia|Carlitos]] free-kick and were highly praised for playing attractive and flowing football. Basel then went to Germany to face [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] at the [[HSH Nordbank Arena]] where they were fortunate to escape with a 1â1 draw. The goals came courtesy of captain [[Ivan ErgiÄ]] and [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]]'s [[Ivica OliÄ]]. Basel then faced [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] in the last 32 after qualifying 2nd in the group alongside 1st placed [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] and 3rd placed [[SK Brann|Brann]]. Sporting Lisbon finished third in their group in the [[UEFA Champions League]], which is why they were dropped into the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. The first leg took place on the 13th of February in [[Lisbon]] where the first choice goalkeeper, [[Franco Costanzo]], was injured and Basel lost 2â0. The second leg did not fair any better for Basel. [[Franco Costanzo|Costanzo]] remained injured and Basel lost 3â0 on the 21st of February in [[Basel]], resulting in the knock out of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;small&gt;Basel's 2007â08 title-winning squad.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

FC Basel won the [[Swiss Cup]] for the second consecutive season after beating second-tier side [[AC Bellinzona]] 4â1 at [[St. Jakob-Park]] on Sunday 6 April 2008. [[Eren Derdiyok]] gave Basel the lead in the first half before [[AC Bellinzona|Bellinzona]] equalised through [[Christian Pouga]] in the second. [[Daniel MajstoroviÄ]] restored the lead for Basel with a header and [[Switzerland national football team|Swiss internationalists]] [[Marco Streller]] and [[Benjamin Huggel]] scored one goal each to make the final scoreline 4â1 in Basel's favour.

Basel won the [[Swiss Super League]] for the first time since 2005 on the 10 May 2008 at [[St. Jakob-Park]] after a 2â0 win over title threats [[BSC Young Boys]]. It was the last game of the season and Basel only needed a point from the match to win the Championship but if [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]] won then they would be champions, exactly the same situation as the end of the 2005/06 season, only it was between Basel and [[FC ZÃ¼rich]] then. The painful memories of losing the league on the last day of the season in 2006 seemed to spur FCB on as they took an early lead through [[Valentin Stocker]] before [[Marco Streller]] wrapped up the victory with the second.

This rounded off a highly successful season for Basel as they conquered on the domestic front, winning both the [[Swiss Super League]] and [[Swiss Cup]], and reaching the last 32 of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]].

====2008/2009 Season====
Ahead of the 2008/09 season, FCB added to their squad by signing defenders [[Behrang Safari]] from [[MalmÃ¶ FF]] and [[David Abraham (footballer)|David Abraham]] from [[GimnÃ stic de Tarragona]], and midfielders [[JÃ¼rgen Gjasula]] and [[Marcos Gelabert]] from [[FC St. Gallen]]. Fans' favourite [[Daniel MajstoroviÄ]] left the club for [[AEK Athens F.C.]] and [[KÅji Nakata]] returned to [[J. League|Japan]] with [[Kashima Antlers]], while [[Vratislav Lokvenc]] and [[David Degen]]'s loan deals were not re-newed. [[Ivan ErgiÄ]] resigned from being [[Captain (association football)|club captain]] before the start of the season, and [[Franco Costanzo]] was unveiled as the new captain a day before the season kicked off.

Basel played their opening game of the season in [[Bern]] on 18 July 2008 against [[BSC Young Boys]], which they won 2â1 with goals coming from substitutes [[Marko PeroviÄ (footballer born 1984)|Marko PeroviÄ]] and [[Benjamin Huggel]] after [[Eudi Silva de Souza|Eudis]] put the home side ahead.

Basel entered the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in the Second Qualifying Round and were drawn against [[IFK GÃ¶teborg]] of [[Allsvenskan|Sweden]]. The first leg was on July 30, 2008 at [[Ullevi]] and finished 1â1. [[Benjamin Huggel]] put Basel ahead before [[Thomas Olsson]] equalised for the home team. The second leg took place on August 6 at [[St. Jakob-Park]]; with Basel coming from behind twice to win 4â2. [[Pontus Wernbloom]] put GÃ¶teborg ahead on 19 minutes before [[Benjamin Huggel]] equalised soon after. Early in the second half [[Robin SÃ¶der]] restored GÃ¶teborg's lead. But Basel fought back, with [[Scott Chipperfield]] equalising. Then Basel got a penalty due to a supposed hands ball in the box. Replays showed that the referee had made the wrong decision. The penalty was scored, and eventually led to the victory. Basel then faced [[VitÃ³ria S.C.]] of [[Portuguese Liga|Portugal]] in the Third Qualifying Round. The first leg at [[EstÃ¡dio D. Afonso Henriques]], on August 13, ended honours even, in a 0â0 draw. The second leg took place on August 27 at [[St. Jakob-Park]] where [[Valentin Stocker]] gave Basel an early lead on 11 minutes before [[JoÃ£o Alves]] was fouled in the penalty area by [[FranÃ§ois Marque]] and [[JoÃ£o Fajardo]] dispatched the spot-kick, just four minutes later to draw VitÃ³ria level. In the second half, the away side started well but [[Eren Derdiyok]] gave FCB a 2â1 lead which they hung on to, to qualify for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stages.

FCB were drawn into Group C alongside [[FC Barcelona]], [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] and [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]]. Basel lost their opening game 2â1 at [[St. Jakob-Park]] on September 16 against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar]]. [[Fernandinho]] put the [[Ukraine|Ukrainians]] ahead on 25 minutes before [[JÃ¡dson]] doubled their lead just before half time. [[David Abraham (footballer)|David Abraham]] scored a late consolation goal for the home team. [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting Lisbon]] were the opponents on Matchday 2 (October 1) and despite defending well and causing a few scares at the other end of the park, Basel were defeated 2â0 at the [[EstÃ¡dio JosÃ© Alvalade]]. On Matchday 3 (October 22), [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] visited Basel and came away with a 5â0 win, but a fortnight later it was a different story as FCB came away with a respectable 1â1 draw at the [[Camp Nou]], with [[Eren Derdiyok]] scoring a late equaliser after [[Lionel Messi]] put ''BarÃ§a'' ahead. On November 26, Basel travelled to Ukraine, to play Shakhtar, where they were thrashed 5â0. Basel then faced Sporting at home on the final Matchday (December 9) and were defeated 1â0.

On 16 April 2009, FCB were eliminated from the [[Swiss Cup 2008â09|Swiss Cup]] in the Semi-Final after losing 3â2 on penalties to [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]. The score was 0â0 after 90 minutes and extra time.

Despite remaining in first or second position for most of the season, Basel finished in third place behind [[FC ZÃ¼rich]] and [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]]. On May 24, 2009, Basel lost 4â1 against [[Grasshopper-Club ZÃ¼rich]], meaning that they could no longer win the [[Swiss Super League]] and that FC ZÃ¼rich were crowned champions. Three days later, on May 27, FCB lost 3â0 to Young boys, therefore also surrendering the Vice-Championship. On May 27, [[Christian Gross]] was sacked from his role as FC Basel manager after ten years in the job.

====2009/2010 Season====
[[Germany|German]] [[Thorsten Fink]] was appointed as Basel's new manager on June 9, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/22333/16/7 Thorsten Fink appointed new FC Basel manager]&lt;/ref&gt; The new manager let several players go by not extending their contracts. These were [[Ronny Hodel]], [[JÃ¼rgen Gjasula]], [[Ivan ErgiÄ]] and [[Eduardo Adelino da Silva|Eduardo]]. Star striker [[Eren Derdiyok]] was also sold to [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen]], and [[Eduardo Rubio]] returned to [[C.D.S.C. Cruz Azul|Cruz Azul]] after his loan was not made permanent. A number of players were brought into the first team from the under-21 squad to replace them, however, and a number of other new players were signed; the highest profile being [[Alexander Frei]] from [[Borussia Dortmund]]. Others included [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[ÃaÄdaÅ Atan]] from [[FC Energie Cottbus|Energie Cottbus]], [[Ghana]]ian [[Samuel Inkoom]] from [[Asante Kotoko]], [[Massimo Colomba]] from rivals [[Grasshopper-Club ZÃ¼rich|Grasshopper]] and [[Brazil]]ian [[AntÃ´nio da Silva (footballer)|AntÃ´nio da Silva]] on loan from [[Karlsruher SC]].

Basel entered the [[Europa League]] in the second qualifying round and were drawn against [[Andorra]]ns [[FC Santa Coloma|Santa Colma]]. The first leg at [[St. Jakob-Park]] ended 3â0 in Basel's favour, with [[Serkan Åahin]], [[Marco Streller]] and [[Federico Almerares]] getting on the score sheet. The second leg at [[Estadi Comunal d'Aixovall]] ended in Basel emerging 4â1 victors, and 7â1 winners on aggregate. Streller (2), [[Marcos Gelabert]] and Almerares scored the goals the second time around. FCB were then drawn against [[KnattspyrnufÃ©lag ReykjavÃ­kur|KR ReykjavÃ­k]] of [[Iceland]] in the third qualifying round. The first leg took place at [[KR-vÃ¶llur]] on July 30, and ended in a 2â2 draw. Early goals from Gudmundur Benediktsson and GrÃ©tar Sigurdsson gave the home side a 2â0 lead, before [[Scott Chipperfield]] and Almerares drew Basel level. The second leg in Switzerland ended 3â1 to Basel, meaning they won 5â3 on aggregate and progressed to a two-legged play-off against [[FK Baku]] of [[Azerbaijan]]. [[Alexander Frei]] (2) and [[Xherdan Shaqiri]] scored for FCB and [[BjÃ¶rgÃ³lfur Takefusa]] scored for the Icelanders. At the [[Tofik Bakhramov Stadium]] in [[Baku]], [[Fernando Nestor PÃ©rez]] put the locals 1â0 ahead just after half time. Basel turned it around, however, and won by three goals to one when they scored three goals in six minutes, coming from Streller (2) and [[Benjamin Huggel]]. The second leg at home ended with Basel winning 5â1 on the night and 8â2 on aggregate, meaning that they qualified for the Europa League group stage. Almerares, Gelabert, Frei, Shaqiri and [[Orhan Mustafi]] all contributed with Basel's goals while [[Felipe Almeida FÃ©lix]] scored for the away side.

FCB were then drawn into Group E alongside [[A.S. Roma]] ([[Serie A|Italy]]), [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] ([[Premier League|England]]) and [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] ([[Bulgarian A Professional Football Group|Bulgaria]]). Basel started the group off with an impressive 2â0 win over Roma at home â [[Carlos Alberto Alves Garcia|Carlitos]] and [[Federico Almerares]] bagging the goals on September 17, 2009 â before narrowly losing their second match 1â0 in a tight encounter with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] at [[Craven Cottage]] on October 1. Their third match took place on October 22 and was against [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] at the [[Vasil Levski National Stadium]]. Frei bagged two goals there to send Basel home with a 2â0 win. They also won the return leg, on November 5, by 3 goals to 1. Frei again bagged two goals, with Gelabert scoring the other. [[Todor Yanchev]] scored for the visitors. After this, they lost 2â1 to Roma away, leaving their fate hinging on the final match against Fulham at home. In a close game, the English club narrowly won by three goals to two, sending Basel crashing out and finishing in third place.

In domestic affairs, Basel sweeped the board; despite a poor start to the season (at one point they sat in ninth place), FCB came back to win the title on the last day of the season against favourites [[BSC Young Boys]] at the [[Stade de Suisse]]. Young prospect [[Valentin Stocker]] and club legend [[Scott Chipperfield]] gave Basel the goals in the 2â0 win on May 16.

On May 9, FC Basel won an outstanding 6â0 victory over [[FC Lausanne-Sport]], with Stocker scoring twice, and Shaqiri, Zoua, Chipperfield and Huggel also getting onto the scoreboard. The win secured FC Basel's tenth Cup win.

==Supporters and Rivalries==
===Fans===
FC Basel is known for having a big and loyal local following. Usually when polls are made about the most passionate club football fans, FC Basel's fans usually make the top 20 if not top 10 in the world, resulting in what is by far the highest average attendance in [[Switzerland]] with around 30,000 fans &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotblau.ch/ Inoffizielles Statistik-Portal des FC Basel 1893&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; attending every home game and with the new extension being built that number is expected to rise to around 40,000. The fans have also made themselves a name in numerous international matches in recent years.

Arguably, its most famous internationally recognisable fan is tennis star [[Roger Federer]]. The current World No. 3 is a Basel native and has supported the club since his youth. In one interview Federer said if he were not as good of a tennis player as he is today, he would have without a doubt tried to play football. He went on to say that if he was successful in the beautiful game, he would have loved to play for FC Basel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/celebrityfans/228/article.aspx Roger Federer (Celebrity fans interview) â FourFourTwo.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 their supporters caused the game against [[FC Luzern]] to be stopped after they threw hundreds of tennis balls onto the pitch. This was in protest at the kick off times being moved to accommodate a tennis tournament on the TV schedule.&lt;ref&gt;http://justcantbeatthat.com/2010/fc-luzern-1-1-fc-basel/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalry===
The city of Basel and the city of [[ZÃ¼rich]] have a long-standing rivalry. Therefore, FC Basel's most traditional and fiercest rivals are [[Grasshopper-Club ZÃ¼rich]] and [[FC ZÃ¼rich]]. In the past few seasons, the rivalry between FC ZÃ¼rich and Basel and has been fueled by FC ZÃ¼rich's league championship wins, which were won very narrowly over Basel. Supporters from both sides have caused trouble in the past years. The worst incident happened in May 2006. FC Basel had won the league in the 2003/04 and 2004/05 seasons and were set to make it three in a row if they won or drew against ZÃ¼rich at home on the last day of the 2005/06 season. But if ZÃ¼rich won, they would get the title. ZÃ¼rich took the lead after a late goal from [[Iulian Filipescu]] and consequently won the match and the league. After the final whistle, players and fans from both teams started fighting on the pitch and in the stands. This incident has fueled hatred and bitterness between fans from FC ZÃ¼rich and FC Basel. There is a controversy about which rivalry is bigger, the one with [[Grasshopper-Club ZÃ¼rich|Grasshopper]] or [[FC ZÃ¼rich]]. But it usually depends on the success of these teams. Thus there is a peculiar situation in Switzerland between the three clubs that the more successful team on the football pitch at a certain time period is usually considered the bigger rival as well. For the past few years the success of both FC Basel and FC ZÃ¼rich means their rivalry is considered the most fierce.

==Youth System==
FC Basel is known throughout [[Switzerland]] for having the Best youth system in the [[Swiss Super League|Super League]]. It is often compared to the youth systems of [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] {{Who|date=June 2011}}and because of this FC Basel's youth academy is one of the Best in whole Europe. It has produced Swiss internationalists such as [[Philipp Degen]], [[Alexander Frei]] and [[Marco Streller]]. Also, in more recent times{{when|date=December 2010}}, young talents like the [[Ecuador]]ian international youngster [[Felipe Caicedo]], [[Croatia]]n [[Ivan RakitiÄ]], [[Serbia]]n [[Zdravko KuzmanoviÄ]] and the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Yann Sommer]] along with [[Eren Derdiyok]] have risen through the ranks there. Some successful players who have come through the Basel youth system are:

==Stadium==
[[Image:St-Jakob-Park-Nacht.jpg|upright|thumb|right|200px|St. Jakob-Park at night]]

FC Basel play their home games at the 37,500 capacity [[St. Jakob-Park]] which translates into [[English language|English]] as St. Jacob's Park. [[UEFA]] have awarded the stadium a 4-star rating, the highest rating that could be given to a stadium of that capacity. St. Jakob-Park was opened in 2001, holding an attendance of 33,433, originally, but the stadium was upgraded to 42,500 due to [[Switzerland]] being co-hosts of [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. After the Euro 2008 a number of seats were removed, thus creating more space between them, and the capacity is now 37,500 seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baselunited.ch/default.aspx?group=sjp&amp;code=0905 www.baselunited.ch]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium is nicknamed &quot;Joggeli&quot; by the fans and has 2 restaurants called &quot;Restaurant UNO&quot; and &quot;Hattrick's Sports Bar&quot; and a shopping centre which opened on 1 November 2001. It also has parking space for 680 cars and has its own train station. St. Jakob-Park hosted 6 games during EURO 2008, including the opening game between [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] and a semi-final between [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]]. The most interesting feature of the stadium is the translucent outer layer, which can be illuminated in different colours for impressive effects much like [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]'s [[Allianz Arena]].

Before the St. Jakob-Park stadium was built FC Basel played home games in the Landhof (in the Quarter Kleinbasel) and, following the 1954 World Cup, in the newly built [[St. Jakob Stadium]] which was on the same site as the current stadium. During the construction period of the St. Jacob-Park the FC Basel home games were played in [[Stadion SchÃ¼tzenmatte]].

==Affiliated Clubs==
* {{flagicon|Switzerland}} '''[[FC Concordia Basel]]''' â FC Basel are the parent-club of local side Concordia who currently play in the [[Swiss Challenge League|Challenge League]]. Many of Basel's youth players, such as [[Patrik Baumann]], [[Beg Ferati]] and [[Simone Grippo]], have had loan spells there. Basel have also signed a number players from Concordia, like [[Louis Crayton]] and [[Murat Yakin]]. [[Miroslav KÃ¶nig]], [[Riccardo Meili]], [[AndrÃ© Muff]] and [[Dominik Ritter]] are just a few ex-Basel players who have gone on to play for Concordia.

* {{flagicon|Liechtenstein}} '''[[FC Vaduz]]''' â FC Basel are also like a parent-club to Vaduz who are the most successful team in Liechtenstein. Basel goalkeeper [[Yann Sommer]] previously spent time on loan at Vaduz. Ex-Basel players [[Tim Grossklaus]], [[Orkan Avci]], [[Damir DÅ¾ombiÄ]] and [[Bruno Sutter]] have played for Vaduz, Reto &quot;Fussballgott&quot; Zanni is currently playing for Vaduz.

FC Basel's traditional kit is a red and blue shirt, blue shorts with gold trim and blue socks with red trim. From this comes the nickname &quot;RotBlau&quot; which is [[Swiss German]] and German for Red and Blue (literally &quot;RedBlue&quot;). Their away kit is all neon yellow with black trim. FC Basel's kits are manufactured by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and sponsored by [[Novartis]], a multinational pharmaceutical company which is based in the city of [[Basel]].

The famous &quot;Blaugrana&quot; colours of [[FC Barcelona]] are said to have originated from the &quot;Rotblau&quot; colours of FC Basel.  [[FC Barcelona]] was founded by former FC Basel captain [[Joan Gamper]]. For the 2008/09 season, Basel changed their shirt to resemble the traditional Barcelona shirt (red and blue vertical stripes). Barcelona changed theirs to one half of the shirt red, the other blue, which happens to resemble the traditional FC Basel shirt.

[[Image:FC Basel.png|thumb|right|100px|Old FC Basel logo without the star.]]
FC Basel's current logo is a shield, the left half red and the right half blue. The shield is outlined with gold and in the centre in gold letters it says FCB which stands for &quot;Fussballclub Basel&quot; or &quot;Football Club Basel&quot;. The logo is worn in the centre of the shirt opposed to on the traditional left-hand side. Like the colours of FC Basel, the logo has a striking resemblance to that of [[FC Barcelona]] in [[Spain]]. There are theories that suggest that the founder of FC Barcelona, being at one time the captain of FC Basel, reincorporated the logo of FC Basel on to that of FC Barcelona.
The resemblances seem clear, both logos seem to incorporate the shield design, as do most other clubs. But most notably is the FCB acronyms on both logos and the Red-Blue colours, outlined in gold. Also the football that lies on the left side of the FC Basel logo seems to be the exact shape, type and colour as that of the FC Barcelona Logo in the bottom centre. Because of this, many people tend to say that FC Basel was the inspiration in the process of founding FC Barcelona in Spain.
