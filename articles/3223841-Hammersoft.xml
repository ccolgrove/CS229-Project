'''Randy Gardner''' (born December 2, 1958 in [[Los Angeles, California]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[pair skater]]. With partner [[Tai Babilonia]], he was the 1979 [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Champion]] and the 1976-1980 [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships|U.S. national champion]].

==Career==
Babilonia &amp; Gardner began skating together as children, when Babilonia was eight and Gardner ten.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/printedition/la-sp-elliott20mar20,1,6401061.column Los Angeles Times, March 20, 2008: Babilonia and Gardner's Bond Survives Off the Ice]&lt;/ref&gt; Their coach was [[John Nicks]]. The pair were five-time gold medalists at the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] and won the gold medal at the 1979 [[World Figure Skating Championships]]. They were medal favorites at the 1980 [[Figure skating at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Olympics]] but were forced to withdraw due to an injury to Gardner.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;/&gt;

Gardner revealed that he is [[gay]] in a 2006 interview with ''Scene'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;/&gt;  As an adult he discovered that he was adopted after a relative divulged the family secret and he subsequently tracked down his birth mother, with whom he developed a relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;People Magazine 2008, p. 159&quot;&gt;People Magazine, May 26, 2008, Vol. 69, No. 20, p. 159: &quot;Together Forever&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He indicated that he was working on his autobiography which was to be released at the end of 2008, but there is no indication anywhere that it was ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifeskate.com/skate/2008/04/catching-up-wit.html Lifeskate.com, April 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gardner has been featured as a choreographer on the television show &quot;[[Skating with Celebrities]]&quot;.

In 2008, Babilonia and Gardner announced their retirement from professional figure skating due to a neck injury suffered by Gardner and their advancing ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;People Magazine 2008, p. 159&quot;/&gt;
