The 20-mile pledge Walk attracted over 1,000 religious organizations, as well as 1,200 corporate teams, 1,200 schools, 2,000 volunteers, and 700 friends and family groups who all came together to help feed hungry people in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://massnonprofit.org/news.php?artid=1933&amp;catid=12 Project Bread Raises $3.8M in Its Annual âWalk for Hungerâ], Massnonprofit.org.

== Heart &amp; Sole Walkers and Volunteers ==
Unlike regular Walkers, The Heart &amp; Sole Walkers must raise at least $500 to become part of the Heart &amp; Sole Circle. The group raises more than $1 million to help hungry people annually. These special Walkers are between the ages of 9 and 90. Their help is what makes it possible to raise one third of the money given to help the hungry. Special T-shirts are given to these individuals.

Volunteers at the Walk help assist Walkers. At each checkpoint, volunteers help check off mile sheets, hand out cold water, assist Walkers by helping them cross the streets safely and motivating the participants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volunteerboston.org/IND/ProjBread.shtml Project Bread (Walk For Hunger)], Volunteer Boston.
