'''LimeWire''' is a [[free software|free]] [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] (P2P) client program that runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], and other operating systems supported by the [[Java (software platform)|Java software platform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.limewire.com/download/releases | title = Downloads}}&lt;/ref&gt; LimeWire uses the [[gnutella]] network as well as the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.limewire.com/features | title = Features}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[free software]] version and a purchasable &quot;enhanced&quot; version are available. The software was developed by Lime Wire LLC, which was a subsidiary of Lime Group. BitTorrent support is provided by [[libtorrent (Rasterbar)|libtorrent]].

On October 26, 2010, US federal court judge [[Kimba Wood]] issued an injunction forcing LimeWire to prevent &quot;the searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality, and/or all functionality&quot; of its software in [[Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/oct/27/limewire-shut-down | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Josh | last=Halliday | title=LimeWire shut down by federal court | date=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gonsalves |first=Antone |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/trends/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=228000125&amp;cid=RSSfeed_IWK_News |title=LimeWire Ordered To Shut Down â File Sharing Sites |publisher=InformationWeek |date=October 27, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trial investigating the damages necessary to compensate the affected record labels is scheduled to begin in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bangeman |first=Eric |url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/10/sour-ruling-for-limewire-as-court-says-to-turn-off-p2p-functionality.ars |title=Sour ruling for LimeWire as court says to turn off P2P functionality |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the injunction, LimeWire 5.5.11 and newer have been disabled using a [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]] installed by the company. However, version 5.5.10 and all prior versions of LimeWire remain fully functional and cannot be disabled unless a user upgrades to one of the newer versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2371670,00.asp |title='Anonymous' Plans DDoS Attack on RIAA on Friday |work=[[PC Magazine]] |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=October 28, 2010 |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcmag2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2371462,00.asp |title=Lime Wire Turns Off Limewire P2P Service |work=[[PC Magazine]] |last=Hachman |first=Mark |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has been &quot;resurrected&quot; by the creators of [[LimeWire Pirate Edition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372412,00.asp Report: LimeWire 'Resurrected' by Secret Dev Team | News &amp; Opinion | PCMag.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Written in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], LimeWire is able to run on any computer with a [[Java Virtual Machine]] installed. Installers were provided for [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Microsoft's Windows]], and [[Linux]]. Support for [[Mac OS 9]] and other previous versions was dropped with the release of LimeWire 4.0.10. From version 4.8 onwards, LimeWire works as a [[UPnP]] [[Internet Gateway Device]] controller in that it can automatically set up packet-forwarding rules with UPnP-capable routers.

LimeWire offers the sharing of its library through the [[Digital Audio Access Protocol]] (DAAP). As such when LimeWire is running and configured to allow it, any files shared will be detectable and downloaded on the local network by DAAP-enabled devices (e.g., [[Zune]], [[iTunes]]). Beginning with LimeWire 4.13.9, connections can be encrypted with [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS). Following LimeWire 4.13.11, TLS became the default connection option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://wiki.limewire.org/index.php?title=Changelog | title = Changelog}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Version history==
Until October 2010, Lime Wire LLC, the New York City based developer of LimeWire, distributed two versions of the program: a basic free version, and an enhanced version, LimeWire PRO, sold for a fee of US$21.95 with 6 months of updates, or $34.95 with 1 year of updates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limewire.com/download/pro.php Lime Wire PRO].&lt;/ref&gt; The company claimed the paid version provides faster downloads and 66% better search results. This is accomplished by facilitating direct connection with up to 10 hosts of an identical searched file at any one time, whereas the free version is limited to a maximum of 8 hosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limewire.com/english/content/download.shtml Lime Wire Â» Download LimeWire&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Being [[free software]], LimeWire has spawned [[fork (software development)|forks]], including [[LionShare]], an experimental software development project at [[Penn State University]], and [[Acquisition (software)|Acquisition]], a [[Mac OS X]]-based gnutella client with a proprietary interface. Researchers at [[Cornell University]] developed a reputation management add-in called [[Credence (reputation management scheme)|Credence]] that allows users to distinguish between &quot;genuine&quot; and &quot;suspect&quot; files before downloading them. An October 12, 2005 report states that some of LimeWire's free and [[open source software]] contributors have forked the project and called it [[FrostWire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=954 &quot;FrostWire Beta Released&quot;], from [[Slyck.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; The makers of the LimeWire software have now installed a security device that can track most viruses in files.

LimeWire was the first file sharing program to support firewall-to-firewall file transfers, a feature introduced in version 4.2, which was released in November 2004. LimeWire also now includes [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] support, but is limited to 3 Torrent uploads and 3 Torrent downloads, which coexist with ordinary downloads. As of LimeWire 5.0, an instant messenger has been added which uses the XMPP Protocol, an open source communication protocol. Users can now chat and share files with individuals or a group of friends in their buddy list.

From version 5.5.1, LimeWire has added a key activation, which requires the user to enter the unique key before activation the &quot;Pro&quot; version of the software. This has stopped people from illegally downloading the &quot;Pro&quot; versions. However, there are still ways to bypass this security, for example, there are currently cracks on the internet, or people remain using LimeWire Pro 5.5.1 Beta which also includes AVG for LimeWire and is the first version to include AVG. The most recent stable version of LimeWire is 5.5.16.

Versions of LimeWire prior to 5.5.10 can still connect to the Gnutella network and users of these versions are still able to download files, even though a message is displayed concerning the injunction during the startup process of the software. LimeWire versions 5.5.11 and newer feature an auto-update feature that allowed Lime Wire LLC to disable newer versions of the LimeWire software. Older versions of LimeWire prior to version 5.5.11 however do not include the auto-update feature and are still fully functional. As a result, neither the RIAA nor Lime Wire LLC have the ability to disable older versions of LimeWire, unless the user chooses to upgrade to a newer version of LimeWire.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcmag2&quot; /&gt;

On November 10, 2010, a secret group of developers called the &quot;Secret Dev Team&quot; sought to keep the service running by releasing the &quot;LimeWire Pirate Edition&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Limewire Info&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://limewireinfo.com/limewire-brought-back-to-life-by-secret-dev-team/|title=Limewire Brought Back to Life by Secret Dev Team|date=November 21, 2010|work=Limewire Info|accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared on several torrent websites. The software is based on LimeWire 5.6 Beta, and is aimed to allow Windows versions to still work and remove the threat of spyware or adware. The exclusive features in LimeWire PRO were also unlocked, and all security features installed by Lime Wire LLC were removed.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lyle.

== Forks and alternatives ==
A number of [[Fork (software development)|fork]]s from LimeWire have appeared, with the goal of giving users more freedom, or objecting to decisions made by LimeWire LLC they disagreed with.

=== FrostWire ===
{{Main|FrostWire}}
FrostWire was started in September 2004 by members of the LimeWire [[Open source software|open source community]], after LimeWire's distributor considered adding &quot;blocking&quot; code, in response to [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] pressure and the threat of legal action, in light of the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]''. When eventually activated, the code could block its users from sharing licensed files. This code was recently changed when lawsuits had been filed against LimeWire for p2p downloading. It had blocked all their users and redirected them to FrostWire.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

=== LimeWire Pirate Edition ===
{{Main|LimeWire Pirate Edition}}
In November 2010, as a response to the legal challenges regarding LimeWire, an anonymous individual by the handle of Meta Pirate released a modified version of LimeWire Pro, which was entitled LimeWire Pirate Edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphries&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Albanesius&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372412,00.asp|title=Report: LimeWire 'Resurrected' by Secret Dev Team | News &amp; Opinion | PCMag.com|last=Albanesius|first=Chloe|date=11.09.2010|work=[[PC Magazine]]|accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came without the Ask.com toolbar, [[adware|advertising]], [[spyware]], and [[backdoor (computing)|backdoors]], as well as all dependencies on LimeWire LLC servers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/11/horde-of-piratical-monkeys-resurrects-limewire-pirate-edition.ars|title=&quot;Horde of piratical monkeys&quot; creates LimeWire: Pirate Edition|last=Anderson|first=Nate|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to allegations that a current or former member of Lime Wire LLC staff wrote and released the software, the company has stated that: &quot;[LimeWire is] not behind these efforts. LimeWire does not authorize them. LimeWire is complying with the Courtâs October 26, 2010 injunction.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphries&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/articles/news/limewire-is-back-as-limewire-pirate-edition-2010119/|title=LimeWire is back as LimeWire Pirate Edition (UPDATED) â Tech Products &amp; Geek News | Geek.com|last=Humphries|first=Matthew|date=Nov. 9, 2010 (6:00&amp;nbsp;am)|publisher=Geek.com|accessdate=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== WireShare ===
On December 11, 2010, the source to LimeWire Pirate Edition was placed on the popular source code hosting Web site, [[SourceForge]], after the website of LimeWire Pirate Edition was taken offline. Due to trademark concerns, the name of the application was changed to WireShare. The application supports [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alexandria&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://sourceforge.net/projects/alexandria/forums/forum/710/topic/4010525
| title = SourceForge.net: SourceForge.net: Topic: Need help for LimeWire continuation
| author = nmatavka; radiorecon
| work = [[SourceForge]]
| date = 12 December 2010
| accessdate = 12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear how WireShare, and thus LimeWire Pirate Edition, differ from FrostWire, also with the purpose of removing malware and backdoors.

==Criticism==
[[File:Limevirus.jpg|thumb|right|Malware revealed by searching for a nonsensical, yet comparatively plausible string of pseudo-words.]]
On February 15, 2010, LimeWire reversed its previous anti-bundling stance and announced the inclusion of an Ask.com-powered browser toolbar which must be explicitly opted-out to prevent installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.limewire.org/?p=361 Limewire Blog]{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toolbar sends web and bittorrent searches to Ask.com, and LimeWire searches to an instance of LimeWire on the user's machine.

In LimeWire versions before 5.0, users could accidentally configure the software to allow access to any file on their computer, including documents with personal information. Recent versions of LimeWire do not allow unintentional sharing of documents or applications. In 2005, the US Federal Trade Commission issued a consumer warning regarding the dangers of using [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] networks, stating that using such networks can lead to identity theft and lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/06/p2p.shtm |title=FTC Issues Report on Peer-to-Peer File Sharing |publisher=Ftc.gov |date=September 26, 2007 |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 5, 2009, a P2P industry spokesman represented Lime Wire and others at a U.S. House of Representatives legislative hearing on H.R. 1319, &quot;The Informed P2P User Act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://dcia.info/documents/testimony/5-5%20DCIA%20WrittenTestimony.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One investigation showed that of 123 randomly selected downloaded files, 37 contained [[malicious software|malware]] â about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;PC Pro Magazine, September 2008 issue, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid 2008, a [[Macintosh]] [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan]] exploiting a vulnerability involving [[Apple Remote Desktop]] was distributed via LimeWire affecting users of [[Mac OS X]] [[Mac OS X v10.4|Tiger]] and [[Mac OS X v10.5|Leopard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/134084/2008/06/securemac.html Firms discover Trojan horse targeted at Mac OS X].&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to distribute such malware and viruses has also been reduced in versions of LimeWire 5.0 and greater, with the program defaulting to not share or search for executable files.

Prior to April 2004, the free version of LimeWire was distributed with a bundled program called '''LimeShop''' (a variant of TopMoxie), which was [[spyware]]. Among other things, LimeShop monitored online purchases in order to redirect sales commissions to Lime Wire LLC. Uninstallation of LimeWire would not remove LimeShop. With the removal of all bundled software in LimeWire 3.9.4 (released on April 20, 2004), these objections were addressed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limewire.com/english/content/features_history.shtml Lime Wire Â» Features History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; LimeWire currently has a facility that allows its server to contact a running LimeWire client and gather various information.&lt;ref name=&quot;FtT&quot;&gt;[http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/golden/freedom-speech-based-approach-limiting-filesharing-part-ii-block-list A Freedom-of-Speech-based Approach To Limiting Filesharing â Part II: The Block List].&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[identity theft]] scheme involving LimeWire was discovered in Denver in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_4561804 Police: File sharing key to ID theft scheme] By Howard Pankratz. Denver Post, October 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, 2007, Gregory Thomas Kopiloff of Seattle was arrested in what the U.S. Justice Department described as its first case against someone accused of using file sharing computer programs to commit [[identity theft]]. According to federal prosecutors, Kopiloff used LimeWire to search other people's computers for inadvertently shared financial information and then used it to obtain credit cards for an online shopping spree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2007/09/07/tech-id.html U.S. arrest puts spotlight on file-sharing risk].&lt;/ref&gt;

LimeWire automatically receives a cryptographically signed file, called simpp.xml, containing an IP block list. Blocking certain IPs has become commonplace and even considered essential in P2P filesharing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Injunction ==
According to a June 2005 report in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Lime Wire LLC was considering ceasing its distribution of LimeWire because the outcome of ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.|MGM v. Grokster]]'' &quot;handed a tool to judges that they can declare [[inducement]] whenever they want to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/technology/28peer.html?pagewanted=2 | last = Zeller | first = Tom | title = Sharing Culture Likely to Pause but Not Wither |work=New York Times | accessdate = April 15, 2008 | date=June 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|Filesharing software distributor LimeWire ordered to close by court}}
On May 12, 2010, Judge [[Kimba Wood]] of the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] ruled in [[Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC]] that LimeWire and its creator, [[Mark Gorton]], had committed copyright infringement, engaged in unfair competition, and induced others to commit copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=&quot;May2010lawsuit&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/technology/13lime.html |title=Court Rules That LimeWire Infringed On Copyrights |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 13, 2010 | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;May2010lawsuit2&quot;&gt;{{Citation |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=10632737 |title=Music Biz Wins Big in LimeWire Copyright Case |work=ABC News |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 26, 2010, LimeWire was ordered to disable the &quot;searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality&quot; after losing a court battle with the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] over claims of copyright infringement. The RIAA also announced intentions to pursue legal action over the damages caused by the program in January to compensate the affected record labels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2616212420101026?pageNumber=1 |title=Court shuts down LimeWire music-sharing service |work=[[Reuters]] |first1=Yinka |last1=Adegoke |first2=Jonathan |last2=Stempel |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20020786-261.html |title=Judge slaps Lime Wire with permanent injunction |first=Greg |last=Sandoval |work=[[CNET]] |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, the RIAA's website was taken offline on October 29 via [[denial-of-service attack]]s executed by members of [[Operation Payback]] and [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story2110_RIAA_and_LimeWire_Both_Are_Offline |title=RIAA and LimeWire Both are Offline |date=October 29, 2010 |author=Thomas Mennecke |publisher=[[Slyck.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the ruling, a company spokesperson said that the company is not shutting down, but will be using its &quot;best efforts&quot; to cease distributing and supporting P2P software.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARS Technica&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/10/sour-ruling-for-limewire-as-court-says-to-turn-off-p2p-functionality.ars|title=Sour ruling for LimeWire as court says to turn off P2P functionality|date=October 27, 2010|work=[[Ars Technica]]|accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the RIAA announced their intention to sue LimeWire for $75 trillion in damages - a sum greater than the current GDP of the entire global economy. There are currently around 11,000 songs on LimeWire that have been tagged as copyright-infringed, and the RIAA estimates that each one has been downloaded thousands of times, the penalties accruing to the above sum. &lt;ref&gt;Purewal, Sarah Jacobsson. [http://www.pcworld.com/article/223431/riaa_thinks_limewire_owes_75_trillion_in_damages.html?_r=1&amp;hp &quot;RIAA Thinks LimeWire Owes $75 Trillion in Damages&quot;], ''PCWorld.com'', March 26, 2011, accessed April 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial to decide on the eventual amount of damages owed by Limewire to thirteen record labels, including [[Warner music|Warner]] and [[Sony Music]], all of which are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), started early in May and went on until on May 13, 2011, when Gorton agreed to pay the 13 record companies $105 million in an out-of-court settlement.

Mitch Bainwol, chairman of the RIAA, referred to the âresolution of the case [as] another milestone in the continuing evolution of online music to a legitimate marketplace that appropriately rewards creators.â &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/?p=42426 |title=LimeWire pays $105m illegal filesharing settlement |date=May 13th, 2011 |publisher=[[FACT (United Kingdom magazine)|FACT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
