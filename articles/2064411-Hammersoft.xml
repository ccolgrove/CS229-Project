'''''The Gold Experience''''' is the seventeenth [[studio album]] by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (his stage name at that time being the love symbol he created). It was released on September 26, 1995. The album is considered by some fans to be the ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' of the 1990s, due to the [[rock and roll]] feel, accessibility of the tracks, and Prince's own admission that the song &quot;[[Gold (Prince song)|Gold]]&quot; would be the next &quot;[[Purple Rain (song)|Purple Rain]]&quot;.

Prince wanted to release ''The Gold Experience'' under the symbolic moniker in 1994, alongside ''[[Come (album)|Come]]'', which was marketed as a &quot;Prince&quot; album of &quot;old&quot; material.  Both albums contained material from Prince's musical production called ''[[Glam Slam Ulysses]]''.  The plan was to show the superior quality of the newer material as opposed to the older &quot;Prince&quot; material. Plans were thwarted by [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], which felt the market would be over-saturated with Prince material, and withheld the album. Prince was prompted to protest by appearing in public with the word &quot;slave&quot; written on his face and stating ''The Gold Experience'''s release date would be &quot;never&quot;.

Some songs originally intended for the album, such as &quot;Interactive&quot; and &quot;[[Days of Wild]]&quot;, were removed by the time of the album's release.  It is believed that &quot;Days of Wild&quot; was nixed because Prince was never satisfied with the studio version.  By the time the album actually was released in 1995, Prince's interest in it had passed, and he was working on songs for his 3-CD opus, ''[[Emancipation (album)|Emancipation]]'', which could be partially responsible for the album's lack of commercial success.  Despite that, ''The Gold Experience'' garnered Prince his best reviews in nearly a decade.

''The Gold Experience'' produced three [[single (music)|single]]s, each with an accompanying [[music video]]: &quot;[[I Hate U]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (Prince song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Gold (Prince song)|Gold]]&quot;.  Additionally, a video for &quot;Dolphin&quot; was released prior to the release of the album. &quot;P Control&quot; was also intended to be released as a single, but was canceled because it did not receive enough airplay.  It was, however, performed at the 1995 VH1 Fashion Rocks Awards.

The song &quot;Billy Jack Bitch&quot; was speculated by many sources to have been written about a ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' gossip columnist known as &quot;CJ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/liveonline/02/source/source060702.htm |title=''The Reliable Source â Live'' Transcript |first=Lloyd |last=Grove |date={{date|June 7, 2002}} |publisher=WashingtonPost.com |accessdate={{date|2011-09-16}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rickross.com/reference/jw/jw184.html |title=From Sex God to Doorstep Bible Basher |first=Nick |last=Webster |date={{date|April 10, 2004}} |work=The Mirror |publisher=rickross.com |accessdate={{date|2011-09-16}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackvoices.com/black_entertainment/bvbuzzcanvas/_a/july-31-2006/20060724103109990001 blackvoices.com]{{Dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prince denied the song was about the columnist when CJ herself interviewed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artworkbycj.com/about_the_artist.asp |title=About the Artist |publisher=ArtworkByCJ.com |accessdate={{date|2011-09-16}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;319&quot; appears on the soundtrack of the 1995 film, ''[[Showgirls]]''.
