'''Software remastering''' (the term '''remastering''' is taken from the [[Remaster|audio production]] process) is the process of customizing a software distribution for personal or &quot;off-label&quot; usage (and often distribution, depending on the legalities involved). It is particularly associated with some [[Linux]] distributions (most Linux distributions have been started by remastering, most notably [[Slackware]] from [[SLS Linux]]; [[Yellow Dog Linux]], [[Mandriva]], and [[TurboLinux]] from [[Red Hat Linux]] and [[Linux Mint]] from [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], which itself is a remaster of [[Debian]]). The term was popularized by [[Klaus Knopper]], creator of the [[Knoppix]] [[Live CD|live distro]], which has traditionally encouraged its users to [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hack]] the distribution in this manner to suit their needs; appropriately, Knoppix itself is a remaster of [[Debian]].

Such activity has also been done to many games (under the name [[Mod (computer gaming)|modding]]), especially those designed for user expansion; some games, in fact, most notably [[Counter-Strike]], have been created in this manner and gone on to be marketed in their own right as commercial products.
