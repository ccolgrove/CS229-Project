Forbes' World's 10 Largest Shopping Malls) [[List_of_largest_buildings_in_the_world#List_of_the_world.27s_largest_shopping_malls|largest shopping mall in the world]]. It has a land area of 42 hectares and has a gross floor area of an approximate 390,193 mÂ² (4.2 million square feet)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/01/09/malls-worlds-largest-biz-cx_tvr_0109malls_slide_4.html?thisSpeed=30000 |title=The World's Largest Malls|accessdate=2009-09-20 |last=Van Riper |first=Tom |date=2008-01-18 |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 407,101 mÂ² of total area. The mall is located in [[Bay City (Metro Manila)|Bay City]], [[Pasay City]], [[Philippines]] near the SM Central Business Park, the Manila Bay and the southern end of [[EDSA|EDSA (Epifanio de los Santos Avenue)]]. The mall attracts a daily average foot traffic of about 200,000 people.

==Location and vicinity==
The Mall of Asia was constructed within a reclaimed area. It is built on 19.5 hectares of reclaimed land and has a gross floor area of 390,193 square meters. The mall is located at the southmost tip of [[Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]]. A [[roundabout]] was constructed in the front of the mall with a huge bronze globe similar to that of the [[Universal Studios Theme Parks]] and the [[Unisphere]] in [[Flushing MeadowsâCorona Park|Flushing Meadows Park]] in [[New York City]]. On November 18, 2009, the globe was turned into an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] Globe also known as '''GlobAmaze'''. The first and only full global video display in Asia with its high resolution and full display graphics made possible by the LEDâs 26,300 pieces of point lights. This cutting edge LED technology is among other things, weather-proof, has superior brightness, and a long lifetime.&lt;ref name=&quot;philstar.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--The globe was turned into an LED globe as the new attraction at the MOA. Here's the link that the globe is now an LED globe. http://onmylefthandcorner.blogspot.com/2009/11/mall-of-asia-globe-lights-attraction.html http://www.flickr.com/photos/daniele268/4160673188/ http://kalokohan.com/globamaze-at-moa/--&gt;

==Physical details==
The SM Mall of Asia mall grounds consists of four buildings interconnected by walkways; the Main Mall, the Entertainment Mall, and the North and South Carpark Buildings.

The '''Main Mall''' includes shopping and dining establishments and the food court. The '''Entertainment Mall''' is a two-story complex, majority of which is open-air, and facing the [[Manila Bay]].

The mall's 5,000 parking spaces are divided across two, six-story parking buildings conveniently designated the North and South parking buildings. The '''South Parking''' building houses the mall's official SM Department Store, while the mall's supermarket, the [[SM Hypermarket]] is located at the '''North Parking''' building. 

One of the mall's somewhat-unique features is a 20-seater [[tram]] traveling around the mall grounds to ferry shoppers around.

Concierge desks are located in the Main Mall and the Entertainment Mall.&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2006May19&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Vasquez | first =Dinna Chan | title =MALL OF ASIA: Raising the ante on shopping | work =Life &amp; Entertainment stories | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2006-05-19 | url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife01_may19_2006 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-ever branch of Taste Asia, one of the SM Supermalls' food court brands, is located right outside the mall's supermarket, the sprawling SM Hypermarket.&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2006June30&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | last =Vasquez | first =Dinna Chan | title =Shop and dine at Mall of Asia's Hypermart | work =Life &amp; Entertainment stories | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2006-06-30 | url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife01_june30_2006 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MoA 178.jpg|thumb|The Entertainment Mall]]

[[File:Moaxmas.jpg|thumb|A giant [[Christmas Tree]] standing in San Miguel by the Bay with the Entertainment Mall at the background]]
One of the mallâs main attractions is the first ever [[IMAX]] theater in the country, along with a Director's Club Theater for intimate screenings (30 [[La-Z-Boy]] seats), a Premiere Cinema, and the CenterStage Cinema which can used for live musical concerts and theatrical performances. The [[San Miguel Corporation|San Miguel]]-[[Coca-Cola]] IMAX Theatre is one of the world's biggest [[IMAX]] screens in 3D including 2D screenings.

In addition to the mall's special theaters, it also has six regular two-tiered movie theaters similar to the ones found in almost every [[SM Supermall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2006May31&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Red| first =Isah V.| title =New malls, new cineplexes | work =Life &amp; Entertainment stories| publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2006-05-31|url =http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife02_may31_2006|accessdate=2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mall features the [[Philippines]]'s first [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-sized [[ice skating rink]]. At 61 by 30 meters, the rink is described as the biggest of its kind in [[Southeast Asia]]. It can accommodate both recreational and competitive [[figure skating]], as well as [[ice hockey]]. Along with plain access and skate rentals, the rink's operators also offer training progams in both figure skating and ice hockey.&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2006Jun27&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Libarios| first =Gabby| title =For your ice only | work =Life &amp; Entertainment stories | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2006-06-27 | url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife01_june27_2006 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[ice skating]] competitions have been held at the mall's ice skating rink, the most prestigious yet having been [[Skate Asia]] 2007. It was also the first time that the Philippines had hosted any international ice skating event.&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2007Jan16&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Salumbides | first =Willie A., jr. | title =Pretty young thing on ice | work =Sports stories | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date = 2007-01-16 | url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=sports1_jan16_2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2007Jan25&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Salumbides | first =Willie A., jr. | title =Leslie wins ice skating's top award | work =Sports stories | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2007-01-25 | url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=sports2_jan25_2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mall's open-air '''Music Hall''' directly facing the sea has also held several events, contests and concerts.&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2006Dec04&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Red| first =Isah V.| title =QTV's music video block's first anniversary bash | work =Life &amp; Entertainment stories | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2006-12-04 | url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife2_dec4_2006 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mall also provides office space. [[Dell International Services]], a subsidiary of [[Dell, Inc.]] once occupied a 13,470.5-square meter area at the second floor of the north parking building of the mall. At present, [[Teleperformance]] has taken over that space.

==History==
===Construction===
The mall is the centerpiece project of SM Prime at the SM Central Business Park, where five one-story buildings serve as the company's corporate offices (the sixth building being occupied by TeleTech Holdings, Inc. as their flagship site in the country). Construction began in mid-2002 right after the completion of a contemporary medical school, dining strip and residential complex at [[Diosdado Macapagal|Macapagal Boulevard]], adjacent to the SM Central Business Park.

The SM Mall of Asiaâs design team includes [[Arquitectonica]], design Architect; Robert Carag Ong and Associates, architect of record; GHT Services, project manager, and [http://www.hcc.com.ph Hilmarc's Construction Corp.] (for the South Parking Building, Main Mall, and Entertainment Mall) and Monolith Construction Development Corp. (for the North Parking Building), general contractors.

The mall would have opened before [[Christmas Day]] of 2005 but had been delayed due to hitches in the delivery of construction materials. Frequent rains in the last quarter of 2005 also delayed the turnover of mall space to tenants. SM Prime decided to move the opening date to March 3, 2006. 

On February 27, 2006, local newspaper ''Manila Standard Today'', reported that a team of [[Pasay City]] engineers found huge cracks underneath the structure, which was causing the structure to vibrate.&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2006Feb27&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Caber | first =Michael | title =Cracks endanger Pasay's Mall of Asia | work =Metro Stories | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2006-02-27 | url =http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police03_feb27_2006 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned about the inspection, the Pasay City Engineering Department denied making any statement regarding defects in the Mall of Asia. Engineer Edwin Javaluyas, Pasay City engineering officer, in his letter to SM Prime Holdings Inc., said he never stated that the city hallâs engineering department inspected the Mall of Asia on February 23, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2006Feb28&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last =Caber | first =Michael | title =Engineer denies threat to Mall of Asia | work =Metro Stories | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2006-02-28 | url =http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police03_feb28_2006 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SM Prime however decided to move the opening to May 21 of that year. Jeffrey Lim, corporate information officer of SM Prime Holdings, emphasized that a rescheduling of the mallâs opening was made to give the company an opportunity to allow more tenants to open shops and denied that the change was due to structural defects.&lt;ref name=&quot;YN1&quot;&gt;&quot;{{cite web | last = | title =Philippines' SM Prime delays Mall of Asia opening to May | work =Yahoo!

Also known as &quot;The Largest Mall in Asia&quot; and &quot;The 4th Largest Mall in the World&quot;
On May 20, 2006, the mall was officially inaugurated by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] with a special screening of ''[[Everest (film)|Everest]]'' in the San Miguel Coca-Cola [[IMAX]] Theater. The movie was shown three days after tri-athlete [[Leo Oracion]] reached the treacherous mountainâs summit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/everest/20060603_blogcommunity.htm GMANews.tv Everest&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; SM Bay City Arena which is under construction will be the newest addition to the attractions at the mall where large events like concerts, circus, ice shows, sports and entertainment events can be held. It is located at the side of the mall church and will compete with the 50 year-old Araneta Coliseum located at [[Cubao]], [[Quezon City]].
[[SM Prime]] declares to replace every old SM Sign to a New One

===Esplanade===
An [[esplanade]] was constructed at the back of the mall where it served as the observation center for the First [[World Pyro Olympics]] in December 2005. 

The second World Pyro Olympics were held at the SM Mall of Asia's boardwalk area in early January, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;MST2007Jan16&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Veneracion | first =Connie | title =The pyro-olympics experience | work =Op-Editorial: SassyLawyer | publisher =Manila Standard Today | date =2007-01-16 | url =http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=connieVeneracion_jan16_2007 | accessdate = 2007-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Esplanade was also the venue for Lovapalooza 2, wherein more than 5,300 couples kissed for 10 seconds on February 10, 2007, breaking [[Hungary]]'s 4,445 in the [[Guinness World Records]].

Also, an events venue named One Esplanade was constructed here. One Esplanade is usually used for product launches, parties, and other events.

There is also a strip mall owned by Mr. Henry Sy and Mr. Mariano Nocom, called the San Miguel by the Bay at the Esplanade. The strip mall has retail shops and restaurants and is an extension of the retail facilities of the SM Mall of Asia. It was opened on November 2007.
