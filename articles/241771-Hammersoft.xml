'''Catherine Millet''' (born 1 April 1948 in [[Bois-Colombes]], [[Hauts-de-Seine]]) is a [[French writer]], [[art critic]], [[curator]], and founder and editor of the magazine ''[[Art Press]]'', which focuses on [[modern art]] and [[contemporary art]].

Born in [[Bois-Colombes]], [[France]], she is best known as the author of the 2002 memoir ''[[The Sexual Life of Catherine M.]]''; the book details her sexual history, from childhood [[masturbation]] to an adult fascination with [[group sex]]. The book was reviewed by [[Edmund White]] as &quot;the most explicit book about sex ever written by a woman&quot;.

In 2008 she published a sequel of sorts called ''Jour de Souffrance'', translated to English in 2009 as ''Jealousy: The Other Life of Catherine M.''

She is married to the poet and novelist [[Jacques Henric]]. [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/biography/story/0,6000,718044,00.html]
