'''Saif al-Arab Gaddafi''' ({{lang-ar|Ø³ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ Ø§ÙÙØ°Ø§ÙÙ}}, ''lit. Sword of the Arabs; of the [[Qadhadhfa|Gaddafa]]''; 1982 â 30 April 2011) was the sixth son of former Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name=worldnewsco /&gt; From around 2006 to 2010, Saif spent much of his time in [[Munich]] where he was enrolled at the [[Technical University Munich]]. On 30 April 2011, the Libyan government reported that Saif and three of his young nieces and nephews were killed by a [[NATO]] airstrike on his house during the [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan civil war]].&lt;ref name=bbc1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=aljazeera1 /&gt; During the beginning of the uprising, Saif was put in charge of military forces by his father in order to put down protesters in [[Benghazi]].&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; Saif was viewed as the most low-profile of Gaddafi's eight children.

==Early life==
Saif al-Arab was born in 1982 in the Libyan capital [[Tripoli]]. His father was Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]],&lt;ref name=un /&gt; and his mother was [[Safia Farkash]], Gaddafi's second wife.&lt;ref name=aspenclassifieds /&gt; Saif was wounded in the [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|U.S. bombing attack of 1986]], when he was four years old.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;

==Life in Munich==
In 2006 Saif al-Arab enrolled as a student at the [[Technical University of Munich]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=tampabay /&gt; In November that year, while living as a student in [[Munich]], Saif al-Arab became involved in a fight with a nightclub bouncer, after his girlfriend was thrown out of Munichâs &quot;4004&quot; nightclub for performing a [[strip show]] for Saif al-Arab.  In the resulting scuffle Saif al-Arab received a cut to his head.  Although Saif al-Arab was charged, the Munich public prosecutor dropped charges on the basis that a prosecution would not be in the public interest. German police later received reports that Saif al-Arab was planning an [[Acid throwing|acid attack]] against the bouncer and the Libyan embassy in Germany unsuccessfully attempted to secure diplomatic immunity for Saif al-Arab.  By March 2007, Saif al-Arab's location was not known and it was thought that he was not in Germany.&lt;ref name=spiegel /&gt;

In 2008, Saif al-Arab was again studying in Munich. Excessive noise from the exhaust of his [[Ferrari F430]] led to questions from the German police&lt;ref name=worldnewsco /&gt; and his car being impounded.&lt;ref name=bbc2 /&gt; Also that year Saif al-Arab was suspected of attempting to smuggle an assault rifle, a revolver and munitions from Munich to Paris in a car with diplomatic number plates. However, the case was later dropped as the alleged weapons were never found and the German public prosecutor decided that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a prosecution.&lt;ref name=tampabay /&gt; [[The Guardian]] newspaper reported that German police officers had stated that the case was dropped out of fear that German businesses and residents in Libya would suffer retaliatory action, although this was denied by the German prosecutor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/01/gaddafi-son-saif-al-arab | title=Gaddafi's son Saif al-Arab was well known to German police | work=The Guardian | date=1 May 2011 | accessdate=30 June 2011 | location=London | first=Julian | last=Borger}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to his studies, [[Al Jazeera]] reported Saif al-Arab engaged in unspecified business activities and spent much of his time partying while in Munich.&lt;ref name=aljazeera2 /&gt;  Notwithstanding these media reports, Saif was viewed as the most low-profile of Gaddafi's sons.&lt;ref name=alarabiya1 /&gt;

==Actions during the Libyan civil war==
In February 2011, following the outbreak of the [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libyan civil war]], the German press reported that Saif al-Arab had returned to Libya. Subsequently, the Bavarian Interior Ministry stated that he had been declared ''[[persona non grata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mail.com/news/world/385744-gadhafis-son-survived-us-strike-1986.html|title=Gadhafi's son had survived US strike in 1986|work=Mail.com|agency=Associated Press|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=15 October 2011|location=Cairo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stages of Libyan civil war Saif al-Arab was sent by his father to the eastern part of Libya to put down the protests.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt; Combat troops and military equipment were said to have been placed at his disposal. 

On 26 February 2011, the [[United Nations Security Council]] issued [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970|Resolution 1970]] which imposed a travel ban on Saif al-Arab but stopped short of imposing [[asset freezing]] as it did with many other members of the Gaddafi family.&lt;ref name=un /&gt;  An [[Interpol notice]] (orange notice) was then issued against him.&lt;ref name=alarabiya2 /&gt;

== Death ==
On 30 April 2011, a Libyan government spokesman, [[Moussa Ibrahim]], announced an air strike on Saif al-Arab's house had killed Saif al-Arab, along with three of Muammar Gaddafi's grandchildren. Moussa Ibrahim refused to release the names of the grandchildren killed for &quot;privacy reasons&quot;. The government also claimed Muammar Gaddafi was present in the house during the attack, but &quot;escaped&quot;.&lt;ref name=aljazeera1 /&gt;  The next day Libyan state TV showed footage of two bodies in a hospital fully covered and veiled, and thus unidentifiable, but claimed that one of them was Saif al-Arab Gaddafi's corpse.&lt;ref name=aljazeera-live /&gt;

NATO said it struck a command and control center, not a residential structure and that it was not targeting individuals.&lt;ref name=aljazeera-live /&gt; The British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] says it is unable to verify if Saif al-Arab or his relatives were killed.&lt;ref name=reuters1 /&gt;

Members of the opposition centred in [[Benghazi]] have speculated that the Libyan government's claim of Saif al-Arab's death was a tactic to gain sympathy.&lt;ref name=aljazeera-live /&gt; Abdul Hafez Goga, spokesperson for the [[National Transitional Council]], said he thinks it could all be fabrication:  &quot;Back in 1986, Gaddafi once claimed that [[Ronald Reagan]], then US president, had launched a strike on his compound in Tripoli and killed his daughter. Many journalists since then investigated and found out that the actual child that had died had nothing to do with Gaddafi, that he sort of adopted her posthumously.&quot;&lt;ref name=aljazeera1 /&gt;

NATO claimed that it has no evidence of Saif's death and could neither confirm nor deny Libyan claims. They further said what the Libyan government has called a &quot;residence&quot; actually held an underground bunker which is used as a command and control center and that was the target.&lt;ref name=brisbanetimes /&gt;

The French surgeon GÃ©rard Le Clouerec who worked at a private clinic in Libya was asked by the Libyan authorities to provide independent verification of the identity of the bodies of one adult and two children. While Le Clouerec was confident that all three had been killed as a result of blast injuries, due to the severity of the injuries he could not identify the bodies of the children.  He was able to confirm that the adult corpse was the body of a man aged about 30, with a thin moustache and beard.  Le Clouerec was shown a photograph, which he was told depicted Saif al-Arab.  The face of the man's body matched that of the photograph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/05/02/idINIndia-56693520110502 | work=Reuters | title=Libya's Gaddafi presses offensive after son killed | date=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Le Clouerec concluded that the body was &quot;most probably the son of Colonel Gaddafi.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/world/05/02/11/gaddafi-tanks-pound-rebel-city-ahead-sons-funeral&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest-ranking Roman Catholic official in Tripoli, Apostolic Vicar [[Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli]], also confirmed the death of Saif al-Arab; his body was reported to be shown to the leaders of churches in Libya.&lt;ref name=arabtimesonline /&gt;

On 25 May, [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the Italian prime minister, dismissed claims of Saif al-Arab's death as propaganda. He said that according to intelligence services, Saif al-Arab was not dead but was living in another unspecified country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berlusconi: Gaddafi's son not dead|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/world/berlusconi-gaddafis-son-not-dead-506444.html|publisher=Irish Examiner|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August, with the pro-Gaddafi forces [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|on the brink of losing Tripoli]], Saif al-Arab's brother [[Mutassim Gaddafi|Mutassim]] spoke of envying Saif as according to Mutassim, Saif had been &quot;martyred&quot; in a NATO airsrike. Mutassim had been speaking privately to his former Dutch girlfriend, [[Talitha van Zon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8726797/Mutassim-Gaddafis-girlfriend-tells-of-the-final-days-of-Libyan-regime.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nick | last=Meo | title=Mutassim Gaddafi's girlfriend tells of the final days of Libyan regime | date=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==
{{external media |align=right |width=300 |image1=[http://uk.reuters.com/article/slideshow/idUKLDE71Q0MP20110502#a=1 Reuters â Libyans attend the funeral of Saif Al-Arab Gaddafi]}}
About 2,000 of Muammar Gaddafi's supporters attended the funeral of the Libyan leader's son Saif al-Arab, his second youngest, in Tripoli on  2 May 2011, as the regime intensified its attack on the besieged city of Misrata. The elder Gaddafi himself did not attend the funeral, however, two of his other sons, [[Saif al-Islam]], who was seen as his father's intended successor, and [[Hannibal Muammar Gaddafi|Hannibal]] were both observed in the crowd.&lt;ref name=reuters2/&gt;

Saif's body, covered in a cloth of pro-Gaddafi green, was brought to the Al-Hani Cemetery in a black ambulance.

Three of Gaddafi's grandchildren, identified by the authorities as being a child each of Hannibal, Muhammad and their sister Ayesha, were also buried.
