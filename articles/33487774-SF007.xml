However there are also numerous projects aimed at providing only a certain script, such as the [[Arabeyes]] Arabic font. The advantage of targeting only some scripts with a [[font]] was that certain Unicode characters should be rendered differently depending on which language they are used in.  Unicode fonts in modern formats such as [[OpenType]] provide the same by containing multiple glyphs per character. (See also: [[Han unification]])

==GNU Unifont==
{{Main|GNU Unifont}}
'''[[GNU Unifont]]''' is a [[bitmap]]-based font created by Roman Czyborra that is  present in most free [[operating system]]s and windowing systems such as [[Linux]], [[XFree86]] or the [[X.Org Server]].  The development and maintenance of this font has been taken over by David Starner from the [[Debian]] project.  The font is released under the [[GNU General Public License]].

==Free UCS Outline Fonts==
{{Main|Free UCS Outline Fonts}}
The '''Free UCS Outline Fonts''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/freefont/ Free UCS Outline Fonts]&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''freefont''') is a font collection project. The project was started by PrimoÅ¾ Peterlin and is currently administered by Steve White.  The aim of this project has been to produce a package of fonts by collecting existing free fonts and special donations, to support as many Unicode characters as possible.  The font family is released as '''GNU FreeFont''' under the [[GNU General Public License]]. It also supports several font formats, including [[PostScript]], [[TrueType]], and [[OpenType]]. For this reason the fonts are derived from original work made in [[FontForge]], and stored in .sfd (Spline Font Database) files. The most recent release is from October 2010.

==SIL fonts==
[[SIL International]] offers a large number of  fonts, editors, translation and book production systems&lt;ref&gt;[http://scripts.sil.org/default NRSI: Computers and Writing Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their goal to bridge the [[digital divide]] to minority languages.  This site contains many utilities for Windows systems, including right-to-left editors, keymappers, RTF translators, and high-quality, free Unicode fonts.
SIL publish their fonts under their own [[SIL Open Font License]]. Typefaces include [[Charis SIL]], [[Doulos SIL]] and [[Gentium]].

==MPH 2B Damase==
Mark Williamson's MPH 2B Damase is a free font encoding many non-Latin scripts, including the Unicode 4.1 scripts in the [[Supplementary Multilingual Plane]]:
[[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], Cherokee, Coptic, [[Cypriot Syllabary]], [[Cyrillic]], Deseret, Georgian, [[Glagolitic]], Gothic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Limbu, [[Linear B]] (partial coverage), Old Italic, [[Old Persian cuneiform]], [[Osmanya]], [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Shavian]], Syloti Nagri (no conjuncts), Tai Le (no combining tone marks), Thaana, Tifinagh, Ugaritic, and Vietnamese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/views/View_MPH2BDamase.html Details for MPH 2B Damase]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IndUni fonts==
The IndUni fonts is a GPL-licensed font family with many accents and combining characters, especially suitable for Indic, Indian and Nepali, (Sanskrit, Prakrit, Hindi) and Middle Eastern languages and Urdu in transliteration.  It also includes characters for Avestan and for the Pinyin representation of Chinese, a set of Cyrillic characters and a basic set of Greek letters.  The fonts implement almost the whole of the Multilingual European Subset 1 of Unicode.  Also provided are keyboard handlers for Windows and the Mac, making input very easy.

They are based on fonts designed by URW++ Design and Development Incorporated, and offer lookalikes for [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]], [[Helvetica]], [[Times Roman|Times]], [[Palatino]], and [[New Century Schoolbook]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bombay.indology.info/software/fonts/induni/ IndUni fonts, by John Smith]&lt;/ref&gt;
