The '''Bakersfield Jam''' is an expansion franchise of the [[NBA Development League|National Basketball Association Development League]] (D-League) that began play in 2006-07. It plays its home games at the newly-built [[Jam Events Center]] in [[Bakersfield, California]], [[United States]], which had been built as their practice facility.  Previously, the Jam had played their home games at the [[Rabobank Arena]].

In 2007, there was a contest where the fans could decide on a new name for the team.  The choices were to rename the team ''Desperados'', ''Roughnecks'', ''Oilers'', or keep the name Jam.  On Thursday, May 17, the team announced that the team will remain the Bakersfield Jam, as that name won the poll in a landslide vote. After the contest, the Jam unveiled a new scheme for the logo. They replaced the blue to red. [http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3471293]

On April 29, 2009, it was reported that the Jam had ceased operations, citing lack of sufficient fan attendance. [http://www.bakersfield.com/news/sports/jam/x443328471/D-LEAVE]  However, on June 18, the Jam announced that they had not shut down and plan to play in the 2009-10 season, with further details to come the following day.
