'''Baja California'''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes informally referred to as '''Baja California Norte''' to distinguish it from both the [[Baja California peninsula]], of which it forms the northern half, and [[Baja California Sur]], the adjacent state that covers the southern half of the peninsula. While it is a well-established term for the northern half of the Baja California peninsula, however, its usage would not be correct, because ''Baja California Norte'' has never existed as a political designation for a state, territory, district or region.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-es|Ëbaxa kaliËfornja}}, {{IPA-en|ËbÉËhÉË kÃ¦lÉ¨ËfÉrnjÉ|lang}}) officially ''Estado Libre y Soberano de Baja California'' ({{lang-en|Free and Sovereign State of Lower California}}) is one of the 31 states which, with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is both the northernmost and westernmost state of Mexico. Before becoming a state in 1953, the area was known as the '''North Territory of Baja California'''. It has an area of {{convert|70113|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, or 3.57% of the land mass of Mexico and comprises the northern half of the [[Baja California peninsula]], north of the [[28th parallel north|28th parallel]]. The state is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by [[Sonora]], the [[U.S. State]] of [[Arizona]], and the [[Gulf of California]] (also known as the [[Sea of Cortez]]), and on the south by [[Baja California Sur]]. Its northern limit is the U.S. state of [[California]].

The state has a population of 2,844,469 (2005 census), and estimated 3,165,776 (June 2009)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bajacalifornia.gob.mx/conepo/seis/Publicaciones/2009/perfiSociodemBC.pdf Sociodemographic profile of BC]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; much more than the sparsely populated Baja California Sur to the south, and similar to [[San Diego County]] on its north. Over 75% of the population lives in the capital city, [[Mexicali]], or in [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]] and [[Tijuana]]. Other important cities include [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], [[Rosarito (Baja California)|Rosarito]] and [[Tecate]]. The population of the state is composed of [[Mestizos]], mostly immigrants from other parts of Mexico, and, as with most northern Mexican states, a large population of Mexicans of [[White Mexican|European]] ancestry, and also a large minority group of [[East Asian]], Middle Eastern and [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|indigenous]] descent. Additionally, there is a large immigrant population from the United States due to its proximity to [[San Diego]] and the cheaper cost of living compared to San Diego. There is also a significant population from Central America. Many immigrants moved to Baja California for a better quality of life and the number of higher paying jobs in comparison to the rest of Mexico and [[Latin America]].

Baja California is the twelfth largest state by area in Mexico. Its geography ranges from beaches to forests and deserts. The backbone of the state is the Sierra de Baja California, where the [[Picacho del Diablo]], the highest point of the peninsula, is located. This mountain range effectively divides the weather patterns in the state. In the northwest, the weather is semi-dry and [[mediterranean (climate)|mediterranean]]. In the narrow center, the weather changes to be more humid due to altitude. It is in this area where a few valleys can be found, such as the [[Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California|Valle de Guadalupe]], the major wine producing area in Mexico. To the east of the mountain range, the [[Sonoran Desert]] dominates the landscape. In the south, the weather becomes drier and gives way to the Vizcaino Desert. The state is also home to numerous islands off both of its shores. In fact, the westernmost point in Mexico, the [[Guadalupe Island]], is part of Baja California. The [[Coronado Islands|Coronado]], [[Isla Todos Santos|Todos Santos]] and [[Cedros Island]]s are also on the Pacific Shore. On the Gulf of California, the biggest island is the [[Angel de la Guarda Island|Angel de la Guarda]], separated from the peninsula by the deep and narrow [[Ballenas Fault|Canal de Ballenas]].

==History==
The first people came to the peninsula at least 11,000 years ago. At that time two main native groups are thought to have been present on the peninsula. In the south were the [[CochimÃ­]]. In the north were several groups belonging to the Yuman language family, including the [[Kiliwa]], [[Paipai]], [[Kumeyaay]], [[Cocopa]], and [[Quechan]]. These peoples were diverse in their adaptations to the region. The [[CochimÃ­]] of the peninsula's Central Desert were generalized hunter-gatherers who moved frequently; however, the CochimÃ­ on [[Cedros Island]] off the west coast had developed a strongly maritime economy. The Kiliwa, Paipai, and Kumeyaay in the better-watered northwest were also hunter-gatherers, but that region supported denser populations and a more sedentary lifestyle. The Cocopa and Quechan of northeastern Baja California practiced agriculture in the floodplain of the lower Colorado River.

Europeans reached the present state of Baja California in 1539, when [[Francisco de Ulloa]] reconnoitered its east coast on the [[Gulf of California]] and explored the peninsula's west coast at least as far north as Cedros Island. [[Hernando de AlarcÃ³n]] returned to the east coast and ascended the lower Colorado River in 1540, and [[Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo]] (or Joan Rodrigues Cabrilho {{pt}}) completed the reconnaissance of the west coast in 1542. [[SebastiÃ¡n VizcaÃ­no]] again surveyed the west coast in 1602, but outside visitors during the following century were few.

The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] founded a permanent mission colony on the peninsula at [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]] in 1697. During the following decades, they gradually extended their sway throughout the present state of Baja California Sur. In 1751â1753, the Croatian Jesuit mission-explorer [[Ferdinand KonÅ¡Äak]] made overland explorations northward into the state of Baja California. Jesuit missions were subsequently established among the CochimÃ­ at [[MisiÃ³n Santa Gertrudis|Santa Gertrudis]] (1752), [[MisiÃ³n San Francisco Borja|San Borja]] (1762), and [[MisiÃ³n Santa MarÃ­a de los Ãngeles|Santa MarÃ­a]] (1767).

After the [[Suppression of the Jesuits|expulsion of the Jesuits]] in 1768, the short-lived [[Franciscan]] administration (1768â1773) resulted in one new mission at [[MisiÃ³n San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±a de VelicatÃ¡|San Fernando VelicatÃ¡]]. More importantly, the 1769 expedition to settle Alta California under [[Gaspar de PortolÃ ]] and [[JunÃ­pero Serra]] resulted in the first overland exploration of the northwestern portion of the state.

The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] took over management of the Baja California missions from the Franciscans in 1773. They established a chain of new missions among the northern CochimÃ­ and western Yumans, first on the coast and subsequently inland, extending from [[MisiÃ³n Nuestra SeÃ±ora del SantÃ­simo Rosario de ViÃ±acado|El Rosario]] (1774) to [[MisiÃ³n El Descanso|Descanso]] (1817), just south of Tijuana.

Baja California encompasses a territory which exhibits diverse geography for a relatively small area. The [[Peninsula Ranges]] of the California cordillera run down the geographic center of the state. The most notable ranges of these mountains are the Sierra de Juarez and the Sierra de [[San Pedro Martir]]. These ranges are the location of forests cognizant of [[Southern California]]'s [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. Picacho del Diablo is the highest peak in the whole peninsula. Valleys between the mountain ranges are located within a climate zone that are suitable for agriculture. Such valleys included the [[Valle de Guadalupe, Baja California|Valle de Guadalupe]] and the Valle de Ojos Negros, areas that produce citrus fruits and grapes. The mineral rich mountain range extends southwards to the Gulf of California where the western slope becomes wider, forming the Llanos del Berrendo in the border with Baja California Sur. The mountain ranges located in the center and southern part of the state include the Sierra de La Asamblea, Sierra de CalamajuÃ©, Sierra de San Luis and the Sierra de San Borja.

Temperate winds from the Pacific Ocean and the cold [[California Current]] make the climate along the northwestern coast pleasant year round.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070625074430/http://smn.cna.gob.mx/productos/normales/estacion/bc/NORMAL02011.TXT NORMALES CLIMATOLÃGICAS 1971â2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Resulting from the states location on the California current, rains from the north barely reach the peninsula and leaves southern areas drier. South of El Rosario River the state changes from a Mediterranean landscape to a desert one. This desert exhibits diversity in succulent flora species that flourish in part due to the coastal fog.

To the east, the [[Sonoran Desert]] enters the state from both California and Sonora. Some of the highest temperatures in Mexico are recorded in or nearby the Mexicali Valley.&lt;ref&gt;Delta in the northeast, recorded 54.0 degrees celsius on 3 August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; However, with irrigation from the Colorado River, this area has become truly an [[Mexicali#The building of an agricultural empire|agricultural center]]. The Cerro Prieto geothermal province is near Mexicali as well (this area is geologically part of a large pull apart basin); producing about 80% of the electricity consumed in the state and enough more to export to California. [[Laguna Salada (Baja California)|Laguna Salada]], a saline lake below sea level lying between the rugged Sierra de Juarez and the Sierra de los Cucapah, is also in the vicinity of Mexicali. The state government has recently been considering plans to revive Laguna Salada.&lt;ref&gt;The state is currently (2008) looking at a plan by SDSU Adj. Professor Newcomb (ICATS) to do this using his geothermal desalination system to supply water locally. SEMARNAT believes this to be the first viable plan presented.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest mountain in the Sierra de los Cucapah is the Cerro del Centinela or Mount Signal. The Cucapah are the primary indigenous people of that area and up into the Yuma, AZ area.

There are numerous islands on the Pacific shore. [[Guadalupe Island]] is located in the extreme west of the state's boundaries and is the site of large colonies of sea lions. [[Cedros Island]] exists in the southwest of the state's maritime region. The Todos Santos Islands and [[Coronado Islands]] are located off the coast of Tijuana and Ensenada. All of the islands in the Gulf of California, on the Baja California side, belong to the municipality of Mexicali.

Baja California obtains much of its water from the [[Colorado River]]. Historically the river drained into the [[Colorado River Delta]] which flowed into the [[Gulf of California]], but due to large demands for water in the [[American Southwest]], less water now reaches the Gulf. The [[Tijuana metropolitan area]] also relies on the [[Tijuana River]] as a source of water.  Much of rural Baja California depends predominantly on wells and a few dams. Tijuana also purchases water from [[San Diego County]]'s Otay Water District. Potable water is the largest natural resource issue of the state.

===Climate===
[[File:Playas de Tijuana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Beach at Tijuana]]
Baja California's climate varies from [[Mediterranean Climate|Mediterranean]] to [[arid climate|arid]] climate zones. The [[Mediterranean climate]] is observed in the northwestern corner of the state where the summers are dry and mild and the winters cool and rainy. This climate is observed in areas from Tijuana to San Quintin and nearby interior valleys. The cold oceanic [[California Current]] often creates a low-level marine [[fog]] near the coast. The fog occurs along any part of the Pacific Coast of the state.

The change of altitude towards the Sierra de Baja California creates an alpine climate in this region. Summers are cool while winters can be cold with below freezing temperatures at night. It is common to see snow in the Sierra de Juarez and Sierra de San Pedro Martir (and in the valleys in between) from December to April.

The east side of the mountains produce a [[rain shadow]], creating an extremely arid environment. The Sonoran Desert region of Baja California experiences hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. The Mexicali Valley (which is below sea level), experiences the highest temperatures in Mexico, that frequently surpass {{convert|47|C|F|1}} in mid-summer, and have exceeded {{convert|50|C|F}} on some occasions.

Further south along the Pacific coast, the arid climate remains but it is milder and not as hot as along the gulf coast. Transition climates, from Mediterranean to Desert, can be found from San Quintin to El Rosario. Further inland and along the Gulf of California the vegetation is scarce and temperatures are very high during the summer months. The islands in the Gulf of California also belong to the desert climate. Some oases can be found in the desert in which few towns are located â for instance, Catavina, San Borja and Santa Gertrudis.

===Flora and fauna===
Common trees are the [[Jeffrey Pine]], [[Sugar Pine]] and [[Pinon Pine]].&lt;ref&gt;Katharine Layne Brandegee (1894) ''Zoe: Volume IV'', Zoe Publishing Company, Townshend Stith Brandegee&lt;/ref&gt; Understory species include [[Manzanita]]. Fauna include a variety of reptiles including the [[Western fence lizard]], which is at the southern extent of its range.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan (2008) &quot;[http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=55037 Western fence lizard (''Sceloporus occidentalis'')]&quot;, Globaltwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the fish genus ''[[Bajacalifornia]]'' is derived from the Baja California peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Townsend &amp; J. T. Nichols: Deep sea fishes of the 'Albatross' Lower California Expedition. Bulletin of the AMNH ; v. 52, article 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the main terrestrial wildlife refuges on the peninsula of Baja California, [[Constitution 1857 National Park]] and [[Sierra de San Pedro MÃ¡rtir National Park]] contain several coniferous species; the most abundant are: [[pinus jeffreyi]], [[pinus ponderosa]], [[pinus cembroide]], [[pinus quadrifolia]], [[pinus monophylla]], [[juniperus]], [[arctostaphylos drupacea]], [[artemisa ludoviciana]],  and [[adenostoma esparcifolium]]. The flora shares many species with the [[Laguna Mountains]] and [[San Jacinto Mountains]] in southwest California. The lower elevations of the Sierra JuÃ¡rez are characterized by [[chaparral]] and [[desert shrub]].

The fauna in the parks exhibit a large number of mammals primarily: [[Mule Deer]], [[Bighorn Sheep]], [[Cougar]], [[Bobcat]], [[Ringtail Cat]], [[Coyote]], [[Rabbit]], [[Squirrel]] and more than 30 species of [[Bat]]s. The park is also home to many avian species like: [[Bald Eagle]], [[Golden Eagle]], [[Falcon]], [[Woodpecker]], [[Black Vulture]], [[Crow]], several species of [[Sittidae]] and [[Duck]].

==Demographics==
[[File:GrandHotelTijuana&amp;TJCountryClub.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Country Club of Tijuana]]
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2011}}
The racial make-up of the state is approximately 40% [[White Mexican|White]]/[[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] (mostly but not limited to people of {{Clarify|date=September 2011}} descent), 36% [[Mestizo]] (Mixed Amerindian and European), 9% east Asian, the remaining 15% is Native American (of Mexican and Central American origins, {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} but includes [[Cherokees]] from the U.S. settled there in the 20th century) and a miniscule 1% of African descent. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Historically, the state has had sizable east Asian immigration, esp. Mexicali has a large Chinese community, as well as many [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] from the Philippines arrived to the state during the eras of Spanish and later American rule (1898â1946) in much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Tijuana and Ensenada were a major port of entry for east Asians entering the U.S. ever since the first [[Asian-American]]s were present in California.

Also a significant number of [[Middle Eastern]] immigrants such as [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrian]]s and [[Armenians]] settle near the U.S. border, and small waves of  settlers in the early 20th century, usually members of the [[Molokan]] sect of the [[Russian Orthodox]] church fled the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] of 1917 when the Soviet Union took power, had established a few villages along the Pacific coast south of [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Since 1960, large numbers of migrants from southern Mexican states have arrived to work in agriculture (esp. the Mexicali Valley and nearby [[Imperial Valley]], California, US) and manufacturing. The cities of Ensenada, Tijuana and Mexicali grew as a result of migrants, primarily those who sought US citizenship and those temporary residents awaiting their entry into the United States are called ''Flotillas'', which is derived from the Spanish word &quot;''flota'',&quot; meaning &quot;fleet.&quot;

There is also a sizable immigrant community from [[Central America|Central]] and South America, and from the United States and Canada. An estimated 200,000+ American [[expatriates]] live in the state, especially in coastal resort towns such as [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], known for affordable homes purchased by retirees who continue to hold US citizenship. [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], [[Rosarito (Baja California)|Rosarito]] and [[Tijuana]] also have a large American population (second largest in Mexico next to Mexico City), particularly for its cheaper housing and proximity to San Diego.

About 92% of Baja California's population is Christian, 81% of them are Catholics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Education==
[[File:CECUT.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tijuana's CECUT]]
* See [[:Category:Universities and colleges in Baja California]].

The state has 32 universities offering 103 professional degrees. These universities have 19 Research and Development centers for basic and applied investigation in advanced projects of Biotechnology, Physics, Oceanography, Digital Geothermal Technology, Astronomy, Aerospace, Electrical Engineering and Clean Energy, among others. At this educational level supply is steadily growing. Baja California has developed a need to be self-sufficient in matters of technological and scientific innovation and to be less dependent on foreign countries. Current businesses demand new production processes as well as technology for the incubation of companies. The number of various graduate degrees offered, including Ph.D. programs, is 121. The state has 53 graduate schools.&lt;ref name=GOBC&gt;[http://www.investinbaja.gob.mx/english/workforce/education.htm State Government of Baja California and Secretariat of Public Education].&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baja California's economy has a strong focus on tariff-free export oriented manufacturing ([[maquiladora]]). As of 2005, 284,255 people are employed in the manufacturing sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICM&quot; /&gt; There are a more than 900 companies operating under the federal [[Prosec Mexico|Prosec]] program in Baja California.

===Real estate===
The Foreign Investment Law of 1973&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lectlaw.com/files/int14.htm&lt;/ref&gt; allows foreigners to purchase land within the borders and coasts of Mexico by way of a trust, handled through a Mexican bank (Fideicomiso). This trust assures to the buyer all the rights and privileges of ownership, and it can be sold, inherited, leased, or transferred at any time. Since 1994, the Foreign Investment Law stipulates that the Fideicomiso must be to a 50 year term, with the option to petition for a 50 year renewal at any time.&lt;ref&gt;Mexico and Direct Foreign Ownership of Coastal Property, MexiData.info, 12 April 2010 http://www.mexidata.info/id2615.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Any Mexican citizen buying a bank trust property has the option to either remain within the Trust or opt out of it and request the title in âEscrituraâ.

Mexicoâs early history involved foreign invasions and the loss of vast amounts of land; in fear of history being repeated, the Mexican constitution established the concept of the âRestricted Zoneâ.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mexicolaw.com/LawInfo17.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, in order to bring in more foreign tourist investment, the Bank Trust of Fideicomiso was created, thus allowing non-Mexicans to own land without any constitutional amendment necessary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bajaopenhouse.com/Fideicomiso_-_Bank_Trust/page_1922035.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since the law went into effect, it has undergone many modifications in order to make purchasing land in Mexico a safer investment.
