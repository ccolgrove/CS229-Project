Founded in 1885 as the [[Normal School|Tempe Normal School]] for the [[Arizona Territory]], the school came under control of the [[Arizona Board of Regents]] in 1945 and was renamed ''Arizona State College.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/about/history/more.html History of ASU] Arizona State University&lt;/ref&gt; A 1958 statewide ballot measure gave the university its present name.

ASU offers programs in the [[liberal arts|liberal arts and sciences]], [[Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering|engineering]], [[journalism]], [[business school|business]], [[law school|law]], [[nursing]], and [[public policy]]. The university is broadly organized into 14 divisions and is spread across four campuses: the original [[Arizona State University at the Tempe campus|Tempe campus]], the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West campus]] in northwest [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], the [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic campus]] in eastern [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], and the [[Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix campus]]. All four campuses are accredited as a single institution by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncahlc.org/index.php?option=com_directory&amp;Itemid=192&amp;Action=ShowBasic&amp;instid=1002 Accreditation status of Arizona State University] Higher Learning Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

ASU's athletic teams compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and are collectively known as the [[Arizona State Sun Devils]]. They are members of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]] and have won 23 national championships.

==History==
{{Main|History of Arizona State University}}

===1880â1929===
[[File:ASU mall.jpg|thumb|left|250px|ASU mall from Old Main, 2009]]
Originally named the ''Tempe Normal School'', the institution was founded on March 12, 1885, after John Samuel Armstrong first introduced House Bill 164, &quot;An Act to Establish a [[Normal school]] in the [[Territory of Arizona]] to the [[13th Arizona Territorial Legislature|13th Legislative Assembly]] of the [[Arizona Territory]]. Instruction was instituted on February 8, 1886 under the supervision of Principal Hiram Bradford Farmer. Land for the school was donated by [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]] residents George and Martha Wilson, allowing 33 students to meet in a single room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/about/history/more.html More ASU History]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the school's name was changed from Tempe Normal School to the ''Normal School of Arizona''. Before becoming a college, the [[Normal School]] enrolled high school students with no other secondary education facilities. Under the 30 year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still currently in use. Matthews envisioned an &quot;evergreen campus,&quot; with many shrubbery brought to the campus. He also implemented the planting of [[Palm Walk]], now one of the feature landmarks of the Tempe campus. His legacy is being continued to this day with the main campus having the honor of being declared a nationally recognized arboretum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/fm/arboretum.htm The Arboretum at Arizona State University]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/preslist.htm Archives &amp; Special Collections, Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Although enrollment increased by almost 100% during his tenure due to the depression, many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/11lead.htm Eighth President Ralph Waldo Swetman 1930â1933]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930â1989===
[[Image:FLW Gammage Auditorium ASU PHX AZ 20186.JPG|thumb|250px|right|ASU's [[Gammage Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]]]
In 1933, [[Grady Gammage]], then president of Arizona State Teachers College at [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], became president of ''Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe'', a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years. Like his predecessor, Gammage oversaw the construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus. Dr. Gammage oversaw the development of the university, graduate programs, and the renaming of the ''Arizona State College'' to Arizona State University in 1958.

By the 1960s, with the presidency of Dr. [[G. Homer Durham]], Arizona State University began to expand its academic curriculum by establishing several new colleges and beginning to award [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and other doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/16lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three presidentsâHarry K. Newburn, 1969â71, John W. Schwada, 1971â81, and J. Russell Nelson, 1981â89âand Interim President Richard Peck, 1989, led the university to increased academic stature, creation of the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West Campus]], and rising enrollment.

===1990âpresent===
Under the leadership of Dr. Lattie F. Coor, from 1990 to June 2002, ASU grew to serve the Valley of the Sun through the creation of the [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic campus]] and extended education sites. His commitment to diversity, quality in [[undergraduate education]], research, and economic development underscored the university's significant gains in each of these areas over his 12-year tenure. Part of Dr. Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fund-raising campaign. Through private donations, primarily from the local community, more than $500 million was invested in targeted areas that significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of the [[Barrett, The Honors College|Barrett Honors College]], the [[Herberger College of the Arts|Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts]], and the Morrison School of Agribusiness and Resource Management at the Polytechnic campus; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/21lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Asubiodesign.jpg|thumb|250px|right|ASU's [[Biodesign Institute]] in Tempe campus]]
On July 1, 2002, [[Michael M. Crow|Michael Crow]] became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, President Crow outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a &quot;New American University&quot;âone that would be open and inclusive. As the only [[research university]] serving the metropolitan Phoenix area (and one of only two in Arizona), Crow stated that ASU is in a unique position to evolve together with the city into one of the great intellectual institutions in the world. Further, Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into &quot;One University in Many Places&quot; by merging ASU's several campuses into a single institution, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation.

Under Crow's leadership, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU embarked on an aggressive years-long research facility capital building effort, resulting in the completion of the [[Biodesign Institute]] and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of three [[Nobel Laureates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asunews.asu.edu/20091012_ostrom_nobel Nobel Prize Winners] ASU News&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ASU's [[Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix]] campus was vastly expanded. Several of the University's colleges and schools were relocated to the downtown campus, and new programs, such as a biomedical collaboration with the [[University of Arizona]] were established in downtown Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/news/research/biomed_pressconf_082704.htm ASU, UA join forces on biomedical campus plan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Late-2000s recession|economic downturn]] that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/01/16/20090116capitol-budget0116.html Budget Cuts Proposal] Arizona Republic&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these cuts, ASU underwent several rounds of reorganizations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://asunews.asu.edu/20090121_reorg Academic Reorganization]&lt;/ref&gt; combining academic departments, consolidating colleges and schools, and reducing university staff and administrators.

==Campuses and Locations==
ASU's academic programs are spread across four campuses in the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area]]; however, unlike most multi-campus institutions, ASU describes itself as &quot;one university in many places,&quot; meaning that it is not a [[university system]] with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.asu.edu One University in Many Places] Arizona State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;xvjbbz&quot;&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/provost/about/oneuniversity.html One University in Many Places] Explanation of the ASU campus organization&lt;/ref&gt; Inter-campus shuttles and [[light rail]] allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses. In addition to the physical campuses, ASU includes a fifth &quot;virtual campus&quot; for [[online education|online]] and extended education.

===Tempe campus===
