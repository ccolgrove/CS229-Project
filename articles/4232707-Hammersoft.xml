She studied [[acting]] and began getting cast for theatre roles. After marrying Jordan Rhodes she eventually moved to [[Los Angeles]] where she stopped acting for a while because she felt, as a stage actress, she didn't know very much about acting for television or movie roles. She eventually auditioned successfully for commercials roles, later moving on to television and film.

Her first credited roll was in the 60's television series ''[[The High Chaparral]]'' as the character Tanea. In 1980, she played a press secretary on a made-for-TV movie about [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jackie Kennedy]]. In 1989 she appeared in the [[New World Communications|New World Pictures]] film ''[[Heathers]]'' as [[Winona Ryder]]'s mother.

Although she never had children of her own, Jennifer is frequently recognized as &quot;[[Penelope Halliwell|Grams]]&quot; from [[WB Television Network|The WB]] series, ''[[Charmed]]'', where she portrayed the spirit of the Charmed Ones' grandmother. There she played the tough-as-nails matriarch of the Halliwell clan. Although not a regular, she is the only actress to have guest-starred in all eight seasons of the series.
