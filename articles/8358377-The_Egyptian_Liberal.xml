Estimated to employ 100,000 people, the SSI was the main security apparatus of Egypt's [[Ministry of Interior (Egypt)|Ministry of Interior]] and had the role of controlling opposition groups, both armed groups and those engaged in peaceful opposition to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Magnarella|1999|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sifton|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Egyptian and international human rights groups, as well as the United Nations Committee Against Torture, have documented widespread use of torture by the SSI, with Human Rights Watch singling out the SSI in what it called a &quot;pervasive culture of impunity&quot; with regard to torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellogg|el-Hamalawy|2005|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], the head of the SSI was arrested under suspicion of ordering the killings of demonstrators. On March 15, 2011, the Ministry of the Interior announced the dissolution of the agency. The service was replaced by the [[Egyptian Homeland security]].

The SSI is a branch of the Interior Ministry in eEgypt with an official aim of protecting the security of Egypt. The SSI has many official bureaus that provide its public face: an &quot;Investigative Bureau&quot; in the [[Lazoghli]] section of [[Cairo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.alkarama.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=22:communiqu&amp;id=234:egypt-whereabouts-of-17-people-held-incommunicado-between-1992-and-1997-leaked-by-released | title=Egypt: Whereabouts of 17 prisoners leaked by released prisoners | publisher=[[Alkarama]] for Human Rights | date=16 May 2009 | accessdate=10 March, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a &quot;Supreme State Security Court&quot; in [[Giza]], a &quot;Supreme State Security Prosecution&quot; (''Niyabat Amn al-Dawl a al-'Ulya''), etc. A diplomatic cable sent in 2007 published by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as part of the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leak of classified US diplomatic cables]] discussed what the then SSI head called the &quot;excellent and strong&quot; cooperation between the SSI and the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. The cable also discussed the benefit the SSI derived from training opportunities at the FBI's Quantico, Virginia headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/8314530/FBI-DEPUTY-DIRECTOR-MEETS-WITH-HEAD-OF-STATE-SECURITY.html FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR MEETS WITH HEAD OF STATE SECURITY] ''The Telegraph'', 9 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of torture ==
In a report in 2002, the United Nations Committee against Torture expressed &quot;particular concern at the widespread evidence of torture and ill-treatment in administrative premises under the control of the State Security Investigation Department, the infliction of which is reported to be facilitated by the lack of any mandatory inspection by an independent body of such premises.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/%28Symbol%29/CAT.C.CR.29.4.En?Opendocument Conclusions and recommendations of the Committee against Torture : Egypt] United Nations Committee against Torture. 23 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] reported that &quot;Egyptian authorities have a longstanding and well-documented record of engaging in arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detention, and torture and other ill-treatment of detainees,&quot; and that the SSI has in particular committed acts of torture and denied detainees fundamental human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sifton|2007|pp=12â13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US diplomatic cable reported that police brutality and torture are &quot;routine and pervasive&quot;. The cable also reported that the security services functioned as &quot;instruments of power that serve and protect the regime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/187359 US embassy cables: Police brutality in Egypt] ''The Guardian''. 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement in extraordinary rendition ==

Italian authorities investigating the [[extraordinary rendition|illegal abduction]] of Egyptian-born [[Imam Rapito affair|cleric]] [[Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr]], also known as Abu Omar from the streets of [[Milan]] on February 17, [[2003]] have said that his final disposition, after a flight from Aviano to Ramstein and then from Ramstein to Alexandria, was into the hands of the SSI.  At least one of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officials named in the indictment, [[Robert Seldon Lady]], is said to have accompanied Omar to Egypt, and to have spent two weeks in Cairo assisting in Omar's interrogation.

==2011 revolution and after==

{{main|2011 Egyptian revolution}}
One of the major demands of protesters during the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolution]] was the abolition of the State Security Investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/03/egypt-thousands-of-protesters-storm-into-state-security-headquarters.html | title=EGYPT: Thousands of protesters storm into state security headquarters |author=Hassa, Amro| publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] and [[Carnegie Middle East Center (CMEC)|Carnegie Middle East Center]] | date=5 March, 2011 1:51 pm | accessdate=10 March, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 25th of January 2011 Revolution, on the 4th &amp; 5th of March, 2011, several SSI buildings were raided across Egypt by protesters. Protesters state they raided in the buildings to secure documents they believed to show various crimes committed by the SSI against the people of Egypt during Mubarak's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/03/201134228359128.html | title = Egypt security building stormed: Protesters in Alexandria enter state security headquarters, saying officers destroyed documents to cover up past abuses | date = 5 Mar 2011 8:59 GMT| publisher = Al Jazeera }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 5 March in Cairo, &quot;the sight of a dump truck emerging from the Cairo compound laden with shredded paper sent protesters into a fury, creating the momentum that drove the crowd past the army soldiers outside and into the hastily abandoned main building.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT01&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/world/middleeast/10cairo.html?hp | title=Egyptians Get View of Extent of Spying |author=Stack, Liam and [[Neil MacFarquhar]]; Amr Emam contributed reporting| publisher=The New York Times | date=9 March, 2011) (10 March, 2011 p. A10 NY ed.| accessdate=10 March, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most notably at the [[Nasr City]] HQ in Cairo were many acquired documents which seemed to prove [[mass surveillance]] of citizens and many sexually explicit tapes of public figures as well as torturing tools and secret cells. Protesters broke into the building in [[Alexandria]] on March 4, after clashing with security forces, and on March 5 others entered the headquarters in the central city of [[Assiut]]. In Cairo, another building breached was in [[6th of October City]], where &quot;some of the most incriminating documents have already been destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref name=AlJ01&gt;{{cite news | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/spotlight/anger-in-egypt/2011/03/2011368410372200.html | title = A first step towards prosecutions? | first = Gregg | last = Carlstrom | date = 6 Mar 2011 | publisher = Al Jazeera }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[McClatchy Newspapers]] reported that, when there was much uncertainty about the validity of documents which emerged, &quot;[p]erhaps the most controversial document to ricochet around Internet message boards was one that purport[ed] to lay out State Security's involvement in [the] [[2011 Alexandria bombing | deadly church bombing]] on New Year's Day in the port city of Alexandria. ... The legitimacy of the document hasn't been determined, but its distribution touched off protests Sunday in Cairo by hundreds of Coptic Christians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/03/07/109966/egypt-faces-new-turmoil-looted.html#ixzz1GB3V4KOB | title=Egypt faces new turmoil: Looted state security files |author=Allam, Hannah and Mohannad Sabry| publisher=McClatchy Newspapers | date=7 March, 2011| accessdate=10 March, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other documents uncovered included names of judges involved in fixing elections and those of a small number of Egyptians who were informants. The publishing of these names posed a moral dilemma for some of the protesters, balancing the danger the informants would be put under against anger at having been spied on.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;

On 15 March 2011, SSIS was dissolved by Interior Minister [[Mansour el-Issawy]] in response to the revelations of the previous weeks. He also announced plans for the establishment of a new &quot;National Security Sector&quot; to take over SSIS's counter-terrorism and other domestic-security responsibilities.&lt;ref name=BBCdissolution&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12751234 | title=Egypt dissolves notorious internal security agency| publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=15 March 2011| accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
