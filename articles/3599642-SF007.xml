'''''Battle Isle''''' is a series of [[turn-based tactics]] [[computer game]]s developed in the 1990s by [[Blue Byte Software]]. The settings are wars on a fictional planet, Chromos.

==Storyline==
The ''Battle Isle'' storyline is set on a fictional planet called Chromos, whose society is technologically slightly more advanced than that of contemporary Earth, possessing the knowledge of advanced robotics ([[robot]]s), computers ([[AI]]s) and limited spaceflight (enough to set up [[space colony|space colonies]] on the moon of Chromos). The individual games represent various wars that took place on Chromos.

==Gameplay==
The first three games are played on a [[hexagonal]] grid for a map. Players not only control the combat units (ranging from [[infantry]] and [[tank]]s to [[helicopter]]s, [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] and [[bomber]]s, [[armored train]]s, surface [[warship]]s and [[submarine]]s, stationary gun turrets), but (especially in the later games) also many support [[logistics]] units (ammo and fuel transports, scout and radar units, road and construction vehicles, and others). Units have various weapons and can gain experience (which in later games can be transferred over in a campaign). Fuel and ammo is limited, and logistics need to be paid careful attention to. Players also control buildings, where units can be repaired, and sometimes, produced. Weather conditions change, affecting unit movements (for example, a sea or river can freeze, immobilizing ships but allowing light units to move through it). [[Fog of war]] is prevalent and players have to use scouting units to gain information about the battlefield. Some of those options were added in expansions or sequels.

Players have various tasks, ranging from eliminating all opponent forces to capturing specific buildings or protecting certain units or places. In some missions events from outside the battlefield can suddenly change the situation, giving players new objectives, reinforcements, allies or enemies. In some battles there are more than two sides, each with their own objectives, not all of them directly involved in hostilities - some of them can be even allied. At the same time, those allegiances can change because of some events or actions.

''Battle Isle'' one had the screen divided into two parts, one for each player. The turns were also divided into move and attack phases. While one player moved his units, the other commanded his own troops to carry out his actions. ''Battle Isle 2'' gave the player the entire screen, and merged move and attack phases, and introduced the 3-D display of combat. ''Battle Isle 3'' was very similar to ''Battle Isle 2'', with improved graphics, more units and a new storyline. ''Battle Isle: The Andosian War'' was entirely set in the 3-D environment and combined elements of real-time and turn-based strategies.

The [[game artificial intelligence|AI]] is relatively weak, relying on [[rush (video games)|mass frontal assaults]]. After a player survives the first few turns and the AI's overwhelming numbers using protected artillery and terrain advantage, the computer is usually unable to mount a proper defense.

==History==
''Battle Isle'' was Blue Byte's first big success in [[Germany]] and [[Europe]]. It was completed in 1991. Inspired by the [[Japan]]ese game ''[[Nectaris]]'' for the [[PC Engine]], ''Battle Isle'' spawned numerous add-ons, sequels (most notable are ''Battle Isle 2'' from 1993 and ''Battle Isle 3'' from 1995) and imitations. Of those among the most notable is BlueByte's own ''[[History Line: 1914-1918]]'' from 1993, which moves the [[science fiction]]ish climate of ''Battle Isle'' into the times of [[First World War]]. Others include the [[open source]] projects of ''[[Crimson Fields]]'' and ''[http://asc-hq.org/ ''Advanced Strategic Command'']''.

After the release of ''Battle Isle 2'' Blue Byte decided to release a Windows version on CD that was internally referred to as ''Win CD''. This would be one of the very first games for Windows (3.11/95 and NT). The program was to be converted to Windows while the maps where to be replaced with new ones and a new storyline was to be written. The project was led by Patric Lagny who wrote the video player for ''Battle Isle 2'' and had many of the original graphic artists from the ''Battle Isle 2'' team. While the program was being developed, Blue Bytes Marketing Department suggested to name this product ''Battle Isle 3''  instead of marketing it as a ''Data CD for Battle Isle 2'' with Windows support.

''Battle Isle'' achieved cult status, with over 600,000 copies having been sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluebyte.net/battleisle-e/products/overview.asp|title=Battle Isle - Overview|publisher=bluebyte.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two [[expansion pack|data disks]] released for ''Battle Isle 1'', and one for ''Battle Isle 2''. ''Battle Isle 3'' represented the most developed variant of ''Battle Isle 2''. However, in the late 1990s Blue Byte decided that the old model was no longer sufficient and decided to change the model of the series.

In 1997 a new ''Battle Isle'' game was released as a [[3D computer graphics|3-D]] tactical squad game: ''[[Incubation (computer game)|Incubation]]'', similar to ''[[UFO: Enemy Unknown]]''; later in 2001 ''Battle Isle: The Andosia War'' which tried to bridge the gap between turn-based strategies and [[real-time strategy|real-time strategies]], but both titles, while mildly successful, alienated many older players who had come to expect that the ''Battle Isle'' brand would represent traditional, [[board game]] style games.

Blue Byte attempted to use the ''Battle Isle'' brand name on yet another game (and genre), this time a [[MMORPG]] ''[[DarkSpace]]'', which for a time was known as ''Battle Isle V: DarkSpace'', but after Blue Byte was bought by [[Ubisoft]] the ''DarkSpace'' became an independent project.

The first games were available for the [[operating system]]s [[Amiga]] and [[DOS]]. Later, [[Microsoft Windows]] became the target for the games.

{{As of|2010}}, there is no official ''Battle Series'' game in development.

==Clones==
[[File:Crimson.png|thumb|right|200px|''Crimson Fields'']]

Battle Isle has inspired two [[free software|free]] [[open source]] [[video game clone|clone]]s:
*''Advanced Strategic Command'' has two modes of play: one very similar to ''Battle Isle'' and its own, with more complex management of resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terdon.asc-hq.org/knowledgebase/browse.php?topic=doc&amp;title=ASC+Documentation&amp;expand=yes#A22 ASC Documentation: Resource management]&lt;/ref&gt; It is available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc-hq.org/ Advanced Strategic Command] homepage&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Crimson Fields'' follows the original ''Battle Isle'' game mechanics closely, except that it doesn't allow for building of new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Crimson Fields [http://crimson.seul.org/docs/crimson.html manual]&lt;/ref&gt; The game is available on a variety of platforms, including [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[BeOS]], [[Dreamcast]] and [[AROS]]. It is also [[software portability|ported]] to a number of embedded devices: [[Sharp Zaurus]], [[Nokia 770]], [[Windows CE]], [[Windows Mobile]] ([[Pocket PC]]), [[Palm OS]] 5, [[Android (operating system)|Android]], iStation V43 and [[GP2X]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://crimson.seul.org/download.php Crimson Fields - Downloads]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both clones include a [[map editor]] and a converter that can load ''Battle Isle'' and ''History Line'' maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crimson.seul.org/ Crimson Fields] homepage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://terdon.asc-hq.org/knowledgebase/browse.php?topic=doc&amp;title=ASC+Documentation&amp;expand=yes#A60 ASC Documentation: Importieren von Battle-Isle-Karten (Linux)]&lt;/ref&gt;
