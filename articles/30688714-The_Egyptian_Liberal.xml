Karman is a [[Yemen]]i journalist, politician and senior member of [[Al-Islah]] political party, and [[human rights in Yemen|human rights activist]] who heads the group &quot;Women Journalists Without Chains,&quot; which she co-founded in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakkaf&quot; /&gt; She gained prominence in her country after 2005 in her roles as a Yemeni journalist and an advocate for a mobile phone news service denied a license in 2007, after which she led protests for press freedom.

She has been a vocal opponent who has called for the end of President's [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feb3_DayRage_aljaz&quot; /&gt;

==Personal life==
Tawakel Karman was born on 7 February 1979 in [[Mekhlaf]], [[Ta'izz Governorate | Ta'izz]] province, Yemen. She grew up near [[Taiz]], which is the third largest city in Yemen and is described as a place of learning in a conservative country.&lt;ref name=&quot;emblem&quot; /&gt; She is the daughter of Abdel Salam Karman, a lawyer and politician, who once served and later resigned as Legal Affairs Minister in Ali Abdullah Saleh's government.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview2&quot; /&gt; She is the sister of Tariq Karman, who is a poet,&lt;ref name=&quot;Filkins&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Filkins |first=Dexter |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/11/110411fa_fact_filkins |title=Yemenâs Protests and the Hope for Reform |publisher=The New Yorker |date=1 August 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Safa Karman, who works for ''[[Al-Jazeera]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEMRI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=www.memri.org |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/5744.htm#_edn1 |title=Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Tawakkul Karman â A Profile |publisher=Memri.org |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is married to Mohammed al-Nahmi&lt;ref name=&quot;mother&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;undaunted&quot; /&gt; and is the mother of three children.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;/&gt;

Karman earned an undergraduate degree in commerce from the [[University of Science and Technology, Sana'a]] and a graduate degree in political science from the [[University of Sanaa | University of Sana'a]].&lt;ref name=&quot;emblem&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEMRI&quot;/&gt; 

At a protest in 2010, a woman attempted to stab her with a [[jambiya]] but Karman's supporters managed to stop the assault.&lt;ref name=&quot;undaunted&quot;&gt;Tom Finn. &quot;Middle East/Yemen: Undaunted by death threats: the thorn in Saleh's side.&quot; The Guardian, 26 March 2011.

According to Tariq Karman, &quot;a senior Yemeni official&quot; threatened his sister Tawakel with death in a telephone call on 26 January 2011 if she continued her public protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBS&quot;&gt;http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/obs_2011_uk-mmo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dexter Filkins]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', the official was President Saleh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Filkins&quot; /&gt;

==Women Journalists Without Chains==
Tawakel Karman co-founded the human rights group [[Women Journalists Without Chains]] (WJWC) with seven other female journalists in 2005 in order to promote human rights, &quot;particularly freedom of opinion and expression, and democratic rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FJWB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yobserver.com/local-news/1004126.html |title=Female Journalists without Borders |publisher=Yobserver.com |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was founded as &quot;Female Reporters Without Borders,&quot; the present name was adopted in order to get a government license.&lt;ref name=&quot;JAWA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jane | postCount('209666'); | |url=http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/209666.php |title=The Jawa Report: Yemeni Activist wins Nobel Prize |publisher=Mypetjawa.mu.nu |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karman has said she has received &quot;threats and temptations&quot; and was the target of harrassment from the Yemeni authorities by telephone and letter because of her refusal to accept the Ministry of Information rejection of WJWC's application to legally create a newspaper and a radio station. The group advocated freedom for [[SMS]] news services, which had been tightly controlled by the government despite not falling under the purview of the Press Law of 1990. After a governmental review of the text services, the only service that was not granted a license to continue was ''Bilakoyood'', which belonged to WJWC and had operated for a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;bilakoyood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yobserver.com/front-page/10012729.html |title=Blacklist names worst violators of press freedom |publisher=Yobserver.com |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Filkins&quot; /&gt; In 2007, WJWC released a report that documented Yemeni abuses of press freedom since 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;bilakoyood&quot; /&gt; In 2009, she criticised the Ministry of Information for establishing trials that targeted journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview2&quot; /&gt; From 2007 to 2010, Karman regularly led demonstrations and [[sit-in]]s in [[Tahrir Square, Sana'a]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakkaf&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazaward&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/10/201110773943904523.html |title=Three women share Nobel Peace Prize â Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 October 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tawakel Karman was affiliated with the ''[[Al-Thawrah, Yemen | Al-Thawrah]]'' newspaper at the time she founded WJWC in March 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;FJWB&quot;/&gt; She is also a member of the Yemeni Journalists' Syndicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/ifj-welcomes-nobel-peace-prize-award-to-yemeni-journalist |title=IFJ Global - IFJ Welcomes Nobel Peace Prize Award to Yemeni Journalist |publisher=IFJ.org |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
[[File:Karman interview across from UN, Oct 18, 2011.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tawakel Karman protests outside the UN building, 18 October 2011.]] Tawakel Karman is a member of the opposition party [[Al-Islah]] and holds a position on its [[Shura Council]], which is a party position.&lt;ref name=&quot;emblem&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2011/10/07/1186693-tawakkol-karman-figure-emblematique-du-soulevement-au-yemen.html |title=Tawakkol Karman, figure emblÃ©matique du soulÃ¨vement au YÃ©men - L'Ã©vÃ©nement : LaDÃ©pÃªche.fr |publisher=Ladepeche.fr |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karman started protests as an advocate for press freedoms in her country. At a time when she was advocating for more press freedom, she responded to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in 2005 by writing: &quot;We are not to call for tyranny and bans on freedom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JAWA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tawakkol http://armiesofliberation.com/archives/2006/02/19/burning-embassys-is-not-the-way/&lt;/ref&gt;

She stopped wearing the traditional ''[[niqab]]'' in favour of more colourful [[Hijab|''hijabs'']] that showed her face. She first appeared without the ''niqab'' at a conference in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview2&quot; /&gt; Karman replaced the ''niqab'' for the scarf in public on national television to make her point that the full covering is cultural and not dictated by Islam.&lt;ref name=&quot;thorn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Tom Finn in Sana'a |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/25/tawakul-karman-yemeni-activist-saleh |title=Tawakul Karman, Yemeni activist, and thorn in the side of Saleh &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 March 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0124/Yemen-releases-jailed-activists-in-the-face-of-Tunisia-inspired-protesters/(page)/2 |title=Yemen releases jailed activists in the face of Tunisia-inspired protesters |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told the [[Yemen Times]] in 2010 that:&lt;ref name=&quot;interview2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Women should stop being or feeling that they are part of the problem and become part of the solution. We have been marginalized for a long time, and now is the time for women to stand up and become active without needing to ask for permission or acceptance. This is the only way we will give back to our society and allow for Yemen to reach the great potentials it has.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She has alleged that many Yemeni girls suffer from malnutrition so that boys could be fed and also called attention to high illiteracy rates, which includes two-thirds of Yemeni women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Tawakul-Karman-gets-2011-Nobel-Peace-Prize,-leads-Yemeni-womenâs-Arab-spring-22846.html | title=Tawakul Karman gets 2011 Nobel Peace Prize, leads Yemeni womenâs Arab spring | date=7 October 2011 | accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has advocated for laws that would prevent females younger than 17 from being married. 

Karman took a different stand on marriage law than others in the Al-Islah party but she claims it is the party most open to women. In clarifying her position, she said:&lt;ref&gt;Tom Finn. &quot;Peace prize: Women who fought and won unequal struggles. The Guardian, 8 October 2011. Retrieved 11 October 2011 from the Lexis-Nexis Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our party needs the youth but the youth also need the parties to help them organise. Neither will succeed in overthrowing this regime without the other. We don't want the international community to label our revolution an Islamic one.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She has also led protests against government corruption. Her stand on the ouster of Saleh became stronger after village lands of families around the city of [[Ibb]] were appropriated by a corrupt local leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;undaunted&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph&quot; /&gt;

She is a moderate in a political party with more conservative members who have formed a coalition to oppose Saleh and the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon |first=Erika |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/07/us-yemen-karman-nobel-idUSTRE79638920111007 |title=Yemen Nobel laureate a figure of hope, controversy |publisher=Reuters |date=7 October 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her membership in Al-Islah is controversial because of [[Abdul Majeed al-Zindani]]'s membership in the same party. Zindani was the head of the [[Muslim Brotherhood#Yemen | Yemeni Muslim Brotherhood]] and is currently the head of the [[Salafi]] wing of the party, which has taken more conservative stances on women and marriage. He is also listed on the United States [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]]'s [[Specially Designated Nationals (SDN)#Specially Designated Nationals List | Specially Designated Nationals List]], a list which the U.S. has used to prevent money from being transferred from charities or businesses to terrorist groups. Zindani has long been associated with [[Anwar al-Awlaki]], who was killed by a U.S. Hellfire missile fired in a drone attack 30 September 2011. The United States linked Awlaki to terrorist attacks and [[Al-Qaeda]]. Yemeni journalist Nasir Arrabayee reported that the last three locations where sources said Awlaki had visited were either the home of a relative or the homes of Al-Islah members, including the home of Zindani.&lt;ref&gt;Nasir Arrabayee. &quot;Can Yemen Crisis Be Internationalized More?&quot; Yemen Observer, 8 October 2011.

Karman, who claims independence from the party line, said, &quot;I do not represent the Al-Islah party, and I am not tied to its positions. My position is determined by my beliefs, and I do not ask anyone's permission.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEMRI&quot; /&gt;

Likewise, she says she remains independent from foreign influences: &quot;I do have close strategic ties with American organizations involved in protecting human rights, with American ambassadors and with officials in the U.S. State Department. (I also have ties with activists in) most of the E.U. and Arab countries. But they are ties among equals; (I am not) their subordinate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEMRI&quot; /&gt;

Speaking before an audience at the University of Michigan, Karman summed up her belief: &quot;I am a citizen of the world. The Earth is my country, and humanity is my nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Lerner | first = Charlene | title = Nobel Prize winner highlights womenâs role in Arab Spring | newspaper = The Michigan Daily | date=15 November 2011 | url = http://www.michigandaily.com/news/nobel-peace-prize-winner-talks-about-womans-activism-yemen | accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 protests==
[[File:Yemen protest.jpg|thumb|250px|Protest on the &quot;Day of Rage&quot; that Karman had called for in Sana'a, Yemen, from 3 February 2011.]] During the ongoing [[2011 Yemeni protests]], Tawakel Karman organised student rallies in [[Sana'a]] in protest against the long-standing rule of Saleh's government. On 22 January, she was stopped while driving with her husband by three plain-clothed men without police identification and taken to prison,&lt;ref name=&quot;Filkins&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OBS&quot; /&gt; where she was held for 36 hours until she was released on parole on 24 January. In a 9 April editorial that appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'', she wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Tawakkol Karman. &quot;Our revolution's doing what Saleh can't - uniting Yemen.&quot; The Guardian, 9 April 2011. Retrieved 8 October 2011 from the Lexis-Nexis Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a week of protests I was detained by the security forces in the middle of the night. This was to become a defining moment in the Yemeni revolution: media outlets reported my detention and demonstrations erupted in most provinces of the country; they were organised by students, civil society activists and politicians. The pressure on the government was intense, and I was released after 36 hours in a women's prison, where I was kept in chains.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She then led another protest on 29 January where she called for a &quot;Day of Rage&quot; on 3 February&lt;ref name=&quot;Feb3_DayRage_aljaz&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=New protests erupt in Yemen |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/01/2011129112626339573.html |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=29 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w8S9MZ1r |archivedate=30 January 2011 |deadurl=no |accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to that of the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] that were in turn inspired by the [[Tunisian revolution|2010â2011 Tunisian revolution]]. On 17 March, she was re-arrested amidst ongoing protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/23/yemen-arrests-protest-leader |location=London |work=The Guardian  | first=Tom | last=Finn | title=Yemen arrests anti-government activist | date=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the uprising she had said that: &quot;We will continue until the fall of Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime...We have the Southern Movement in the south, the (Shia) Huthi rebels in the north, and parliamentary opposition...But what's most important now is the jasmine revolution.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feb3_DayRage_aljaz&quot;/&gt; She has set at the protest camp for months along with her husband.&lt;ref name=&quot;mother&quot;/&gt;

Karman has had some tense disagreements with other organisers, especially after she urged protesters to march to the Presidential Palace in May as a response to the killing of 13 protesters by security forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yemen&quot; /&gt;

On 18 June she wrote an article entitled &quot;Yemen's Unfinished Revolution&quot; in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in which she assailed the United States and Saudi Arabia for their support for the &quot;corrupt&quot; Saleh regime in Yemen because they &quot;used their influence to ensure that members of the old regime remain in power and the status quo is maintained.&quot; She argued that American intervention in Yemen was motivated by the [[war on terror]] and was not responsive to either the human rights abuses in Yemen or the calls from Yemenâs democracy movement. She affirmed that the protesters in Yemen also wanted stability in the country and region.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;/&gt; In an interview on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', Karman said, &quot;In our weekly protests in front of the cabinet, we called on the government to allow people to have freedom of speech and for people to be able to own online newspapers. We knew and know that freedom of speech is the door to democracy and justice, and also that part of the freedom of speech is the freedom of movement... The culture of freedom and protests spread all over Yemen. Every time we stood up for our rights the government answered with violence or interfered in our rights....&quot; She credited Tunisia for inspiring others around the Middle East for the Arab Spring protests.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/seo/2011/10/21/exclusive_nobel_laureate_tawakkul_karman_on&lt;/ref&gt;

During the protests, Karman was part of a large number of women activists -- up to 30 percent of the protestors -- demanding change in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kalpana Sharma |url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/Kalpana_Sharma/article2573489.ece |title=Columns / Kalpana Sharma : The Other Half: Women and the Arab Spring |publisher=The Hindu |date=29 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 October, government snipers in Taiz shot and killed [[Aziza Othman Kaleb]], ''[[CNN]]'' reported she was the first woman to have been killed during the Yemen protests but could not verify this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/17/world/meast/yemen-unrest/index.html?iref=allsearch |title=Women march in Yemen's capital |publisher=CNN |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten days later, women in Sana'a protested against the violent force used against them by burning their ''[[makrama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/8853028/Yemeni-women-burn-their-veils-in-anti-government-protest-after-more-deaths-in-Sanaa.html |title=Video: Yemeni women burn their veils in anti-government protest after more deaths in Sanaa |publisher=Telegraph |date=27 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jezebel.com/5853773/yemeni-women-burn-veils-to-protest-government-crackdown |title=Yemeni Women Burn Veils To Protest Government Crackdown |publisher=Jezebel.com |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the time, Karman was in Washington, D.C., where she said the female protesters who burned their makrama were &quot;reject(ing) the injustice that the Saleh regime has imposed on them. And this is a new stage for the Yemeni women, because they will not hide behind veils or behind walls or anything else.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clinton&quot;&gt;United States Department of State. 23 October 2011. &quot;Remarks With Yemeni Nobel Prize Winner Tawakkul Karman After Their Meeting.&quot; Retrieved 6 November 2011 [http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2011/10/176354.htm US State Dept.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement of international government organizations===
After the Nobel Peace Prize announcement, Tawakel Karman became increasingly involved in mobilizing world opinion and United Nations Security Council members to assist the protesters in ousting Saleh and bringing him before the international court.

She lobbied the United Nations Security Council and the United States not to make deal that would pardon Saleh, but instead hold him accountable, freeze his assets and support the protesters. The [[United Nations Security Council]] voted 15-0 on 21 October on [[Security Council Resolution 2014]] that &quot;strongly condemns&quot; Saleh's government for the use of deadly force against protesters, but it also backed the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]]'s (GCC) initiative that would give Saleh immunity from prosecution should he resign. Karman, who was present for the vote, criticised the Council's support for the GCC's proposal and instead advocated that Saleh stand trial at the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iH2ZeqgaMINbPDDzaRbqtKeP0S6w?docId=CNG.e1771690f71c3d2c94aa0c8833fbddc0.361 |title=AFP: UN Council calls on Saleh to hand over power |publisher=Google.com |date=21 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karman also met the United States' Secretary of State [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] on 28 October to discuss the same United Nations Resolution, to which Clinton said &quot;the United States supports a democratic transition in Yemen and the rights of the people of Yemen â men and women â to choose their own leaders and futures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clinton&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WP&quot;&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Washington Post | title=Secy Clinton Praises Yemeni Nobel Winner Calls for Revolution to Bring Democracy | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secy-clinton-praises-yemeni-nobel-winner-calls-for-revolution-to-bring-democracy/2011/10/28/gIQAT7fdPM_story.html | date=28 October 2011 | accessdate=15 November 2011 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karman responded to the comment through the Yemini press by saying, &quot;in Yemen, it has been nine months that people have been camped in the squares. Until now we didn't see that [[Barack Obama|Obama]] came to value the sacrifice of the Yemeni people. Instead the American administration is giving guarantees to Saleh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&amp;SubID=4252&amp;MainCat=3 |title=Yemeni Activist Tawakkul Karman Takes on the White House- Yemen Post English Newspaper Online |publisher=Yemen Post |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saleh signed the Gulf Cooperation Council's plan 23 November 2011 in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. Saleh would transfer his powers to Vice President [[Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi]] to start a political transition, according to the terms of the agreement.&lt;ref name=resigns&gt;{{cite news|last=Finn|first=Tom|title=Yemen president quits after deal in Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/23/yemen-president-quits?intcmp=239|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The Guardian (U.K.)|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 Nobel Peace Prize==
Karman became the [[List of female Nobel laureates|first Arab woman]], the youngest person ever to become a Nobel Peace Laureate and the category's second muslim woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2011/10/7/yemeni_activist_tawakkul_karman_first_female |title=Yemeni Activist Tawakkul Karman, First Female Arab Nobel Peace Laureate: A Nod for Arab Spring |publisher=Democracynow.org |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 32, Tawakel Karman is the youngest winner of a Nobel Peace Prize. She is younger (born 7 February 1979) than [[Mairead Maguire]] (born 27 January 1944), who was a co-recipient of the award in 1976 and previously held that record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Youngest Nobel Laureates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/faq/nobel_laureates.html |title=Nobel Laureates â FAQ |publisher=nobelprize.org |accessdate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Shirin Ebadi]] was the first Persian woman and first muslim woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Before the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded, only 12 other women had ever been recipients in its 110 years, and now there are 15 women. 

Karman, along with [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]] and [[Leymah Gbowee]], were the co-recipients of the the 2011 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] &quot;for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for womenâs rights to full participation in peace-building work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel&quot;/&gt; Of Karman, the Nobel Committee said: &quot;In the most trying circumstances, both before and during the 'Arab spring', Tawakkul Karman has played a leading part in the struggle for womenâs rights and for democracy and peace in Yemen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; The Nobel Committee cited the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted in 2000, which states that women and children suffer great harm from war and political stability and that women must have a larger influence and role in peacemaking activities; it also &quot;[c]alls on all actors involved, when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to adopt a gender perspective.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/events/res_1325e.pdf United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, adopted 31 October 2000]. Retrieved 10 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon announcing the award, former Norwegian Prime Minister and chairman of the committee to decide the award [[Thorbjorn Jagland]] said: &quot;We cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society.&quot; He later added that the prize was &quot;a very important signal to women all over the world&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;/&gt; and that, despite the events of the [[Arab Spring]], &quot;there are many other positive developments in the world that we have looked at. I think it is a little strange that researchers and others have not seen them.&quot; He had earlier said the prize for the year would be &quot;very powerful... but at the same time very unifying [and would] not create as strong reactions from a single country as it did last year [with [[Liu Xiaobo]]].&quot; The 2011 prize is to be divided equally among the three recipients,&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel&quot;/&gt; from a total of 10 million [[Swedish kronor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts.html |title=The Nobel Prize Amounts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;/&gt;

In reaction to the award Karman, while camped out in Sana'a during ongoing anti-government protests, said: &quot;I didnât expect it. It came as a total surprise. This is a victory for Arabs around the world and a victory for Arab women&quot; and that the award was a &quot;victory of our peaceful revolution. I am so happy, and I give this award to all of the youth and all of the women across the Arab world, in Egypt, in Tunisia. We cannot build our country or any country in the world without peace,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Nobel Peace Prize Awarded to Three Activist Women |first= |last= |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/world/nobel-peace-prize-johnson-sirleaf-gbowee-karman.html?_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=19 November 2011 |first1=Alan |last1=Cowell |first2=Laura |last2=Kasinof |first3=Adam |last3=Nossiter}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding that it was also for &quot;Libya, Syria and Yemen and all the youth and women, this is a victory for our demand for citizenship and human rights,&quot; that &quot;all Yemenis [are] happy over the prize.

=== Post-Nobel Prize ===
After the announcement, Karman traveled to [[Qatar]] where she met with Sheikh [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani]] and also requested the [[Doha Centre for Media Freedom]]'s assistance to set up a television and radio station, which would be named ''[[Balqis]]'', in honour of the [[Queen of Sheba]], in order to support female journalists and to broadly educate Yemeni journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.al-sharq.com/articles/more.php?id=261049 |title=Ø§ÙÙÙÙØ¹ Ø§ÙØ±Ø³ÙÙ ÙØ¬Ø±ÙØ¯Ø© Ø§ÙØ´Ø±Ù Ø§ÙÙØ·Ø±ÙØ© |publisher=Al-sharq.com |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also made a video message in Washington, D.C. on 25 October on the occasion of the release of the 14th annual report of the [[Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders]] (OBS) by the [[International Federation of Human Rights]] (FIDH) and the [[World Organisation Against Torture]] (OMCT). The report included information about the [[Arab Spring]], Yemen, and Karman.&lt;ref name=&quot;OBS&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/206487.html |title=PressTV - HR defenders main targets of violent attacks |publisher=Presstv.ir |date=25 October 2011 |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fidh.org/Launch-of-the-2011-Annual-Report |title=Launch of the 2011 Annual Report of the Observatory at the United Nations Headquarters in New York - FIDH - Worldwide Human Rights Movement |publisher=FIDH |date=|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
