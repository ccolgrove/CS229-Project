The '''[[Kenya]] national [[Rugby sevens#Rugby union sevens|rugby union sevens]] team''' compete in the [[IRB Sevens World Series]] and [[Rugby World Cup Sevens]]. They are currently one of the 12 &quot;core teams&quot; of the IRB Sevens, with a guaranteed place in all eight events each season.

They are also hosts at the annual [[Safari Sevens]] which have been held at the [[RFUEA Ground]] in [[Nairobi]] every year since 1996.

Kenya have sometimes mistakenly been referred to as ''Shujaa'' by the international press; in fact Shujaa are the Kenya sevens 'A' (or second) team.  Shujaa is a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word (also used as a boys' name) meaning courage, confidence, bravery, prowess or heroism.

== History ==
{{main|Rugby union in Kenya}}
===2001 to 2004===
Qualifying for the [[2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens|2001 World Cup]] finals in [[Argentina]] perhaps signified the start of Kenyan rugby's presence in world class sevens tournaments, they went on to beat overwhelming favourites [[France national rugby union team (sevens)|France]] in the competition 12-7. At the [[2002 Commonwealth Games]], Kenya beat [[Samoa national rugby union team (sevens)|Samoa]] 28-20 and almost defeated [[England national rugby union team (sevens)|England]].  During the [[2003â04 World Sevens Series|2003 IRB Sevens circuit]] Kenya beat [[Wales national rugby union team (sevens)|Wales]] 19-0 in the South African leg of the tournament and [[Australia national rugby union team (sevens)|Australia]] 15-12 in Hong Kong.

The upswelling of support for the team at home resulted in rugby sevens being admitted as a formal sport in Kenyan secondary schools in 2004.  Kenya then qualified for their second World Cup Sevens finals held [[2005 Rugby World Cup Sevens|2005]] in [[Hong Kong]].

===2005 to 2008===
They defeated [[Australia national rugby union team (sevens)|Australia]] for a second time, winning 26-7 in the [[2005â06 World Sevens Series|London Sevens 2006]], and went on to reach the Final of the Plate competition. In the [[Rugby sevens at the 2006 Commonwealth Games|2006 Commonwealth Games]] Kenya came third in their pool and went on to win the bowl upsetting [[Tonga national rugby union team (sevens)|Tonga]] 26-12 in the final.  In the [[2006â07 IRB Sevens World Series|2007]] [[2007 Wellington Sevens|Wellington Sevens]] in [[New Zealand]], Kenya came in their pool, beating such rugby giants as [[Argentina national rugby union team (sevens)|Argentina]] and [[Tonga national rugby union team (sevens)|Tonga]], before being narrowly defeated in the quarter-finals by [[Samoa national rugby union team (sevens)|Samoa]].  At the [[2007 South Africa Sevens]] Kenya beat [[Zimbabwe national rugby union team (sevens)|Zimbabwe]] and [[England national rugby union team (sevens)|England]] in the pool stages and advanced to win the Plate competition defeating fellow surprise package the [[USA national rugby union team (sevens)|USA]] 15-14.

===2009===
Kenya reached the semifinals at the [[2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens]], eventually going down to [[Argentina national rugby union team (sevens)|Argentina]]. In [[2008â09 IRB Sevens World Series|that year's]] IRB Sevens World Series, Kenya reached a main Cup final for the first time at the [[2009 Adelaide Sevens]], beating [[South Africa national rugby union team (sevens)|South Africa]], [[New Zealand national rugby union team (sevens)|New Zealand]] and [[Fiji national rugby union team (sevens)|Fiji]] to get there.  They lost to [[South Africa national rugby union team (sevens)|South Africa]] in the Final;&lt;ref&gt;IRB, April 5, 2009: [http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/edition=9/news/newsid=2030511.html#south+africa+retain+adelaide+sevens South Africa retain Adelaide Sevens]&lt;/ref&gt; the first time a final featured all-African sides.  Additionally, at the end of that series [[Collins Injera]] was top try-scorer for the season with 42 (South Africaâs [[Ryno Benjamin]] and Argentinaâs all time leading try scorer in Sevens, [[Santiago Gomez Cora]], shared second place with 28 tries each). Injera also came second as the best points scorer for the season (210 points) behind [[Ben Gollings]] of [[England national rugby union team (sevens)|England]] (260 points).
