A '''lockout''' is a [[work stoppage]] in which an [[employer]] prevents employees from working. This is different from a [[strike action|strike]], in which employees refuse to work.

== Causes ==

A lockout may happen for several reasons. One reason is so that employers can lower its costs by using a lockout to force unionized workers to accept lower wages. If the union is asking for higher wages, or better benefits, an employer may use the threat of a lockout or an actual lockout to convince the union to back down.

== Lock-in ==

The term ''lock-in'' refers to the practice of physically preventing workers from leaving a workplace. In most jurisdictions this is illegal but is occasionally reported, especially in some developing countries. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

More recently, lock-ins have been carried out by employees against management, which have been labelled '[[bossnapping]]' by the mainstream media. In France during March 2009, [[3M]]'s national manager was locked in his office for 24 hours by employees in a dispute over redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7964122.stm |title=Striking French workers free boss |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6031822.ece |title=Angry French workers turn to 'Bossnapping' to solve their problems |publisher= |date=2009-04-04 |accessdate=2009-09-19 | work=The Times | location=London | first=Adam | last=Sage}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matlack |first=Carol |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/blog/europeinsight/archives/2009/04/sarkozys_bossna.html |title=BusinessWeek Europe

It is also caused by disagreement between employer and employees in a certain department.
==Examples==
=== Ireland ===

The [[Dublin Lockout]] ({{lang-ga|FrithdhÃºnadh MÃ³r Bhaile-Ãtha-Cliath}}) was a major [[industrial dispute]] between approximately 20,000 workers and 300 employers which took place in [[Ireland]]'s capital city of [[Dublin]]. The dispute lasted from 26 August 1913 to 18 January 1914, and is often viewed as the most severe and significant industrial dispute in [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Central to the dispute was the workers' [[Labor rights|right to unionize]].

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], under [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[labor law]], an employer may hire only temporary replacements during a lockout. In a strike, unless it is an [[unfair labor practice]] (ULP) strike, an employer may legally hire permanent replacements. Also, in many U.S. states, employees who are locked out are eligible to receive [[unemployment benefits]], but are not eligible for such benefits during a strike.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

For the above reasons, many American employers have historically been reluctant to impose lockouts, instead attempting to provoke a strike. However, as American unions have increasingly begun to resort to slowdowns rather than strikes, lockouts have come &quot;back in fashion&quot; for many employers. Even as incidents of strikes are on the decline, incidents of lockouts are on the rise in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Recent notable lockout incidents have been reported in professional sports, notably involving the [[National Basketball Association]] in the [[1995 NBA lockout|1995 offseason]] and the [[1998â99 NBA lockout|1998â99]] and [[2011 NBA lockout|2011â12 seasons]], the [[National Hockey League]] in the [[1994â95 NHL lockout|1994â95]] and [[2004â05 NHL lockout|2004â05]] seasons, and the [[National Football League]] in the [[2011 NFL lockout|2011 offseason]]. In 2005, the NHL became the first major professional sports league in North America to cancel an entire season due to a lockout.

=== Australia ===
On 8 April 1998, major stevedoring company [[Patrick Corporation]] sought to restructure its operations for productivity reasons.  In an [[1998 Australian waterfront dispute|industrial watershed event]], it sacked all its workers and imposed a lockout on wharves around Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/cib/1997-98/98cib15.htm Steve O'Neill, &quot;Outline of the Waterfront Dispute&quot;, ''Current Issues Brief'', (Parliamentary Library), n15, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;  

On 29 October 2011, [[Qantas Airways]] declared a lockout of all domestic employees in the face of [[2011 Qantas trade union disputes|ongoing union industrial action]]. This cancelled all flights, grounding the entire fleet effective immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/latest/11051127/qantas-grounds-entire-fleet/ Qantas grounds entire fleet] - ABC/Yahoo News, 29 Oct 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
