'''nano''' is a [[text editor]] for [[Unix-like]] computing systems or operating environments using a command line interface. It emulates the  [[Pico (text editor)|Pico]] text editor, part of the [[Pine (e-mail client)|Pine]] email client, and also provides additional functionality.&lt;ref&gt;The nano FAQ: http://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.2/faq.html#1.3&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to Pico, nano is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). Released as [[free software]] by [[Chris Allegretta]] in 1999, today nano is part of the [[GNU project]]. 

==History==
nano was first created in 1999 with the name ''TIP'' (''This isn't Pico''), by [[Chris Allegretta]]. His motivation was to create a free software replacement for Pico, which was not distributed under a [[free software license]]. The name was changed to nano on January 10, 2000 to avoid a naming conflict with the existing Unix utility ''[[Tip (unix utility)|tip]]''. The name comes from the system of [[SI prefix]]es, in which [[nano-|nano]] is 1000 times larger than [[pico-|pico]]. In February 2001, nano became a part of the [[GNU Project]].

nano implements some features that Pico lacks, including colored text, [[regular expression]] search and replace, smooth scrolling, multiple buffers, rebindable key support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GNU nano 2.1.0|first=Chris|last=Allegretta|date=2008-03-18|work=Nano-devel mailing list|publisher=gnu.org|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/nano-devel/2008-03/msg00023.html|accessdate=2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (experimental) undoing and redoing of edit changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GNU nano 2.1.3|first=Chris|last=Allegretta|date=2008-08-04|work=Nano-devel mailing list|publisher=gnu.org|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/nano-devel/2008-08/msg00000.html|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 2003, Chris Allegretta officially handed the source code maintenance for nano to [[David Lawrence Ramsey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GNU nano 1.3 branch opened in CVS|first=Chris|last=Allegretta|date=2003-08-11|work=Nano-devel mailing list|publisher=gnu.org|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/nano-devel/2003-08/msg00016.html|accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, 2007, Ramsey stepped down as nano's maintainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stepping down as the nano maintainer...|first=David Lawrence|last=Ramsey|date=2007-12-20|work=Nano-devel mailing list|publisher=gnu.org|url=http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/nano-devel/2007-12/msg00020.html|accessdate=2007-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control keys==
nano, like Pico, is [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]-oriented, controlled with [[control key]]s. For example, Control-O saves the current file; Control-W goes to the search menu. nano puts a two-line &quot;shortcut bar&quot; at the bottom of the screen, listing many of the commands available in the current context. For a complete list, Control-G gets the help screen.

Unlike Pico, nano uses [[meta key]]s to toggle its behavior. For example, Meta-S toggles smooth scrolling mode on and off. Almost all features that can be selected from the [[command line]] can be dynamically toggled.

nano can also use pointer devices, such as a mouse, to activate functions that are on the shortcut bar, as well as position the cursor.
