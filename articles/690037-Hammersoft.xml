'''Rodney Agatupu Anoa'i''' (October 2, 1966 â October 23, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwedaily.com/rodney-anoai-yokozuna/ WWE Daily Â» Blog Archive Â» Rodney Anoaâi- Yokozuna]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. He was best known for his time with the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) where he wrestled under the [[ring name]] '''Yokozuna'''. The term ''[[Makuuchi#Yokozuna|yokozuna]]'' refers to the highest rank in professional [[sumo]] wrestling in Japan. Although the &quot;Yokozuna&quot; character was portrayed as a champion sumo wrestler, Anoa'i had never competed as an actual ''sumotori''. Though Yokozuna wrestled as a representative of Japan, he was of Samoan origin and was accordingly billed as hailing from [[Polynesia]] (although he was managed by [[Harry Fujiwara|Mr. Fuji]], who would follow Anoa'i to the ring with a wooden bucket of salt, and waving a [[Japanese flag]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/y/yokozuna.html|title=Yokozuna Bio|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the WWF, Anoa'i was a [[List of WWE Champions|two-time]] [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wwetitle&quot;/&gt; and [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|two-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|Tag Team Champion]] (with [[Owen Hart]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;worldtagteam&quot;/&gt; as well as the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (1993)|1993 Royal Rumble]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1993 Royal Rumble&quot;/&gt; Anoa'i was the first wrestler of Samoan descent to hold the WWF Championship as well as the first Royal Rumble winner to receive a world title shot at [[WrestleMania]], as a result of a direct stipulation.

Yokozuna was one of the heaviest wrestlers of all time. When he entered wrestling he weighed just under 500 pounds, Fueled by a continuous desire to become bigger and heavier, Yokozuna soon weighed over 600 pounds and removed the padding{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. His heaviest billed wrestling weight was 750 pounds, although it is believed he actually weighed somewhere close to 800 pounds and was still trying to increase his size.

==Career==
===American Wrestling Association (1984â1992)===
Anoa'i's career in professional wrestling began as he grew up in a family full of wrestlers. His uncles were the [[Wild Samoans]], [[Afa Anoa'i|Afa]] and [[Sika Anoa'i|Sika]], who trained him from an early age in the family business. Anoa'i took on the name of the '''Great Kokina''' while wrestling overseas in Japan. He also spent some time in Mexico learning the craft and gaining the experience necessary to be a star in the sport.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt; His first major exposure in the United States came in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) as '''Kokina Maximus'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/yokozuna.html|title=Yokozuna Bio|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Accelerator 3359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling as a [[Samoa]]n superstar, he was [[manager (professional wrestling)|managed]] by [[Adnan Al-Kaissie|Sheik Adnan El Kassey]]. His biggest achievement at that time was the [[kayfabe]] breaking of [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]]'s leg and ending his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/ggagne.html|title=Greg Gagne Bio|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Accelerator 3359}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he weighed less than {{convert|400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, which was lean in comparison to his weight later in life (during his WWF career, he weighed between {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and perhaps as much as {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} at his heaviest.  After his time with the WWF he wrestled in independent circuits, increasing his weight even more in the hopes of gaining another 200â300&amp;nbsp;lb and thus becoming the biggest wrestler ever).&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;/&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1992â1998)===
====Early push (1992â1993)====
In 1992, Anoa'i was contacted by [[Vince McMahon]] of the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) and was offered a new [[List of professional wrestling terms#G|gimmick]]: Yokozuna. Managed by [[Harry Fujiwara]] (Mr. Fuji), Yokozuna debuted on the October 31, 1992 edition of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' and was announced as a sumo wrestler competing under the Japanese flag.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt; He made his [[pay-per-view]] debut at [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]], [[List of professional wrestling terms#S|easily defeating]] the much smaller [[Mike Jones (wrestler)|Virgil]] with his huge weight advantage.&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1992/results/|title=Survivor Series 1992 official results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yokozuna's career soon took off, and he headed into 1993's [[Royal Rumble (1993)|Royal Rumble]], where he was billed as a potential favorite. He eliminated [[Randy Savage]] to win the Royal Rumble match,&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;/&gt; cementing his movement towards main event status.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WWEalumni&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/yokozuna/|title=Yokozuna's WWE Alumni Profile|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1993 Royal Rumble&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881161/mainevent/|title=1993 Royal Rumble match|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Yokozuna further solidified his status as a monstrous [[heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] by crushing the American hero [[Jim Duggan|&quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan]] with four [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Seated senton|Banzai Drops]], the fourth being with the American flag draped over Duggan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/93.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====WWF Champion (1993â1994)====
At [[WrestleMania IX]], Yokozuna faced off against [[Bret Hart]] for the [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]]. Hart had the match won with Yokozuna about to submit to the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]], when Mr. Fuji threw salt into the champion's face. Blinded, Hart was then pinned by Yokozuna, who won the WWF Championship in a major upset, officially becoming the seventeenth WWF Champion.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WrestleMania 9 - Yokozuna vs Hart/Hogan vs Yokozuna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm9/mainevent/|title=WrestleMania IX main event|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454133|title=Yokozuna's first WWE Championship reign|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he and Mr. Fuji celebrated, [[Hulk Hogan]] came to the ring to help Hart and was challenged by Mr Fuji to take on the champion for his newly won crown. After Fuji accidentally threw salt in Yokozuna's eyes, Hogan came through with the win and captured his fifth WWF title.

At [[King of the Ring#1993|King of the Ring 1993]], Yokozuna, whose weight had already increased from {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} to {{convert|580|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, challenged Hogan for the title. Once again, Hogan seemed to be in control, but the champion underestimated the deceitful tactics of Mr. Fuji. A &quot;[[Bruno Lauer|Japanese photographer]]&quot; posing as a member of the legitimate Japanese wrestling press and planted at ringside by the group, aimed his lens at Hogan and pressed a button, shooting a blast of fire into his face. This allowed Yokozuna to take Hogan out with a leg drop and reclaim the WWF Championship, after which Yokozuna proceeded to hit Hogan with the Banzai Drop in the corner.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/june/1993.htm|title=King of the Ring 1993 results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=p.w.w.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454129|title=Yokozuna's second WWE Championship reign|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Hogan left the WWF to pursue other interests (WCW), which left Yokozuna and Fuji to claim that they had ended &quot;Hulkamania&quot; (to wit, that would be Hogan's last appearance in the WWF for nine years). To celebrate, he held a &quot;[[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|Bodyslam]] Competition&quot; aboard the {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|6}}, a decommissioned [[aircraft carrier]], on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. Many wrestlers and athletes alike tried to slam Yokozuna, with no success. As Yokozuna thought that there would be no one left to challenge him, [[Lex Luger]] flew in by helicopter, stepped forward, and slammed him on the deck. It was claimed by announcer [[Bobby Heenan]] that the move pulled by Luger was a hip toss rather than a bodyslam as Yokozuna was running at Luger when he slammed him, but the slam was ruled legitimate. This made Luger the next major challenger to Yokozuna's title reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge - Luger vs Yokozuna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/yokozunaslam.html|title=Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]], Yokozuna and the newly-reborn patriot Luger fought it out for the WWF Championship. Luger took control late in the match, scoring on Yokozuna with a bodyslam and [[Professional wrestling attacks#Flying forearm smash|flying forearm]]. Luger had metal plates put into his arm following an injury from a motorcycle accident, making it a formidable weapon (it was stipulated that Luger had to wear a protective pad over it, but it was torn off in the course of the match) and Yokozuna was knocked out of the ring, unconscious, and lost via countout. The title did not change hands, but the match's result made it seem like Luger had a chance against his gigantic foe. The contract Luger had signed for the match, as orchestrated by Yokozuna's new spokesman and advisor [[Jim Cornette]], stated that if he did not win the championship, he would not get another shot at the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SummerSlam - Luger vs Yokozuna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam07/history/1993/mainevent/|title=SummerSlam 1993 main event|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Accelerator 3359 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071222073655/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam07/history/1993/mainevent/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yokozuna and Luger continued to feud until [[Survivor Series (1993)|Survivor Series]], where each chose a team of allies for an elimination match. The match was billed as an All-Americans (Lex Luger, The Undertaker and [[Steiner Brothers]]) vs. Foreign Fanatics (Yokozuna, [[Jacques Rougeau|Quebecer Jacques]], [[Ludvig Borga]] and [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]]) contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Survivor Series - All Americans vs Foreign Fanatics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1993/mainevent/|title=Survivor Series 1993 main event|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221165128/http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1993/mainevent/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yokozuna's next challenger was [[The Undertaker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WWEalumni&quot;/&gt; The two first squared off against each other as parts of their respective teams at Survivor Series. Prior to the match starting, the two stood nose-to-nose as a tease to the crowd as to the possibility of those two facing each other. The Undertaker, however, was not tagged into the match until after it was just him and Luger on the American Team. When the Undertaker entered, he beat down on Ludvig Borga but was knocked down by Yokozuna. Yokozuna then gave the Undertaker a Banzai Drop, but the Undertaker sat up when Yokozuna went for a second Banzai Drop. The two then brawled
outside, where Yokozuna seemed to be completely over-matched. They were both eliminated by double countout.&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Survivor Series - All Americans vs Foreign Fanatics&quot;/&gt;

Eventually, Yokozuna was forced to accept a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Casket match]] with the Undertaker. The match occurred at [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]], where all the odds looked to be in the Undertaker's favor. However, after a lengthy match, Mr. Fuji called out the troops, bringing a dozen heel wrestlers out to aid Yokozuna in attacking the Undertaker. After a lot of struggle (as well as damaging the Undertaker's &quot;magic&quot; urn), the group managed to shove the Undertaker into the casket, giving the win to Yokozuna. As they celebrated afterwards, however, a mysterious figure appeared on the [[JumboTron|Titantron]], looking like the Undertaker inside the casket. He opened his eyes and said the Undertaker would not rest in peace; he then disappeared in a smoke and light show, rising to the top of the Titantron and seemingly levitating all the way to the arena ceiling. He then vanished. This [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|storyline]] was used to allow the Undertaker to rest for several months to recover from lingering real-life injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811421/results/|title=Royal Rumble 1994 official results|accessdate=2008-01-12| publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1994 Royal Rumble match, the last two competitors, Lex Luger and Bret Hart, fought and eliminated each other simultaneously. Since the winner of the Royal Rumble was to become the number one contender to Yokozuna's title, it was decided that both wrestlers would get a shot at the title at [[WrestleMania X]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Royal Rumble - 1994 Royal Rumble match&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811421/mainevent/|title=1994 Royal Rumble match|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher= WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of winning a coin toss, Luger got to wrestle Yokozuna first at the event. The winner of that match would go on to face Bret Hart later in the evening with the title on the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;rugged&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=McAvennie|url= http://www.wwe.com/inside/listthis/ruggedroadstomania/roadstomania7|title=Dis-Owen-ed|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; To obviate the risk of outside interference, both title matches were scheduled to have special guest referees. [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]] was the special guest referee for the Luger/Yokozuna bout. Luger seemed to have the match well in hand and had knocked out Yokozuna with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Forearm smash|running forearm smash]] in the middle of the ring. He also knocked out Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette, who tried to enter the ring. However when Luger went for the pin, Perfect occupied himself with the unconscious Fuji and Cornette who were still lying on the ring apron. When Luger got angry and pushed Mr. Perfect, he was disqualified, thus making Yokozuna the first [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] champion to successfully defend the WWF Championship at a [[WrestleMania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;

Later in the night, Yokozuna defended the championship again, this time against the former champion Bret &quot;Hitman&quot; Hart, who had lost earlier in the night to his brother [[Owen Hart]]. For this match, [[Roddy Piper]] was the special referee. When Cornette tried to interfere to break a pinfall, Piper decked him. At the end of the match, Yokozuna seemed ready to hit his finishing maneuver, the Banzai Drop, when he lost his balance and took a fall from the ropes. Hart got the pinfall victory, finally taking the title away from the long-running champion who reigned for [[List of WWE Champions|280 days]].&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WrestleMania - Hart vs Yokozuna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm10/mainevent/|title=WrestleMania 10 main event|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards on television, Cornette would blame the fall on a concussion suffered from Luger's forearm plate.

====Tag team competition and The Undertaker's return (1994)====
Yokozuna began tagging briefly with [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]], another Mr. Fuji charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt; In May 1994, on a ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' episode, Yokozuna was challenged by [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] to an actual sumo match. On May 16, 1994, Earthquake beat Yokozuna in the only ([[List of professional wrestling terms#W|worked]]) sumo match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1994.html|title=Monday Night RAW results 1994|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; until [[WrestleMania 21]], between [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]] and an actual ''[[makuuchi|yokozuna]]'', [[Akebono TarÅ|Akebono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm21/results/|title=WrestleMania 21 official results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[King of the Ring (1994)|King of the Ring 1994]], Yokozuna and Crush failed to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] from [[The Headshrinkers]] ([[Samula Anoa'i|Samu]] and [[Solofa Fatu|Fatu]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/kingofthering94.html|title=King of the Ring 1994 results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yokozuna then had to deal with the &quot;rebirth&quot; of the Undertaker, who immediately came after the foe who had taken him out of action. The two met in another casket match at the [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]], this time with actor/karate expert [[Chuck Norris]] as the [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)#ringside enforcer|special enforcer]] to keep the other heel wrestlers away from ringside. Without their help (although [[Mike Rotunda|Irwin R. Schyster]] did successfully interfere on Yokozuna's behalf), Yokozuna could not win and eventually ended up locked inside the casket. Yokozuna continued to wrestle briefly before taking some time off to increase his already huge weight advantage. .&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Survivor Series - Undertaker vs Yokozuna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1994/mainevent/|title=Survivor Series 1994 main event|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071221153553/http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1994/mainevent/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Teaming with Owen Hart (1995)====
{{Main|Owen Hart and Yokozuna}}
In April 1995, [[Owen Hart]] began promising that he would have a great tag-team partner to face off against [[The Smoking Gunns]] ([[Monty Sopp|Billy]] and [[Mike Plotcheck|Bart]]) at [[WrestleMania XI]] for the WWF World Tag Team Championship. At the event, Yokozuna was revealed as his partner, and the team managed to defeat the Gunns and win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm11/results/|title=WrestleMania XI official results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212114|title=Owen Hart and Yokozuna's first World Tag Team Championship reign|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the match, Jim Cornette stated, &quot;[[Michael Jordan]]'s back and so is Yokozuna&quot; (a reference to Jordan's first [[Michael Jordan#&quot;I'm back&quot;: Return to the NBA|NBA return]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WWE WrestleMania XI (1995)|work=Amazon.com|url=http://www.amazon.com/WWE-WrestleMania-XI-Bam-Bigelow/dp/6305277001/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=video&amp;qid=1222581532&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two would remain a tough [[Owen Hart and Yokozuna|tag team]] for a few months, defending against teams like the [[Allied Powers (wrestling)|Allied Powers]] ([[Lex Luger]] and [[Davey Boy Smith]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse2.html|title=In Your House 2 results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Smoking Gunns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse1.html|title=In Your House 1 results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Still, by this point it was obvious that Yokozuna was no longer in fighting shape, though still trying to grow bigger, it was obvious that he had already gained too much weight (he was estimated to be at around {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}} at this point, although he was billed at {{convert|641|lb|kg|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;

At [[In Your House 3]] on September 24, 1995, Yokozuna teamed up with [[Davey Boy Smith]] to take on [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] (the back story being that Hart was with his wife as she gave birth to one of their children) with Diesel's WWF Championship, Shawn Michaels' [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] and Hart and Yokozuna's Tag Team Championship on the line. During the match, Hart came to the ring, only to be pinned by Diesel.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse3.html|title=In Your House 3 results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, due to protests from the team and the legal help of [[Clarence Mason]], [[Professional wrestling authority figures#President|President]] [[Gorilla Monsoon]] reluctantly returned the belts to Yokozuna and Hart, since Hart was not an official part of the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/30445413212123|title=Owen Hart and Yokozuna's second World Tag Team Championship reign|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their second reign was shorter, as the Smoking Gunns defeated them that night for the belts.&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/1995.html|title=Monday Night RAW results 1995|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Face Turn and Departure (1996â1998)====
Yokozuna had little continued success in 1996. He competed in the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|1996 Royal Rumble]] match, managing to eliminate [[Bob Backlund]], [[Nelson Frazier, Jr.|King Mabel]], and Swat Team member #2 before being tossed out by Shawn Michaels, the eventual winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811412/mainevent/|title=1996 Royal Rumble match|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cornette had tried to make peace between him and new acquisition [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], many observers felt Yokozuna was being relegated. After several run-ins, Yokozuna left Cornette and began a short stint as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]]. He spoke English to the fans, had Mr. Fuji wave an American flag during his matches, and challenged Vader to numerous matches. It was during this feud that Yokozuna teamed up with [[Anthony Norris|Ahmed Johnson]] and [[Jake Roberts]] in a six-man tag-team match at [[WrestleMania XII]], facing off with Vader, Owen Hart and British Bulldog. The feud took a painful turn a couple weeks later, when Vader jumped on Yokozuna's leg,  breaking it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm12/results|title=WrestleMania XII official results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; A forklift had to come down to ringside to lift Yokozuna out, showing how his enormous size and his desire to gain even more weight had gotten out of control. He took some time off to begrudgingly slim down.

Yokozuna returned at [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog]] to wrestle Vader. During the event, a severe thunderstorm in the area caused the pay-per-view broadcast feed to black out. In one of the matches not broadcast, Yokozuna defeated Vader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1990s.html#8-A|title=WWF Beware of Dog results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was rescheduled two days later, in which the matches that were previously blacked-out took place again. In the rematch, Vader defeated Yokozuna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/miscppvs1990s.html#8-B|title=WWF Beware of Dog 2 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared at ''[[WWE Free for All|Free for All]]'' just before [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]], facing off against [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/summerslam96.html|title=SummerSlam 1996 results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yokozuna took the advantage near the end of the match, but when he went for the Banzai Drop, the rope broke, sending him crashing back down. Austin attained the victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;

The next night on ''Raw'', Yokozuna faced [[Shawn Michaels]] for the WWF Championship. Despite using his big size, Yokozuna lost the match to Michaels.&lt;ref name=&quot;RAW - HBK vs Yokozuna&quot;&gt;[http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/shawnmichaels/overcomingtheodds/raw96matchrecap/ August 19, 1996 RAW - Shawn Michaels vs. Yokozuna].

Retrieved on 2008-04-19&lt;/ref&gt; He would appear at one more WWF pay-per-view, still going after [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|1996 Survivor Series]], but that match ended with all remaining wrestlers being disqualified.&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1996/results/|title=Survivor Series 1996 official results|accessdate=2008-01-12|publisher=WWE |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211021831/http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1996/results/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yokozuna stayed on the WWF roster for a while afterwards, as he slowly worked to lose the weight that he had put on. Despite dropping a reported {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, he still could not lose enough to satisfy the WWF officials. He was unable to pass a physical required for professional wrestlers by the New York State Athletic Commission and was eventually released from the WWF in 1998, although rumors persisted that he would be brought back if he lost enough weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;acceleratorbio&quot;/&gt;

===Independent circuit (1999â2000)===
After his WWF career ended, he performed for various [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]]. The last major appearance for Yokozuna was at October 1999's [[Heroes of Wrestling]] pay-per-view, where he looked enormously overweight compared to his WWF days. At an estimated 760 pounds, he had not only gained the weight that he had lost but admitted he was intentionally getting bigger with a goal weight between 850 and 900 pounds.  At the pay-per-view event, Yokozuna was scheduled to take on [[King Kong Bundy]] in one of the event's two featured matches. However, this was not to be as [[Jake Roberts]], who was scheduled to face [[Jim Neidhart]] in the other main event match, came to the ring for his match intoxicated and in no condition to wrestle. The promoters made a last minute change and ordered Yokozuna to team with Roberts against Bundy and Neidhart, and Yokozuna's team lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;OWW&quot;/&gt;
