'''''Atlantis Mystery''''' ('''''l'Ãnigme de l'Atlantide''''') by the Belgian artist [[Edgar Pierre Jacobs|Edgar P. Jacobs]] was the seventh comic book in the [[Blake and Mortimer]] series, first published in [[Tintin (magazine)|Tintin Magazine]] from March 30, 1955 to May 30, 1956. It appeared in book format in 1957.

==Plot==
During a speleological expedition deep in the caves of the [[Azores]], Blake and Mortimer are cut off by their old enemy Olrik, trapping them in a gaseous cavern. Surviving the odds, they are captured by a race of technologically advanced men ... who claim to be descendants of survivors from [[Atlantis]]! Then, immersed in a sinister plot led by Commander Magon to topple the wise Basileus and lead modern Atlantis in conquest of the surface world, they ally themselves with Crown Prince Ikaros to thwart Magon's megalomaniac plans. But the outcome is far from certain...

==English Publication==
''Atlantis Mystery'' was published in English in 1990 by [[Catalan Communications|Comcat Comics]]. It was translated by Dwight Decker, and edited by Bernd Metz and Jean-Jacques Surbeck.

It will be later re-issued by [[Cinebook Ltd]] in January 2012.
