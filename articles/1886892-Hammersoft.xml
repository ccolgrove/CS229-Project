'''''Warriors''''' is a series of children's [[fiction]] novels published by [[HarperCollins]] and written by [[Erin Hunter]], a [[pseudonym]] used by authors [[Kate Cary]], [[Cherith Baldry]], and [[Tui Sutherland]]; the plot is developed by editor [[Victoria Holmes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FourthChat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/2998|title=Erin Hunter Chat #4 Transcript&amp;nbsp;â January 19, 2008|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series follows the adventures of four Clans of wild cats in their forest homes. The four Clans are [[List of ThunderClan cats|ThunderClan]], [[List of WindClan cats|WindClan]], [[List of ShadowClan cats|ShadowClan]] and [[List of RiverClan cats|RiverClan]]. SkyClan, the long-forgotten fifth Clan of the forest, is later introduced in the stand-alone novel ''Firestar's Quest''. The novel ''SkyClan's Destiny'' continues their adventure.
There are currently four series, each containing six books. The first, ''Warriors'' (often called &quot;Original Series&quot; and &quot;The First Arc&quot; to differentiate it from the later series), was published from 2003 to 2004. ''Warriors: The New Prophecy'', published from 2005 to 2006, followed the first series, chronicling the Clans as they move to a new home. The third story arc, ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was published from 2007 to 2009. The current series, ''Warriors: Omen of the Stars'', began with ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'', which was released on November 24, 2009, and continues where the third series left off. A fifth series has been requested by HarperCollins.&lt;ref name=fifthseries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/9636|publisher=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=May 23, 2011|title=Wands and Worlds Forum post|quote=hi blogclan! i just received an email from vicky saying that harpercollins wants a fifth series of warriors. yay! i canât tell you any more than that yet.}}The original blog post appears to have been taken down&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that it will be about the early Clans. Major themes in the series include forbidden love, nature versus nurture, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and characters being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[J. K. Rowling]], and [[William Shakespeare]].

Other books have been released in addition to the main series, including four lengthier individual books entitled ''[[Firestar's Quest]]'', ''[[Bluestar's Prophecy]]'', ''[[SkyClan's Destiny]]'' and ''[[Crookedstar's Promise]]''. Four field guides and several volumes of [[original English-language manga]], produced as a collaboration between HarperCollins and [[TOKYOPOP]], have been published as well. In addition to the books, the authors have also written two short stories and two plays. The Warriors series, with the exception of the manga, has been released in an e-book format for popular e-readers such as the [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]] and [[Amazon Kindle]]. The series has also been translated into several languages. In addition, the series has a website, which features games, promotional videos, quizzes, a message board, and news.

''Warriors'' has received mostly positive reviews, but has also been criticized for having a confusingly large number of characters. Critics have compared it to the [[Redwall]] series, though commenting that the series is less elegantly written. Although nominated for several awards, ''Warriors'' has yet to receive any major literary prizes. The series has also reached the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]], and has found popularity in places such as [[Trinidad]] and [[China]].

==Setting and characters==
{{Main|List of Warriors characters}}
In the Warriors series, there are four Clans of cats that live in the forest: [[List of ThunderClan cats|ThunderClan]], [[List of RiverClan cats|RiverClan]], [[List of WindClan cats|WindClan]], and [[List of ShadowClan cats|ShadowClan]]. ''StarClan'' is a group made up of the Clans' spiritual ancestors who give guidance to the Clans. In the past, [[List of SkyClan cats|SkyClan]] was a fifth Clan that was driven out, as their territory was destroyed by humans building a town, but Firestar revives it in ''[[Firestar's Quest]]''. Each Clan lives in their own territory, which they defend and hunt in. Each Clan has their own prey and special skills which suit their territory's terrain. As well, [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] is a group of stray city cats; however, they are not considered to be a true Clan, as they do not believe in StarClan.&lt;ref name=codeoftheclans&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Code of the Clans]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|isbn=9780061660092|publisher=HarperCollins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After death, most of the spirits of Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan is said to be contained within and part of Silverpelt (the [[Milky Way]]), and each individual star represents a single dead warrior. Upon joining StarClan, the cats' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living (i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured, and wounds can be healed). StarClan warriors keep watch over the Clans, usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive. They provide guidance to the Clans, often through dreams and other signs or omens. Often, this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone/Moonpool. In an author chat, Hunter said that StarClan can &quot;just get glimpses of&quot; the future, which they occasionally pass on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Chat&quot; /&gt;

Cats who have caused great pain and suffering to others during their lives go to a place called The Place of No Stars, which is also known as the Dark Forest. The cats there are bloodthirsty for power, and will to anything to rise to the top. Cats known to walk the Dark Forest include Tigerstar, Thistleclaw, Hawkfrost, Brokenstar, Mudclaw, Darkstripe, Hawkheart, Shredtail, Snowtuft, Mapleshade, Sparrowfeather, Antpelt and Clawface. &lt;ref name=&quot;fadingechoesbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0061555121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clans' origin has been described in ''[[Secrets of the Clans]]''. It stated that there were originally many small groups of wild cats who lived in the forest. Without a code of honor to follow or ancestors to provide guidance, they constantly fought for food and territory. One night at Fourtrees, a large battle occurred and many cats died. The spirits of the cats killed in battle returned and told the remaining cats to &quot;unite or die.&quot; Thus, five cats, Thunder, River, Shadow, Wind, and Sky, came forward to become the leaders of the first Clans, ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, WindClan, and SkyClan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Secrets&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Secrets of the Clans|Warriors Field Guide: Secrets of the Clans]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-123903-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dead spirits became StarClan, and slowly, the code of honor that the cats follow was created (as described in ''[[Code of the Clans]]'').

Beyond the Clans' territories lies a mountain range, inhabited by the [[List of cats in the Tribe of Rushing Water|Tribe of Rushing Water]]. The Tribe is shown to be similar to the Clans, yet it follows a different set of ancestors: the ''Tribe of Endless Hunting''. The Tribe has a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe and acts as a medicine cat, the cave-guards defend the Tribe, and the prey-hunters hunt for the Tribe.&lt;ref name=moonrise&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]|last=Hunter|first=Erin|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-074452-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clan hierarchy===
The Clans have a hierarchical system, with different types of cats doing different jobs within the Clan. The leader receives his or her nine lives and name from StarClan. A leader conducts important ceremonies, such as promoting warriors and making kits into apprentices. The leader's name ends with the suffix -star. A deputy is second-in-command, and succeeds the leader when he or she dies or retires to become an elder. The deputy's job is mainly organizing patrols and other everyday tasks. In order to be chosen as deputy, a cat must already be a warrior, and have mentored at least one apprentice. The exception to this rule is if a medicine cat receives a prophecy and the cat depicted has not mentored an apprentice, like in the case of Brambleclaw or Crookedjaw who in ''Crookedstar's Promise'', did not finish mentoring Sedgepaw. There is also a medicine cat in each Clan, who is in charge of receiving messages from StarClan and using herbs to heal sick or injured cats. Medicine cats are not allowed to have kits or mates, as it is said that it would distract them from their duties. At the half-moon, the medicine cats from each Clan meet at the Moonstone or Moonpool to talk with StarClan. A medicine cat apprentice helps gather herbs and learns medicinal knowledge, but is still considered an apprentice until the current medicine cat dies; however, they will usually have received their full name before that. There are also regular warrior apprentices who train to hunt for and defend their Clan. These apprentices are mentored by warriors who pass down knowledge and skills they have learned from their own mentors. Apprenticeships usually last approximately six moons (months). The warriors and apprentices are the only ones, besides the leader and deputy, who fight for the Clan. Warrior name suffixes (e.g. -claw, -heart, -pelt, -fur, -flight -tail) are selected by the leader to represent the individual cat's strengths. When a cat becomes old, or, in some cases, injured severely and permanently, he/she retires to become an elder. However, most cats die in battles or accidents, so few cats make it to this position. Elders share their knowledge to the Clan and are cared for by the apprentices. The only task they carry out is burying dead Clanmates. Clans also have queens, who are she-cats expecting or caring for their kits, but return to warrior duties when not expecting or nursing kits. A queen is not obligated to reveal the identity of her kits' father. The name of a kit is decided by the mother, occasionally the father, and has something to do with their appearance, or in some cases, something special to the namer of the cat (e.g. Brokenkit broke Yellowfang's heart). A kit's name always ends with the suffix -kit. Kits become apprentices when they are six moons old. All apprentices' names end with the suffix {{nobreak|-paw}}.

===Clan terminology===
The cats use their own terms to describe certain things. Examples of this are the terms &quot;twoleg&quot; (person), &quot;horseplace&quot; (a stable), &quot;halfbridge&quot; (a dock), crowfood (rotten prey), and fresh-kill (prey killed recently). The cats also use more practical ways of measuring time and distance: sunhigh and moonhigh are noon and midnight, respectively. A moon is a used to indicate a month (but really indicates a [[lunar month]]). The seasons have their own names as well, with newleaf being spring, greenleaf being summer, leaf-fall being autumn, and leaf-bare being winter. Distance terms vary, from a kittenstep to a tree-length, but the most common examples are fox-length, tail-length, and occasionally mouse-length. Insults, exclamations, and phrases are also used. &quot;Mouse-brain&quot;,&quot;snake-heart&quot; &quot;mouse dung&quot;, and &quot;fox dung&quot; are common expressions; &quot;mouse-brain&quot; is used as an insult, whereas &quot;mouse dung&quot; and &quot;fox dung&quot; are exclamations, usually used in frustration and anger. There are other examples of common phrases: a &quot;mouse-hearted&quot; cat is cowardly, while a &quot;fox-hearted&quot; cat is cruel or cunning. &quot;Great StarClan&quot;, and &quot;What in StarClan's name?&quot; are used as exclamations of surprise and shock. &quot;Thank StarClan!&quot; is used as an exclamation of gratitude.

==Main series==
===''Warriors'' (original series)===
The original series, released from 2003 to 2004, consists of six books: ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'', ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'', ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'', ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'', ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'', and ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. The series follows a pet kitten, or &quot;kittypet&quot;, named [[List of ThunderClan cats#Firestar|Rusty]] who has had dreams about the forest that lies beyond the neighborhood he lives in. He discovers the dreams are from StarClan, the spirits of the ancestors of the wild cats in the forest. One day, he ventures into the forest and is invited to join ThunderClan, one of the four groups of wild cats living in the forest. He accepts the invitation, and receives the name Firepaw. Later, Firepaw receives his warrior name, Fireheart, and discovers that [[List of ThunderClan cats#Tigerstar|Tigerclaw]], the deputy of ThunderClan, wishes to kill Bluestar in order to succeed her and become leader himself. 

In the third book, ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'', Fireheart becomes deputy of the Clan after Tigerclaw tries to kill Bluestar and fails: he is banished from the Clan. [[List of ThunderClan cats#Bluestar|Bluestar]] eventually dies in ''A Dangerous Path'', sacrificing her life to protect the Clan from dogs sent by Tigerstar, who is now the leader of ShadowClan. Fireheart then becomes the leader, receiving his nine lives and new name, Firestar.

Tigerstar then, in ''The Darkest Hour'', attempts to take over all four Clans, telling them that the leaders will rule together. Leopardstar, leader of RiverClan, agrees, but Firestar and Tallstar, the leader of WindClan, refuse. Tigerstar then tries to use [[List of Warriors characters#BloodClan|BloodClan]] to take over the Clans, but [[List of Warriors characters#Scourge|Scourge]] kills Tigerstar and decides to take over the forest for himself. The four Clans unite, and fight against BloodClan. Firestar kills Scourge during battle, thus defeating BloodClan and saving the forest.

===''Warriors: The New Prophecy''===
The second series, ''Warriors: The New Prophecy'',  was released from 2005 to 2006, and contains six books: ''[[Midnight (Warriors)|Midnight]]'', ''[[Moonrise (Warriors)|Moonrise]]'', ''[[Dawn (Warriors)|Dawn]]'', ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'', ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', and ''[[Sunset (Warriors)|Sunset]]''. This plot follows six cats: [[Brambleclaw]], [[List of ShadowClan cats#Tawnypelt|Tawnypelt]], [[List of WindClan cats#Crowfeather|Crowpaw]] (later Crowfeather), and [[List of RiverClan cats#Feathertail|Feathertail]], who are sent on a mission by StarClan to the ''sun-drown place'' (ocean), with Feathertail's brother, [[List of RiverClan cats#Stormfur|Stormfur]] and a ThunderClan apprentice, [[List of ThunderClan cats#Squirrelflight|Squirrelpaw]] (later Squirrelflight),  accompanying them. There, a badger named [[List of Warriors characters outside Clans#Midnight|Midnight]] tells the six cats that Twolegs (humans) will be making a Thunderpath (a road) that cuts across the Clans' territories, forcing the Clans to leave.

On the way back to the forest, the traveling cats meets a group of cats called the [[List of Warriors characters#The Tribe of Rushing Water|Tribe of Rushing Water]], who are being terrorized by a mountain lion called [[List of Warriors characters outside Clans#Sharptooth|Sharptooth]]. The Clan cats stay with the Tribe, but later run away. However, they then go back to help defeat Sharptooth. After luring Sharptooth into the cave where the Tribe lives, the cats attempt to fight him off. Feathertail jumps onto a rock spike on the roof of the cave and plummets to the floor with it, falling on Sharptooth and crushing him, sacrificing her life to save the Tribe.

In ''[[Starlight (Warriors)|Starlight]]'' and ''[[Twilight (Warriors)|Twilight]]'', [[List of ThunderClan cats#Leafpool|Leafpool]] and Crowfeather fall in love with each other. Crowfeather admits to Leafpool that he loves her when he saves her from falling off a cliff, in a situation similar to Feathertail's death. However, the warrior code says that she as a medicine cat cannot have a mate. They eventually abscond, but return because Midnight warns them that badgers are attacking ThunderClan. Upon returning, they find that a badger has killed Cinderpelt, the ThunderClan medicine cat, while she was helping [[List of ThunderClan cats#Sorreltail|Sorreltail]] give birth. This event reminds Crowfeather and Leafpool that they need to be with their Clans.

The series then centers around the prophecy &quot;before there is peace, blood will spill blood, and the lake will run red&quot;. Hawkfrost and Brambleclaw have been meeting with their father Tigerstar in dreams, in which he is teaching them how to become Clan leader.  Hawkfrost follows Tigerstar every step of the way, but Brambleclaw is split between loyalty to his leader, and his own ambition. Firestar appoints Brambleclaw deputy after finally accepting the possibility that Graystripe might never return. The series reaches its climax when Hawkfrost traps Firestar, and tells Brambleclaw to kill him. Brambleclaw decides that he does not want to become leader by force, and refuses to kill Firestar; instead, he frees him. Hawkfrost attacks Brambleclaw, but Brambleclaw kills Hawkfrost with the stick he used to free Firestar.

===''Warriors: Power of Three''===
[[File:PowerofThreebox.jpg|thumb|175px|The boxed set cover for ''Power of Three'']]
The third series, titled ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was released from 2007 to 2009, and includes: ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'', ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'', ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'', ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'', ''[[Long Shadows (Warriors)|Long Shadows]]'', and ''[[Sunrise (Warriors)|Sunrise]]''. The plot focuses on the prophecy, &quot;there will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws&quot;. The series follows three young cats named [[List of ThunderClan cats#Hollyleaf|Hollyleaf]], [[List of ThunderClan cats#Jayfeather|Jayfeather]], and [[List of ThunderClan cats#Lionblaze|Lionblaze]] who are Firestar's grandkits which makes them the cats of the prophecy. Jayfeather is blind, but soon discovers he has a unique power, as does one of his siblings.  Jayfeather has the power to feel emotions and memories coming off of other cats and walk in their dreams, where he is then able to see.  Lionblaze has the power to never get hurt in a fight. Hollyleaf does not have  powers, as she is later revealed not to be the third cat foretold in the prophecy.

In ''Dark River'' the siblings search for missing WindClan kits with help from two WindClan apprentices, Breezepaw and Heatherpaw. While searching, the tunnels flood, almost killing them, however, everyone eventually gets out safely. In ''Outcast'', two cats from the Tribe request help to drive away a group of loners that are stealing prey from the Tribe. The Clans send a patrol to help. There, Jayfeather learns that the Tribe came from the lake, and tells his siblings about the prophecy.

In ''Eclipse'', a loner cat called [[List of Warriors characters outside Clans#Sol|Sol]] warns Jayfeather and Leafpool that the sun will disappear. During a battle involving all four Clans, the sun disappears in an [[eclipse]]. Sol then persuades ShadowClan to lose faith in StarClan in ''Long Shadows''. Jayfeather, Lionblaze and Hollyleaf fake a sign from StarClan to convince [[List of ShadowClan cats#Blackstar|Blackstar]] that StarClan is real and should be followed. Sol is banished and apparently disappears.

Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze learn in ''Sunrise'' that their true parents are Leafpool and Crowfeather, not Squirrelflight and Brambleclaw. During a Gathering, Hollyleaf reveals this to all the Clans, and then runs away into the tunnels because she could not stand the fact that her birth was against the warrior code, which meant a lot to her. The tunnels then collapsed on Hollyleaf which trapped and/or killed her. The book ends with Jayfeather realizing that Hollyleaf was never meant to be part of the Three, and that either [[List of ThunderClan cats#Dovepaw|Dovekit]] or [[List of ThunderClan cats#Ivypaw|Ivykit]], grandkits of Firestar's nephew, Cloudtail, is meant to be the third cat of the prophecy.

===''Warriors: Omen of the Stars''===

The fourth series is titled ''Warriors: Omen of the Stars'', and is a direct continuation of the previous series.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifthchat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|title=Erin Hunter chat #5 transcript&amp;nbsp;â August 16, 2008|work=Wands And Worlds|accessdate=August 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the three series before, this series will have six books. The first five books have been published, entitled ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'', ''[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]'', ''[[Night Whispers (Warriors)|Night Whispers]]'', ''[[Sign of the Moon]]'', and [[The Forgotten Warrior]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SeventhChat&quot;/&gt; The sixth and final book is titled the ''The Last Hope''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kc-blog-lasthope&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Cary|first=Kate|title=Kate Cary&amp;#039;s Blog  Â» Blog Archive   Â» OOTS6 The Final Hope (I mean LAST Hope!)|url=http://katecary.co.uk/blog/?p=1565|accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ''[[The Fourth Apprentice (Warriors)|The Fourth Apprentice]]'', Dovepaw finds out that she has a special power, which is to hear and see things that nobody else can. Dovepaw sees beavers building a beaver dam that is blocking the river upstream far away, causing the lake to dry up. When Dovepaw reveals this, Jayfeather and Lionblaze both realize that she is the third cat in the prophecy, as the beavers were in fact very far away. Firestar is told of Dovepaw's beaver idea, and he announces it at the Gathering (while not revealing that it was Dovepaw's idea). After a discussing it with the three other leaders, they decide to send a patrol with two cats from each Clan. The patrolÂ goes upstream in an effort to restore the river flow and end the drought. While they are away Jayfeather is attacked at the Moonpool by Breezepelt of WindClan and a Dark Forest cat. He is rescued by Honeyfern (a StarClan warrior) who fights them off. Rippletail is killed when a beaver rips his shoulder during an attempted battle to kill them and destroy the dam. Lionblaze and Dovepaw recruit three kittypets to help destroy the dam. Just before the beavers return, and the dam is about to collapse, the water floods and destroys it. When Lionblaze and Dovepaw have returned, Poppyfrost gives birth to Molekit and Cherrykit. Jayfeather then tells Lionblaze that the Dark Forest is rising and Lionblaze confesses to once being trained by Tigerstar. Jayfeather then realises the Dark Forest is training cats to fight.

In ''[[Fading Echoes (Warriors)|Fading Echoes]]'', Hawkfrost visits Ivypaw in a dream, pretending to be her friend. Jayfeather goes to the Dark Forest with Yellowfang and Spottedleaf, and discovers that the Dark Forest cats are doing battle training. Firestar admits to the three that he knows about the prophecy and is surprised to find they already knew. Ivypaw becomes envious of the attention that Dovepaw is receiving, and demands to know why she is hanging out with the older warriors and visiting Firestar often lately. Later on, a tree falls on the camp and ThunderClan manages to evacuate in time, thanks to Dovepaw's far-reaching senses. However, Longtail ends up dying. Briarlight goes after him and her backbone is broken, causing her to lose the ability to move her hind legs. The book ends in a battle between ShadowClan and ThunderClan, after Ivypaw claimed to receive a sign from StarClan (Hawkfrost). Russetfur, ShadowClan's deputy,  is killed and Firestar loses a life. After the battle, Lionblaze and Jayfeather are sure that the battle should not have happened and suspect the Dark Forest caused it.

''[[Night Whispers (Warriors)|Night Whispers]]'' begins as StarClan are arguing about the battle with ThunderClan and ShadowClan. The book then continues with ShadowClan and ThunderClan going home after the battle. Lionblaze is guilty that he killed Russetfur trying to save Firestar. Further on, Ivypaw continues to meet with the Dark Forest in her dreams and eventually Jayfeather finds out. After he found out, he tells Lionblaze. Dovepaw overhears this. She confronts Lionblaze and Jayfeather and demands that they ask Ivypaw to stop, however Jayfeather thinks they should use Ivypaw to learn about how the Dark Forest warriors are training their recruits. Dovepaw gets angry when she hears this. Meanwhile, Lionblaze and Cinderheart are in love with each other. Later on, Dovepaw and Tigerheart fall in love and start meeting each other every night. Meanwhile, Dovepaw tries to convince Ivypaw not to go to the Dark Forest, but the young she-cat is as oblivious as ever to the dangers. Later on, Dovepaw's extreme senses let her patrol know that the camp is being attacked by a fox. No cat is badly injured, but Lionblaze begs Firestar to let him drive off the fox. Lionblaze manages to drive off the fox and with no injuries. Cinderheart is told about Lioblaze's prophecy, and becomes convinced Lionblaze is too good for her. Meanwhile, Ivypaw thinks that maybe the Dark Forest is a bit dangerous. When Dovepaw goes to meet Tigerheart one night, Ivypaw follows her sister. She confronts Dovepaw and Tigerheart, and when she failed to win over Dovepaw, she tried to convince her to stop seeing Tigerheart by telling Dovepaw that he was training in the Dark Forest as well. Dovepaw refuses to believe Ivypaw. They are interrupted by a ShadowClan patrol. Tigerheart shoves Dovepaw under some bracken, but Ivypaw got captured by the patrol. Ivypaw is later exchanged for catmint that Littlecloud, the medicine cat, needs. Dovepaw believes that Tigerheart used her on purpose to find the location of the herbs, and thinks that he never loved her. Ivypaw is getting nervous now as she goes into the Dark Forest, then finds out the truth: that Tigerstar is training her and the others to fight the Clans. She agrees to spy on the Dark Forest for Jayfeather, Lionblaze, and Dovepaw. In ShadowClan territory, the lake has frozen over and Flametail plays games with his Clanmates. Unfortunately, the ice breaks and he is thrust under the water. Jayfeather tries to save him, but Rock appears and tells him to let Flametail die. That same night, Ivypaw returns to the Dark Forest in her dreams. Brokenstar finds her and says he will &quot;test&quot; her loyalty to the Dark Forest. He leads her to a clearing in the Dark Forest, where a confused Flametail is standing. Brokenstar commands Ivypaw to kill Flametail. Ivypaw refuses to kill Flametail, so Brokenstar threatened to take Dovepaw's life if Ivypaw did not do as he said. Having no choice, Ivypaw leaps on Flametail, but is stopped by Tigerheart. Tigerstar joins in, praising Tigerheart for his bravery and adding that Flametail only knew how to mix herbs, so his presence did not bother him. The novel ends with Tigerstar telling his companions he is confident Ivypaw will fight for the Dark Forest when the time comes.

In ''[[The Sign of the Moon]]'', Ivypaw and Dovepaw get their warrior names of Ivypool and Dovewing. Jayfeather and Lionblaze find signs that indicate the possbility that Hollyleaf might not be dead, when a tunnel very close to the spot where rocks supposedly buried Hollyleaf (when Icecloud falls through the shallow roof of the tunnel) is discovered. At a Gathering, Dovewing searches for Tigerheart but denies loving him. Midway through the book, Jayfeather, Dovewing, Foxleap, and Squirrelflight visit the Tribe of Rushing Water when Jayfeather receives a dream from Rock, who insists he go to the mountains for a mysterious purpose. While there, Jayfeather is again sent into centuries before his own time, to convince the ancient Tribe ancestors to stay in the mountains, as they are weary and very close to returning to the lake (their previous home). Jayfeather (known as &quot;Jay's Wing&quot; in the ancient time he's visiting) succeeds in the mission Rock assigned him, and even completes the most important task of all: assigning the new Stoneteller of the Tribe in the ancient times, and in his own time. He appoints Half Moon as the Stoneteller of ancient times (who he has a brief relationship with, but as expected, it does not work out) and Crag Where Eagles Nest as the Stoneteller of modern times. While in his slight relationship with Half Moon, Jayfeather is tempted to never return to his own time and stay with her to become mates. Meanwhile Ivypool and Blossomfall go exploring in the cave (that Icecloud fell in) and get lost, but a mysterious cat leads them out after a scrawny ginger tom tells them to follow a path out. Meanwhile, Jayfeather is told a new prophecy: &quot;The end of the stars draws near, Three must become four, to battle the darkness that last forever.

''[[The Forgotten Warrior]]''  In the beginning, Sol, travels back to the lake. He is stopped by a kittypet who recognizes him as &quot;one of the cats on the lake&quot;. He ignores him, hoping not to pick a fight and moves on. Later, Jayfeather wakes up from his nightmare. He remembers when Lionblaze told him about how Briarlight sneaked out with Bumblestripe and was almost eaten by dogs. Lionblaze was there in time to save them without getting hurt. Briarlight tells Jayfeather how she found a tuft of black fur in the back of the herb store. Jayfeather recognizes it as Hollyleaf's. While Dovewing and Ivypool are on patrol, Dovewing fears that she lost her special talent. Ivypool notices how she is acting and asks her what is wrong. She comforts her sister and moves on. Birchfall reveals to Ivypool that he is training in the Dark Forest. Ivypool is horrified but keeps a straight face. On the way back, a WindClan patrol accuses them for washing their paws in the river. Sorreltail stops them before there is a fight. When chasing a squirrel, Dovewing almost passes the ShadowClan border. Tigerheart spots her and tells Dovewing that his sister Dawnpelt wants to take revenge on ThunderClan because she suspects that Jayfeather killed her brother Flametail. Later, Molekit and Cherrykit become apprentices. Sorreltail tells the Clan that she will be having kits. Dovewing confesses to Lionblaze that she is afraid that she had lost her powers. Lionblaze comforts her but he feels nervous. WindClan accuses ThunderClan of crossing the border. They deny it but WindClan is jumpy. Later, Molepaw and Cherrypaw enter camp with their mentors announcing that they were attacked by foxes. They tell them how a stranger scared the fox off before any serious injuries were inflicted. The rest of the Clan thinks that the new apprentices are making it up, but Jayfeather and Lionblaze thinks that it might be Hollyleaf. Lionblaze convinces Firestar to let him track down the stranger so he does. He discovers Sol and brings him back to camp. Bumblestripe falls in love with Dovewing and she realizes that she loves him back after a midnight walk. In Jayfeather's dream, Yellowfang tells him to tell Cinderheart about her past. He refuses but tells Cinderheart later anyway. While on a walk, Dovewing and Ivypool go into the tunnels underground. They hear Sol discussing an attack on ThunderClan with WindClan. They find Hollyleaf and she helps them get out. Lionblaze sees her and brings her back to the Clan. Hollyleaf reveals that she killed Ashfur with Brambleclaw's support. She also tells everyone that she saved the apprentices from the fox attack, not Sol. Everyone welcomes her except for only a few.  Sorreltail names her kits Lilykit and Seedkit. Cinderheart is now convinced that she should be a medicine cat. Yellowfang is mad at Jayfeather for telling Cinderheart her past, but Jayfeather tells her that it was not his idea. Hollyleaf begins tunnel training to help with the fight with WindClan. Ivypool is still visiting the Dark Forest at nights. When she tells Brokenstar that she wants to teach the cats, he tells her to kill Antpelt again. Ivypool wins and kills Antpelt. In the end, ThunderClan wins the battle with WindClan by pushing them into the tunnels.

''The Last Hope'' is due to be released on April 3, 2012. The cat on the cover is Firestar.&lt;ref name=lasthopeamazon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061555274|title=Amazon catalogue page: Warriors: Omen of the Stars 6|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other books==
===Super Editions===

'''Super Editions''' are  books in the ''Warriors'' series that are approximately double the length of a normal ''Warriors'' book. There are four Super Editions: [[Firestar's Quest]], [[Bluestar's Prophecy]], [[SkyClan's Destiny]] and [[Crookedstar's Promise]]. They are standalone stories and as the titles imply, the first features Firestar, the second features Bluestar, the third features the modern SkyClan a few months after [[Firestar's Quest]], and the fourth features Crookedstar, the leader of RiverClan.

=====''Firestar's Quest''=====

The book follows Firestar and Sandstorm, who go on a journey to restore [[List of Warriors characters#SkyClan|SkyClan]], the fifth Clan of the forest, that had been driven out when a Twolegplace (town) was built, and was scattered when it was attacked by rats in its new home.

It explains Bluestar's constant and unfailing trust of Whitestorm, her kits and secret mate, and tells about her struggle between her Clan and her heart. The book describes a prophecy given to Bluestar by her uncle, Goosefeather, the medicine cat at the time. However, Goosefeather eventually becomes insane, pushing Bluestar to follow the prophecy at all costs.

=====''SkyClan's Destiny''=====

The book takes place several months after ''Firestar's Quest''. After Firestar leaves, SkyClan prospers, but not without challenges. The Clan's members are split over whether or not &quot;daylight-warriors&quot;, kittypets that join the Clan in the day and return to their owners at night, should be allowed to be part of the Clan. As well, a group of visiting rogues create challenges for the Clan.

=====''Crookedstar's Promise''=====
''[[Crookedstar's Promise]]'' was released on July 5, 2011. It takes place during the same time as Bluestar's Prophecy and explains how Stormkit became Crookedkit. The book describes the promise that Crookedkit made to a Dark Forest cat, who he believed was a StarClan cat, named Mapleshade. She tells him that she can give him anything he wants, power over his Clanmates and the other Clans as long as he is faithful to his Clan and puts all other things aside. As a young warrior, Crookedjaw pledges his undying loyalty to RiverClan in exchange for the promise of power, not realizing that his pledge will haunt him when he becomes the leader of his Clan.

It was the result of a questionnaire on the official Warriors website, which had asked fans what they wanted to see in a new ''Warriors'' book. The story follows Scourge, the leader of BloodClan, one of the antagonists in ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]''. It centers around his early years, when he was bullied as a kit for being small. The book follows him until he kills Tigerstar, who had attacked Scourge when he ventured into the forest as a kitten.

==Inspiration and origins==
[[Image:Alder trees beaulieu river fawley ford.jpg|thumb|175px|[[New Forest]], which became the base for the forest the cats live in]]
The series first began when [[HarperCollins]] asked Vicky Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats. Initially, Holmes was not very enthusiastic, since she &quot;couldn't imagine coming up with enough ideas&quot;. She worked with the concept, however, expanding the storyline with elements of war, politics, revenge, doomed love, and religious conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Postchat6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-postchat|title=Transcript of Erin Hunter Post Chat 6|accessdate=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original plan was a stand-alone novel, enough material was created for several books, and the publisher decided upon a six volume series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Postchat6&quot;/&gt; The first volume, ''Into the Wild'', was written by Kate Cary, under the pseudonym &quot;Erin Hunter&quot;, and was completed in about three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstChat&quot;/&gt; Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details.&lt;ref name=&quot;Writers Unboxed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writerunboxed.com/2006/04/21/author-interview-erin-hunter/|title=INTERVIEW: Erin Hunter|work=Writers Unboxed|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cherith Baldry]] joined the Erins to write the third book, ''Forest of Secrets''.&lt;ref name=&quot;FourthChat&quot; /&gt;

The authors have named several other authors as sources of inspiration when writing the novels. In an online author chat, [[Cherith Baldry]] listed the authors that inspire her as including [[Tolkien]], [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], and [[Shakespeare]]. In the same chat, [[Victoria Holmes]] stated that [[Jacqueline Wilson]], [[Kathy Reichs]] and [[J. K. Rowling]] are some of the authors that inspire her.&lt;ref name=&quot;FourthChat&quot;/&gt; According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include [[Enid Blyton]], [[Lucy Daniels]], [[Ellis Peters]], [[Tess Gerritsen]], [[Kate Ellis]], Lisa Gardiner, [[Jaqueline Wilson]] and [[Meg Cabot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Warriors&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.warriorcats.com/warriorshell.html| title=Warriors| work=warriorcats.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The [[New Forest]] in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstChat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wandsandworlds.com/community/node/52|title=Transcript Of Erin Hunter Chat #1|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential locations include [[Loch Lomond]],&lt;ref name=katefaq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katecary.co.uk/blog/?page_id=760|title=Kate's Blog: FAQ|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Scottish Highlands]]. [[Nicholas Culpeper]], a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, has also had an influence on the ''Warriors'' series. His book, ''Culpeper's Herbal'', is used as a source by the authors for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the authors mentioned that they may use some fan-created names in future books.&lt;ref name=&quot;FourthChat&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SeventhChat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/9725|title=Erin Hunter Chat #7 Transcript&amp;nbsp;â part 1|work=Wands And Worlds|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also mentioned as a source of inspiration was [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SeventhChatP2&quot;/&gt;

==Critical reception==
The first book of the series, ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'', was generally well-received, with reviewers calling it a &quot;spine-tingling,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;booklist&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=February 15, 2003|title=Booklist review: Hunter, Erin.

[...] The supporting cast of players is large and a little confusing [...] This is not as elegantly written as Brian Jacques's &quot;Redwall&quot; series}}&lt;/ref&gt; but another criticised the characters and imagined world as being &quot;neither&amp;nbsp;... consistent nor compelling.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;del-negro&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Negro|first=Janice M.

The large number of characters involved in the series has often been seen as a negative point; though one reviewer compared the &quot;huge cast&quot; to that of a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek drama]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rawlins&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawlins|first=Sharon|date=October 1, 2003|title=School Library Journal review: Forest of Secrets|journal=[[School Library Journal]]|volume=49|issue=10|pages=167 |url=http://elibrary.bigchalk.com.ezproxy.torontopubliclibrary.ca/canada|accessdate=August 21, 2008|quote=This exciting book is not for the faint of heart as it is often violent [...] It is reminiscent of Greek drama, with its huge cast of characters}}&lt;/ref&gt; others wrote that it was &quot;hard to follow&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prolman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prolman|first=Lisa|date=September 1, 2003 |title=School Library Journal review: Fire and Ice|journal=[[School Library Journal]]|volume=49|issue=9|pages=214|url=http://elibrary.bigchalk.com.ezproxy.torontopubliclibrary.ca/canada|accessdate=August 21, 2008 |quote=Readers not familiar with the first book may find this one hard to follow.

As one reviewer put it, the cats in the series are &quot;true to their feline nature,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;booklist&quot;/&gt; leading some critics to jokingly comment that the books will &quot;leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kirkus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003 |month=January |title=Kirkus review: Into the Wild |journal=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=61 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.torontopubliclibrary.ca/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,cpid&amp;custid=noyork&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=8846573&amp;site=ehost-live |accessdate=August 21, 2008 |quote=Hunter debuts with a suspenseful animal adventure that will leave readers eyeing Puss a bit nervously. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[wonder] what dreams of grandeur may haunt the family cat.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;publishers-weekly&quot;/&gt; However, this realism also means that the series contains a relatively large amount of violence,&lt;ref name=&quot;alpert&quot;/&gt; with one critic stating that it is &quot;not for the faint of heart.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rawlins&quot;/&gt; Several critics have compared ''Warriors'' to [[Brian Jacques]]' [[Redwall]] series,&lt;ref name=&quot;booklist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;del-negro&quot;/&gt; though one commented that it was &quot;not as elegantly written.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alpert&quot;/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the series a &quot;hit with young readers,&quot; specifically because of its &quot;sprawling universe,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E5DE1E30F936A25752C0A9609C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |title=TBR: Inside the List |author=Dwight Garner |date=January 15, 2006 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |work=nytimes.com |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |quote=The ''Warriors'' books are a hit with young readers, in part, because of the sprawling universe they open up.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the series was able to stay on the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]] for 107 weeks, as of December 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2011-12-11/series-books/list.html|accessdate=December 4, 2011| work=The New York Times|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler|title=Childrens' Series Bestsellers: December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
A theme in the series is forbidden love, examples being Bluestar with Oakheart, Graystripe with Silverstream, Leafpool with Crowfeather, Yellowfang with Raggedstar, and Dovewing with Tigerheart. These loves were not allowed as some were with medicine cats while others were with cats in other Clans which are both against the Warrior Code, the code of honor the Clans must follow. Another theme featured in the novel is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. To show this, the Tribe of Rushing Water was introduced in ''Moonrise''. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water are right about faith, because both are &quot;equally valid.&quot; This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that &quot;ignorance is a very scary thing!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Chat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #2|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124|work=Wands and Worlds |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071010001755/wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124 |archivedate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-belief, such as where Mothwing or Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan, is also featured in the storyline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chat3part2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|title=Erin Hunter Chat #3 Transcript&amp;nbsp;â part 2|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Holmes said that another central theme of the series is &quot;faith and spirituality&quot; in StarClan.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifthchat&quot; /&gt; All books in the series heavily feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, but in terms of explicit prophecies for StarClan which inevitably come true.  A few scenes actually take place within StarClan itself, with no earthly cats present as point-of-view characters.  Thus, while the differences in belief is a clear minor theme, the existence of an afterlife and the influence of &quot;cat spirits&quot; who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series.

Another theme surfaces in how the books show characters that can be a mix of good and evil. Holmes has said she is fascinated by these &quot;shades of gray&quot; in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a relatively noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions. Similarly, Holmes has also compared the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil.&lt;ref name=&quot;FourthChat&quot; /&gt; A third major theme, often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]], relates to whether a person is born the way he or she will be, or if other things shape that, as in the example of Brambleclaw. This theme ties into the &quot;shades of gray&quot; theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Chat&quot; /&gt;

Publishers Weekly noted that friendship and responsibility were things that were taught to characters in the novels,&lt;ref name=&quot;publishers-weekly&quot;/&gt; while booksforyouths.com had a review which pointed out the idea that just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realise that it is necessary to experience hardships in life.&lt;ref name=booksforyouths&gt;{{cite web|url=http://booksforyouth.wordpress.com/2009/05/14/into-the-wild-warriors-book-1-by-erin-hunter/|title=booksforyouth Review|publisher=booksforyouth.com|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that &quot;it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fireandicereview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://storysnoops.com/detail.php?id=248|title=Storysnoops Review|publisher=storysnoops.com|accessdate=July 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Dawn'', the theme of cooperation is explored. The four Clans, normally hostile to each other, are forced to work together in order to find a new home.&lt;ref name=&quot;barnesnobledawn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?ean=9780060744571&amp;pwb=1&amp;z=y#TABS|title=Dawn (Warriors, Warriors: The New Prophecy Series, Erin Hunter, Book&amp;nbsp;â Barnes &amp; Noble|accessdate=January 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other themes that have been pointed out include family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Chat&quot;/&gt;

==Other media==
===Website===
The ''Warriors'' website features ''Warriors'' [[screen saver]]s, and E-cards, along with videos on &quot;How To Draw Graystripe,&quot; the process of writing a manga book, and a video to promoting ''Cats of the Clans''. There is also a &quot;How To Draw Manga&quot; page. In addition, there are games, including: quizzes, the ''New Prophecy Adventure'', the ''Warriors Hunting Game'', and the ''Warriors Adventure Game'', a paper-and-pencil-based role-playing game. On the Q&amp;A section of the site, Erin Hunter said that they are working on an online game that would be released in late 2010. It finished the first round of testing in summer 2010, but by January 2011, had not been released. Whether it will be a role-playing game is unknown. Erin Hunter has stated on the official Warriors website that there is still no plan for an official video game, but if there was, it would probably be based on a movie version of the Warriors series, which is currently not under consideration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warriors&quot;/&gt; Many fans have also created their own forum-based role-playing games&lt;!-- please do not advertise your own website here, thank you --&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second Chat&quot;/&gt;

===Movie===
&lt;!-- Please do not make claims that there will be a Warriors movie in this section without a reliable source. --&gt;
During a July 2009 author chat, Victoria Holmes stated that there are currently no planned ''Warriors'' movies, and none under consideration:
{{Quote|&quot;Oh, the fickle world of movie making, well, there are currently no ''Warriors'' movies in production or even under consideration. The economy is not in a state to invest in a rather dark animation about feral cats, apparently. I promise I'll let you know if there are any changes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SixthChat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-chat|title=Erin Hunter Chat #6 Transcript&amp;nbsp;â the chat|work=Wands And Worlds|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In August 2010, she stated:
{{Quote|&quot;Well, never say never, but there are currently no Warriors movies in production, and no immediate plans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SeventhChatP2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/9726|title=Erin Hunter Chat #7 Transcript&amp;nbsp;â part 2|work=Wands And Worlds|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Short stories===
The first short story written by Erin Hunter was called ''Spottedleaf's Honest Answer''. In it, Spottedleaf talks about her love for Firestar. It gives information on what happened in the ''Warriors'' series from ''Into the Wild'' to ''Firestar's Quest''.&lt;ref name=&quot;spottedleaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorswish.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62:spottedleafshonestanswer&amp;catid=35:essaysandarticles|title=Spottedleaf's Honest Answer |last=Hunter|first=Erin|accessdate=April 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2009, another short story, called ''The Clans Decide'', was released on the ''Warriors Ultimate Leader Election'' site, starring Firestar, who won an election through an online vote conducted in recognition of President Obama's Inauguration Day. The story is about the four Clans voting for a way to survive a tough leaf-bare (winter). Every cat at the meeting voted whether or not the Clans would work together to survive the leaf-bare. In the end, the Clans decided to work together to survive leaf-bare.&lt;ref name=election&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorcats.com/data/downloads/electionstory.pdf|title=The Clans Decide|last=Hunter|first=Erin|accessdate=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
Written by Victoria Holmes for a tour, a play entitled ''After Sunset: We Need to Talk'' was first premiered on April 28, 2007, at the Secret Garden bookstore in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. It details a meeting between Leafpool of ThunderClan and Crowfeather of WindClan after the events of ''Sunset''. The script was released to the public at the official site for the ''Warriors'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;firstplay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorcats.com/data/downloads/we_need_to_talk.pdf|title=After Sunset: We Need to Talk|last=Hunter|first=Erin|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a fund raising event in [[Russellville, Arkansas]], ''Brightspirit's Mercy'' was performed by various high school drama students. The second of the two plays by Erin Hunter, ''Brightspirt's Mercy'' is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit, and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on ''Wands and Worlds'', a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old ''Warriors'' fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, who were killed in a tornado in February 2007.&lt;ref name=brightspirit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightspiritrelieffund.com|title=Brightspirit Relief Fund|work=IMC studios}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. [[List of WindClan cats#Ashfoot|Ashfoot]], WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;secondplay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorcats.com/data/downloads/brightspirit.pdf|title=Brightspirit's Mercy|last=Hunter|first=Erin|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trading cards===

In the Chinese translation of the series, &quot;3-D trading cards&quot; are packaged in each book. The 3-D effect is caused by [[Lenticular printing#Types of lenticular prints|stereoscopic lenticular printing]]. These cards feature pictures of the cats on the center of the bookcover with the Chinese and English names, and biographical information on the back. Current cards feature Firestar, Bluestar, Tallstar, Graystripe, Tigerstar, a collage of the 5 previous cats, Brambleclaw, Feathertail, Leafpool, Onestar, Crowfeather, Hawkfrost, Hollyleaf, Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Blackstar, Squirrelflight, Breezepelt, Sandstorm, Oakheart, Dovewing, Ivypool and Flametail.&lt;ref name=&quot;morningstarsunrise&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morningstar.com.tw/bookcomment-2.aspx?BOKNO=0151018|title=Morningstar Online Catalog Page: Warriors: Sunrise|work=Morningstar.com.tw|language=Chinese|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
