}}The '''2011 Super League season''' (known as the '''Engage Super League XVI''' for sponsorship reasons) was the sixteenth season of [[rugby league football]] since the [[Super League]] format was introduced in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engagesl.com/pressreleases/jul08-deal.php|title=engage extends Super League deal|publisher=''engagesl.com'' (Engage Mutual Assurance)|accessdate=2009-04-20|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourteen teams competed for the [[League Leader's Shield]] over 27 rounds (including the [[Magic Weekend]] at [[Millennium Stadium]]), after which the highest finishing teams entered the play-offs to compete for a place in the Grand Final and a chance to win the championship and the Super League Trophy. [[Leeds Rhinos]] claimed their fifth Super League crown, tying the record previously held by [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]], whilst [[Warrington Wolves]] lifted the League Leader's Shield.

The season kicked off on 12 February with the Annual &quot;Millennium Magic Weekend&quot;, which was brought forward from its usual slot in May. All clubs also participated in the [[2011 Challenge Cup]] tournament.

The first game of the new season was Warrington Wolves vs [[Huddersfield Giants]], a repeat of the [[2009 Challenge Cup Final]] and a repeat of the classic play-off match between the two sides. Former Giants captain and Warrington Full Back [[Brett Hodgson]] made his debut for his new club against his old one.

The 2011 season included the introduction of the [[Rugby League International Origin Match]], wherein the [[England national rugby league team]] played the RL Exiles, an outfit made up of Australians and New Zealanders playing for Super League clubs. This contest is intended to henceforth become an annual fixture to replace the previously existing annual test against the [[French national rugby league team]], due to the onesidedness of such contests in recent years.

==Teams==
Super League XVI was the third year of a [[2009â11 Super League licences|licenced Super League]]. Under this system, promotion and relegation between Super League and [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]] was abolished, and 14 teams were granted licences subject to certain criteria. All twelve teams from Super League XIII were given places, as well as former Super League team [[Salford City Reds]] and [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]]. This was the final year of the initial licencing cycle; a new set of licences [[2012â14 Super League licences|would be awarded for 2012â14]].

Geographically, the vast majority of teams in Super League are based in the north of England, four teams â [[Warrington Wolves|Warrington]], [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]], [[Salford City Reds|Salford]] and [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] â to the west of [[the Pennines]] in Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, and seven teams to the east in Yorkshire â [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]], [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]], [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats|Wakefield]], [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]], [[Castleford Tigers|Castleford]], [[Hull F.C.|Hull]] and [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull KR]]. [[Catalans Dragons]] are the only team based in France and are outside of the UK, [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] are the only team in [[Wales]], and [[Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]] are the only team to be based in a capital city (London).

The maps below indicate the locations of teams that competed in Super League XVI.

==Rules==
===Rule changes===
*A new stricter variation on the ruck and holding down was introduced in 2011. When the referee calls &quot;held&quot; and &quot;move&quot;, the tackle is deemed to be completed, and any further infringement from that point on in the ruck is penalised.

===Operational rules===

* All Super League clubs agreed to operate within the Â£1.7million salary cap for their top 25 first-tier players.

* Quota spots were reduced to 5, meaning only 5 players could be from abroad. However, players from France, Samoa, Tonga and Papua New Guinea all count as federation-trained and thus do not count against the quota.

The play-offs commenced following the conclusion of the 27-round regular season. To decide the grand finalists from the top eight finishing teams, Super League uses its unique [[Super League play-offs|play-off system]]. The finals concluded with the [[2011 Super League Grand Final]].

[[Sky Sports]] continued coverage in the UK that saw two live matches broadcast each week â one on Friday night at 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm and another usually on Saturday evenings. Regular commentators were [[Eddie Hemmings (rugby league)|Eddie Hemmings]] and [[Mike Stephenson]] with summarisers including [[Phil Clarke]], [[Barrie McDermott]] and [[Terry O'Connor (rugby league)|Terry O'Connor]].  Highlights were shown on ''[[Boots N' All]]'', shown on Sky Sports and rebroadcast on the Internet.

[[BBC Sport]] broadcast a highlights programme called the [[Super League Show]], usually presented by [[Harry Gration]]. The BBC elected to broadcast this only to the [[BBC North West|North West]], [[BBC Yorkshire|Yorkshire &amp; North Midlands]], [[BBC North East and Cumbria|North East &amp; Cumbria]], and [[BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire|East Yorkshire &amp; Lincolnshire]] regions on a Sunday. A national repeat was broadcast overnight during the week; the BBC Director of Sport, Richard Moseley, commented that this move was in response to the growing popularity and awareness of the sport, and the large number of requests from people who want to want to watch it elsewhere in the UK. End of season play-offs are shown across the whole country in a highlights package. Super League Show is available for streaming or downloaded using the [[BBC iPlayer]] in the UK.

Orange Sport TV in France aired every Catalans Dragons home match either live or via tape delay.

Internationally Super League is shown live on [[ShowSports|Showtime Sports]] (Middle East), [[SKY Sport 1 (New Zealand)|Sky Sport]] (New Zealand), [[NTV+]] (Russia), [[Sportklub|SportKlub]] (Eastern Europe).

2011 was also the last of a three-year deal in which the [[Nine Network]] in Australia showed up to 70 live games from Super League over the life of the contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;rleague15-11-08&quot;&gt;{{cite web| publisher=RLeague.com | title=Channel Nine to show English Super League and Challenge Cup |author=engage Super League (Press Release) |url=http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=31935| date=2008-11-15 |accessdate=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SB17-11-08&quot;&gt;{{cite web| publisher=SportsBusiness | title=Channel Nine inks RFL deals|author=SportBusiness |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/168294/channel-nine-inks-rfl-deals| date=2008-11-17 |accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
