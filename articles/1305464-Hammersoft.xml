'''Ãtienne Maurice Falconet''' (December 1, 1716 â January 4, 1791) is counted among the first rank of [[France|French]] [[Rococo]] [[sculpture|sculptors]], whose patron was [[Mme de Pompadour]].

==Life==
Falconet was born to a poor family in [[Paris]]. He was at first apprenticed to a carpenter, but some of his clay figures, with the making of which he occupied his leisure hours, attracted the notice of the sculptor [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]], who made him his pupil. One of his most successful early sculptures was of [[Milo of Croton]], which secured his admission to the membership of the [[AcadÃ©mie des beaux-arts]] in 1754.

He came to prominent public attention in the [[Paris Salon|Salon]]s of 1755 and 1757 with his marbles of ''LâAmour'' and the ''Nymphe descendant au bain'' (also called &quot;The Bather&quot;), which is now at the [[Louvre]]. In 1757 Falconet was appointed director of the sculpture atelier of the new ''Manufacture royale de porcelaine'' at [[SÃ¨vres porcelain|SÃ¨vres]], where he brought new life to the manufacture of small sculptures in unglazed [[soft-paste porcelain]] figurines that had been a specialty at the predecessor of the SÃ¨vres manufactory, [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes]]. 

The influence of the painter [[FranÃ§ois Boucher]] and of contemporary theater and ballet are equally in evidence in Falconet's subjects, and his sweet, elegantly erotic, somewhat coy manner. Right at the start, Falconet created for SÃ¨vres a set of white biscuit table garnitures of [[putti]] (Falconet's ''Enfants''), illustrating the Arts, meant to complement the manufacture's grand dinner services. The fashion for similar small table sculptures spread to most of the porcelain manufacturies of Europe.

He remained at the SÃ¨vres post until he was invited to Russia by [[Catherine the Great]] in September 1766. At [[St Petersburg]] he executed a colossal statue of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in bronze, known as the [[Bronze Horseman]], together with his pupil and stepdaughter [[Marie-Anne Collot]]. In 1788, back in Paris he became director of the AcadÃ©mie des beaux-arts. Many of Falconet's religious works, commissioned for churches, were destroyed at the time of the [[French Revolution]]. His work on private commission fared better.

He found time to study [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and also wrote several brochures on art: [[Denis Diderot]] confided to him the chapter on &quot;Sculpture&quot; in the ''[[EncyclopÃ©die]]'', separately released by Falconet as ''RÃ©flexions sur la sculpture'' in 1768. Three years later, he published ''Observations sur la statue de Marc-AurÃ¨le'', which may be interpreted as the artistic program for his statue of Peter the Great. Falconet's writings on art, his ''Oeuvres littÃ©raires'' came to six volumes when they were first published, at [[Lausanne]], in 1781-1782.

Falconet's somewhat prettified and too easy [[Rococo]] charm incurred the criticism of the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'' 1911:
''&quot;His artistic productions are characterized by the same defects as his writings, for though manifesting considerable cleverness and some power of imagination, they display in many cases a false and fantastic taste, the result, most probably, of an excessive striving after originality.&quot;''

In 2001/2002, when the MusÃ©e de CÃ©ramique at SÃ¨vres mounted an exhibition of Falconet's production for SÃ¨vres, 1757 - 1766, its subtitle was ''&quot; lâart de plaire&quot;'' (&quot;the art of pleasing.&quot;) [http://www.rmn.fr/fr/03expo/01calendrier/2001/falconet/page.html]
