&quot;'''Tragedy'''&quot; is a song recorded by the [[Bee Gees]], included on their 1979 album ''[[Spirits Having Flown]]''. The single reached number one in the [[UK singles chart|UK]] in February 1979 and repeated the feat the following month on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Though not originally in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', it has subsequently been added to the musical score of the [[West End theatre|West End]] version of the movie-[[Musical theatre|musical]].

The song knocked &quot;[[I Will Survive]]&quot; by [[Gloria Gaynor]] off the top spot in the U.S. for two weeks before that song again returned to number one for an additional week.

In 1979, [[NBC]] aired ''[[The Bee Gees Special]]'' which showed how the sound effect for the explosion was created. Barry cupped his hands over a microphone and made an exploding sound. Several of these sounds were then mixed together creating one large boom heard on the record.
This song is also playable on Rock Band 3.
