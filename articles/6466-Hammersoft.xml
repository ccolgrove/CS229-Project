'''Connecticut''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Connecticut.ogg|k|É|Ë|n|É|t|É¨|k|É|t}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/connecticut|title= Connecticut - Definitions from Dictionary.com |accessdate=September 17, 2007 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkvMGho |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a state in the [[New England]] region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by [[Rhode Island]] to the east, [[Massachusetts]] to the north, and the state of [[New York]] to the west and the south (with which it shares a water boundary in [[Long Island Sound]]).

Connecticut is named for the [[Connecticut River]], the major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. Its capital city is [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Much of southern and western Connecticut (along with the majority of the state's population) is part of the [[New York metropolitan area]]; three of Connecticut's eight counties are statistically included in the [[New York metropolitan area#Components of the metropolitan area|New York City combined statistical area]], the same area is widely referred to as the [[Tri-State area (NY-NJ-CT)|Tri-State area]]. Connecticut's center of population is in [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/COP/ct_links.htm|title= State of Connecticut Center of Population - From ngs.noaa.gov|accessdate=2009-01-30 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkvhYPB |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is also located within the Tri-State area.

Connecticut is the 29th [[List of U.S. states by population|most populous state]], with 3.5&amp;nbsp;million residents, and is ranked 48th [[List of U.S. states by area|in size by area]], making it the 4th [[List of U.S. states by population density|most densely populated state]]. Called the ''[[Connecticut#Constitutional history|Constitution State]]'', ''[[Nutmeg]] State'', and &quot;The Land of Steady Habits&quot;,&lt;ref name=SOTS/&gt; Connecticut was influential in the development of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the United States.

Connecticut's first European settlers were [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and established a small, short-lived settlement in present-day Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] rivers, called ''[[Fort Hoop|Huys de Goede Hoop]]''. Initially, half of Connecticut was a part of the Dutch colony, [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] rivers.

The first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers overland from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded what would become the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. Both the Connecticut and New Haven Colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in North America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a [[royal charter]], making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This colony was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]].

The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along the Long Island Sound have given the state a strong [[wiktionary:Maritime|maritime]] tradition, which continues today. Connecticut's other traditional industry is financial services; for example, insurance companies in Hartford and [[hedge funds]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield county]]. As of the 2010 Census, Connecticut features the highest per capita income, [[Human Development Index]] (0.962), and [[Household income in the United States|median household income]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=November 29, 2005| title=Highest wages in East, lowest in South|work=USA Today| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2005-11-29-wage_x.htm | first1=Stephen | last1=Ohlemacher | accessdate=2010-04-30|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkvtVNF |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=March 18, 2000| title=Census 2000| publisher=United States Census Bureau| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-_box_head_nbr=GCT-P14&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&amp;-format=US-9|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkweQ74 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=July 17, 2008| title=US slips down development index|publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7511426.stm|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkxLjnC |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Connecticut is a wealthy state by most measures, the income gap between its urban and suburban areas is striking, with several of Connecticut's cities ranking among the nation's poorest and most dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/nyregion/09income.html | work=The New York Times | title=Income Gap in Connecticut Is Growing Fastest, Study Finds | date=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://os.cqpress.com/citycrime/2010/City_crime_rate_2010-2011_hightolow.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York State]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital is [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and other major cities (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.
[[File:Approaching Summit Again.JPG|left|thumb|155px|Bear Mountain, highest peak in Connecticut.]]

The highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42Â° 3' N; 73Â° 29' W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in the southeastern [[New London County]], it features beaches and maritime activities.

Although Connecticut has a long maritime history, and a reputation based on that history, Connecticut has no direct access to the sea. The jurisdiction of New York actually extends east at [[Fishers Island]], where New York shares a sea border with [[Rhode Island]] dividing [[Narragansett Bay]]. Although Connecticut has easy access to the Atlantic, between [[Long Island Sound]] and [[Block Island Sound]], Connecticut has no direct ocean coast.

Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns center around a &quot;[[village green|green]]&quot;, such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in the state), and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white church, a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or &quot;[[inne]]&quot;, several [[colonial house]]s, and so on, establishing a scenic historic appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism.

Connecticut consists of [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]. [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of [[Quercus|oaks]], [[Carya|hickories]], and [[Acer (genus)|maple]] cover much of the state.&lt;ref name = &quot;ecoregions&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Olson |title = Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year = 2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages= 933â938 |url = http://gis.wwfus.org/wildfinder/ |doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkyhbI6 |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no |author-separator = , |author2 = D.

The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the distinctive Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;mile (4.0&amp;nbsp;km) square detour into Connecticut. The actual origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which was finally concluded in 1804, when southern Southwick, (whose residents sought to leave Massachusetts), was split in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf | title=The Southwick Jog|format=PDF|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5p1plFeFC |archivedate = 2010-04-16|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm|title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog| publisher=Connecticut State Library|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkzcI4A |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southwestern border of Connecticut, where it abuts New York State, is marked by a [[panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] and part of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm| title=Connecticut's &quot;Panhandle&quot;| publisher=Connecticut State Library|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uKl03gYx |archivedate = 2010-11-18|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include: [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]]; [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]]; and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Connecticut | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate = 2008-07-15 | url = http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scoville Memorial Libraries collection began in 1771, when Richard Smith, owner of a local blast furnace, used community contributions to buy 200 books in London. Patrons could borrow and return books on the third Monday of every third month. Fees were collected for damages, the most common being &quot;greasing&quot; by wax dripped from the candles by which the patrons read.

===Climate===
Interior portions of Connecticut have a [[humid continental climate]], while the Connecticut shoreline (the state's southern four counties) has a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] (sometimes statistically meeting this climate's criteria, sometimes not) with seasonal extremes tempered by proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. The city of Bridgeport (on Long Island Sound), like most other areas in [[Tri-State Region|metropolitan New York]], typically falls within the humid subtropical climate zone under the [[KÃ¶ppen Climate Classification]] system. Hartford (35&amp;nbsp;miles inland) has a humid continental climate. Consistent with its coastal reputation, Connecticut is a moderately sunny state, averaging between 2,400 and 2,800 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm|title=united states annual sunshine map|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=2011-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winters are generally considered to be cold, with average temperatures ranging from 38&amp;nbsp;Â°F (3&amp;nbsp;Â°C) in the maritime influenced southeast to 29&amp;nbsp;Â°F (â2&amp;nbsp;Â°C) in the northwest in January. The average yearly snowfall is about 20â60&quot;(54â189&amp;nbsp;cm) across the state, with higher totals in the northwest. Spring has variable temperatures with frequent rainfall. Summer is hot and humid throughout the state, with average highs in New London of 81&amp;nbsp;Â°F (27&amp;nbsp;Â°C) and 87&amp;nbsp;Â°F (31&amp;nbsp;Â°C) in Windsor Locks. Fall months are mild and bring colorful foliage across the state in October and November. During hurricane season, tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the summer, occurring on average 30 times annually. These storms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;tornadoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif| title=Annual average number of tornadoes| publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center| accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut's warmest temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the coldest temperature is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943 and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&amp;state=CT|title=All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[NOAA]]|accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the state is an Anglicized version of the Algonquian word &quot;quinatucquet&quot;, meaning &quot;upon the long river&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Project&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Federal Writers' Project|title=Connecticut: A Guide to Its Roads, Lore and People|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CPYfSsQ-WE4C&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=September 23, 2010|publisher=US History Publishers|isbn=978-1-60354-007-0|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Connecticut region was inhabited by the [[Mohegan]] tribe prior to European colonization. The first European explorer in Connecticut was the Dutch explorer [[Adriaen Block]]. After he explored this region in 1614, Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River (then known by the Dutch as Versche Rivier â &quot;Fresh River&quot;) and built a fort at Dutch Point in what is present-day Hartford, which they called &quot;House of Hope&quot; ({{lang-nl|Huis van Hoop}}).

[[John Winthrop the Younger|John Winthrop]], then of Massachusetts, received permission to create a new colony at [[Saybrook Colony|Old Saybrook]] at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635. This was the first of three distinct colonies that later would be combined to make up Connecticut. Saybrook Colony was a direct challenge to Dutch claims. The colony was not more than a small outpost and never matured. In 1644, the Saybrook Colony merged itself into the Connecticut Colony.

The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/earlysettlers.htm |title=Early Settlers of Connecticut â Connecticut State Library |publisher=Cslib.org |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. The settlers were [[Puritan]]s from Massachusetts, led by [[Thomas Hooker]]. Hooker had been prominent in England and was a professor of theology at Cambridge. He was also an important political writer and made a significant contribution to Constitutional theory. He broke with the political leadership in Massachusetts, and, just as [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] created a new polity in [[Rhode Island]], Hooker and his cohort did the same and established the [[Connecticut Colony]] at Hartford in 1636. This was the second of the three colonies.

The third colony was founded in March 1638. [[New Haven Colony]] (originally known as the Quinnipiack Colony) was established by [[John Davenport (clergyman)|John Davenport]], [[Theophilus Eaton]], and others at New Haven. The New Haven Colony had its own constitution, &quot;The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony&quot;, which was signed on June 4, 1639.

Because the Dutch were outnumbered by the flood of English settlers from Massachusetts, they left their fort in 1654.

Neither the establishment of the Connecticut Colony or the Quinnipiack Colony was carried out with the sanction of the English Crown, and they were independent political entities. They naturally were presumptively English, but in a legal sense, they were only secessionist outposts of Massachusetts Bay. In 1662, Winthrop took advantage of this void in political affairs and obtained in England the charter by which the colonies of Connecticut and Quinnipiack were united. Although Winthrop's charter favored the Connecticut colony, New Haven remained a seat of government with Hartford until after the American Revolution.

Winthrop was very politically astute and secured the charter from the newly restored [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who granted the most liberal political terms.

Historically important colonial settlements included:
:[[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] (1633)
:[[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] (1634)
:[[Deep River, Connecticut|Saybrook]] (1635)
:[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] (1636)
:[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] (1638)
:[[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] (1639)
:[[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]] (1639)
:[[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] (1639)
:[[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] (1639)
:[[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] (1640)
:[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] (1641)
:[[New London, Connecticut|New London]] (1646)

Its first constitution, the &quot;[[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]]&quot;, was adopted on January 14, 1639, while its [[Connecticut Constitution|current constitution]], the third for Connecticut, was adopted in 1965. Connecticut is the fifth of the original 13 states. The original constitutions influenced the US Constitution as one of the leading authors was [[Roger Sherman]] of New Haven.

The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. According to the Hartford Treaty with the Dutch, signed on September 19, 1650, but never ratified by the British, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich Bay]] for a distance of 20&amp;nbsp;miles&lt;ref name=&quot;BOWEN&quot;&gt;Bowen, Clarence Winthrop: ''Boundary Disputes of Connecticut'': Boston, Massachusetts: 1882.

This agreement was observed by both sides until war erupted between England and The Netherlands in 1652. No other limits were found. Conflict over uncertain colonial limits continued until the [[Duke of York]] captured [[New Netherland]] in 1664.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BOWEN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FLICK&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, Connecticut's original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the &quot;South Sea&quot;, i.e. the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Callison, LCITS |url=http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/colony.shtml |title=Connecticut Colony Charter of 1662 |publisher=Law.ou.edu |date=2006-03-14 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctheritage.org/encyclopedia/topicalsurveys/migration.htm Migration from Connecticut] By Barbara Lacey, Connecticut's Heritage Gateway website.&lt;/ref&gt; Most colonial royal grants were for long east-west strips. Connecticut took its grant seriously, and established a ninth county between the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Delaware River]]s, named [[Westmoreland County, Connecticut|Westmoreland County]]. This resulted in the brief [[Pennamite Wars]] with [[Pennsylvania]].

Connecticut's lands also extended across northern Ohio, called the [[Western Reserve]] lands. The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio. Agreements with Pennsylvania and New York extinguished the land claims by Connecticut within its neighbors, creating the [[Connecticut Panhandle]].  The Western Reserve lands were relinquished to the federal government, which brought the state to its present boundaries other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts.

[[File:Connecticut population map.png|right|thumb|200px|Connecticut Population Density Map.]]

As of 2005, Connecticut has an estimated population of 3,510,297,&lt;ref name=stateest&gt;{{cite web |date=June 21, 2006 | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/states/tables/NST-EST2005-01.csv | title = Annual Estimates of the Population for the United States and States, and for Puerto Rico: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2005|format = [[Comma-separated values|CSV]] | work=2005 Population Estimates | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division | accessdate =2006-11-17|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr524oZs |archivedate = 2010-01-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an increase of 11,331, or 0.3%, from the prior year and an increase of 104,695, or 3.1%, since the year 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 67,427 people (that is 222,222 births minus 154,795 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 41,718 people into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 75,991 people, and [[Human migration|migration]] within the country produced a net loss of 34,273 people. Based on the 2005 estimates, Connecticut moves from the 29th most populous state to 30th.&lt;ref name=stateest/&gt;

6.6% of its population was reported as being under 5 years old, 24.7% under 18 years old, and 13.8% were 65 years of age or older. Females made up approximately 51.6% of the population, with 48.4% male.

In 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as &quot;rural&quot;. The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, it was only 12.3%. Most of western and southern Connecticut (particularly the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]]) is strongly associated with New York City; this area is the most affluent and populous region of the state. Eastern Connecticut is more culturally influenced by the greater New England area, including the cities of Boston and Providence.

The [[center of population]] of Connecticut is located in the town of [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Population and Population Centers by State â 2000 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate = 2008-12-04 | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqyj8Y7G |archivedate = 2010-01-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race, ancestry, and language===

According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], Connecticut had a population of 3,574,097. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 77.6% White (71.2% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 10.1% Black or African American, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.8% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 5.6% from Some Other Race, and 2.6% from Two or More Races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 13.4% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_QTPL&amp;prodType=table&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, 11.4% of the population (400,000) was foreign-born, and 10% of the foreign-born in the state were illegal aliens (about 1.1% of the population). In 1870, native-born Americans had accounted for 75% of the state's population, but that had dropped to 35% by 1918.

As of 2000, 81.69% of Connecticut residents age 5 and older spoke English at home and 8.42% spoke Spanish, followed by Italian at 1.59%, French at 1.31% and Polish at 1.20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;state_id=9&amp;mode=state_tops&amp;order=r| title = Most spoken languages in Connecticut| accessdate = 2007-01-16| work=MLA Language Map| publisher=The Modern Language Association|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930171318/http%3A//www.mla.org/map_data_results%26state_id%3D9%26mode%3Dstate_tops%26order%3Dr |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut has large Italian American, Irish American and [[English American]] populations, as well as [[German American]] and [[Portuguese American]] populations, second highest percentage of any state, behind Rhode Island (19.3%). [[Italian American|Italian]] is the largest ancestry group in five of the state's counties, while the [[Irish American|Irish]] are the largest group in Tolland county, [[French Canadians]] the largest group in Windham county. African Americans and [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanics]] (mostly [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]]) are numerous in the urban areas of the state. Connecticut is also known for its relatively large [[Hungarian American]] population, the majority of which live in and around [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Naugatuck, Connecticut|Naugatuck]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. Connecticut also has a sizable [[Polish American]] population, with [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] containing the largest [[Polish American]] population in the state.

More recent immigrant populations include those from [[India]], Laos, [[Vietnam]], Thailand, [[Indonesia]], Mexico, [[Brazil]], Guatemala, [[Panama]], Jamaica, [[Haiti]], Cape Verde and former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries.

===Religion===
A 2001 survey of Connecticut residents' religious self-identification showed the following distribution of affiliations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/research_briefs/aris/key_findings.htm |title=American Religious Identification Survey, Key Findings, Exhibit 15 |accessdate=2007-01-04 |author=Mayer, Egon |coauthors=Kosmin, Barry A., Keysar, Ariela |year=2001 |publisher=[[City University of New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish American|Jewish congregations]] had 108,280 (3.2%) members in 2000;&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/20_2000.asp The Association of Religion Data Archives] Maps &amp; Reports â State Membership Report / Kansas / Denominational Groups, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish population is concentrated in the towns near Long Island Sound between [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], in [[Greater New Haven]] and in [[Greater Hartford]], especially the suburb of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]]. According to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]], the largest Christian denominations, by number of adherents, in 2000 were: the Catholic Church, with 1,372,562; the [[United Church of Christ]], with 124,770; and the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], with 73,550.&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda.com&quot;/&gt;

Recent immigration has brought other non-Christian religions to the state, but the numbers of adherents of other religions are still low.

Connecticut is also home to New England's largest Protestant Church: [[The First Cathedral]] in [[Bloomfield, Connecticut]] located in [[Hartford County]].

Hartford is seat to the Roman Catholic [[Archdiocese of Hartford]], which is sovereign over the [[Diocese of Bridgeport]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]].}

As with Bridgeport, New Haven and other cities in the state, Hartford is surrounded by wealthier suburbs. The state's unemployment rate in August 2011 was 9.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Area Unemployment Statistics|url=http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstch.htm|publisher=BLS|accessdate=September 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
Prior to 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only [[income tax]] system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing.

In 1991, under Governor [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], an Independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. Since then, [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], has become the headquarters for a large number of America's largest [[hedge fund]]s. As of 2011, the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals are divided into six tax brackets of 3%, 5%, 5.5%, 6%, 6.5% and 6.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011Sect6Summary&quot; /&gt; All wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.

Connecticut levies a 6.35% state [[sales tax]] on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.&lt;ref name=2011Sect6Summary&gt;[http://www.ct.gov/drs/cwp/view.asp?A=1514&amp;Q=480936 &quot;Summary of Tax Provisions Contained in 2011 Conn. Pub. Acts 6&quot;], retrieved July 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some items and services in general are not subject to sales and use taxes unless specifically enumerated as taxable by [[statute]]. A provision excluding clothing under $50 from sales tax was repealed as of July 1, 2011.&lt;ref name=2011Sect6Summary /&gt; There are no additional sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions. During the summer, there is one week during which sales tax on certain items and quantities of clothing is not imposed in order to assist those with children returning to school.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

All real and personal property located within the state of Connecticut is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. All assessments are at 70% of [[fair market value]]. Another 20% of the value may be taxed by the local government though. The maximum property tax credit is $500 per return and any excess may not be refunded or carried forward.&lt;ref name=inctax&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ct.gov/drs/lib/drs/forms/2009forms/incometax/ct-1040booklet.pdf |title=Connecticut income tax instructions |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-25|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uCmk84cj |archivedate = 2010-11-13|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut does not levy an intangible personal [[property tax]].

===Industries===
The agricultural produce of the state includes [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery stock]]; [[egg (food)|eggs]]; [[clams]] and [[lobster]] ([[shellfish]]); [[dairy product]]s; cattle; and [[Types of tobacco#Shade tobacco|tobacco]]. Its industrial output includes transportation equipment, especially [[helicopter]]s, aircraft parts, and [[nuclear submarine]]s; heavy industrial machinery and electrical equipment; military weaponry; fabricated metal products; [[chemical]] and [[pharmaceutical]] products; and [[Measuring instrument|scientific instruments]].

Due to the prominence of the aircraft industry in the state, Connecticut has an official state aircraft, the [[F4U Corsair]], and an official Connecticut Aviation Pioneer, [[Igor Sikorsky]]. The state officially recognizes aircraft designer [[Gustav Whitehead]] as &quot;Father of Connecticut Aviation&quot; for his research into powered flight in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] in 1901, two years before the [[Wright brothers]] at [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = O'Dwyer | first = Maj.

This provides $9&amp;nbsp;billion in personal income for Connecticut residents and $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion in state and local revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandtourism.org/cct/lib/cct/Econ_Summary_Web2_%282%29.pdf The Economic Impact of the Arts, Film, History, and Tourism Industries in Connecticut (Highlights)]

==Transportation==
[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|300px|right|thumb|Map of Connecticut showing major highways.]]

===Roads===
{{main|List of State Routes in Connecticut}}
The [[Interstate highway]]s in the state are [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] (the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]) running southwest to northeast along the coast, [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] running southwest to northeast in the center of the state, [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] running north to south in the center of the state, and [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut)|I-395]] running north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Route 15 (Connecticut)|State Route 15]], running from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York State]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven]] and running parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut]]. Route 15 and I-95 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ Connecticut Turnpike (I-95)] nycroads.com&lt;/ref&gt; Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7]] in the west running parallel to the NY border, [[Route 8 (Connecticut)|State Route 8]] farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and running north-south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with U.S. 7, and [[Route 9 (Connecticut)|State Route 9]] in the east. See [[List of State Routes in Connecticut]] for an overview of the state's highway system.

Between New Haven and the New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area. This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity, resulting in lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[ride-sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrides.com/ |title=ctrides.com |publisher=ctrides.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycling ownership and use in the United States. New Haven's cycling community, organized in a local advocacy group called [[ElmCityCycling]], is particularly active. According to the U.S. Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.

===Public transportation===
[[File:Metro-North train 1567 enters Stamford.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]] train at [[Stamford Transportation Center|Stamford]].]]

====Rail====
Southwestern Connecticut is served by MTA's [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]], providing commuter service to New York City and New Haven, with branches servicing [[New Canaan Branch|New Canaan]], [[Danbury Branch|Danbury]], and [[Waterbury Branch|Waterbury]]. Connecticut lies along [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] which features frequent [[Northeast Regional]] and [[Acela Express]] service. Towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the [[Shore Line East]] commuter line. Operation of commuter trains from New Haven to Springfield on Amtrak's [[New Haven-Springfield Line]] is under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhhsrail.com/ |title=NHHS Rail |publisher=NHHS Rail |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amtrak also operates a shuttle service between New Haven and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], servicing Hartford and other towns on the corridor.

====Bus====
Statewide [[bus]] service is supplied by [[Connecticut Transit]], owned by the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. A three-year construction project to build a [[bus rapid transit|BRT]] [[New BritainâHartford Busway|busway from New Britain to Hartford]] began in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Britain-to-Hartford âBuswayâ Receives Final Federal Design Approval |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=2006-10-31 |url=http://www.ct.gov/governorrell/cwp/view.asp?Q=326626&amp;A=2425 |accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrapidtransit.com/ct_schedule.asp |title=New Britain-Hartford Rapid Transit Project Schedule |publisher=Ctrapidtransit.com |accessdate=2010-07-25}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Air====
[[Bradley International Airport]] is located in [[Windsor Locks]], 15&amp;nbsp;miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Regional air service is provided at [[Tweed New Haven Regional Airport]]. Larger civil airports include [[Danbury Municipal Airport]] and [[Waterbury-Oxford Airport]] in western Connecticut. [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation. The [[Westchester County Airport]] in [[Harrison, New York]] serves much of southwestern Connecticut.

===Constitutional history===
{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}
Connecticut is known as the &quot;Constitution State&quot;. While the origin on this title is uncertain, the nickname is assumed to refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638â39. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of [[Connecticut Constitutional History]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.

Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.
Another possible source of the nickname &quot;constitution state&quot; comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution.

===Executive===
The governor heads the executive branch. [[Dan Malloy]] is the current [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]] and [[Nancy Wyman]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]], both are Democrats. Malloy, the former mayor of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], won the [[Connecticut gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 general election]] for Governor, and was sworn in on January 5, 2011. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. Connecticut was the first state in the United States to elect a woman as governor without electing her husband first, [[Ella Grasso]] in 1974.

There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, Developmental Services, Education, Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Information Technology, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Safety, Public Utility Control, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ct.gov/ctportal/cwp/view.asp?a=843&amp;q=246450| title=Connecticut's Executive Branch of Government| publisher=ct.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four year terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt;

===Legislative===
The legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Senators and representatives, all of whom must be at least 18 years of age, are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[President pro tempore]] presides. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House; [[Chris Donovan]] is the current Speaker of the House of Connecticut.

Connecticut's U.S. senators are [[Richard Blumenthal]] (Democrat) and [[Joseph I. Lieberman]] ([[Connecticut for Lieberman]], [[Independent Democrat]]) who is part of the Democratic Caucus. Connecticut currently has five [[U.S. Congressional Delegations from Connecticut|representatives in the U.S. House]], all of whom are Democrats. Connecticut and [[Vermont]] remain the only two states with Independent Senators.

===Judicial===
The highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. The current [[Chief Justice]] is [[Chase T. Rogers]].

In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jud.state.ct.us/ystday/history.html History of the Connecticut Courts]. Last retrieved 2007-02-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Appellate Court is a lesser state-wide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states.

===Local government===

::''and several lists:'' [[List of municipalities of Connecticut by population]], [[List of towns in Connecticut]], [[List of cities in Connecticut]], [[Borough (Connecticut)]], [[List of counties in Connecticut]]
Connecticut has 169 [[New England town|towns]], which serve as the fundamental local political subdivision of the state; the entire state is divided into towns.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; Connecticut shares a local form of government with the rest of [[New England]] called the [[New England town]]. There are also 21 cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; most of which are coterminous with their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: [[Groton (city), Connecticut|City of Groton]], which is a subsection of the [[Groton (town), Connecticut|Town of Groton]] and the City of [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]] in the Town of [[Winchester, Connecticut|Winchester]]. There are also nine incorporated [[Borough (Connecticut)|boroughs]] which may provide additional services to a section of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cslib.org/boroughcity.htm Connecticut's Boroughs and Cities]. Connecticut State Library. Retrieved January 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; One, [[Naugatuck]], is a consolidated town and borough.

Unlike most other states, Connecticut does not have [[County (United States)|county]] government. Connecticut county governments were mostly eliminated in 1960, with the exception of [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]] elected in each county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/RegisterManual/SectionVI/SecVICounty.htm |title= Connecticut State Register and Manual: Counties |accessdate=2006-11-07| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061010172922/http://www.sots.ct.gov/RegisterManual/SectionVI/SecVICounty.htm| archivedate = October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the county sheriff was abolished and replaced with the [[Connecticut State Marshal|state marshal]] system, which has districts that follow the old county territories. The judicial system is divided, at the trial court level, into judicial districts which largely follow the old county lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/directory/directory/location/Default.htm |title=State of Connecticut Judicial Branch |publisher=Jud.ct.gov |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[list of Connecticut counties|eight counties]] are still widely used for purely geographical and statistical purposes, such as [[Weather forecasting|weather reports]], and census reporting.

The state is divided into 15 [[Administrative divisions of Connecticut#Regions|planning regions]] defined by the state Office of Planning and Management.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Enter your Company or Top-Level Office |url=http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2985&amp;q=383124 |title=Regional Planning Coordination at the CT Office of Planning and Management |publisher=Ct.gov |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions. Each region has an administrative body known as either a regional council of governments, a regional council of elected officials, or a regional planning agency. The regions are established for the purpose of planning &quot;coordination of regional and state planning activities; redesignation of logical planning regions and promotion of the continuation of regional planning organizations within the state; and provision for technical aid and the administration of financial assistance to regional planning organizations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OPM&quot;/&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
{{See also|Same-sex marriage in Connecticut}}
On November 12, 2008, Connecticut became the second state (after Massachusetts) to allow marriages of same-sex couples. Connecticut was the third state to do so, but only the second where the decision was not repealed.

Currently, Connecticut leans strongly towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. However, Connecticut has a high percentage of voters who are not registered with a major party. As of 2004, 33.7% of registered voters were registered Democratic, 22.0% were registered Republican, and 44.0% were unaffiliated with any party, with 0.2% registered with a minor party&lt;!-- editor's note: figures do not add up to 100% due to rounding errors --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sots.ct.gov/ElectionsServices/election_results/statistics/enrolhst.pdf Party Enrollment in Connecticut]. Connecticut Office of the Secretary of State. Last retrieved 2007-02-22. {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Connecticut towns show a marked preference for moderate candidates of either party. The state's Republican-leaning areas are the rural [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]] and adjoining towns in the west of [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]], the industrial towns of the [[Naugatuck River Valley]], and some of the affluent [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] towns near the New York border.

The suburban towns of [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] and [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in Fairfield County are considered the most Republican areas in the state. [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], a wealthy town a few miles to the east, is often considered one of the most loyally-Democratic, liberal towns in Fairfield County. The historically Republican-leaning wealthy town of [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]] voted in the majority for [[Barack Obama]] in the 2008 Presidential Election. [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], two larger, affluent communities in Fairfield County, have in many elections favored moderate Republicans including former Governor [[John G. Rowland]] and former Congressman [[Chris Shays]], however they have favored Democrats in recent US presidential election years, with Shays being defeated by Democrat [[Jim Himes]] in the 2008 election.

[[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] has a Democratic registration edge, but usually favors conservative candidates in both parties. In [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] unaffiliated voters outnumber voters registered with either major party. Other smaller cities including [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]] favor Democratic candidates.

In July, 2009 the Connecticut legislature overrode a veto by Governor [[M. Jodi Rell]] to pass [[SustiNet]], the first significant public-option health care reform legislation in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, Democrats controlled all five federal congressional seats. The remaining Republican, [[Chris Shays]], lost his seat to Democrat Jim Himes in the Congressional Election in 2008. [[Joseph Lieberman]] and [[Richard Blumenthal]] are Connecticut's [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]]. The junior Blumenthal is a Democrat while the senior Lieberman serves as an [[Independent Democrat]] caucusing with Senate Democrats after his victory on the [[Connecticut for Lieberman]] ballot line in the 2006 general election.

Lieberman's predecessor, [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], was the last Connecticut Republican to serve as Senator. Weicker was known as a liberal Republican. He broke with President [[Richard Nixon]] during [[Watergate Scandal|Watergate]] and successfully ran for governor in 1990 as an independent, creating [[A Connecticut Party]] as his election vehicle. Before Weicker, the last [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to represent Connecticut in the Senate was [[Prescott Bush]], the father of former President [[George H.W. Bush]] and the grandfather of former President [[George W. Bush]]. He served from 1953â1963.

Connecticut is the home of [[Yale University]], established in 1701, one of the most academically renowned and selective universities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/28392| title = Admit rate falls to record-low 7.5 percent| publisher=[[Yale Daily News]]| date = March 31, 2009| accessdate =2009-04-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yale is one of the largest employers in the state, and its research activity has recently spun off dozens of growing biotechnology companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalemedicine.yale.edu/ym_fw0001/biotech/biotech1.html |title=&quot;New Haven's Biotech Boom,&quot; Yale Medicine, Fall 2000/Winter 2001 |publisher=Yalemedicine.yale.edu |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mckay |first=David |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/16yalect.html |title=Yale and New Haven Find Common Ground|location=New Haven (Conn) |work=The New York Times  |date=2007-12-16 |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Connecticut hosts many other academic institutions, including [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] (1823), [[Wesleyan University]] (1832), [[University of Hartford]] (1877), [[Post University]] (1890), [[Connecticut College]] (1911), [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] (1915) and [[Quinnipiac University]] (1929). The [[University of Connecticut]] (1881) has been the highest ranked public university in New England from 1998 to 2010, according to ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uconn.edu/rankings.php] (Note: US News and World Report is a subscription website.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut was home to the nation's first law school, [[Litchfield Law School]], which operated from 1773 to 1833 in [[Litchfield, Connecticut|Litchfield]]. [[Hartford Public High School]] (1638) is the third-oldest secondary school in the nation after the [[Collegiate School (New York)|Collegiate School]] (1628) in [[Manhattan]] and the [[Boston Latin School]] (1635).

Connecticut has been the home to multiple teams in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|big four sports leagues]], though currently hosts none. Connecticut's longest-tenured and only modern full-time &quot;big four&quot; franchise were the [[Hartford Whalers]] of the [[National Hockey League]], who played in Hartford from 1979 to 1997 at the [[Hartford Civic Center]]. Their departure to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], over disputes with the state over the construction of a new arena, caused great controversy and resentment. The former Whalers are now known as the [[Carolina Hurricanes]].

Connecticut has hosted teams from the other big four leagues at various times. The [[Hartford Dark Blues]] joined the [[National League]] for one season in 1876, becoming the state's first and only [[major league baseball]] franchise. In 1926, Hartford had a franchise in the [[National Football League]] known as the [[Hartford Blues]]. The NFL would return to Connecticut from 1973â1974 when New Haven hosted the [[New York Giants]] at [[Yale Bowl]] while [[Giants Stadium]] was under construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryNYG&quot;&gt;[http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/nyg/nygiants.html History of the New York Giants], www.sportsecyclopedia.com. Retrieved September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1975 to 1995, the [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] played a number of home games at the Hartford Civic Center.

The [[Connecticut Sun]] of the [[WNBA]] currently play at the [[Mohegan Sun Arena]] in [[Uncasville]]. From 1996 to 1998, Connecticut was home to another professional woman's basketball team, [[American Basketball League (1996â1998)|American Basketball League]] franchise the [[New England Blizzard]], who played at the Hartford Civic Center

The [[UConn Huskies]] play [[NCAA Division I]] sports and are popular in the state. Both the [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|men's basketball]] and [[Connecticut Huskies women's basketball|women's basketball teams]] have won multiple national championships, including in 2004, when UConn became the first school in NCAA Division I history to have its men's and women's basketball programs win the national title in the same year. The [[UConn Huskies football team]] has played in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] since 2002, and has played in four bowl games since. Other Connecticut universities which feature Division I sports teams include [[Yale Bulldogs|Yale University]], [[Quinnipiac Bobcats|Quinnipiac University]], [[Fairfield Stags|Fairfield University]], [[Central Connecticut State University]], [[Sacred Heart University]], and the [[Hartford Hawks|University of Hartford]]. Several [[United States Coast Guard Academy#Athletics|United States Coast Guard Academy]] teams compete in Division I as well.

New Haven biennially hosts &quot;[[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|The Game]]&quot; between Yale and Harvard, the country's second-oldest college football rivalry. Yale alum [[Walter Camp]], deemed the &quot;Father of American Football,&quot; helped develop modern football while living in New Haven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegefootball.org/famer_selected.php?id=88004 College Football Hall of Fame || Famer Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartford has hosted two [[Arena Football League]] franchises, in the [[Connecticut Coyotes]] from 1995â1996 and the [[New England Sea Wolves]] from 1999â2000, both playing at the Civic Center. Hartford is currently home to the [[Hartford Colonials]] of the [[United Football League (2009)|United Football League]].

Connecticut is a battleground between fans of the [[New York Yankees]], [[Boston Red Sox]], and [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/18/sports/baseball/18fans.html?ei=5088&amp;en=6f3f651e40bd2179&amp;ex=1313553600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | title=Where Do Rivals Draw the Line? | first=John | last=Branch | date=2006-08-18 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mets and Red Sox, split allegiances among fans of both teams in the state during the [[1986 World Series]] led to an article in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' to coin the phrase &quot;Red Sox Nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baseball Border War; In Milford Conn., Geography Brings Sox and Mets Fans|date=October 20, 1986|first=Nathan|last=Cobb|newspaper=Boston Globe|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state hosts several major sporting events. Since 1952, a [[PGA Tour]] golf tournament has been played in the Hartford area. Originally called the &quot;Insurance City Open&quot; and later the &quot;Greater Hartford Open,&quot; the event is now known as the [[Travelers Championship]]. The [[Pilot Pen Tennis]] tournament is held annually in the [[Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center]] at Yale University in New Haven. [[Lime Rock Park]] is a motorsport track home of [[American Le Mans Series]], Grand-Am [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] and [[NASCAR Camping World East Series]] races.

The [[Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference (CIAC)]] is the state's sanctioning body for high school sports.

The name &quot;Connecticut&quot; originates from the [[Mohegan]] word ''quonehtacut'', meaning &quot;place of long tidal river&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ct.gov/ctportal/cwp/view.asp?a=843&amp;q=246434 | title = CT.gov: About Connecticut | accessdate =2005-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut's official nickname, adopted in 1959, is &quot;The Constitution State,&quot; based on its colonial constitution of 1638â1639 which was the first in America and, arguably, the world.&lt;ref name=SOTS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?A=3188&amp;QUESTION_ID=392608|title=SOTS: Sites, Seals &amp; Symbols|accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unofficially (but popularly) Connecticut is also known as ''&quot;The [[Nutmeg]] State&quot;''.&lt;ref name=SOTS/&gt; The origins of the nutmeg connection to Connecticut are unknown. It may have come from its sailors returning from voyages with nutmeg (which in the 18th and 19th centuries was a very valuable spice). It may have originated in the early machined sheet tin nutmeg grinders sold by early Connecticut peddlers. It is also facetiously said to come from [[Yankee]] peddlers from Connecticut who would sell small carved nobs of wood shaped to look like nutmeg to unsuspecting customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/nicknamesCT.htm |title=Nicknames for the State of Connecticut |publisher=Connecticut State Library |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Washington]] gave Connecticut the title of ''&quot;The Provisions State&quot;''&lt;ref name=SOTS/&gt; because of the material aid the state rendered to the [[American Revolutionary War]] effort.

According to Webster's New International Dictionary, 1993, a person who is a native or resident of Connecticut is a &quot;Connecticuter&quot;. There are numerous other terms coined in print, but not in use, such as: &quot;Connecticotian&quot; â [[Cotton Mather]] in 1702. &quot;Connecticutensian&quot; â [[Samuel Peters]] in 1781. &quot;[[Nutmegger]]&quot; is sometimes used,&lt;ref name=cslib&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cslib.org/nicknamesCT.htm| title=Connecticut's Nicknames| publisher=Connecticut State Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is &quot;Yankee&quot; (the official State Song is &quot;[[Yankee Doodle]]&quot;), though this usually refers someone from the wider [[New England]] region (and in the Southern United States, to anyone who lives north of the [[Mason-Dixon Line]]).&lt;ref&gt;See [[Yankee]] main article.&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Allen Walker Read reports a more playful term, 'connecticutie.' The traditional abbreviation of the state's name is &quot;Conn.&quot;; the official [[United States postal abbreviations|postal abbreviation]] is CT.

[[Commemorative stamp]]s issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] with Connecticut themes include [[Nathan Hale]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], [[Noah Webster]], [[Eli Whitney]], the [[whaling]] ship the [[Charles W.
