'''Splashy''' is a [[splash screen]] program for [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s (OSes), such as [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]].

Splashy was designed to replace [[Bootsplash]]. Unlike Bootsplash, it runs completely in [[userspace]] and therefore doesn't require any [[patch (computing)|patch]]es to the OS [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]]. It is hosted by the [[Alioth (Debian)|Alioth]] project, and there are [[deb (file format)|deb packages]] of it.

==Features==

Splashy supports many advanced features such as [[TrueType]]2 fonts, [[computer animation|animation]], [[alpha compositing|alpha channel transparency]] and full [[Linux Standards Base]] support. Splashy uses [[XML]] in its configuration files. There is also a utility called '''SplashyCreator''' that provides a graphical way of configuring themes.
