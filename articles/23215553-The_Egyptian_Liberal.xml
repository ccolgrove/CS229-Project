==Background==
[[Image:Mir Hossein Mousavi in Zanjan by Mardetanha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]]]]
The [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|election of the president of Iran in 2009]] was preceded by [[Iran 2009 election#Opinion polls|many Iranian surveys]] and a survey by the US-based Terror Free Tomorrow organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/|title=Terror Free Tomorrow|accessdate=18 June 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jc8EoPnz|archivedate=2009-09-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Terror Free Tomorrow opinion poll, conducted from 11 May to 20 May 2009 predicted the high participation and showed similar ratios for the candidates to the later official result, with over a quarter yet undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahmadinejad Front Runner in Upcoming Presidential Elections; Iranians Continue to Back Compromise and Better Relations with US and West.

The election for presidency took place on 12 June 2009. Unlike the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|election in 2005]], the 2009 election featured high participation. The results of the elections were announced only 2 hours after the end of the votes, which may seem impossible. The [[Iran 2009 election#Result|official results]] were rejected by all three opposition candidates, who claimed that the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged. The last presidential election had already been [[Iranian presidential election, 2005#Election controversies|controversial]], but this time it escalated. Candidates [[Mohsen Rezaee]] and Mousavi have lodged official complaints. Mousavi announced that he &quot;won't surrender to this manipulation&quot; before lodging an official appeal against the result to the [[Guardian Council]] on 14 June.&lt;ref name=join/&gt;

The [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]], declared the unprecedented voter turnout and coinciding religious holidays as a &quot;divine assessment&quot;, and urged the nation to unite,&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; and later ordered an investigation into the claims of vote fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinaview&quot;/&gt; Referring to Mousavi's appeal letter about the irregularities, Khamenei said that &quot;the Guardian Council has been emphasized to carry out investigation into this letter carefully,&quot; and probe allegations of [[electoral fraud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinaview&quot;/&gt; Mousavi is not optimistic about his appeal, saying that many of the group's members &quot;during the election were not impartial&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;optimistic1&quot;/&gt; Ahmadinejad called the election &quot;completely free&quot; and the outcome &quot;a great victory&quot; for Iran, dismissing the protests as little more than &quot;passions after a [[Association football|soccer]] match&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;join1&quot;/&gt;

According to an analysis by Professor Walter R. Mebane, Jr. from the Department of Statistics of the [[University of Michigan]], considering data from the first stage of the 2005 presidential election produces results that &quot;give moderately strong support for a diagnosis that the 2009 election was affected by significant fraud&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mebane|first=Walter R.|title=Note on the presidential election in Iran, June 2009|date=18 June 2009|format=PDF|url=http://www.umich.edu/~wmebane/note18jun2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UK-based think-tank Chatham House also suspected fraud in the voting process for a number of reasons:&lt;ref name=&quot;chatham&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Analysis of the Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Election|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/Middle%20East/iranelection0609.pdf|date=26 June 2011|author=Ali Ansari, Daniel Berman and Thomas Rintoul|publisher=Chatham House and the Institute of Iranian Studies, University of St Andrews|accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| More than 100%
|In two Conservative provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, a turnout of ''more than 100%'' was recorded.&lt;ref name=&quot;chatham&quot;/&gt;
|-
| No swing
|At a provincial level, there is no correlation between the increased turnout, and the swing to Ahmadinejad.&lt;ref name=&quot;chatham&quot;/&gt; This challenges the notion that his victory was due to the massive participation of a previously silent Conservative majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;chatham&quot;/&gt;
|-
| Reformist votes
|In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, and all former centrist voters, and all new voters, but ''also took up to 44% of former Reformist voters'', despite a decade of conflict between these two groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;chatham&quot;/&gt;
|-
| Rural votes
|In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and Ahmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas. The claim that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces in 2009 flies in the face of these trends.&lt;ref name=&quot;chatham&quot;/&gt;
|}

In response, a report was authored by [[Reza Esfandiari]] and [[Yousef Bozorgmehr]] that concluded the Chatham House report to be flawed - their analysis suggested that the results of the election comport to a natural outcome, allowing for the possibility of some fraud at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wepapers.com/Papers/52959/Report_on_the_Iranian_presidential_election_2009 wepapers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
{{Main|Timeline of the 2009 Iranian election protests}}

On Saturday 13 June after election results announced that Ahmadinejad had won, supporters of Mousavi took to the streets to protest. The next day, protests grew, as did violence. On the night of 14 June the pro-Ahmadinejad [[Basij]] paramilitary group raided Tehran University, injuring many. On 15 June millions of protesters marched on Azadi street and Mousavi made his first post-election appearance.

On 16 June, protests continued, and the [[Guardian Council]] announced a partial recount would be conducted; however, the vote was not annulled. On Wednesday 17 June another large protest occurred; some members of the [[Iranian national football team]] wore green wristbands in support of Mousavi during their game against South Korea. On Thursday, 18 June more than 100,000 protesters held a candlelight vigil in Tehran following Mousavi's call for a day of mourning for those killed in protests. The Guardian Council invited the three major challengers to meet to discuss their grievances.

On Friday, 19 June Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini spoke during religious services, saying the election was legitimate called the large voter turnout and resulting victory (for Ahmadinejad) a &quot;divine assessment&quot; and protests would no longer be tolerated. However, the opposition did not accept this, and the protests occurred albeit on a smaller scale. The next day, 20 June fewer protesters took to streets. At the protests that did occur, said to number in the tens of thousands of people, much violence occurred, causing many would-be protesters to stay in their homes the next day, Sunday, 21 June. On 20 June a young Iranian woman, identified as [[Neda Agha-Soltan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=[[French language|french]]|publisher=egoblog.net|title=Her name was Neda|url=http://egoblog.net/2009/06/21/her-name-was-neda/ | accessdate = 21 June 2009| date = 21 June 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ibz2nxSW|archivedate=2009-07-28|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shot by the [[Basij]] and died in front of cameras on Kargar Avenue in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=[[English language|english]]|publisher=BreakForNews.com|title=Unidentified Woman Shot Dead in Karegar Ave - 20 June 2009|url=http://breakfornews.com/KarekarAveShooting090620.htm | accessdate = 20 June 2009| date = 20 June 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ibz44O18|archivedate=2009-07-28|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly graphic amateur videos of the killing rapidly spread [[Viral video|virally]] across the internet after being posted to [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=[[English language|english]]|publisher=[[Youtube]]|title=Basij shots to a young woman in Tehran's Saturday 20 June protests|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=185vPe_gROA&amp;feature=channel_page | accessdate = 20 June 2009| date = 20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June riot police broke up the main rally in Tehran with tear gas and live fire into the air.

During Friday, prayers broadcast live on television on 26 June [[Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami]] is reported to have said that &quot;''Anybody who fights against the Islamic system or the leader of Islamic society, fight him until complete destruction''&quot;. and called for the execution of leading demonstrators as they are &quot;''people who wage war against God''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6583797.ece | accessdate = 2009-06-27 | location=London | work=The Times | first=Martin | last=Fletcher | title=Leading demonstrators must be executed Ayatollah Khatami demands | date=2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, 29 June 2009, the Guardian Council certified the results of the controversial election.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran Council Certifies Disputed Election Results|author=Michael Slackman|date=29 June 2009|accessdate=29 June 2009|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set off a wave of protests, disregarding the Iranian government's ban on street marches.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt; The Iranian intelligence chief alleged that western and &quot;Zionist&quot; forces were responsible for inciting the protests. Four of the nine British officials arrested on 28 June 2009 remain in custody under those charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt;

Late July, protest had reportedly entered a &quot;Phase II&quot;, using tactics such as the boycott of goods advertised on state-controlled television; attempting to deny power to state-run TV evening news broadcasts by turning on all electric appliances just before the news; &quot;blitz&quot; street demonstrations &quot;lasting just long enough to chant `Death to the dictator!` several times&quot;, but not long enough for security forces to arrive; identifying paramilitary [[Basij]] vigilantes linked to the crackdown and putting marks in the opposition color green, or pictures of protest victims in front of their homes; scribbled anti-regime slogans on money. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The new protest is reportedly based on the idea of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] that &quot;even the most powerful cannot rule without the cooperation of the ruled.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912941,00.html?xid=rss-world | work=Time | first=Robin | last=Wright | title=Iran's Protesters: Phase 2 of Their Feisty Campaign | date=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term as President of Iran in an official inauguration in Tehran. Protests were held outside the Parliament during the inauguration, with protesters chanting &quot;death to the dictator&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/world/52524657.html|title=Ahmadinejad sworn in as Iran president amid crisis|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=5 August 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major protests would continue after the inauguration as well. Among the largest were protests which were held on Iranian holidays, such as [[Quds Day]] on 18 September, [[13th of Aban]] on 4 November and [[Students Day (Iran)|Iranian Students Day]] on 7 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/asie-pacifique/article/2009/09/19/l-opposition-iranienne-reaffirme-son-existence-lors-de-la-journee-d-al-qods_1242479_3216.html|title=Lâopposition iranienne rÃ©affirme son existence lors de la journÃ©e dâAl-Qods|author=Marie-Claude Decamps|date=2009 09 18|publisher=Lemonde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/04/iran-protests-embassy-30th-anniversary|title=Iran protesters hijack 30th anniversary of US embassy seizure|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2009 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Black | date=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The families of those who died were allegedly subjected to penalties and bureaucratic [[red tape]], such as being asked to sign paperwork that they do not have complaints against the government prior to being allowed to claim bodies.

Former chairman of Iranian parliament [[Mehdi Karroubi]] stated that male and female prisoners have been raped in the prison and their genitals were torn but it is not proved yet. He asked the head of the assembly to investigate the issue in a letter to the head of [[Assembly of Experts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1494473.php/Opposition-party-leader-claims-sexual-abuse-in-Iranian-prisons|title=Opposition party leader claims sexual abuse in Iranian prisons|accessdate=9 August 2009|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED AUTHOR --&gt;|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1250474094162277|archivedate=2009-08-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's police chief, Gen.

Additionally, several of the detained died while in prison.

Iranian film maker [[Reza Allamehzadeh]] made a documentary about Azar Al-Kanan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azar Ale-Kanan &amp;#124; Iranian.com &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://iranian.com/main/2009/aug/azar-ale-kanan|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5j6930NAT|archivedate=2009-08-17|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent Iranian human rights activist and former political prisoner in Iran who became one of the victims of torture, sexual abuse, and finally, rape. The documentary was released after ex-chairman of Iranian parliament Mehdi Karroubi called for investigation of sexual abuse of protesters in prisons by Iranian police and the judicial system, both under the responsibility of the Supreme Leader. Karroubi's letter angered conservatives and the head of Iranian parliament ''Ali Larijani'' and senior cleric and representative of the supreme leader, [[Ahmad Khatami]] denied the reports of sexual abuse. Following the denials, on August 16, 2009, [[Fereshteh Ghazi]], in an article in Rooz, wrote her story and described the torture and sexual violence in Iranian prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ØªÚ©Ø§Ù Ø¯ÙÙØ¯Ù ØªØ± Ø§Ø² Ø¯Ø±ÙØº - roozonline.com &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article////107/-1738c4bd99.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1250914961103697|archivedate=2009-08-22|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June, [[Belgium|Belgian]] national television reporter Jef Lambrecht from the [[Flanders|Flemish]] public television broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] and his sound technician, were arrested in Tehran. They had been doing a story on the riots, and had gotten caught in the middle of the violence. While Lambrechts had taken a punch, Vandervorst was arrested by riot police. When Lambrecht went to check where Vandervorst was being taken, he was promptly arrested as well. Both were taken to the Ministry of Information and detained in the basement. They were both released after two hours with strict instructions not to make any photos or film recordings of the protests. At the same time, two Dutch reporters from Nova were also arrested and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VRT-reporter opgepakt in woelig Teheran|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=LO2BDPIV|language=Dutch|date=2009-06-15|publisher=[[Het Nieuwsblad]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ic2uaN8l|archivedate=2009-07-28|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their faces have been obscured in the TV broadcasts which the newspaper claims, after speaking to witnesses, is due to facial bruising resulting from torture whilst in custody including several instances of male rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/dominic_lawson/article6638036.ece | accessdate = 2009-07-05 | location=London | work=The Times | first=Dominic | last=Lawson | title=Irans British stooges are staring right at you | date=2009-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign involvement==
In 2006, the United States congress passed the [[Iran Freedom and Support Act]] which directed $10 million towards groups opposed to the Iranian Government.

In 2007, [[ABC news]] reported that U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] had authorized a $400 million CIA covert operation to destabilize Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bush Authorizes New Covert Action Against Iran - The Blotter &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2007/05/bush_authorizes.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jc8E5JNQ|archivedate=2009-09-07|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George W. Bush signed a &quot;nonlethal presidential finding&quot; that puts into motion a CIA plan that reportedly includes a coordinated campaign of propaganda, disinformation and manipulation of Iran's currency and international financial transactions.

In 2008, journalist [[Seymour M. Hersh]] reported in [[The New Yorker]] that &quot; Congress agreed to a request from President Bush to fund a major escalation of covert operations against Iran&quot; and &quot;the President sought up to four hundred million dollars, were described in a Presidential Finding signed by Bush, and are designed to destabilize the countryâs religious leadership.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hersh |first=Seymour M. |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/07/080707fa_fact_hersh |title=The Bush Administrationâs operations in Iran |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the U.S. [[Foreign Policy Journal]], the question of whether there was U.S. involvement in fomenting unrest during the election was: &quot;given the record of U.S. interference in the state affairs of Iran and clear policy of regime change, it certainly seems possible, even likely, that the U.S. had a significant role to play in helping to bring about the recent turmoil in an effort to undermine the government of the Islamic Republic.&quot; The article also quoted evidence concerning interference by the U.S. based [[Twitter]], asserting that âin terms of involving the huge [[Iranian diaspora]] and everyone else with a grudge against Ahmadinejad, it has been very successful.â&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Policy Journal 23 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2009, [[Haaretz]] reported that Israeli foreign ministry was organizing a public relations campaign 'to show the world that Iran is not a Western democracy'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Israeli diplomats told to take offensive in PR war against Iran | work = Haaretz  | date = 1 June 2009  | url = http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israeli-diplomats-told-to-take-offensive-in-pr-war-against-iran-1.277025}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On 26 August 2009, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei released a statement through Iranian state television. He said that although he did not believe opposition leaders were working as agents of foreign governments, he did believe that the protests were organized and planned, possibly without the knowledge of the Iranian political opposition. He said that &quot;This plot was defeated, since fortunately our enemies still do not understand the issue in Iran&quot;, specifically pointing to foreign involvement in the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Iranian protesters 'not agents' | work = BBC News  | language =  | publisher =   | date = 27 August 2009  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8223606.stm  | accessdate = 30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Khamenei: 'No proof' of chaos plot | work = Al Jazeera English  | language =  | publisher =   | date = 27 August 2009  | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2009/08/200982784942708215.html  | accessdate = 30 August 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jc8ETNRd|archivedate=2009-09-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 June the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' quoted two Iranian protesters who stated that &quot;Palestinian forces&quot; (which the article states are members of [[Hamas]]) were working with the Basij in helping crush the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1245184851049&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull |title=Protesters tell &quot;Post' Hamas helping Iran crush dissent |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2009-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Jerusalem-based reporter for [[WorldNet Daily]] asked multiple Hamas officials to comment on this accusation, including spokesman Fawzi Barhoum, parliamentarian Mushir-al-Masri, and top Gaza political advisor [[Ahmed Yousef]].

On Muslim cable TV show Ali Mallah, Vice President of the [[Canadian Arab Federation]] (CAF) endorsed the election of President [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]] and stated that Western governments, âstarting with the US and Franceâ had been working to unseat Ahmedinejad, and further criticized the âdehumanizing Ahmedinejad in the ugliest terms.â Mallah stated that âThey [Western media] were really preparing the stage to really distort the truth about the outcome of the result even before the election was announced and that shows their questionable interests.â Finally, Mallah accused Western internet service providers of aiding and helping the Iranian opposition, claiming that âThe videos and emails coming from inside Tehran are being supported by [American] Internet Service Providers.â&lt;ref name=AverroesPress1&gt;[http://www.averroespress.com/AverroesPress/Main/Entries/2009/7/1_As_Canadians_celebrate_National_Holiday%2C_Canadian_Arab_Federation_VP_says%2C_%E2%80%9CF__k_Canada_Day%E2%80%9D.html An Arab Canadianâs way of celebrating Canada Day], by Tarek Fatah, Averroespress, July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Canadaday&gt;[http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/07/01/barbara-kay-it-is-time-for-the-anti-canadian-arab-federation-to-fold-its-tents.aspx Barbara Kay, It is time for the (Anti) Canadian Arab Federation to fold its tents] by Barbara Kay, National Post, July 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Neda Agha-Soltan.jpg|thumb|[[Neda Soltan]], a woman killed by [[Basij]] on June 20]] --&gt;
A bystander, [[Neda Agha-Soltan]], who was killed by authorities, has been mythologised by the opposition as a [[shaheed|martyr]]. The status of a martyr is revered in Shia Islam. To prevent this from happening, the authorities have tried to call off [[janaza|funeral services]] for her, which according to Shia Islam, must be held on the third, seventh and 40th day after the martyr's passing. Robert Tait and Matthew Weaver of the Guardian noted that it was [[funeral procession]]s on the 40th day of [[mourning]] of fallen protesters in 1979 that created momentum in toppling the [[Pahlavi dynasty|shah's regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How Neda Soltani became the face of Iran's struggle|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/22/neda-soltani-death-iran|author=Robert Tait and Matthew Weaver | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2009-06-22 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of martyrdom resonates deeply amongst the Shiite Muslim population of Iran. The Shiite faith was founded on the idea of self-sacrifice in the cause of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Latest Updates on Iranâs Disputed Election|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/22/latest-updates-on-irans-disputed-election-3/?apage=5|publisher=New York Times|author=Robert Mackey | date=2009-06-22 | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
