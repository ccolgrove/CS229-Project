The '''2011 Djiboutian protests''' were widespread protests and riots in the Muslim nation of [[Djibouti]], starting in January 2011 and continuing through to March. Djibouti is a member of the [[Arab League]] due to [[Arabic language|Arabic]] being a co-official language, but it is not an [[Arab people|Arab]]-majority country; however, protests showed a clear [[Impact of the Arab Spring|influence]] from the [[Arab Spring]] in [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. The protests have ended after mass arrests&lt;ref name=afrol/&gt; and barring of international observers&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=arf/&gt;

==Background==
President of Djibouti [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] has been in office since 1999, but his government has been in power for 34 years. Recently, Guelleh changed the constitution so that he could have a third term in office. This proved unpopular with the Djiboutian population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/mar/06/af-djibouti-protests/ Police, army forces in Djibouti prevent protest - Sunday, March 6, 2011 | 3:02 a.m. - Las Vegas Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

These protests occurred in the months leading up to the [[Djiboutian presidential election, 2011]].

==Protests==
===Before February 19===
On January 28, hundreds of people turned out to protest in Djibouti City. Similar to the events on January 28, only smaller. 300 people gathered in a square in the capital, [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]].&lt;ref name=&quot;somalilandpress&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=People in Djibouti protest against President Gelleh|author=|newspaper=Somalilandpress|date=|url=http://somalilandpress.com/people-in-djibouti-protest-againts-president-gelleh-19925|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 18, thousands rallied against the president, gathering at a stadium with the intention of staying there until their demands were met. However, the demonstration escalated into clashes after dusk, as police used batons and tear gas against stone-throwing protesters. Officials from the Union for Democratic Change, an umbrella group of three opposition parties, gave speeches at the demonstration calling for Guelleh to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Djiboutians rally to oust president|author=|publisher=[[Aljazeera English]]|date=18 February 2011|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/201121816513686216.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===February 19â25===
On February 19, clashes were reported to be intensifying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view/20110219-321179/Djibouti-police-protestors-face-off-for-second-day |title=Djibouti police, protestors face off for second day |publisher=INQUIRER.net |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-government protestors clashed with security forces 24 hours after hundreds of demonstrators demanding the president step down hurled stones at riot police who fired back with tear gas. At least one policeman was killed, and sources said one protester had also been killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Middle-East-Unrest-Bloody-Clashes-Between-Protesters-And-Police-Claim-Dozens-Of-Lives/Article/201102315936935?lpos=World_News_Carousel_Region_0&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15936935_Middle_East_Unrest:_Bloody_Clashes_Between_Protesters_And_Police_Claim_Dozens_Of_Lives |title=Middle East Unrest: Bloody Clashes Between Protesters And Police Claim Dozens Of Lives |publisher=Sky News |date=|accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest leaders were arrested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/19/us-djibouti-protests-idUSTRE71I1BQ20110219 | work=Reuters | title=Protests hit Djibouti as opposition leaders held | date=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Djiboutian authorities released three opposition leaders as opponents of President Ismail Guelleh clashed with police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-19/djibouti-opposition-leaders-free-after-anti-government-protests.html Djibouti Opposition Leaders Free After Anti-Government Protests - Businessweek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the Djiboutian civil rights movements, opposition parties and protest organisers were set to meet on February 24 to plan mass protests for the following day. Police acting on behalf of Gulleh arrested 300 organisers during and after the mass protests on February 18, with reports of torture being used to sedate the activists. After the failure of the leaders to turn up on February 24, opposition leader [[Bourhan Mohammed Ali]] stated he feared the protests had lost momentum.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol&quot;&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/37449 afrol News - Mass arrests stopped further Djibouti protests&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Protests had been planned for March 4, but it remained to be seen if the Djiboutians would be able to coordinate themselves without the 300 arrested leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol&quot; /&gt;

===February 26 - March 11===
On March 3, [[Djibouti]] ordered its opposition party to cancel its anti-government protests which were to be held on March 4, 2011 due to a previous rally a month earlier turning violent.  [[Mohammed Daoud]], head of the opposition [[Djibouti Party for Development]], said that protests will occur as scheduled.&lt;ref name=&quot;reutersPostponeProtest&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://af.reuters.com/article/djiboutiNews/idAFLDE7220AJ20110303 | title=Djibouti orders opposition to postpone protest | accessdate=4 March 2011 | author=Reporting by Abdourahem Arteh in Djibouti and Richard Lough in Nairobi; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by David Clarke | publisher=Reuters | date=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 4th soldiers and police filled the streets to prevent the planned demonstration blocking the route to the city's main stadium where they were to have taken place and preventing the protest.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; A protest was planned for March 11, but security forces scuppered the protest and detained 4 opposition leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-11/djibouti-forces-arrest-opposition-leaders-scuppering-protests.html |title=Djibouti Forces Arrest Opposition Leaders, Scuppering Protests |publisher=[[Bloomberg Television|Bloomberg.com]] |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
