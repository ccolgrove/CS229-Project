==Background==
Sancho received his [[Associate of Arts|A.A. degree]] from [[Valencia Community College]] in 1973. He then received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Social Science]] from [[Stetson University]] in 1978. Sancho completed his education with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Florida State University College of Law]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon County Supervisor of Elections&quot;&gt;[http://www.leonfl.org/elect/?page=General%20Information/MeetTheSupervisor.asp Leon County Supervisor of Elections]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 Sancho, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], was the Leon County leader for Presidential candidate [[Gary Hart]].

He's a former staff member of the [[Florida House of Representatives]], Corrections, Probation &amp; Parole Committee. He is a member of the [http://www.cfpa.org/ Center for Policy Alternatives], Voter Participation Advisory Board and member of The Elections Center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon County Supervisor of Elections&quot;/&gt;

==Supervisor of Elections==
After a bid as county commissioner in 1986 Sancho took courses in election machine management and became certified in their use. In November 1988, Sancho was elected to his first term as the Supervisor of Elections for Leon County, Florida. He ran and was re-elected in 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2004, serving his fifth term as of January 2, 2005. He was unopposed in each election since 1992.

==National recognition==
In the [[United States presidential election, 2000 Florida results|2000 presidential recount]], Sancho (No Party Affiliation) was chosen to lead the Florida hand count of ballots in dispute in [[Miami-Dade County]]. The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] stopped the hand count in a 5-4 ruling just as it got underway.

''(Most voters (99%) in Leon County use the opti-scan equipment, but [[federal law]] requires one [[Electronic voting|electronic machine]] per [[voting precinct|precinct]] for [[visually impaired]] voters).''

==Hacking a Diebold machine==
In 2005, Sancho invited [[Bev Harris]], founder of [[Black Box Voting]], [[Kathleen Wynne]], Black Box Voting Associate Director, [[Harri Hursti]], computer programmer and security expert, [[Herbert Hugh Thompson|Dr. Hugh Thompson]], application security expert and Ph.D. in math, [[Susan Bernecker]], former [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] candidate for [[New Orleans]] city council and [[Susan Pynchon]], Director of [[Florida Fair Elections Coalition]] to Tallahassee. There, they performed what is now known as the [[Hursti Hack]] which became the center piece of an [[HBO]] documentary titled [[Hacking Democracy]].

===Results of Sancho's actions===
As a result, Diebold, [[Election Systems &amp; Software]] and [[Sequoia Voting Systems]], the only 3 companies certified to do business in Florida would not sell Sancho voting machines.  [http://www.automarkts.com/ Automark] was contacted by Sancho but the Secretary of State would not certify their voting equipment. ES&amp;S said, &quot;did not believe it could have a smooth working relationship with Sancho&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In Florida, [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia County]] joined Leon County in dumping Diebold. Elections officials in the states of [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], [[Texas]], and [[California]]  have called into question the security and accuracy of new voting machines.
{{Quotation|&quot;I'm very troubled by this, to be honestâI can't believe the way he's being treated. What kind of message is this sending to elections supervisors? &quot;The federal certification process for voting machines is broken, sadly, when it comes to security. It was designed for the era of mechanical machines, and it hasn't kept up.&quot;|David Wagner, computer scientist, the [[University of California]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Opposition==
After the test election, Secretary of State Sue Cobb [[Republican Party (United States)|(R)]] accused Sancho of &quot;undermining voter confidence&quot; and the Federal Government and demanded the return of a $564,000 in grant money given to Sancho through the state to purchase voting machines that would comply with ADA standards as mandated in the '''Help America Vote Act''' {{USPL|107|252}} (HAVA), a [[United States federal law]] passed on October 29, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridatrend.com/law_article.asp?cName=Law%20and%20Government&amp;rName=Public%20Policy&amp;whatID=3&amp;aID=42719405.2161421.592644.4481734.7456709.309&amp;aID2=45579 Florida Trend, Law and Government]&lt;/ref&gt;

At Leon County Commission meetings on February 14 and February 28, 2006 the only two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in the local governments of either the city of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]] or Leon County government, Tony Grippa and Ed Depuy of Leon County's seven-member county commission blasted Sancho for failing to provide Leon County with accessible voting machines in attacks that Sancho believes were politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvweb.clerk.leon.fl.us/finance/board_minutes/minutes/regular/2006/060228.html Minutes of the Leon County Commission - February 14, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Leon County Commission meeting on February 28, 2006, county staff revealed that Chuck Owen, Division Counsel for Diebold Election Systems, met with county staff behind closed doors on February 27. According to staff, Owen stated that Diebold would sell its touch-screen voting machines to the county if, and only if, the county removed Supervisor Sancho from office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvweb.clerk.leon.fl.us/finance/board_minutes/minutes/regular/2006/060228.html Minutes of the Leon County Commission - February 28, 3006]&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, Commissioner DePuy offered a motion, seconded by Commissioner Grippa to request the [[State Attorney]] to convene a [[grand jury]] to investigate why Leon County is not in compliance with the voting regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvweb.clerk.leon.fl.us/finance/board_minutes/minutes/regular/2006/060228.html Minutes of the Leon County Commission, February 28, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Grippa left the Leon County Commission in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peerreviewflorida.com/fl/2006/07/tallahassee_and.html Peer Review Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; Ed DePuy was defeated in 2008 by Democrat Akin Akinyemi.

==Legal action==
On March 8, 2006 Sancho initiated [[legal proceeding]]s against Diebold Election Systems for [[breach of contract]]. Attorney Lida Rodriguez Taseff with [[Duane Morris]] in Miami filed the suit. Diebold refused to return phone calls to Sancho and staff, refused to honor its existing contract with Leon County for the maintenance and upgrades of its voting system. Further, Diebold refused to sell Leon County touch-screen voting machines to meet state and [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] requirements for [[disabled]] accessibility.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
