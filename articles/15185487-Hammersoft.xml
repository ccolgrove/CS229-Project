[[Image:BearsPanthers.jpg|225px|right|thumb|Kyle Orton handing the ball off to Matt FortÃ©]]
Coming off their upset road win over the Colts, the Bears flew to [[Bank of America Stadium]] for a Week 2 intraconference duel with the [[Carolina Panthers]].  In the first quarter, Chicago struck first as WR [[Brandon Lloyd]] returned a blocked punt 9 yards for a touchdown.  In the second quarter, the Bears added on to their lead as kicker [[Robbie Gould]] got a 26-yard field goal.  The Panthers would respond with kicker [[John Kasay]] getting a 37-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Chicago added on to its lead with FB [[Jason McKie]] getting a 1-yard TD run.  However, Carolina started to rally as Kasay nailed a 45-yard field goal, along with RB [[Jonathan Stewart]] getting a 4-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Panthers closed out its game-winning rally with Stewart getting a 1-yard TD run.

With the loss, the Bears fell to 1-1.
