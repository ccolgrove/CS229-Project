==History==
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
[[Image:Kennesaw State University Village Apt.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Image of the University Village at dusk.]]

The university has undergone a number of changes in name (and mission) over its relatively short existence. 

===1963===

The university was officially founded on October 9, 1963, when the [[Georgia Board of Regents]] approved the establishment of a junior college tentatively to be named [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]] [[Junior college|Junior College]].  In December 1964, [[Horace Sturgis]] was designated to serve as the future college's first president.  When the school opened it was named ''Kennesaw Junior College'' opened in fall of 1966 with an initial enrollment of 1,014 students. &lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.kennesaw.edu/history.shtml &quot;KSU: History&quot;],. Retrieved on 2011-02-24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===1976: Kennesaw College===


Ten years later, in 1976, the former Kennesaw Junior College became a four-year college and was redesignated ''Kennesaw College''.

===1981-2006: Betty Siegel era===

In 1981 [[Betty Siegel]], known as &quot;The Betty&quot; to many people,  became the second president of KSU and the first female university president in the University System of Georgia.&lt;ref name='bizjournals'&gt;{{cite news | first=Jan | last=Costello | coauthors= | title=Betty Siegel brings out the best in people and places | date=2001-03-30 | publisher=[[American City Business Journals, Inc]] | url =http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2001/04/02/focus1.html | work =Atlanta Business Chronicle | pages = 2 | accessdate = 2007-12-18 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Isakson'&gt;{{cite news | first=Johnny | last=Isakson | coauthors= | title=Floor Statement Congratulating Dr. Betty Siegel | date=2001-05-26 | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | url =http://isakson.senate.gov/floor/2005/052605siegel.htm | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-18 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s to mid 1990s, KSU began a period of rapid growth, including a program of expanded offerings, as well as residential housing.

In 1985, KSU initiated its first [[Graduate student#US|graduate degree]] programs, in business and education.

====1988: Kennesaw State College====

In 1988, the former Kennesaw College was renamed ''Kennesaw State College'' and [[Associate degree]]s were discontinued, except for a program in [[nursing]].

In 1990, the [[Coles College of Business]] started the nation's first degree program in professional sales, which is today ranked among the best.

====1996: Kennesaw State University====

In 1996, Kennesaw State's [[College World Series#Division II|baseball]] and [[NCAA Softball Championship|softball]] teams won the [[NCAA Division II]] national championships.  The winning Owls continued excelling in athletics including the Lady Owls 2003 win of the NCAA Women's Division II Soccer Championship and the men's basketball team win of the 2004 [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship]].  In part due to their winning Division II in 2005, the Owls joined Division I and the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]].

In 1998, the nursing program began offering options for clinical practice abroad. Practicums in Haiti were started by Dr. [[GerÃ³nimo Lluberas]].&lt;ref&gt;Â«Comprehensive Program Review Self-Study for the M.S.N. Program in the [[WellStar]] Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Program,&quot;School of Nursing, College of Health and Human Services, Kennesaw State University, 2002-2003, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, KSU was recognized by the Department of Homeland Security and the National Security Agency as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education.  At the time, this placed KSU among 67 other institutions recognized as CAE/IAEs with this recognition.  KSU was re-recognized in 2007.  For information on the CAE/IAE program visit the NSA web site (www.nsa.gov). &lt;rf name=âCAEIAEâ&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.nsa.gov/ia/academic_outreach/nat_cae/index.shtml |title=NSA CAE/IAE |accessdate=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2004, the USG Board of Regents approved the Bachelor of Science in Information Security and Assurance, the first degree program of its kind at a public university in the Southeast, and only the second degree program of its kind in the U.S.

In 2006, Dr. Siegel stepped down as one of the longest-serving woman university presidents in American history.  The Siegel era was marked by exponential growth and advancement for the university.

===2006-present: Daniel Papp era===

In the summer of 2006, Dr. [[Daniel S. Papp]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]], became the university's third president.&lt;ref name=&quot;president&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/president/ |title=Office of the President |accessdate=2007-04-04 |last=Papp |first=Daniel |publisher=Kennesaw State University }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Arlethia | last=Perry-Johnson | coauthors= | title=Papp Named President of Kennesaw State University | date=2006-02-16 | publisher=[[University System of Georgia]] | url =http://www.usg.edu/news/2006/021606.phtml | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-04-04 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070211072615/http://www.usg.edu/news/2006/021606.phtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the university is mostly non-traditionally aged and commuter students, there has been a renewed effort to become a more traditional campus.&lt;ref name='capital'&gt;{{cite news | first=AIXA | last=PASCUAL | coauthors= | title= KSU launches $75 million capital campaign | date=2007-10-27 | publisher= | url =http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/cobb/stories/2007/10/26/ksu_1027.html | work =Atlanta Journal and Constitution | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-31 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071029140331/http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/cobb/stories/2007/10/26/ksu_1027.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='feasibility'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=KSU Athletics Feasibility Study | date=2007-06-01 | publisher=Kennesaw State University | url =http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/kenn/genrel/auto_pdf/feasibilitystudy | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-31 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Papp's first strategic plan outlined initiatives to lead to an increase in academic standards and retention rates, and more on-campus housing.

In the Spring semester of 2007, KSU started its first doctoral programs in Education in Leadership for Learning and Education.&lt;ref name='ed'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/education/grad/edd/index.html |title=Graduate Studies |accessdate=2007-10-31 |publisher=Kennesaw State University Enterprise Information Management }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fall semester of 2007, a new {{convert|162595|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} Social Sciences building opened for use by many of the [[Kennesaw State University College of Humanities and Social Sciences|College of Humanities and Social Sciences]] students.  Adjacent to the building, a {{convert|35000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} sculpture entitled &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot;, created by Finnish artist [[Eino]], collapsed in December 2006, three months after installation on campus.  The sculpture was intended to be a permanent reminder to future generations to take care of their delicate planet.  Ironically, the statue was made from quartzite strip-mined within the Brazilian [[Rain forest]].&lt;ref name='Birth'&gt;{{cite news | first=Angela | last=Hill | coauthors= | title=175-ton East Bay-inspired 'Earth Spaceship' needs landing pad | date=2007-03-24 | publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =Alameda Times-Star | pages = | accessdate = 2007-11-28 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconstruction of the statue was completed on 26 October 2007.

On October 17, 2007, [[Apollo 16]] astronaut [[Charles Duke]] donated several relics from the 1972 lunar mission to Kennesaw State, including a lunar map and a checklist from the flight. It was reported to be the only checklist from an Apollo flight to be in a university library anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name='moon'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/library/duke/collection.htm |title=From the Moon to the Manuscript: The Charles Duke Donation - About the Collection |accessdate=2008-01-24 |work=Horace W. Sturgis Library |publisher=Kennesaw State University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2008, the Board of Regents approved the university system's only [[Doctor of Business Administration]], which was also Kennesaw State's second doctoral degree.&lt;ref name='dba'&gt;{{cite news | first=Karen | last=Rosen | coauthors= | title=KSU adds doctoral degree in business, major in dance | date=2008-03-19 | publisher=[[Cox Newspapers]] | url =http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/cobb/stories/2008/03/19/ksu_0319.html | work =The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regents also approved a Bachelors of Arts with a major in Dance, KSU's 46th undergraduate degree, as well as a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) Secondary Science degree.&lt;ref name='dba' /&gt;

Damage to the campus from the [[2009 Georgia floods]] forced administration to cancel classes from September 21â23, 2009.

== Campus ==
Kennesaw State University is located on {{convert|240|acre|ha|lk=out}} of land adjacent to [[Interstate 75|I-75]] (similar to three other Georgia universities, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], [[Dalton State College]] and [[Georgia State University]]) where views of the campus can be seen from the highway, including Kennesaw State's &quot;University Village&quot;.

====Spaceship Earth====
{{main|Spaceship Earth (Sculpture)}}
Located adjacent to the Social Sciences Building is a {{convert|350000|lb|kg|adj=on}} sculpture entitled &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot;, created by Finnish American artist [http://www.eino.org Eino].  The sculpture was commissioned by the Maxwell Family Foundation in memory of the late environmentalist [[David Brower]].  The sculpture was intended to be a permanent reminder to future generations to take care of their delicate planet.

In late December 2006, only three months after installation on campus, the structure collapsed.  After the collapse, Eino attributed the disaster to vandalism, but later reports that surfaced associated the collapse to poor construction.

Reconstruction was to have begun in February 2007, but was delayed until July 2007, and was finally completed on October 26, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savespaceshipearth.com Save Spaceship Earth Alliance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Video feed.
