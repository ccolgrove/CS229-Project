'''VirtualDub''' is a [[video capture]] and [[video processing]] utility for [[Microsoft Windows]] written by Avery Lee.

It is designed to process linear video streams, including filtering and recompression.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = VirtualDub features | url = http://www.virtualdub.org/features.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  VirtualDub was originally created for the purpose of compressing [[anime]] videos of [[Sailor Moon]].&lt;ref name=alee&gt;[http://www.virtualdub.org/virtualdub_history.html VirtualDub history - virtualdub.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Released under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]], VirtualDub is [[free software]].

==Features==

VirtualDub operates on [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] files, requiring that appropriate video and audio [[codec]]s are installed.

===Video capture and creation===

VirtualDub has digital and analog capture capabilities. It supports both [[DirectShow]] &amp; [[Video for Windows]] capture.

Capture features include capture to any AVI variant, audio VU meters, overlay and preview modes, histogram, selectable crop area, video noise reduction, auto stop settings (based on capture time, file size, free space, and/or dropped frames), and designate alternate drive(s) for capture overflow. VirtualDub can also help overcome a common problem with digital cameras that also record video. Many models, especially Canon, record in an [[M-JPEG]] format that is virtually incompatible with some [[NLE]] programs, such as Vegas 6.0 and 7.0; simply saving such an AVI file as an &quot;old-style AVI&quot; in File allows the video to appear in Vegas.

VirtualDub supports DV capture from Type 2 (VfW) [[FireWire]] controllers only (capture will not work with Type 1).  There is no DV batch capture, still image capture, or DV device control capability.

VirtualDub can also be used to create a video file from a series of [[BMP file format|bitmap]]s or [[Truevision TGA|targa]]s. This requires that individual frames are given file names numbered in sequential order without any gaps (e.g. 001.bmp, 002.bmp, 003.bmp...). From those, the frame rate can be adjusted, and other modifications such as the addition of a [[sound track]] can be made.

===Editing===

VirtualDub can be used to delete segments of a video file, append new segments, or reorder existing segments. However, segments of different files cannot be mixed, and no transition effects can be applied.

VirtualDub comes with a number of [[filter (software)|filter]]s. Examples include reducing the video size by half, converting the video to [[grayscale]], arbitrary rotation and about a dozen more. Plugin filters further extend VirtualDub's capabilities. A filter [[SDK]] is available for developers to create their own video and audio filters.&lt;ref name=sdk&gt;[http://www.virtualdub.org/filtersdk.html VirtualDub SDK]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to applying filters, entire image sequences can be saved to [[hard disk]] as [[Windows bitmap|BMP]] or [[truevision TGA|TGA]] files, which may be later modified. In addition, the sound track can be extracted from a video, and modifications made to it; filters can be applied before the track is spliced back in. Frame sequences and sound tracks must be edited in external software programs.

==Past legal issues==

Early versions of VirtualDub supported importing of [[Microsoft]]'s [[Advanced Systems Format|&lt;tt&gt;ASF&lt;/tt&gt;]] file format, but this was removed in version 1.3d following an informal phone call from a Microsoft employee claiming that it infringed one of Microsoft's [[patent]]s. Microsoft never identified any specific patent numbers that it believed to have been infringed, but speculation by others is that {{Cite patent|US|6041345}} might be relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advogato.org/article/101.html Advogato: Microsoft patents ASF media file format, stops reverse engineering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2006, VirtualDub's German users who hosted copies of VirtualDub, or even linked to them on their web pages, began receiving [[Abmahnung|cease and desist letters]] from a private individual that claimed to have German [[trademark|word mark]] on &quot;VirtualDub&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=124 Illicit word mark registered on &quot;VirtualDub&quot; in Germany - virtualdub.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However this issue has been solved: the word mark in Germany has been deleted&lt;ref&gt;[http://register.dpma.de/DPMAregister/marke/register/2009117/306018772/DE Official status of German word mark 30601877 &quot;VIRTUALDUB&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and an injunction has been granted against the former owner of said word mark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=129 &quot;Preliminary injunction granted in regard to German word mark VIRTUALDUB&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
VirtualDub is [[free software]], released under the [[GNU General Public License]] and hosted on [[SourceForge.net]].

[[File:VirtualDubMod in Wine.png|right|thumb|400px|The VirtualDubMod, a popular fork of this software, looking very similar to the original.]]

VirtualDub has spawned a number of [[fork (software development)|forks]], one being the now abandoned [[VirtualDubMod]], which was claimed to include extra features not in Avery Lee's version â such as support for [[MPEG-2]] and [[Ogg Media]].{{Who|date=November 2009|reason=need source that verifies and explains in what way these features were present}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualdubmod/ |title=VirtualDubMod |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;afterdawn-vdm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afterdawn.com/software/video_software/video_tools/virtualdubmod.cfm |title=VirtualDubMod v1.5.10.2 |author=AfterDawn.com |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;virtualdubmod-videohelp&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videohelp.com/tools/VirtualdubMOD |title=VirtualdubMOD |author=VideoHelp.com |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; VirtualDubMod is a unification of three projects/forks: VirtualDub-MPEG2, VirtualDubOGM, VirtualDubAVS and more.&lt;ref name=&quot;afterdawn-vdm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;virtualdubmod-videohelp&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.free-codecs.com/download/VirtualDubMod.htm |title=VirtualdubMod 1.5.10.2 |author=Codecs.com |date=2005-08-30 |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Virtualdub-MPEG2 |title=Virtualdub-MPEG2 |author=VideoHelp.com |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a fork is Nandub, which enabled use of [[Smart Bitrate Control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nickyguides.digital-digest.com/nandub.htm |title=Nandub / SBC Encoding |publisher=Nicky Pages' Digital Solutions |accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Running on Linux and Mac OS X systems==
VirtualDub runs under [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]] operating systems using [[Wine (software)|Wine]], including the popular Deshaker plugin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forums.opensuse.org/new-user-how-faq-read-only/unreviewed-how-faq/429428-howto-install-virtualdub-under-wine-deshaker-plugin.html|title=HowTo install VirtualDub under wine with deshaker plugin|author=oldcpu|accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, native support for these systems is not available.
