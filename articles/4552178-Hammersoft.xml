'''Interstate 95''' ('''I-95''') is the main [[highway]] on the [[East Coast of the United States]],&lt;ref&gt;David Montgomery and Josh White, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 128 Cars, Trucks Crash in Snow on I-95, February 23, 2001, p. A1&lt;/ref&gt; paralleling the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from [[Florida]] to [[Maine]]. The [[Massachusetts]] portion of the highway enters from the state of [[Rhode Island]] in [[Attleboro, Massachusetts|Attleboro]] and travels in a northeasterly direction to the junction with [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] in [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]]. As the original plans for I-95 (which would have taken it through downtown [[Boston]]) were canceled, the highway follows the Route 128 loop around the [[Greater Boston]] area to [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]]. From there, I-95 splits from Route 128 and turns north towards the [[Merrimack River]]. I-95 enters [[New Hampshire]] from [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]].

==Route description==
===Attleboro to Canton===
I-95 crosses the state border from [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]] into [[Attleboro, Massachusetts|Attleboro]] as a six-lane highway, with the first northbound exits, 2A and 2B, providing access to [[Route 1A (Massachusetts)|Route 1A]] and nearby [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] near the border. (There is an Exit 1, but it is a southbound-only exit connecting to US-1 south into Rhode Island.)  Exits 3-5 also serve the Attleboro area, with Exit 4 at the northern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Rhode Island â Massachusetts)|Interstate 295]].

Exits 6A and 6B in [[Mansfield, Massachusetts|Mansfield]] provide access to [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]], the &quot;outer circumferential&quot; beltway around metro Boston.  I-495 provides northbound connections to [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], and the western part of the state, and southbound connections to [[Cape Cod]].  Mansfield is home to the [[Comcast Center (amphitheatre)|Comcast Center]], a [[Live Nation]]-owned [[amphitheatre]] which hosts numerous concert events, and the [[TPC Boston]], a [[PGA Tour|PGA]] player's club that hosts the [[Deutsche Bank Championship]] yearly.  The two venues are located near I-95's interchanges with [[Route 140 (Massachusetts)|Route 140]].

I-95 continues northward into [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]], home of [[Gillette Stadium]], located on US-1 and accessible from Exit 9.  The interstate continues through [[Sharon, Massachusetts|Sharon]], [[Walpole, Massachusetts|Walpole]], and [[Norwood, Massachusetts|Norwood]], before entering [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], where it meets [[Interstate 93]] at its southern terminus (Exit 12).

===Canton to Peabody (Route 128)===
Upon interchanging with I-93, I-95 loops around to the west, taking over the roadbed from I-93 and joining US-1 southbound in a [[wrong-way concurrency]]. [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] begins here as well.  The highway enters [[Westwood, Massachusetts|Westwood]] next, with US-1 leaving the freeway near the [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]] town line (at Exit 15B) to parallel I-95 back to the south. I-95 and Route 128 begin to make their way around metro Boston, passing through Dedham, [[Needham, Massachusetts|Needham]], and [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]], where the freeway interchanges with [[Route 9 (Massachusetts)|Route 9]] at Exit 20, and the freeway widens to eight lanes. About three miles north, I-95/Route 128 enter [[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]] and interchange with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] (I-90, at Exit 25) in a large interchange which provides connections to nearby [[Massachusetts Route 30|Route 30]].  Exits 23, 24, and 25 are one combined exit northbound.

I-95 and Route 128 are due west of the city at this point and begin to turn to the northeast, serving the city of [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] and the town of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] along the way.  The freeway interchanges with [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] (Concord Turnpike) at Exit 29.  Upon entering the town of [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]], I-95 and Route 128 interchange with [[U.S. Route 3]], the Northwestern Expressway, at Exit 32A.  US-3 provides a direct freeway connection with the [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] and [[Nashua, NH]] metro areas.  Access to the Middlesex Turnpike and Burlington retail district is facilitated at this interchange as well.  US-3 south briefly joins the freeway in another wrong-way multiplex in order to connect with its old alignment, leaving at Exit 33A.  I-95 and Route 128 continue northeast through the city of [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] and into [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]].

In Reading, I-95 and Route 128 once again interchange with I-93. After crossing, I-93, the now six-lane highway continues to the northeast, serving the towns of [[Wakefield, Massachusetts|Wakefield]] and [[Lynnfield, Massachusetts|Lynnfield]] before crossing into [[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], where Route 128 leaves I-95 at Exit 45 as its own freeway towards [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]].  At this interchange, six lanes of through traffic are designated for Route 128 while four lanes split off as I-95.

===Peabody to Salisbury===
After leaving Route 128, I-95 expands to eight lanes and heads north through the less densely populated northeastern portion of the state.  The freeway serves the communities of [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]], [[Boxford, Massachusetts|Boxford]], [[Georgetown, Massachusetts|Georgetown]], [[Rowley, Massachusetts|Rowley]], [[Newbury, Massachusetts|Newbury]], [[West Newbury, Massachusetts|West Newbury]], [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]], [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]], and [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]].  Traffic density is generally low on this {{convert|25|mi}} stretch of freeway.  After Exit 57, the highway narrows to six lanes until the I-495 interchange expands it back to eight lanes.

I-495 has its northern terminus at I-95 Exit 59 just south of the [[New Hampshire]] state line, a Y-interchange that merges I-495 onto I-95.  Southbound access is possible via Exit 58 for [[Massachusetts Route 110|Route 110]] westbound, which leads to I-495's Exit 55 (I-495's last exit before I-95).  The northernmost exit in Massachusetts is Exit 60, providing access to Main Street towards Amesbury and Route 286 towards Salisbury Beach and [[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire|Hampton Beach]] (the southbound ramp starts in New Hampshire).  After crossing underneath the connecting roads, I-95 crosses the state line into [[Seabrook, New Hampshire]].

==History==
The original plans called for I-95 to run through downtown [[Boston]].  The highway would have progressed from Route 128 and [[Readville, Massachusetts|Readville]], followed the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]], joined the [[Inner Belt (Boston)|Inner Belt]] in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], heading east, and joining the [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]] at South Bay, then north to the [[Central Artery]] at the [[South Station]] interchange with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]/[[Interstate 90]], and connecting with the [[Northeast Expressway (Boston)|Northeast Expressway]] at the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] banks of the [[Charles River]].

However, due to pressure from local residents, all proposed Interstate Highways within [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] were canceled in 1972 by Governor [[Francis Sargent]] with the exception of [[Interstate 93]] to Boston. The only sections of I-95 completed within the Route 128 beltway by the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] were the segment known as the [[Northeast Expressway (Boston)|Northeast Expressway]] north from Charlestown to [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]], which is now part of [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. 1]], and the Central Artery, which cut the [[North End, Boston|North End]] neighborhood from downtown Boston proper.  The Southwest Expressway and the Inner Belt highways were among the Sargent-canceled highways.
[[Image:Boston, Massachusetts 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Original 1955 Yellow Book plan showing the southwestern routing of I-95 to the [[Interstate 695 (Massachusetts)|Inner Belt]].  The modern I-95 follows the outer belt shown on this map (now considered the &quot;inner&quot; [[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] compared to the &quot;outer&quot; [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] which is not shown).]]
Between 1972 and 1974, plans were to extend I-95 along a northerly extension of the Northeast Expressway to Route 128 in northwestern [[Danvers, Massachusetts|Danvers]]. During this time, I-95 was officially routed along Route 128 from [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]] to [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] and north along the [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]] (also designated [[Route 3 (Massachusetts)|Route 3]]), from Braintree to Boston, then following the Central Artery, and continuing along the Northeast Expressway in Boston, Chelsea and Revere.

When the Northeast Expressway extension (between Saugus and Danvers) was canceled in 1974, I-95's route shifted to its current routing along the perimeter highway, Route 128, and I-93 was extended to meet I-95 in Canton. Plans for the abandoned roadways can still be seen going from the end of the Northeast Expressway to the [[Saugus River]] in [[Saugus, Massachusetts|Saugus]].  Along the unbuilt alignment from Saugus to Route 128, one can see unused bridges, ghost ramps, and gradedâbut unpavedâroadbed that was originally intended to carry I-95.

==Future improvements==
Currently MassDOT is adding a fourth lane in each direction along the 128 section from the I-95 interchange in Canton to the Route 9 interchange in Newton, where the rush hour traffic has been for some time permitted to use the breakdown lanes on the highway shoulder. The section south of Route 109 is largely complete, while the section to the north is due to be completed by 2015. The state will begin a $285 million project in 2012 to replace the Whittier Bridge over the Merrimack River and widening the highway to eight Lanes (four in each direction) from the bridge to I-495.
