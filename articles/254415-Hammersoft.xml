{{Politics of Minnesota}}

The '''Minnesota Senate''' is the [[upper house]] in the [[Minnesota Legislature]].  There are 67 members, half as many as are in the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]]. In terms of membership, it is the largest [[upper house]] of any [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].  Each Senate district in the state includes an ''A'' and ''B'' House district (e.g. Senate district 41 contains House districts 41A and 41B). The [[Minnesota Constitution]] forbids a House district to be within more than one Senate district. Before the 1960s, Senators were apportioned by [[county (US)|county]], resulting in the underrepresentation of those in cities. From statehood through 1972 the [[Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota]] served as [[List of Presidents of the Minnesota Senate|President of the Senate]]. In 1972 the voters approved a constitutional amendment that provided for the senate to elect its own president from among its members effective January 1973. Functionally, the leadership in the Senate is vested in the [[Majority Leader]].

Members are elected to four year terms in years ending in 2 and 6, and for two year terms in years ending in 0.  Districts are redrawn after the census in time for the primary and general elections in years ending in 2. The state legislature is located in the [[Minnesota State Capitol]] building in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].

In the [[Minnesota Senate elections, 2010|2010 election]] the Republicans gained a majority for the first time since partisan identification returned to the legislature in 1974.
