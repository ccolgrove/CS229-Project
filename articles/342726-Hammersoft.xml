''Lakehead Technical Institute'' was established on June 4, 1946, by an Order-in-Council of the Province of [[Ontario]]. Classes commenced in January 1948, in temporary rented quarters in downtown [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]]. In September of that same year, the first university courses were added to the curriculum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harold S 1987&quot;&gt;Harold S. Braun with William G. Tamblyn. 'A Northern Vision: The Development of Lakehead University.' Thunder Bay: Lakehead University, President's Office, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology'' was established by an Act of the [[Ontario Legislature]] proclaimed on August 1, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Lakehead University Act board.lakeheadu.ca/wp/?pg=18&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, the original Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology Act was amended to grant the college authority to establish new faculties, and confer degrees in arts and sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harold S 1987&quot;/&gt; The Lakehead University Act, 1965, was given royal assent on June 22, 1965, and came into force on July 1, 1965. The ''Lakehead College of Arts, Science and Technology'', thereafter known as &quot;Lakehead University,&quot; was continued under this new charter. The first degrees were conferred on May 5, 1965. The first university chancellor was Senator [[Norman McLeod Paterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lakehead University - Fall Campus.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Thunder Bay Campus]]

The original college site comprised some 32 hectares of land in south-west [[Port Arthur, Ontario]]. From 1962 to 1965, an additional 87 hectares of adjoining land were purchased in anticipation of future expansion. The first building was opened in 1957.

In 2005 the [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]] (NOSM) was formed as a joint initiative between Lakehead University and [[Laurentian University]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]]. NOSM is organised within the Faculty of Medicine of both Laurentian (East Campus) and Lakehead (West Campus) universities. The medical school has multiple teaching and research sites across [[Northern Ontario]], including large and small communities. Students are given a choice of attending either one of the two main NOSM campuses.

Lakehead University is home to one of the top Ancient-DNA laboratories in the world. The Paleo-DNA Laboratory was the first university affiliated laboratory in Canada to become accredited by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) for forensic DNA testing. Lakehead University Paleo-DNA Laboratory has gained recognition for work done in its state-of-the-art facility on a wide array of subjects, such as the remains from Titanic victims, and most recently the DNA samples used in the documentary âThe Lost Tomb of Jesus.â

A new [[law school]] is being established and will accept its first students in 2013.  The new program will be housed in the former [[Port Arthur Collegiate Institute]].

Lakehead University's physical plant now consists of 39 buildings and 116 hectares of property including 40 hectares of landscaped and maintained grounds.

==Residence==
Lakehead University has the following residences: Avila; Bartley; Prettie; Residence Townhouse; Student Housing Apartment 1 and Student Housing Apartment 2.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rev.gov.on.ca/en/lists/itrp/6921.html Ontario University Residences list&lt;/ref&gt;  

Accommodations at Lakehead are divided into three living styles: residence halls, apartments and townhouses. The Thunder Bay residence currently has a total of 1,196 beds and three cafeteria/dining halls. Students can choose from meal options that range from kitchenette, full-kitchen and complete meal plan depending on the residence styles.

The men's residence for 52 students was opened in September 1962. By 1966, 32 additional double bedrooms were added to the residence and a section of the new structure was made available as a residence for women. A new residence village comprising 10 new buildings and providing residence for 520 students was completed in 1968. The village is situated on the banks of the McIntyre River within easy 5-minute walking distance of all university buildings and athletic facilities.

From 1989 to 1992, a complex of townhouses marked the newest addition to the residence facility that included units accessible to the physically challenged.

A 271-bed residence in Orillia is slated to open its doors in Fall 2011.
