The '''bikini''' is typically a women's two-piece [[swimsuit]]. One part of the attire covers the [[breast]]s and the other part covers the [[crotch]] and part of or the entire [[buttocks]], leaving an uncovered area between the two. ''[[MerriamâWebster]]'' describes the bikini as &quot;a woman's scanty two-piece bathing suit&quot; or &quot;a man's brief swimsuit&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam-webster.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bikini|publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]''|date=June 25, 2011|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bikini}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often worn in hot weather, while swimming or sunbathing. The shapes of both parts of a bikini resemble women's underwear, and the lower part can range from revealing [[thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[g-string]] to briefs. 

While two-piece bathing suits had been worn on the beach before, the modern bikini was invented by French engineer [[Louis RÃ©ard]] in 1946. He named it after [[Bikini Atoll]] in the Pacific, the site of the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear weapon tests in July that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swimsuit-style.com/bikini.html Swimsuit Trivia â The Surprising History of the Bikini].

The bikini is perhaps the most popular female beachwear around the globe, according to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard due to &quot;the power of women, and not the power of fashion&quot;. As he explains, &quot;The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women.&quot;&lt;ref name=BBCW&gt;Kathryn Westcott, &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/5130460.stm The Bikini: Not a brief affair]&quot;, BBC News, 2006-06-05&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 2000s, bikinis had become a $811 million business annually, according to the [[NPD Group]], a consumer and retail information company.&lt;ref name=SFC&gt;Sylvia Rubin, &quot;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/07/02/BIKINI.TMP&amp;type=printable Fashion shocker of '46: the naked belly button]&quot;, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 2006-07-02&lt;/ref&gt; The bikini has boosted spin-off services like [[bikini wax]]ing and the suntanning industries.&lt;ref name=AgeL&gt;Lorna Edwards, &quot;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/02/1148956539436.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 You've still got it, babe], ''[[The Age]]'', 2006-06-03&lt;/ref&gt;

A statue of Venus in a bikini was found in a cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found in the front hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/gallery/allison Pompeian Households], [http://www.stoa.org/gallery/albums.php Stoa Image Gallery], [http://www.stoa.org/ The Stoa Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; A statue of Venus was recovered from the ''[[tablinum]]'' of the [[House of Julia Felix]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beard &amp; John Henderson, ''Classical Art'', page 116, Oxford University Press, 2001, ISBN 0192842374&lt;/ref&gt; and another from an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] at the garden at [[House of Loreius Tiburtinus|Via Dell'Abbondanza]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth B.

The groundwork for the modern bikini began to be laid in 1907, when Australian swimmer and performer [[Annette Kellerman]] was arrested on a [[Boston]] beach for wearing a form-fitting one-piece swimsuit, which became an accepted beach attire for women by 1910. In 1913, inspired by the introduction of women into Olympic swimming, designer [[Carl Jantzen]] made the first functional two-piece [[swimwear]], a close-fitting one-piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=American Heritage Inc.|title=60 Years of Bikinis|author=Hoover, Elizabeth D.|date=2006-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, necklines plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared and sides were cut away. Hollywood endorsed the new glamour with films such as ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' in which [[Esther Williams]] wore provocatively named costumes such as &quot;Double Entendre&quot; and &quot;Honey Child&quot;.&lt;ref name=notting&gt;David Sandhu, &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/728059/Nottingham-Bathed-in-nostalgia.html Nottingham: Bathed in nostalgia]&quot;, ''The Telegraph'' (UK), 2003-08-04&lt;/ref&gt; With new materials like [[latex]] and [[nylon]], by 1934 the swimsuit started hugging the body and had shoulder straps to lower for tanning.&lt;ref name=carnival&gt;[http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil History of the Bikini], Carnival&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MichelineBernardini.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Micheline Bernardini]] modeling the first modern bikinis]]

By the early 1940s two-piece swimsuits were frequent on American beaches. [[Hollywood]] stars such as [[Ava Gardner]], [[Rita Hayworth]] and [[Lana Turner]] tried similar swimwear or beachwear.&lt;ref name=3X24&gt;James Kitchling, [http://www.3x24.com/short-history-of-bikinis-and-swimsuits/801764 Short History of Bikinis and Swimsuits], 3X24 News Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pin up]]s of Hayworth and [[Esther Williams]] in the costume were widely distributed.&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

Finally, the modern bikini was introduced by French engineer [[Louis RÃ©ard]] and fashion designer [[Jacques Heim]] in Paris in 1946.  RÃ©ard was a car engineer but by 1946 he was running his mother's lingerie boutique near [[Folies BergÃ¨re|Les Folies BergÃ¨res]] in Paris.&lt;ref name=TimA&gt;Adam Sage, &quot;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article705414.ece Happy birthday: the 'shocking and immoral' bikini hits 60]&quot;, ''[[The Times]]'', 2006-04-16&lt;/ref&gt; Heim was working on a new kind of beach costume. It comprised two pieces, the bottom large enough to cover its wearer's navel. In May 1946, he advertised the bathing suit, known as the &quot;Atome,&quot; as the world's &quot;smallest bathing suit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Thomas G., II, [http://www.genders.org/g53/g53_cole.html &quot;(The) Bikini: EmBodying the Bomb&quot;] ''Genders Journal''. para. 8&lt;/ref&gt; RÃ©ard named his swimsuit the &quot;bikini&quot;, taking the name from the [[Bikini Atoll]], one of a series of islands in the South Pacific where testing on the new atomic bomb was occurring that summer.  Historians assume Reard termed his swimsuit the &quot;bikini&quot; because he believed its revealing style would create reactions among people similar to those created by Americaâs atomic bomb in Japan just one summer earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhistory.com/1-50/002bikini.html Tiny Swimsuit That Rocked the World: A History of the Bikini].

==Bikini variants==
{{main|Bikini variant}}
[[File:Woman in black thong bikini with tattoo and wearing bracelets and wrist cuff.jpg|thumb|left|187px|String bikini]]

The bikini has spawned many stylistic variations. A regular bikini is defined as a two pieces of garments that cover the groin and buttocks at the lower end and the breasts in the upper end. Some bikinis can offer a large amount of coverage, while other bikinis provide only the barest minimum. Topless variants may still be considered bikinis, although technically no longer two-piece swimsuits.&lt;ref name=SStyle&gt;[http://www.swimsuit-style.com/bikini-swimsuit.html Bikini], Swimsuit Styles&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a variation in designs, the term ''bikini'' was followed by an often hilarious lexicon including the monokini (top part missing), seekini (transparent bikini), tankini ([[tank top]], bikini bottom), camikini ([[camisole]] top and bikini bottom) and hikini.&lt;ref&gt;Barry J.

[[File:Red polka tankini.jpg|thumb|167px|Tankini]]

Bikini tops come in different styles and cuts, including a halter-style neck that offers more coverage and support, a strapless [[bandeau]], a rectangular strip of fabric covering the breasts that minimizes large breasts, a top with cups similar to a [[Brassiere designs#&quot;Push-up&quot; bras|push-up bra]], and the more traditional triangle cups that lift and shape the breasts. Bikini bottoms vary in style and cut and in the amount of coverage they offer, coverage ranging anywhere from complete underwear-style coverage, as in the case of more modest bottom pieces like briefs, shorts, or briefs with a small skirt-panel attached, to almost full exposure, as in the case of the thong bikini. Skimpier styles have narrow sides, including V-cut (in front), French cut (with high-cut sides) and low-cut string (with string sides).&lt;ref name=SStyle/&gt; In just one major fashion show in 1985 were two-piece suits with [[Crop top|cropped tank tops]] instead of the usual skimpy bandeaux, suits that are bikinis in front and one-piece in back, [[Suspenders|suspender straps]], [[ruffle]]s, and daring, navel-baring cutouts.&lt;ref&gt;Fashion Correspondent, &quot;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB29A230AE055D5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Swimsuits take some inspiration from the past]&quot;, ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 1985-11-10&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent variations on the theme include the monokini, tankini, string bikini, thong, slingshot, minimini, teardrop, and micro.&lt;ref&gt;David Diefendorf &amp; James Randi, ''Amazing...

===Bikini underwear===
Types of underwear worn by both men and women are identified as '''bikini underwear''', similar in size and revealing nature to the bottom half of a bikini bathing suit. For women, bikini underwear can refer to virtually any tight, skimpy, or revealing undergarment that provides less coverage to the midsection than traditional underwear, [[panties]] or knickers. For men, a bikini is a type of undergarment that is smaller and more revealing than men's briefs.

==Men's bikini==
The term '''men's bikini''' is used to describe types of [[Swim briefs|men's swimsuits]], men's underwear, or similar garments. Men's bikinis can have both high or low side panels, string sides or tie sides, and most lack a button or flap front. Many do not have a visible waistband like briefs. Suits less than 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, [[fashion]], and [[sun tanning]]. An example of this style, known as the posing brief, is the standard for competitions in the sport of [[bodybuilding]]. Male [[punk rock]] musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs.&lt;ref&gt;A. W.
