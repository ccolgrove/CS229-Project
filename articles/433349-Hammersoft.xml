== Early life ==
Jason David Frank was born in [[Covina, California]], a city in the county of Los Angeles.  He attended [[Bonita High School]]. Frank first became interested in Martial Arts when he was young, and at the age of 4 he trained at The Red Dragon Karate School. When he was 12 he started teaching other children, and when he turned 18, he and a friend decided to buy the school. He then wanted to do martial arts in film so he pursued acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Former TV Power Ranger Star to Make UWC Debut |work=[[Sherdog]]  |date=2010-06-19|url= http://www.sherdog.com/news/press%20releases/Former-TV-Power-Ranger-Star-to-Make-UWC-Debut-24407
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Frank auditioned for ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' in 1993 when he was 19. He was cast in the role of Tommy Oliver, the Green Ranger. He later became the White Ranger.

Frank was supposed to be the lead character Adam Steele in ''[[VR Troopers]]'' (originally called &quot;Cybertron&quot;) and shot a pilot episode before being called back to ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers|Power Rangers]]''. According to both Frank and [[Brad Hawkins]], Hawkins was to replace Frank originally as the White Ranger on Power Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grnrngr.com/documents/prnl62.txt |title=THE POWER RANGERS ZEO NEWSLETTER - THE NEWSLETTER OF THE POWER RANGER CLUB - ISSUE #62 -- MAY 8, 1996 - &quot;MAN, THEY'RE NEVER GONNA BELIEVE THIS ON THE INTERNET!&quot; |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://henshinjustice.com/2007/09/03/cybertron-the-original-pilot-for-vr-troopers-starring-jason-david-frank/ CYBERTRON: The Original Pilot for VR Troopers, Starring Jason David Frank!!!]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to Frank's popularity with ''Ranger'' fans, he was brought back as the White Ranger again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQSdJXRUEI |title=&quot;Power Rangers Q &amp; A at AFO X&quot;, 7.51 in |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkins would take over on ''VR Troopers''.

After three seasons ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' became ''[[Power Rangers: Zeo]]''. The transition is part of the annual Ranger suit change to match the annual change of the ''[[Super Sentai]]'' series. Frank's character became the Red Zeo Ranger. The following year in ''[[Power Rangers: Turbo]]'' he became the first Red Turbo Ranger. During mid-season Frank and fellow cast members [[Johnny Yong Bosch]], [[Nakia Burrise]] and [[Catherine Sutherland]] agreed to leave and were replaced.

After he left the series in 1997, Frank came back to ''Power Rangers'' as Zeo Ranger V in 2002 for the special 10th anniversary episode, entitled &quot;[[Forever Red]]&quot;, in ''[[Power Rangers: Wild Force]]'' (reuniting with [[Austin St. John]]). He then reprised his role in 2004 in ''[[Power Rangers: Dino Thunder]]'', as the Black Dino Ranger. This was a favor to [[Douglas Sloan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFQSdJXRUEI |title=Q&amp;A At Afo X |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He's joked that Saban and Disney are &quot;both the same, they're cheap&quot; but that he was impressed with the production crew for Dino Thunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjIUfjmBrDs |title=Q&amp;A at AKO X Part 5, 4.02 in |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took a lot of time off from the season to return to Los Angeles, as he still had to manage Rising Sun Karate.

Frank appeared in the most ''Power Rangers'' episodes: 258 character appearances and 243 actual appearances. He also appeared in the most seasons: seven total (''Mighty Morphin'' [3 seasons], ''Zeo'', ''Turbo'', ''Wild Force'', and ''Dino Thunder''. Frank has also worn the most different colors of Power Rangers suits (green, white, red[twice], and black).

=== Fighting and martial arts ===
With his knowledge of many different styles of [[martial arts]], Frank collected the most practical applications, modified them with his own philosophies and created his own blend of American Karate, Toso Kune Do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Former 'Power Rangers' Star Set To Get In The Ring With UFC |work=[[Yahoo]]  |date=2010-06-22|url= http://omg.yahoo.com/news/former-power-rangers-star-set-to-get-in-the-ring-with-ufc/27270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suckerpunchent.com/featured-story/suckerpunch-officially-morphd-mma/ |title=Not a Martial Ats Magazine: SP HAS OFFICIALLY MORPHâD MMA :: SuckerPunch Entertainment |publisher=Suckerpunchent.com |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=June 2010}} On June 28, 2003, he was inducted into the [[World Karate Union]] Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.needmywebsite.com/wku/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=4 |title=BLOG: 2003 WKU HALL OF FAME JUNE 28, 2003 - Chateau at Camelback Tannersville, Pa |publisher=Needmywebsite.com |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=June 2010}} Frank appeared at the [[Arnold Classic]] on February 29, 2008, in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

== Mixed martial arts ==
Frank also has an interest in [[mixed martial arts]]. He was scheduled to fight against Ron 'The Badger' McMasters on June 23, 2007, at the Williamson County Pavilion in [[Marion, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080630190855/http://media.www.siude.com/media/storage/paper1096/news/2007/06/19/OtherSports/Power.Ranger.To.Fight.In.Cage-2916017.shtml Power Ranger to fight in cage - Daily Egyptian, Other Sports]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frank opted out of the fight since he did not appreciate the event getting changed from an MMA fight to an exhibition boxing match because his opponent was trained only in boxing, and because he felt that an exhibition match where both fighters are declared winners was &quot;meaningless&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080315030404/http://media.www.siude.com/media/storage/paper1096/news/2007/06/21/Sports/Power.Ranger.A.No.Show-2917818.shtml?reffeature=recentlycommentedstoriestab Power Ranger a no show - Daily Egyptian, Sports]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank was scheduled to make his debut with Ultimate Warrior Challenge at their upcoming event on May 22 against James âRayâ Handy Jr. in a light heavyweight bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwcmma.com/events/ |title=UWC 8 - Judgement Day - May 22, 2010 - GMU Patriot Center - Fairfax, VA |publisher=Uwcmma.com |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21 Frank announced on his official Facebook fan page that James Handy was injured and Carlos Horn will replace him, changing the fight to a heavyweight bout.

Since turning pro, Frank has expressed interest in signing a deal with [[Strikeforce]] and potentially fighting [[Herschel Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Jason David Frank turns pro, wants in Strikeforce| publisher=mmaweekly | url=http://mmaweekly.com/jason-frank-turns-pro-wants-in-strikeforce-2| date=| accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank announced on his Facebook fan page that he would be scheduled to make his professional debut on August 4, 2010 in Houston at &quot;Puro Combate #1.&quot; He fought at heavyweight, with his opponent being Jose Roberto Vasquez. Frank won his pro MMA debut quickly at the time of 0:46 in the first round by a Rear Naked Choke Submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/jasondfrank?v=wall&amp;story_fbid=137593976254898 |title=JASON DAVID FRANK - Official Fan Page |publisher=Facebook.com |date=2010-06-18 |accessdate=2010-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.txmma.com/2010/07/06/texas-cage-fighting-presents-puro-combate-1-aug-4th-2/&lt;/ref&gt;
Frank was scheduled for a Light Heavyweight bout on December 9, 2010 at Puro Combate 3. The fight was canceled on December 8 due to his opponent not being medically cleared.
