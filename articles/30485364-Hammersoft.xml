The '''Italian regional elections of 1975''' were held on [[June 15]]. The fifteen ordinary regions, created in 1970, elected their '''second''' assemblies. Following the 1971 census, [[Piedmont]], [[Veneto]] and [[Latium]] had ten more seats each.

==Electoral system==
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] had traditionally become the electoral system of [[Italy]], and it was adopted for the regional vote too. Each [[Italian province]] corresponded to a constituency electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Droop quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at regional level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

==Results==
Summary of the results of all the lists reaching at least a tenth of the suffrages.

Nine Regional Councils elected ad administration led by a [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]]'s member with a [[centrism|centrist]] alliance, while three regions, [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria|Ligury]] and [[Latium]], changed side adding themselves to the traditional [[leftist]] strongholds [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Umbria]]: PCI and PSI shared three presidencies each. It was a big victory for Communist leader [[Enrico Berlinguer]].

The results were a shock for the DC which, even if remaining the majority party, saw the possibility of an historical defeat at national level in the next election. The secretary [[Amintore Fanfani]] was fired, and the government led by [[Aldo Moro]] began to find more and more difficulties, leading to an early end of the national legislature the following year.
