'''Sialkot''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|Ø³ÛØ§ÙÚ©ÙÙ¹}}}}) is a city in Pakistan situated in the north-east of the [[Punjab (Pakistani province)|Punjab]] province at the foothills of snow-covered peaks of [[Kashmir]] near the [[Chenab]] river. It is the capital of [[Sialkot District]]. The [[city]] is about {{Convert|125|km|abbr=on}} north-west of [[Lahore]] and only a few kilometers from Indian-controlled [[Jammu]].
The recorded history of [[Sialkot District|Sialkot]] covers thousands of years. Sialkot has, since its foundation, changed hands from [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[Iran|Persian]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Afghanistan|Afghan]], [[Turkic peoples|Turk]], [[Sikh]], [[Muslims]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] rule to that of present-day [[Pakistan]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Sialkot}}
There are various sources tracing the origins of the city of Sialkot but the authenticity of many of these sources varies. Excavations throughout the area have revealed large amounts of [[Ancient Greek coinage|Greek coins]], ancient [[Zoroastrian]] temples and several [[Buddhist]] stupas. The antiquities of Sialkot have also been discussed by Sir [[Alexander Cunningham]] in his Archaeological Survey Reports, II, 21, 22, and XIV, 44 to 47.

According to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historical texts, which bring mention of the city of Sialkot dating back to before 327 BC when the city was known as [[Sagala]], it represented the eastern-most outpost and expansion of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic Empire]] created by [[Alexander the Great]] which has been cross-correlated to ancient Greek maps of the era and several monuments found in the [[Sialkot District]]. The Greek historians state that the city was one of the most productive [[Silk]] regions of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] had earned a reputation of being one of the richest [[satrapy]] (province), beside Gandhara, of the then Persian Empire. SÃ¡kala or [[Sagala]] was the capital, or one of the capitals, of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] which broke-away from the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] during the [[Euthydemus I|Euthydemid Dynasty]], and the residence of [[Menander I]] (Milinda) during his reign between 160 and 135 BC. Shun and Dall were two of the most powerful tribes in Sialkot.

Popular legends attribute the foundation of Sialkot city to Raja Sala - the uncle of the Pandavas. According to Punjabi folk-lore, the early history of Sialkot is closely interwoven with the traditions of Raja (King) SÃ¡livÃ¡han, his son, Raja RasÃ¡lu, and his foe, Raja HÃºdi. A popular belief is that the city was re-founded by Raja SÃ¡livÃ¡han or [[SÃ¡lbÃ¡n]], in the time of Vikramaditya, when it became a part of [[Kashmir]] under Raja Sama Dutt. Raja SÃ¡livÃ¡han built a fort ([[Sialkot Fort]]) and the city and gave the place its present name.it is believed that the word &quot;Sialkot&quot; means the 'Fort of the Sia'. Legend also says that Raja SÃ¡livÃ¡han had two sons: Puran and Rasalu. Puran got punished by his father, Raja SÃ¡livÃ¡han, due to the  actions of his wicked stepmother and thrown into a well, still the resort of pilgrims near Sialkot, called &quot;Puran di Khui&quot;, (Puran's Well). A mohalla (town) in the city is also named &quot;Puran Nagar&quot;. The other son of Raja SÃ¡livÃ¡han, Rasalu, became Raja after the death of Raja SÃ¡livÃ¡han. Attacks from the neighbouring Raja of [[Jhelum]] ruined the city. Raja Rasalu got involved in wars with Raja Hudi, popularly stated to have been a [[Gakkhar]] chieftain. Being worsted in battle, Rasalu, as the price for peace, was forced to give his daughter in marriage to his conqueror, who gave the territory he had conquered to Rasalu's adopted son. After Rasalu's death in 400 AD, there are no significant accounts of Sialkot for the next 300 years in the known history except that, after the invasion of the [[Indo-Hephthalites|HÃºnas]] ([[Huns]] or [[Hephthalites]]) in the last quarter of the 5th century AD, it became the capital of [[ToramÃ¡na]] and his son [[Mihirakula]] until he was defeated by a native Indian Prince, [[Yasodharman]].

Sialkot became a part of the [[Muslim]] [[Sultanate of Delhi]] when the Afghan noble [[Muhammad of Ghor|Sultan Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Ghauri]] conquered [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 1185. He was unable to conquer [[Lahore]] but left a garrison in Sialkot. Later, Sultan Khusro Malik tried to capture the city but failed to do so. Sialkot then became a part of the [[Muslim]] [[Mughal Empire]] which was of Central Asian origin. The Mughal commander, Usman Ghani Raza, advanced towards Delhi by way of Sialkot which capitulated to his armies.

In 'Babur Nama', [[Babur|Zaheer-ud-Din Muhammad Babur]] records: {{Cquote|29th December: We dismounted at Sialkot. If one goes into Hindustan, the [[Jat]]s and [[Gujjar|Gujar]]s always pour down in countless hordes from hill and plain for loot in bullock and buffalo. These ill-omened peoples are sensless oppressors! Previously, their deeds did not concern us because the territory was an enemy's. But they did the same sensless deeds after we had captured it. When we reached Sialkot, they swooped on the poor and needy folk who were coming out of the town to our camp, and stripped them bare. I had the witless brigands apprehended, and ordered a few of them to be cut to pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Babur Nama Page 250 published by Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the era of the Mughal Emperor, [[Akbar|Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar]], the present district of Sialkot formed a part of the Rachna-Bar Sarkar of the Lahore province. Under the reign of the Mughal Emperor, [[Shah Jahan|Shahab-ud-Din Muhammad Shah Jahan]], Ali Mardan Khan held the charge of Sialkot.

At the end of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dynasty, the suburbs and the outlying districts and areas of Sialkot were left to themselves. Sialkot, itself, was appropriated by a powerful family of [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] from [[Multan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], the [[Kakazai]], and another family from [[Quetta]]. In 1748, the four districts of [[Gujrat]], Sialkot, [[Pasrur]] and [[Daska]] were given to the Afghan Pashtun ruler, [[Ahmed Shah Durrani]], and the area was amalgamated into the Afghan empire. After 1751, Ahmed Shah Durrani left his son, Taimur, to rule Lahore and these districts. During that time, Raja Ranjit Deo of [[Jammu]] expanded his domination over the peripheral areas, but the city of Sialkot was not included in it. Afterwards, the city was held strongly by a Pashtun clan till the occupation of the [[Sikh]]s who ruled for a period of about 40 years followed by the British. The Pashtun presence is still considerable to this day and continues to attract newer Pashtun migrants and workers from Pakistan's tribal areas.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:MurrayCollegeChurch.jpg|200px|right|thumb| an old colonial church in [[Murray College]] Sialkot]] --&gt;
During the decline of the Durrani regime, Sialkot was occupied from the Pashtuns by the [[Sikh]]s and, thus, began the rise of their short-lived empire. Between 1797 to 1810, Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] occupied Sialkot. After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the British officers were appointed in Sialkot. Sialkot was annexed by the [[British Raj|British]] after the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849.

The British laid the foundation of the Sialkot cantonment in 1849 which was completed in 1852. For establishing the Sialkot cantonment, the British Commander-in-Chief, [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Sir Lord Napier]], surveyed and selected the area between the seasonal streams, Bher Nala and Palkhu Nala, from the point of view of defence. The Area Command laid its foundation in 1852 under the leadership of Major-General Angulas. During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] it was the scene of heavy fighting, and the [[Sialkot Fort]] was used by the Europeans for protection. The native troops plundered the [[treasury]] and destroyed all the records.

[[Murray College]], Sialkot was established in 1889. The railway branch from [[Wazirabad]] to Sialkot was extended to [[Jammu]] in 1890. The Sialkot-Narowal railway line was opened in 1915.

The city played an important role during the [[Pakistan Movement]]. The national poet of Pakistan, who spearheaded the movement for an independent country, [[Allama Iqbal|Dr. Muhammad Iqbal]] was born in Sialkot in 1877. In May 1944, the historic ''Sialkot Convention'' was held here. This convention is widely regarded as the landmark event which catapulted the [[All India Muslim League]] into prominence in the British-Indian [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]]. This convention was host to such [[All India Muslim League|Muslim League]] luminaries as [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], [[Chaudhry Naseer Ahmad Malhi]], [[Khawaja Nazimuddin|Khawaja Nazim-ud-Din]], [[Abdur Rab Nishtar|Sardar Abd-ur-Rab Nishtar]], Mumtaz Ahmad Khan Daultana, Nawab Iftikhar Hussain Khan Mamdot and Maulvi Tamiz-ud-Din.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ChawindaBattel.jpg|200px|right|thumb| [[Battle of Chawinda]] was the biggest tank battle since the [[Battle of Kursk]] in [[World War II]]]] --&gt;

After the independence of [[Pakistan]] from the British Empire in 1947, the Muslim residents of [[Pathankot]], [[Gurdaspur district|Gurdaspur]] and other parts of [[East Punjab]] came to Sialkot as refugees and settled here. Most of the refugees have since settled and inter-married into the local population. Ever since, Sialkot has become one of the major industrial centres of Pakistan and is well-known for its manufacture and export of surgical instruments, musical instruments, sports goods, leather goods, textile products and other light manufactures.

During the [[Second Kashmir War]] in 1965, the Lahore-Sialkot region (along with the Karachi region) was attacked by the [[Indian Army]] which, despite overwhelming numerical superiority managed only to capture some outlying areas in the sector. The people of Sialkot came out in full force to support the troops of the Pakistan Army to repel the invasion by India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Book&quot;&gt;K Conboy, &quot;Elite Forces of India and Pakistan&quot; ISBN 1-85532-209-9, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the armoured battles in the Sialkot sector (especially, the [[Battle of Chawinda]]), in 1965, were the most intense since the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://web.archive.org/web/20060503042035/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Books/Synopsis.html The India-Pakistan Air War of 1965]'', Synopsis. Retrieved 2008-05-26 at the [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, the Government of Pakistan awarded the ''[[Hilal-i-Istaqlal]]'' to the citizens of Sialkot, Lahore and Sargodha for their courage and bravery during the 1965 war between Pakistan and India.

Again, during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], the region witnessed bitter battles, most importantly, the [[Battle of Basantar]] in the Sialkot-ShakarGarh area. The major Indian [[Counteroffensive|counter-offensive]] came in this area where two large Pakistani tank regiments, equipped with the Patton tanks, lost part of the region despite outnumbering the Indian First Armoured Corps, which was equipped with British Centurion tanks.also have a small village chak sukha located on line of control on sialkot zafarwal road 20 km toward east.
