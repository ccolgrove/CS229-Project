'''[[Cannibalism]]''' is a recurring theme '''in popular culture''', especially within the [[horror genre]].

==In literature, film and television==
===As a cultural norm===
In many popular culture works that depict cannibalism, the act has been the cultural norm for a tribe or group of people, normally located in [[South America]]. Usually, the cannibalism has been used as an expression of a tribe's primitive savagery. 

An early literary example is provided by [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Typee]]'', a semi-factual account of Melville's voyage to the Pacific Island of [[Nuku Hiva]], where he spent several weeks living among the island's cannibal inhabitants before fleeing for of fear of being eaten.

The theme of cannibal tribes has been exploited by many [[horror film]]s, known as [[cannibal films]]. A common premise of these films concerns the discovery of such tribes by documentary filmmakers or [[anthropologists]]. These films were especially popular through the work of Italian filmmakers in the 1970s and 1980s. The first major film of this type was [[Umberto Lenzi]]'s 1972 film ''[[Il Paese del Sesso Selvaggio]]'' (''The Man from the Deep River''). This inspired other filmmakers to create cannibal films, with the genre reaching its peak in [[cannibal boom]] of 1977 to 1981. The most prolific of these films was [[Ruggero Deodato]]'s controversial ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' (1980), which influenced later cannibal movies, some of which adopted the moniker ''Cannibal Holocaust II'' in homage to Deodato's original. Other significant films from the 'cannibal boom' years include ''[[Ultimo mondo cannibale]]'' (1977) and ''[[Cannibal Ferox]]'' (1981).

Other later horror films have also included cannibal tribes or groups. A notable example is [[The Hills Have Eyes (series)|''The Hills Have Eyes'' series]] of films, which features a [[Jupiters Clan|clan]] of cannibalistic savages. ''[[Wrong Turn]]'' and [[Wrong Turn 2|its sequel]] features a cannibalistic group of [[mountain man|mountain men]].

The 1971 film ''Como Era Gostoso o Meu FrancÃªs'' (''[[How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman]]'') by [[Nelson Pereira dos Santos]], set in the 16th century, details the alleged cannibalistic practices of the indigenous [[Tupi people|Tupi]]namba warrior tribe against [[French people|French]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonizers.

A different example of cannibal culture in literature is found in the science fiction novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' (1961) by [[Robert A. Heinlein]], where some human culture is transformed as a result of the [[Martian]]s practice of eating one's dead friends as an act of great respect. This novel provided the inspiration for [[The Police]] song &quot;Friends&quot;, which appeared as a B-side on the UK single &quot;[[Don't Stand So Close to Me]]&quot; and the US single of &quot;[[De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da]]&quot;.

Some stories with talking animals or other sentient species consider it equivalent to cannibalism to eat another sentient creature, even one of a different species. An example is [[C. S. Lewis]]'s [[The Silver Chair]], in which the protagonists are horrified to discover that a certain group of giants condones the consumption of humans and talking animals.

In the [[Anne Rice]] novel, ''[[The Queen of the Damned]]'', many references are made to an ancient culture who practiced necro-cannibalism from the belief that the eating of their loved ones' remains was a more fitting funeral rite than either burying or burning them.

===As a means of survival===
[[Image:Accidente 1972.jpg|right|thumb|The wreckage of the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]]
Historically, cannibalism was sometimes practised as a last resort by people suffering from famine, and this theme has been used in popular culture. Indeed, occasionally, true stories of such acts of cannibalism have been portrayed. One example is of the 
1972 story of the survivors of [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]], who resorted to cannibalism in order to survive. The story of the survivors was chronicled in [[Piers Paul Read]]'s 1974 book, ''[[Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors]]'', in a 1993 film adaptation of the book, called simply [[Alive (1993 film)|''Alive'']], and in a 2008 documentary:  [[Stranded: I Have Come from a Plane That Crashed in the Mountains|''Stranded: Iâve Come From a Plane That Crashed on the Mountains'']]. 

Two other similar stories that have provided inspiration for popular culture adaptations are the accounts of [[Alferd Packer]] and the [[Donner Party]], both involving people eating human flesh in order to survive snowbound entrapment in the mountains. The 1999 film ''[[Ravenous]]'' combines elements of both stories. The tale of Packer is retold, with artistic liberty, in the 1980 film ''[[The Legend of Alfred Packer]]'' and in [[Trey Parker]]'s black comedy ''[[Cannibal! The Musical]]''.

A slightly different example is that of ''[[Survivor Type]]'', a short story by [[Stephen King]], which follows a shipwrecked victim stranded on a remote island, who is driven to eating his own body parts in order to survive. This story can also be seen in the manga [[One Piece]] where ship's cook Zeff and protagonist Sanji are stranded on a barren cliff in the middle of the sea. Zeff cuts off one leg and eats it while Sanji keeps the food that they managed to salvage from the shipwreck they were sailing on before.

[[Post-apocalyptic]] narratives have also featured cannibalism as a means of survival. The 1991 French film ''[[Delicatessen (film)|Delicatessen]]'' is set in an apartment block led by a butcher who deals with the food crisis by luring new tenants to the apartment, killing them, and serving them as meat to the other residents. In the 2006 post-apocalyptic [[zombie]] horror novel ''[[World War Z]]'' by [[Max Brooks]], many Americans head north into [[Canada]] to escape the [[undead]], the under-prepared survivors are forced into cannibalizing the dead in order to survive the harsh winters. In [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s novel ''[[The Road]]'', some of the survivors in the post-apocalyptic United States practice cannibalism as nearly all other sources of food (animals, plant life), have been destroyed.

===Unaware cannibals===
Sometimes, those eating the flesh of other humans in popular culture depictions are unaware of their cannibalistic acts, having been served it as a meal by a murderous cannibal host.

One of the oldest examples is [[Tantalus]] from [[Greek mythology]], who served the Olympian gods the flesh of his son, [[Pelops]]. None of the gods were fooled except [[Demeter]], who ate part of his shoulder. Pelops was resurrected, and his shoulder replaced with ivory. As for Tantalus, he was famously punished by being placed in a pool of water under a fruit tree. Whenever he tried to eat the fruit or drink the water, they moved away.

Another early example appears in [[William Shakespeare]]'s late sixteenth century play ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', where the character Tamora is unknowingly served a pie made from the remains of her two sons. Another literary occurrence is in [[Fannie Flagg]]'s novel ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe]]'', in which investigators are unknowingly fed the [[barbecue]]d ribs of a man whose murder they are investigating.

Lu Xun's Diary of a Madman, is premised on the notion that those who are eating flesh don't know it.  Hence the Madman is mad only insofar as those who participate in cannibalism are unaware of it.

In cinema, the most notable example is in the 1973 science fiction film ''[[Soylent Green]]''. In the movie, the Soylent Corporation produces rations of small green wafers in response to the food crisis. These wafers are advertised as being produced from &quot;high-energy plankton&quot;, but are actually the processed remains of human corpses. This film was parodied in the third segment of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror V]]&quot; (&quot;[[Nightmare Cafeteria]]&quot;), in which the teachers at [[Springfield Elementary School]] begin to eat children in response to overcrowding in detention, and serve the students' remains in the cafeteria.

This theme has also been used in parodies and [[black comedies]], for its humorous value of [[dramatic irony]]. In the 1987 film ''[[Eat the Rich (film)|Eat the Rich]]'', a disgruntled waiter and his friends kill the management and arrogant clientele of a restaurant and feed the bodies to unsuspecting customers. The 1975 musical parody ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' also features this form of cannibalism, as Dr. Frank N. Furter kills the character Eddie and serves his flesh to his dinner guests.

In a the Series 7 Episode of the popular British sitcom ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', &quot;[[Tikka to Ride]]&quot;, [[Dave Lister]] and [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|The Cat]] unknowingly (at first) eat the corpse of a dead man, which was cooked for them by the robot [[Kryten]]. His excuse was that &quot;if humans eat chickens, obviously they would eat their own species, otherwise they would just be picking on the chickens&quot;.

The people in ''[[Sweeney Todd (disambiguation)|Sweeney Todd]]'' eat meat pies made of humans killed by [[Sweeney Todd|Benjamin Barker]] (Sweeney Todd) with the aid of [[Mrs. Lovett]].

In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s [[The Silver Chair]], the protagonists (two children and a Marsh-wiggle) stay in a castle of Narnian giants, who serve them [[venison]]. It is revealed that the venison came from a talking stag, which in Narnia is tantamount to cannibalism. Later, the heroes find a cookbook with recipes for Man and Marsh-wiggle, similar to the plot of [[To Serve Man]].

In the 2001 episode of the [[Animation|animated]] [[Situational comedy|sitcom]] ''[[South Park]]'', entitled &quot;[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]&quot;, a main character named [[Eric Cartman]] feeds a high schooler's (Scott Tenorman) parents to him after getting them killed by a man who kills trespassers as revenge for Tenorman making Cartman buy his pubes for $16.00. Cartman had ground Tenorman's parents into chili, and had him eat it, which he initially enjoyed.

===As an accompaniment to killing===
Sometimes films are influenced by the morbid fascination surrounding real-life cases of cannibal murderers. 

The [[Armin Meiwes]] cannibalism case in Germany provided the inspiration for many feature films. The 2007 film ''[[Rohtenburg]]'' recounts a story of an American [[criminal psychology]] student in Germany, who decides to study cannibal killer Oliver Hartwin for her thesis. Hartwin, who fulfills his dream of eating a willing victim found on the Internet, is modelled on Meiwes, causing the film to initially be banned in Germany when Meiwes complained that his personal rights were being violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/04/movies/MoviesFeatures/04cann.html?_r=1|title=Cannibal wins ban of film in Germany |last=Landler|first=Mark|date=2006-03-04|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 film ''[[Cannibal (film)|Cannibal]]'', which reconstructed the event, was also banned in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0910548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other films based on the case include [[Rosa von Praunheim]]'s ''Dein Herz in Meinem Hirn'' (''Your Heart in My Brain'') and [[Ulli Lommel]]'s ''Diary of a Cannibal'' (2006). Brett Leonard's 2005 movie &quot;Feed&quot; references the Meiwes case in its opening scene.

Another murderer who influenced the creation of a fictional cannibal antagonist is [[Ed Gein]], who served as the inspiration for the characters of [[Norman Bates]] in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)]]'', Ezra Cobb in ''[[Deranged]]'' and [[Leatherface]] in ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and its sequels. Although Gein was not actually a cannibal himself, he did make various items out of the remains of humans. Leatherface wears a mask fashioned from human flesh and lives with a family of cannibals.

Another notable cannibalistic serial killer is [[Hannibal Lecter]], a fictional character created by author [[Thomas Harris]]. Lecter appears in the novels ''[[Red Dragon (novel)|Red Dragon]]'' (1981), ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1988), ''[[Hannibal (novel)|Hannibal]]'' (1999) and ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' (2006). When ''Red Dragon'' was first adapted as the film ''[[Manhunter (film)|Manhunter]]'' (1986), Lecter, as portrayed by [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], was not presented as a cannibal. In later adaptations, such as  ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991), wherein the character is played by [[Anthony Hopkins|Sir Anthony Hopkins]], Lecter's cannibalistic tendencies are made more explicit, earning him the nickname &quot;Hannibal the Cannibal&quot;.

===In science fiction===
In addition to the aforementioned uses, occasionally works of science fiction include elements of cannibalism that serve another purpose. For example, in ''[[The Book of the New Sun]]'' by [[Gene Wolfe]], cannibalism and drugs are used in order to gain the memories of dead people. In the book ''[[Peeps (novel)|Peeps]]'' by [[Scott Westerfeld]], people become cannibals when they are infected by a parasite. The post-apocalyptic novel ''[[Lucifer's Hammer]]'' by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]], features a band of survivors from a comet impact turning to cannibalism not only as a means of food, but also as a way of binding members to their group.  ''[[Courtship Rite]]'' by  [[Donald Kingsbury]] explores a human culture planted on a world whose biochemistry is toxic to humans.  Cannibalism is an essential part of both social and religious life, as food is a precious commodity and the only significant source of meat are the humans themselves.

==In music==

&quot;Congo Man&quot;, a calypso song recorded in 1965 by [[Mighty Sparrow]], features a &quot;cannibal headhunter&quot; who preys on white people.  The singer envies the titular character, because &quot;he eat until his belly upset,&quot; while &quot;I never eat white meat yet.&quot;

In 1971, a [[Rupert Holmes]]-composed pop song named &quot;[[Timothy (song)|Timothy]]&quot; by [[The Buoys]] cryptically told the tale of two trapped miners who apparently resort to eating their companion.  After being banned on many radio stations, &quot;Timothy&quot; rose to no. 17 on the Billboard charts.  Later that year, [[Grace Slick]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]] explored the concept of cannibalism in a tongue-in-cheek rock song named &quot;Silver Spoon.&quot;  The song appeared on ''[[Sunfighter]],'' a non-group album issued by Slick and bandmate [[Paul Kantner]].     

&quot;Mr. Green Genes&quot; by [[Frank Zappa]] (from the [[The Mothers of Invention|Mothers of Invention]] album ''[[Uncle Meat]]'') makes a humorous reference to cannibalism: ''&quot;Eat the truck &amp; driver / And his gloves / NUTRITIOUSNESS! DELICIOUSNESS! WORTHLESSNESS!&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalia.net/donlope/fz/lyrics/Uncle_Meat.html#Green Uncle Meat&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], especially [[death metal]] and [[grindcore]], bands (As well as [[horrorcore]] rappers) discuss cannibalism in their songs, or depict it on the cover art of their albums, because of the act's taboo nature. Sometimes bands are inspired by particular cases of cannibalism.

American death metal band [[Cannibal Corpse]] are one notable example. [[Eaten Back to Life|Their first album]], according to the inlay, was dedicated to &quot;the memory of Alfred Packer, the first American cannibal (R.I.P.)&quot;; their third album, ''[[Tomb of the Mutilated]]'', features quotations from serial killer and cannibal [[Albert Fish]] in the liner notes. Many of their songs make use of cannibalistic imagery, such as &quot;Edible Autopsy&quot;. The band [[Pungent Stench]] have also frequently dealt with cannibalism, most extensively on their 1990 EP ''For God Your Soul...For Me Your Flesh''.

The [[Armin Meiwes]] cannibalism case in Germany provided the inspiration for a number of metal bands. Rammstein's 2004 single &quot;[[Mein Teil]]&quot;, which featured the refrain &quot;you are what you eat,&quot; was based on the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rammsteinniccage.com/media/press/timesonlinejan05en.html|title=Shock'n'roll circus|date=2005-01-29|work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalist [[Till Lindemann]] explained the fascination with the case that provoked the band to writing the song: &quot;It's so sick that it becomes fascinating and there just has to be a song about it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gmax.co.za/feel04/08/27-germanycanibal.html|title=German cannibal inspires hard rockers Rammstein to new hit|date=2004-08-24|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs influenced by Meiwes include &quot;The WÃ¼stenfeld Man Eater&quot; by American [[death metal|death]]/[[thrash metal]] band [[Macabre (band)|Macabre]], &quot;[[Eaten (song)|Eaten]]&quot; by Swedish death metal band [[Bloodbath]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternative-zine.com/interviews/en/33 Interview with: Bloodbath's Jonas Renkse]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Let me Taste your Flesh&quot; by Spanish death metal band [[Avulsed]], as well as &quot;Cannibal Anthem&quot; by German electro-industrial project [[Wumpscut|:wumpscut:]], &quot;Cannibals of Rotenburg&quot; by the dirge-country band Sons of Perdition, and &quot;Menschenfresser [Eat Me]&quot; by electro-industrial act [[Suicide Commando]]. &quot;Human Consumption&quot; by hip-hop artist [[Necro (rapper)|Necro]] also makes reference to the incident, and the title of the 2007 [[Marilyn Manson]] album ''[[Eat Me, Drink Me]]'' was inspired by the case.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Epstein. ''Feeding Frenzy'', ''Revolver'', reported by [http://www.mansonusa.com/php-bin/news/fullnews.php?id=419 The Heirophant] May 2007. Last accessed March 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;A Little Piece of Heaven&quot; by Avenged Sevenfold is about a man who kills and eats part of his girlfriend after she rejects him.

Rapper [[Brotha Lynch Hung]] has also written many songs concerning cannibalism, as exemplified by his 1994 album ''[[Season of da Siccness]]'', on which he styles himself as &quot;the Ripgut Cannibal&quot;.

The French industrial band [http://www.discogs.com/Nox-Killin-Drive-Power/release/230522 Nox] had a track titled &quot;Cannibal Night&quot; on their 1990 album ''Killin' Drive Power''. It's about a man who kills his whole family and eats the best parts of every member; at last, he eats himself.

The Gothic/Deathrock band Creaming Jesus' song &quot;Celebrity Cannibalism&quot; was inspired by the Jeffrey Dahmer case, with an ending refrain: &quot;You always eat the ones you love.&quot;

&quot;Kiss Me, Hold Me and Eat Me&quot; by [[Ballboy (band)|Ballboy]], an Edinburgh band, features a poignant love affair between two cannibals, who know that their first kiss could prove fatal.

Pop Artist [[Ke$ha]] sings &quot;Cannibal&quot; which is about a literal man eater.

Dark singer [[Voltaire]] sings 'Cannibal Buffet' where he washes up on an island and gets eaten by the locals.

** In the ''[[Lifeboat sketch]]'', five sailors in a lifeboat bicker about the menu planning involving who should be eaten first. The skit is followed by the reading of a &quot;protest letter&quot; saying, &quot;As a naval officer I abhor the implication that the [[Royal Navy]] is a haven for cannibalism. It is well known that we now have the problem relatively under control, and that it is the [[RAF]] who now suffer the largest casualties in this area.

** In the ''[[Expedition to Lake Pahoe]]'' sketch, Vice Admiral Sir John Cunningham addresses the audience with the ''non sequitur'' &quot;and may I take this opportunity of emphasizing that there is no cannibalism in the British Navy. Absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is a certain amount, more than we are prepared to admit, but all new [[Naval rating#Royal Navy|ratings]] are warned that if they wake up in the morning and find toothmarks at all anywhere on their bodies, they're to tell me immediately so that I can immediately take every measure to hush the whole thing up. And, finally, [[necrophilia]] is right out. Now, this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of cannibalism and necrophilia in ... this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of unusual marine life in the as yet uncharted [[Lake Pahoe]].&quot; Later in the skit, Sir John has to block our view of a naval rating about to bite into a human leg.
