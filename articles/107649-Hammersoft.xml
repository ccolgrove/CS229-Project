==History==

{{advert|section|a tourist brochure|date=November 2011}}

[[Lancaster]] was the first community settled in the Antelope Valley. The community of Lancaster was settled in the late 19th century by  M.L. Wicks, a real estate developer who purchased six sections of land from the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (now merged into the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]). The origin of the city's name is uncertain, but it is presumed to be named after [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], or, more likely, the original [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in [[Lancashire]], [[England]].Born in the late 1800's as a prosperous community along the new Southern Pacific Railroad between Los Angeles and San Francisco, Lancaster, California has evolved from a farming community to a host city to one of the premier aviation research and development regions of the nation. Lancaster, with a population of over 150,000 residents and located at an elevation of 2350 feet above sea level, is the hub of the Antelope Valley and home to the beauty and clear blue skies of the California High Desert. No longer a locals &quot;best kept family secret&quot;, Lancaster has grown into a bustling urban destination, while offering visitors an array of outdoor experiences with the backdrop of four seasons, local shopping, dining and entertainment, and at the same time keeping its small town friendly charm. 

Early in its history, Lancaster was little more than a whistle-stop on the Southern Pacific Railroad between [[San Francisco]] and Los Angeles, with one hotel, the Gilwyn (known today as the Western Hotel), and a handful of homes. The settlement grew quickly, however, and by 1890, Lancaster was quite prosperous. The town experienced another small boom at the turn of the 20th century when gold and [[borax]] were discovered simultaneously in the mountains around the Antelope Valley. With the advent of the [[aerospace industry]] came the groundwork for the modern city growth. In 1933 the [[United States Army Air Corps]] began conducting flight and weapons tests at Muroc Army Air Field (now [[Edwards Air Force Base]]) and Lancaster has grown steadily since that time. It is home to many employees of Edwards Air Force Base, as well as to employees of [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and [[Northrop Grumman]], all of which have manufacturing facilities at [[Plant 42|U.S. Air Force Plant 42]] which is south of the Lancaster city limits.

Lancaster is proud of its record of achievement and progress since its incorporation in 1977. Now, with the distinction as one of Los Angeles County's most business friendly cities, Lancaster strives to provide a friendly, safe quality of life for residents and visitors. With the dedication of its citizens and community leaders, Lancaster continues to be a great place to live, work and raise families. Its partnership with government, education, business and civic leaders allows Lancaster to move forward as one of the most visionary cities in California. 

Lancaster is proud of its aviation heritage and entrepaneurial spirit. With the impetus of its Main Street Downtown revitalization, The BLVD, Lancaster invites visitors to stay and experience Destination Lancaster, where people come together to experience the exhilarating diversity of open spaces and the invigorating energy of urban places.

==Recreation and culture==
[[Image:Clear channel stadium-070125-01.jpg|left|thumb|right|[[Clear Channel Stadium]], home of the [[Lancaster JetHawks]]]][[Image:Awoh-06-8.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing Plaza, Aerospace Walk of Honor]]

The BLVD project was completed in 2010 and consists of Lancaster Blvd from 10th Street West to Sierra Highway. The multiple festivals have attracted huge crowds in the tens of thousands.

The city is also home to the Lancaster [[Aerospace Walk of Honor]]. Established in 1990 by the Lancaster City Council, the Aerospace Walk of Honor celebrates [[test pilot]]s who were associated with [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. Recognition is awarded for distinguished aviation careers marked by significant and obvious achievements beyond one specific accomplishment. The sidewalk monuments are dedicated to a distinguished group of internationally known experimental test pilots. Five honorees are inducted each year in a special ceremony held in September.

For residents and visitors seeking a cultured evening out, the Lancaster Performing Arts Center provides a varied array of fine arts from [[community theatre]] productions to [[classical music]] and various forms of dance.

Lancaster's location in Southern California's high desert also offers easy access to a variety of outdoor activities year around. In the winter, the local mountains offer [[skiing]] and [[snow boarding]] within easy driving distance. In the summer, access to interstate freeways gives residents the opportunity for day-trips to the Pacific Coast, while perennial blue skies allow [[hiking]], [[backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]] and [[cycling]] year-round.

The city also has a skateboarding park, located on its east side. Skate UniverCity is associated with the local rideshop, [http://www.pharmacyboardshop.com/ Pharmacy Boardshops].

The [[Musical road#Civic Musical Road|Civic Musical Road]] sings the &quot;[[William Tell Overture]],&quot; also known as the theme to the 1950s television show ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''. It was first put in by [[Honda]] for a television commercial. After noise and safety complaints, it was paved over two weeks later. After complaints in favor of the road, the musical road was reinstalled in a new location, at 30th Street West and Avenue G, near Fox Airport and Apollo County Park, completed October 17, 2008. While it plays the same song, it is now two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) away from the nearest residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Linebaugh| first =Kate| title =Good Vibrations?

In October 2010, the event was held along the newly revitalized BLVD and expanded to 3 days of festivities, boasting an attendance of 35,000. The event is accompanied by a street festival, live music, and a car show.

In April of each year the &quot;Antelope Valley Gem and Mineral Club&quot; hosts its annual gem and mineral show.  This show usually takes place the last weekend of April at the Lancaster High School grounds.  This event usually draws many visitors and local residents as it is a unique opportunity to see rare rocks, gemstones, specimens and hand made goods such as cabochons, faceted stones and hand made jewelry.
