'''Angus McKinnon Young''' (born 31 March 1955) is a Scottish-born Australian musician, and the lead guitarist, songwriter, and [[co-founder]] of the [[rock and roll]] band [[AC/DC]]. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] along with other members of AC/DC in 2003 and is known for his energetic performances, schoolboy-uniform stage outfits, and his popularization of [[Chuck Berry|Chuck Berry's]] [[duckwalk]]. In 2003, [[Rolling Stone magazine]] ranked Angus Young at # 96 in their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2011 he was ranked as the 24th best guitarist on their new list of 100 greatest guitarists.

==Life and career==
Angus Young (1955), the youngest of seven children of William Young (1911â1985) and Margaret Young (1913â1988), was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland. Prior to turning 15, he had already dropped out of school.&lt;ref name=gibsoncom&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Russell|title=10 Things You Might Not Know About AC/DCâs Angus Young|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/angus-young-0726-2011/|publisher=[[Gibson]]|accessdate=4 August 2011|date=26 July 2011|quote=Young left school before his 15th birthday.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved with his parents to Sydney, Australia in 1963 with his older brothers [[Malcolm Young|Malcolm]] and [[George Young (rock musician)|George]], who also became musicians, and their older sister Margaret. Older brother [[Alexander Young (musician)|Alex]], another musician, stayed in Scotland. Angus first started playing on [[banjos]] but re-strung them with six strings. Angus first started playing guitar on a cheap acoustic model purchased second-hand by his mother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classic-rock-legends-start-here.com/gibson-sg.html/ Interview with Angus Young]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angus's first Gibson SG was bought second-hand circa 1970 from a music shop just down the street from his home:
{{cquote|I got out and got a Gibson SG that I played until it got wood rot because so much sweat and water got into it. The whole neck warped. I bought it second-hand, it was about a '67. It had a real thin neck, really slim, like a Custom neck. It was dark brown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classic-rock-legends-start-here.com/gibson-sg.html/ Angus Young interview with Steven Rosen]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Formation of AC/DC===
Prior to forming AC/DC, Young played in a local group called Kantuckee. Kantuckee's lineup included Bob McGlynn (vocals), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass) &amp; Trevor James (drums). This was the first band to record Demo takes for Stevie Wrights classic &quot;Evie&quot; at the request of George Young. The band split and was later called Tantrum with the following line up: Mark Sneddon (vocals-guitar), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass) and Trevor James (drums).. He was 18 when he and his 20 year old brother Malcolm formed AC/DC in 1973 with Angus on lead guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, [[Colin Burgess (musician)|Colin Burgess]] on drums, [[Larry Van Kriedt]] on bass guitar and [[Dave Evans (singer)|Dave Evans]] on vocals. ''Can I Sit Next To You Girl'', their first single, was later re-recorded with [[Bon Scott]] as their vocalist. Many say they got the name AC/DC after seeing the letters &quot;AC/DC&quot; on the back of a sewing machine owned by their sister, Margaret. Others credit the name to George Young's wife, Sandra.&lt;ref name=&quot;mengleheart&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=AC/DC Maximum Rock &amp; Roll: The Ultimate Story of the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-06-113391-6 | author=Engleheart,Murray; Durieux, Arnaud | pages=50â51}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Angus tried a number of stage costumes, such as [[Spider-Man]], [[Zorro]], a [[gorilla]], and a parody of [[Superman]], named Super-Ang,&lt;ref name=&quot;cwalker&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott | year=2001 | isbn=1-891-24113-3 | author=Walker, Clinton | pages=128â133}}&lt;/ref&gt; before settling on his signature schoolboy look. To match this image the press and public were told that Young was born in 1959, not 1955. The original uniform was from his secondary school, [[Ashfield Boys High School]] in Sydney. By 1973, Angus had long left school. His sister Margaret suggested he wear the uniform after Malcolm asked each band member to come up with their own gimmick. Angus would come home from school and not change out of his uniform and practice his guitar playing for hours. His sister Margaret thought it odd to see him playing guitar in his school uniform, but suggested Angus wear the outfit on stage. The first satchel that Angus wore on stage was a brown, leather satchel purchased from a shop called &quot;Express Shoe Repairs&quot;, in the suburb where Angus lived (still in existence today). The satchel has a stamp inside bearing the name of the shop.

===Personal life and recent events===
Although Young prefers to keep his life private and out of the media, it is known that he lives in Kangaroo Point in the Sutherland Shire, in Sydney, Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/people/wedding-setback-for-kyle/2008/09/19/1221331200727.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Wedding setback for Kyle}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also has a home in [[Aalten]], Netherlands where his wife grew up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=The Daily Telegraph | work=AC/DC Stars Mega Mansion |url=http://www.news.com.au/sundaytelegraph/story/0,22049,21164917-5001026,00.html | first=Fiona | last=Hudson | date=4 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young married his Dutch wife, Ellen, in 1980 shortly before [[Bon Scott]] died at the age of 33 after a night of heavy drinking in London. Although a smoker, Angus is a well-known [[teetotaller]].&lt;ref name=gibsoncom /&gt;

On 24 August 2006, Young received ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine's Legend Award from the editor, Paul Brannigan. Brannigan called AC/DC &quot;one of the most important and influential rock bands in history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1858016,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lostprophets on their metal as they top the Kerrang! awards | first=Mark | last=Brown | date=25 August 2006 | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==

===Guitars===
Angus Young has used [[Gibson SG]]s in various forms (his original, and the basis for his current signature model, was a 1970â72 SG) throughout his career. He also used a modified version of the SG called the Jaydee SG, which was made custom for Angus by Jaydee guitars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaydeeguitars.com/angus.php |title=Angus Young AC/DC jaydee SG guitar, |publisher=Jaydeeguitars.com |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jaydee SG featured signature lightning bolt inlays on the fretboard. Gibson made a custom SG for Angus with lightning bolt inlays to replace the Jaydee SG. He is rarely seen with another guitar, though he also owns Fender [[Telecaster]]s, [[Gibson Firebird]]s and [[ES-335]]s. When AC/DC played a jam of &quot;Rock me Baby&quot; with the [[Rolling Stones]] in 2003, he played a Gibson ES-355 borrowed from [[Keith Richards]], perhaps one of the few times he was without an SG onstage. Young's 1970 SG has T Top pickups. Another 1964 SG that he used on the recording of Ballbreaker, has patent # pickups. All of these are vintage-output [[Alnico]] II or V pickups with matched coils typically reading 7.5k ohm. All of his pickups &quot;...are the original ones that came on the guitar(s).&quot; Angus uses Ernie Ball SUPER SLINKY Nickel Wound guitar strings (RPS-9 being gauges .009-.042).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ernieball.com/artist/24-Angus-Young#/product/RPS-9-Slinky-Nickel-Wound-009---042/ |title=Ernie Ball RPS-9 |publisher=Ernieball.com |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also using Ernie Ball regular slinky str. gauge 10-46

===Angus Young SG===
Angus Young and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] have collaborated to make the Angus Young SG. It features a pickup designed by Young himself (the Angus Young Signature Humbucker) in the bridge position, and a '57 Classic [[Humbucker]] in the neck. The neck has &quot;lightning bolt&quot; inlays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/SG/Gibson-USA/Angus-Young-SG.aspx/ |title=Angus Young Signature SG |publisher=Gibson.com |date=24 June 2008 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amplifiers===
Young mainly uses a reissued version of the [[Marshall 1959]] with model 1960 AX and BX 4x12 cabinets loaded with Celestion G12M &quot;Greenbacks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Celestion Artists&quot;&gt;[http://professional.celestion.com/guitar/features/partners/index.asp/ Celestion Artists]{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Angus Young has stated that he first began playing guitar when, &quot;I was little, teeny. I would sort of dabble around five or six years old. That's when I started hearing [[Little Richard]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;acdcwillie.tripod.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acdcwillie.tripod.com/interview5b.htm |title=Angus Young |publisher=Acdcwillie.tripod.com |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's energetic guitar style has been an influence on many young [[rock n roll]] guitarists. When Canadian band [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]] were asked what it was like to tour with AC/DC, they mentioned that Angus Young has a big heart and should bring AC/DC to Calgary.

In an interview with The Guitar Show, Angus noted his influences to include his brother [[Malcolm Young]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Freddie King]], while playing licks relating to [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[John Lee Hooker]] and [[The Kinks]] &quot;[[You Really Got Me]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Guitar Show television documentary, Segment: &quot;Upfront with AC/DC's Angus Young&quot;, 2001. Links 1 and 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPf8xHuV3Tc&amp;feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52mpf8FCBMo&amp;feature=related&lt;/ref&gt;
Young has indicated that he was also influenced by [[Keith Richards]],&lt;ref name=&quot;acdcwillie.tripod.com&quot;/&gt; as well as [[Chuck Berry]]'s style, including his banter with audiences, guitar playing and duck walk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Segment 2001&quot;&gt;The Guitar Show television documentary, Segment: &quot;Upfront with AC/DC's Angus Young&quot;, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
When the band would cover [[Chuck Berry]] songs in their early years, audiences would recognise the song, while noting their renditions were very different to the source material.&lt;ref name=&quot;Segment 2001&quot;/&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Angus Young - Toronto 2008.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Young plays a solo during a performance of &quot;[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]&quot;]]
Angus Young's playing style is very straight blues playing in both the minor and major [[pentatonic]] [[twelve bar blues]]. His style is spiced by additional non-blues tricks. In AC/DC's earlier recordings, [[power chords]] can be heard in songs such as &quot;[[T.N.T. (song)|T.N.T.]]&quot; and &quot;[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]&quot;. He also utilises touches of Scottish folk in his playing, and pull-off [[arpeggio]]s (pull-offs, played one-handed) are a popular trick, appearing in songs such as &quot;[[Who Made Who (song)|Who Made Who]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (song)|Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]&quot;, &quot;[[Sin City (song)|Sin City]]&quot;, &quot;[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]&quot; (live) . In 1976, the band recorded an instrumental arrangement of the Scottish traditional song &quot;[[The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond|Loch Lomond]]&quot;, retitled &quot;[[Fling Thing]]&quot;, which has appeared in their stage act over the years. The title refers to the [[Highland Fling]]. Young also provides backing vocals along with Malcolm and bassist [[Cliff Williams]] on songs such as &quot;[[T.N.T. (song)|T.N.T.]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (song)|Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]&quot;.

A common criticism of [[AC/DC]] is that their songs are excessively simple and formulaic. In reply, Young stated in an interview with the ''Atlanta Gazette'' in 1979:

{{cquote|It's just rock and roll. A lot of times we get criticised for it. A lot of music papers come out with: 'When are they going to stop playing these three chords?' If you believe you shouldn't play just three chords it's pretty silly on their part. To us, the simpler a song is, the better, 'cause it's more in line with what the person on the street is.}}

===Stage antics===
[[Image:AngusYoung-AMB.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Angus Young onstage antics at [[Scotiabank Place]] in [[Ottawa]] 2009]]

Angus Young is famous for his wild onstage antics: intense jumps and running back and forth across the stage while playing his guitar. Young would clamber on to Bon Scott's or Brian Johnson's shoulders during concerts and they would make their way through the audience with smoke streaming from a satchel on his own back, while he played an extended improvised guitar solo, usually during the song &quot;[[Rocker (song)|Rocker]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buoy.com/%7Ebonfire/angbon4.jpg Angus Young on Bon Scott's Shoulders during a concert].&lt;/ref&gt; with Scott or during &quot;[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]&quot; with Johnson. He frequently does [[Chuck Berry]]'s duck walk, as well as a kind of spasm, during which he throws himself to the ground, kicking, shaking, and spinning in circles, while playing the guitar. He first feigned a spasm to avoid embarrassment when he tripped over a lead at a gig.
