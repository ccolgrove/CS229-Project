'''Thompson''' is a city in northern [[Manitoba]].  As the &quot;Hub of the North&quot; it serves as the regional trade and service centre of northern Manitoba. Thompson is located {{convert|830|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the [[Canada â United States border]], {{convert|739|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the [[provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] capital of [[Winnipeg]], and is {{convert|396|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Flin Flon]]. It has a population of 13,256 residents, which also serves as a trade centre for an additional 36,000 - 65,000 Manitobans. As such, it has all of the services and amenities that would be expected in a much larger, urban centre.

== History ==
The Thompson area was first inhabited by nomadic Paleo-Indian hunters 6000 B.C.  Europeans conducted a federal geological survey in Thompson in 1896.

The modern history of Thompson began in 1956 when on February 4, a major [[ore]] body was discovered by use of an airborne electromagnetometer following ten years of mining exploration in the region.  The community was founded in 1957 following an agreement with the [[Politics of Manitoba|Government of Manitoba]] and  [[Vale Inco|Inco Limited]].  Thompson is  [[List of planned cities|planned community]] and is named after Inco's chairman, John F. Thompson.  The population has been estimated as high as 26,000 residents prior to the recession in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= Browne|first= Ray Broadus|others=Michael T. Marsden|title=The cultures of celebrations|publisher=Popular Press|date=June 15, 1994|pages=159|isbn= 0879726520|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RzmwsF-O3fIC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=%22king+miner%22+statue#v=onepage&amp;q=%22king%20miner%22%20statue&amp;f=false|accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1957 agreement required that Inco provide financial assistance towards the Kelsey Generating System, and a spur line to connect the community with [[Canadian National Railway|C.N]]'s Bay Line near Thicket Portage.  Thompson was incorporated as a town in 1967 on Canada's Centennial Anniversary, and in 1970 as a city in the royal presence of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]], having reached a population of 20,000.  A decline in population occurred during the following decades, levelling off around 14,000 people.  Thompson came to be known as &quot;The Hub of the North&quot;, as it functions as a centre for politics and commerce in the region.

== Economy ==
=== Mining ===
Its most prominent local industry is the [[mining]], [[Mill (grinding)|milling]], [[smelting]] and [[refining]] of [[nickel]], with additional nickel concentrates coming from [[Voisey's Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Voisey's Bay]], [[Labrador]].

Aside from Vale Inco Ltd; Manitoba Hydro, [[Calm Air]], MTS and the provincial government employ the majority of the people in Thompson. A large portion are teachers and entrepreneurs as well.

Many federal and provincial government agencies have offices in Thompson.  Thompson has a large retail sector, providing such things as clothing for all ages, a pet store, jewelry stores, travel agencies, vehicle dealerships, and grocery stores. Calm Air Airlines and Perimeter Aviation provide direct service between Winnipeg and Thompson. There has been intermittent jet service to Thompson, with the runway at the Thompson Airport able to accommodate a Boeing 737.  No carrier has been able to supply long term jet service with both West Jet and Kanata, Ontario's [[First Air]] being unsuccessful at long term operations.

=== Transportation ===
[[Thompson Transit]] is the public transit service operated for the city by Grey Goose Bus Lines.  VIA Rail provides passenger service at the [[Thompson railway station]] which is on the [[Hudson Bay Railway]].

The city is served by [[Thompson Airport]].

=== Cold weather testing ===
Due to Thompson's [[subarctic climate]], the city has earned a reputation for its cold weather testing conditions.  Automobile manufacturers such as [[Chrysler]], [[Ford]], and [[Hummer]] have tested their vehicles in the winter months in Thompson.  In April 2009, the [[National Research Council of Canada]] announced that they will be partnering with the newly created Environmental Test Research and Education Center (CanETREC) to create a year round research facility which will specialize in testing aerospace designs in cold conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wd.gc.ca/eng/77_11259.asp Government Investment Supports Development of World Class Cold Weather Testing Centre in Northern Manitoba]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global Aerospace Centre for Icing and Environmental Research (GLACIER) ===
On April 16, 2009 in Thompson by then Premier of Manitoba [[Gary Doer]] announced an estimated $44 million first phase and a future second phase estimated at $38M project by Rolls-Royce Canada and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. On October 30, 2010, held{{Who|date=April 2011}} the official opening of the project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thompsoncitizen.net/article/20101103/THOMPSON0101/311039988/glacier-holds-grand-opening&lt;/ref&gt;

Operated and maintained MDS AeroTest
http://www.mdsaerotest.ca/

=== Other ===
A recent [[economic boom]] in the community has resulted in a shortage of [[affordable housing]]. Contributing to the economy are [[Vale Inco]] nickel mines and the [[Manitoba hydro#Recent and current projects|Wuskwatim generating station]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20081025/economic_boom_081025/20081025?hub=TopStories|title=Job boom is a housing bust for Manitoba city|accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Construction of the access road to Wuskwatim began in 2006, and construction of the hydro dam is ongoing with completion planned for 2012.

==Climate==
Thompson is marked by a [[subarctic climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classificationâ|KÃ¶ppen]] ''Dfc''), with long, bitterly cold winters, and short but warm summers. Monthly means range from {{convert|-25.0|C|1}} in January to {{convert|15.8|C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|-3.2|C|1}}.&lt;ref name = CCN /&gt; Though a majority of the annual precipitation of {{convert|517|mm|in|1}} falls from June to September,&lt;ref name = CCN /&gt; winter is by no means devoid of precipitation. Snow falls mainly from October to May, with generally small accumulation in June and September, totaling {{convert|186|cm|in|0}} per year.&lt;ref name = CCN /&gt;

== Education ==

The [[School District of Mystery Lake]] operates six Elementary Schools and one High School:&lt;br&gt;
Deerwood School, Burntwood School, Westwood School, Ecole Riverside School, Juniper School, Wapanohk School (Eastwood) &amp; [[R. D. Parker Collegiate]] (Thompson High School)

The district offers a K-12 [[French immersion]] program at Ãcole Riverside School, and a K-8 education in the [[Cree language]]. This immersion program begins at Wapanohk (formerly Eastwood) Community School. Students can continue the French program at the high school if they completed K-8 at Riverside, and there are basic Cree courses in grades 9-12 offered as well. R.D. Parker Collegiate also offers grade 10 and 11 courses in Native Studies and a grade 12 Native Law course. Full Cree-medium education does not, however, extend to the high school yet.

Since September 2009, the [https://www.dsfm.mb.ca/ScriptorWeb/scripto.asp?resultat=669949 Franco-Manitoban School Division] (DSFM) has expanded within Manitoba to include one K-8 elementary school in Thompson, Ãcole Communautaire La Voie du Nord. Located within Burntwood School, this district allows children to flourish in French with peers in a Francophone culture. 

Although there is some demand for a [[private school]], Thompson is not home to any at this time.

Thompson is home to one of the two main campuses of the [[University College of the North]], as well as the [[University of Manitoba]]'s Faculty of Social Work branch in the region.

==Attractions==
=== Shopping ===

Thompson is a major retail service centre for the Northern Manitoba region. The city has three fully enclosed shopping centres, Westwood Mall, Thompson Plaza and the City Centre Mall. In the 1980s, all three malls were fully rented and attracted well-known chains however, more recently they have had difficulty operating fully rented.

===Spirit Way===
[[File:2009-0520-CDNtrip003-Thompson-wolves.jpg|thumb|right|Several Spirit Way wolves, downtown Thompson.]]
In 2008, Thompson debuted the Spirit Way, a two-kilometre (1.25&amp;nbsp;mi) walking and biking pathway with 16 points of interest that highlight Thompsonâs art, heritage, culture, industry, geology, and scenery; two more points are planned. The pathway includes a large wolf [[mural]] painted by Charles Johnston, and is a reproduction of [[Robert Bateman (naturalist)|Robert Bateman]]'s painting &quot;Wolf Sketch&quot; (1990).  The {{convert|86|ft|m|adj=on}} x {{convert|62|ft|m|adj=on}} image is the largest photo-real mural in Canada, and sits on the 10 storey Highland Tower apartment block.  The building was chosen as it is the most prominent building on Thompson's skyline.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thompsonspiritway.ca/take-the-walk/points-of-interest/wolf-mural/&lt;/ref&gt; The project also includes the Spirit Way wolves, wolf statues painted by various sponsors and placed throughout the walk.

===Natural attractions===
[[File:Pisew Falls June.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pisew Falls Provincial Park]], located just south of the city.]]

Located approximately {{convert|42|km|mi}} south of Paint Lake is [[Pisew Falls Provincial Park]]. These are Manitobaâs second largest water falls. There is a {{convert|0.5|km|mi|sing=on}} trail that leads to a viewing platform, perfect for taking pictures of the {{convert|13|m|ft|sing=on}} high, year round falls. There is also a suspension bridge that spans the lower falls. This is the starting point of a seven-mile (11&amp;nbsp;km) hike that leads to the highest waterfalls in Manitoba- Kwasitchewan Falls. This trail is a difficult back-country trail, recommended for experienced hikers only.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/parks/popular_parks/northeast/pisew.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Located {{convert|32|km|mi}} south of Thompson on Highway 6 is Paint Lake Provincial Park. The park spans over {{convert|56000|acre|ha}} of Precambrian [[boreal forest]] and the lake itself is {{convert|5|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|25|mi|km}} long.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thompson.ca/spps/ahpg.cfm?spgid=20&lt;/ref&gt; With its numerous islands, enticing waters and rugged forests, Paint Lake offers 76 campsites and has the largest marina in Manitoba. The marina offers fishing guides, cabin, boat and canoe rentals, a restaurant and convenience store. Some features of the park include boat launches, beaches, playgrounds, a volley ball court, baseball diamond and fitness trail. In the winter there are groomed snowmobile trails, ice skating, toboggan runs, ice fishing and ice fishing derbies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/parks/park_maps/paint_lake/paint_lake_campground.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports ==
Thompson is home to the Norman Northstars hockey team. Thompson's minor hockey teams are known as the King Miners.

Jennifer Saunders, the current Canadian Women's Racquetball Champion, was born and grew up in Thompson, graduating from R.D. Parker Collegiate in 1994.

The high school teams are called the RD Parker Collegiate Trojans. The Trojans' rivals are the Hapnot Kopper Kings from Flin Flon and the MBCI Spartans from The Pas.

Every year in April, students from the six elementary schools in grades 4-8 compete in the Knights of Columbus Track Meet. Juniper School dominated KoC in the 1990s, and Westwood School has had a winning streak during the 2000s.

Thompson has a large 6-sheet curling rink called the Burntwood Curling Club. The BCC has hosted several zone and provincial competitions.

Thompson also is the birthplace of two [[NHL]] players, [[Curtis Leschyshyn]] and [[Jody Shelley]].

==Government==
[[File:2009-0519-CDNtrip-028-Thompson-CityHall.jpg|thumb|250px|City Hall]]

===Circuit Court===
Thompson is unique in being the judicial centre for a huge geographic area - ranging from [[Norway House, Manitoba|Norway House]] in the South to [[Churchill, Manitoba|Churchill]] in the North. The Thompson Judicial district covers 15 circuits and offers both Judicial Justice of the Peace Court as well as Provincial Court sittings.  Judges, Judicial Justices of the Peace, Clerks, Crown Attorneys and defence lawyers based in Thompson and Winnipeg regularly travel by small plane on circuit court to various remote communities and First Nation Communities to hold Provinical court.

=== Bylaws ===
There was a curfew bylaw (varying depending on age) for people under 18. [http://www.thompson.ca/dbs/publicworks/files/Adobe/Curfew.pdf]. The bylaw was rescinded after The Public Interest Law Centre and Mr. Ron Dearman filed a challenge to the validity of the Curfew on the basis of sections 15, 7 and 2(d) of the Charter, division of powers and the Municipal Act.[http://www.cba.org/Manitoba/About/About/awards.aspx][http://origin.www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/05/02/thompson-curfew.html]. In 2007 The City of Thompson contracted with Prairie Bylaw Enforcement to have its officers enforce The City of Thompson's bylaws.[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/manitoba/story/2007/10/16/thompson-bylaws.html]
