The first season following divisional realignment, the Niners won the new-look [[NFC West]] title with a 10â6 record; they swept new division rivals Seattle and Arizona while splitting with the Rams; the Niners lost to former division rival New Orleans. In the playoffs the Niners fell behind the [[New York Giants]] 38â14 but erupted with 25 unanswered points and survived a chaotic last-second field goal attempt by the Giants; the 39â38 win was the 26th playoff win in the team's history. The Niners lost the next week at [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]] and coach [[Steve Mariucci]] was fired. As of 2011, this is the last season the 49ers have reached the playoffs.  It was also the last true winning season for the 49ers until [[2011 San Francisco 49ers season|2011]], when they finally snapped their eight-year non-winning jinx.

====Notes====
This was the first time in 14 years that a game between the 49ers and Broncos was ''not'' nationally televised. Between 1989 and 2000, the teams met on national television four consecutive times, on four different networks: [[Super Bowl XXIV]] on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], a Saturday afternoon game in 1994 on [[NFL on NBC|NBC]], a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night game on ABC in 1997]], and a Saturday afternoon game in 2000 on [[NFL on Fox|Fox]].

The Steelers' comeback earlier in the day (36â33 over the [[Cleveland Browns]]) was matched by San Francisco's similar late drive, overcoming a 38â14 deficit by scoring 25 unanswered points in the second half. A last-minute Giants drive collapsed when [[Trey Junkin]] botched a field goal snap, leading to a desperation heave to the endzone that fell short.
