'''Debian-Installer''' is the [[installation program]] for [[Debian]]. It was originally written for the [[Debian]] 3.1 release (codename: âsargeâ), although the first 
[http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/News/2004/20040621 &quot;release&quot;] version of a [[Linux distribution]] it was used with was [[Skolelinux]] Venus (1.0).
It is also one of two official installers available for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]; the other being called ''[[Ubiquity (software)|Ubiquity]]'' (itself based on parts of debian-installer) which was introduced in Ubuntu 6.06 (codename: &quot;Dapper Drake&quot;).

It makes use of ''cdebconf'' (a reimplementation of [[Debconf (software package)|debconf]] in [[C (programming language)|C]]) to perform configuration at install time.

Originally, it only supported text-mode and [[ncurses]]. A graphical front-end (using [[GTK+]]-[[DirectFB]]) was first introduced in Debian 4.0 (codename: âetchâ). Since Debian 6.0 (codename: âSqueezeâ), it uses Xorg instead of DirectFB.
