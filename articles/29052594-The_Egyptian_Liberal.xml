== Plot ==
This episode is the second half of the two-part, Season 6 premiere. During a memorial service for the 97 people killed in the bus crash, [[Francine Smith (American Dad!)|Francine]] and [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan]] have a clash over how to raise [[Steve Smith (American Dad!)|Steve]] now that [[Hayley Smith (American Dad!)|Hayley]] has run off with Jeff. Francine wishes to be more lenient, but Stan is convinced that they need to be firm with him. They decide to have a [[BMX]] race to determine how to raise Steve. Stan falls down and severely injures himself at the start of the race, making Francine the winner. However, Stan creates a [[Human cloning|clone]] of Steve (after being inspired by Duper's clone after the real Duper died in a bus crash in the previous episode), setting up a new contest with Francine to determine who has better parenting skills. 

Francine raises the original Steve very passively, but Stan raises Steve's clone, Steve-a-rino, in a very strict fashion. Francine's parenting ends up turning Steve into a spoiled brat, while Stan's parenting makes Steve-a-rino incredibly athletically adept and successful at school. However, things soon go wrong when Steve-a-rino &amp;mdash; whom Stan's parenting has turned into a [[psychopath]] &amp;mdash; kidnaps Steve to pose as him and enjoy the original's lifestyle. However, once exposed, Steve-a-rino decides to kill Steve, with Stan and Francine chasing him to his lair, where he keeps stray cats to torture and kill. This leads to a confrontation and a fight between Steve-a-rino and Stan. Francine releases the cats from their cages and the cats attack Steve-a-rino, causing him to fall out a window and is presumably killed by the fall. Stan and Francine decide to raise Steve together again as they take their leave. Steve-a-rino survives, however, and finds himself at the mercy of one of the tortured cats after it obtained a gun; he defiantly tells the cat &quot;I'll see you in hell&quot; as it shoots him.

Meanwhile, Roger uses [[marijuana]] and pills so he can think like a stoned loser to track down Hayley and Jeff in [[Thailand]] in order to steal the money that Stan gave Jeff. When refused the money, Roger resorts to making an annoying noise in the presence of Hayley and Jeff, which eventually drives them crazy as they attempt to escape him. At the end, Roger gets the money at the [[Great Wall of China]], but discovers that Hayley and Jeff spent all the money trying to escape from him. Shrugging it off, Roger then moves on to his next adventure to [[India]], though he falls off the Great Wall from going through the [[Taj Mahal]] backdrop he erected.

==Cultural references==
* The song that played during Roger's skateboard scene was &quot;[[Electric Feel]]&quot; from MGMT.
* John Farnham's &quot;Thunder In Your Heart&quot; song from Rad was used during the BMX races.
* The song played during the 'Steve vs. Steve-a-rino montage was &quot;He's Frank (Slight Return)&quot; by The BPA, featuring Iggy Pop. This song is a cover of an older version that was first written/sung by The Monochrome Set.
* Steve-Arino is not shown being shot, making it possible that he is still alive and will come back as an antagonist in future episodes.
* Stan forbids Steve-arino to eat a Gardenburger
* The title is a likely reference to the Son of Sam serial killer.

==Reception==
Rowan Kaiser from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' rated this episode a Grade C, saying: So it seems that the âPart 1 of 2â last week was not completely a bait-and-switch. Still, although this claims to be the second part of a two, it's really not terribly related to the premiere. Hayley and Jeff are still married, yes, but they're consigned to a B-plot involving Roger tracking them down and getting the $50,000. This certainly wasn't as funny as last week's episode, but it didn't have a whole lot to recommend it either. Grade: C.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/articles/moneybarthow-cleveland-got-his-groove-backwelcome,46165/&lt;/ref&gt;
