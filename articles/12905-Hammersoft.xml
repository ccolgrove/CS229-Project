The '''goth subculture''' is a contemporary [[subculture]] found in many countries. It began in [[England]] during the early 1980s in the [[gothic rock]] scene, an offshoot of the [[post-punk]] genre. The goth subculture has survived much longer than others of the same era, and has continued to diversify. Its imagery and cultural proclivities indicate influences from the 19th century [[Gothic literature]] along with [[horror film]]s and to a lesser extent the [[BDSM]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;CÃ©sar Fuentes RodrÃ­guez &quot;Mundo GÃ³tico&quot;, pages 18 &amp; ss./pages 206 &amp; ss.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carol Siegel &quot;Goth's Dark Empire&quot;, pages 8-13 and ss.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cintra&gt;Cintra Wilson, &quot;You just can't kill it&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 17, 2008.

The goth subculture has associated  tastes in music, aesthetics, and [[Gothic fashion|fashion]]. Gothic music encompasses a number of different styles including [[Gothic rock]], [[Dark Wave|Darkwave]], [[Deathrock]], [[Ethereal Wave|Ethereal]], [[Neo-Medieval music|Neo-Medieval]] and [[Neoclassical (Dark Wave)|Neoclassical]]. Styles of dress within the subculture range from [[deathrock]], [[punk fashion|punk]] and [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] style attire, or combinations of the above, most often with dark attire, [[makeup]] and hair.

==Music==
===Origins and development===
The earliest significant usage of the term (as applied to music) was by Tony Wilson on a 1978 BBC TV program when he described [[Joy Division]] as Gothic compared to the pop mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;Park, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Gothic term was later applied to &quot;newer bands such as [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] who had arrived in the wake of Joy Division and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;   

yet, by the late 1970s, there were a few [[post-punk]] bands labelled &quot;gothic&quot;. However, it was not until the early 1981 that [[gothic rock]] became its own [[Music genre|subgenre]] within post-punk, and that followers of these bands started to come together as a distinctly recognizable movement. The scene appears to have taken its name from an article published in UK rock weekly ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'': &quot;The face of Punk Gothique&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Keaton |url=http://www.ukdecay.co.uk/pressSoundsGoth1.htm |title=The Face Of Punk Gothique |publisher= Sounds |date= 21 February 1981 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  written by Steve Keaton and published on February 21, 1981.
The opening of the [[Batcave (London nightclub)|Batcave]] in [[London]]'s [[Soho]] in July 1982 provided a prominent meeting point for the emerging scene, which had briefly been labeled &quot;positive punk&quot; by the ''[[New Musical Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scathe.demon.co.uk/batcave.htm ''Batcave'' club history] ''Scathe.demon.co.uk''. Retrieved April 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Batcaver&quot; was later used to describe old-school goths.

Independent from the British scene, the late 1970s and early 1980s saw [[death rock]] branch off from American punk in California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alicebag.com/dinahcancerinterview.html  Archived Interview with Ms. Dinah Cancer ] ''Alicebag.com''. Retrieved April 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The gothic genre===

The limited number of bands that began to embrace the Gothic rock genre included Bauhaus, [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[The Cure]],&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. pp429, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; early [[Adam and the Ants]],&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. pp421, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]],&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. pp431, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Southern Death Cult]],  [[Specimen (band)|Specimen]], [[Sex Gang Children]], [[UK Decay]], [[Virgin Prunes]], [[Christian Death]], and [[Killing Joke]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. pp435, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the mid-eighties, bands began proliferating and became increasingly popular, including [[The Sisters of Mercy]], [[The Mission (band)|The Mission]] (known as The Mission UK in the US), [[Alien Sex Fiend]], [[The March Violets]], [[Ausgang]], [[Kommunity FK]], [[Xmal Deutschland]], [[Dead Can Dance]], [[This Mortal Coil]], [[The Bolshoi]], and [[Fields of the Nephilim]]. The nineties saw the further growth of eighties bands and emergence of many new bands. [[Factory Records]], [[4AD]] Records, and [[Beggars Banquet Records]] released much of this music in Europe, while [[Cleopatra Records]] among others released the music in the United States, where the subculture grew especially in [[New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] and Orange Counties, California, where many nightclubs featured &quot;gothic/industrial&quot; nights. The popularity of 4AD bands resulted in the creation of a similar US label called [[Projekt Records]], which produces what is colloquially termed [[ethereal wave]], a subgenre of [[dark wave]] music.

By the mid-1990s, styles of music heard in goth venues ranged from gothic rock, deathrock, [[industrial music]], [[Electronic body music|EBM]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[experimental pop music|experimental]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[synthpop]] and [[punk rock]].

[[Image:Bauhaus concert.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]âLive in concert, February 3, 2006]]
Recent years saw a resurgence in the early positive punk and deathrock sound, in reaction to [[aggrotech]], [[Industrial music|industrial]], and synthpop, which had taken over many goth clubs, bands with an earlier goth sound are becoming popular. Nights like Ghoul School and Release The Bats promote death rock, and the [[Drop Dead Festival]] brings in death rock fans from around the world.

Today, the goth music scene thrives in [[Western Europe]] (especially [[Germany]]) with large festivals such as [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]], [[M'era Luna]], and others drawing tens of thousands of fans worldwide.

==Art : Historical and cultural influences==
===19th and 20th centuries===

The Revolutionary War-era &quot;American Gothic&quot; story of the [[Headless Horseman]], immortalized in [[Washington Irving]]'s story &quot;[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]&quot; (published in 1820), marked the arrival in the New World of dark, romantic story-telling. The tale was composed by Irving while he was living in England, and was based on popular tales told by colonial Dutch settlers of New York's Hudson River valley. The story was adapted to film in 1922, and in 1949, in the animated ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]''. It was readapted in 1980 and again in [[Tim Burton]]'s 1999 ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]]''. Burton, already famous through his films ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'', ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', and ''[[Batman]]'', created a storybook atmosphere filled with darkness and shadow.

Throughout the evolution of goth subculture, classic romantic, gothic and horror literature has played a significant role.  [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraft]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and other tragic and romantic writers have become as emblematic of the subculture as has using dark eyeliner or dressing in black. Baudelaire, in fact, in his preface to ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' (''Flowers of Evil'') penned lines that as much as anything can serve as a sort of goth malediction:

:''C'est l'Ennui! âl'Åil chargÃ© d'un pleur involontaire,''
:''Il rÃªve d'Ã©chafauds en fumant son houka.''
:''Tu le connais, lecteur, ce monstre dÃ©licat,''
:''&amp;mdash;Hypocrite lecteur,&amp;mdash;mon semblable,&amp;mdash;mon frÃ¨re!''

:It is Boredom! â an eye brimming with an involuntary tear,
:He dreams of the gallows while smoking his water-pipe.
:You know him, reader, this fragile monster,
:&amp;mdash;Hypocrite reader,&amp;mdash;my twin,&amp;mdash;my brother!

===20th century influences===
====Elements appearing in culture====
The influence of the gothic novel on the goth subculture can be seen in numerous examples of the subculture's poetry and music, though this influence sometimes came second hand, through the popular imagery of [[horror films]] and television. The powerful imagery of horror films began in [[German Expressionism|German expressionist cinema]] after the first world war and then passed onto the [[Universal Studios]] films of the twenties and thirties, and then to the horror films of the English [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Studio]].

By the 1960s, [[television|TV]] series, such as ''[[The Addams Family (TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and ''[[The Munsters]]'', used these stereotypes for camp comedy. The [[Byronic hero]], in particular, was a key precursor to the male goth image, while Dracula's iconic portrayal by [[Bela Lugosi]] appealed powerfully to early goths. They were attracted by Lugosi's aura of camp menace, elegance and mystique. Some people credit the band Bauhaus' first single &quot;[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]&quot;, released August 1979, with the start of the goth subculture,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. pp432, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; though many prior art house movements influenced gothic fashion and style, the illustrations and paintings of Swiss artist, [[H. R. Giger]] being one of the earliest. Notable examples of icons would later include several leaders of bands : [[Siouxsie Sioux]] of Siouxsie and the Banshees, [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of The Cure, and [[Dave Vanian]] of The Damned. Some members of Bauhaus were, themselves, fine art students or active artists.

[[Image:The Hunger film poster.jpg|thumb|200px|Film poster for ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', a key influence in the early days of the goth subculture.]]
Some of the early gothic rock and deathrock artists adopted traditional horror film images and drew on horror film soundtracks for inspiration. Their audiences responded by adopting appropriate dress and props. Use of standard horror film props like swirling smoke, rubber bats, and cobwebs featured as gothic club dÃ©cor from the beginning in The Batcave. Such references in their music and image were originally [[tongue-in-cheek]], but as time went on, bands and members of the subculture took the connection more seriously. As a result, morbid, [[supernatural]], and [[occult]] themes became more noticeably serious in the subculture. The interconnection between horror and goth was highlighted in its early days by ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', a 1983 vampire film, which starred [[David Bowie]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], and [[Susan Sarandon]]. The film featured gothic rock group Bauhaus performing ''[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]'' in a nightclub. In 1993, [[Whitby]] became the location for what became the UK's biggest goth festival as a direct result of being featured in Bram Stoker's ''Dracula''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.whitbyonline.co.uk/whitbyhistory/whitbygothfestivals.php | title = Whitby Goth Weekend &amp; Other Festivals | work = Whitby Online | accessdate = 8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postmodernism====

A literary influence on the gothic scene was [[Anne Rice]]'s re-imagining of the idea of the [[vampire]]. Rice's characters were depicted as struggling with eternity and loneliness. Their ambivalent or tragic sexuality held deep attractions for many goth readers, making her works popular in the eighties through the nineties.

The re-imagining of the vampire continued with the release of [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s book ''[[Lost Souls (Poppy Z. Brite novel)|Lost Souls]]'' in October 1992. Despite the fact that Brite's first novel was criticized by some mainstream sources for allegedly &quot;lack[ing] a moral center: neither terrifyingly malevolent supernatural creatures nor (like Anne Rice's protagonists) tortured souls torn between good and evil, these vampires simply add blood-drinking to the amoral panoply of drug abuse, problem drinking and empty sex practiced by their human counterparts&quot;{{Volume needed|date=February 2010}}, many of these so-called &quot;human counterparts&quot; identified with the teen angst and goth music references therein, keeping the book in print. Upon release of a special 10th Anniversary edition of Lost Souls, [[Publishers Weekly]]â the same periodical that criticized the novel's &quot;amorality&quot; a decade priorâ deemed it a &quot;modern horror classic&quot; and acknowledged that Brite established a &quot;cult audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA246975.html?q=poppy+z%2E+brite+lost+souls&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later media influences====

As the subculture became well-established, the connection between goth and horror fiction became almost a clichÃ©, with goths quite likely to appear as characters in horror novels and film. For example, ''[[The Crow]]'' drew directly on goth music and style. [[Neil Gaiman]]'s acclaimed graphic novel series ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' influenced goths with characters like the dark, brooding [[Dream (comics)|Dream]] and his sister [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]].

[[Mick Mercer]]'s 2002 release ''21st Century Goth'' explores the modern state of the goth scene around the world, including [[South America]], [[Japan]], and mainland [[Asia]]. His previous 1997 release, ''Hex Files: The Goth Bible'' similarly took an international look at the subculture.

====Visual art influences====
[[Image:Viona ielegems.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Belgian]] photographer [[:nl:Viona Ielegems|Viona Ielegems]] at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] in 2005]]

The goth subculture has influenced different artistsânot only musiciansâbut also painters and photographers. In particular their work is based on mystic, morbid and romantic motifs. In photography and painting the spectrum varies from erotic artwork to romantic images of vampires or ghosts. To be present is a marked preference for dark colours and sentiments, similar to [[gothic fiction]], [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] or [[Art Nouveau]]. In the Fine Art field, [[Anne Sudworth]] is a well known goth artist with her dark, nocturnal works and strong gothic imagery.

Some of the graphic artists close to goth are [[Gerald Brom]], [[Luis Royo]], [[Dave McKean]], [[Trevor Brown]], [[Victoria FrancÃ©s]] as well as the American comic artist [[James O'Barr]]. [[H. R. Giger]] of Switzerland is one of the first graphic artists to make serious contributions to the gothic/industrial look of much of modern cinema with his work on the film &quot;Alien&quot; by Ridley Scott.

==Ideology==
{{section OR|date=May 2011}}
Defining an explicit ideology for the gothic subculture is difficult for several reasons. First is the overwhelming importance of ''mood'' and ''[[Gothic aesthetics|aesthetic]]'' for those involved. This is, in part, inspired by [[romanticism]] and [[neoromanticism]]. The allure for goths of dark, mysterious, and morbid imagery and mood lies in the same tradition of Romanticism's [[gothic novel]]. During the late 18th and 19th century, feelings of horror and supernatural dread were widespread motifs in popular literature; the process continues in the modern horror film. Balancing this emphasis on mood and [[Gothic aesthetics|aesthetics]], another central element of the gothic is a deliberate sense of [[Camp (style)|camp]] theatricality and self-dramatization, present both in gothic literature as well as in the gothic subculture itself.

Goths, in terms of their membership in the subculture, are usually not supportive of violence, but are tolerant of alternative lifestyles that incorporate themes such as BDSMâalways involving consent. Violence and hate do not form elements of goth ideology; rather, the ideology is formed in part by recognition, identification, and grief over societal and personal evils that the mainstream culture wishes to ignore or forget. These are the prevalent themes in goth music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;&gt;[[ReligiousTolerance.org]]'s article on &quot;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/goth.htm Goth]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The second impediment to explicitly defining a gothic ideology is goth's generally apolitical nature. While individual defiance of social norms was socially risky in the 19th century, today it is far less socially radical. Thus, the significance of goth's subcultural rebellion is limited, and it draws on imagery at the heart of Western culture. Unlike the [[hippie]] or [[punk subculture|punk]] movements, the goth subculture has no pronounced political messages or cries for social activism. The subculture is marked by its emphasis on individualism, tolerance for diversity, and mild tendencies towards intellectualism and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], but even these ideas are not universal to all goths. Goth ideology is based far more on [[aesthetics]] and simplified [[ethics]] than [[politics]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Unlike punk, there are few clashes between political affiliation and being &quot;goth&quot;. Similarly, there is no common religious tie that binds together the goth movement, though spiritual, supernatural, and religious imagery has played a part in gothic fashion, song lyrics and visual art. In particular, aesthetic elements from [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] often appear in goth culture. Reasons for donning such imagery range from expression of religious affiliation to satire or simply decorative effect. Regardless, there is a general tolerance for religious beliefs, and everyone including strict Catholics, atheists, and polytheists are accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;

While involvement with the subculture can be fulfilling, it also can be risky depending on where the goth lives, especially for the young, because of the negative attention it can attract due to public misconceptions of goth subculture. The value that young people find in the movement is evinced by its continuing existence after other subcultures of the eighties (such as the [[New Romantics]]) have died out.

==Fashion==
{{Main|Gothic fashion}}
[[Image:Lady Amaranth.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Gothic Model Lady Amaranth]]
Goth fashion is stereotyped as a dark, sometimes morbid, eroticized fashion and style of [[clothing|dress]]. Typical gothic fashion includes dyed black hair, dark eyeliner, black fingernails, black period-styled clothing; goths may or may not have piercings. Styles are often borrowed from the [[Elizabethan]], [[Victorian era|Victorian]] or [[medieval]] period and often express pagan, occult or other religious imagery such as [[pentacle]]s or [[ankh]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ELipton1&quot;&gt;Eric Lipton [http://www.lettuce.org/clipgoth.htm Disturbed Shooters Weren't True Goth] from the Chicago Tribune, April 27, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which goths hold to this style varies amongst individuals as well as [[geographical locality]], though virtually all goths wear some of these elements. [[Fashion designers]], such as [[Alexander McQueen]] and [[John Galliano]], have also been described as practicing &quot;Haute Goth&quot;.&lt;ref name=cintra/&gt;
Goth fashion is often confused with [[Heavy Metal fashion]] and [[Emo]] fashion:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scathe.demon.co.uk/fastgoth.htm ''A Brief Guide to Goth''] ''Scathe.demon.co.uk''. Retrieved July 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; outsiders often mistake fans of heavy metal for goth, particularly those who wear black trench coats or wear &quot;[[corpse paint]]&quot; (a term associated with the [[black metal]] music scene).

==Controversy==

The gothic fascination with the [[macabre]] has raised public concerns regarding the psychological well-being of goths. The [[mass media]] has made reports that have influenced the public view that goths, or people associated with the subculture, are malicious; however this is disputed and the goth subculture is often described as non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8996-goth-subculture-may-protect-vulnerable-children.html |title=Goth subculture may protect vulnerable children |work=New Scientist |date=14 April 2006 |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two non peer-reviewed studies by the A.S.H.A. concluded a higher than average propensity toward violence, and for one of the papers, [[self-harm]], within the subculture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/121371835/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123358363/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals who have either identified themselves or been identified by others as goth have committed high profile [[violent crime]]s, including several [[school shooting]]s. These incidents and their attribution to the goth scene have helped to propagate a wary perception of goth in the public eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;ELipton1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;czfeyy&quot;&gt;Marcia Montenegro [http://www.christiananswersforthenewage.org/Articles_Goth1.html The World According to Goth] Christian Answers for the New Age&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture on the right, of Dyleski in the ninth grade, which shows him in makeup and long hair, was criticized by [[Ellen Leonida|his defense attorney]] as unfair and misleading, because by fall 2006 Dyleski's appearance had become more conservative and mainstream. The Dyleski trial sparked controversy over the goth scene.]]

===Violence attributed to goths===

Public concern with the goth subculture reached a high point in the fallout of the [[Columbine High School massacre]] that was carried out by two students, incorrectly associated with the goth subculture. This misreporting of the roots of the massacre caused a widespread public backlash against the North American goth scene. Investigators of the incident, five months later, stated that the killers, who held goth music in contempt, were not involved with the goth subculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/09/23/columbine/print.html Columbine retrospective]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dawson College shooting]], in Canada, also raised public concern with the goth scene. [[Kimveer Gill]], who killed one and injured nineteen, maintained an online journal at a web site, [http://VampireFreaks.com VampireFreaks], in which he &quot;portrayed himself as a gun-loving Goth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;side-line_Gill&quot;&gt;September 14, 2006.

Another school shooting that was wrongly attributed to the goth subculture is the [[Red Lake High School massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/nation/11200369.htm &quot;Shooter is described as 'Goth kid'&quot;], ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram|Star-Telegram]]'' (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Weise]] killed 7 people, and was believed by a fellow student to be into the goth culture: wearing &quot;a big old black trench coat,&quot; and listening to [[heavy metal music]] (as opposed to [[gothic rock]]).

===Violence against goths===

In part because of public misunderstanding and ignorance surrounding gothic aesthetics, goths sometimes suffer [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and [[Toleration|intolerance]]. As is the case with members of various other controversial subcultures and [[alternative lifestyle]]s, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTTimesgoldberg&quot;&gt;Carey Goldberg [http://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/01/us/terror-littleton-shunned-for-those-who-dress-differently-increase-being-viewed.html?pagewanted=2 &quot;Terror in Littleton: The Shunned; For Those Who Dress Differently, an Increase in Being Viewed as Abnormal&quot;]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Goths, like any other alternative sub-culture sometimes suffer [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], and, in many cases, physical violence for their involvement with the subculture.&lt;ref name = &quot;czfeyy&quot;/&gt;

In 2006, a [[Navy]] sailor, James Eric Benham, and his brother attacked four goths in [[San Diego]] [[California]]. One goth, Jim Howard, had to be rushed to the hospital. The perpetrators of this attack were found guilty in August 2007 on four related accounts, two of which were felonies, though Benham only spent 37 days in jail. During the trial, it was made clear that the goths were assaulted due to their subculture affiliation. This can be otherwise known as a &quot;hate crime&quot; though the San Diego courts did not recognize this attack as such at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://angst-zine.com/archives/106 Goths and Violent Crime] Gothic Angst Webzine. 8 Sep 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angst-zine.com/zineindex.php?id=75 Goth Help Us, San Diego] Gothic Angst Webzine. 1 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.livejournal.com/those_who_mourn/43011.html Vindication] Jim Howard sept 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 August 2007, a couple walking through Stubbylee Park in Bacup, Lancashire, England were attacked by a group of teenagers because they were goths. [[Murder of Sophie Lancaster|Sophie Lancaster]] subsequently died from her injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/6943848.stm Goth couple badly hurt in attack] BBC News-UK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Malkin and agencies [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/24/npark124.xml Woman 'attacked for being a Goth' dies] Telegraph.co.uk News&lt;/ref&gt;  On 29 April 2008, two teens Ryan Herbert and Brendan Harris were convicted for the murder of Lancaster and given life sentences, three others were given lesser sentences for the assault on her boyfriend Robert Maltby.

In 2008, Paul Gibbs, a Briton from [[Leeds]], [[UK]] was attacked by three men. He and his group of about 20 young goths were on a camping trip in the vicinity of Rothwell when two 18-year-olds (Quinn Colley, Ryan Woodhead) and one 22-year-old (Andrew Hall) raided, stabbed four of the men and robbed two women. Quinn Colley had previously appeared in a homemade clip rapping on his love of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rothwelltoday.co.uk/news/Video-Rothwell-thug-who-rapped.5348257.jp Rothwelltoday.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs was offered a motorbike ride by the attackers who at first insidiously befriended the group. On their way, they knocked Gibbs from the bike, rendered him unconscious with a helmet, and sliced off his ear. Afterwards, the attackers returned to the camp.

Colley and Woodhead were sentenced to at least 2.5 years of prison while Hall at least 4.5 years. Gibbs' ear was found 17 hours later, thus doctors could not immediately reattach it. Instead, they stitched it inside his abdomen with the hope that some of the [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] will re-grow. The ear could be reconstructed by using [[cartilage]] removed from Gibbs' [[ribs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alterophobia.blogspot.com/2008/09/mass-assault-on-goths-in-leeds.html Alterophobia.blogspot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rothwelltoday.co.uk/news/Rothwell-park-attack-Goth-victim.5348497.jp Rothwelltoday.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5500384/Man-who-had-ears-cut-off-had-it-stitched-to-stomach-to-save-it.html Telegraph.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,525826,00.html Foxnews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1192285/Man-ear-hacked-stitched-inside-stomach--surgeons-work-reattach-it.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Man whose ear was hacked off has it stitched inside his stomach... while surgeons work out how to reattach it | date=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-harm study===

A study published on the [[British Medical Journal]] concluded that &quot;identification as belonging to the Goth subculture [at some point on their lives] was the best predictor of [[self-harm|self harm]] and attempted suicide [among young teens]&quot;, and that it was most possibly due to a selection mechanism (persons that wanted to harm themselves later identified as goths, thus raising the percentage of those persons who identify as goths).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/bmj.38790.495544.7Cv1&lt;/ref&gt; The study was based on a sample of 15 teenagers who identified as goths, of which 8 had self-harmed by any method, 7 had self-harmed by cutting, scratching or scoring, and 7 had attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[British Medical Journal]] | title = Prevalence of deliberate self harm and attempted suicide within contemporary Goth youth subculture: longitudinal cohort study | author = Robert Young, Helen Sweeting, Patrick West | issue =   7549| pages = 1058â1061 | date = 2006-05-06 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.38790.495544.7C | url = http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/332/7549/1058 | pmid = 16613936 | volume = 332 | pmc = 1458563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vince&quot;&gt;{{cite news | work = [[New Scientist]] | title = Goth subculture may protect vulnerable children | date = 2006-04-14 | author = Gaia Vince | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8996-goth-subculture-may-protect-vulnerable-children.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc harm&quot;&gt;{{cite news | work = [[BBC]] | title = Goths 'more likely to self-harm' | date = 2006-04-13 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4905898.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors held that most self-harm by teens was done before joining the subculture, and that joining the subculture would actually protect them and help them deal with distress in their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;vince&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc harm&quot; /&gt; The authors insisted on the study being based on small numbers and on the need of replication to confirm the results.&lt;ref name=&quot;vince&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc harm&quot; /&gt; The study was criticized for using a small sample of goth teens and not taking into account other influences and differences between types of goth.&lt;ref&gt;Sources:
