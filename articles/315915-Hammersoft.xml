Sports in Puerto Rico can be traced from the ceremonial competitions amongst the [[pre-Columbian]] Native Americans of the Arawak ([[TaÃ­no people|TaÃ­no]]) tribes which inhabited the island to the modern era in which sports activities consist of an organized physical activity or skill carried out with a recreational purpose for competition. One of the sports which the TaÃ­no's played was a ball game called &quot;Batey&quot;. The &quot;Batey&quot; was played in &quot;U&quot; shaped fields two teams, however unlike the ball games of the modern era, the winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed.

The Spanish Conquistadores who conquered the island introduced various sports such as [[horse racing]], [[cockfight|cockfighting]], [[dominoes]] and a game similar to &quot;Bowling&quot; called &quot;Boliche&quot;. The Spaniards however did not participate in team sports. 

Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States as a result of their defeat in the 1898 [[Spanish-American War]]. American soldiers who organized games as part of their training introduced the sport of Boxing and Basketball to the people of Puerto Rico, however the sport of Baseball which was invented in the United States was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States.

Puerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation even though is a territory of the United States. Puerto Rico as participated as such since the 1948 Summer Olympics celebrated in London. The following is the list and history of the most common sports practiced in Puerto Rico and the Puerto Rican who have excelled in those sports.
==Brief history of sports in Puerto Rico==
===Pre-Columbian era===
[[File:Tibes.JPG|thumb|150px|left|View of the Indigenous ballparks in the Tibes]]
The TaÃ­nos who inhabited Puerto Rico before the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, played a series of games which were both ceremonial and diversional, such as races, contests involving body strength and fishing. However, the two most important of these sports were the simulated warrior fights (similar to the gladiators) and ball playing. The ball game was played in a field, which they called &quot;Batey&quot;, situated in the middle of the village. The fields were either shaped like a triangle or like a &quot;U&quot;. The ball was made of vegetable leafs, which gave it flexibility. Two teams played against each other. The objective of the game was to keep the ball in constant motion. The players were allowed to use their heads, elbows, shoulders and knees. The team would lose a point, if for any reason the ball stopped moving. The score was kept with a mark on the ground and the game would end after the losing team received a certain amount of points. The winners were treated like heroes and the losers were sacrificed. The game had changed by the time the first Spanish settlers arrived. According to Fray [[BartolomÃ© de las Casas]] the game was played in the following manner: &quot;One team served the ball and the other team returned it, using anything but the hands. If the ball arrived at shoulder height, it was returned like lightning. When it came in near the ground, the player rapidly hit the ground, striking the ball with his buttocks. Play continued from side to side until an error was made.&quot; In 1975, [[archaeologist]]s from the Guaynia Society of Archeology and History at the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, members of the Archeological Society of the Southwest announced the discovery of the ruins of a &quot;Batey&quot; in an area called Tibes, on the outskirts of the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. A total of 9 ball fields were discovered under thick forest overgrowth dating back to [[Anno Domini|AD]] 25 in the area which is now known as &quot;[[Centro Ceremonial Indigena de Tibes]]&quot; (The Tibes Indigenoius Ceremonial Center). The site is now a tourist attraction and is open to the public. Artifacts found on the site are on display and can be seen in a museum on the site and in the Ponce Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;http://ponce.inter.edu/tibes/ingles/historia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish colonization===
The first Spaniards to inhabit the island were soldiers (Conquistadores), later they were followed by farmers, miners and their families. Team sports were virtually unheard of however, there were other types of competitions and sports in which they participated. The most common sports were [[horse racing]], [[cockfight]]ing and [[dominoes]]. The first horse track was built in San Juan in 1887. One of the most popular sports was &quot;Boliche&quot;. The men would gather in the town plaza and roll a small ball made of wood with the objective of knocking down pins. &quot;Boliche&quot; was similar to [[Bowling]]. Another popular sport was [[bullfighting]], which was limited to the larger cities of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].

===American (United States) colonization===
In the late 19th century &quot;new&quot; sports were introduced in Puerto Rico, after Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the [[Spanish-American War]]. Baseball, which was invented in the United States, was introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who learned the sport in the United States. The sport was also played by the American soldiers who organized games as part of their training. Puerto Ricans were also introduced to the sport of Boxing and Basketball by the occupying military forces.

Puerto Rico participates in the Olympics as an independent nation and therefore Puerto Rican athletes have the option of either representing Puerto Rico or the United States in the games. Some, such as Gigi FernÃ¡ndez in tennis, have won gold medals for the U.S.

The [[1948 Summer Olympics]] celebrated in London, was a historical one for Puerto Rico because it was the first time that the island would participate as a nation in a major international sporting event. The island's delegation consisted of only three members, two of which finished among the ten best in [[pole vault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/otros_accion/accion_deportiva/eran_otros_tiempos/215093| title=Eran otros tiempos| author=Alex Figueroa Cancel| publisher=Primera Hora| language=Spanish| date=2008-07-30| accessdate=2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their regional participations, the Puerto Ricans had carried the United States flag into the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/otros_accion/accion_deportiva/60_anos_de_olimpismo_boricua/214804| title=60 aÃ±os de olimpismo boricua| author=Alex Figueroa Cancel| publisher=Primera Hora| language=Spanish| date=2008-07-29| accessdate=2008-07-31}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States protested, claiming that two nations could not use the same flag at the same time. The decree of [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]] on July 25, 1952 would give the Puerto Rican delegation a flag of their own.

In 1980, the United States boycotted the [[Olympic Games]] celebrated in [[Moscow, Russia]]. [[German Rieckehoff]], who was then the president of the Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, was against the boycott because he believed that politics should not get involved with sporting events. He was, therefore, denied economic support from the local government. Rieckehoff did however, manage to send one athlete to represent Puerto Rico in [[boxing]], [[Alberto Mercado]], who became the only American citizen to participate in the 1980 Olympics.

In 1982, the [[Government of Puerto Rico]], headed by then governor [[Carlos Romero BarcelÃ³]], withheld economic support from the athletic delegation headed to [[Cuba]], where the Central American and Caribbean Games were going to be held. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee, under the leadership of Rieckehoff, had to appeal directly to the people for donations and were able to send the delegation. The Puerto Rican Olympic Committee is also the organization in charge of selecting the Puerto Rican athletes which represent the island in the [[Pan American Games]] and the Central American and Caribbean Games.

===Puerto Rico at the Paralympic Games===

==Distribution and practice among sports==

Others who have played in the NFL are O.J. Santiago of the [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Marco Rivera]] who now plays for the [[Dallas Cowboys]] and who in 2002 became the first Puerto Rican to play in the [[Pro Bowl]] as a member of the [[Green Bay Packers]] (the first of three appearances) and [[Glenn Martinez]] who in 2005 played for the [[Detroit Lions]], [[Ken Amato]] who currently (2007) plays for the Tennessee Titans and [[Alvin Pearman]] who currently (2008) plays with the Jacksonville Jaguars are of Puerto Rican descent. [[Aaron Hernandez]] of the [[New England Patriots]] is also of Puerto Rican decent.

====Early history of Baseball in Puerto Rico====
[[File:Old Pr baseball game poster.gif|right|150px|thumb|1924 poster announcing a game between a team from Puerto Rico (Porto Rico) and a team from New York made up of Puerto Ricans]]
During the late 19th century Puerto Rico was to witness the introduction of organized team sports. The game of [[baseball]] was first introduced to the island by a group of Puerto Ricans and Cubans who had learned the game in the United States. At first the sport was not well received by the local press and general public, it was looked upon as a silly game. The first two baseball clubs were founded in 1897. They were the Almendares Baseball Club, owned by Francisco Alamo Armas and the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPR&quot;&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://espanol.geocities.com/elpelotero_online/guante/puertorico.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+03:29:11  BÃ©isbol en Puerto Rico]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the daily newspaper &quot;El Pais&quot;, on January 11, 1898, the first organized baseball game was played in Puerto Rico at the old velodrome which was located at the Pda.15 in Santurce, San Juan. The Borinquen team beat the Almendares with a score of 3 to 0. The first game to go a complete nine innings was played on January 30, 1898 and the Borinquen once again beat the Almendares with a score of 9 to 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPR&quot;/&gt;

Puerto Rico became an American territory when the United States defeated Spain in the [[Spanish-American War]]. The American soldiers stationed in Puerto Rico were permitted to organize a baseball club to play against the local clubs as diversional outlet. On November 4, 1900 the Almendares Baseball Club composed of Puerto Ricans and Cubans beat the American Baseball Club of the Second Regiment of Infantry with a score of 32 to 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;BPR&quot;/&gt; In the early 1920s, teams from Puerto Rico, such as the San Juan Stars, would travel to New York City and play against some of teams there which included teams made up of Puerto Ricans who lived there.

====Early history of Basketball in Puerto Rico====
[[File:JJ Barea.jpg|right|150px|thumb|JosÃ© Juan Barea]]
The United States military government banned cockfighting and bullfighting from the island. They did, however introduce a &quot;new&quot; sport called basketball. Basketball was used by the American soldiers as part of their physical training. When the soldiers played basketball, they used a plain straw basket which was cut open at both ends and place it on the highest end of a pole. For a ball, they used a football and the game was played without any established set of rules.

In 1913, the [[YMCA]] of Puerto Rico oraganized the first game played using the official rules of basketball and in 1916, the YMCA organized the first basketball tournament in Puerto Rico. Teams organized in the other YMCA's in the island participated in the tournament. The first basketball organization in Puerto Rico was the San Juan Basketball League. [[RÃ­o Piedras, Puerto Rico|RÃ­o Piedras]] and [[BayamÃ³n, Puerto Rico|BayamÃ³n]] later followed and formed their own leagues.

Basketball became a popular sport in Puerto Rico, due in part to the [[National Superior Basketball|BSN]], which has been around since the 1930s. During the early 1980s, with many games shown on television, the sport's popularity increased. There is also a women's professional league, which is affiliated to the BSN. [[Street basketball]] is also popular among Puerto Rico's youth.
