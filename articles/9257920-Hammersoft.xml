{{Nihongo|'''''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl'''''|ããã¾ã ï½ã¬ã¼ã«ã»ãã¼ãã»ã¬ã¼ã«ï½|Kashimashi ~GÄru MÄ«tsu GÄru~}} is a Japanese ''[[Yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' [[manga]] series written by [[Satoru Akahori]] and illustrated by [[Yukimaru Katsura]]. The manga was originally serialized in ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'' between the July 2004 and May 2007 issues, and later published in five [[TankÅbon|bound volumes]] by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] from January 2005 to May 2007. The story focuses on Hazumu Osaragi, a normal, albeit [[Effeminacy|effeminate]] high school boy who is killed when an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[Unidentified flying object|spaceship]] crash lands on him, only to be restored to health as a girl. This results in a [[Lesbian|same-sex]] [[love triangle]] that Hazumu finds herself in with two of her best female friends.

A single [[light novel]] written by [[Mako Komao]] and illustrated by the manga's artist was published by MediaWorks under their ''[[Dengeki Bunko]]'' [[imprint]] in January 2006. The manga series was adapted into a twelve-episode [[anime]] television series plus a single [[original video animation]] (OVA) sequel by [[Studio Hibari]]. The anime aired in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] between January and March 2006; the OVA was released in October 2006. A [[visual novel]] was created based on the series for the [[PlayStation 2]] and was released in March 2006. [[Seven Seas Entertainment]] licensed the manga series for English-language publication in North America and released the five volumes between December 2006 and March 2008. [[Media Blasters]] licensed the anime series, including the OVA, and released three DVD volumes between June and October 2007 with English-subtitles. Media Blasters will re-release the anime with an English [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]].

The manga has been given positive reviews by the popular anime and manga magazine ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype USA]]'', and at the online resources [[Anime News Network]] and [[IGN]]. The first manga volume was ''Newtype USA's Book of the Month'' for December 2006, and ''Newtype'''s noted Seven Seas Entertainment's &quot;fan-focused&quot; translation without an effort to localize the humor for the mainstream American market. In July 2007, ''Kashimashi'' was Seven Seas Entertainment's best-selling title. The anime has been likened to [[Rumiko Takahashi]]'s ''[[Ranma Â½]]'', though only as far as the mutual [[transgender]] themes. Critics of the anime praised the down to earth characters, and the generally great animation quality with its soft and detailed art style.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters}}
At the start of ''Kashimashi'', a young high school boy named [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Hazumu Osaragi|Hazumu Osaragi]] declares his love to classmate and close friend [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Yasuna Kamiizumi|Yasuna Kamiizumi]], but she quickly rejects him. Dejected, Hazumu climbs Mt. Kashima and is killed when an [[Unidentified flying object|alien spacecraft]] accidentally crash lands on him. To rectify this, the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] in the ship named [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Hitoshi Sora|Hitoshi Sora]] brings Hazumu back to life, but inadvertently regenerates him as a female right down to the [[DNA]] level. This change in Hazumu serves as the catalyst for the development of character interactions for the remainder of the series.

After Hazumu returns to school, Yasuna unexpectedly professes her love for Hazumu, but this serves only to confuse Hazumu as she adjusts to her new life as a girl. Yasuna, a rather feminine girl, has a unique affliction which makes her incapable of seeing males, and instead sees males as covered in a gray, hazy blur. Hazumu's childhood friend [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Tomari Kurusu|Tomari Kurusu]], an athletic girl and [[tomboy]], finds Hazumu's change difficult to cope with. Tomari starts to realize her own romantic feelings for Hazumu as Yasuna starts becoming closer to Hazumu, especially after Tomari witnesses Hazumu and Yasuna kissing one day after school. A conflict arises between Yasuna and Tomari who fight for Hazumu's affection while she is unable to choose between them. This results in a [[love triangle]] emerging between the three female main characters. Hazumu's best male friend [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Asuta Soro|Asuta Soro]] also starts having romantic feelings for Hazumu, but tries his best to repress them. Tomari's good friend [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Ayuki Mari|Ayuki Mari]], an intelligent girl interested in the sciences, continuously observes the ongoing development of the love triangle while keeping a stance of watching from afar.

The very stoic Hitoshi originally came to Earth in order to study human emotions, especially those related to love, in an attempt to save his species from extinction. His species has long-since given up their emotions resulting in a loss of their sexual urges and thus a continuously dwindling population. Hitoshi moves into Hazumu's home where he is warmly welcomed by [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Hazumu's parents|Hazumu's parents]]. He brings with him an [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[gynoid]] named [[List of Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl characters#Jan Pu|Jan Pu]] which serves as the [[Autopilot|automatic pilot]] for his spaceship. Jan Pu's body is modeled after Hazumu's own female body, and possesses an energetic and childish personality.

While initially citing Hazumu's change as an accident, Hitoshi later realizes this was an unexpected result of the regeneration process. By the time Hitoshi becomes aware of his mistake, he tells Hazumu and her friends she has only one month left to live. Hitoshi explains to Hazumu's friends how someone very close to Hazumu has to donate &quot;life grains&quot; to Hazumu to sustain her life. While unaware her friends know about her impending death, Hazumu continues to live her life and comes to fully accept her fate. The day Hazumu is appointed to die, she falls off the school's roof and Tomari jumps off the roof in an attempt to save her. While in mid-air, Hitoshi interferes by transferring the necessary &quot;life grains&quot; to Hazumu, and both survive the fall. When they later wake up in the infirmary, Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari, effectively choosing her over Yasuna.

The [[anime]] ends differently, with no life threatening situation and Hazumu choosing Yasuna in order to help cure her worsening sight problem as it begins to degrade so she can no longer see girls as well. Afterwards however, Yasuna, who becomes able to see all people again, decides to reject Hazumu once more, saying she can stand on her own, and in the follow-up [[original video animation]] episode, Hazumu confesses her love to Tomari on Christmas and the two get married in a ceremony held by Hitoshi.

==Production==
When it was decided that ''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl'' would begin serialization in [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]]' [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''[[Dengeki Daioh]]'', [[Satoru Akahori]] wondered what kind of a message he could send to the readers, and eventually decided he wanted to write a steady message of &quot;true love&quot;. Akahori noted that up to the creation of ''Kashimashi'', the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love, and much of his previous work involved a lot of ''[[ecchi]]'' content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in ''Kashimashi''. He wondered if the story would be interesting, and if he could surprise normal readers and fans of his previous works, if he wrote a true love story without much ''ecchi'' or [[fan service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fan-book&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=ããã¾ãå¬å¼ãã¡ã³ããã¯ | trans_title=Kashimashi Official Fan Book | language=Japanese | publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] | year=2006 | month=March | isbn=978-4-840234-09-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When thinking on how to write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having [[Sexual intercourse|sex]]. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought up the idea of changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's [[gender]] would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of ''Kashimashi''. Afterwards, Akahori felt it necessary to expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.&lt;ref name=&quot;fan-book&quot;/&gt;

The title ''Kashimashi'' loosely translates as &quot;noisy, boisterous, or clamorous&quot; and is derived from the Japanese phrase, {{Nihongo|&quot;When three women gather, it is noisy&quot;|å¥³ä¸äººå¯ãã°å§¦ãã|Onna sannin yoreba kashimashii}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gomanga.com/news/features_kashimashi_01.php | title=Kashimashi: The Ultimate Guide | publisher=[[Seven Seas Entertainment]] | accessdate=April 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main title was originally romanized as ''Kasimasi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kasimasi.com/ | title=ããã¾ãï½ã¬ã¼ã«ã»ãã¼ãã»ã¬ã¼ã«ï½ | trans_title=Kasimashi: Girl Meets Girl | publisher=[[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]] | accessdate=December 6, 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with [[Kunrei-shiki romanization]], but this was later changed in the English adaptations to ''Kashimashi''&lt;ref name=&quot;English-manga-7seas&quot;/&gt; in accordance with [[Hepburn romanization]].

Three insert songs sung by the voice actors were used in three of the episodes.

===Visual novel===
A [[visual novel]] [[video game]] based on the series named {{Nihongo|''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story''|ããã¾ã ï½ã¬ã¼ã«ã»ãã¼ãã»ã¬ã¼ã«ï½ åãã¦ã®å¤ç©èª|Kasimasi ~GÄru MÄ«tsu GÄru~ Hajimete no Natsu Monogatari}} was first released on the [[PlayStation 2]] on March 30, 2006 in Japan.

The game's story begins on the outset of summer vacation. Hazumu's homeroom teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one week trip to a small mountain village with a hot spring resort. Hazumu's grandparents reside in this town, and are two new characters introduced to the story. Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu; two are the same age as her, and the third is the older landlady of the resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/ps2/kashimashi/character/index.html | title=ããã¾ããï½ã¬ã¼ã«ã»ãã¼ãã»ã¬ã¼ã«ï½ããåãã¦ã®å¤ç©èªãã | trans_title=''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' | publisher=[[Marvelous Entertainment|Marvelous Interactive]] | accessdate=April 19, 2007 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters. The gameplay's main system comes from Hazumu's indecisive personality. If the player shows more interest in a particular character, the other characters get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them, which is displayed in a tension meter. The more Hazumu ignores a particular character, the higher the tension between that character becomes. This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests. In order to view the ending of a particular character, a certain amount of tension will have to be between the other characters, but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show.&lt;ref name=&quot;system&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/ps2/kashimashi/system/index.html | title=ããã¾ããï½ã¬ã¼ã«ã»ãã¼ãã»ã¬ã¼ã«ï½ããåãã¦ã®å¤ç©èªãã | trans_title=''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' | publisher=[[Marvelous Entertainment|Marvelous Interactive]] | accessdate=April 19, 2007 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[gameplay]] requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either [[dialogue]] between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.mmv.co.jp/special/game/ps2/kashimashi/outline/index.html | title=ããã¾ããï½ã¬ã¼ã«ã»ãã¼ãã»ã¬ã¼ã«ï½ããåãã¦ã®å¤ç©èªãã | trans_title=''Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl The First Summer Story'' | publisher=[[Marvelous Entertainment|Marvelous Interactive]] | accessdate=December 18, 2008 | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect of the game (as in nearly every visual novel) are the &quot;decision points&quot; which appear every so often which give the player the chance to choose from a limited number of options.&lt;ref name=&quot;system&quot;/&gt; The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. The game pauses at such moments and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Each plot line can be achieved through multiple replays.

==Reception==
===Manga===
In July 2007, the English version of ''Kashimashi'' was [[Seven Seas Entertainment]]'s best-selling title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2007/anime-expo/seven-seas-entertainment | title=Anime Expo 2007 Seven Seas Entertainment | last=Santos | first=Carlo | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | date=June 29, 2007 | accessdate=July 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of the manga was given positive reviews from such sources as ''[[Newtype (magazine)|Newtype USA]]'', a popular anime and manga magazine. The first volume was named as ''Newtype USA'''s Book of the Month for December 2006, and the review noted Seven Seas Entertainment's &quot;fan-focused&quot; translation, which retained the honorifics and much of the Japanese wordplay without efforts to localize the humor for the mainstream American market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newtype USA&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=David F. |url=http://www.newtype-usa.com/reviews/index.php?itemid=345 |title=Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ Volume 1 |work=Newtype USA |volume=5 |issue=12 |page=p. 138 |month=December |year=2006 |issn=1541-4817 |archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20070224141333/http://www.newtype-usa.com/reviews/index.php?itemid=345 |archivedate=February 24, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review goes on to state that &quot;for fans of more mainstream romantic productions, it's a neat twist on the traditional love-triangle formula, and a charming alternative to boys meeting girls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newtype USA&quot;/&gt; In a review at [[Anime News Network]] (ANN), Carlo Santos commented that &quot;the fast-moving events of this first volume combine to form a story of many moods: a gender-bending comedy, but with sci-fi touches, and most of all, a romance more touching than one might expect. The time has come to rethink the love triangle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl-gn-1 | title=Kashimashi manga volume 1 review | last=Santos | first=Carlo | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | date=December 7, 2006 | accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review at [[IGN]], A. E. Sparrow stated &quot;there's plenty to enjoy in the first book, however. Hazumu attempting to buy his first bra is pretty humorous, as are the occasional visits from the aliens who put him in this situation in the first place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/766/766168p1.html | title=Kashimashi manga volume 1 review | last=Sparrow | first=A. E. | date=February 20, 2007 | publisher=[[IGN]]  |accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second volume of the manga was positively reviewed at Anime News Network by Theron Martin, who wrote: &quot;With its second volume the title pushes fully into the realm of romantic comedy, liberally sprinkling its story with humorous asides, pratfalls, and anecdotes while still dealing head-on with the much more serious and involved love triangle springing up around Hazumu. For all its attempts to be funny, though, it is the story's more dramatic side that will keep you coming back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl/gn-2 | title=Kashimashi manga volume 2 review | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | last=Martin | first=Theron | date=April 17, 2007 | accessdate=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ANN's review of manga volume three, Theron Martin wrote, &quot;The artistry of Yukimaru Katsura rarely devotes more effort to backgrounds than necessary, but its strength has always lain in the character designs and costuming. The array of the female cast provides a great contrast of looks [but] ... the male characters, though easily distinguishable, stand out less.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl/gn-3 | title=''Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~'' GN 3 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | last=Martin | first=Theron | date=August 17, 2007 | accessdate=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ANN's double review of manga volumes four and five, Martin commented, &quot;these volumes offer a solid conclusion to this lovely little ''yuri'' series. It does handle things rather differently than in the anime version, and those irritated by the anime's ending should find this one more to their liking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl/gn-4 | title=''Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~'' GN 4 and 5 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | last=Martin | first=Theron | date=May 16, 2008 | accessdate=December 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first manga volume was generally panned by Deb Aoki at [[About.com]] where she felt the characters were &quot;too flat and uninteresting&quot;, and the story being &quot;too far-fetched&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; to make a good story. However, Aoki admitted the art is &quot;quite nice, and there are some moments of genuine tenderness and humor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/reviews/gr/kashimashi1.htm|title=Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl Volume 1|author=Aoki, Deb|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of the first manga volume by Matthew Alexander at Mania.com, he thought that while &quot;stories with love triangles or gender-switching protagonists have been done before...Hazumu's change into a girl explores romance between people of the same sex in an interesting and comedic way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-girl-meets-girl-vol-01_article_83040.html|title=Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ Vol. #01|publisher=Mania.com|author=Alexander, Matthew|date=January 11, 2007|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anime===
The anime series has been compared with a similar series that involved gender swappingâ[[Rumiko Takahashi]]'s ''[[Ranma Â½]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANNreview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;themanime.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=990 | title=Kashimashi ~Girl meets girl~ review | publisher=T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews | accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, &quot;[the anime is] rather aggravating to watch at times, but seems to have no problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;themanime.org&quot;/&gt; The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of [[Yuricon]], an [[anime convention]] geared towards fans of ''[[Yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to ''yuri''. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as &quot;so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - after all these years of watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a ''yuri'' ending where the girl remains a girl and get[s] the girl and...thud. Nothing.&quot; The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://okazu.blogspot.com/2006/04/yuri-anime-kashimashi-girl-meets-girl.html | title=Yuri Anime: Kashimashi Girl Meets Girl | last=Friedman | first=Erica | publisher=Okazu | date=April 6, 2006 | accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three DVD volumes released by [[Media Blasters]] were reviewed by [[Anime News Network]]. In the review of the first DVD, the reviewer commented, &quot;The series' skillful juggling of different characters' viewpoints puts the audience in a position to sympathize strongly with each one. Director [[Nobuaki Nakanishi]] guides the emotional content with a light, gentle touchâwisely forgoing extensive internal monologues, speeches, and emotional outbursts. Instead, he draws you in with soft, effortlessly evocative visuals and a simple, beautifully understated score, relying on subtly shifting facial expressions and meaning-laden actions to communicate the quietly affecting emotional states of his characters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd1review&quot;/&gt; For the second DVD volume, Theron Martin commented, &quot;Every element of the production, from the style of the artistry to the palette of colors used to the soundtrack, contributes wonderfully to the look and feel of the original story, and the anime script not only exactly duplicates many scenes from the manga but also does everything in its power to stay true to the spirit of the original writing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kasimasi/sub.dvd-2 | title=Kasimasi Sub.DVD 2 - Triangles Hurt | last=Martin | first=Theron | date=September 3, 2007 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | accessdate=December 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, for the third volume, Carl Kimlinger wrote &quot;...the writers make an ill-advised attempt to remove the &quot;bitter&quot; from &quot;bittersweet&quot; by tacking on some decidedly unconvincing plot developments [in the OVA, although]...it isn't as awful as it could have been. The third volume of ''Kashimashi''...creat[es] a deeply satisfying conclusion with all of the vicarious emotional thrills you could possibly want.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/kasimasi/sub-dvd-3 | title=Kasimasi Sub.

The three DVD volumes released by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In the review of the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as &quot;something different from the norm&quot; which &quot;mixes romance and comedy quite well&quot;. However, the pacing early on is felt as being &quot;awkward&quot; which &quot;takes time to really find its rhythm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-1_article_79313.html|title=Kashimashi Vol. #1|publisher=Mania.com|author=Beveridge, Chris|date=May 9, 2007|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that &quot;the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show.&quot; Beveridge goes on to state &quot;the mild moments of it are tacky and bad,&quot; but &quot;when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-2_article_79442.html|title=Kashimashi Vol. #2|publisher=Mania.com|author=Beveridge, Chris|date=August 13, 2007| accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that &quot;despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, ''Kashimashi'' has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented.&quot; The series is seen to &quot;close out rather well,&quot; and &quot;not only is it good fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mania.com/kashimashi-vol-3_article_79443.html|title=Kashimashi Vol. #3|publisher=Mania.com|author= Beveridge, Chris|date=October 25, 2007|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
