'''The Noid''' (voiced by [[Pons Maar]]) is an advertising character for [[Domino's Pizza]] created in the 1980s. He was a [[villain]]ous red-suited character with red rabbit ears who attempted to ruin Domino's [[pizza]] but was constantly thwarted. The Noid was created in 1986 by Group 243, the advertising agency for Domino's Pizza and was animated by [[Will Vinton Studios]].  The creative team of Ernie Perich (creative director), Gary Bastien (art director), Dave Larson (producer), Matthew Thornton (producer), and Phil Kneesi (writer) created the character and the television campaigns.  Commercials that featured the character used the slogan &quot;Avoid the Noid!&quot;

As part of the advertising campaign, a computer game was released in 1989 called ''[[Avoid the Noid]]''. The object of the game is to deliver a pizza within a half-hour time limit, in an apartment building swarming with Noids (some of which are armed with heat-seeking or pizza-seeking missiles, or water balloons). The common version is version 1.0 and has [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] graphics and [[PC speaker]] sound effects, although version 1.1 also exists which added support for [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] graphics and [[Adlib]] music.  In 1990, [[Capcom]] released a different [[video game]], ''[[Yo! Noid]]'', for the [[NES]].

Also, the Noid has made a few appearances in modern-day entertainment, including an altercation in the episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' called [[Deep Throats]], in an episode of ''[[30 Rock]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tvfanatic.com/quotes/avoid-the-noid/ | title=Avoid the Noid! | publisher=TV Fanatic | accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a segment of [[Michael Jackson: Moonwalker]] and in two episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', once as a Thanksgiving Day parade balloon, and the other in person in the episode &quot;[[She of Little Faith]]&quot;.

Domino's brought the Noid back for a limited run of t-shirts in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noidtshirt.com/ Domino's Pizza AVOID THE NOID!

A limited run of 1,000 shirts was made.

== Return of the Noid ==
On May 4, 2011 the Noid was brought back as a promotional figure by Domino's to be used in a campaign on their Facebook page &lt;ref&gt;[http://photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/226368_336704829956_6657899956_1257846_6157818_s.jpg Domino's Pizza AVOID THE NOID!]&lt;/ref&gt; and made a brief appearance as a stuffed toy at the end of a May 2011 commercial promoting a one-topping pizza deal. The 25th Birthday of the Noid mascot is celebrated with a video game &quot;The Noid's Super Pizza Shootout&quot; homage to &quot;Avoid the Noid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.villagevoice.com/forkintheroad/2011/08/dominos_noid.php Village Voice: Domino's Digs up the Noid for One Week Only]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kenneth Lamar Noid ==
On January 30, 1989, Kenneth Lamar Noid, a [[mentally ill]] customer who thought the ads were a personal attack on him, held two employees of an [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Domino's restaurant [[hostage]] for over five hours. After forcing them to make him a pizza and making demands for $100,000, getaway transportation, and a copy of ''[[The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles|The Widow's Son]]'', Noid surrendered to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,151193,00.html | title=Business Notes: Advertising Characters | publisher=TIME | date=1989-02-13 | accessdate=2006-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident had ended, police Chief Reed Miller offered a memorable assessment to reporters: &quot;He's paranoid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-3926396.html Noid muffs Domino's robbery - Chicago Sun-Times | Encyclopedia.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Noid was charged with [[kidnapping]], [[Assault#Aggravated assault|aggravated assault]], [[extortion]], and [[Concealed carry in the United States#Weapon possession|possession of a firearm]] during a crime.
