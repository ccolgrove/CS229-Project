The '''1901 Michigan Wolverines football team''' represented the [[University of Michigan]] in the [[1901 college football season]]. In their first year under new head coach [[Fielding H. Yost]], Michigan finished the season undefeated with an 11â0 record, outscored their opponents by the unprecedented total of 550 to 0, and became known as the first of Yost's famed &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; teams. With a conference record of 4â0, Michigan shared the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] title with [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]], a team they did not face in 1901. The Wolverines concluded their season on January 1, 1902 by defeating [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]], 49&amp;ndash;0, in the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], the first college football [[bowl game]] ever played. The 1901 Michigan Wolverines have been recognized as [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|national champions]] by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], the Houlgate System, and the National Championship Foundation.

The 1901 Michigan team featured two future [[College Football Hall of Fame]] inductees, [[Neil Snow]] and [[Willie Heston]]. Snow was selected as an [[1901 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] by [[Caspar Whitney]] for ''[[Outing (magazine)|Outing]]'' magazine, and four Wolverines were selected for the All-Western team: Snow (fullback/end), Heston (halfback), [[Boss Weeks]] (quarterback), and [[Bruce Shorts]] (right tackle). The team's captain was left tackle, [[Hugh White (American football)|Hugh White]].

==Season summary==
===Overview===
[[File:Fielding Yost (1902).jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Fielding H. Yost]] took over as Michigan's coach in 1901.]]
[[File:Willie Heston (bentley image).jpg|thumb|right|175px|Yost brought halfback [[Willie Heston]] with him from California in 1901.]]
The 1901 season was the first in which the Michigan football team won a [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|national championship]]. The team finished the season undefeated, untied, and unscored upon, having prevailed in all eleven of their games by a combined score of 550 to 0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1901 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1901fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1901 squad was the first of five consecutive high-scoring teams that came to be known as Coach Yost's &quot;Point-a-Minute&quot; teams.&lt;ref name=AD&gt;{{cite book|author=Allison Danzig|title=The History of American Football|year=1956|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|chapter=10: An Era of Yost, Stagg, and Thorpe|page=153=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1901 to 1905, Yost's teams compiled a record of 55&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;1 and outscored their opponents by a combined score of 2,821 to 42.&lt;ref name=AD/&gt;

At the end of the 1901 season, team captain [[Hugh White (American football)|Hugh White]] wrote: &quot;The fall of 1901 will go down in the history of Michigan athletics, not only as the most successful football season the University has ever had, but also as establishing the most wonderful and unique record in the history of the game.&quot;&lt;ref name=HW/&gt; A summary of the accomplishments of the 1901 Michigan team was published in the 1902 University of Michigan yearbook under the title &quot;Yost's Soliloquy.&quot;&lt;ref name=YS&gt;{{cite book|title=Yost's Soliloquy|publisher=Michiganensian 1902|year=1902|page=132|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=aag4364.1902.001;q1=ebin;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=138;page=root;view=image}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accomplishments of the 1901 team included the following:
* Highest number of points ever scored in a single season by a recognized team.
* Ten men, all but the [[Center (American football)|center]], carried the ball in turns.
* Speed of play. Michigan ran 219 plays in the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] game, compared to 149 run by [[Harvard Crimson football|Harvard]] in the [[HarvardâYale football rivalry|HarvardâYale game]] of 1901. The fast pace of Michigan's play on offense earned Yost the nickname &quot;Hurry Up.&quot; Yost described the 1901 team as a speedy group &quot;composed of muscular, wiry men who had no superfluous weight.&quot;&lt;ref name=Summary/&gt;
* Punting. The punting of [[Everett Sweeley]] was an important element in Michigan's success in 1901. Sweeley was regarded as &quot;the best punter in the country.&quot;&lt;ref name=YS/&gt;
* The strength of Michigan's line on defense. Michigan's fullback was called upon to make a tackle only once in the entire season. In the final three games of the season, Michigan's defense allowed only seven first downs. Four of Michigan's opponents ([[Albion College|Albion]], [[Case Western Reserve University|Case]], [[Beloit Buccaneers|Beloit]], and [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]]) never had possession of the ball in Michigan's territory. Only [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and [[Buffalo Bulls football|Buffalo]] moved the ball inside Michigan's 30-yard line, and those two instances came on penalties against Michigan for forward passes.
* Lack of injuries. Only one player was taken out of a game for injury, and he returned to practice the Monday after the Saturday game.&lt;ref name=YS/&gt;  The injury was to [[Curtis Redden]] during the [[Carlisle Indians football|Carlisle]] game, and, according to Yost, Redden &quot;was ready and anxious to play ten minutes after the injury.&quot;&lt;ref name=Summary/&gt;

===Whitmore Lake===
[[File:Hugh White.jpg|thumb|right|175px|1901 team captain [[Hugh White (American football)|Hugh White]]]]
Fielding Yost was hired as the new coach at Michigan in the spring of 1901. He traveled to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] in the spring to evaluate the talent pool with which he would be working. After sizing up the players, Yost asked for early practice in the fall. On September 9, 1901, Yost and 1901 team captain [[Hugh White (American football)|Hugh White]] gathered a small squad of men at [[Whitmore Lake, Michigan|Whitmore Lake]]; the squad grew over the next two weeks to nearly 20 players.&lt;ref name=WL&gt;{{cite news|title=Athletics|publisher=Michigan Alumnus|date=October 1901|page=23|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jywJ4ZrxYE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training continued for nearly two weeks, and &quot;cold baths in the lake soon toughened the men.&quot;&lt;ref name=WL/&gt; Yost worked with the players on the rudiments of the game and later recalled that, by the time they returned to Ann Arbor, &quot;we had worked the men down into fairly good training for football work.&quot;&lt;ref name=Summary&gt;{{cite book|author=Jesse J. Ricks|title=Michigan Daily-News Football Year-Book|chapter=Introductory Review|year=1901|publisher=Ann Arbor Printing Company|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VwHiAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to training, Yost spent time at Whitmore Lake evaluating his talent to fit particular positions. He soon shifted players around. He moved the team's only [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]], [[Neil Snow]], from [[End (American football)|end]] to [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] on offense, keeping him at [[Defensive end|right end]] on defense. Yost moved [[Arthur Redner]] from center to [[Guard (American football)|right guard]] and [[George W. Gregory]] to center.&lt;ref name=AD2&gt;Allison Danzig, ''The History of American Football'', p. 154 (quoting a May 13, 1942 letter from Willie Heston to the author).&lt;/ref&gt;  He also brought [[Willie Heston]] with him from [[California]] at the [[Halfback (American football)|halfback]] position. In a 1952 letter, Heston later recalled: &quot;He brought to Michigan an entirely new brand of football, not known in the Big Ten nor to the Middle West. Particularly, that was true of his offense. Speed and more speed was continually emphasized. [[Boss Weeks]] was instructed to call his signal for the next play while the team was getting up from the last play.&quot;&lt;ref name=AD2/&gt;

Team captain White recalled the time at Whitmore Lake as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The work at the Lake was a review in the first principles of the game, a thorough study and quiz upon the rules &amp;ndash; something which had been sadly neglected in former years. It was also the first step in the conditioning of the team.&lt;ref name=HW&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh White|title=Review of the Season|publisher=Michiganensian 1902|year=1902|page=130|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=aag4364.1902.001;q1=ebin;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A new freshman, David Banks, wrote a letter to his mother about his experience in trying out for the football team in the fall of 1901:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I am not sure whether I ought to play football or not. ... I put on Tom's suit one night and went down to the field to meet Yost and a few other men. They made me run around the track a couple times to try my wind. Then they rolled me around the ground and sat on me a while. I did not understand the necessity of all they did to me, but the boys say every great player must begin that way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Letters of David Banks '05|publisher=The Wolverine|date=1901-10-18|page=8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sSfnAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Michigan 55, Albion 0===
[[File:Herb Graver.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Herb Graver]] played at four positions for Yost and still holds the record for most touchdowns in a Michigan-Ohio State game.]]
Michigan opened the 1901 season with a 55â0 win against [[Albion College]]. The game was played in 20-minute halves at [[Regents Field]] in Ann Arbor on September 28. Willie Heston appeared in his first game for the Wolverines as a substitute for Shaw at left halfback. In its account of the game, the ''Michigan Alumnus'' described Heston as a &quot;stocky Californian&quot; who &quot;proved a whirlwind in bucking the line.&quot;&lt;ref name=Albion&gt;{{cite news|title=The Albion Game|publisher=Michigan Alumnus|date=October 1901|page=24|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jywJ4ZrxYE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heston's first touchdown as a Wolverine came on a defensive take-away described as follows: &quot;Once when Albion had the ball on her 25-yard line, Heston broke through between guard and center, got possession of the ball before it left the quarter back's hands, and made a touchdown.&quot;&lt;ref name=Albion/&gt;

The Bentley Historical Library lists the game score as 55-0.  The ''Michigan Alumnus'' in October 1901 reflected a game score of 50-0. The box score published in the same issue of the ''Michigan Alumnus'' reflects the scoring of seven touchdowns and five goals after touchdown, which would result in a point total of 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michigan 57, Case 0===
[[File:Walter W. Shaw.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Walter W. Shaw]] was the starting halfback for the first two games in 1901.]]
On October 5, Michigan played its second game of the season against [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Scientific School]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In a short game of 20-minute halves, Michigan won by a score of 57â0. Heston scored four touchdowns in the game, and he and Sweeley were singled out for praise in the account of the game published in the ''Michigan Alumnus'':&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Two men, Sweeley and Heston, constantly won the plaudits of the rooters by their long gains around the ends. Sweeley is fleet, and he kept his feet in a way that reminded the wise ones of McLean's remarkable performances. Heston proved himself the ground gainer that he has given evidence of being during the daily practices.&quot;&lt;ref name=Case&gt;{{cite news|title=The Case Game|publisher=Michigan Alumnus|date=October 1901|pages=24â25|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jywJ4ZrxYE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In its coverage of the game, the ''Alumnus'' also noted that Michigan's new coach Yost &quot;refuses to have a man on the field who [is] 'yellow' or who is not willing to work and to take his fair share of knocks.&quot;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt; The ''Alumnus'' concluded: &quot;If Michigan has a winning team, it will be because some of the enthusiasm of her coach has been transferred to the men.&quot;&lt;ref name=Case/&gt;

Following the win over Indiana, the student newspaper, ''The Wolverine'' noted: &quot;The 'Varsity showing was most satisfactory. Against a heavier team, on a slippery field which was all in favor of the visitors and directly opposed to our style of play, the 'Varsity was not found wanting and turned victory into a fight for big scores. Even the most optimistic did not look for such a large score, with the elements against us. The smiling, yet earnest face of Coach Yost has become a favorite feature at the games. His success as a coach has already been demonstrated, and every Michigan man is proud of him as an athlete, as a coach and as a man.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Walter T.

On October 26, Michigan defeated the [[Buffalo Bulls football|University of Buffalo]] by a score of 128â0 at Ann Arbor. Albert Herrnstein led the scoring with six touchdowns, and additional touchdowns were added by Neil Snow (4 touchdowns), Willie Heston (3), Arthur Redner (3), Curtis Redden (2) and Bruce Shorts (1).&lt;ref name=Buff/&gt; Shorts was also successful on 18 of 22 extra point kicks in the game.&lt;ref name=MD/&gt; A newspaper account reported that &quot;the most spectacular&quot; play of the game came on a 90-yard touchdown run by Herrnstein.&lt;ref name=Buff2/&gt; The victory was so dominant that the Buffalo team quit fifteen minutes before the game should have ended.&lt;ref name=WHE/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the Wolverines' margin of victory was the third largest in the history of the sport:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[T]he score of to-day's game was one of the most remarkable ever made in the history of football in the important colleges. Only two scores are recorded in American where a victory was won in more decided style. These occasions were when Stevens Institute beat the College of the City of New York by 162 to 0 at Hoboken, N.J., in 1885, and when Harvard beat Exeter by 158 to 0 at Exeter, Mass., in 1886.&quot;&lt;ref name=Buff/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the game, Buffalo's Coach Brown said Michigan was &quot;one of the most wonderful teams he ever saw,&quot;&lt;ref name=Buff2&gt;{{cite news|title=Gridiron Gossip|newspaper=The Daily Review (Decatur, IL)|date=1901-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and added, &quot;Michigan can defeat any team in the East.&quot;&lt;ref name=Buff&gt;{{cite news|title=MICHIGAN MADE HUGE SCORE; Buffalo Football Team, Conquerors of Columbia, Shut Out by Score of 128 to 0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1901-10-27|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9505E2D91130E132A25754C2A9669D946097D6CF | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buffalo had defeated the team from [[Columbia University]], one of the stronger teams in the east, by a score of 5&amp;ndash;0 earlier in the season.

Several newspapers used the Buffalo game as a point of reference in assessing the strength of Michigan's 1901 team. ''The Pittsburgh Press'' reported that Michigan's big victory over a &quot;fairly strong&quot; Buffalo team &quot;shows that Michigan has a remarkable team.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coach Yost Known Here: Handler of Michigan's Great Team Lives at Morgantown|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=1901-10-29|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NhMbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jkgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1880,1305231&amp;dq=michigan+football&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Review'' from [[Decatur, Illinois]] observed: &quot;Considering the fact that Buffalo trimmed Columbia rather easily, making a larger score against the college than did Harvard or Yale, there seems some justice in&quot; Coach Brown's comments that Michigan could defeat Harvard, Yale or Princeton.&lt;ref name=Buff2/&gt; The ''Adrian Daily Telegram'' opined: &quot;Michigan defeated Buffalo 128 to 0, which clearly demonstrates that she can bump the big eastern four without much fear of disaster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football|newspaper=Adrian Daily Telegram|date=1901-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, Coach Yost shared his recollections of the Buffalo game with [[Big Bill Edwards]]: &quot;Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man and had not been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score.&quot;&lt;ref name=WHE&gt;{{cite book|author=William Hanford Edwards|title=Football Days: Memories of the Game and of the Men behind the Ball|page=292|year=1916|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18048}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The score at the end of the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, &quot;on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket.&quot;&lt;ref name=WHE/&gt; Yost was curious and asked, &quot;Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side.&quot;  To which, Simpson replied, &quot;Don't say anything. I know where I am at. The coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine.&quot;&lt;ref name=WHE/&gt;

The Wolverines defeated the [[Carlisle Indians football|Carlisle Indian School]], 22â0, in a game played at [[Bennett Park (Detroit)|Bennett Park]] in [[Detroit]] on November 2. The game was watched by a crowd of 8,000 spectators that included China's Minister to the United States, Wu Ting-Fan, occupying a box with former [[United States Secretary of War]], [[Russell A. Alger]]. Michigan's 22 points came on three touchdowns (worth five points each), a field goal from Bruce Shorts (worth five points) and two extra points kicked by Shorts. At the end of the game, former Secretary of War Alger addressed the crowd and congratulated the Wolverines on their victory.&lt;ref name=Carlisle&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan 22, Carlisle 0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1901-11-03|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E03EFD7143FE433A25750C0A9679D946097D6CF | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' pointed to the Carlisle game as evidence that Michigan's remarkable season was not limited to small institutions. Harvard and [[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell]] beat Carlisle in 1901 by scores of 29â0 and 17â0, and Penn narrowly beat Carlisle by a score of 16â14. Coach Yost later wrote that he believed Michigan would have won by an even larger score if Curtis Redden had not been injured.&lt;ref name=Summary/&gt; Michigan's convincing win over Carlisle, and its wins over Buffalo and Chicago, led the ''Times'' to conclude that a game between Michigan and one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; teams of the East &quot;would be a conflict well worth seeing and productive of interesting and possibly startling results.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite news|title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAMES; Records of the Principal Contests Played This Season.

On November 16, Michigan faced its traditional rival in [[Amos Alonzo Stagg]]'s [[University of Chicago]] [[Chicago Maroons football|Maroons football]] team.

The Chicago team was not to the same extent handicapped by reason of the fact that it did not rely upon speed to advance the ball. ...

===Accolades===

At the conclusion of the 1901 season, team captain Hugh White gave head coach Fielding Yost and trainer [[Keene Fitzpatrick]] substantial credit for the performance of the 1901 team. He credited the coach with &quot;inoculating into the men some of Mr. Yost's own spirit, impulsiveness and optimism,&quot; and with having the &quot;faculty of adapting his plays to the material at hand so that he got the best there was out of every one of the eleven men.&quot;&lt;ref name=H2&gt;Hugh White, ''Review of the Season'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the trainer, White noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;An equally strong element, and one many are apt to overlook, was the work of Keene Fitzpatrick. Consider a team training nearly four months, without a man going stale, and but one injured so that he had to be taken out of the game! Then in addition a trip of nearly 3000 miles, from a climate where the thermometer registered 10 degrees below zero, into one of summer weather, and eleven men playing through an entire game and finishing it with faster and stronger play than at the beginning! Such were the results achieved by our trainer. ... Too much praise cannot be given him.&quot;&lt;ref name=H2/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For its impressive average of 50 points per game on offense and eleven games of scoreless defense, the 1901 team has been recognized as one of the greatest college football teams of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 50 Most Bad Ass College Football Teams|publisher=complex.com|url=http://best.complex.com/lists/The-50-Most-Badass-College-Football-Teams/1901-university-of-michigan}}(ranking the 1901 Wolverines as the #5 team in college football history)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greatest College Football Team of All-Time (Season)|publisher=Rankopedia|url=http://www.rankopedia.com/ZID=3/53/Greatest-College-Football-Team-of-All-Time-(Season)/Step1/5571.htm}} (ranking the 1901 Wolverines #14)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best College Football Teams|publisher=The Top Tens|url=http://www.the-top-tens.com/lists/best-college-football-teams.asp}} (ranking the 1901 Wolverines #25)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Schoenfeld|title=Connecticut women join list of perfect teams|publisher=espn.com|date=2009-04-14}} (picking 1901 Wolverines as 28th greatest perfect season across all sports)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Readers: Best college football team|publisher=espn.com|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/bestCollegefb.html}} (1901 Wolverines among top 19 teams of all-time in votes by espn readers)&lt;/ref&gt;
