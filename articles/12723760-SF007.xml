'''OpenWrt''' is a [[Linux distribution]] primarily targeted at [[router (computing)|routing]] on [[embedded system|embedded devices]]. It comprises a set of about 2000 [[software package (installation)|software packages]], installed and uninstalled via the [[opkg]] package management system. OpenWrt can be configured using the command-line interface of [[BusyBox]] [[Almquist shell|ash]], or the web interface [[LuCI (webinterface)|LuCI]].

OpenWrt can be run on [[Customer-premises equipment|CPE]] routers, [[residential gateway]]s, [[smartphone]]s (e.g. [[Neo FreeRunner]]), [[pocket computer]]s (e.g. [[Ben NanoNote]]), and small [[laptop]]s (e.g. [[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC). But it is also possible to run on ordinary computers (e.g. [[x86]]).

The project incorporates a [[wiki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.openwrt.org/ |title=OpenWrt Wiki |publisher=wiki.openwrt.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Internet forum|forum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://forum.openwrt.org/ |title=OpenWrt forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Apache Subversion|SVN]] source version control&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dev.openwrt.org/ |title=OpenWrt development center}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trac]] for project management, bug-tracking, and code development. Additional technical support is also provided via [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC).

== Features ==
The features include:

* A writable [[root directory|root file system]], enabling users to add, remove or modify any file. This is accomplished by using [http://lwn.net/Articles/135283/ mini_fo] to overlay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/techref/flash.layout#partitioning.of.squashfs-images |title=OpenWrt partition layout}} &lt;/ref&gt; a read-only compressed [[SquashFS]] file system with a writable [[JFFS2]] file system in a [[copy-on-write]] fashion.
* Flash [[wear leveling]] using JFFS2.
* The package manager ''opkg'', similar to [[dpkg]] or [[Pacman (package manager)|pacman]], allowing users to install and remove software. This contrasts with Linux-based firmwares based on a read-only file systems that offers efficient compression but no way to modify the installed software without rebuilding and flashing a complete firmware image.
* A package repository containing about 2,000 packages, chiefly ones suited for an environment with limited resources.
* ''Sysupgrade'', preserving selected configuration files on firmware upgrade.
* a set of scripts called UCI (unified configuration interface) intended to unify and simplify the configuration of the entire system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci |title=OpenWrt Unified Configuration Interface}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* extensible configuration of your network involving [[VLAN]] with exhaustive possibilities to configure the [[routing]] itself
* customizable methods to filter, manipulate, delay and rearrange network packets:
** [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]]
** [[Port Forwarding]] of external traffic to computers behind [[Network address translation|NAT]] inside the [[Local area network|LAN]]
** [[Quality of Service]] for simultaneous use of applications such as [[VoIP]], [[online game|online gaming]], and [[streaming media]]
** [[Traffic shaping]] to ensure fair distribution of bandwidth among users
** Load balancing for use with multiple ISPs
** IP tunneling
** Realtime [[network monitoring]] and statistics
* Static [[DHCP]] leases
* [[UPnP]] and [[NAT-PMP]] for dynamically configured port forwarding
* Use of [[Dynamic DNS]] services to maintain a fixed domain name with an [[Internet service provider|ISP]] that does not provide a static [[IP address]]
* On devices with [[USB]] ports only:
**[[Wireless modem|3G modem support]]
** [[print server|Printer sharing]]
** Windows-compatible [[file sharing]] (via [[SAMBA]])
** File sharing via [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] and [[FTP]]
** Audio/Video streaming via [[DLNA]]/[[UPnP]] AV
** [[iTunes]] ([[Digital Audio Access Protocol|DAAP]]) server
** [[Webcam]] streaming
** USB audio
* An extensive [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]-enabled [[web interface]], thanks to the LuCI project&lt;ref name=&quot;LuCI&quot; /&gt;
* Configuration of the device as a [[wireless repeater]], [[wireless access point]], [[wireless bridge]], or a combination of these
* [[Mesh network]]ing
* User-configurable hardware buttons
* Regular [[bug fix]]es and updates, even for devices no longer supported by their manufacturers

=== Web interface ===
[[File:Openwrt-luci-firewall.png|thumb|A screenshot of the LuCI web interface used by version 10.03.1-RC5 of OpenWrt.  Here it is being used to configure the firewall.]]
Before release 8.09, OpenWrt had a minimal web interface. In release 8.09 a new, more capable web interface is included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://downloads.openwrt.org/kamikaze/8.09/release.txt OpenWrt 8.09 release notes]  ''OpenWrt download page for 8.09.'.' Retrieved February 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This interface is based on LuCI, an [[Modelâviewâcontroller|MVC]] framework written in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LuCI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://luci.subsignal.org/ |title=LuCI project |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[X-Wrt]] project provides an alternate web interface, webifÂ², for current and previous version of OpenWrt.  It has more than 40 control and status pages.

== History ==
The project came into being after Linksys built the [[firmware]] for their [[Linksys WRT54G series|WRT54G]] wireless router from publicly-available code licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. Under the terms of that license, they were required to make the source code of their modified version available under the same license, enabling independent developers to create additional derivative versions.  Support was originally limited to the WRT54G series, but has since been expanded to include many other chipsets, manufacturers and device types, including [[Plug Computer]]s and [[Openmoko]] mobile phones.

Using this code as a base and later as a reference, developers created a distribution that offers many features not previously found in consumer-level routers. Some features formerly required proprietary software. Before the introduction of OpenWrt 8.09, using Linux 2.6.25, and the ''b43'' kernel module, WLAN for many [[Broadcom]]-based routers was only available through the proprietary wl.o module that was also only provided for Linux 2.4.

=== Sveasoft controversy ===
On 2006-03-11, the OpenWrt developers publicly announced that [[Sveasoft]] had violated its GPL license terms, and that Sveasoft's continuing distribution of OpenWrt was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openwrt.org/?p=27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060619234857/http://openwrt.org/?p=27 |archivedate=2006-06-19|title=Notice of License Termination |publisher=OpenWrt |date=March 11, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Sveasoft claimed that OpenWrt was illegally redistributing software copyrighted by Sveasoft and [[Broadcom]] and placing them under the GPL without being authorized to do so by the copyright holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=22625#p22625|title=sveasoft post to forum.openwrt.org|date=12 March 2006|accessdate=2007-08-07|publisher=OpenWrt}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each group denies the other's allegations.

== Naming ==
Several major versions of OpenWrt were named after [[alcoholic beverage]]s, usually including their recipes in the SSH login screen as well.

* 0.9: [[White Russian (cocktail)|White Russian]] - ''legacy'' - 2007 January
* 7.06: [[Kamikaze (cocktail)|Kamikaze]] - 2007 June
* 7.07: Kamikaze - 2007 July
* 7.09: Kamikaze - 2007 September
* 8.09: Kamikaze - 2008 September
* 8.09.1: Kamikaze - 2009 June
* 8.09.2: Kamikaze - 2010 January
* 10.03: [[Backfire (cocktail)|Backfire]] - '''current stable''' - 2010 April
* 10.03.1: Backfire '''next stable''' - not released&lt;ref&gt;https://dev.openwrt.org/milestone/Backfire%2010.03.1&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bleeding edge: [[Attitude Adjustment (cocktail)|Attitude Adjustment]] - ''development''

The bleeding edge development [http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/latest trunk] was confusingly also called [http://wiki.openwrt.org/about/history Kamikaze] until February 2011 but with r25514 it was renamed as &quot;Attitude Adjustment&quot;.

It was originally available as a set of packages for OpenWrt. As the author of Gargoyle started to make modifications to the base system layout of OpenWrt, the package system was dropped and the only currently available downloads are full firmware images. Gargoyle makes extensive use of JavaScript, to offload as much work as possible to the client computer, and is focused on ease of use, striving to reach a level comparable to the appliance feel of commercial router firmware.
