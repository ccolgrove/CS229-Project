It is used in a feature called '''one-click install'''. This allows a user to click a &quot;One-Click Install&quot; button on certain websites to automatically install software, without having to download and install the software separately. The YMP file will open the one-click install manager which is managed by [[YaST]]. The system will automatically add the [[Software repository|repository]] containing the application, and then download and install the program.
