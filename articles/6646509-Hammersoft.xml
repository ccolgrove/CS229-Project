'''JÃ©rÃ©my Berthod''' (born 24 April 1984 in [[Tassin-la-Demi-Lune]], [[RhÃ´ne (department)|RhÃ´ne]]) is a [[France|French]] [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[AJ Auxerre]] as a [[Defender (association football)#Full back|left defender]].

==Football career==
A product of the [[Olympique Lyonnais Reserves and Academy|Olympique Lyonnais youth academy]], Berthod made his [[Olympique Lyonnais|first team]] debut on 13 September 2003, in a 1&amp;ndash;1 home draw against [[AJ Auxerre]]. He would go on to play a somewhat important part in the team's four consecutive [[Ligue 1]] titles (with the player's presence), and was also a regular selection for the [[France national under-21 football team|France U-21 squad]] during that timeframe.

In July 2007, l'OL agreed to transfer Berthod to [[AS Monaco FC]], for a fee of [[Euro|â¬]]2m.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=559297.html Berthod keen to start anew at Monaco]; UEFA.com, 6 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He made his Monaco debut in [[2007&amp;ndash;08 Ligue 1|the season]]'s second round, a 1&amp;ndash;2 defeat at [[FC Lorient]], picking up a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] in the process, and finished the season with 12 league contests played.

After an unimpressive season at Monaco, Berthod made a summer move to Auxerre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=546723&amp;&amp;cc=5901 Berthod (Monaco) Ã  Auxerre (Berthod (Monaco) to Auxerre)]; [[ESPN Soccernet]], 14 June 2008 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Berthod's younger brother, [[Alexandre Berthod|Alexandre]], was also a footballer (and a defender), and also briefly represented Lyon.
