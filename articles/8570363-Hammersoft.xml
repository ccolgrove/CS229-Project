'''[[Sailing|Sailing/Yachting]]''' is a [[Olympic sport]] starting from the Games of the 1st [[Olympiad]] ([[Sailing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] in Athens {{GRE}}). With the exception of [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] and possible [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916]] sailing was always a part of the Olympic program.
The Sailing program of 1972 consisted of a total of six sailing classes (disciplines). For each class seven races were scheduled from 29 August 1972 to 8 September 1972 of the coast of Kiel-Schilksee in the [[Firth of Kiel]]. Kiel hosted the Olympic sailing competitions for the second time, having previously done so duyring the [[Sailing at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Olympics]].
The sailing was done on the triangular type Olympic courses.

According to the IOC statutes the contests in all sport disciplines must be held either in, or as close as possible to the city which the IOC has chosen. Among others, an exception is made for the Olympic
yachting events, which customarily must be staged on the open sea. On account of this principle, immediately after it became known that the city of Munich had the intention of hosting [[1972 Summer Olympics|the Games of the XXth Olympiad]], the cities of [[Kiel]] and [[LÃ¼beck]] competed for the honor to carry out the Olympic yachting regattas.
When Kiel (and the Kieler Yacht Club) won the competition the following was decided:
* a yachting center would be built in Kiel/Schilksee that, as was the case with the sport facilities in Munich, must be usable after the period of the Olympic Games as a future sports center;
* the city of Kiel will conduct a building competition for the Olympic Center in Kiel-Schilksee as soon as possible;
* the OC will form a committee for the Olympic yachting events to coordinate all contingencies arising in Kiel, and will in addition create a corresponding fulltime organization of the OC in Kiel in order to handle the necessary work and activities in Kiel on schedule.
During the Games the number of spectators and visitors at the Olympic events in Kiel and at the Olympic Center in Kiel-Schilksee exceeded the expectations by a large margin. Conservative estimates put the total number at about a million spectators and visitors in Kiel.

A total of three race areas were created in the Firth of Kiel of the coast of Kiel/Schilksee.

== Remarks ==
=== Munich ===
Because of the distance to [[Munich]] and the fact that no sailing was scheduled for 6 and 7 September, the killings of 11 Israeli athletes had less impact on sailing than it had on the other events in Munich. Only a few of the sailing teams did not start at the last day of the races. Among them the Israelian Flying&amp;nbsp;Dutchman team of: Yair Michaeli and Izchak Nir.

=== Sailing ===
* This Olympic sailing event was gender independent, but tuned out to be a ''Mens only'' event. This was one of the triggers to create gender specific events. This however had to wait until [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]].
* Some sources state the Finn event as a designated '''men only''' event. The Official report of the games does not mention this gender specific discriminator,
* It was the first Olympic sailing contest were '''only''' &quot;One Design&quot; classes were used. Also non of the classes was &quot;owned by one builder&quot;. In general more than one builder was allowed. (The boats had to apply to what we now call open standards).
* [[Paul ElvstrÃ¸m]] was trying to win his fifth Gold medal. He left the games however premature. Assumed is that the media pressure became too high at that moment. Paul took revenge by sailing two times more at the Olympics (1984 and 1988) in the [[Tornado (sailboat)|Tornado]]. One of Paul's crewmembers from the Soling took the gold later. [[Valdemar Bandolowski]] together with 1972 Dragon helmsman [[Poul Richard HÃ¸j Jensen]] won the Gold in the Soling class in 1976 and 1980.
* Although favourable wind conditions in September were predicted. Some of the races suffered from lack of wind. In the Soling and Dragon only 6 races could be completed and the 6th race in the Finn only three contenders were able to finish in time.

=== Sailors ===
During the Sailing regatta's at the 1972 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:
