The '''Xbox''' is a [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth-generation]] [[video game console]] manufactured by [[Microsoft]]. It was released on November 15, 2001 in North America, February 22, 2002 in Japan, and March 14, 2002 in Australia and Europe and is the predecessor to the [[Xbox 360]]. It was Microsoft's first foray into the gaming console market, and competed with [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]], [[Sega]]'s [[Dreamcast]], and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]].  The integrated [[Xbox Live]] service allowed players to [[online game|play games online]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gamerscoreblog1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Press/archive/2010/0205-whittenletter |title=Xbox Press : A Letter from Marc Whitten: Discontinuation of Xbox LIVE for Original Xbox Games |publisher=Xbox.com |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox was discontinued in late 2006, although the final Xbox game, ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' was released in August 2008. Support for out-of-warranty Xbox consoles was discontinued on March 2, 2009; any in-warranty repair now needed will not be undertaken and faulty consoles will be replaced with an Xbox 360 instead. Xbox Live support was discontinued on April 15, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamerscoreblog1&quot;/&gt;

==History==
In 1998 four engineers from [[Microsoft]]âs [[DirectX]] team, Kevin Bachus, Seamus Blackley, Ted Hase and DirectX team leader Otto Berkes, disassembled some [[Dell]] laptop computers to construct a [[prototype]] [[Microsoft Windows]]-based [[video game console]]. The team hoped to create a console to compete with the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]], which was luring game developers away from the Windows [[computing platform|platform]]. The team approached [[Ed Fries]], the leader of Microsoftâs game publishing business at the time, and pitched their âDirectX Boxâ console based on the DirectX graphics technology developed by Berkesâ team. Fries decided to support the teamâs idea of creating a Windows DirectX based console.&lt;ref name=seattletimes_20110525&gt;{{cite news |title=Last of Xbox Dream Team, Otto Berkes Is Moving On |first=Brier |last=Dudley |date=2011-05-25 |newspaper=The Seattle Time |publisher=Seattle Times Co |page=A12 |accessdate=2011-05-25 |quote= Berkes and Hase were among a group of four who first pushed Microsoft to develop a Windows-based gaming system to compete with Sony's PlayStation 2, which was luring game companies from the Windows platform in the late 1990s. The other two were Seamus Blackley, who left in 2002, and Kevin Bachus, who left in 2001.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seattletimes_20110524&gt;{{cite news |title= Exclusive: Microsoft loses last Xbox founder, mobile PC visionary |first=Brier |last=Dudley |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/technologybrierdudleysblog/2015137144_its_the_end_of_an.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times |publisher=Seattle Times Co |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2011-05-25 |quote= In 1998, Berkes and his team ordered a few Dell laptops, took them apart and built the first prototypes of a Windows gaming console.

During development, the original DirectX box name was shortened to Xbox. Microsoftâs marketing department did not like the Xbox name, and suggested many alternatives. During focus testing, the Xbox name was left on the list of possible names to demonstrate how unpopular the Xbox name would be with consumers. However, consumer testing revealed that Xbox was preferred by far over the other suggested names and âXboxâ became the official name of the product.&lt;ref name=gamasutra_2009-08-14&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=24831 |title=Interview: Former Microsoft Exec Fries Talks Xbox's Genesis |first=Leigh |last=Alexander |date=2009-08-14 |work=Gamasutra |publisher=UBM TechWeb |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yxGkLXlW |archivedate=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2011-05-25 |quote=Direct X-Box, of course, was truncated to 'Xbox,' -- and &quot;marketing hated the name,&quot; says Fries. &quot;They went off and created this whole, long list of better names for the machine.&quot;In focus testing, the marketing team left the name 'Xbox' on that long list simply as a control, to demonstrate to everyone why it was a horrible name for a console. &quot;Of course, 'Xbox' outscored, in focus testing, everything they came up with. They had to admit it was going to be the Xbox.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox was [[Microsoft]]'s first video game console after collaborating with [[Sega]] to port [[Microsoft Windows CE|Windows CE]] to the [[Dreamcast]] console. Microsoft repeatedly delayed the console, which was first mentioned publicly in late 1999 during interviews with then-Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. Gates stated that a gaming/multimedia device was essential for multimedia convergence in the new times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2000/03-10Xbox.mspx |title=Xbox Brings &quot;Future-Generation&quot; Games to Life |publisher=Microsoft |date=March 10, 2000 |accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Bill Gates unveiled the Xbox at the Game Developers Conference in 2000, audiences were impressed by the console's technology. At the time of Gates' announcement, Sega's Dreamcast sales were diminishing and Sony's PlayStation 2 was just going on sale in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;xboxtimeline1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven L. |last=Kent |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/january04/Xboxtimeline/ |title=Xbox Timeline |publisher=GameSpy.com |date=2004-02-16 |accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concentrating on making a big splash in Japan, Microsoft delayed its European launch, though Europe later proved to be the more receptive market.&lt;ref name=&quot;xboxtimeline1&quot;/&gt;

Some of Microsoft's plans proved effective. In preparation for its launch, Microsoft acquired Bungie and used ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' as its launch title. At the time, ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' for Nintendo 64 had been one of the few hit [[First-person shooter|FPS]] games to appear on a console, some of other  ones being Perfect Dark and Medal of Honor. ''Halo: Combat Evolved'' proved a good application to drive the Xbox's sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;xboxtimeline1&quot;/&gt; In 2002, Microsoft made the second place slot in consoles sold in North America.

Popular [[launch game]]s for the console included ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'', ''[[Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding]]'', ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', ''[[Fuzion Frenzy]]'', ''[[Project Gotham Racing]]'' and ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]''.

===Discontinuation and successor===
{{expand section|date=September 2011}}
{{Main|Xbox 360|List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360}}
The Xbox's successor, the Xbox 360, was officially unveiled announced on May 12, 2005 on [[MTV]] and released in North America on November 22, 2005. [[Nvidia]] ceased production of the Xbox's GPU in August 2005, which marked the end of Xbox production.

When equipped with a removable hard drive add-on, the Xbox 360 supports [[List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360|a limited number of the Xbox's game library]] through emulation. As the architectures of the Xbox and Xbox 360 are different, software emulation is the only way to enable compatibility without including hardware from the original Xbox. Emulation adds support for [[anti-aliasing]] as well as upscaling of the still standard definition image. These emulators are periodically updated to add compatibility for older games and are available free through Xbox Live or as a file download to be burned to a DVD-R from the Xbox web site. These updates are also available monthly as part of the demo disc that comes with each issue of [[Official Xbox Magazine]].

==Hardware and accessories==

===Hardware===

The Xbox was the first video game console to feature a built-in [[hard disk drive]], used primarily for storing game saves and content downloaded from Xbox Live. This eliminated the need for separate [[memory card]]s (although some older consoles, such as the [[TurboGrafx-CD]], [[Mega-CD|Sega CD]] and [[Sega Saturn]] had featured built-in battery backup memory prior to 2001). An Xbox user could [[Ripping|rip]] music from [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|standard audio CDs]] to the hard drive, and these songs were used for the custom soundtracks in some games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/909942 |title = Xbox: Description of custom soundtracks |accessdate = 2008-01-13 |date = 2007-04-25 |publisher = Microsoft Knowledge Base}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox was the first gaming product to feature Dolby Interactive Content-Encoding Technology, which allows real-time Dolby Digital encoding in game consoles. Previous game consoles could only use Dolby Digital 5.1 during non-interactive &quot;cut scene&quot; playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/press_releases/841_co.pr.0104.xbox.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060219162524/http://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/press_releases/841_co.pr.0104.xbox.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-19 |title=The Xbox Video Game System from Microsoft to Feature Groundbreaking Dolby Interactive Content-Encoding Technology |date=2001-04-18 |publisher=[[Dolby Laboratories]] |accessdate=2008-07-03 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xbox is based on commodity PC hardware and is much larger and heavier than its contemporaries. This is largely due to a bulky tray-loading [[DVD|DVD-ROM]] drive and the standard-size 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch hard drive. The Xbox has also pioneered safety features, such as breakaway cables for the controllers to prevent the console from being pulled from the surface it rests on.

Several internal hardware revisions have been made in an ongoing battle to discourage [[modding]] (hackers continually updated [[modchip]] designs in an attempt to defeat them), to cut manufacturing costs, and to make the DVD-ROM drive more reliable (some of the early units' drives gave Disc Reading Errors due to the unreliable Thomson DVD-ROM drives used). Later generation units that used the Thomson TGM-600 DVD-ROM drives and the Philips VAD6011 DVD-ROM drives were still vulnerable to failure that rendered the consoles either unable to read newer discs or caused them to halt the console with an error code usually indicating a [[Programmed input/output|PIO]]/[[Direct memory access|DMA]] identification failure, respectively. These units were not covered under the extended warranty.

In 2002 Microsoft and [[Nvidia]] entered arbitration over a dispute on the pricing of Nvidia's chips for the Xbox.&lt;ref name=&quot;eetimes-chip-dispute&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4094562/Microsoft-takes-Nvidia-to-arbitration-over-pricing-of-Xbox-processors|title= Microsoft takes Nvidia to arbitration over pricing of Xbox processors|accessdate=2006-06-29|date=2002-04-29|publisher=[[EE Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nvidia's filing with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] indicated that Microsoft was seeking a US$13 million discount on shipments for NVIDIA's fiscal year 2002. Microsoft alleged violations of the agreement the two companies entered, sought reduced chipset pricing, and sought to ensure that Nvidia fulfill Microsoft's chipset orders without limits on quantity. The matter was privately settled on February 6, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4090108/Microsoft-and-Nvidia-settle-Xbox-chip-pricing-dispute|title=Microsoft and Nvidia settle Xbox chip pricing dispute|accessdate=2006-06-29|date=2003-02-06|publisher=[[EE Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launch-era Xbox gaming units were made in [[Hungary]] and the controllers made mostly in [[Indonesia]].

===Controllers &amp; Accessories===
[[File:Xbox-Duke-Controller.jpg|thumb|left|Original &quot;Fatty&quot;&lt;ref name=nickname/&gt; Xbox controller]]
[[File:Xbox-s-controller.jpg|thumb|right|Xbox controller S]]
The Xbox controller features two [[analog stick]]s, a pressure sensitive directional pad, two analog triggers, a Back button, a Start button, two accessory slots and six 8-bit analog action buttons (A/Green, B/Red, X/Blue, Y/Yellow, and Black and White buttons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://euc.jp/periphs/xbox-controller.en.html |title = Inside Xbox 360 Controller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard Xbox controller (also nicknamed the &quot;Fatty&quot;&lt;ref name=nickname&gt;{{cite web|title=Xbox 360 Wireless Controller Tour |url=http://gear.ign.com/articles/613/613588p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2011-07-02 |date=2005-05-13 |quote=the original &quot;Fatty&quot; Xbox controller didn't have a specific public name}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the &quot;Duke&quot;&lt;ref name=nickname2&gt;{{cite web |title=Xbox's original beast of a controller making a comeback? |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20071383-1/xboxs-original-beast-of-a-controller-making-a-comeback/ |publisher=CNET |accessdate=2011-10-16 |date=2005-06-15 |quote=Anyone who purchased the original Xbox during its launch window quickly came to know its behemoth of a controller, now nicknamed &quot;Duke.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was originally the controller bundled with Xbox systems for all territories except Japan. The controller has been criticized for being bulky compared to other video game controllers; it was awarded &quot;Blunder of the Year&quot; by ''[[Game Informer]]'' in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Games of 2001. ''[[Game Informer]]'' (January 2002, pg. 48).&lt;/ref&gt; a Guinness World Record for the biggest controller in [[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition]] 2008, and was ranked the second worst video game controller ever by [[IGN]] editor [[Craig Harris (journalist)|Craig Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Game Controllers |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/690/690449p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Controller S&quot; (codenamed &quot;Akebono&quot;), a smaller, lighter Xbox controller, was originally the standard Xbox controller only in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Ninja Beach Party. ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' (October 2002, issue 11, pg. 44).&lt;/ref&gt; designed for users with smaller hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christopher Buecheler chrisb@gamespy.com |url=http://archive.gamespy.com/hardware/march02/xboxcontrollers/  |title=GameSpy.com - Hardware: Xbox Controller S |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2010-11-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080624085615/http://archive.gamespy.com/hardware/march02/xboxcontrollers/ |archivedate = 2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamer20.com/features/150/4 |title=Xbox Retrospective: All-Time Top Xbox News |publisher=Gamer 2.0 |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Controller S&quot; was later released in other territories by popular demand and by 2002 replaced the standard controller in the Xbox's retail package, with the larger original controller remaining available as an accessory.

An 8&amp;nbsp;MB removable [[Solid-state drive|solid state]] [[memory card]] can be plugged into the controllers, onto which game saves can either be copied from the hard drive when in the Xbox dashboard's memory manager or saved during a game. Most Xbox game saves can be copied to the memory unit and moved to another console but some Xbox saves are digitally signed; each console has a unique signing key, and some games (e.g. ''[[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball]]'') will not load saved games signed by a different Xbox, limiting the utility of the memory card. Some game saves can be tagged as uncopyable or simply padded to over 8&amp;nbsp;MB (''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''). The signing mechanism has been reverse-engineered by the Xbox hacking community, who have developed tools to modify savegames to work in a different console, though the signing key of the recipient Xbox (the &quot;HDkey&quot;) and the ramped-up title key of the game (the &quot;authkey&quot;) must be known. It is also possible to save an Xbox Live account on a memory unit, to simplify its use on more than one Xbox.

The Xbox includes a standard AV cable which provides [[composite video]] and [[monaural]] or [[stereophonic sound|stereo audio]] to TVs equipped with [[RCA connector|RCA]] inputs. European Xboxes also included an RCA jack to [[SCART]] converter block as well as the standard AV cable.{{clear}}

==Operating system==

The Xbox runs a custom [[operating system]] which was once believed to be a modified version of the [[Windows 2000]] [[kernel (computing)|kernel]]. It exposes [[Application programming interface|API]]s similar to APIs found in [[Microsoft Windows]], such as [[DirectX]] 8.1. The system software may have been based on the [[Windows NT]] architecture that powered [[Windows 2000]]; it is not a modified version of either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/xboxteam/archive/2006/02/17/534421.aspx|title=The Xbox Operating System|work=XBox Team Blog|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[user interface]] for the Xbox is called the Xbox Dashboard. It features a [[media player (application software)|media player]] that can be used to play music CDs, rip CDs to the Xbox's built-in [[hard drive]] and play music that has been ripped to the hard drive; it also let users manage game saves, music, and downloaded content from Xbox LIVE, and lets Xbox LIVE users sign in and manage their account. The dashboard is only available when the user is not watching a movie or playing a game. It uses many shades of green and black for the user interface, to be consistent with the physical Xbox color scheme. When the Xbox was released in 2001 the LIVE service was not online yet, so the dashboard's LIVE  feature was unusable.

Xbox LIVE was released in 2002, but in order to access it users had to buy the Xbox LIVE starter kit containing a [[headset (telephone/computer)|headset]], a subscription, and supplemental. While the Xbox was still being supported by Microsoft, the Xbox Dashboard was updated via Xbox LIVE several times to reduce cheating and add features.

==Xbox Live==
[[File:Xbox-live-logo.png|thumb|right|Xbox Live logo since 2005|150px]]
{{Main|Xbox Live}}
On November 15, 2002, Microsoft launched its Xbox Live online gaming service, allowing subscribers to play online Xbox games with other subscribers around the world and download new content directly to the system's [[hard drive]]. The online service works only with a [[broadband]] Internet connection. Approximately 250,000 subscribers signed up within two months of Xbox Live's launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.ign.com/articles/381/381618p1.html|title= Xbox Live Subscriptions Double Expectations|accessdate=2007-09-30|author=Coleman, Stephen|date=2003-01-07|publisher= IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, Microsoft announced that Xbox Live had reached one million subscribers; in July 2005, membership reached two million, and by July 2007 there were more than 3 million subscribers.

The Xbox launched in North America on November 15, 2001. Its most successful [[launch game]] was ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/472132-halo-combat-evolved/index.html Halo: Combat Evolved] at [[GameRankings]]&lt;/ref&gt; Its sequel, ''[[Halo 2]]'', is the [[List of best-selling video games#Xbox|best-selling Xbox game]] worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;halo2sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Asher Moses | date=2007-08-30 | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/prepare-for-allout-war/2007/08/30/1188067256196.html | title=Prepare for all-out war | publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | accessdate=2008-07-16 | quote=Combined, the first two Halo games have notched up sales of more than 14.5 million copies so far, about 8 million of which can be attributed to Halo 2, which is the best-selling first-generation Xbox game worldwide.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were several more popular second-party launch titles, including ''[[NFL Fever 2002]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/472134-nfl-fever-2002/index.html|title=NFL Fever 2002: Summary|accessdate=2007-09-30|publisher=[[GameRankings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Project Gotham Racing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/472137-project-gotham-racing/index.html|title=Project Gotham Racing: Summary |accessdate=2007-09-30|publisher=[[GameRankings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Dead or Alive 3]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/475251-dead-or-alive-3/index.html|title=Dead or Alive 3: Summary |accessdate = 2007-09-30|publisher=[[GameRankings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the early public reputation of the Xbox was damaged by the failure of ''[[Azurik: Rise of Perathia]]'' and other games designed and marketed by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/xbox/472133-azurik-rise-of-perathia/index.html| title=Azurik: Rise of Perathia: Summary|accessdate=2007-09-30|publisher=[[GameRankings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the console gained strong third party support from its inception, many early Xbox games did not fully use its powerful hardware, with few additional features or graphical improvements to distinguish them from the PS2 version, thus negating one of the Xbox's main selling points. Sony countered the Xbox for a short time by temporarily securing PlayStation 2 exclusives for highly anticipated games such as the [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] and ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''.

In 2002 and 2003, several releases helped the Xbox gain momentum and distinguish itself from the PS2. The [[Xbox Live]] online service was launched in late 2002 alongside pilot titles ''MotoGP'', ''[[MechAssault]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon]]''. Several best-selling and critically praised titles for the Xbox were published, such as ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'', ''[[Ninja Gaiden (2004 video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'' and [[LucasArts]]' ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. [[Take-Two Interactive]]'s exclusivity deal with [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] was amended to allow ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and its [[Grand Theft Auto (series)|sequels]] to be published for the Xbox. Many other publishers got into the trend of releasing the Xbox version alongside the PS2 version, instead of delaying it for months.

In 2004 ''[[Halo 2]]'' became the highest-grossing release in entertainment history, making over $125 million in its first day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/Halo-2-clears-record-125-million-in-first-day/2100-1043_3-5447379.html| title='Halo 2' clears record $125 million in first day|accessdate=2007-09-30|last=Becker|first= David|date=2004-11-10| publisher=News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming Xbox Live's first [[killer application|killer app]]. That year Microsoft made a deal to put [[Electronic Arts]]'s popular titles on [[Xbox Live]].

The last game released on the Xbox was ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'', on August 12, 2008. It was also the only Xbox game released in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

On November 15, 2001, Xbox launched in North America and quickly sold out.

The Xbox has sold 24 million units worldwide as of May 10, 2006, according to Microsoft.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamers_catch&quot; /&gt; This is divided out to 16 million units sold in North America, six million units in Europe, and two million units sold in Asia.

===UK advertising controversy===

In 2002 the [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) banned a television advertisement for the Xbox in the [[United Kingdom]] after complaints that it was highly distasteful, violent, scary and upsetting. It depicted a mother giving birth to a small boy who was fired like a projectile through a hospital window and who aged rapidly as he flew through the air yelling. As he soared across a large area, he passed quickly through stages of his life as though time was passing him by. After aging into an old man, he crash-landed into his own grave. Dust and smoke poured from the grave. The advertisement ended with the slogan ''Life is short. Play more.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2028725.stm|title='Shocking' Xbox advert banned|accessdate=2007-07-18|date=2002-06-06|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modding==
[[File:Xboxinside01.jpg|thumb|left|Xbox motherboard, with installed [[modchip]]]]
The popularity of the Xbox, as well as (in the United States) its comparatively short 90-day warranty, inspired efforts to circumvent the built-in hardware and software security mechanisms, a practice informally known as [[modding]]. Within a few months of its release the initial layer of security on the Xbox BIOS (which relied heavily on [[source code obfuscation|obfuscation]]) was broken by MIT student [[Andrew Huang]] and the contents of the &quot;hidden&quot; boot ROM embedded on the MCPx chip was extracted using some custom built hardware. Once this information was available, the code was soon modified so that it would skip digital signature checks and media flags, allowing unsigned code, Xbox game backups, etc., to be run. This was possible due to flaws in the Xbox's security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/fahrplan/attachments/591-paper_xbox.pdf|title=17 Mistakes Microsoft Made in the Xbox Security System|publisher=[[Chaos Computer Club]]|date=2005|accessdate=2010-08-16|work=Steil, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modding an Xbox in any manner will void its warranty, as it may require disassembly of the console. Having a modified Xbox may also disallow it from accessing Xbox Live, if detected by Microsoft, as it contravenes the Xbox Live [[Terms of Use]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/LiveTOU|title=Xbox Live Terms of Use|accessdate=2007-07-18|date=October 2006|publisher=Xbox.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; But most modchips can be disabled, allowing the Xbox to boot in a &quot;stock&quot; configuration. Softmods can be disabled by &quot;coldbooting&quot; a game (having the game in the DVD drive before turning the console on, so the softmod is not loaded) or by using a multiboot configuration.

There are four main methods of modding the Xbox:

*[[Modchip]]: installing a modchip inside the Xbox that bypasses the original BIOS, with a hacked BIOS to circumvent the security mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faqglossary/a/modchips.htm |title=Modchips - What Are They and Should You Use One?|accessdate=2007-07-18|author=Rybka, Jason|publisher=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thin small-outline package|TSOP]] flashing: reflashing the onboard BIOS chip with a hacked BIOS to circumvent the security mechanisms. The Xbox BIOS is contained on a commodity [[EEPROM]] (the 'TSOP'), which can be made writable by the Xbox by bridging points on the motherboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/37/62/|title=Flashing TSOP With ANY Version XBOX V1.0-V1.5 For Noobs|accessdate=2007-07-18|author=SLuSHIE |date=2004-03-30|publisher=I-Hacked.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flashing is usually carried out by using a specially crafted gamesave (see 'Game save exploit', below) to flash the onboard TSOP, but the TSOP can also be de-soldered and re-written in a standard EEPROM programmer. This method only works on 1.0 to 1.5 Xboxes, as later versions replace the commodity TSOP with an LPC ROM contained within a proprietary chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Xbox_Hardware_Overview#Xcalibur|title=Xbox Hardware Overview â Xcalibur|accessdate=2007-07-18| author=Steil, Michael|date=2007-02-07|publisher=[[Xbox Linux]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Softmod]]s: installing additional software files to the Xbox hard drive, which exploit programming errors in the Dashboard to gain control of the system, and overwrite the in-memory copy of the BIOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox-hq.com/html/modules.php?name=Xbox_Homebrew&amp;op=view&amp;gid=132|title=Phoenix Bios Loader|accessdate=2007-07-18|author=Phoenix| publisher=Xbox-HQ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft modification is known to be safe for Xbox Live if the user enables multibooting with the Microsoft dashboard and an original game disc is used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (''See also'': [[Xbox softmods]])
**Game save exploit: using select official game releases to load game saves that exploit buffer overflows in the save game handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1043-994794.html|title=Hacker cracks Xbox challenge|accessdate=2007-07-18|author=Becker, David|date=2003-03-31|publisher=News.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these special game saves are loaded, they access an interface with scripts for installing the necessary softmod files. Disassembly of the Xbox is not required when installing most game save exploits.
*[[Hot swapping]]: using a computer to change the data on the hard drive. This requires having the Xbox unlock the hard drive when it is turned on, then swapping the powered hard drive into a running computer. By using a Linux-based Live CD, data on the hard drive can be read, altered, and deleted. In most cases, an automated script will automatically install the softmod files directly to the Xbox hard drive. This technique has been used extensively to harbor cheating on many online games. Disassembly of the console is required to perform a hot swap.

===Alternative operating systems===
Beyond gaming, a modded Xbox can be used as a media center with [[XBMC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/modding-xbox-ultimate-multimedia-center,807.html|title=Modding The Xbox Into The Ultimate Multimedia Center|accessdate=2004-05-11|author=Patrick Schmid and Achim Roos|date=2007-07-18|publisher= Tom's Hardware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also distributions of Linux developed specifically for the Xbox, including those based on  [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=gentoox|title=Gentoox|publisher=distrowatch.com|date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Debian]], [[Damn Small Linux]] and [[Dyne:bolic]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

List of alternative operating systems:

*[[Xbox Linux]] is a project that ported [[Linux]] to the Xbox.
*[[FreeBSD]] and [[NetBSD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netbsd.org/releases/formal-5/NetBSD-5.0.html |title=Announcing NetBSD 5.0 |publisher=Netbsd.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been ported to Xbox.
*[[Microsoft Windows CE|Windows CE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=2077|title=Windows CE .Net 4.20 ported to Xbox|accessdate=2004-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[ReactOS]]
*A partial port of [[Windows XP]] is available on some modding websites but this usually involves removing the CPU and resoldering a different Pentium III as well as a heavily modified bios.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} One advantage over a regular, unmodded Xbox, is the ability to use a [[Cheating in video games|trainer]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
