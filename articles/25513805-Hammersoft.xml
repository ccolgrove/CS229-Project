'''''Music Ka Maha Muqqabla''''' ({{lang-hi|}} à¤®à¥à¤¯à¥à¤à¤¼à¤¿à¤ à¤à¤¾ à¤®à¤¹à¤¾ à¤®à¥à¤à¤¼à¤¾à¤¬à¤²à¤¾) was a reality show on [[STAR Plus]], which first aired on December 19, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Small screen's big musical battle! |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv-/Small-screens-big-musical-battle/articleshow/5351413.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=22 December 2009 |first1=Deepali |last1=Dhingra}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to bring a new format to music reality shows in India, which is based on teams rather than individuals. The show lasted for a total of 13 weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Ka Maha Muqabla on Star Plus&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Music Ka Maha Muqabla on Star Plus|url=http://www.realbollywood.com/news/2009/11/music-ka-maha-muqabla.html|work=realbollywood.com |date=3 January 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six teams, led by their own superstar captains, battled it out in this weekly music competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=talent hunt |url=http://www.dayafterindia.com/dec209/silver_screen2.html |work=The Day After |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=22 December 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singing superstars included [[Mika Singh]], [[Himesh Reshammiya]], [[Mohit Chauhan]], [[Shreya Ghoshal]], [[Shaan (singer)|Shaan]] and [[Shankar Mahadevan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Get ready for 'Music Ka Maha Muqqabla' |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv-/Get-ready-for-Music-Ka-Maha-Muqqabla/articleshow/5336434.cms |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=22 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each team consisted of three well-known singers and one new singer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Ka Maha Muqabla on Star Plus&quot;/&gt;

The show was hosted by [[Ayushmann Khurrana]]. Each week two captains competed for the highest score in order to win.

The captains that did not compete judged the performances of the singers. There were a total of five rounds in each competition. The audience and the judges gave the score. The show took place in a large outdoor stadium in [[Mumbai]]. The stadium consisted of a small section for a few audience members to stand very close to the stage. The rest of the audience sat in the back. Each member of the audience was given a voting machine where they voted when the host asked them to vote. The two competing teams sat on either side of the stage. The captains that did not compete sat in an area in front of the stage. There were background dancers that accompanied the singers when they sang. Two of the captains always sang in the final round and occasionally sang in any other rounds. A &quot;Singer of the Day&quot; Award was given at the end of each episode to a singer selected by the judges. The Grand Finale was won by Shankar Rockstars on 20 March 2010.
