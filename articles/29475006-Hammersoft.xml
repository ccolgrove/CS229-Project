==History==
When the [[Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company]] (''CompaÃ±Ã­a de TranvÃ­as Anglo-Argentina'', in Spanish) inaugurated on 1 December 1913 its Line 1 (Today, Line A of the subway), Plaza Onceâtoday Miserereâwas the terminus, and thanks to an agreement with the company's [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]] (''Ferrocarril Oeste de Buenos Aires'', in Spanish)âSarmiento todayâit was possible the design and construction of the subway station with the possibility of being used in a synchronized manner for both modes of transport. To do this, it was built with 6 tracks (4 for the subway and 2 for the train) and 4 platforms (2 lateral and two central).
