He is considered as Hungary's [[national poet]] and he was one of the key figures of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. He is the author of the &quot;''[[Nemzeti dal]]''&quot; (National Poem), the poem said to have inspired the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] that grew into a war for independence from the [[Austrian Empire]]. It is most likely that he died in the [[Battle of SegesvÃ¡r]], one of the last battles of the war.

==Early life==
PetÅfi was born in the early New Year's morning of 1823, in the town of [[KiskÅrÃ¶s]] ([[Kingdom of Hungary]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]). The population of KiskÅrÃ¶s was predominantly of Slovak origin as a consequence of the [[Habsburgs]]â reconstruction policy designed to settle, where possible, non-Hungarians in areas devastated during the [[Turkish wars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nyerges&quot;&gt;Anton N.

the family moved to KiskÅrÃ¶s a year before the birth of the poet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nyerges&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Petofi anyak.jpg|thumb|left|300px|PetÅfi's entry in the parish register in Latin (kept at the [[KiskÅrÃ¶s]] PetÅfi Museum).]] The family lived for some time in [[SzabadszÃ¡llÃ¡s]], where his father owned a slaughterhouse. Within two years, the family moved to [[KiskunfÃ©legyhÃ¡za]], and PetÅfi always viewed the city as his true home.  His father tried to give his son the best possible education, but when SÃ¡ndor was 15, the family lost its money, due to the [[Danube]] floods of 1838 and the bankruptcy of a relative. SÃ¡ndor had to leave the [[lyceum]] which he was attending in {{lang|hu|SelmecbÃ¡nya}} (today [[BanskÃ¡ Å tiavnica]] in Slovakia). He held small jobs in various theatres in [[Pest (city)|Pest]], worked as a teacher in [[Ostffyasszonyfa]], and was a soldier in [[Sopron]].

After a restless period of traveling, PetÅfi attended college at [[PÃ¡pa]], where he met [[MÃ³r JÃ³kai]]. A year later in 1842, his poem ''&quot;A borozÃ³&quot;'' (The Wine Drinker) was first published in ''Athenaeum'' under the name ''SÃ¡ndor Petrovics''. On 3 November the same year, he published the poem under the surname &quot;PetÅfi&quot; for the first time.

PetÅfi was more interested in the theater. In 1842 he joined a traveling theater, but had to leave it to earn money. He wrote for a newspaper, but could not make enough money.  Malnourished and sick, he went to [[Debrecen]], where his friends helped him get back on his feet.

In 1844 he walked from Debrecen to [[Pest (city)|Pest]] to find a publisher for his poems, in which he succeeded.  His poems were becoming increasingly popular. He relied on folkloric elements and popular, traditional song-like verses.

Among his longer works is the epic ''&quot;[[JÃ¡nos VitÃ©z]]&quot;'' (Sir John, 1845). The poem is a fairy-tale notable for its length, 370 quatrains divided into 27 chapters, and for its clever wordplay. It has gained immense popularity in [[Hungary]],&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;It has several musical and film adaptations and is today considered a classic of [[Hungarian literature]].&lt;/ref&gt; however, he felt influenced by his editor, Imre Vahot, to continue writing folklore-style poems, while he wanted to use his  Western-oriented education and write about growing revolutionary passions. (The government's censorship would have made such works difficult to publish.)

==Marriage and family==
In 1846, he met [[JÃºlia Szendrey]] in [[Transylvania]].  They married the next year, despite the opposition of her father, and spent their honeymoon at the castle of Count SÃ¡ndor Teleki, the only aristocrat among PetÅfi's friends.

==Political career==
PetÅfi became more possessed by thoughts of a global revolution. He and JÃºlia moved to Pest, where he joined a group of like-minded students and intellectuals who regularly met at [[CafÃ© Pilvax]]. They worked at promoting Hungarian as the language of literature and theatre, formerly based on French. (The first permanent theatre (the National Theatre) performing in Hungarian opened at this time.)

[[File:Petofi Sandor.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daguerreotype]] of SÃ¡ndor PetÅfi in 1844.]]

==The Hungarian Revolution of 1848==
Among the various young leaders of the revolution, called ''MÃ¡rciusi Ifjak'' (Youths of March),   PetÅfi was the key in starting the revolution in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]].  He was co-author and author, respectively, of the two most important written documents: the ''[[12 Pont]]'' (12 Points, demands to the Habsburg Governor-General) and the ''&quot;[[Nemzeti Dal]]&quot;'', his revolutionary poem.

When the news of the revolution in [[Vienna]] reached them on the 15th, PetÅfi and his friends decided to change the date of the &quot;National Assembly&quot; (a rally where a petition to the Hungarian noblemen's assembly would be approved by the people), from 19 March to the 15th. On the morning of the 15th, PetÅfi and the revolutionaries began to march around the city of Pest, reading his poem and the &quot;12 Points&quot; to the growing crowd, which attracted thousands.  Visiting printers, they declared an end to censorship and printed the poem and &quot;12 Points&quot;.

Crowds forced the mayor to sign the &quot;12 Points&quot; and later held a mass demonstration in front of the newly built [[Hungarian National Museum|National Museum]], then crossed to [[Buda]] on the other bank of the Danube. When the crowd rallied in front of the Imperial governing council, the representatives of [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand]] felt they had to sign the &quot;12 Points&quot;. As one of the points was freedom for political prisoners, the crowd moved to greet the newly freed revolutionary poet [[MihÃ¡ly TÃ¡ncsics]].

PetÅfi's popularity waned as the memory of the glorious day faded, and the revolution went the way of high politics: to the leadership of the nobles. Those in the noblemen's Assembly in [[Bratislava#Names|Pozsony]], (today ''Bratislava'') had been pushing for slower reforms at the same time, which they delivered to the Emperor on the 13th, but events had overtaken them briefly. PetÅfi disagreed with the Assembly, and criticised their view of the goals and methods of the Revolution. (His colleague TÃ¡ncsics was imprisoned again by the new government.) In the general election, PetÅfi ran in his native area, but did not win a seat. At this time, he wrote his most serious poem, ''Az Apostol'' (The Apostle).  It was an [[Epic poetry|epic]] about a fictional revolutionary who, after much suffering, attempts, but fails, to assassinate a fictitious king.

PetÅfi joined [[Poland|Polish]] [[Classical Liberalism|Liberal]] General [[JÃ³zef Bem]]'s &quot;Transylvanian army&quot;, which initially was successful against Habsburg troops, [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]], [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Transylvanian Saxon]] [[militia]]s.  After Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] intervened to restore the Hapsburgs, the Transylvanians were repeated defeated. Last seen alive in the [[battle of SegesvÃ¡r]] on 31 July 1849.

==Death==
PetÅfi is believed to have been [[killed in action]] during the battle of SegesvÃ¡r by the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. A Russian military doctor recorded an account of PetÅfi's death in his diary.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} As his body was never officially found, rumours of PetÅfi's survival persisted. In his autobiographical [[roman a clef]] ''Political Fashions'' (''Politikai divatok'', 1862), [[MÃ³r JÃ³kai]] imagined his late friend's &quot;resurrection&quot;.  In the novel PetÅfi (the character named Pusztafi) returns ten years later as a shabby, ''dÃ©classÃ©'' figure who has lost his faith in everything, poetry, too.

Though for many years his death at SegesvÃ¡r had been assumed, in the late 1980s Soviet investigators found archives that revealed that after the battle about 1,800 Hungarian prisoners of war were marched to [[Siberia]]. Alternative theories suggest that he was one of them and died of tuberculosis in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/454072/Sandor-Petofi Sandor Petofi (Hungarian poet) â Britannica Online Encyclopedia]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 17 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, an expedition was organized to [[Barguzin River|Barguzin]], Siberia, where [[archaeologists]] claimed to have unearthed PetÅfi's skeleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Makkai|title=In Quest of the 'Miracle Stag'|page=298|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1996|isbn=0964209403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry ==
PetÅfi started his career as a poet with &quot;popular situation songs&quot;, a genre to which his first published poem, ''A borozÃ³'' (&quot;The Wine Drinker&quot;, 1842), belongs. It is the song of a drinker praising the healing power of wine to drive away all troubles. This kind of pseudo-folk song was not unusual in Hungarian poetry of the 1840s, but PetÅfi soon developed an original and fresh voice which made him stand out. He wrote many folk song-like poems on the subjects of wine, love, [[Romanticism|romantic]] robbers etc. Many of these early poems have become classics, for example the love poem ''A virÃ¡gnak megtiltani nem lehet'' (&quot;You Cannot Forbid the Flower&quot;, 1843), or ''Befordultam a konyhÃ¡ra'' (&quot;I Turned into the Kitchen&quot;, 1843) which uses the ancient metaphor of love and fire in a playful and somewhat provocative way.

The influence of folk poetry and 19th-century populism is very significant in PetÅfi's work, but other influences are also present: PetÅfi drew on sources such as [[topoi]] of contemporary [[almanac]]-poetry in an inventive way, and was familiar with the works of major literary figures of his day, including [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[Pierre-Jean de BÃ©ranger]] and [[Heinrich Heine]].

PetÅfi's early poetry was often interpreted as some kind of role-playing, due to the broad range of situations and voices he created and used. Recent interpretations however call attention to the fact that in some sense all lyrical poetry can be understood as role-playing, which makes the category of &quot;role-poems&quot; (coined especially for PetÅfi) superfluous. While using a variety of voices, PetÅfi created a well-formed [[persona]] for himself: a jaunty, stubborn loner who loves wine, hates all kinds of limits and boundaries and is passionate in all he feels. In poems such as ''JÃ¶vendÃ¶lÃ©s'' (&quot;Prophecy&quot;, 1843) he imagines himself as someone who will die young after doing great things. This motif recurs in the revolutionary poetry of his later years.

The influence of contemporary almanac-poetry can be best seen in the poem cycle ''Cipruslombok Etelke sÃ­rjÃ¡ra'' (&quot;Branches of Cypress for Etelke's Tomb&quot;, 1845). These sentimental poems, which are about death, grief, love, memory and loneliness were written after a love interest of PetÅfi's, Etelke CsapÃ³, died.

In the years 1844â45 PetÅfi's poetry became more and more subtle and mature. New subjects appeared, such as landscape. His most influential landscape poem is ''Az AlfÃ¶ld'' (&quot;The Plains&quot;), in which he says that his homeland, the [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plains]] are more beautiful and much dearer than the [[Carpathian mountains]]; it was to become the foundation of a long-lived fashion: that of the plains as the typical Hungarian landscape.

PetÅfi's poetic skills solidified and broadened. He became a master of using different kinds of voices, for example his poem ''A rÃ©gi, jÃ³ GvadÃ¡nyi'' (&quot;The Good Old GvadÃ¡nyi&quot;) imitates the style of [[JÃ³zsef GvadÃ¡nyi]], a Hungarian poet who lived at the end of the 18th century.

It is interesting to note that several of PetÅfi's poems were set to music by the young Friedrich Nietzsche, who composed as a hobby while studying classics at Pforta before beginning his career in philosophy.

PetÅfi maintained a lifelong friendship with [[JÃ¡nos Arany]], another significant poet of the time. Arany was the godfather of PetÅfi's son [[ZoltÃ¡n PetÅfi|ZoltÃ¡n]].

== Honours and memorials ==
[[File:Petofi Budapest.jpg|thumb|right|150px|PetÅfi statue in Budapest.]]
After the Revolution was crushed, PetÅfi's writing became immensely popular, while his rebelliousness served as a role model ever since for Hungarian revolutionaries and would-be revolutionaries of every political colour.

During the late 1940s, [[Boris Pasternak]] produced acclaimed translations of PetÅfi's poems into the [[Russian language]].

Today, streets and squares are named after him throughout Hungary and Hungarian-speaking regions of neighboring states; in Budapest alone, there are 11 PetÅfi streets and 4 PetÅfi squares, see: [[Public place names of Budapest]]. A [[Hungarian Radio|national radio station]] (Radio PetÅfi), a [[PetÅfi Bridge|bridge]] in [[Budapest]] and a street in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria also bear his name, as well as the [[asteroid]] [[4483 PetÃ¶fi]], a member of the [[Hungaria family]].

PetÅfi has a larger than life [[terra cotta]] statue near the Pest end of [[ErzsÃ©bet Bridge]], sculpted by [[MiklÃ³s IzsÃ³]] and [[Adolf HuszÃ¡r]]. Similar PetÅfi statues were established in many other cities, as well, during the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer, [http://books.google.com.au/books?id=YINYl4iv4ecC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Petofi+statues%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3K6CTr3BOOiPiAeqtcHyDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Pet%C5%91fi%20statues%20&amp;f=false HISTORY OF THE LITERARY CULTURES OF EAST-CENTRAL E], John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2010, pp  15â16&lt;/ref&gt;
