'''Line in the Sand match''' is the unofficial title of the infamous '''[[2004 AFL season#Round 11|Round 11, 2004]]''' match between [[Australian rules football|Australian football]] clubs '''{{AFL Haw}}''' and '''{{AFL Ess}}''' played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] on Saturday, 5 June 2004.

A number of incidents in the third quarter led to some fights breaking out all over the ground eventually turning into a five minute bench-clearing brawl. Following the brawl, Essendon made a stand on the scoreboard, kicking 14 goals to Hawthorn's six to record a 74-point win.

18 players from both clubs faced the wrath of the [[AFL Tribunal]] on 8 and 9 June 2004 with record suspensions and fines handed out.

==Background==
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Hawthorn experienced a golden era by making every Grand Final from 1983 to 1989 and again in 1991, victorious on five occasions.

During this time, they came up against the Bombers on three occasions - [[1983 VFL Grand Final|1983]], [[1984 VFL Grand Final|1984]] and [[1985 VFL Grand Final|1985]]. The Hawks comfortably won in 1983 and the Bombers followed up with [[List of Australian Football League premiers#Back-to-back premierships|back-to-back]] wins in 1984 and 1985. Throughout this decade, both clubs were known to play hard, attacking brands of football resulting in lots of biffs, bumps and brawls. It was during this decade that the rivalry between the two clubs really took hold, continuing to this day.

Essendon continued to intimidate opposition clubs in the late 1990s and into the early years of the 21st century, resulting in more Premiership success and a dominant era over Hawthorn. Essendon entered the match having won 9 of the previous 10 meetings between the two clubs, by an average margin of 39 points.

Prior to the match, the Olympic Torch entered the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], venue for the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympic Games]], on the Australian leg of the Olympic Torch Relay. Just the night before, the torch entered Sydney's [[Stadium Australia|Telstra Stadium]], venue of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Games]], prior to the [[National Rugby League|NRL]] match between the [[Bulldogs (NRL team)|Bulldogs]] and [[Sydney Roosters]].

==During the match==
===Lead up to the brawl===

Hawthorn players were allegedly directed at half time, by Club Director [[Dermott Brereton]] who played for the Hawks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dermie-ref&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Hinds|title=Heavier blows to come for Hawks, Bombers|date=7 June 2004|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/06/1086460175315.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; and take a physical stand against the Bombers to make it clear that they wouldn't take the intimidation any longer. Brereton denied the allegation but admitted to advising senior players &quot;to stand up to any Essendon aggression&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Lines|date=6 June 2004|title=AFL: I didn't order fight - Brereton|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-95261082.html|publisher=AAP Sports News (Australia)|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the first two minutes of the third quarter, [[Mark L. Williams|Mark Williams]] kicked Hawthorn's 6th goal of the match to cut Essendon's lead to 26 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=5 June 2004|title=Saturday Afternoon Football: Hawthorn v Essendon|url=http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3|publisher=[[Network 10]]|location=Melbourne|time=1:22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the centre bounce, several players were on the ground vigorously attempting to gain possession of the ball and clear it for their team. [[Mark Johnson (footballer)|Mark Johnson]] of Essendon attempted to join in at a stoppage but was quickly removed by a number of Hawthorn players. This led to some wrestling and jumper punches amongst the players with approximately 16 players in the centre square at the time. Channel 10 commentators said that the spirit was &quot;bubbling over a little&quot;.
A free kick was awarded to Hawthorn and the ball was quickly kicked forward. The Hawks were unable to take a mark inside their forward 50 and the ball fell into [[Mark Bolton]]'s hands who was able to clear for the Bombers. He kicked the ball along the southern side of the ground with the aim of reaching [[Jason Winderlich]] who, while attempting to mark close to the ground, copped a very hard knock from Hawthorn's [[Chance Bateman]], possibly a knee or hip connecting with his head. A free kick was awarded to Winderlich who was forced from the ground under the [[blood rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=5 June 2004|title=Saturday Afternoon Football: Hawthorn v Essendon|url=http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3|publisher=[[Network 10]]|location=Melbourne|time=2:50 - 3:50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brawl===

A number of brawls broke out on the Great Southern Stand side of the centre square with many players getting involved. Players tackled each other to the ground, threw fist and jumper punches and wrestled with each other with Hawthorn's Richie Vandenberg and Lance Picioane particularly active and Essendon's Adam McPhee, Mark Johnson and Justin Murphy were keen to respond.&lt;ref name=&quot;dermie-ref&quot; /&gt; As Winderlich continued off the ground in the arms of trainers he was struck by Campbell Brown of Hawthorn, after the match described by Matthew Lloyd as &quot;one of the most disgusting things I've seen on a football field&quot;. [[Network 10|Channel 10]] commentators described it as &quot;the 1980s revisited&quot;, &quot;unbelievable&quot; and stated &quot;we haven't seen these sort of scenes for a long time in AFL Football&quot;. Trainers, runners and some senior players were seen restraining and dragging their club's players away from opposition players, while [[Adam McPhee]] had to be restrained and given marching orders from Bruce Connor, Essendon's Head Physiotherapist, to receive attention to a bloodied eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=5 June 2004|title=Saturday Afternoon Football: Hawthorn v Essendon|url=http://bigpondvideo.com/AFL/14937?Quarters=3|publisher=[[Network 10]]|location=Melbourne|time=5:33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the brawl===

A few follow-up scuffles occurred but Essendon regained composure and hit back hard on the scoreboard, kicking 9 of the next 10 goals to extend the three-quarter time lead to 74 points. A 10-goal final quarter, 5 to each team, left the margin as it was at three-quarter time, with the Bombers recording a 74-point win.

==The fallout (reports)==
The fallout from the match was significant, with a record 18 players reported on a record 26 charges. Some players were reported by umpires on the field,&lt;ref name=&quot;match-reports&quot;&gt;{{cite web
