'''Wiregrass Ranch High School''' is a [[Pasco County, Florida|Pasco County]] [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] in [[Wesley Chapel, Florida]], USA. It was the first new high school in Pasco County in seven years and was built to relieve overcrowding primarily at [[Wesley Chapel High School]]. In the first part of the 2006/2007 school year, it was based in portables behind John Long Middle School and used much of their facilities, such as their cafeteria and media center before the permanent facility opened in January 2007.
