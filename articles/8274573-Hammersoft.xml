The '''2005 Washington State Cougars football team''' represented [[Washington State University]] in the [[college football]] [[2005 NCAA Division I-A football season|season of 2005-2006]]. The team was led by third-year head coach [[Bill Doba]], and played its home games at [[Martin Stadium]] in [[Pullman, Washington|Pullman]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

==Season==
Washington State was picked fifth in the pre-season Pac-Ten conference poll. They were even classified by some as a sleeper pick for the national championship, with [[Alex Brink]] at the helm. They started out the season 3-0, with blow-out wins over their opponents. Against {[[2005 Oregon State Beavers football team|Oregon State]], Alex Brink passed for over 500 yards, but his team still lost. The team lost their next 3 games to Stanford, UCLA, and Cal by a combined 10 points. Basically, the Cougars had an inability to close-out football games, and that cost them.
