==Series overview==

Like any accident and emergency department, Holby City Hospital A&amp;E is a hectic, chaotic whirl of hospital staff, patients and visitors. But scratch the surface and there are gripping stories on all sides. Casualty interweaves these intriguing, exciting and dramatic tales with the loves and lives of the hospital staff in a compelling hospital drama series that has continued for over 20 years.

Following the tragic death of Selena Donovan at the end of Series 21, the staff of Holby City's Emergency Department find themselves thrown back into the thick of the action. With Corporate Mangager Nathan Spencer ([[Ben Price]]) struggling to cope with looking after Angel and new Executive Director Marilyn Fox ([[Caroline Langrishe]]) determined to ring in the changes it looks as if the first casualty will be Nathan himself.

Series 22 saw the arrival of many new characters to the team which included F2s Ruth Winters (Georgia Taylor) and Toby De Silva (Matthew Needham), Consultants Adam Trueman ([[Tristan Gemmill]]) and Zoe Hanna ([[Sunetra Sarker]]), Porter Big Mac ([[Charles Dale]]), Receptionist Noel Garcia ([[Tony Marshall (actor)|Tony Marshall]]), Paramedics Snezana Lalovic ([[Ivana Basic]]) and Curtis Cooper ([[Abdul Salis]]), Orthopaedic Consultant Sean Anderson ([[Richard Dillane]]) and his wife, Staff Nurse Jessica Harrison ([[Gillian Kearney]]) and Clinical Nurse Manager Simon Tanner ([[Paul Fox]]).

Dramatic changes in Series 22 included the departures of many beloved characters such as the long serving Josh Griffiths ([[Ian Bleasdale]])and Harry Harper ([[Simon MacCorkindale]]) and as the series drew to a close it seemed yet another loved character was due to leave as Dr. Maggie Coldwell ([[Susan Cookson]]) quit Holby following a vicious court case.
