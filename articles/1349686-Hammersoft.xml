'''Richard Allan Bartle''' (born 10 January 1960 in [[Ripon]], [[England]]) is a [[British people|British]] [[writer]], [[professor]] and game [[researcher]], best known for being the co-creator of ''[[MUD1]]'' (the first [[MUD]]) and the author of the seminal ''[[Designing Virtual Worlds]]''. He is one of the pioneers of the [[massively multiplayer online game]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;Radoff, Jon (April 2011). ''Game On: Energize Your Business with Social Media Games.'' p. 36. Wiley. ISBN 978-0470936269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
[[Image:MUDscreen.jpg|thumb|right|256px|A screenshot from ''[[MUD1]]'', the first [[MUD]]]]
Bartle received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[artificial intelligence]] from the [[University of Essex]], where he created ''[[MUD1]]'' with [[Roy Trubshaw]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Bartle, R: [ftp://ftp.lambda.moo.mud.org/pub/MOO/papers/mudreport.txt &quot;Interactive Multi-User Computer Games&quot;], section 1.5; Retrieved on 2009-01-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

He lectured at Essex until 1987, when he left to work full time on ''MUD'' (known as ''[[MUD2]]'' in its present version). Recently he has returned to the university as a part-time professor and principal teaching fellow in the Department of Computing and Electronic Systems, supervising courses on computer [[game design]] as part of the department's degree course on computer [[game development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/default.aspx?coursecode=EE224&amp;level=5&amp;period=FY|title=University of Essex Module Details - EE224-5-FY: Computer Games Architecture and Design|accessdate=January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he wrote ''[[Designing Virtual Worlds]]'', a book about the history, ethics, structure, and technology of massively multiplayer games.

Bartle is also a contributing editor to ''[[Terra Nova (blog)|Terra Nova]]'', a collaborative blog that deals with [[virtual world]] issues.

Bartle did research on player personality types in massively-multiplayer online games. In Bartle's analysis, players of [[massively multiplayer online game]]s can be divided into four types: achievers, explorers, socializers and killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bartle, R|url=http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm|title=Players Who Suit MUDs|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea has been adapted into a popular online test generally referred to as the [[Bartle Test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmorpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&amp;ID=951 |title=Random Dialogue: You Shuffle, I'll Deal(archived)|date=April 26, 2004|accessdate=January 31, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071223023405/http://www.mmorpgdot.com/index.php?hsaction=10053&amp;ID=951 |archivedate = December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The test is very popular and scores are often exchanged on MMORPG forums and networking sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerdna.com/quizzes/bartle-test-of-gamer-psychology|title=Bartle Test of Gamer Psychology|accessdate=January 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circa 2003, Bartle was reported as living in a village near [[Colchester]], England, with his wife Gail and their two children Jennifer and Madeleine.&lt;ref name=&quot;dog&quot;&gt;{{cite book
