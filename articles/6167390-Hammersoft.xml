'''MacKenzie Grace Mauzy''' (born October 14, 1988 in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]].

==Career==
Mauzy played the role of [[Phoebe Forrester]] on [[CBS]] [[soap opera]] ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' until December 2008 (she joined the cast on July 11, 2006).

She also played [[Lizzie Spaulding]] on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[Guiding Light]]'' from October 2000 to August 2002. She has also guest starred on [[CBS]]'s ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', ''[[CSI: NY]]'' and [[NBC]]'s ''[[Law &amp; Order: SVU]]''.

Before launching her acting career, Mauzy worked in [[New York]], [[Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]] in stage productions of classic plays such as [[A Christmas Carol]], [[Snow White]] and [[Macbeth]]. In 1998, Mauzy won the Anna Wentworth award for &quot;best child actress&quot; for her role as Annie Warbucks in the production of ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at the showtimes theatre in Roanoke, Virginia.

In July 2008, MacKenzie was originally cast as Ilse in the 1st National Tour of the hit Broadway musical [[Spring Awakening]]. The role went to Steffi D (a [[Canadian Idol]] finalist) because MacKenzie turned it down in order to be in the Broadway musical, ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''. Based on one of [[Charles Dickens]] most popular novels, ''A Tale of Two Cities'' is set against the backdrop of the [[French Revolution]] and centers on the themes of injustice, vengeance and the redemptive power of love. Mauzy played [[The Seamstress (A Tale of Two Cities)|The Seamstress]] in the musical, which was executive produced by [[Barbara Russell]] and [[Ron Sharpe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadway.com/gen/Buzz_Story.aspx?ci=568046], Broadway.com, July 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The play, which cost $16 million to produce, closed on November 16, 2009 after 33 previews and 68 regular performances.

More recently, Mauzy joined the Broadway cast of [[Next to Normal]], temporarily standing by for [[Jennifer Damiano]] as Natalie Goodman. She then succeeded [[Meghann Fahy]] as Natalie Standby, with Fahy replacing Jennifer Damiano as the fulltime Natalie. Mauzy stayed with the Broadway production (going on for various times) until the Broadway production closed on Sunday, January 16, 2011 after 21 previews and 733 regular performances.

Currently, Mackenzie Mauzy has a starring role in the controversial new musical, ''White Noise'', which is, in part, based on a real life white supremacist pop duo, [[Prussian Blue]].  ''White Noise'' is playing a limited run at the Royal George theater in [[Chicago, IL]].  The play is presented by [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and it opened on April 9, 2011 and received remarkable reviews and excellent audience feedback.  It takes the audience on a frightening ride through the world of contemporary pop music with a special emphasis on &quot;coded&quot; racist lyrics.  Learning materials have been prepared for the play by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]].
