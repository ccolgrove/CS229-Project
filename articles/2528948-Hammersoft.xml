'''British Airways Flight 9''', sometimes referred to by its callsign '''Speedbird 9''' or '''Jakarta incident''',&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Box&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last= Faith |first=Nicholas | year=1998 | page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a scheduled [[British Airways]] flight from [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] to [[Auckland]], with stops in [[Bombay]], [[Madras]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and [[Melbourne]]. 

On 24 June 1982, the route was flown by the ''City of Edinburgh'', a [[Boeing 747|747-236B]]. The aircraft flew into a cloud of [[volcanic ash]] thrown up by the eruption of [[Galunggung|Mount Galunggung]] (approximately {{convert|180|km|mi}} south-east of [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]]), resulting in the failure of all four engines. The reason for the failure was not immediately apparent to the crew or ground control. The aircraft was diverted to Jakarta in the hope that enough engines could be restarted to allow it to land there. The aircraft was able to glide far enough to exit the ash cloud, and all engines were restarted (although one failed again soon after), allowing the aircraft to land safely at the [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport]] in Jakarta.

The crew members of the incident segment had boarded the aircraft in Kuala Lumpur, while many of the passengers had been aboard since the flight began in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falling from the Sky&quot;&gt;Episode &quot;Falling from the Sky&quot; from the TV series ''[[Mayday (TV series)|Mayday]]'' (''Air Emergency'', ''Air Crash Investigation'') [documentary TV series].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
Shortly after 13:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (20:40 Jakarta time) above the [[Indian Ocean]], south of [[Java]], the flight crew (consisting of [[First Officer (civil aviation)|Senior First Officer]] Roger Greaves and [[flight engineer|Senior Engineer Officer]] Barry Townley-Freeman while [[Captain (civil aviation)|Captain]] Eric Moody was in the lavatory) first noted an effect on the [[windscreen]] similar to [[St Elmo's fire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Box&quot;/&gt; The phenomenon persisted after Moody  returned from the lavatory. Despite the [[weather radar]] showing clear skies, the crew switched on engine anti-ice and the passenger seat belt signs as a precaution.

As the flight progressed, smoke began to gather throughout the passenger cabin of the aircraft and it was at first assumed to be cigarette smoke. However, it soon began to grow thicker and had an ominous odour of [[sulphur]]. Passengers who had a view out of the aircraft windows noted that the engines were unusually bright with the light shining forward through the fan blades and producing a [[stroboscopic effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Disaster&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=[[Macarthur Job|Job]]| first=Macarthur | year=1994 | pages=96â107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately 13:42 UTC (20:42 Jakarta time), engine number four began [[Compressor stall|surging]] and soon [[flameout|flamed out]]. The flight crew immediately performed the engine shutdown drill, quickly cutting off fuel supply and arming the fire extinguishers. Less than a minute later, at 13:43 UTC (20:43 Jakarta time), engine two surged and flamed out. Within seconds, and almost simultaneously, engines one and three flamed out prompting the flight engineer to exclaim, &quot;I don't believe itâall four engines have failed!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Disaster&quot;/&gt;

Without engine thrust, a 747-200 has a [[glide ratio]] of approximately 15:1, meaning it can glide forward 15 kilometres for every kilometre it drops. The flight crew quickly determined that the aircraft was capable of gliding for 23 minutes and covering {{convert|91|nmi|km}} from its flight level of {{convert|37000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Disaster&quot;/&gt; At 13:44 UTC (20:44 Jakarta time), Greaves  [[Distress signal#Aviation distress signals|declared an emergency]] to the local [[air traffic control]] authority, stating that all four engines had failed. However, Jakarta Area Control misunderstood the message, interpreting the call as meaning that only [[Aircraft engine position number|engine number]] four had shut down. It was only after a nearby [[Garuda Indonesia]] flight relayed the message to Air Traffic Control that it was understood. Despite the crew &quot;squawking&quot; the emergency [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] setting of 7700, the aeroplane could not be located by Air Traffic Control on their radar screens.

Many passengers wrote notes to relatives. One such passenger was Charles Capewell who wrote &quot;Ma. In trouble. Plane going down. Will do best for boys. We love you. Sorry. Pa XXX&quot; scrawled on the cover of his ticket wallet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falling from the Sky&quot;/&gt;

Due to the high Indonesian mountains on the south coast of the island of [[Java]], an altitude of at least {{convert|11500|ft|m}} was required to cross the coast safely. The crew decided that if the aircraft was unable to maintain altitude by the time they reached {{convert|12000|ft|m}} they would turn back out to sea and attempt to [[Water landing|ditch]] into the Indian Ocean. The crew began the engine restart drills, despite being well above the recommended maximum engine in-flight start envelope altitude of {{convert|28000|ft|m}}. The attempts failed.

Despite the lack of time, Moody made an announcement to the passengers that has been described as &quot;a masterpiece of [[understatement]]&quot;:&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Disaster&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/04/15/volcanic.ash.aviation.explainer/index.html?hpt=T1 Explainer: Why ash cloud endangers aircraft]. CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We have a small problem. All four engines have stopped. We are doing our damnedest to get them going again. I trust you are not in too much distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8622099.stm | work=BBC News | title=When volcanic ash stopped a Jumbo at 37,000ft | date=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As pressure within the cabin fell, oxygen masks dropped from the ceilingâan automatic emergency measure to make up for the lack of air. On the flight deck however, Greaves's mask was broken; the delivery tube had detached from the rest of the mask. Moody swiftly decided to descend at 1,800 m per minute to an altitude where there was enough pressure in the outside atmosphere to breathe almost normally.

At {{convert|13,500|ft|m}}, they were approaching the altitude at which they would have to turn over the ocean and attempt a risky ditching. Although there were guidelines for the procedure, no one had ever tried it in a Boeing 747, nor has anyone since. As they performed the engine-restart procedure, engine number four started, and at 13:56 UTC (20:56 Jakarta time), Moody used its power to reduce the rate of descent. Shortly thereafter, engine three restarted, allowing him to climb slowly. Shortly after that, engines one and two successfully restarted as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stewart&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=Stanley | title=Emergency: Crisis on the Flight Deck| publisher=The Crowood Press | year=2002 | isbn=978-1840373936 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew subsequently requested  and expedited an increase in altitude to {{convert|11500|ft|m}} in order to clear the high mountains of Indonesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tootell&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Tootell | first=Betty | year=1985 |page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the aircraft approached its target altitude, the [[St Elmo's fire]] effect on the windscreen returned. Moody throttled back; however, engine number two surged again and had to be shut down. The crew immediately descended and held {{convert|12000|ft|m}}.

As Flight 9 approached Jakarta, the crew found it difficult to see anything through the windscreen, and had to make the approach almost entirely on instruments, despite reports of good visibility. The crew decided to fly the ILS, [[Instrument Landing System]], however, the glideslope was inoperative, so they flew the localizer as the first officer monitored the airport's DME ([[Distance Measuring Equipment]]). He then called out how high they should be at each DME step along the final approach to the runway, creating a virtual glide slope for them to follow. It was, in Moody's words, &quot;a bit like negotiating one's way up a [[badger]]'s arse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Box&quot;/&gt; Although the runway lights could be made out through a small strip of the windscreen, the landing lights on the aircraft seemed to be inoperable. After landing, the flight crew found it impossible to taxi, due to glare from apron floodlights which made the already sandblasted windscreen opaque.

==Aftermath==
[[File:British-Airways-Flight-9 turbine and compressor blades.JPG|thumb|Damaged engine parts from BA 9 on display at [[Auckland Museum]]]]
It was found that ''City of Edinburgh'''s problems had been caused by flying through a cloud of [[volcanic ash]] from the eruption of [[Galunggung|Mount Galunggung]]. Because the ash cloud was dry, it did not show up on the weather radar, which is designed to detect the moisture in clouds. The cloud sandblasted the windscreen and landing light covers and clogged the engines. As the ash entered the engines, it melted in the combustion chambers and adhered to the inside of the power-plant. As the engine cooled from not running and as the aircraft descended out of the ash cloud, the molten ash solidified and enough broke off to allow air to flow smoothly through the engine allowing a successful restart. The engines had enough electrical power to restart because one generator and the onboard batteries were still operating; electrical power is required for ignition of the engines. 

Engines one, two and three were replaced at Jakarta, as well as the windscreen, and the fuel tanks were cleared of the ash that had entered them through the pressurisation ducts, contaminating the fuel and requiring that it be disposed of. After being ferried back to London, engine number four was replaced and major work was undertaken to return the aircraft to service. G-BDXH also entered the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the longest glide in a non-purpose-built aircraft, until the record was broken by the [[Air Transat Flight 236]] incident.

Although the airspace around Mount Galunggung was closed temporarily after the incident, it was re-opened days later. It was only after a [[Singapore Airlines]] 747 was forced to shut down three of its engines while flying through the same area nineteen days later (13 July), that Indonesian authorities closed the airspace permanently and re-routed airways to avoid the area, and a watch was set up to monitor clouds of ash.&lt;ref name=&quot;Air Disaster&quot;/&gt; Flight 9 was not the first encounter with this eruption; a [[Garuda Indonesia|Garuda]] DC-9 had encountered ash on 5 April 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bom.gov.au/info/vaac/galunggung.shtml Earlier DC-9 encounter]. Retrieved on 2009-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew received various awards, including the [[Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air]] and medals from the [[British Air Line Pilots Association]]. Following the incident, the crew and passengers formed the Galunggung Gliding Club as a means to keep in contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Brennan |first = Zoe |title = The story of flight 009 and the words every passenger dreads... |work = Daily Mail |date = 27 January 2007 |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=431802&amp;in_page_id=1770 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the passengers, Betty Tootell, wrote a book about the incident, ''All Four Engines Have Failed''. She managed to trace some 200 of the 247 passengers on the flight, and went on to marry a fellow survivor, James Ferguson, who had been seated in the row in front of her. She notes: &quot;The 28th December 2006 marks the start of our 14th year of honeymoon, and on the 24th June 2007 many passengers and crew will no doubt gather to celebrate the 25th anniversary of our mid-air adventure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maturetimes.co.uk/node/1847 Betty Tootell talking about her life].

British Airways continues to operate the Flight 9 route from [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] to [[Suvarnabhumi Airport|Bangkok]] and [[Sydney Airport|Sydney]]. ''City of Edinburgh'', later renamed ''City of Elgin'', continued to fly for British Airways after the incident, before being sold to [[European Aviation Air Charter]]. The aircraft was taken out of service in February 2004 and the 30-year old aircraft was scrapped in 2009. In September 2009 the environmental group [[10:10]] bought the fuselage of ''City Of Edinburgh'' to be made into tags. The tags, bearing the campaign's logo, are worn as necklaces or bracelets and are used to raise awareness of 10:10's work, the organisation aims to primarily persuade individuals, organizations and businesses to reduce their carbon emissions by 10% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8607822.stm|title=Jumbo push over greenhouse gasses |date=7 April 2010 |publisher=BBC Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident featured in an episode of the ''Mayday'' documentary TV series ''[[Mayday (TV series)|Air Crash Investigation]]'' titled &quot;Falling From the Sky&quot;.  This episode was repeated a number of times when the [[2010 eruptions of EyjafjallajÃ¶kull|EyjafjallajÃ¶kull]] volcano caused a large-scale shutdown of European airspace.

Captain Eric Moody gave an interview to the July 2010 edition of [[Flaps Podcast]], where he recounted his experience.

A nearly identical incident occurred on 15 December 1989 when [[KLM Flight 867]], a B747-400 from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], flew into the plume of the erupting [[Mount Redoubt (Alaska)|Mount Redoubt]], causing all four engines to fail due to [[compressor stall]]. Once the flight cleared the ash cloud, the crew was able to restart each engine and then make a safe landing at Anchorage.&lt;ref name=flight867&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Witkin
