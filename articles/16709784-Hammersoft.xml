The '''Battle of Britain Memorial''' is a monument to aircrew who flew in the [[Battle of Britain]].  It is sited on the [[White Cliffs of Dover|White Cliffs]] at [[Capel-le-Ferne]], near [[Folkestone]], on the coast of [[Kent]].  It was initiated by the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust, and opened by the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Mother]] on July 9 1993.  It is formed of a large propellor shape, with the figure of a seated pilot carved by Harry Gray sitting at the centre .  Also on the site are replicas of a [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] and the [[Christopher Foxley-Norris]] Memorial Wall, on which appears the names of the almost 3000 fighter aircrew who flew in the Battle. In October 2010 HRH The Duchess of Cornwall unveiled a bust of Air Chief Marshal Sir Keith Park by Sculptor Will Davies at the site. The Trust is currently raising money to build a new visitor centre. It will take the shape of a Spitfire wing and will be called &quot;The Wing&quot;.
