The '''FIU Golden Panthers football''' team represent [[Florida International University]] in [[Miami, Florida]] in the sport of [[college football]]. The [[FIU Panthers]] are a [[mid-major]] [[NCAA]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] [[college football]] team in the [[Sun Belt Conference]] led by [[Mario Cristobal]] and play at the on-campus [[FIU Stadium]].

==History==
On 1 September 1999, when after several years of contemplating the commencement of a football team, FIU moved a step closer by hiring [[Don Strock]] to be FIUâs Director of Football Operations. One year later, [[Don Strock]] was named Head Coach with plans to lay the foundations for a college football team. QB David Tabor was the first FIU football recruit. In February 2002, FIU found its star QB in highly touted Jamie Burke from Cardinal Mooney High, Sarasota, FL. Burke was the only player to ever throw for over 500 yards in a single game in Florida as well as led the state in touchdown passes in a season with 34. Burke was being recruited by the [[University of Florida]] but opted instead for FIU when [[Steve Spurrier]] left to coach the [[Washington Redskins]]. FIU had everything it needed to begin competing in [[NCAA]] Football. FIU was placed in the [[Division I-AA]] level as an Independent team.

===Early years===
FIU won its inaugural game on 29 August 2002 against [[Saint Peter's College (New Jersey)]], 27â3. The team faired fairly well against the competition that season and managed to finish with a 5-6 record. The Golden Panthers then hoped to build on that in the coming 2003 season. FIU signed to play more challenging teams of the division in hopes to get more recognition as a solid football team. The opening game of the following season started with a loss to Indiana State and it led to a 0â8 start for the second year team. They failed to reach the standard set the season before and fell to a 2â10 season. The next season followed with similar results, finishing with a 3â7 record.

After the 2004 season, FIU moved up to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] FBS, formerly known as [[Division I-A]], despite their relative lack of success in their first three seasons in Division 1 FCS.  FIU became the fastest school in the history of college football to reach the highest level.

===Recent history===
{{See also|Florida International University â University of Miami brawl}}

[[Image:FIU Stadium.JPG|thumb|thumb|250px|The Panthers play at the on-campus [[FIU Stadium]] in [[Miami, Florida]].]]

The Panthers moved to Division I-A in 2005. Many of the season's players were from the 2003 recruiting class. [[Keyonvis Bouie]], FIU's linebacker recorded 118 tackles in nine games, 11 for a loss and three interceptions. A second linebacker, [[Antwan Barnes]] recorded 15 tackles for a loss and added 11 sacks to his statistics. On offense, FIU's quarterback, [[Josh Padrick]] who passed for 2743 yards and 13 touchdowns. His primary target was [[Chandler Williams]], who caught 61 passes for a total of 870 yards. It was these defensive performances that allowed FIU to compete with the teams in Division I-A and finish the season 5â6.

FIU had found the foundation upon which the team would be built. As characteristic of FIUâs athletic department, the following year, FIU signed to play harder teams. FIU was headed in the right direction but still lacked consistency, and organization. As they began their 2006 season they almost evenly matched the teams which they played, losing almost all of their first few games by very narrow margins. [[Middle Tennessee]] 7â6, [[University of South Florida|USF]] 21â20, [[Bowling Green State University|Bowling Green]] 33-28, [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] 14â10, and [[University of North Texas]] 22â25 (7OTs).

On 14 October 2006, FIU and the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] met for the first time in what was supposed to be the beginning of an annual cross-town [[sports rivalry|rivalry game]]. Nine minutes into the second half the two teams [[Miami-FIU brawl|engaged in a brawl]] involving players from both schools, including one injured FIU player on crutches and one UM player using his helmet as a weapon. The violence later spilled into the stands, where several spectators were arrested and later released without charges. On the field, police officers were hit with bottles from the stands. 31 players were later punished for the incident, including 13 Miami players and 18 FIU players.  Two FIU players were kicked off the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2627372
|title=Miami, FIU have 31 suspended for role in brawl |date=October 16, 2006 |location=CORAL GABLES, Fla. |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FIU Duke 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|FIU Stadium during the 2011 Homecoming game versus [[Duke University]]]]

The FIU defense still finished 28th nationally, and 4th in pass defense. Antwan Barnes ranked 3rd in the nation in tackles for loss with 22 and 6 sacks. Bouie gained 119 tackles 18 for loss, and Alexander Bostic would add 98 tackles, 19 for loss and 8 sacks. Barnes, Bouie and, Bostic came to be known as the âKiller Bâsâ. On offense, FIUâs receiver Chandler Williams, caught 67 passes for 664 yards.

In 2006, Barnes and Williams were both drafted to the NFL. That same year, the FIU Athletics Department hired a new athletic director [[Pete Garcia]], and found a new head coach for the team, [[Mario Cristobal]]. Cristobal became the second youngest Division I-A coach at 37. Cristobal brought in a new coaching staff in hopes to turn the program around. In 2007, FIU was the second-youngest team in Division I-A. 2/3 were underclassmen; mostly freshmen. During the 2007 season, FIU played its home games in the [[Miami Orange Bowl]] during the expansion of FIU Stadium  to 20,000 seats. The Golden Panthers concluded the season with a win against North Texas 38-19. It was the last college football game ever played at the historic Orange Bowl prior to its demolition and the last home win at that stadium (the University of Miami Hurricanes had played their last home game there several weeks prior and lost to the [[2007 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia Cavaliers]] 48-0 in the worst home shutout loss in their school's history.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/scoreboards/2007/11/10/36108_viewcast_recap.html | work=CNN | title=SI.com - News and Scores from Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the Panthers inaugurated the expanded FIU Stadium by hosting the [[South Florida Bulls]] with a crowd of over 16,000. FIU lost the game 17â9. The team would go on to win the next three games in a showing of a much improved team from the 2006 and 2007 team.

On Saturday, 27 November 2010, FIU defeated Arkansas State University to clinch the Sun Belt Conference Title. This earned FIU its first bowl berth in the short history of its football program.  Twenty-nine days later, on 26 December, they became [[Little Caesars Pizza Bowl|Little Caesars Champions]]. Fans brought signs saying, &quot;Â¡SÃ­ se puede!&quot;, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Yes we can!&quot; On 3 December 2011, FIU accepted an invitation to play in the [[2011 Beef 'O' Brady's Bowl]], the school's second consecutive bowl game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/12/26/1989534/with-this-bowl-game-no-more-f.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fiusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=205042871&amp;DB_OEM_ID=11700&lt;/ref&gt;
