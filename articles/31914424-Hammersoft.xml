'''Disney Junior''' is a 24-hour [[Australia]]n [[cable]] and [[satellite]] channel available on [[Foxtel]], [[Austar]] and [[Optus Television|Optus Television's]] subscription platforms. Since late-[[2005]], Playhouse Disney Channel was launched on [[pay television]] provider [[Foxtel]] and its affiliates in [[Australia]], but is only available on its digital service. [[SKY Network Television]] shows Playhouse Disney Channel in [[New Zealand]]. The channel is broadcast 24 hours a day, every day, showing most of the programs seen in the United States. Before Playhouse Disney Channel, Playhouse Disney was shown on [[Disney Channel (Australia)|Disney Channel Australia]] from about 9am to 3pm weekdays, and to 10am until when [[Foxtel]] came and made it to a full 24-hour channel. At 11:00 am 1 November 2007, the channel was added to [[TransACT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
