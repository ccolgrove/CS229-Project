'''''Christmas with a Capital C''''' is a 2010 [[Christian film|Christian-themed]] film directed by Helmut Schleppi.  The film's plot was based on a song of the same name by [[Contemporary_Christian_music|Christian band]] [[Go_Fish_(Christian_band)|Go Fish]], which in turn was inspired by one of actor [[Brad Stine]]'s [[stand-up comedy]] routines.  It centers around what in recent years has been dubbed the &quot;[[Christmas controversy#Present-day controversy|War on Christmas]]&quot; in the United States.

== Plot ==
[[Christmas]] has always been an exceptional time of love and tradition in the small town of Trapper Falls, [[Alaska]]. Hometown of Mayor Dan Reed ([[Ted McGinley]]) looks forward to each year with enthusiasm to all the events, friends and family that fill this special season. Together with his brother Greg ([[Brad Stine]]), they dedicate time away from their adventure tour company to drape the town is Christmas cheer. When Dan's old high school rival Mitch Bright ([[Daniel Baldwin]]) returns home after 20 years, Dan is immediately suspicious. Mitch is a highly successful big city lawyer who has never wanted anything to do with Trapper Falls. The rivalry re-ignites when Mitch takes offense to seeing the town's flagrant violation of [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|the constitution's Establishment clause]]. Mitch wants the [[Nativity scene]] removed from the front of City hall and more importantly the word Christmas switched to Happy Holidays on all signs. Fifty years of tradition are now challenged not by an outsider but a former member of the community. As the conflict escalates it goes beyond one persons opinion but magnifies into an entire town problem when Mitch enters into the mayoral race to have Dan replaced.

In the heat of the legal battle and facing certain defeat, Dan's wife Kristen ([[Nancy Stafford]]) and their daughter Makayla (Francesca Derosa) wanting to show the true meaning of Christmas are inspired to launch a &quot;Christmas with a Capital C&quot; campaign as an effort to keep the town together. In doing so they discover the secret behind Mitch's return.
