'''Kutztown University of Pennsylvania''' (commonly known as '''Kutztown University'''), is an American public [[university]] located in rural [[Kutztown, Pennsylvania|Kutztown]], [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]], [[Pennsylvania]] and is one of fourteen schools that comprise the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]] (PASSHE) and is accredited by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/InstDetail.asp | title = Institution Accreditation â Search | publisher = US Dept. of Education: Office of PostSecondary Education | accessdate = March 27, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070315220557/http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/InstDetail.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pennsylvania Department of Education]], [[NCATE]], [[National League for Nursing|NLN]], CSWE, [[National Association of Schools of Music|NASM]], and NASAD.&lt;ref name=&quot;kufacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kutztown.edu/about/fastfacts.shtml | title = Kutztown University Fast Facts | publisher = Kutztown University Website | accessdate = February 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First established in 1866, Kutztown University began as the Keystone [[Normal School]] based out of the presently-named Old Main Building and specializing in teacher education so that, in 1928, it became Kutztown State Teachers College.  Eventually, the school expanded its programs outside of education to be christened Kutztown State College in 1960 and finally Kutztown University of Pennsylvania in 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kutztown.edu/about/history.shtml | title = Kutztown University History | publisher = Kutztown University Website | accessdate = February 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between four [[undergraduate]] colleges and [[Graduate school|graduate]] studies, Kutztown University now offers programs in the [[liberal arts]] and [[sciences]], the visual and [[performing arts]], business, education, and certain graduate studies.  Eight intercollegiate men's sports and thirteen women's sports compete within the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division II and the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference ([[Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference|PSAC]]).

Recent years have seen substantial growth in the size and attendance of the university.  The academic forum building, completed in the Spring of 2007 and the recent construction of a new [[residence hall]], opened in Fall 2008, mark a major expansion project recently undertaken by the university to meet rising attendance numbers.

==History==
On September 15, 1866, the Keystone Normal School was established on what is now the site of Old Main. The needs of a burgeoning industrialization in the region placed more and more demands on teacher preparation, and in 1928, the institution was designated Kutztown State Teacher's College and authorized to confer the Bachelor's degree.

Eventually, the area's need for liberally educated personnel to staff its industries outstripped the need for teachers. In 1960, the Department of Education changed the institution's name to Kutztown State College and diversified its goals toward &quot;A center for learning for the best possible education of the youth of Pennsylvania in the arts and sciences and preparation of able and dedicated teachers.&quot;

On July 1, 1983, the institution became Kutztown University of Pennsylvania of the State System of Higher Education. The university celebrated its 125th year of service to the region and community during the 1991â92 academic year.

In 2002, [[F. Javier Cevallos]] become the 11th President of the university as well as the first Latino president in the [[Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education]].

As of Fall 2010, the University enrollment was approximately 10,700 full- and part-time undergraduate and graduate students.

===Golden Bears===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kuoriggoldenbear.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The &quot;Golden Bear&quot; mascot accompanied by four players from the 1970 football season.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hindsight Revealed.&quot; William C., editor: The Tower (Spring 2006), pg. 27. Online. &lt; http://www.kutztown.edu/tower/Tower.pdf&gt; accessed 02â27â07&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
From the mid-1930s up until 1961, Kutztown's sports teams were known as the Golden Avalanche.  In 1961, Kutztown replaced the Golden Avalanche nickname with the Golden Bears as the University's nickname.  In later years, Golden Bear mascots came into play.  Before 2005, Goldie and Griz served as the KU Golden Bear mascots.  However, they were both &quot;graduated&quot; to make way for a new mascot.  The Raymond Entertainment Group of Newark, Delaware, helped KU create the new mascot.  On October 1, 2005, at Kutztown's football game versus West Chester University, Kutztown University unveiled Avalanche as the school's new mascot.  Avalanche is so named to honor Kutztown State College during the time of the Golden Avalanche sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kutztown.edu/divisions/studentservices/departments/athletics/avalanche/histories.asp | title = Kutztown Mascot History | publisher = Kutztown University Athletic Department | accessdate = February 26, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060904011107/http://www.kutztown.edu/divisions/studentservices/departments/athletics/avalanche/histories.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Bears can be seen in more places than the sports fields.  Golden Bear statues are located within the South Dining Hall and in North Campus near the Boehm Science Building.  Along with the statues, several residential areas are named after the Golden Bear.  Golden Bear Village South behind University Place and Golden Bear Village West next to Rothermel Hall are student apartments which hold the Golden Bear moniker.
