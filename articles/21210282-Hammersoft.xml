{{1991 Big East football standings}}
The '''1991 Syracuse Orangemen football team''' represented [[Syracuse University]] in the [[1991 NCAA Division I-A football season|1991 Division I-A college football season]]. The Orangemen finished the season 10â2, winning the [[1992 Hall of Fame Bowl]].

Two new eras began for Syracuse football. It was the first season as head coach for [[Paul Pasqualoni]], who was promoted from assistant after [[Dick MacPherson]], who had led the Orangemen for the previous 11 seasons, left to take the head coaching job at the [[New England Patriots]]. More important in the long term, this was the first season in which the [[Big East Conference]] sponsored footballâalthough the conference would not establish a full round-robin schedule in the sport until the 1993 season.
