The political climate in the United States and in Arizona in particular was pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act. For example, [[Clarence Dupnik]], Pima County Sheriff, initially expressed concern that overheated political rhetoric and violence may be related, observing, &quot;When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous.&quot; He felt that Arizona had unfortunately become &quot;the capital&quot; of such feelings. &quot;We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes-20110110-spotlight&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/us/10arizona.html?_r=1&amp;src=twt&amp;twt=nytimes|title=Shooting Casts a Harsh Spotlight on Arizona's Unique Politics|first=Jennifer|last=Steinhauer|work=The New York Times|date=January 9, 2011|accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/01/sheriff-dupniks-criticism-of-p.html|title=Sheriff Dupnik's criticism of political 'vitriol' resonates with public|work=The Washington Post|author=Sandhya Somashekhar|date=January 9, 2011|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dupnik later said that he had no evidence that the alleged murders were a result of anything particular Loughner may have read or heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mirkinson|first=Jack|title=Megyn Kelly Debates Sheriff Clarence Dupnik About His Comments On Arizona Shooting (VIDEO)|work=The Huffington Post|date=January 9, 2011|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/09/megyn-kelly-debates-clarence-dupnik_n_806521.html|accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; International media had referred to the political climate in the United States and the Palin map in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12147588|title=Shot US congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords 'doing well'|publisher=BBC News (UK)|accessdate=January 11, 2011|date=January 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/artikel/210531-toestand-giffords-bevredigend.html|title=Toestand Giffords bevredigend (Condition Giffords satisfying)|work=nos.nl (Dutch public broadcaster)|accessdate=2011-01-11|language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl.nl/(/actueel/rtlnieuws/buitenland/)/components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2011/01_januari/11/buitenland/tea-party_links-misbruikt-aanslag.xml|title=Tea Party: links misbruikt aanslag (Tea Party: left misuses attack)|work=RTL News (Dutch commercial broadcaster)|accessdate=2011-01-11|language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/buitenland/1.938298|title=Amerikaans Congreslid Giffords neergeschoten (American member of congress Giffords shot down)|work=deredachtie.be (VRT; Belgian public broadcaster)|accessdate=January 11, 2011|language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/schiessereituscon110.html|title=US-Abgeordnete Giffords in kritischem Zustand (US-representative Giffords in critical condition)|work=tagesschau.de (ARD; German public broadcaster)|accessdate=January 11, 2011|language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' said that the attack seemed to confirm &quot;an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most [[radical right-wing]] opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPR-AP-2011-01-10&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=132815010|agency=Associated Press|title=Global Worry: Tucson Attack Augur More Violent US?|date=January 10, 2011|work=NPR|accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[the Netherlands]], historian Maarten van Rossem mentioned that &quot;a strong political polarization in the United States has led to a poisoned political climate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uitgesproken.vara.nl/Nieuws-detail.7674.0.html?&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=37526&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=7703&amp;cHash=b2ad592483a6ad0d1f2ea676b1f345f7|title=Politieke polarisatie in de VS (Political polarisation in the US)|work=uitgesproken.vara.nl|accessdate=January 11, 2011|language=Dutch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some media commentators, such as [[Howard Kurtz]] and [[Toby Harnden]], criticized what they perceived as a rush to judgment about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting was the result of the [[Tea Party movement]] or anything in connection to Palin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurtz2011-01-08&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;harnden&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The unseemly rush to blame Sarah Palin, the Tea Party and Republicans for murder in Arizona|author=Toby Harnden|authorlink=Toby Harnden|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyharnden/100071004/the-unseemly-rush-to-blame-sarah-palin-the-tea-party-and-republicans-for-murder-in-arizona/|accessdate=January 9, 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=January 9, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Byron York|authorlink=Byron York|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/2011/01/journalists-urged-caution-after-ft-hood-now-race-blame-palin-afte|title=Journalists urged caution after Ft.

Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the actual gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting and accusing the press of manufacturing a &quot;[[blood libel]]&quot; to blame her and the [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] for the attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_Zeleny&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/us/13palin.html|title=Palin Joins Debate on Heated Speech With Words That Stir New Controversy|first1=Jeff|last1=Zeleny|first2=Michael D.|last2=Shear|work=The New York Times|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNbloodlibel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/12/palin-says-efforts-to-lay-blame-reprehensible/#more-142708|title=Palin says efforts to lay blame 'reprehensible' and a 'blood libel'|publisher=CNN|date=|accessdate=January 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/01/11/democrats-single-sharron-angle-calling-limits-speech/|title=Palin Criticizes Manufacturers of 'Blood Libel' as Proponents of Speech Limits Cite Sharron Angle|publisher=Fox News|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=January 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday, January 16, eight days after the shooting, Vietnam War veteran James Eric Fuller, who had been shot in the knee during the Loughner attack, was arrested for disorderly conduct at a town hall meeting. After Tucson Tea Party figure Trent Humphries, who had faulted Giffords for not having enough security, stated that gun control measures should not be discussed until all those killed in the shooting were buried, Fuller allegedly took a picture of Humphries and shouted, &quot;You're dead.&quot; In an interview during the week after the shooting, Fuller had criticized Palin and what he called the &quot;Tea Party crime-syndicate&quot; for promoting a divisive political climate before the attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_Dolnick&quot;/&gt; The police then committed him to an undisclosed medical facility to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
