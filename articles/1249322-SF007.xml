'''OMAP''' developed by '''[[Texas Instruments]]''' is a category of proprietary [[system on chip]]s (SoCs) for portable and mobile [[multimedia]] [[application software|applications]]. OMAP devices generally include a general-purpose [[ARM architecture]] processor core plus one or more specialized [[co-processor]]s. Earlier OMAP variants commonly featured a variant of the [[Texas Instruments TMS320]] series [[digital signal processor]].

==OMAP family==
[[File:Galaxy Nexus smartphone.jpg|150px|thumb|The [[Galaxy Nexus]], example of smartphone with a OMAP 4460 ARM Cortex-A9]]
The OMAP family consists of three product groups classified by performance and intended application: 
* High-performance applications processors
* Basic multimedia applications processors
* Integrated modem and applications processors

Further, two main distribution channels exist, and not all parts are available in both channels.  The genesis of the OMAP product line is from partnership with cell phone vendors, and the main distribution channel involves sales directly to such ''wireless handset'' vendors.  Parts developed to suit evolving cell phone requirements are flexible and powerful enough to support sales through less specialized ''catalog'' channels; some OMAP&amp;nbsp;1 parts, and many OMAP&amp;nbsp;3 parts, have catalog versions with different sales and support models.  Parts that are obsolete from the perspective of handset vendors may still be needed to support products developed using catalog parts and distributor-based inventory management.

Recently, the catalog channels have received more focus, with OMAP35x and OMAP-L13x parts being marketed for use with various applications where capable and power-efficient processors are useful.

===High-performance applications processors===
These are parts originally intended for use as application processors in [[smartphone]]s, with processors powerful enough to run significant [[operating system]]s (such as [[Linux]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] or [[Symbian]]), support connectivity to personal computers, and support various audio and video applications.

==== OMAP 1 ====
The OMAP 1 family started with a TI-enhanced [[ARM architecture|ARM]] core, and then changed to a standard ARM926 core.  It included many variants, most easily distinguished according to manufacturing technology (130&amp;nbsp;nm except for the OMAP171x series), CPU, peripheral set, and distribution channel (direct to large handset vendors, or through catalog-based distributors).  In March 2009, the OMAP1710 family chips are still available to handset vendors.

Products using OMAP&amp;nbsp;1 processors include hundreds of cell phone models, and the [[Nokia 770]] [[Internet tablet]]s.

*OMAP171x - 220&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + [[Texas Instruments TMS320|C55x]] DSP, low-voltage 90&amp;nbsp;nm technology
*OMAP162x - 204&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + C55x DSP + 2 MB internal SRAM, 130&amp;nbsp;nm technology
*OMAP5912 - catalog availability version of OMAP1621 (or OMAP1611b in older versions)
*OMAP161x - 204&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + C55x DSP, 130&amp;nbsp;nm technology
*OMAP1510 - 168&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM925T (TI-enhanced) + C55x DSP
*OMAP5910 - catalog availability version of OMAP 1510

==== OMAP 2 ====
These parts were only marketed to handset vendors. Products using these include both Internet tablets and [[mobile phone]]s:
*OMAP2431 - 330&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM1136 + 220&amp;nbsp;MHz C64x DSP
*OMAP2430 - 330&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM1136 + 220&amp;nbsp;MHz C64x DSP + [[PowerVR]] MBX lite GPU
*OMAP2420 - 330&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM1136 + 220&amp;nbsp;MHz C55x DSP + PowerVR MBX GPU

==== OMAP 3 ====

The 3rd generation OMAP, The OMAP&amp;nbsp;3&lt;ref&gt;[http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/wtbu/wtbuproductcontent.tsp?templateId=6123&amp;navigationId=11989&amp;contentId=4682 OMAP34xx series in TI Web site]&lt;/ref&gt; is broken into 3 distinct groups: the OMAP34x, the OMAP35x, and the OMAP36x. OMAP34x and OMAP36x are distributed directly to large handset (such as cell phone) manufacturers.  OMAP35x is a variant of OMAP34x intended for catalog distribution channels.  The OMAP36x is a 45&amp;nbsp;nm version of the 65&amp;nbsp;nm OMAP34x with higher clock speed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS8848023892.html OMAP36x]&lt;/ref&gt;

The video technology in the higher end OMAP&amp;nbsp;3 parts is derived in part from the [[Texas Instruments DaVinci|DaVinci]] product line, which first packaged higher end C64x+ DSPs and image processing controllers with ARM9 processors last seen in the older OMAP&amp;nbsp;1 generation or ARM Cortex-A8&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ti.com/product/dm3730&lt;/ref&gt;.

Not highlighted in the list below is that each OMAP&amp;nbsp;3 SoC has an &quot;Image, Video, Audio&quot; (IVA2) accelerator.  These units do not all have the same capabilities.  Most devices support 12 megapixel camera images, though some support 5 or 3 megapixels.  Some support HD imaging.

===Basic multimedia applications processors===

These are marketed only to handset manufacturers. They are intended to be highly integrated, low cost chips for consumer products. The OMAP-DM series are intended to be used as digital media coprocessors for mobile devices with high megapixel digital still and video cameras.

*OMAP331 - [[ARM architecture|ARM9]]
*OMAP310 - ARM9
*OMAP-DM270 - ARM7 + [[Texas Instruments TMS320|C54x]] DSP
*OMAP-DM299 - ARM7 + ISP + stacked mDDR SDRAM
*OMAP-DM500 - ARM7 + ISP + stacked mDDR SDRAM
*OMAP-DM510 - ARM926 + ISP + 128 MB stacked mDDR SDRAM
*OMAP-DM515 - ARM926 + ISP + 256 MB stacked mDDR SDRAM
*OMAP-DM525 - ARM926 + ISP + 256 MB stacked mDDR SDRAM

===Integrated modem and applications processors===
[[File:OMAP-850.jpg|thumb|150px|right|An OMAP 850 in a [[HTC Wizard]]]]
These are marketed only to handset manufacturers.  Many of the newer versions are highly integrated for use in very low cost cell phones.

*OMAPV1035 - single-chip EDGE (was discontinued in 2009 as TI announced baseband chipset market withdrawal).
*OMAPV1030 - EDGE digital baseband
*OMAP850 - 200&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + GSM/GPRS digital baseband + stacked EDGE co-processor
*OMAP750 - 200&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + GSM/GPRS digital baseband + DDR Memory support
*OMAP733 - 200&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + GSM/GPRS digital baseband + stacked SDRAM
*OMAP730 - 200&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + GSM/GPRS digital baseband + SDRAM Memory support
*OMAP710 - 133&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM925 + GSM/GPRS digital baseband

===OMAP L-1x===

The OMAP L-1x parts are marketed only through catalog channels, and have a different technological heritage than the other OMAP parts.  Rather than deriving directly from cell phone product lines, they grew from the video-oriented [[Texas Instruments DaVinci|DaVinci]] product line by removing the video-specific features while using upgraded DaVinci peripherals.  A notable feature is use of a ''floating point'' DSP, instead of the more customary fixed point one.

The [[Hawkboard]] uses the OMAP-L138

*OMAP-L137 - 300&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + C674x floating point DSP
*OMAP-L138 - 300&amp;nbsp;MHz ARM926EJ-S + C674x floating point DSP

==Products using OMAP processors==
Many [[mobile phone]]s use OMAP SoCs, including the [[Nokia]] N90, N91, N92, N95, N82, E61, E62, E63, E90, N800, N810 and [[N900]] [[Internet tablet]]s, [[Motorola Droid]],  [[Motorola Droid X|Droid X]], and [[Motorola Droid 2|Droid 2]]. The [[Palm Pre]], [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]], [[Touch Book]] also use an OMAP SoC (the OMAP3430). Others to use an OMAP [[system-on-a-chip|SoC]] include the Sony Ericsson Satio, the Sony Ericsson Vivaz, the Samsung [[Omnia HD]], [[Sony Ericsson Idou]], the [[Nook Color]], [[Kindle Fire]], and some [[Archos]] tablets (such as Archos 80 gen 9 and Archos 101 gen 9).

OMAP SoCs are also used as the basis for a number of hobbyist and prototyping boards, such as the [[Beagle Board]] and [[Panda Board]].
