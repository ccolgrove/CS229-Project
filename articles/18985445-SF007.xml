[[Image:GParted.png|thumb|300px|[[GParted]] is a popular partition editor]]
A '''partition editor''' (also called '''partitioner''' or '''partitioning utility''') is a kind of [[utility software]] designed to view, create, alter and delete [[Partition (computing)|disk partitions]] on a computer storage device, most commonly a [[hard disk]], but often a [[USB flash drive]] or other storage medium.

A ''partition'' is a section or segment of the storage space on a storage device. By partitioning a large device into several partitions it is possible to isolate various types of data from one another, and allow the coexistence of two or more operating systems simultaneously.

A drive can be partitioned into multiple partitions, or have many combined into one. Partition editing programs can be used to shrink a single partition to make room for more or combine two to increase the space on one.
