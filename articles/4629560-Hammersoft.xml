'''Lee Anthony Humphrey''' (born April 23, 1984) is an American professional [[basketball]] player who is currently a [[shooting guard]] for [[Ratiopharm Ulm]] in the German basketball league [[Basketball Bundesliga]].  Humphrey played [[college basketball]] for the [[University of Florida]], and was a key member of the [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida Gators]] teams that won back-to-back [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA National Championship]]s in [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006]] and [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007]].  He set both the season and career records at Florida for three-point field goals, making 113 in back-to-back seasons and 288 in his college career.

==Early years==

Humphrey was born in [[Maryville, Tennessee]] in 1984.  He attended [[Maryville High School (Tennessee)|Maryville High School]], where he played [[high school basketball]] for the Maryville Red Rebels.  As a senior, he was named Tennessee's Class AAA [[Tennessee Mr. Basketball Award|Mr. Basketball]] for the 2002&amp;ndash;2003 season after averaging 21.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists.  He graduated from high school in 2003.

==College career==

Humphrey received an [[athletic scholarship]] to attend the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], and he played for coach [[Billy Donovan]]'s [[Florida Gators men's basketball]] team from 2003 to 2007.  He emerged as a prolific weapon from outside the arc during the 2005-2006 season in which he hit several clutch three-pointers, including three in the Final Four against George Mason and the championship game against UCLA.  The 73-57 win over UCLA was the clincher of Florida's first national basketball championship.  The Gators finished the season with a 33-6 mark.

Humphrey's dominance continued during the 2006-2007 campaign and with the other members of the starting five returning, the Gators rolled to a 35-5 record.  On March 23, 2007 in the St. Louis regional NCAA tournament game against the [[Oregon Ducks]], the game was delayed 10 minutes after a three-point shot Humphrey made damaged the net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Long, Mark| title=Humphrey, Green destroy Ducks| publisher=Associated Press| url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2007/mar/26/humphrey_green_destroy_ducks/?sports| date=2007-03-26| accessdate=2007-04-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930185516/http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2007/mar/26/humphrey_green_destroy_ducks/?sports &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2007 [[Final Four]], he hit four three point shots in his team's 76-66 victory against [[UCLA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Pells, Eddie| title=UCLA Bruins/Florida Gators Recap, March 31, 2007| publisher=Associated Press| url=http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/recap?gid=200703310210&amp;prov=ap| date=2007-03-31| accessdate=2007-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in becoming the record holder for most three pointers made during the NCAA tournament, surpassing former Duke star [[Bobby Hurley]]. On April 2, 2007 he won a second [[NCAA basketball]] championship with the [[Florida Gators]], scoring 14 points in an 84-75 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Pells, Eddie| title=NCAA Basketball Ohio State Buckeyes/Florida Gators Recap April 2, 2007 Yahoo!

Humphrey was also a proven academic success, becoming just the second Gators basketball player to be named a first team Academic All-American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Dow named First Team academic All-American| publisher=Ivy League Sports| url=http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/article.asp?intID=5798| date=2007-02-28| accessdate=2007-04-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930014539/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/article.asp?intID=5798 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey also served as the President of the [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes]] Chapter at the University of Florida. On August 11, 2007 he received his Bachelor of Science in Applied Physiology and Kinesiology.

==Professional career==
On June 30, 2007, Humphrey accepted an offer from the Washington Wizards to participate in their summer league but was cut.  He then crossed the Atlantic, signing on with PAOK, one of Greece's best-known club teams. When the team signed a third American player, Humphrey was cut due to league rules that limit team rosters to two American players. He spent the second half of the 2007-2008 season in Poland playing for Energa Czarni, but saw limited minutes. In July 2008, Humphrey signed a one year contract with [[Ratiopharm Ulm]], a south German team playing in the [[Basketball Bundesliga]] (first German division).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szon.de/news/sport/basketball/200807040816.html Ulm picks college ace Humphrey]&lt;/ref&gt;
