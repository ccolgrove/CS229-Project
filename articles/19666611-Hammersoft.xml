The '''War in Afghanistan''' began on October 7, 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/07/politics.september11 |title=After the September Eleventh Terrorist attacks on America,&quot;It's time for war, Bush and Blair tell Taliban â We're ready to go in â PM&amp;#124;Planes shot at over Kabul&quot; |publisher=Guardian News and Media'' |date= October 7, 2001|accessdate=2011-08-02 |location=London |first1=Ed |last1=Vulliamy |first2=Patrick |last2=Wintour |first3=Ian |last3=Traynor |first4=Kamal |last4=Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the armed forces of the [[United States|United States of America]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and the Afghan [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Front]] (Northern Alliance) launched [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. The primary driver of the invasion was the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, with the stated goal of dismantling the [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorist organization and ending its use of Afghanistan as a base. The United States also said that it would remove the [[Taliban]] [[Taliban regime|regime]] from power and create a viable democratic state. A decade into the war, the U.S. continues to battle a widespread [[Taliban insurgency]], and the war has expanded into the [[War in North-West Pakistan|tribal areas of neighboring Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Varun Vira and Anthony Cordesman [http://www.scribd.com/doc/70694522/Pakistan-Violence-Versus-Stability &quot;Pakistan: Violence versus Stability: A Net Assessment.&quot;] ''[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]],'' 25 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The preludes to the war were the assassination of anti-Taliban leader [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] on September 9, 2001, and the September 11 attacks on the United States, in which nearly 3000 civilians lost their lives in New York City, [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]]. and Pennsylvania. The United States identified members of al-Qaeda, an organization based in, operating out of and allied with the Taliban's [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]], as the perpetrators of the attacks.

In the first phase of Operation Enduring Freedom, ground forces of the Afghan United Front working with U.S. and British Special Forces and with massive U.S. air support, ousted the Taliban regime from power in Kabul and most of Afghanistan in a matter of weeks. Most of the senior Taliban leadership fled to neighboring Pakistan. The democratic [[Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] was established and an interim government under [[Hamid Karzai]] was created which was also democratically elected by the Afghan people in the 2004 general elections. The [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) was established by the [[UN Security Council]] at the end of December 2001 to secure [[Kabul]] and the surrounding areas. [[NATO]] assumed control of ISAF in 2003. ISAF includes troops from 42 countries, with NATO members providing the core of the force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/world/asia/23afghan.htm NATO Chief Promises to Stand by Afghanistan] New York Times, 22 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the invasion was to find [[Osama bin Laden]] and other high-ranking Al-Qaeda members to be put on trial, to destroy the organization of Al-Qaeda, and to remove the Taliban regime which supported and gave safe harbor to it. The [[George W. Bush administration]] stated that, [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|as policy]], it would not distinguish between [[terrorist]] organizations and nations or governments that harbored them.

The Afghan nation was able to build democratic structures and to create some progress in key areas such as health, economy, education, transport, agriculture and construction.

==Historic background (1992â2001)==
===Internal divisions following Najibullah and foreign involvement===
{{Main|Soviet war in Afghanistan|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989â1992)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992â1996)}}

After the fall of the [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]]-regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The Peshawar Accords created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an [[interim government]] for a transitional period. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:
{{quote|The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the [[Soviet]]-backed Najibullah government. ... With the exception of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's [[Hezb-e Islami]], all of the parties ... were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992. ... Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and Kabul generally. ... Shells and rockets fell everywhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt; |[[Human Rights Watch]]|2005}}

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan expert [[Amin Saikal]] concludes in ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'':

{{quote|Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in [[Central Asia]]. ... [[Islamabad]] could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders ... to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions. ... Had it not been for the ISI's logistic support and supply of a large number of rockets, Hekmatyar's forces would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; |[[Amin Saikal]] in &quot;Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival&quot;|2004}}

In addition, Saudi Arabia and Iran - as competitors for regional [[hegemony]] - supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Amin Saikal | authorlink = Amin Saikal| title =Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival|edition=2006 1st |page=352| publisher = I.B.

Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. The United States and European countries after the communist defeat largely lost interest in Afghanistan and disengaged. U.S. congressman Dana Rohrabacher told U.S. Congress in 2004:
{{quote|[I]t was a policy decision to walk away... even after psychopathic killers like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar rose up as the Soviets departed....

Southern Afghanistan was under the control of neither foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. In 1994, the Taliban (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the tyranny of the local governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994â1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp.25â6&lt;/ref&gt; Mullah Omar started his movement with fewer than 50 armed [[madrassah]] students in his hometown of Kandahar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;/&gt; When the Taliban took control of the city in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (5)&quot;/&gt; In 1994, the Taliban took power in several provinces in southern and central Afghanistan.

In late 1994, most of the militia factions (Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's [[Secretary of Defense]] Ahmad Shah Massoud.

Under the Taliban, Al-Qaeda was able to use Afghanistan as a place to train and indoctrinate fighters, import weapons, coordinate with other jihadists, and plot terrorist actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf 9/11 Commission Report] P. 66&lt;/ref&gt; While Al-Qaeda maintained its own [[Afghan training camp|establishments in Afghanistan]], it also supported training camps belonging to other organizations. Between 10,000 and 20,000 people passed through these facilities before 9/11, most of whom were sent to fight for the Taliban against the United Front but a smaller number were inducted into al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf 9/11 Commission Report] P. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

After the August 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings were linked to bin Laden, President [[Bill Clinton]] ordered [[Operation Infinite Reach#Attack on camps in Afghanistan|missile strikes on militant training camps]] in Afghanistan. U.S. officials pressed the Taliban to surrender bin Laden, and the international community imposed sanctions on the Taliban in 1999, calling for bin Laden to be surrendered. The Taliban repeatedly rebuffed the demands, however.

[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) [[Special Activities Division]] paramilitary teams were active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama Bin Laden. These teams planned several operations but did not receive the order to execute from President Clinton.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Coll, Steve (2004).

Ahmad Shah Massoud meanwhile remained the only leader of the United Front in Afghanistan. In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the [[Women's Rights]] Declaration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{Cite book| last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = Marcela Grad| title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |page=310 | publisher = Webster University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of Massoud for the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch&quot;/&gt; As a consequence many civilians fled to the area of Ahmad Shah Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2007|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpQI6HKV-ZY&amp;feature=related |title = Inside the Taliban| publisher = [[National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |url =http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274/Overview|title =Inside the Taliban | publisher = [[National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, estimates range up to one million people fleeing the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Geographic]] concluded in its documentary ''&quot;Inside the Taliban&quot;'':
{{quote|The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is Ahmad Shah Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt; |[[National Geographic]]|Inside the Taliban}}

In early 2001 Massoud addressed the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] asking the [[international community]] to provide [[humanitarian]] help to the people of Afghanistan.([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 see video])&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;/&gt; He stated that the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had introduced &quot;a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]&quot; and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;/&gt; On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency (2001) report http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/tal32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Change in U.S. policy towards Afghanistan===
During the [[Clinton administration]] the U.S. had no clear policy towards Afghanistan although it slightly favoured Pakistan's approach. In 1997, U.S. State Department's [[Robin Raphel]] told anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud to surrender to the Taliban. Massoud answered that as long as he controlled an area the size of his hat he would continue to defend it from the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;
Robin Raphel eventually became a lobbyist and adviser at Cassidy &amp; Associates.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Law Journal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2010|url =http://www.law.com//law/international/LawArticleIntl.?id=1202439488447 |title = Despite Obama Ban, Official's Lobbyist Past No Obstacle| publisher = [[The National Law Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm had a $1.2 million contract with the Musharraf military regime of Pakistan. At Cassidy &amp; Associates she lobbied and advised Congress and the State Department for Pakistan on issues such as Afghan policy, Pakistan's relations with India, judicial independence and U.S. perceptions and congressional views of the Pakistan government.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Law Journal&quot;/&gt; In late 2009 Raphel was (again) appointed to the [[Af-Pak]] region as deputy to [[Richard Holbrooke]], the late US. Special Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, by the Obama administration. Raphel will be the main person overlooking the $1.5 billion U.S. aid package &quot;for non-military purpose&quot; to Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Law Journal&quot;/&gt;

At one point in the war, in 1997, the Taliban were vulnerable and the road to the capital, Kabul, was wide open. Two top foreign policy officials in the Clinton administration flew to northern Afghanistan to convince - without success - the United Front not to take advantage of an opportunity to make crucial gains against the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; Before the United Front could strike, Assistant Secretary of State Rick Indefurth and American U.N. Ambassador [[Bill Richardson]] flew to northern Afghanistan and tried to convince the leadership of the United Front that this was not the time for an offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; Instead, they insisted this was the time for a cease-fire and an arms embargo. At the same time Pakistanis began a &quot;Berlin-like airlift to resupply and re-equip the Taliban&quot;, financed with Saudi money.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt;

[[File:US-DefenseIntelligenceAgency-Seal.svg|thumb|145px|An analyst of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] was fired by her leading officer for talking to Massoud.]]
On another note, an analyst with the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), Julie Sirrs, had visited Afghanistan, but only in those areas controlled by the Taliban. After returning, she had realized that this was a one-dimensional view of Afghanistan and there were holes in the DOD's understanding of the situation. In 1998, she requested to officially go back to northern Afghanistan to the areas controlled by Commander Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; Subsequently she was denied the permission to go there.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; So she went to the Panjshir Valley on her vacation and paid the journey on herself (in 1998). U.S. congressman Dana Rohrabacher describes:

{{quote|When she got to the [[Panjshir Valley]], she found... something vital to America's security was happening, something she was not really able to discover when she visited the Taliban-controlled areas before. Commander Massoud told her that he was facing a new enemy in Afghanistan [meaning foreign esp. Arab forces].... Apparently, bin Laden, who was making Afghanistan into his base of operations, was importing Islamic radicals from all over the world, training them as terrorists and killers and then sending them up against Massoud's troops.... She only had a short time, but she collected enough information for a preliminary report, and she headed home. The minute she got back, she found herself under severe restrictions at the Defense Intelligence Agency and restricted to whom she could brief or show any of her reports.... The commanding officer of the DIA labeled her as insubordinate, he fired her; and when she fought her dismissal, he set out to destroy her. Amidst the fight to save her job, the DIA commanding officer told her what really upset him most was her contact with Massoud, who, according to the DIA general, was one of the bad guys. This general was sending his people to be briefed by the Taliban, but any contact with Massoud was a cause for dismissal.... It was a mind set of the man who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency. Something is terribly wrong with this picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; |U.S. Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]]|2004}}

[[File:2430 E Street.png|thumb|CIA officers on the ground lobbied for a change in U.S. policy towards [[Afghanistan]].]]
In the meantime, the only collaboration between Massoud and another U.S. intelligence service, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), consisted of an effort to trace Osama bin Laden following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;&gt;Risen, James. &quot;State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration&quot;, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. and the European Union provided no support to Massoud for the fight against the Taliban.

A change of policy regarding support to Massoud, lobbied for by CIA officers who had visited Massoud, was underway during 2001. According to Steve Coll's book &quot;Ghost Wars&quot; (who won the 2005 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for General Non-Fiction):&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Steve Coll| authorlink = Steve Coll| title =Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |edition=February 23, 2004 |page=720| publisher =Penguin Press HC | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The CIA officers admired Massoud greatly. They saw him as a [[Che Guevara]] figure, a great actor on historyâs stage. Massoud was a poet, a military genius, a religious man, and a leader of enormous courage who defied death and accepted its inevitability, they thought.... In his house there were thousands of books: Persian poetry, histories of the Afghan war in multiple languages, biographies of other military and guerilla leaders. In their meetings Massoud wove sophisticated, measured references to Afghan history and global politics into his arguments. He was quiet, forceful, reserved, and full of dignity, but also light in spirit. The CIA team had gone into the Panshjir as unabashed admirers of Massoud. Now their convictions deepened.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt; |[[Steve Coll]] in &quot;[[Ghost Wars]]&quot;|2004}}

U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher also recalls:

{{quote|[B]etween Bush's inauguration and 9/11, I met with the new national security staff on 3 occasions, including one meeting with Condoleezza Rice to discuss Afghanistan. There were, in fact, signs noted in an overview story in The Washington Post about a month ago that some steps were being made to break away from the previous administration's Afghan policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher&quot;/&gt; |U.S. Congressman [[Dana Rohrabacher]]|2004}}

CIA lawyers, working with officers in the Near East Division and Counterterrorist Center, began to draft a formal, legal presidential finding for Bushâs signature authorizing a new covert action program in Afghanistan, the first in a decade that sought to influence the course of the Afghan war in favour of Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt; [[Richard A. Clarke]], chair of the Counter-Terrorism Security Group under the Clinton administration, and later an official in the Bush administration, allegedly presented a plan to incoming Bush administration official [[Condoleezza Rice]] in January 2001.

A change in policy was finalized in August 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;/&gt; In late August 2001, the Bush administration, to pressure the Taliban to hand over leading Al-Qaeda operatives, agreed on a plan to start giving support to the anti-Taliban forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud who sought to create a democratic form of government in Afghanistan. Massoud until then had not received any meaningful support from Western countries. In a meeting by the Bush administration's top national security officials it was agreed that the Taliban in negotiations would be presented with a final ultimatum to hand over Osama bin Laden and other leading Al-Qaeda operatives. If the Taliban refused, [[covert]] military aid would be channeled by the U.S. to anti-Taliban groups. If both those options failed, &quot;the deputies agreed that the United States would seek to overthrow the Taliban regime through more direct action.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/mar/24/september11.usa2 |author=Julian Borger |title=Bush team 'agreed plan to attack the Taliban the day before September 11' |publisher=The Guardian |date=24 March 2004|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 9, 2001===
[[File:Massoud 2000.jpg|thumb|left|250px|In spring 2001 the anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud stated that the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had introduced &quot;a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]&quot; and warned about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.]]
On his visit to Europe in March 2001 Ahmad Shah Massoud had warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.

On September 9, 2001, Massoud, then aged 48, was the target of a [[suicide attack]] by two Arabs posing as journalists detonating a bomb hidden in their video camera during an interview in Khoja Bahauddin, in the [[Takhar Province]] of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/10/world/taliban-foe-hurt-and-aide-killed-by-bomb.html |title=Taliban Foe Hurt and Aide Killed by Bomb |location=Afghanistan |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=September 10, 2001 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burns |first=John F. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/09/world/threats-responses-assassination-afghans-too-mark-day-disaster-hero-was-lost.html |title=THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASSASSINATION; Afghans, Too, Mark a Day of Disaster: A Hero Was Lost |location=Afghanistan |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=September 9, 2002 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud died in a helicopter taking him to a hospital. The funeral, though in a rather rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning Afghans. ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq-zqA1DMWs see video])

Massoud had survived countless assassination attempts over a period of 26 years. The assassination of Massoud is considered to have a strong connection to the September 11, 2001 attacks, which killed nearly 3,000 people, and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier. International experts and members of the United Front such as [[Amrullah Saleh]] feared that without Massoud the anti-Taliban resistance would be overrun by the Taliban.

[[John P. O'Neill]] was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the [[FBI]] until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the [[World Trade Center]] (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, OâNeill told two of his friends:

{{quote|We're due. And we're due for something big.... Some things have happened in Afghanistan [referring to the assassination of Massoud].

On September 11, 2001, in the early morning, a series of coordinated attacks took place on United States soil. Four commercial passenger jet airliners were hijacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Holmes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|first=Stephen|title=Making sense of suicide missions|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-929797-9|editor=Diego Gambetta|chapter=Al Qaeda, September 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keppel2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Keppel|first=Gilles|title=Al Qaeda in its own words|year=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02804-3|coauthors=Milelli, Jean-Pierre and Ghazaleh, Pascale}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hijackers intentionally crashed two of the airliners into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in [[New York City]], killing everyone on board and many others working in the buildings. Both buildings collapsed within two hours, destroying nearby buildings and damaging others. The hijackers crashed a third airliner into the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania|Shanksville]] in rural Pennsylvania after some of its passengers and flight crew attempted to retake control of the plane, which the hijackers had redirected toward Washington, D.C to target the [[White House]], or the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]]. There were no survivors from any of the flights.

Nearly 3,000 people and the 19 hijackers died in the attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOX Responders&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=FOX News|title=9 Years Later, Nearly 900 9/11 Responders Have Died, Survivors Fight for Compensation|date=September 11, 2010|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/09/report-responders-died-ground-zero-illnesses/|accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New York State Health Department, 836 responders, including firefighters and police personnel, have died as of June 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOX Responders&quot;/&gt;

The United States identified members of the Al-Qaeda movement based in Afghanistan as the perpetrators of the attacks.

==Legal basis for war==
The [[United Nations Charter]], to which all the Coalition countries are signatories, provides that all UN member states must settle their international disputes peacefully and no member nation can use military force except in self-defense. The [[United States Constitution]] states that international treaties, such as the United Nations Charter, that are ratified by the U.S. are part of the law of the land in the U.S., though subject to effective repeal by any subsequent act of Congress (i.e., the &quot;leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant&quot; or &quot;last in time&quot; canon of statutory interpretation)&lt;ref name=&quot;jurist.law.pit.edu&quot;&gt;Jurist, 6 Nov. 2001, &quot;Bombing of Afghanistan Is Illegal and Must Be Stopped,&quot; by Professor Marjorie Cohn, http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/forumnew36.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) did not authorize the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan ([[Operation Enduring Freedom]]).

Defenders of the legitimacy of the U.S.-led invasion argue that U.N. Security Council authorization was not required since the invasion was an act of collective self-defense provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter, and therefore was not a [[war of aggression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jurist.law.pit.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://austlii.org/au/journals/MelbJIL/2003/3.html|title=Security Council Resolutions 1368 (2001) and 1373 (2001): What They Say and What They Do Not Say, European Journal of International Law}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics maintain that the bombing and invasion of Afghanistan were not legitimate self-defense under Article 51 of the UN Charter because the 9/11 attacks were not âarmed attacksâ by another state, but rather were perpetrated by groups of individuals or non-state actors, and that these attackers had no proven connection to Afghanistan. Further, it is their opinion that even if a state had perpetrated the 9/11 attacks, no bombing campaign would constitute self-defense; the necessity for self-defense must be âinstant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation.â.&lt;ref&gt;Jurist, 6 Nov. 2001, &quot;Bombing of Afghanistan Is Illegal and Must Be Stopped,&quot; by Professor Marjorie Cohn, http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forum/forumnew36.htm , citing Caroline Case, 29 BFSP 1137-8; 30 BFSP 19-6 (1837)&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[George W. Bush]] was authorized by Congress on September 14, 2001, by legislation titled [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] which was passed and signed on September 18, 2001 by both President Bush and congress. This legislation authorized the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the attacks on September 11, 2001. The authorization granted the President the authority to use all &quot;necessary and appropriate force&quot; against those whom he determined &quot;planned, authorized, committed or aided&quot; the September 11th attacks, or who harbored said persons or groups. The Bush administration, for its part, did not seek a declaration of war by the U.S. Senate, and labeled Taliban troops as supporters of terrorists rather than soldiers, denying them the protections of the [[Geneva Convention]] and [[due process]] of law.

==2001: Initial attack==
{{See|2001 in Afghanistan}}

On 5 October, 2001, the Taliban offered to try Bin Laden in an Afghan court, so long as the United States provided what it called &quot;solid evidence&quot; of his guilt, but the U.S. would not hand over its evidence to the Taliban [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/05/afghanistan.terrorism]. So on October 7, 2001, the U.S. government launched military operations in Afghanistan. Teams from the CIA's Special Activities Division (SAD) were the first U.S. forces to enter Afghanistan and begin combat operations. They were soon joined by [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] from the 5th Special Forces Group and other units from [[USSOCOM]].&lt;ref&gt;First In: An insiders account of how the CIA spearheaded the War on Terror in Afghanistan by Gary Schroen, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jawbreaker: The Attack on Bin Laden and AL Qaeda: A personal account by the CIA's field Commander by Gary Berntsen and Ralph Pezzulla, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ghostwars&quot;&gt;Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001, by Steve Coll, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2001, airstrikes were reported in the capital, Kabul (where electricity supplies were severed), at the airport, at [[Kandahar]] (home of the Taliban's Supreme Leader Mullah Omar), and in the city of [[Jalalabad, Afghanistan|Jalalabad]]. [[CNN]] released exclusive footage of Kabul being bombed to all the American broadcasters at approximately 5:08 p.m. October 7, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;archives_cnn_com9&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/ret.attack.pentagon/|title = archives.cnn.com|accessdate = September 27, 2007|work=CNN|date=October 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:US Special Forces on horseback, Afghanistan, 2001.jpg|thumb|[[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Special Forces]] with Northern Alliance troops on horseback]]
At 17:00 UTC, President Bush confirmed the strikes on national television and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Tony Blair]] also addressed the UK. Bush stated that Taliban military sites and terrorist training grounds would be targeted. In addition, food, medicine, and supplies would be dropped to &quot;the starving and suffering men, women and children of Afghanistan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;www_australianpolitics_com8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2001/01-10-07.shtml|title = australianpolitics.com|accessdate = September 27, 2007|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prerecorded videotape of Osama bin Laden had been released before the attacks in which he condemned any attacks against Afghanistan. [[Al Jazeera]], the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] satellite news channel, reported that these tapes were received shortly before the attack.

British and American special forces worked jointly to [[2001 uprising in Herat|liberate Herat]] in November 2001. These forces worked with Afghan opposition groups on the ground, in particular the Northern Alliance. The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia also deployed forces and several other countries provided basing, access and overflight permission.

The US was able to track Al-Qaeda's number three at the time [[Mohammed Atef]] who was one of the most wanted, when Atef was killed, along with his guard Abu Ali al-Yafi'i and six others,&lt;ref name=&quot;wnc&quot;&gt;[[World News Connection]], [http://www.why-war.com/news/2003/10/29/alqaidam.html Al-Qa'ida member recalls US bombardment, accuses Taliban of betrayal], October 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/special/terror/front/1136330.html Taliban confirms death of Osama bin Laden's military chief in US strike], November 17, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; in a U.S. air-strike on his home near Kabul during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan at some time between November 14â16, 2001. This was one of America's first and largest victories during the early stages of the war.

===Air campaigns===
Bombers operating at high altitudes well out of range of [[antiaircraft]] guns dropped bombs at Afghan training camps and Taliban air defenses. U.S. aircraft, including [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|Apache]] [[helicopter gunship]]s from the [[101st Combat Aviation Brigade]], operated with impunity throughout the campaign with no losses due to Taliban air defenses.

The strikes initially focused on the area in and around the cities of Kabul, Jalalabad, and Kandahar. Within a few days, most Taliban training sites were severely damaged and the Taliban's air defenses were destroyed. The campaign then focused on [[Command, control, and communications|command, control, and communication]] targets which weakened the ability of the Taliban forces to communicate. However, the line facing the Afghan Northern Alliance held, and no tangible battlefield successes had yet occurred on that front. Two weeks into the campaign, the Northern Alliance demanded the air campaign focus more on the front lines.
[[File:PsyOps Pamphlet dropped over Mazar i Sharif.PNG|thumb|Example of the U.S. propaganda pamphlets dropped over [[Mazari Sharif]].]]

The next stage of the campaign began with carrier based [[F/A-18 Hornet]] [[fighter-bomber]]s hitting Taliban vehicles in pinpoint strikes, while other U.S. planes began [[cluster bomb]]ing Taliban defenses. For the first time in years, Northern Alliance commanders finally began to see the substantive results that they had long hoped for on the front lines.

At the beginning of November, the Taliban front lines were bombed with [[BLU-82|daisy cutter]] bombs, and by [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130]] gunships. The Taliban fighters had no previous experience with American firepower, and often even stood on top of bare ridgelines where [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] could easily spot them and call in [[close air support]]. By November 2, Taliban frontal positions were devastated, and a Northern Alliance march on Kabul seemed possible for the first time.

Foreign fighters from al-Qaeda took over security in the Afghan cities, demonstrating the instability of the Taliban regime. Meanwhile, the Northern Alliance and their Central Intelligence Agency/Special Forces advisors planned the next stage of their offensive. Northern Alliance troops would seize [[Mazari Sharif]], thereby cutting off Taliban supply lines and enabling the flow of equipment from the countries to the north, followed by an attack on Kabul itself.

'''Areas most targeted'''

During the early months of the war the U.S. military had a limited presence on the ground. The plan was that Special Forces, and intelligence officers with a military background, would serve as liaisons with Afghan militias opposed to the Taliban, would advance after the cohesiveness of the Taliban forces was disrupted by American air power.&lt;ref name=ColbyFreePress20011015&gt;

The [[Tora Bora Mountains]] lie roughly east of Afghanistan's capital Kabul, which is itself close to the border with Pakistan. American intelligence analysts believed that the Taliban and al Qaeda had dug in behind fortified networks of well-supplied caves and underground bunkers. The area was subjected to a heavy continuous bombardment by [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers.&lt;ref name=ColbyFreePress20011015/&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxNews20011105/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes20011028/&gt;&lt;ref name=AsiaTimes20011207&gt;

The U.S. forces and the Northern Alliance also began to diverge in their objectives. While the U.S. was continuing the search for Osama bin Laden, the Northern Alliance was pressuring for more support in their efforts to finish off the Taliban and control the country.

===Battle of Mazar-i Sharif===
{{See|Fall of Mazar-i-Sharif}}
[[File:Special Forces at the Fall of Mazar i Sharif.PNG|thumb|upright|US [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Army Special Forces]] on November 10, upon arriving into the city with [[Northern Alliance]] fighters]]
The battle for Mazari Sharif was considered important, not only because it is the home of the [[Shrine of Hazrat Ali]] or &quot;Blue Mosque&quot;, a sacred Muslim site, but also because it is the location of a significant transportation hub with two main airports and a major supply route leading into Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;[[New York Times]], [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4D61438F933A25752C1A9679C8B63&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Food The Battle for Mazar-i-Sharif], November 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It would also enable humanitarian aid to alleviate Afghanistan's looming food crisis, which had threatened more than six million people with starvation. Many of those in most urgent need lived in rural areas to the south and west of Mazar-i-Sharif.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=cbcca /&gt;
On November 9, 2001, Northern Alliance forces, under the command of generals Abdul Rashid Dostum and [[Ustad Atta Mohammed Noor]], swept across the Pul-i-Imam Bukhri bridge, meeting some resistance,&lt;ref name=&quot;gov&quot;&gt;Cahlink, George.

===Fall of Kabul===
On the night of November 12, Taliban forces fled from the city of Kabul, leaving under the cover of darkness. By the time Northern Alliance forces arrived in the afternoon of November 13, only bomb craters, burned foliage, and the burnt-out shells of Taliban gun emplacements and positions were there to greet them. A group of about twenty hardline fighters hiding in the city's park were the only remaining defenders. This Taliban group was killed in a 15-minute gun battle, being heavily outnumbered and having had little more than a telescope to shield them. After these forces were neutralized Kabul was in the hands of the U.S./NATO forces and the Northern Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbins, James. [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65669/james-dobbins/our-man-in-kabul?page=show &quot;Our Man in Kabul&quot;] ''Foreign Affairs''. November 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of Kabul marked the beginning of a collapse of Taliban positions across the map. Within 24 hours, all the Afghan provinces along the Iranian border, including the key city of [[Herat]], had fallen. Local Pashtun commanders and [[warlord]]s had taken over throughout northeastern Afghanistan, including the key city of Jalalabad. Taliban holdouts in the north, mainly [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] volunteers, fell back to the northern city of Kunduz to make a stand. By November 16, the Taliban's last stronghold in northern Afghanistan was besieged by the Northern Alliance. Nearly 10,000 Taliban fighters, led by foreign fighters, refused to [[surrender (military)|surrender]] and continued to put up resistance. By then, the Taliban had been forced back to their heartland in southeastern Afghanistan around Kandahar.&lt;ref&gt;Poolos, Alexandra. [http://insnews.org/world/focus/1101/kabul.world.reaction.report1.htm &quot;Afghanistan: Seizure of Kabul Catches World by Surprise&quot;] INS News. November 13, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 13, al-Qaeda and Taliban forces, with the possible inclusion of Osama bin Laden, had regrouped and were concentrating their forces in the Tora Bora cave complex, on the Pakistan border 50 kilometers (30&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Jalalabad, to prepare for a stand against the Northern Alliance and U.S./NATO forces. Nearly 2,000 al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters fortified themselves in positions within bunkers and caves, and by November 16, U.S. bombers began bombing the mountain fortress. Around the same time, CIA and Special Forces operatives were already at work in the area, enlisting and paying local warlords to join the fight and planning an attack on the Tora Bora complex.&lt;ref&gt;Tyrangiel, Josh.

===Fall of Kunduz===
Just as the bombardment at Tora Bora was stepped up, the siege of [[Kunduz]] that began on November 16 was continuing. Finally, after nine days of heavy fighting and American aerial bombardment, Taliban fighters surrendered to Northern Alliance forces on November 25&amp;nbsp;â November 26. Shortly before the surrender, Pakistani aircraft arrived ostensibly to evacuate a few hundred intelligence and military personnel who had been in Afghanistan before the U.S. invasion to aid the Taliban's ongoing fight against the Northern Alliance. However, during this airlift, it is alleged that up to five thousand people were evacuated from the region, including Taliban and al-Qaeda troops allied to the Pakistanis in Afghanistan, see [[Airlift of Evil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;www_newyorker_com10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.NewYorker.com/fact/content/articles/020128fa_FACT|title = New Yorker.com|accessdate = September 27, 2007|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www_msnbc_com11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msnbc.com/news/664935.asp?cp1=1|title = msnbc.com|accessdate = September 27, 2007|publisher = }}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news_bbc_co_uk12&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1677157.stm|title = Kunduz celebrates end of siege| accessdate = September 27, 2007|date=November 26, 2001|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Qala-i-Jangi===

By Sgt. [[Joseph R Chenelly]].]]
On November 25, the day that Taliban fighters holding out in Kunduz surrendered and were being herded into the [[Qala-I-Janghi]] fortress near Mazar-I-Sharif, a few Taliban attacked some Northern Alliance guards, taking their weapons and opening fire. This incident soon triggered [[Battle of Qala-i-Jangi|a widespread revolt by 300 prisoners]], who soon seized the southern half of the complex, once a medieval [[fortress]], including an armory stocked with small arms and [[crew-served weapon]]s. One American CIA paramilitary operative who had been interrogating prisoners, [[Johnny Micheal Spann]], was killed, marking the first American combat death in the war.

The revolt was finally put down after seven days of heavy fighting between an [[Special Boat Service|SBS]] unit along with some US Army Special Forces and Northern Alliance, AC-130 gunships and other aircraft took part providing strafing fire on several occasions, as well as a bombing airstrikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
A total of 86 of the Taliban prisoners survived, and around 50 Northern Alliance soldiers were killed. The squashing of the revolt marked the end of the combat in northern Afghanistan, where local Northern Alliance warlords were now firmly in control.

===Consolidation: the taking of Kandahar===
[[File:Hamid Karzai and US Special Forces.jpg|thumb|upright|Army Special Forces with [[Hamid Karzai]] in [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar province]]]]
By the end of November, Kandahar, the Taliban's birthplace, was its last remaining stronghold, and was coming under increasing pressure. Nearly 3,000 tribal fighters, led by Hamid Karzai, a loyalist of the former Afghan king, and [[Gul Agha Sherzai]], the governor of Kandahar before the Taliban seized power, pressured Taliban forces from the east and cut off the northern Taliban supply lines to Kandahar. The threat of the Northern Alliance loomed in the north and northeast.

Meanwhile, the first significant numbers of U.S. combat troops had arrived. Nearly 1,000 [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], ferried in by [[CH-53E Super Stallion]] helicopters and C-130s, set up a [[Forward Operating Base]] known as [[Camp Rhino]] in the desert south of Kandahar on November 25. This was the coalition's first strategic foothold in Afghanistan, and was the stepping stone to establishing other operating bases. The first significant combat involving U.S. ground forces occurred a day after Rhino was captured when 15 armored vehicles approached the base and were attacked by helicopter gunships, destroying many of them. Meanwhile, the airstrikes continued to pound Taliban positions inside the city, where Mullah Omar was holed up. Omar, the Taliban leader, remained defiant although his movement only controlled 4 out of the 30 Afghan provinces by the end of November and called on his forces to fight to the death.

On December 6, the U.S. government rejected any [[amnesty]] for Omar or any Taliban leaders. Shortly thereafter on December 7, Omar slipped out of the city of Kandahar with a group of his hardcore loyalists and moved northwest into the mountains of [[Uruzgan Province]], reneging on the Taliban's promise to surrender their fighters and their weapons. He was last reported seen driving off with a group of his fighters on a [[convoy]] of motorcycles.

Other members of the Taliban leadership fled into Pakistan through the remote passes of [[Paktia Province|Paktia]] and [[Paktika Province]]s. Nevertheless, Kandahar, the last Taliban-controlled city, had fallen, and the majority of the Taliban fighters had disbanded. The border town of [[Spin Boldak]] was surrendered on the same day, marking the end of Taliban control in Afghanistan. The Afghan tribal forces under Gul Agha seized the city of Kandahar while the Marines took control of the airport outside and established a U.S. base.

===Battle of Tora Bora===
{{Main|Battle of Tora Bora}}
[[File:FranksWithArmySF.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tommy Franks]] meets with Army Special Forces]]
[[File:Strikes on Tora Bora.png|thumb|right|Air strikes on Tora Bora]]
Al-Qaeda fighters were still holding out in the mountains of Tora Bora, however, while an anti-Taliban tribal militia steadily pushed bin Laden back across the difficult terrain, backed by [[Delta Force]], [[UK Special Forces]] and withering air strikes by the U.S. Facing defeat, the al-Qaeda forces agreed to a truce to give them time to surrender their weapons. In retrospect, however, many believe that the truce was a ruse to allow important al-Qaeda figures, including Osama bin Laden, to escape. On December 12, the fighting flared again, probably initiated by a rear guard buying time for the main force's escape through the White Mountains into the tribal areas of Pakistan. Again, tribal forces backed by British and U.S. special operations troops and [[air support]] pressed ahead against fortified al-Qaeda positions in caves and bunkers scattered throughout the mountainous region.

By December 17, the last cave complex had been taken and their defenders overrun. A search of the area by U.S. and UK forces continued into January, but no sign of bin Laden or the al-Qaeda leadership emerged. It is almost unanimously believed that they had already slipped away into the tribal areas of Pakistan to the south and east. It is estimated that around 200 of the al-Qaeda fighters were killed during the battle, along with an unknown number of anti-Taliban tribal fighters. No U.S. or UK deaths were reported.

===Diplomatic and humanitarian efforts===
After the Taliban fled Kabul in November 2001 and left their stronghold, the southern city of Kandahar, in December 2001, it was generally understood that by then major Al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders had fled across the border into Pakistan.

To fill the political void, in December 2001 the United Nations hosted the [[Bonn Conference]] in Germany. The meetings of various Afghan leaders here were organized by the United Nations Security Council. The Taliban were not included. Participants included representatives of four Afghan opposition groups. Observers included representatives of neighbouring and other involved major countries, including the United States.

The result was the [[Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)|Bonn Agreement]] which created the [[Afghan Interim Authority]] that would serve as the ârepository of Afghan sovereigntyâ and outlined the so-called [[Petersberg Process]], a political process towards a new constitution and choosing a new Afghan government.

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1378]] of November 14, 2001, included &quot;Condemning the Taliban for allowing Afghanistan to be used as a base for the export of terrorism by the Al-Qaeda network and other terrorist groups and for providing safe haven to Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaeda and others associated with them, and in this context supporting the efforts of the Afghan people to replace the Taliban regime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/sc7212.doc.htm |title=UN Security Council resolution 1378 (2001) |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help provide security to support this Afghan Interim Authority, the United Nations authorized an international forceâthe International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)âwith a mandate to help the Afghans maintain security in Kabul and surrounding areas.

Before the U.S.-led invasion, there were fears that the invasion and resultant disruption of services would cause widespread starvation and refugees. The United Nations [[World Food Programme]] temporarily suspended activities within Afghanistan at the beginning of the bombing attacks but resumed them after the fall of the Taliban.

Following Tora Bora, Afghan forces and their U.S. allies consolidated their position in the country. Following a [[Loya jirga]] or grand council of major Afghan factions, tribal leaders, and former exiles, an interim Afghan government was established in Kabul under Hamid Karzai. U.S. forces established their main base at [[Bagram airbase]] just north of Kabul. Kandahar airport also became an important U.S. base area. Several outposts were established in eastern provinces to hunt for Taliban and al-Qaeda fugitives. The number of U.S-led coalition troops operating in the country would eventually grow to over 10,000.
[[File:Northernalliance2002 crop.jpg|thumb|An Anti-Taliban Forces (ATF) fighter wraps a bandolier of ammunition for his 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm [[PK machine gun]] around his body as ATF personnel help secure a compound in [[Helmand Province]] in Afghanistan, January 2002.]]

Meanwhile, the Taliban and al-Qaeda had not given up. Al-Qaeda forces began regrouping in the [[Shah-i-Kot Valley|Shahi-Kot]] mountains of Paktia province throughout January and February 2002. A Taliban fugitive in Paktia province, Mullah [[Saifur Rehman]], also began reconstituting some of his militia forces in support of the anti-U.S. fighters. They totalled over 1,000 by the beginning of March 2002. The intention of the [[insurgency|insurgents]] was to use the region as a base area for launching [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla attacks]] and possibly a major offensive in the style of the [[Mujahideen]] who battled Soviet forces during the 1980s.

U.S. allied to Afghan militia intelligence sources soon picked up on this buildup in Paktia province and prepared a massive push to counter it. On March 2, 2002, U.S. and Afghan forces launched an offensive on al-Qaeda and Taliban forces entrenched in the mountains of Shahi-Kot southeast of [[Gardez]]. The Mujahideen forces, who used [[small arms]], [[rocket propelled grenade|rocket-propelled grenades]], and mortars, were entrenched into caves and bunkers in the hillsides at an altitude that was largely above 10,000&amp;nbsp;feet (3,000&amp;nbsp;m).

They used &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics, opening fire on the U.S. and Afghan forces and then retreating back into their caves and bunkers to weather the return fire and persistent U.S. bombing raids. To compound the situation for the coalition troops, U.S. commanders initially underestimated the Taliban and al-Qaeda forces as a last isolated pocket numbering fewer than 200. It turned out that the guerrillas numbered between 1,000â5,000 according to some estimates and that they were receiving [[reinforcements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Operation Anaconda costs 8 U.S. lives|publisher=CNN|date=March 4, 2002|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/03/04/ret.afghan.fighting/index.html|accessdate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 6, eight Americans and seven Afghan soldiers had been killed and reportedly 400 opposing forces had also been killed in the fighting. The coalition casualties stemmed from a [[friendly fire]] incident that killed one soldier, the downing of two helicopters by rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire that killed seven soldiers, and the pinning down of U.S. forces being inserted into what was coined as &quot;Objective Ginger&quot; that resulted in dozens of wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Operation Anaconda entering second week|publisher=CNN|date=March 8, 2002|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/08/ret.war.facts/index.html|accessdate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several hundred guerrillas escaped the dragnet heading to the [[Waziristan]] tribal areas across the border in Pakistan.

During Operation Anaconda and other missions during 2002 and 2003, special forces from several [[western nation]]s were also involved in operations. These included the [[Australian Special Air Service Regiment]], the Canadian [[Joint Task Force 2]], the German [[Kommando SpezialkrÃ¤fte|KSK]], the [[Special Air Service of New Zealand|New Zealand Special Air Service]] and Norwegian [[Marinejegerkommandoen]].

===Post-Anaconda operations===
Following the battle at Shahi-Kot, it is believed that the al-Qaeda fighters established sanctuaries among tribal protectors in Pakistan, from which they regained their strength and later began launching cross-border raids on U.S. forces by the summer months of 2002. Guerrilla units, numbering between 5 and 25 men, still regularly crossed the border from their sanctuaries in Pakistan to fire rockets at U.S. bases and ambush American convoys and patrols, as well as Afghan National Army troops, Afghan militia forces working with the U.S-led coalition, and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The area around the U.S. base at [[Shkin, Paktika|Shkin]] in Paktika province saw some of the heaviest activity.

Meanwhile, Taliban forces remained in hiding in the rural regions of the four southern provinces that formed their heartland, Kandahar, [[Zabul]], Helmand Province, and Uruzgan. In the wake of Operation Anaconda [[The Pentagon]] requested that British [[Royal Marines]] who are highly trained in [[mountain warfare]], be deployed. They conducted a number of missions over several weeks with varying results. The Taliban, who during the summer of 2002 numbered in the hundreds, avoided combat with U.S. forces and their Afghan allies and melted away into the caves and tunnels of remote Afghan mountain ranges or across the border into Pakistan during operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. remains on trail of bin Laden, Taliban leader|publisher=CNN|date=March 14, 2002|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/14/ret.osama.whereabouts/index.html|accessdate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After managing to evade U.S. forces throughout mid-2002, the remnants of the Taliban gradually began to regain their confidence and started to begin preparations to launch the insurgency that Mullah Muhammad Omar had promised during the Taliban's last days in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Asia: Afghanistan: Taliban Leader Vows Return|author=Gall, Carlotta|publisher=New York Times|date=November 13, 2004|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05E5DB173FF930A25752C1A9629C8B63|accessdate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During September, Taliban forces began a recruitment drive in Pashtun areas in both Afghanistan and Pakistan to launch a renewed &quot;[[jihad]]&quot; or holy war against the Afghan government and the U.S-led coalition. Pamphlets distributed in secret during the night also began to appear in many villages in the former Taliban heartland in southeastern Afghanistan that called for jihad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Leaflet War Rages in Afghan Countryside|agency=Associated Press|date=February 14, 2003|url=http://www.intellnet.org/news/2003/02/14/16788-1.html|accessdate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small mobile training camps were established along the border with Pakistan by al-Qaeda and Taliban fugitives to train recruits in guerrilla warfare and terrorist tactics, according to Afghan sources and a United Nations report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taliban regroups&amp;nbsp;â on the road|author=Tohid, Owias|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=June 27, 2003|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0627/p06s01-wosc.html?related |accessdate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the recruits were drawn from the [[madrassa]]s or religious schools of the tribal areas of Pakistan, from which the Taliban had originally arisen. Major bases, a few with as many as 200 men, were created in the mountainous tribal areas of Pakistan by the summer of 2003. The will of the Pakistani paramilitaries stationed at border crossings to prevent such infiltration was called into question, and Pakistani military operations proved of little use.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSMontorTalibanResurge&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= Taliban appears to be regrouped and well-funded|author=Tohid, Owias and Baldauf, Scott|publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=May 8, 2003|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0508/p01s02-wosc.html |accessdate=February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban gradually reorganized and reconstituted their forces over the winter, preparing for a summer offensive. They established a new mode of operation: gathered into groups of around 50 to launch attacks on isolated outposts and convoys of Afghan soldiers, police, or militia and then breaking up into groups of 5â10 men to evade subsequent offensives. U.S. forces in the strategy were attacked indirectly, through rocket attacks on bases and [[improvised explosive device]]s.

To coordinate the strategy, Omar named a 10-man leadership council for the resistance, with himself at the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSMontorTalibanResurge&quot; /&gt; Five operational zones were created, assigned to various Taliban commanders such as the key Taliban leader Mullah Dadullah, in charge of Zabul province operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSMontorTalibanResurge&quot; /&gt; Al-Qaeda forces in the east had a bolder strategy of concentrating on the Americans and catching them when they could with elaborate ambushes.

The first sign that Taliban forces were regrouping came on January 27, 2003, during Operation Mongoose, when a band of fighters allied with the Taliban and [[Hezb-i-Islami]] were discovered and assaulted by U.S. forces at the Adi Ghar cave complex 15&amp;nbsp;miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) north of Spin Boldak.&lt;ref name=&quot;www_globalsecurity_org1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2003/02/mil-030211-afps01.htm|title = globalsecurity.org|accessdate = September 27, 2007|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 rebels were reported killed and no U.S. casualties reported. The site was suspected to be a base to funnel supplies and fighters from Pakistan. The first isolated attacks by relatively large Taliban bands on Afghan targets also appeared around that time.

[[File:3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines - Afghanistan.jpg|3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines&amp;nbsp;â Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|[[Marine (military)|US Marines]] searching for Taliban fighters in the spring of 2005]]
As the summer continued, the attacks gradually increased in frequency in the &quot;Taliban heartland.&quot; Dozens of Afghan government soldiers, [[non-governmental organization]] and [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian workers]], and several U.S. soldiers died in the raids, ambushes, and rocket attacks. Besides using guerrilla attacks, Taliban fighters began building up their forces in the district of [[Dai Chopan]], a district in [[Zabul Province]] that also straddles Kandahar and Uruzgan and is at the very center of the Taliban heartland.

Dai Chopan district is a remote and sparsely populated corner of southeastern Afghanistan composed of towering, rocky mountains interspersed with narrow gorges. Taliban fighters decided it would be the perfect area to make a stand against the Afghan government and the coalition forces. Over the course of the summer, perhaps the largest concentration of Taliban militants gathered in the area since the fall of the regime, with up to 1,000 guerrillas regrouping. Over 220 people, including several dozen Afghan police, were killed in August 2003 as Taliban fighters gained strength.

===Coalition response===
[[File:M112 Demolition Charge.jpg|thumb|A number of 1.25lb ''M112 Demolition Charges'', consisting of a [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] compound, sit atop degraded weaponry scheduled for destruction]]
As a result, coalition forces began preparing offensives to root out the rebel forces. In late August 2005, Afghan government forces backed by U.S troops and heavy American aerial bombardment advanced upon Taliban positions within the mountain fortress. After a one-week battle, Taliban forces were routed with up to 124 fighters (according to Afghan government estimates) killed.

From January 2006, a NATO [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) started to replace the U.S. troops of Operation Enduring Freedom in southern Afghanistan. The [[British 16th Air Assault Brigade]] (later reinforced by [[Royal Marines]]) formed the core of the force in Southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British,&lt;ref name=&quot;news_bbc_co_uk2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4961368.stm|title = UK troops take over Afghan duties| accessdate = September 27, 2007|date=May 1, 2006|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2,300 Canadian,&lt;ref name=&quot;news_bbc_co_uk3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4984880.stm|title = Canada set for longer Afghan stay| accessdate = September 27, 2007|date=May 16, 2006|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,963 from the Netherlands, 300 from Australia,&lt;ref name=&quot;news_bbc_co_uk6&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4983540.stm|title = Australia outlines Afghan force| accessdate = September 27, 2007|date=May 8, 2006|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 290 from Denmark,&lt;ref name=&quot;www_centcom_mil5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.centcom.mil/sites/uscentcom1/CoalitionPages/Denmark.htm|title = centcom.mil|accessdate = September 27, 2007|publisher = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080107125509/http://www.centcom.mil/sites/uscentcom1/CoalitionPages/Denmark.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 150 from [[Estonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;www_defensenews_com7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?F=1221120&amp;C=landwar|title = defensenews.com|accessdate = September 27, 2007|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Air support was provided by U.S., British, Dutch, Norwegian and French combat aircraft and helicopters.

In January 2006, NATOâs focus in southern Afghanistan was to form [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]]s with the British leading in Helmand Province while the Netherlands and Canada would lead similar deployments in [[OrÅ«zgÄn Province]] and Kandahar Province respectively. Local Taliban figures voiced opposition to the incoming force and pledged to resist it.&lt;ref name=&quot;news_bbc_co_uk8&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5057154.stm|title = Taleban vow to defeat UK troops| accessdate = September 27, 2007|date=June 7, 2006|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern Afghanistan faced in 2006 the deadliest spate of violence in the country since the ousting of the Taliban regime by U.S.-led forces in 2001, as the newly deployed NATO troops battled resurgent militants. NATO operations have been led by British, Canadian and Dutch commanders. [[Operation Mountain Thrust]] was launched on May 17, 2006, with the purpose of rooting out Taliban forces. In July, Canadian Forces, supported by U.S., British, Dutch and Danish forces, launched [[Operation Medusa]] in an attempt to clear the areas of Taliban fighters.

Further NATO operations included the [[Battle of Panjwaii]], [[Operation Mountain Fury]] and [[Operation Falcon Summit]]. The fighting for NATO forces was intense throughout the second half of 2006. NATO has been successful in achieving tactical victories over the Taliban and denied areas to them, but the Taliban were not completely defeated, and NATO had to continue operations into 2007.

On May 12, 2007, ISAF forces killed [[Mullah Dadullah]], a Taliban commander in charge of leading operations in the south of the country; eleven other Taliban fighters were killed in the same firefight.

During the summer, NATO forces achieved tactical victories over the Taliban at the [[Battle of Chora]] in [[OrÅ«zgÄn Province]], where Dutch and Australian ISAF forces are deployed.

On August 16, 2007, eight civilians including a pregnant women and a baby died when [[Nangar Khel incident|Polish soldiers shelled the village of Nangar Khel]], Paktika Province. Seven soldiers have been charged with [[war crimes]].

This was said to have stopped a potential Taliban offensive on Kandahar.

The strength of Taliban forces was estimated by Western officials and analysts at about 10,000 fighters fielded at any given time, according to an October 30 report in ''[[The New York Times]]''. Of that number, &quot;only 2,000 to 3,000 are highly motivated, full-time insurgents&quot;, the ''Times'' reported. The rest are part-timers, made up of alienated, young Afghan men angry at bombing raids or fighting to get money. In 2007, more foreign fighters were showing up in Afghanistan than ever before, according to Afghan and United States officials. Approximately 100 to 300 full-time combatants are foreigners, usually from Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Chechnya, various Arab countries and perhaps even Turkey and western China. They tend to be more fanatical and violent, and they often bring skills such as the ability to post more sophisticated videos on the Internet or bombmaking expertise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/world/asia/30afghan.html?n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Pakistan nytimes.com] Rodhde, David, &quot;Foreign Fighters of Harsher Bent Bolster Taliban&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 30, 2007.

However, Mullen stated that &quot;my priorities&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. given to me by the commander in chief are: Focus on Iraq first. It's been that way for some time. Focus on Afghanistan second.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

In the first five months of 2008, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan increased by over 80% with a surge of 21,643 more troops, bringing the total number of U.S troops in Afghanistan from 26,607 in January to 48,250 in June.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congressional Research Services Report for Congress&amp;nbsp;â U.S. Forces in Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;â Updated July 15, 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RS22633.pdf |title=U.S. Forces in Afghanistan|publisher=Research Services Report for Congress|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, President Bush announced the withdrawal of over 8,000 troops from Iraq in the coming months and a further increase of up to 4,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Guardian]].

On September 3, the war spilled over on to Pakistani territory for the first time when heavily armed [[commando]]s, believed to be US Army Special Forces, landed by helicopter and attacked three houses in a village close to a known Taliban and Al-Qaeda stronghold. The attack killed between seven and twenty people. According to local residents, most of the dead were civilians. Pakistan responded furiously, condemning the attack.

===Coalition issues with Pakistan===
{{Main|Pakistan's role in the War on Terror|PakistanâUnited States skirmishes}}
An unnamed senior Pentagon official told the BBC that at some point between July 12 and September 12, 2008, President George W. Bush issued a classified order to authorize U.S. raids against militants in Pakistan. Pakistan however said it would not allow foreign forces onto its territory and that it would vigorously protect its sovereignty.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7611721.stm |title='Another US strike' hits Pakistan |date=September 12, 2008 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, the Pakistan military stated that it had issued orders to &quot;open fire&quot; on American soldiers who crossed the Pakistan border in pursuit of militant forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26735196/ |title=Pakistan: Shoot GIs on cross-border raidsâPakistanâMSNBC.com |publisher=Msnbc.msn.com |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 2008, Pakistani troops shot towards ISAF helicopters, which belonged to American troops. This caused confusion and anger in the Pentagon, which asked for a full explanation into the incident, and they denied that American choppers were in Pakistani airspace. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was quick to deny that shots were fired but instead insisted that the Pakistani troops shot flares to warn the Americans that they were in Pakistani airspace.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

A further split occurred when American troops apparently landed on Pakistani soil to carry out an operation against militants in the [[North-West Frontier Province|Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] Province but âPakistan reacted angrily to the action, saying 20 innocent villagers had been killed by US troopsâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;big&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7635893.stm |title=Pakistan fires on Nato aircraft |date=September 25, 2008 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite tensions between Pakistan and the U.S., the United States has continued to increase the [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|use of remotely piloted drone aircraft in Pakistan's border regions]], in particular the Federally Administered Tribal Regions (FATA) and Balochistan; as of early 2009, drone attacks were up 183% since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Student Pulse|title=Can the U.S. Win in Afghanistan?|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/3/can-the-us-win-the-war-in-afghanistan|first=Dustin|last=Turin|date=March 23, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A poll by Gallup Pakistan in the summer of 2008 found only 9 percent of Pakistanis in favour of the U.S. drone attacks and 67 percent against, with a majority ranking the United States as a greater threat to Pakistan than its archrival, India, or the Pakistani Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/world/asia/04drones.html|work=The New York Times|title=C.I.A. to Expand Use of Drones in Pakistan|first=Scott|last=Shane|date=December 4, 2009|accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2008, the Taliban apparently had severed remaining ties with al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;edition.cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Nic Robertson]], CNN Senior International Correspondent |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview |title=Sources: Taliban split with al Qaeda, seek peace |publisher=CNN |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to senior U.S. military intelligence officials, there are perhaps fewer than 100 members of Al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Partlow, Joshua.

In a meeting with General McChrystal, Pakistani military officials urged international forces to keep their fight on the Afghan side of the border to prevent militants from fleeing into Pakistan. Pakistan noted that it has 140,000 Pakistani soldiers on its side of the border with Afghanistan to monitor and address militant activities, while the Coalition only has 100,000 soldiers to police the Afghanistan side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2010/02/18/Pakistani-military-outpacing-coalition/UPI-21281266506747/ |title=Pakistani military outpacing coalition? |publisher=United Press International |work=UPI.com |date=2010-02-18 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the increased risk of sending supplies through Pakistan, work began on the establishment of a Northern Distribution Network (NDN) through Russia and several Central Asian republics. Initial permission for the U.S. military to move troop supplies through the region was given on January 20, 2009, after a visit to the region by General Petraeus.&lt;ref name=&quot;PermissionRussiaNYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Oppel |first=Richard A. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/21/world/asia/21pstan.html |title=U.S. secures new supply routes to Afghanistan|location=Afghanistan;Khyber Pass;Russia |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first shipment along the NDN route left on February 20 from [[Riga]], Latvia, then traveled 3,212 miles (5,169&amp;nbsp;km) to the Uzbek town of [[Termez]] on the Afghanistan border.

On May 11, 2009, [[Uzbekistan]] president [[Islam Karimov]] announced that the airport in [[Navoi]], Uzbekistan was being used to transport non-lethal cargo into Afghanistan. Due to the still unsettled relationship between Uzbekistan and the United States following the 2005 [[Andijon massacre]] and subsequent expulsion of U.S. forces from [[Karshi-Khanabad|Karshi-Khanabad airbase]], U.S. forces were not involved in the shipment of supplies. Instead, South Korea's [[Korean Air]], which is currently involved in overhauling Navoi's airport, officially handles logistics at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tynan|first=Deirdre|title=Karimov Gives Washington the Air Base it Needs for Afghan Operations|publisher=EurasiaNet|date=May 11, 2009|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav051109a.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally only non-lethal resources were allowed on the NDN. In July 2009, however, shortly before a visit by President Obama to Moscow, Russian authorities announced that U.S. troops and weapons could use the country's airspace to reach Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|title=Russia Opens Route for U.S. to Fly Arms to Afghanistan|publisher=New York Times|date=July 3, 2009|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/world/europe/04russia.html?_r=1&amp;hp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul sent two classified cables to Washington expressing deep concerns about sending more U.S. troops to Afghanistan until President Hamid Karzai's government demonstrates that it is willing to tackle the corruption and mismanagement that has fueled the Taliban's rise. Ambassador [[Karl W.

On November 26, 2009, Afghan President Hamid Karzai made a public plea to the United States to engage in direct negotiations with the Taliban leadership. In an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]], Karzai said there is an &quot;urgent need&quot; for negotiations with the Taliban, and made it clear that the Obama administration had opposed such talks. There was no formal American response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=49701 |title=IPS Inter Press Service |publisher=Ipsnews.net |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/06/right-after-interviewing-karzai/ |title=Amanpour: Blog Archive&amp;nbsp;â Right after interviewing Karzai |publisher=Amanpour.blogs.cnn.com |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 1, 2009, President Barack Obama announced at The United States Military Academy at Westpoint that the U.S will be sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan.

{{Main|Kunduz Province Campaign}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
In April, German forces stepped up their efforts to retake some rebellious areas of Kunduz province, considered to be the most dangerous part of Northern Afghanistan by ISAF commander McChrystal. The fighting centres upon the areas to the west and south of the city of Kunduz with a main focus on an area between the town of Chahar Dara in the West and the Kunduz river in the east.
Up to now this campaign consisted of several large offensives linked by countless skirmishes and gunfights. Operations of German, Afghan, U.S., and Belgian troops were still ongoing as of December 2009. Insurgent militias suffered more than 650 casualties in this period. At least 86 coalition troops were wounded or killed. On September 4, a [[Kunduz airstrike|devastating NATO air raid]] was conducted 7 kilometres to the southwest of Kunduz where Taliban fighters had hijacked civilian supply trucks, killing Up to 179 people including over 100 Afghan civilians.

Initially, Afghan and American soldiers have been moving into towns and villages along the Helmand River&lt;ref name=&quot;washpost090702&quot; /&gt; to secure the civilian population from the Taliban. The main objective of the operation is to push troops into insurgent strongholds along the river. A secondary aim was to bring security to the Helmand Valley in time for presidential elections, set to take place on August 20. The first aggressive phase will last 36 hours, where the secondary aim will be achieved first.

===Taliban's gains===
According to a December 22, 2009, briefing by Major General [[Michael T.

On August 10, 2009, [[Stanley McChrystal]], the newly appointed U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said that the Taliban had gained the upper hand. In a continuation of the Taliban's usual strategy of summer offensives,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSSP513120070127 &quot;Taliban warn of summer offensive&quot;] Reuters. July 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the militants have aggressively spread their influence into the north and west Afghanistan, and stepped up their attack in an attempt to disrupt August 20 presidential polls.&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin, Sayed and Tait, Paul.

August 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Calling the Taliban a &quot;very aggressive enemy&quot;, he added that the U.S. strategy in the months to come is to stop their momentum and focusing on protecting and safeguarding the Afghan civilians, while also calling it &quot;hard work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yochi Dreazen|Dreazen, Yochi J.]] and Spiegel, Peter.[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124986154654218153.html#articleTabs%3Darticle &quot;Taliban Now Winning&quot;] ''Wall Street Journal'' August 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban's claim of disrupting August 20 elections is largely disputed, claiming over 135 incidents of violence; media was asked to not report on any violent incidents, however,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/08/200981821718308671.html &quot;Kabul urges polls attacks blackout&quot;] Al-Jazeera. August 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; causing many outlets to hail the elections as a success, even though some estimates give the voter turn out as much less than the expected 70 percent. In southern Afghanistan where the Taliban holds the most sway, there was a low voter turnout and sporadic violence directed at voters and security personnel. The chief observer of the European Union election mission, General [[Philippe Morillon]], said the election was &quot;generally fair&quot; but &quot;not free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Entous, Adam and Shalizi, Hamid.

Western groups and election observers had difficulty accessing the southern regions of Afghanistan, where at least 9 Afghan civilians and 14 security forces were killed in attacks intended to intimidate voters. The Taliban released a video days after the elections, filming just up the road between Kabul and Kandahar, a major route in Afghanistan on election day, stopping buses, cars, and asking to see their fingers. The video went on to showing ten men who had voted, being talked to by a Taliban militant, they went on to say they may pardon the voters because of the Holy month of [[Ramadan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/08/200982485130209178.html &quot;Voters targeted after Afghan polls&quot;] Al-Jazeera. August 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban also attacked towns with rockets and other means of indirect fire. Amid claims of widespread fraud, both of the top contenders, Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, claimed victory in the election. Reports also suggest that the turnout was lower than the last election, and there are fears that a results dispute can turn violent, even though both candidates vowed not to incite violence in case of a loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8209279.stm |title=As it happened: Afghan election 2009 |author=Sheerin, Jude |date=August 20, 2009 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Karzai's alleged win of 54 per cent, which would prevent a run off with his rival, [[Abdullah Abdullah]], over 400,000 votes had to be discounted for Karzai, and many more with hundreds of thousands of votes and polling ballots being accused of fraud. Making the real turnout of the elections much lower than the official numbers, many nations criticizing the elections as &quot;free but not fair&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/09/200991015456247534.html &quot;'Fraud proof' found in Afghan polls&quot;] Al-Jazeera.

In December, an [[Forward Operating Base Chapman attack|attack on Forward Operating Base Chapman]], used by the Central Intelligence Agency to gather information and to coordinate drone attacks against Taliban leaders, killed at least six CIA officers and was a major setback for the agency's operations in the region.

==2010: American/British offensive and Afghan peace initiative==
{{See|2010 in Afghanistan}}
In January, 2010, American officials said privately that the Pakistanis are reluctant to go after the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network because they see them as a future proxy against Indian interests in Afghanistan when the Americans leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gay |first=Sheryl |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/world/asia/02prexy.html |title=Obama Adds Troops, but Maps Exit Plan |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in their public statements U.S. officials had previously praised Pakistan's Military effort against the militants during its offensive in South Waziristan in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2009/11/18/US-praises-Pakistani-military-efforts/UPI-87491258576112/ |title=U.S. praises Pakistani military efforts |publisher=United Press International |work=UPI.com |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghan President Hamid Karzai also started peace talks with Haqqani network groups in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/karzai-holds-peace-talks-insurgents-3428064 |agency=Reuters |title=Karzai holds peace talks with insurgents |newspaper=TVNZ |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said that Pakistan has lost over 35 billion U.S. dollars during the previous eight years as a result of the fight against militancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6894010.html |title=U.S. Security Advisor, Pakistani president discuss fight against militancy |work=People's Daily Online |agency=[[Xinhua]] |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Afghan government, approximately 900 Taliban were killed in operations conducted during 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Gall, Carlotta, &quot;Losses In Pakistani Haven Strain Afghan Taliban&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', 1 April 2011, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to increased use of IEDs by insurgents there was a significant increase in the number of injured coalition soldiers, mainly Americans, losing one limb or more or suffering major injury to their genital and pelvic areas.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Tom, &quot;U.S. Troops In Afghanistan Suffer More Critical Injuries&quot;, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 7 April 2011, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace Initiatives===
In October 2008 Defense Secretary Gates asserted that a political settlement with the Taliban was the endgame for the Afghan conflict. &quot;There has to be ultimately&amp;nbsp;â and I'll underscore ultimately&amp;nbsp;â reconciliation as part of a political outcome to this,&quot; Gates stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shah |first=Saeed |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/30/afghanistan.ministry.blast/index.html |title=Suicide bombers target Afghan ministry |publisher=CNN.com |date= October 30, 2008|accessdate=October 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010 peace efforts began. In early January, Taliban commanders held secret exploratory talks with a United Nations special envoy to discuss peace terms. Regional commanders on the Taliban's leadership council, the [[Quetta Shura]], sought a meeting with the UN special representative in Afghanistan, [[Kai Eide]], and it took place in [[Dubai]] on January 8. It was the first such meeting between the UN and senior members of the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borger&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jan/28/taliban-united-nations-afghanistan |title= UN in secret peace talks with Taliban|publisher=Guardian |accessdate=2010-02-09|location=London|first=Julian|last=Borger|date=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 26, 2010, at [[International Conference on Afghanistan London 2010|a major conference in London]] which brought together some 70 countries and organizations,&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; Afghan President Hamid Karzai told world leaders that he intends to reach out to the top echelons of the Taliban within a few weeks with a peace initiative.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt; Karzai set the framework for dialogue with Taliban leaders when he called on the group's leadership to take part in a &quot;loya [[jirga]]&quot;&amp;nbsp;â or large assembly of eldersâto initiate peace talks.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters1&quot;/&gt; Karzai also asked for creation of a new peacemaking organization, to be called the National Council for Peace, Reconciliation and Reintegration.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes1&quot;/&gt; Karzai's top adviser on the reconciliation process with the insurgents said that the country must learn to forgive the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shah |first=Saeed |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/AP/story/1457586.html |title=Afghan government pursues talks with Taliban leaders&amp;nbsp;â World AP |publisher=MiamiHerald.com |accessdate=2010-02-09}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the Karzai government held preliminary talks with Hezb-i-Islami, who presented a plan which included the withdrawal of all foreign troops by the end of 2010. The Taliban declined to participate, saying &quot;The Islamic Emirate has a clear position. We have said this many, many times. There will be no talks when there are foreign troops on Afghanistan's soil killing innocent Afghans on daily basis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62L0PT20100323 |title=Taliban say not involved in Kabul peace talks |publisher=Reuters |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, [[The Guardian]] newspaper reported that the campaign to &quot;win hearts and minds&quot; of Afghan civilians by US troops has been proving more difficult than expected. One US Army report read: &quot;It seems to always be this way when we go there [to meet civilians]. No one wants anything to do with us.&quot; And a report on meeting up with school representatives mentioned students throwing rocks at soldiers and not welcoming their arrival, as has been reported on several occasions elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Simon Tisdall |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/26/us-battle-hearts-minds-afghanistan |title=Afghan war logs: How the US is losing the battle for hearts and minds |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2010-07-28 | location=London | date=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 General David Petraeus commented on the progress of peace talks to date, stating, &quot;The prospect for reconciliation with senior Taliban leaders certainly looms out there...and there have been approaches at (a) very senior level that hold some promise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/02/gates-start-afghanistan-troop-pullout-debate/ |title=Gates Says U.S. Forces in Afghanistan for 'Years' to Come |publisher=Fox News |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deployment of additional US troops continued in early 2010, with 9,000 of the planned 30,000 in place before the end of March and another 18,000 expected by June, with the [[101st Airborne Division]] as the main effort. The Pentagon anticipates that US troops in Afghanistan will outnumber those in Iraq for the first time since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2010/03/25/Afghan-troop-numbers-to-eclipse-Iraq-soon/UPI-69781269532547/ |title=Afghan troop numbers to eclipse Iraq soon |publisher=United Press International |work=UPI.com |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA, from a request by General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, is planning to increase teams of operatives, including their elite paramilitary officers from Special Activities Division (SAD), with U.S. military special operations forces. This combination worked well in Iraq and is largely credited with the success of that surge.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-intel20-2009sep20,0,1183243.story?page=2 |title=CIA expanding presence in Afghanistan |publisher=latimes.com |accessdate=2010-02-09 | first=Greg | last=Miller | date=September 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA is also increasing its campaign using [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire missile]] strikes on [Al-Qaeda in Pakistan.

===Kandahar offensive===
A U.S. and Afghan military offensive, called [[Operation Hamkari]], focusing on the Afghan province of Kandahar was launched soon after the Muslim holiday of Ramadan, which ended September 10. The Kandahar offensive was originally planned to be launched during July, but was delayed for further preparations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minnpost.com/globalpost/2010/08/25/20845/major_kandahar_offensive_delayed_as_counterinsurgency_strategy_pushes_forward |title=Major Kandahar offensive delayed as counterinsurgency strategy pushes forward |publisher=MinnPost |date=2010-08-25 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The offensive did not begin as one specific operation, but rather a series of operations in Kandahar City and its surrounding districts throughout the late summer and fall in 2010. Places where operations were conducted included Malajat, Zhari, Arghandab and the Horn of Panjwayi. Operations conducted in 2010 is credited with putting severe pressure on insurgent operations and increasing security in some key areas such as in Panjwayi. Unlike operations of previous years, Operation Hamkari featured the extensive use of Afghan National Security Forces, including the Afghan Border Police (ABP), led by Spin Boldak ABP Commander Gen. Abdul Razziq.

[[Operation Baawar|Operation Bawaar]] was the Canadian aspect of the 2010 Kandahar offensive. It involved the hold and build in the district of Zangabad as well as the Ground Line of Communication (GLOC) project to Mushan - all in an area known as the Horn of Panjwai.

===Pakistan and U.S. tensions===
{{main|PakistanâUnited States skirmishes|PakistanâUnited States relations}}
Tensions between Pakistan and the U.S. were heightened in late September after several Pakistan Frontier Corps soldiers were killed and wounded. The troops were attacked by a U.S. piloted aircraft that was pursuing Taliban forces near the Afghan-Pakistan border but for unknown reasons opened fire on two different Pakistan border posts. In retaliation for the strike, Pakistan closed the Torkham ground border crossing to NATO supply convoys for an unspecified period. This incident followed the recent release of a video allegedly showing uniformed Pakistan soldiers executing unarmed civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/world/asia/01peshawar.html?_r=1&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | title=Signaling Tensions, Pakistan Shuts NATO Route | first1=Jane | last1=Perlez | first2=Helene | last2=Cooper | date=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Torkham border closing, the Pakistani Taliban attacked the NATO convoys carrying supplies, killing several of the drivers and destroying around 100 tankers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Taliban+ramp+attacks+against+NATO/3636093/story.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raids on Taliban leaders===
Beginning in May, 2010 NATO special forces began to concentrate on surgical operations to capture or kill specific Taliban leaders. As of March 2011, according to the US military, the operations had resulted in the capture or killing of more than 900 low and mid-level Taliban commanders. The effectiveness of the operations in defeating the Taliban was not yet known.&lt;ref&gt;Vanden Brook, Tom, &quot;U.S.: Raids Have Taken Out 900 Taliban Leaders&quot;, ''[[USA Today]]'', 8 March 2011, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Battle of Kandahar was part of an offensive named after the [[Battle of Badr|Battle of Bad'r]] that took place on March 13, 624, between [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. The Battle followed an announcement, April 30, 2011, that Taliban would launch their Spring offensive throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban Say Offensive Will Begin Sunday|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/world/asia/01afghan.html|work=NYTimes|publisher=NYTimes|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=1 May|year=2011|first=Alissa J.|last=Rubin |authorlink= Alissa J.

On May 7, 2011, the Taliban launched a major offensive on Government buildings in Kandahar. Around 12:30 PM local time, the Taliban unleashed a major assault on government buildings throughout the city. The Taliban said their goal was to take control of Kandahar city. At least eight locations were attacked: the governor's compound, the mayor's office, the [[National Directorate of Security (Afghanistan)|NDS]] headquarters, three police stations and two high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban Attack Afghan Government Offices in South|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/05/07/world/asia/AP-AS-Afghanistan.html|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NYTimes|accessdate=7 May 2011|date=7 May|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2011, US officials announced that al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in a Special Operation to kill or capture Osama Bin Laden, conducted by the CIA and United States Navy SEALs (under the direction of President Obama), in Pakistan. Crowds gathered outside the White House in Washington, DC, chanting &quot;USA, USA&quot; after the news emerged, and President Barack Obama addressed the nation and the world from the East Room of the White House to tell the world of the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden dead - Obama|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-13256676|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 May 2011|date=2 May|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following suit, other NATO countries announced reductions in troop numbers.

France has announced that it would withdraw roughly 1,000 soldiers by the end of 2012, with 3,000 soldiers remaining in Afghanistan at that point. Several hundreds would gradually come back at the end of 2011 and in the beginning of 2012, when the Afghan National Army takes control of the Surobi district. The remaining troops will continue to operate in Kapisa, and their complete withdrawal is expected by the end of 2014 or earlier if the security in this district is considered good enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/24/world/la-fg-france-afghanistan-20110624 |title=French troops Afghanistan: France to gradually withdraw troops from Afghanistan - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2011-08-02 |first=Kim |last=Willsher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/8631547/Nicolas-Sarkozy-announces-France-to-withdraw-1000-troops-from-Afghanistan-by-end-of-2012.html |title=French troops Afghanistan: Nicolas Sarkozy announces France to withdraw 1,000 troops from Afghanistan by end of 2012 - The Telegraph |publisher=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2011-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/asie-pacifique/article/2011/07/12/nicolas-sarkozy-en-visite-eclair-en-afghanistan_1547587_3216.html |title=Afghanistan : Sarkozy confirme le retrait de 1 000 soldats franÃ§ais d'ici Ã  fin 2012 (french)/ Sarkozy confirms that 1.000 soldiers will be withdrawn by the end of 2012 - Le Monde |publisher=http://www.lemonde.fr |date=2011-07-12 |accessdate=2011-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ANA/Australian Incident===
On October 30, 2011, an ANA soldier opened fire on Australian forces, shooting 11 people. This attack killed 3 Australian soldiers and an Afghan Army interpreter and severely wounded 7 Australians. The ANA soldier responsible for the attack was killed during the gunfight. It was the bloodiest incident for Australian forces since 2001, and the worst for the ADF since the Vietnam war. This incident raised serious questions of Australias commitment to the Afghanistan war and if success with working alongside the ANA was even possible. The attack weakened trust between Australian and ANA forces and led to weapons being confiscated from the ANA soldiers for several days. The Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard reaffirmed her government's support for Australian involvement. A similar attack occurred just 10 days later on November 9, 2011, when an ANA soldier opened fire wounding 3 Australians and 2 Afghan soldiers.

In a 2008 interview, the then-head U.S. Central Command General [[David H. Petraeus]], insisted that the Taliban were gaining strength. He cited the recent uptick in attacks in Afghanistan and in neighboring Pakistan. Petraeus also insisted that the challenges faced in Afghanistan are more complicated than the ones that were faced in Iraq during his tour and to turn around the recent events this would require removing militant sanctuaries and strongholds, which are widespread inside Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times: International.

Observers also have argued that the mission in Afghanistan is hampered by a lack of agreement on objectives, a lack of resources, lack of coordination, too much focus on the central government at the expense of local and provincial governments, and too much focus on Afghanistan instead of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18911/afghanistan.html |title=Afghanistan: Changing the Frame, Changing the Game.

According to a November, 2009 [[UNICEF]] report, eight years after the U.S.-led invasion ousted the Taliban, Afghanistan is the most dangerous place in the world for a child to be born.

So, for them, I don't think that we have a way forward with talks or negotiations or contacts or anything as such. Then we have to be prepared to tackle and deal with them militarily.

==Possible long-term U.S. role and military presence==
[[File:US soldiers with cows in Kunar Povince of Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|A US Soldier from 91st Cavalry Regiment (Airborne) watches cattle make room for a CH-47 helicopter landing in [[Kunar Province]].]]
In 2004, many of the thousands of U.S. troops in Afghanistan were positioned in what experts said were large, permanent bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/03/21/MNGJ65OS4J1.DTL&amp;type=printable |title=After 9/11, U.S. policy built on world bases |publisher=Sfgate.com |date=2004-03-21 |accessdate=2011-08-02 |first=James |last=Sterngold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2009, hundreds of millions of dollars were being spent on permanent infrastructure for foreign military bases in Afghanistan, including a budget of $1.6 billion for military installations at the [[Kandahar Air Field]] base, described as &quot;a walled, multicultural military city that houses some 13,000 troops from 17 different countries&amp;nbsp;â the kind of place where you can eat at a Dutch chain restaurant alongside soldiers from the Royal Netherlands Army.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Base In Afghanistan Gets Major Expansion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92427328 |title=NATO Base In Afghanistan Gets Major Expansion |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bagram Airfield]], run by the U.S. military, was also expanding according to military officials, with the U.S military buying land from Afghan locals in different places for further expansion of the base.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Base In Afghanistan Gets Major Expansion&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/eric_margolis/2009/01/11/7985676-sun.html U.S. hopes to supply victory]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, [[The Times]] reported that the U.S. will build two large new military bases in southern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;British to play smaller role as US troops fight âlosing battleâ&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5721192.ece British to play smaller role as US troops fight âlosing battleâ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One will be built in [[Kandahar province]] near the Helmand border, at [[Maiwand]]. The other new U.S. military base will be built in Zabul, a province now largely controlled by the Taliban and criminal gangs.&lt;ref name=&quot;British to play smaller role as US troops fight âlosing battleâ&quot; /&gt;

President Obama has since stated that all U.S. Troops will be out by 2014.

===Geo-strategic military build-up===
The dramatic build-up of an indefinite American/American-led military presence in Afghanistan has unsettled some regional powers, including Russia. Russia has agreed to let the United States and NATO use its airspace for logistical purposes, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Base In Afghanistan Gets Major Expansion&quot; /&gt;

&quot;Is it all to fight a number of Taliban&amp;nbsp;â 10,000, 12,000 Taliban?&quot; Zamir Kabulov, Russia's ambassador to Kabul, has proposed. &quot;Maybe this [[infrastructure]], military infrastructure, [is] not only for internal purposes but for regional also.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Base In Afghanistan Gets Major Expansion&quot; /&gt; Russia views the large and indefinite military build-up as a potential threat &quot;because Afghanistan's geographical location is a very strategic one,&quot; Kabulov said. &quot;It's very close to three main world basins of hydrocarbons: Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea, Central Asia.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Base In Afghanistan Gets Major Expansion&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=newint&gt;

===Public opinion in 2001===
When the invasion began in October 2001, polls indicated that about 88% of Americans and about 65% of Britons backed military action in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;AEI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.22819/pub_detail.asp|title = America and the War on Terror|accessdate = September 27, 2007|publisher = AEI Public Opinion Study}} Published July 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale 37-nation poll of world opinion carried out by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] International in late September 2001 found that large majorities in most countries favored a legal response, in the form of extradition and trial, over a military response to 9/11: Only in three countries out of the 37 surveyed&amp;nbsp;â the United States, Israel, and India&amp;nbsp;â did majorities favor military action in Afghanistan. In the other 34 countries surveyed, the poll found many clear majorities that favored extradition and trial instead of military action: in the United Kingdom (75%), France (67%), Switzerland (87%), Czech Republic (64%), Lithuania (83%), Panama (80%), Mexico (94%), and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/empire/media/2001/1121opinion.htm &quot;World Opinion Opposes the Attack on Afghanistan&quot;] www.globalpolicy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0201strangevic.html|title=Strange Victory: A critical appraisal of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Afghanistan war}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Ipsos-Reid]] poll conducted between November and December 2001 showed that majorities in Canada (66%), France (60%), Germany (60%), Italy (58%), and the U.K. (65%) approved of U.S. airstrikes while majorities in Argentina (77%), China (52%), South Korea (50%), Spain (52%), and Turkey (70%) opposed them.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aei.org/publications/filter.all,pubID.22819/pub_detail.asp|title = America and the War on Terror|accessdate = September 27, 2007|publisher = AEI Public Opinion Study}} Published July 24, 2008.

===Development of public opinion===
{{See also|International public opinion on the war in Afghanistan}}
{{Globalize|USA|date=May 2011}}
In a 47-nation June 2007 survey of global public opinion, the [[Pew Global Attitudes Project]] found international opposition to the war. Out of the 47 countries surveyed, 4 had a majority that favoured keeping foreign troops: the U.S. (50%), Israel (59%), Ghana (50%), and Kenya (60%).&lt;ref name=&quot;47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/pdf/256.pdf |title=47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 41 of the 47 countries, [[plurality (voting)|pluralities]] want U.S. and NATO troops out of Afghanistan as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116&quot; /&gt; In 32 out of 47 countries, clear majorities wanted this war over as soon as possible. Majorities in 7 out of 12 NATO member countries say troops should be withdrawn as soon as possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;47-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Survey p.24, p.116&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Survey Reports |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=256 |title=Global Unease With Major World Powers |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 24-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey in June 2008 similarly found that majorities or pluralities in 21 of 24 countries want the U.S. and NATO to remove their troops from Afghanistan as soon as possible. Only in three out of the 24 countries&amp;nbsp;â the United States (50%), Australia (60%), and Britain (48%)&amp;nbsp;â did public opinion lean more toward keeping troops there until the situation has stabilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Survey Reports |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=260 |title=June 2008 Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Survey Reports |url=http://pewglobal.org/reports/display.php?ReportID=260 |title=24-Nation Pew Global Attitudes Project Survey p.8, p.29 |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that June 2008 global survey, however, public opinion in Australia and Britain has also diverged from that in the U.S., and a majority of Australians and Britons now want their troops to be brought home from Afghanistan. A September 2008 poll found that 56% of Australians opposed the continuation of their country's military involvement in Afghanistan, while 42% support it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Australians lose faith in Afghan war effort&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/australians-lose-faith-in-afghan-war-effort/1320931.aspx|title=Australians lose faith in Afghan war effort}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Opposition mounts against Afghan war&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/29/2377129.htm?section=world|title=Government losing support for Afghanistan campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/opposition-mounts-against-afghan-war-20080929-4qew.html|title=Opposition mounts against Afghan war | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | date=September 30, 2008 | first=Daniel | last=Flitton}}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 2008 poll found that 68% of Britons want their troops withdrawn within the next 12 months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britons call for troop withdrawal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7725228.stm |title=Britons call for troop withdrawal |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Most Britons want troops out of Afghanistan: poll&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iDAlDVoYEb9h6trv1wYV55GKVVSA |title=Most Britons wanted troops out of Afghanistan: poll |publisher=Afp.google.com |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/view/32241/britons_would_leave_afghanistan_in_2009 |title=Britons Would Leave Afghanistan in 2009 |publisher=Angus-reid.com |date=2008-22-11 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, in the United States, a September 2008 Pew survey found that 61% of Americans wanted U.S. troops to stay until the situation has stabilized, while 33% wanted them removed as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people-press.org/report/?pageid=1384 Views on Iraq and Afghanistan]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2009 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll, a record{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} 66% of Americans said things were going badly for the U.S. in Afghanistan, up from 61% in early September.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} However, while public opinion was divided over Afghan troop requests, a majority of Americans continued to see a rationale for the use of military force in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Public Divided Over Afghan Troop Requests, But Still Sees Rationale for War|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1400/public-divided-over-afghanistan-troop-requests-still-sees-rationale-for-war|newspaper=Pew Research Center Publications|date=11-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A slight plurality of Americans favored troop increases, with 42%â47% favoringat least some troop increases to satisfy the military's requests, 39%â44% wanting reduction, and 7â9% wanting no changes in troop levels. Just 29% of [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] favor any troop increases while 57% want to begin reducing troops. 36% of Americans approved of Obama's handling of Afghanistan, including 19% of [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]], 31% of [[political independent|independents]], and 54% of Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/124490/In-U.S.-More-Support-Increasing-Troops-Afghanistan.aspx |title=In U.S., More Support for Increasing Troops in Afghanistan |publisher=Gallup.com |date=2009-11-25 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] poll, only 32 percent of Americans favored increasing U.S. troops in Afghanistan, while 40 percent favored decreasing them. Almost half of Americans, 49 percent, believed that the U.S. should &quot;mind its own business&quot; internationally and let other countries get along the best they can. That figure was an increase from 30 percent who said that in December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/569/americas-place-in-the-world |title=U.S. Seen as Less Important, China as More Powerful: Overview&amp;nbsp;â Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press |publisher=People-press.org |date=2009-12-03 |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a April 2011 Pew Research Center poll, there was little change in the American public's views about Afghanistan, with about 50% saying that the U.S. military effort was going very well or fairly well and only 44% supporting NATO troop presence in Afghanistan. The new survey shows little change since then â 50% favor removing U.S. and NATO troops as soon as possible while 44% favor maintaining the troops in Afghanistan until the situation is stabilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Goal of Libyan Operation Less Clear to Public|url=http://people-press.org/2011/04/05/goal-of-libyan-operation-less-clear-to-public/|newspaper=Pew resaerch center|date=04-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pentagon management of public opinion====
{{One source|date=May 2011}}
The Pentagon may have recast and timed the release in June 2010 of old information about Afghanistan's substantial mineral wealth, including billions of dollars worth of copper, lithium, iron and gold reserves, as part of a public relations campaign aimed at garnering the waning support of the US public for the war.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The decades' old Soviet geological surveys showing vast mineral riches of Afghanistan were known to US officials years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo News, 14 June 2010, &quot;Afghan Mineral Wealth Raises Host of Questions,&quot; http://news.yahoo.com/s/ynews/ynews_ts2565&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ipsnorthamerica.net&quot;&gt;Inter Press Service, 15 June 2010, &quot;Timing of Leak of Afghan Mineral Wealth Evokes Skepticism,&quot; http://ipsnorthamerica.net/news.php?idnews=3124&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the story in June 2010 to the [[New York Times]] by the Pentagon appeared to many observers to be part of an effort to buy additional time for the US counterinsurgency.&lt;ref name=&quot;ipsnorthamerica.net&quot;/&gt;

===Afghan opinions===
Recent polls of Afghans have found strong opposition to the Taliban and significant, albeit diminished support of the American military presence. Also, the idea of permanent U.S. military bases vexes many people in Afghanistan, which has a long history of resisting foreign invaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Permanent U.S. bases? Afghans see an election issue&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Group of Women Wearing Burkas.jpg|file|thumb|right|Afghan women wait outside a USAID-supported health care clinic.]]
According to a May 2009 BBC poll, 69% of Afghans surveyed thought it was at least mostly good that the U.S. military came in to remove the Taliban&amp;nbsp;â a decrease from 87% of Afghans surveyed in 2005. 24% thought it was mostly or very bad&amp;nbsp;â up from 9% in 2005. The poll indicated that 63% of Afghans were at least somewhat supportive of a U.S. military presence in the country&amp;nbsp;â down from 78% in 2005. Just 18% supported increasing the U.S. military's presence, while 44% favored reducing it. 90% of Afghans surveyed opposed the presence of Taliban fighters, including 70% who were strongly opposed. By an 82%â4% margin, people said they preferred the current government to Taliban rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/05_02_09afghan_poll_2009.pdf |title=Afghan Poll 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-03 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 2009 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] survey, about half of Afghan respondents felt that additional U.S. forces would help stabilize the security situation in the southern provinces. But opinions varied widely across Afghanistan at the time; residents in the troubled South were mostly mixed or uncertain, while those in the West largely disagreed that more U.S. troops would help the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/123335/Nearly-Half-Afghans-Think-Troops-Help.aspx |title=Gallup poll |publisher=Gallup.com |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, many Afghan tribal heads and local leaders from the Pashtun south and eastâthe heartland of the Taliban insurgencyâcalled for U.S. troop withdrawals. &quot;I don't think we will be able to solve our problems with military force,&quot; said Muhammad Qasim, a tribal elder from the southern province of Kandahar. &quot;We can solve them by providing jobs and development and by using local leaders to negotiate with the Taliban.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopal |first=Anand |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125960550353170023.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsTop |title=Karzai Aides, Tribal Leaders Say Surge Is Wrong Strategy&amp;nbsp;â WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;If new troops come and are stationed in civilian areas, when they draw Taliban attacks civilians will end up being killed,&quot; said Gulbadshah Majidi, a lawmaker and close associate of Mr. Karzai. &quot;This will only increase the distance between Afghans and their government.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;online.wsj.com&quot;/&gt;

In late January 2010, Afghan protesters took to the streets for three straight days and blocked traffic on a highway that links Kabul and Kandahar. The Afghans were demonstrating in response to the deaths of four men in a NATO-Afghan raid in the village of [[Ghazni]]. Ghazni residents insisted that the dead were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epaper.orlandosentinel.com/OS/OS/2010/01/24/ArticleHtmls/24_01_2010_004_010.shtml epaper.orlandosentinel.com]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civilian casualties==
[[File:Narang night raid.jpg|thumb|Victimsâ of the [[Narang night raid]] that killed at least 10 Afghan civilians, including eight schoolchildren.]]
{{Main|Civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)}}

There is no single official figure for the overall number of civilians killed by the war since 2001, but estimates for specific years or periods have been published by a number of organizations.

The [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan|UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) reported that 2,118 Afghan civilians were killed by armed conflict in 2008, the highest number since the end of the initial 2001 invasion. This represented an increase of about 40% over UNAMA's figure of 1,523 Afghan civilians killed in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Number of Afghan civilian deaths in 2008 highest since Taliban ouster, says UN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unama-afg.org/_latestnews/2009/09feb17-civilian-casualties.html|title = Number of Afghan civilian deaths in 2008 highest since Taliban ouster, says UN|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2009, in an interview with Margaret Warner of ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', General [[David D. McKiernan]], then commander of all foreign military forces in Afghanistan, claimed that 80% of civilian casualties in Afghanistan were caused by the Taliban. He added that &quot;by the very nature of an insurgency&quot;, it &quot;mixes in on purpose with the civilian population.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lehrer, Jim, &quot;Interview with General McKiernan&quot;, ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service]], March 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to that, UNAMA attributed 55% of the civilian deaths it tracked in 2008 to anti-government forces, 39% to international-led military forces, while the remaining 6% could not be attributed because they died in crossfire or were killed by [[unexploded ordnance]], for example.&lt;ref name=&quot;Number of Afghan civilian deaths in 2008 highest since Taliban ouster, says UN&quot; /&gt;

On May 11, 2009, U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] abruptly replaced McKiernan with U.S. Army General Stanley A. McChrystal as the new U.S. commander of all foreign military forces in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=Mark |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1897555,00.html |title=Why the Pentagon Axed Its Afghanistan Warlord |publisher=Time.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of General McChrystal's first announcements was a sharp restriction on the use of [[airstrikes]] to reduce civilian casualties. Afghan leaders have long pleaded that foreign troops end airstrikes and nighttime raids of Afghan homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/06/mil-090623-voa03.htm &quot;US Will Restrict Afghan Air Strikes to Reduce Civilian Casualties&quot;] www.globalsecurity.com. June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the United Nations, the Taliban were responsible for 76 % of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;/&gt; The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIGRC) called the Taliban's terrorism against the Afghan civilian population a war crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolonews&quot;/&gt;

Very few people in Afghanistan have been unaffected by the armed conflict there. Those with direct personal experience make up 60% of the population, and most others also
report suffering a range of serious hardships. In total, almost everyone (96%) has been affected in some way&amp;nbsp;â either personally or due to the wider consequences of armed
conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/views-from-field-report-240609/$File/Our-World-Views-from-Afghanistan-I-ICRC.pdf Afghanistan, Opinion survey 2009 ], by ICRC and Ipsos&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of civilian casualties is recognized as a problem at the highest levels of ISAF command. In a September 2009 report, Gen. Stanley McChrystal wrote &quot;Civilian casualties and collateral damage to homes and property resulting from an over-reliance on firepower and force protection have severely damaged ISAF's legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On September 9, 2010, it was revealed that 12 US soldiers face trial over a secret [[FOB Ramrod kill team|kill team]] that allegedly killed Afghan civilians at random and collected their fingers as trophies. 5 of the soldiers are charged with murdering 3 Afghan men who were allegedly killed for sport in separate attacks this year. 7 other soldiers are accused of covering up the killings as well as a violent assault on a new recruit who exposed the murders when he reported other abuses, including members of the unit smoking [[hashish]] stolen from civilians. The Army Times reported that a least one of the soldiers collected the fingers of the victims as souvenirs and that some of them posed for photographs with the bodies.

The extermination of the poppy crops is not seen as a viable option because the sale of poppies constitutes the livelihood of Afghanistan's rural farmers.

The Taliban who ruled Afghanistan for five years from September 1996 until the U.S. attacks in 2001 were notorious for their human rights abuses against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/taliban.html|title=Who Are the Taliban?}}&lt;/ref&gt; A U.N. official said the Taliban committed war crimes of the same type as the ones committed in [[Bosnia]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; According to a 55-page report by the United Nations, the Taliban, while trying to consolidate control over northern and western Afghanistan, committed systematic massacres against civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; U.N. officials stated that there had been &quot;15 massacres&quot; between 1996 and 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; They also said that &quot;[t]hese have been highly systematic and they all lead back to the [Taliban] Ministry of Defense or to Mullah Omar himself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; The Taliban especially targeted people of Shia religious or Hazara ethnic background.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; Upon taking Mazar-i-Sharif in 1998, about 4,000 civilians were executed by the Taliban and many more reported [[torture]]d.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCR 1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch 1998&quot;/&gt; The documents also reveal the role of Arab and Pakistani support troops in these killings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt; Bin Laden's so-called [[055 Brigade]] was responsible for mass-killings of Afghan civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot; /&gt; The report by the United Nations quotes eyewitnesses in many villages describing Arab fighters carrying long knives used for slitting throats and skinning people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;papillonsartpalace.com&quot;/&gt;

In Afghanistan women and girls today suffer high levels of violence and discrimination and have poor access to justice and education, [[Human Rights Watch]] concluded in a December, 2009 report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2009/12/03/we-have-promises-world |title=We Have the Promises of the World|publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=2009-12-06 |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One recent nationwide survey of levels of violence against Afghan women found that 52 percent of respondents experienced physical violence, and 17 percent reported sexual violence. Yet because of social and legal obstacles to accessing justice, few women and girls report violence to the authorities. These barriers are particularly formidable in rape cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacw.net/article1272.html |title=Afghanistan: Extremist Threat to Women Increasing, Government Failing to Protect&amp;nbsp;â South Asia Citizens Web |publisher=Sacw.net |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]] estimates that more than 80 percent of females lack access to education centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-tc-nw-afghan-schools-0107jan08,0,457737.story |title=Afghanistan: Activist helps Afghans fight odds to keep girls schools open&amp;nbsp;â Chicago Tribune Archives |publisher=Chicagotribune.com |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female literacy is 10%.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune.com&quot;/&gt;

===Taliban===
According to a report by the United Nations, the Taliban were responsible for 76 % of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;/&gt; The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIGRC) called the Taliban's terrorism against the Afghan civilian population a war crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolonews&quot;/&gt; Religious leaders condemned Taliban terrorist attacks and said these kinds of attacks are against Islamic ethics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolonews&quot;/&gt;

According to Amnesty International, the Taliban commit war crimes by targeting civilians, including killing teachers, abducting aid workers and burning school buildings. Amnesty International said that up to 756 civilians were killed in 2006 by bombs, mostly on roads or carried by suicide attackers belonging to the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conflict, NATO has alleged that the Taliban have used civilians as human shields. As an example, NATO pointed to the victims of NATO air strikes in Farah province in May 2009, during which the Afghan government claims up to 150 civilians were killed. NATO stated that it had evidence that the Taliban forced civilians into buildings likely to be targeted by NATO aircraft involved in the battle. US Lieutenant Colonel Greg Julian, a spokesman for General McKiernan, NATO's Afghanistan commander, said of the Taliban's tactics, &quot;This was a deliberate plan by the Taliban to create a civilian casualty crisis. These were not human shields; these were human sacrifices. We have intelligence that points to this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Sara A.|first2=Bill|last2=Gertz|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/12/ousted-commanders-aide-blames-deaths-on-taliban/|accessdate=December 2, 2009|title=Afghan commander's aide blames deaths on Taliban|newspaper=[[Washington Times]]|date=May 12, 2009|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[NATO]] has so far not been able to provide this intelligence.

The increase in Taliban power has also led to increased human rights violations against women in Afghanistan, according to the U.S. State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2003/27943.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections During Combat===
Several elections have been held in Afghanistan since 2001.
The most recent election was held September 18, 2010, for the Afghan Parliament with a reported 2,499 candidates competing for 250 seats. During the elections &lt;ref&gt;[http://afghanistan-journal.com/blog/2010/09/afghan-election-reveals-demons-heroes/ Afghan Journal: Heroes &amp; Demons] September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the Taliban attacked many of those involved, killing 11 civilians and 3 Afghan National Policemen in over 300 attacks on the polls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://waronterrornews.typepad.com/home/2010/09/enemy-elects-explosives.html Afghanistan: Taliban Elect Explosives] September 18, 2010
&lt;/ref&gt; The low death toll at the hands of the Taliban can be attributed to stepped up operations specifically targeting the leaders of insurgents planning attacks in the days leading up to the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waronterrornews.typepad.com/home/2010/09/18-afghanistan-news.html |title=War In Afghanistan News|publisher=Waronterrornews.typepad.com |date=2010-09-18 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waronterrornews.typepad.com/home/2010/09/17-afghanistan-news.html |title=War In Afghanistan News 17 Sep 2010 |publisher=Waronterrornews.typepad.com |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2011-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which captured hundreds of insurgents and explosives.
Turnout at election was only 40%.

===Former Afghan warlords===
Former Afghan warlords and political strongmen supported by the US during the ousting of the Taliban were responsible for numerous human rights violations in 2003 including kidnapping, rape, robbery, and extortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/press/2003/07/afghan072903.htm Afghanistan: Warlords Implicated in New Abuses] July 29, 2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over torture===
In March 2002, ABC News claimed top officials at the CIA authorized controversial, harsh interrogation techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1322866|title=ABC News: CIA's Harsh Interrogation Techniques Described}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible interrogation techniques included shaking and slapping, shackling prisoners in a standing position, keeping the prisoner in a cold cell and dousing them with water, and [[water boarding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt; A United Nations study in 2011 reported on interviews with 379 detainees. It found those held by police or intelligence services were subjected to beatings, removal of toenails and electric shocks.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian systematically tortured&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/10/afghanistan-torture | title=Afghanistan officials 'systematically tortured' detainees, says UN report | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2011-10-10 | accessdate=October 10, 2011 | author=Kelly, Jeremy | location=Kabul | quote=Interviews with 379 people held by police or intelligence services describe beatings, removing toenails and electric shocks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==White phosphorus use==
[[White phosphorus]] has been condemned by human rights organizations as cruel and inhumane because it causes severe burns. There are cases that have been confirmed of white phosphorus burns on the bodies of civilians wounded in Afghanistan caused by clashes between U.S. and Taliban forces near [[Bagram]]. The United States claims at least 44 instances in which militants have used white phosphorus in weapons or attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Straziuso|first=Jason|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/11/taliban-phosphorus-attacks-afghanistan|accessdate=December 2, 2009|title=U.S.: Afghan Militants Use White Phosphorus|newspaper=[[guardian.co.uk]]|date=May 11, 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, Colonel [[Gregory Julian]], a spokesman for General [[David McKiernan]], the overall commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, confirmed that Western military forces in Afghanistan use white phosphorus to illuminate targets or as an incendiary to destroy bunkers and enemy equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-39498520090508?sp=true|accessdate=December 2, 2009|title=EXCLUSIVE&amp;nbsp;â Afghan girl's burns show horror of chemical strike|date=May 8, 2009|newspaper=[[Reuters India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/asia/20ambush.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=December 2, 2009|title=Pinned Down, a Sprint to Escape Taliban Zone|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=April 19, 2009|first=C.
