== History ==
Cudahy is named for its founder, [[Meat packing industry|meat-packing]] baron [[Michael Cudahy (meat packing)|Michael Cudahy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Status1&quot;&gt;Quinones, Sam. &quot;Novices threaten Cudahy's status quo.&quot; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.

Such parcels, often referred to as &quot;railroad lots&quot;, were intended to allow the new town's residents to keep a large [[vegetable garden]], a grove of [[fruit tree]]s (usually citrus), and a [[chicken coop]] or [[Stable|horse stable]].  This arrangement, popular in the towns along the lower [[Los Angeles River|Los Angeles]] and [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel]] rivers, proved particularly attractive to the Southerners and Midwesterners who were leaving their struggling farms in droves in the [[1910s]] and [[1920s]] to start new lives in [[Southern California]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Sam Quinones of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said that the large, narrow parcels of land gave Cudahy Acres a &quot;rural feel in an increasingly urban swath.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Status1&quot;/&gt; As late as the [[1950s]], some Cudahy residents were still riding into the city's downtown areas on horseback.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} After [[World War II]] the city was a [[White American]] blue collar town with steel and automobile plants in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Status1&quot;/&gt;

By the late 1970s, the factories closed down and the white American residents of Cudahy left for jobs and housing in the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys. Stucco apartment complexes were built on former tracts of land. The population density increased; in 2007 the city was the second-densest in California, after [[Maywood, California|Maywood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Status2&quot;&gt;Quinones, Sam. &quot;Novices threaten Cudahy's status quo.&quot; ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.
