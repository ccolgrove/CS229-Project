The Ministry of Foreign Affairs ''(Ministerstwo Spraw Zagranicznych)'' is the Polish government department tasked with maintaining Poland's international relations and coordinating its participation in international and regional supra-national political organisations such as the [[European Union]] and [[United Nations]]. It is considered to be one of the most important offices of state. The head of the ministry is a full secretary of state and thus holds a place in the [[Council of Ministers of Poland|Council of Ministers]].

==Remit and responsibilities of the ministry==
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible primarily for maintaining good, friendly relations between the Polish Republic and other states. In doing so it is required to act primarily as a representative of the Polish people. To this end all [[Diplomatic missions of Poland|Polish diplomatic missions]] around the world are subordinate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ambassadors, whilst receiving their credentials from the [[President of Poland]], are employees of the foreign ministry and are recommended to the President for their posts by the minister of foreign affairs.

The ministry is considered to be one of Poland's most important, with the minister of foreign affairs ranking amongst the most influential people in Polish politics. This position is typically reserved for seasoned, professional politicians, and is thought to require a great deal of tact and intellect. 

==History==
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was first established, with Leon Wasilewski as its secretary, under the authority of the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] when Poland regained (albeit in name only) its independence from the occupying [[German Empire|German]] forces in the [[First World War]]. However, the ministry began to fulfil its ascribed duties truly only after the fall of the Regency Council, adoption of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the rise to power of [[JÃ³zef PiÅsudski]]. The ministry was then, until 1939, located in central [[Warsaw]], with its seat in the [[BrÃ¼hl Palace, Warsaw|BrÃ¼hl Palace]] on [[PiÅsudski Square]]. During the [[Second World War]], the ministry was evacuated, along with the rest of the Polish government, first to France and then onwards to London, where it formed part of the [[Polish government in exile]]. During this period [[Edward Bernard RaczyÅski|Count Edward RaczyÅski]], a man who was later to become President of the government in exile, was the minister responsible. After 1945, when most countries began to afford diplomatic regocnition to the new communist government in Warsaw, at the expense of the government in exile, the authorities of the new [[People's Republic of Poland]] refounded the ministry and appointed, as its first minister, [[Edward OsÃ³bka-Morawski]]. 

Since 1989 and the establishment of the Third Republic, the ministry and its staff have been located in a complex of buildings on Aleje Szucha in central Warsaw, not far displaced from the [[Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland|Chancellery of the Prime Minister]]. 

The current minister of foreign affairs is [[RadosÅaw Sikorski]], a career politician educated at the [[University of Oxford]], who was previously [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister for National Defence]], and who has in the past served as both a member of the [[Sejm]] and the [[Polish Senate|Senat]].
