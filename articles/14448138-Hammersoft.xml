== History ==
=== Chief Editors ===

[[File: VKB Nair.jpg|thumb|right|150px|V.K.B. Nair]]
THE WEEK was launched by The Malayala Manorama Co. Ltd in December, 1982, and has had two chief editors, before the designation was discontinued.
* [[K.M. Mathew]] ([[Padma Bhushan]],1998) &lt;ref&gt;http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmabhushan_awards_list1.php?start=380&lt;/ref&gt;, the founder chief editor, remained in office until December 25, 1988. Popularly known as Mathukuttychayan, he was chairman of the Press Trust of India, president of the Indian Newspaper Society and chairman of the Audit Bureau of Circulations. He died on August 1, 2010. The obit which appeared in [[The Times of India]] said, &quot;The highly acclaimed English news magazine-The Week-was his brainchild.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-01/india/28282220_1_k-m-mathew-puthenpally-malayala-manorama&lt;/ref&gt;
* K.M. Mathew's eldest son, Mammen Mathew,&lt;ref&gt;http://thomsonreuters.com/about/trust_principles/trustee_directors/mammen_mathew/&lt;/ref&gt;,([[Padma Shri]], 2005)&lt;ref&gt;http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmashri_awards_list1.php?start=470&lt;/ref&gt;, took over on January 1, 1989, and continued until December 9, 2007. He is currently chief editor of the [[Malayala Manorama]] daily, the group's flagship publication.
Currently, THE WEEK does not have a chief editor. K.M. Mathew's second son, Philip Mathew, managing editor since January 1, 1989, is the highest-ranked editor.

=== Publishers ===

* Jacob Mathew: January 1, 1989 till date. K.M. Mathew's third son, he is currently president of WAN-IFRA. He is the second Asian and the first Indian to hold the post&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindu.com/2011/04/10/stories/2011041055231300.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Editors ===
The magazine has had two editors, after which the designation was discontinued.
* V.K.B. Nair: December 26, 1982 to June 3, 1984.
* [[T.V.R. Shenoy]] ([[Padma Bhushan]], 2003)&lt;ref&gt;http://hindu.com/2003/01/26/stories/2003012605060100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;: June 10, 1984 to December 11, 1988.

=== Editor-in-Charge ===
Currently, the editor-in-charge is responsible for selection of news under The Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867. The incumbent editor-in-charge, T R Gopaalakrishnan, took over on December 18, 1988.

== Design and style ==
The magazine was initially designed in-house, and was periodically redesigned. A major content overhaul was led by Peter Lim, author and former editor-in-chief of [[The Straits Times]]/[[Singapore Press Holdings]]. He authored the book Chronicle of Singapore: Fifty Years of Headline News&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kinokuniya.com.sg/whatson_events_chronicleofsg.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

The two major redesigns were led by:
* Peter Ong&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trends-in-newsrooms.org/articles.php?id=34&lt;/ref&gt; on November 8, 1998.
* [[Mario Garcia|Dr Mario R. Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://garciamedia.com/about/bio/dr_mario_r_garcia&lt;/ref&gt; on February 20, 2005.

Based in [[Sydney]], Australia, Ong&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifra.com/WebSite/IFRAEvent.nsf/wuis/D45987F2BAFDF38E482570B60012CF39?OpenDocument&amp;CS&amp;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://peterong.com/blog/&lt;/ref&gt;was formerly Picture &amp; Graphics Editor of [[The Straits Times]]. He is principal consultant at Checkout Australia, and was regional director for the Society of News Design. Garcia owns the premier newspaper design firm, Garcia Media&lt;ref&gt;http://garciamedia.com/&lt;/ref&gt;. Both of them also helped redesign the [[Malayala Manorama]].

In the early years, cartoonist [[Mario Miranda]] designed many covers for THE WEEK. He also had a regular pocket cartoon in the magazine.

THE WEEK does not have published stylebook, but generally follows the down style for capitalisation&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.co.in/books?id=fnhkJ_CjTQIC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=down+style+capitalization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7_Sg8cWtL1&amp;sig=_8MXa69RsktYVLL2luzJEjC4E0o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GtufTtaHIeeNiAegnsnsBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=down%20style%20capitalization&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;. Its dateline carries the [[pull date]], not the date of issue.
