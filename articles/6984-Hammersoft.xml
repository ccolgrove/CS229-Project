==Military career==
Powell described joining the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) during college as one of the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had &quot;found himself.&quot; According to Powell: &lt;blockquote&gt;âIt was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on.â &lt;ref&gt;[http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/pow0int-1 Biography and Video Interview of Colin Powell at Academy of Achievement.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Officer cadet|Cadet]] Powell joined the [[Pershing Rifles]], the ROTC fraternal organization and [[Military Drill Team|drill team]] begun by General [[John Pershing]].

He was charged with investigating a detailed letter by Tom Glen (a soldier from the [[11th Light Infantry Brigade]]), which backed up rumored allegations of the [[My Lai Massacre]]. Powell wrote: &quot;In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the [[Vietnamese people]] are excellent.&quot; Later, Powell's assessment would be described as [[Whitewash (censorship)|whitewash]]ing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004 Powell said to [[Larry King]], &quot;I mean, I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened. So, in war, these sorts of horrible things happen every now and again, but they are still to be deplored.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Powell.JPEG|150px|thumb|left|Powell as [[Commanding General, United States Army Forces Command|Commanding General]], [[FORSCOM]]]]

Powell served a [[White House fellowship]], a highly selective and prestigious position, under President [[Richard Nixon]] from 1972 to 1973.

In his autobiography, ''My American Journey'', Powell named several officers he served under who inspired and mentored him. As a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] serving in South Korea, Powell was very close to General [[Henry &quot;Gunfighter&quot; Emerson]]. Powell said he regarded Emerson as one of the most caring officers he ever met. Emerson was reputedly eccentric; he insisted his troops train only at night and made them repeatedly watch the television film ''[[Brian's Song]]'' to promote racial harmony. Powell always professed that what set Emerson apart, was his great love of his soldiers and concern for their welfare.

In the early 1980s, Powell served at [[Fort Carson, Colorado]]. After he left Fort Carson, Powell became senior military assistant to [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Caspar Weinberger]], whom he assisted during the [[Invasion of Grenada|1983 invasion of Grenada]] and the [[1986 Bombing of Libya|1986 airstrike on Libya]].

In 1986, he took over the command of V Corps in [[Frankfurt, Germany]], from [[Robert Lewis &quot;Sam&quot; Wetzel]]. Following the [[Iran Contra]] scandal, Powell became [[Ronald Reagan]]'s National Security Advisor, serving from 1987 to 1989. In April 1989, Powell was promoted to General and briefly served as the [[Commanding General, United States Army Forces Command|Commander in Chief]], [[United States Army Forces Command|Forces Command]], headquartered at [[Fort McPherson, Georgia]]. Later that year, President George H.W. Bush selected him as Chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/inauguration/transition/powell.html |title=Online NewsHour: Colin Powell |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 49, Powell became [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]], serving from 1987 to 1989 while retaining his Army commission as a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]]. After his tenure with the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], Powell was promoted to a full [[General (United States)|general]] under President [[George H.W.

At age 52, he became the youngest officer, and first [[Afro-Caribbean American]], to serve in this position. In 1989, he joined [[Dwight D.

During this time, he oversaw 28 crises, including the [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]] in 1989 to remove General [[Manuel Noriega]] from power and [[Operation Desert Storm]] in the 1991 [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. During these events, Powell earned his nickname, &quot;the reluctant warrior.&quot; He rarely advocated military intervention as the first solution to an [[international crisis]], and instead usually prescribed [[diplomacy]] and [[containment]].

In his autobiography, Powell said he is haunted by the nightmare of the Vietnam War and felt that the leadership was very ineffective. Powell served a tour in Vietnam as a military adviser, and was mildly injured when he stepped on a bamboo &quot;[[punji stick]]&quot;. The large infection made it difficult for him to walk, and caused his foot to swell for a short time, shortening his first tour. It was also during his Vietnam service, his second tour, that Powell was decorated for bravery. He single-handedly rescued several men from a burning [[helicopter]], one of them being Maj. Gen. Charles Gettys, the commander of the [[Americal Division]].

Additionally, Powell has been critical of other instances of [[U.S. foreign policy]] in the past, such as its support for the [[1973 Chilean coup d'Ã©tat]]. From two separate interviews in 2003, Powell stated in one about the 1973 event &quot;I can't justify or explain the actions and decisions that were made at that time. It was a different time. There was a great deal of concern about communism in this part of the world. Communism was a threat to the [[democracy|democracies]] in this part of the world. It was a threat to the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/news/2003/02/dos022003.html |title=Remarks at the 2003 Groundhog Job Shadow Day Program, Secretary Colin L.

As a [[military strategist]], Powell has advocated an approach to military conflicts that maximizes the potential for success and minimizes casualties. A component of this approach is the use of overwhelming force, which he applied to Operation Desert Storm in 1991. His approach has been dubbed the &quot;[[Powell Doctrine]]&quot;.

==Potential candidate==
Powell's experience in military matters made him a very popular figure with both American political parties. Many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] admired his moderate stance on military matters, while many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] saw him as a great asset associated with the successes of past Republican administrations. Put forth as a potential Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 U.S. Presidential Election]]&lt;ref name=PowellasDemVP&gt;

As [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the Bush administration, Powell was perceived as moderate. Powell was unanimously voted in by the [[United States Senate]]. Over the course of his tenure he traveled less than any other U.S. Secretary of State in 30 years.

On September 11, 2001, Powell was in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], meeting with President [[Alejandro Toledo]] and [[US Ambassador]] John Hamilton, and attending the special session of the [[General Assembly of the Organization of American States|OAS General Assembly]] that subsequently adopted the [[Inter-American Democratic Charter]]. After the [[September 11 attacks]], Powell's job became of critical importance in managing America's relationships with foreign countries in order to secure a stable coalition in the [[War on Terrorism]].

Powell came under fire for his role in [[Rationale for the Iraq War|building the case]] for the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. In a press statement on February 24, 2001 he had said that [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against Iraq had prevented the development of any [[weapons of mass destruction]] by [[Saddam Hussein]]. As was the case in the days leading up to the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], Powell was initially opposed to a forcible overthrow of Saddam, preferring to continue a policy of containment. However, Powell eventually agreed to go along with the Bush administration's determination to remove Saddam. He had often clashed with others in the administration, who were reportedly planning an Iraq invasion even before the September 11 attacks, an insight supported by testimony by former terrorism czar [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] in front of the [[9/11 Commission]]. The main concession Powell wanted before he would offer his full support for the Iraq War was the involvement of the international community in the invasion, as opposed to a [[Unilateralism|unilateral approach]]. He was also successful in persuading Bush to take the case of Iraq to the United Nations, and in moderating other initiatives. Powell was placed at the forefront of this diplomatic campaign.

[[File:Powell-anthrax-vial.jpg|thumb|Colin Powell holding a [[2001 anthrax attack|model vial of anthrax]] while giving a presentation to the [[United Nations Security Council]]]]

Powell's chief role was to [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war|garner international support]] for a multi-national [[coalition]] to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell [[United_Nations_Security_Council_and_the_Iraq_War#Colin_Powell.27s_presentation|addressed a plenary session]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]] on February 5, 2003 to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that &quot;there can be no doubt that Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more.&quot;&lt;ref name=UNSC_Powell_20030205&gt;

Most observers praised Powell's oratorical skills. However, [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' reported soon afterwards that a [[Iraq Dossier|UK intelligence dossier]] that Powell had referred to as a &quot;fine paper&quot; during his presentation had been based on old material and [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] an essay by American graduate student [[Ibrahim al-Marashi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/529|title=U.S. Scholar Uncredited in Iraq Report|last=Lawless|first=Jill|date=February 7, 2003|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN_20030207&gt;

A 2004 report by the [[Iraq Survey Group]] concluded that the evidence that Powell offered to support the allegation that the Iraqi government possessed [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) was inaccurate.

A Senate report on intelligence failures would later detail the intense debate that went on behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the [[yellowcake forgery]].&lt;ref name=LAT_Miller_20040715&gt;

Because Powell was seen as more moderate than most figures in the administration, he was spared many of the attacks that have been leveled at more controversial advocates of the invasion, such as [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[Paul Wolfowitz]]. At times, infighting among the Powell-led State Department, the Rumsfeld-led Defense Department, and Cheney's office had the effect of polarizing the administration on crucial issues, such as what actions to take regarding [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].

After Saddam Hussein had been deposed, Powell's new role was to once again establish a working international coalition, this time to assist in the rebuilding of post-war Iraq.

Claiming that he was unaware that some intelligence officials questioned the information prior to his presentation, Powell pushed for reform in the intelligence community, including the creation of a national intelligence director who would assure that &quot;what one person knew, everyone else knew.&quot;

Powell announced his resignation as Secretary of State on November 15, 2004. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', he had been asked to resign by the president's chief of staff, [[Andrew Card]].&lt;ref name=DeYoung2006/&gt; Powell announced that he would stay on until the end of Bush's first term or until his replacement's confirmation by Congress. The following day, Bush nominated National Security Advisor [[Condoleezza Rice]] as Powell's successor. News of Powell's leaving the Administration spurred mixed reactions from politicians around the world&amp;nbsp;â some upset at the loss of a statesman seen as a moderating factor within the Bush administration, but others hoping for Powell's successor to wield more influence within the cabinet.

In mid-November, Powell stated that he had seen new evidence suggesting that [[Iran]] was adapting missiles for a nuclear delivery system.&lt;ref name=NYT_Sciolino_20041118&gt;

On April 28, 2005, an opinion piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by [[Sidney Blumenthal]] (a former top aide to President [[Bill Clinton]]) claimed that Powell was in fact &quot;conducting a campaign&quot; against Bolton because of the acrimonious battles they had had while working together, which among other things had resulted in Powell cutting Bolton out of talks with Iran and [[Libya]] after complaints about Bolton's involvement from the British. Blumenthal added that &quot;The foreign relations committee has discovered that Bolton made a highly unusual request and gained access to 10 intercepts by the [[National Security Agency]].

On January 5, 2006, he participated in a meeting at the [[White House]] of former Secretaries of Defense and State to discuss United States foreign policy with Bush administration officials. In September 2006, Powell sided with more moderate Senate Republicans in supporting more rights for detainees and opposing President Bush's [[terrorism]] bill. He backed Senators [[John Warner]], [[John McCain]] and [[Lindsey Graham]] in their statement that U.S. military and intelligence personnel in future wars will suffer for abuses committed in 2006 by the U.S. in the name of fighting terrorism.

In 2008, Powell served as a spokesperson for [[National Mentoring Month]], a campaign held each January to recruit volunteer mentors for at-risk youth.&lt;ref name=mentor2008&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

Soon after [[Barack Obama]]'s [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 election]], Powell began being mentioned as a possible [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]] member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2008/11/11/al-gore-colin-powell-caroline-kennedy-in-obamas-administration.html |title=Al Gore, Colin Powell, Caroline Kennedy in Obama's Administration? - Washington Whispers |publisher=usnews.com |date=November 11, 2008 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not nominated.

In September 2009, Powell advised President Obama against surging US forces in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Powell advised against Afghan surge,&quot; Politico (9/27/2009). http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/0909/Powell_advised_against_Afghan_surge.html&lt;/ref&gt; The president announced the surge the following December.

==Political views==
A moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Powell is well known for his willingness to support [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] or centrist causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;&gt;[http://www.ontheissues.org/Colin_Powell.htm Colin Powell's biography from] [http://www.issues2000.org/default.htm 'On The Issues'].&lt;/ref&gt; He is [[pro-choice]] regarding [[abortion]], and in favor of &quot;reasonable&quot; [[gun control]].&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;/&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2011}} He stated in his autobiography that he supports [[affirmative action]] that levels the playing field, without giving a leg up to undeserving persons because of racial issues. Powell was also instrumental in the 1993 implementation of the military's [[don't ask, don't tell]] policy,&lt;ref name=&quot;issues&quot;/&gt; though he later supported its repeal as proposed by [[Robert Gates]] and Admiral [[Mike Mullen]] in January 2010, saying &quot;circumstances had changed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Colin Powell shifts stance on 'don't ask, don't tell' policy |author=DeYoung, Karen |date=February 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/03/AR2010020302292.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnam War had a profound effect on Powell's views of the proper use of military force. These views are described in detail in the autobiography ''My American Journey''. The [[Powell Doctrine]], as the views became known, was a central component of US policy in the [[Gulf War]] (the first U.S. war in Iraq) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] (the overthrow of the [[Taliban]] regime in [[Afghanistan]] following the [[September 11 attacks]]). The hallmark of both operations was strong international cooperation, and the use of overwhelming military force.

Powell was the subject of controversy in 2004 when, in a conversation with [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]], he reportedly referred to [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]] within the Bush administration as &quot;fucking crazies.&quot;&lt;ref name=Guardian_Blumenthal_20041118&gt;

In a September 2006 letter to Sen. [[John McCain]], General Powell expressed opposition to President Bush's push for [[Guantanamo military commission|military tribunals]] of those formerly and currently classified as [[enemy combatants]]. Specifically, he objected to the effort in Congress to &quot;redefine Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention.&quot; He also asserted: &quot;The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sen. McCain Releases Letter from Gen. Colin Powell,&quot; Washington Post (September 14, 2006). http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/graphic/2006/09/14/GR2006091400728.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===View of the U.S. war in Iraq===
While Powell was wary of a military solution, he supported the decision to invade Iraq after the administration concluded the diplomatic track had failed. After his departure from the State Department, Powell repeatedly emphasized his continued support for the war.

At the 2007 Aspen Ideas Festival in [[Colorado]],&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.aifestival.org/ Official website: Aspen Ideas Festival ]&lt;/ref&gt; Powell revealed that he had spent two and a half hours explaining to President Bush &quot;the consequences of going into an Arab country and becoming the occupiers.&quot; During this discussion, he insisted that the US appeal to the United Nations first, but if diplomacy failed, he would support the invasion: &quot;I also had to say to him that you are the President, you will have to make the ultimate judgment, and if the judgment is this isn't working and we don't think it is going to solve the problem, then if military action is undertaken I'm with you, I support you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=February 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 interview on [[CNN]], Powell reiterated his support for the 2003 decision to invade Iraq in the context of his endorsement of [[Barack Obama]], stating: &quot;My role has been very, very straightforward. I wanted to avoid a war. The president [Bush] agreed with me. We tried to do that. We couldn't get it through the U.N. and when the president made the decision, I supported that decision. And I've never blinked from that. I've never said I didn't support a decision to go to war.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;edition.cnn.com&quot;&gt;&quot;Powell: Support for Obama doesn't mean Iraq war wrong,&quot; CNN (October 19, 2008). http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/19/powell.transcript/&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell's position on the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] has been less clear. In December 2006, he expressed skepticism that the strategy would work and whether the US had enough troops to carry it out successfully. He stated: &quot;I am not persuaded that another surge of troops into Baghdad for the purposes of suppressing this communitarian violence, this civil war, will work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James M. Klatell, &quot;Powell: We Are Losing In Iraq,&quot; CBS (December 17, 2006). http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/12/17/ftn/main2274583.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Following his endorsement of [[Barack Obama]] in October 2008, however, Powell praised [[David Petraeus|General David Petraeus]] and US troops, as well as the Iraqi government, concluding that &quot;it's starting to turn around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;edition.cnn.com&quot;/&gt; By mid-2009, he had concluded a surge of US forces in Iraq should have come sooner, perhaps in late 2003.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Powell says Iraq surge should have come earlier,&quot; Seattle Times (July 5, 2009). http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2009420450_apuspowell.html&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, Powell consistently argued that Iraqi political progress was essential, not just military force.

===Role in presidential election of 2008===
Powell donated the maximum allowable amount to [[John McCain]]'s campaign in the summer of 2007&lt;ref name=CNN_Henry_20070809&gt;

He also added that he was &quot;troubled&quot; by the &quot;false intimations that Obama was [[Muslim]].&quot; Powell stated that &quot;[Obama] is a Christian&amp;nbsp;â he's always been a Christian... But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer's no, that's not America.&quot; Powell then referenced [[Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan]], a [[List of North American Muslims|Muslim American]] soldier in the [[U.S. Army]] who served and died in the Iraq War. He later stated, &quot;Over the last seven weeks, the approach of the Republican Party has become narrower and narrower [...] I look at these kind of approaches to the campaign, and they trouble me.&quot;&lt;ref name=obamaendorse&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; Powell concluded his [[Sunday morning talk show]] comments, &quot;It isn't easy for me to disappoint Sen. McCain in the way that I have this morning, and I regret that [...] I think we need a [[transformational figure]]. I think we need a president who is a [[generational change]] and that's why I'm supporting Barack Obama, not out of any lack of respect or admiration for Sen.

*The Coat of Arms of Colin Powell was granted by the [[Lord Lyon]] in [[Edinburgh]] on February 4, 2004. Technically the grant was to Powell's father (a British subject) to be passed on by descent. Scotland's [[King of Arms]] is traditionally responsible for granting arms to Commonwealth citizens of Scottish descent. Blazoned as:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Azure, two swords in saltire points downwards between four mullets Argent, on a chief of the Second a lion passant Gules. On a wreath of the Liveries is set for Crest the head of an American bald-headed eagle erased Proper. And in an escrol over the same this motto, &quot;DEVOTED TO PUBLIC SERVICE.&quot;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;The swords and stars refer to the former general's career, as does the crest, which is the badge of the 101st Airborne (which he served as a brigade commander in the mid-1970s). The lion may be an allusion to Scotland. The shield can be shown surrounded by the insignia of an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Honorable [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB), an award the General received after the first Gulf War.
*In 2005 Powell received the [[Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award]] for his contributions to Africa.
