'''CBN''' is an [[Australia]]n [[television station]] licensed to, and serving the regions surrounding [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and [[Dubbo]] in central western [[New South Wales]].

==History==
===Origins===
CBN-8 Orange commenced broadcasting on March 17, 1962, licensed to ''Country Broadcasting Services'', owners of local radio station [[2GZ]]. They soon changed their name to [[Country Television Services]]. CWN-6 Dubbo began transmission on December 1, 1965. Also owned by CTS, they became the first station to completely relay another station's programming, although some station identification, such as test patterns, remained separate.

In 1968, the stations acquired access to the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster-General]]'s microwave link, allowing viewers to see national news programs and other major events live for the first time. By the early 1970s, the stations began' to run into financial difficulties, and it was decided to enter into a joint programming agreement with [[MTN-9]] of [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]], resulting in the formation of the ''Midstate 6-8-9'' network (later ''Midstate Television 6-8-9'').

A 30-minute [[documentary film|documentary]] on the 1978 [[National Rodeo Titles]], called ''Goin' Down The Road'', won the station the 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station' [[Logie Award]] in 1979. Local programming in the 1980s included ''Focus'', ''Rural Roundup'', ''Early Shift'', ''Weekend Report'', ''Time to Live'', ''Around The Schools'','' and coverage of local special events.

Local sports coverage, especially of [[tennis]] and [[rugby football|rugby]], former a major part of the schedule in the late 1970s and early 1980s. From 1979, the station sponsored, and telecast the [[United Permanent Tennis Tournament]], the only tournament of its kind in Australia.

With [[Regional television in Australia#Aggregation|aggregation]] looming, CBN and CWN were purchased by health care magnate [[Paul Ramsay]]'s Ramcorp Ltd in 1987, and merged with [[AMV (TV station)|RVN/AMV]] to form ''The Prime Network'', in November 1988. Local programming and staff levels were reduced - morale at the time was reported to be at ''an all time low''. Programming schedules began to resemble those of  affiliation partner [[Seven Network|Seven]], with new facilities built in [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]] and [[Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|Canberra]] in preparation for the expansion in coverage area.

=== Aggregation ===
When aggreation in southern New South Wales occurred in 1989, CBN and CWN were effectively merged into one station, CBN, branded on-air as ''Prime Television''. The station then moved into the rest of the new license area, competing against [[WIN Television]] and [[CTC (TV station)|10 Capital]]. The introduction of the two new stations into Orange was delayed by technical problems, and did not start in the area until later in the year.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}

In 1991, the Wagga Wagga and Orange licenses were merged into the one license, with [[AMV (TV station)|RVN]] taking on the CBN callsign.

== Prime7 News ==
CBN produces and broadcasts a live 30-minute ''Prime7 News'' bulletin for the Orange regional market, each weeknight at 6pm. ''Prime7 News Orange'' is presented by Hugh Whitfeld with Amy Williams as sports presenter.

In the Wollongong and Canberra regional markets, short two-minute updates are presented on a rotating basis by Natalie Forrest and Renee Bogatko with weather forecasts from Daniel Gibson and Madelaine Collingnon. Weekend weather forecasts for the North Coast of New South Wales are presented by Craig Moore.

Effective August 2010, production of Prime7 News for the Orange and Wagga Wagga markets have been moved to Prime7's Canberra headquarters. The two bulletins will alternate between live transmission and being pre-recorded. The move is expected to see the two bulletins produced in widescreen for the first time.
