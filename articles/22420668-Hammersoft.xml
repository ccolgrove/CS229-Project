'''Marilyn Chambers''' (April 22, 1952 â April 12, 2009) was an [[Americans|American]] [[pornographic actor|pornographic actress]], exotic dancer, model, actress and vice-presidential candidate. She was best known for her 1972 [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] film debut ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' and her 1980 pornographic film ''[[Insatiable (1980 film)|Insatiable]]''.

==Early life==
Born Marilyn Ann Briggs &lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;[[Weber, Bruce|Bruce Weber]], &quot;http://movies.msn.com/wonderwall/in-memoriam-2009/photo-gallery/feature/?photoidx=32''[[The New York Times]]'', April 14, 2009, reports that at her death, Ed Winter, assistant chief of the [[Los Angeles County]] [[coroner]]'s office, gave her name as Marilyn Ann Taylor, &quot;evidently the name she assumed after a marriage,&quot; and that &quot;he could not confirm that her birth name was, as often reported, Marilyn Ann Briggs&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Providence, Rhode Island]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doubet|first=Phil |title=My Pryor Year: A 333 Soul Anthology|publisher=iUniverse|year=2006|pages=120|isbn=0-595-39157-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projo.com/news/content/PROVIDENCE_NATIVE_MARILYN_CHAMBE_04-14-09_NVE_v17.325e19b.html Morgan, Thomas J. &quot;Providence-born porn star Marilyn Chambers dies at 54,&quot; ''The Providence Journal'', Tuesday, April 14, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Westport, Connecticut]]&lt;ref name=westport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westportnow.com/index.php?/v2/comments/23202/|title=Adult Film Star Marilyn Chambers, Ex-Westporter, Dies at 56|date=2009-04-13|publisher=westportnow.com|accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[middle-class]] household. It is often reported that she was born in Westport, however in a 2007 interview Chambers confirmed she was born in Providence but grew up in Westport.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; Her father was in advertising and her mother was a nurse. She was the youngest of three children, including a brother, Martin Briggs (keyboardist for 1960s Boston Band, The Remains), and a sister, Jann Smith.&lt;ref name=westport /&gt; Chambers attended Burr Farms Elementary School, Hillspoint Elementary School, Long Lots Junior High School, and [[Staples High School]].&lt;ref name=westport/&gt; Her father tried to discourage her from pursuing a modeling career, citing brutal competition. Chambers said in 2005, &quot;When I was about 16 I learned how to write my motherâs name on notes to get out of school. And then I'd take the train into the city to go to auditions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Hollywood: The Uncensored Oral History of the Porn Film Industry'', cited in WestportNow.com&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative while in high school landed her some modeling assignments and a small role in the film ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)|The Owl and the Pussycat]]'' (1970), which starred [[Barbra Streisand]]&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; and in which Chambers was credited as Evelyn Lang.

==Career==
She moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] for more work. She did not receive any roles except for a low-budget film, writer-director-producer [[Sean S. Cunningham]]'s ''[[Together (1971 film)|Together]]'' (1971), in which she appeared nude. She left Los Angeles for [[San Francisco, California]], where she held several jobs that included topless model and a bottomless dancer. During her early career her most visible modeling job was as the &quot;Ivory soap girl&quot; on the [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory Snow]] soap box, posing as a mother holding a baby under the tag line &quot;99 &amp; 44/100% pure&quot;.&lt;ref name=unknown/&gt;&lt;ref name=falk/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=love/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/risque/porn/chambers.htm Marilyn Chambers and Ivory Snow], snopes.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hardcore&gt;{{cite book|title=Hard core: power, pleasure, and the &quot;frenzy of the visible&quot;|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|author=Williams, Linda |year=1999|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3wAe48_yfNUC|isbn=0520219430|pages=156â158|authorlink=Linda Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chambers saw an advertisement in the [[San Francisco Chronicle]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubner&quot;&gt;John Hubner, ''Bottom Feeders'', Dell (1994), pp. 166&lt;/ref&gt; for a casting call and rushed to the audition, only to find it was for a [[pornographic film]], ''[[Behind the Green Door]]''. She was about to leave when producers [[Mitchell Brothers|Artie and Jim Mitchell]] noticed her resemblance to [[Cybill Shepherd]]. They invited her upstairs to their offices and told her the plot of the film. Chambers was highly dubious about accepting a role in a pornographic film fearing it might ruin her chances at breaking into the mainstream. But she was turned on by the fantasy of the story and decided to take a chance, under the condition that she receive a hefty salary and 10% of the film's gross. She also insisted that each actor get tested for venereal disease. The Mitchell Brothers balked at her request for a percentage of the film's profits, but finally agreed realizing a wholesome blond actress was needed for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubner&quot;&gt;pp. 167-178&lt;/ref&gt; 

After filming concluded, she informed them that she was &quot;the Ivory Snow Girl&quot;; the Mitchells capitalized on this by billing her as the &quot;99 and 44/100% pure&quot; girl.&lt;ref name=unknown&gt;{{cite book|title=San Francisco: The Unknown City|publisher=[[Arsenal Pulp Press]]|author=Helene Goupil, Josh Krist |year=2005|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pXAsU1sQG1AC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=1551521881|pages=238â241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she said at the time that the film would help &quot;sell a lot more soap&quot;, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] quickly dropped her after discovering her double life as an adult-film actress,&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; and the advertising industry was scandalized.&lt;ref name=Hardcore/&gt; The fact that Chambers image was so well known from Ivory Snow boosted the film's ticket sales, and led to several jokes on television talk shows.&lt;ref name=love&gt;{{cite book|title=Make love, not war: the sexual revolution, an unfettered history|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|author=David Smith Allyn |year=2001|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NE9lfn0FBHUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0415929423|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly every adult film she made following this incident featured a cameo of her Ivory Snow box.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hubner&quot;&gt;pp. 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusually, Chambers does not have a single word of dialogue in the entire film.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; After engaging in lesbian sex with a group of women, she has sex with the [[African-American]] boxer [[Johnny Keyes]].&lt;ref name=Hardcore/&gt; This possibly makes ''BTGD'' the first U.S. feature-length [[Hardcore pornography|hardcore]] film to include an interracial sex scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Porn studies|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|author=Williams, Linda |year=2004|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rdWZ8JD5dkkC|isbn=0822333120|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The porn industry and viewing public were shocked by the then-taboo spectacle of a white woman having sex with a black man. Chambers was relatively unknown prior to ''BTGD''; however, the film made her a star.&lt;ref name=falk&gt;{{cite book|title=The consuming body|publisher=[[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]|author=Falk, Pasi |year=1994|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yo2Sz_9rjkQC|isbn=0803989741|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of organized crime in the United States|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|author=Robert J. Kelly, Ko-lin Chin, Rufus Schatzberg |year=1994|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CWg1Efv5C5UC|isbn=0313283664|pages=301â302}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Green Door'', along with ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'', released the same year, and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'', ushered in what is commonly known as the [[porno chic]] era. Critics have since debated whether she was really having orgasms in her scenes or just acting. She stated in one early interview that they were real, but denied it in an interview many years later.&lt;ref name=falk/&gt;

Following ''Behind the Green Door'', the Mitchell Brothers and Chambers teamed up for ''Resurrection of Eve'' which was released in September 1973. A documentary by the brothers called ''Inside Marilyn Chambers'' was released in 1976. Chambers wrote an autobiography, ''My Story'', in 1975, and co-authored ''Xaviera Meets Marilyn Chambers'' with [[Xaviera Hollander]] in 1977. Both were published by Warner Communications.

Chambers dreamed of having a career in non-porn, mainstream endeavors. In 1974 she starred in the dinner theater production of &quot;Mind With the Dirty Man&quot; in Las Vegas and later starred in [[Neil Simon]]'s &quot;Last of the Red Hot Lovers.&quot; The one-woman show &quot;Sex Surrogate&quot;, in 1979, caused controversy in Vegas as it featured full-frontal nudity, which at the time was banned from all casinos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lvrj.com/news/breaking_news/42937007.html Las Vegas Review Journal, &quot;Adult film star Marilyn Chambers dies at 56; Las Vegas ties numerous&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Chambers won the starring role in [[film director]] [[David Cronenberg]]'s low-budget [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian movie]] ''[[Rabid]]'', which was released in 1977.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|id=0076590|title=Rabid}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to hardcore pornographic films with ''[[Insatiable (1980 film)|Insatiable]]'', which was the top-selling adult video in the U.S. from 1980-1982.&lt;ref&gt;Williams (1999), p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent porn films included ''Up 'n' Coming'' (1983) and ''Insatiable II'' (1984). She still hoped to launch a successful mainstream acting career, but was unable to do so.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

In a 2004 interview, Chambers said &quot;My advice to somebody who wants to go into adult films is: Absolutely not! It's heart-breaking. It leaves you kind of empty. So have a day job and don't quit it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/C/Chambers_Marilyn/2004/06/05/757225.html Kirkland, Bruce, &quot;Inside Chambers&quot;], Jam! Showbiz, June 5, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independent films==
Near the end of her career, Chambers appeared primarily in [[independent film]]s, including her last role in ''[[Solitaire (film)|Solitaire]]''. Chambers claimed that the more laid-back pace of these roles suited her as &quot;there's a lot less pressure on you to perform [and] you don't have to be young and skinny.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Foster, Rick |title=Ex-porn star Marilyn Chambers in local indie film |url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/articles/2007/07/24/news/news1.txt|accessdate=2007-07-24|date=2007-07-23|publisher=[[The Sun Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were ''Bikini Bistro'', ''Angel of Heat'' (with [[Mary Woronov]]), ''[[Rated X (film)|Rated X]]'', ''Party Incorporated'', and ''Breakfast in Bed''.

==Singing career==
Chambers had some chart success with the disco single &quot;Benihana&quot; in 1976, produced by [[Michael Zager]] on the [[Roulette Records]] label.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002368.html?categoryId=25&amp;cs=1 &quot;Porn star Marilyn Chambers dies&quot;, ''Variety'', Monday, April 13, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts in politics==
In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 United States presidential election]], Chambers ran for Vice President on the [[Personal Choice Party]] ticket, a quasi-[[Libertarianism|libertarian]] party. She received a total of 946 votes. In the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]], she was again [[Charles Jay]]'s running mate, this time as an alternate [[write-in candidate]] to his primary national [[Boston Tea Party (political party)|Boston Tea Party]] running mate [[Thomas L. Knapp]] in the states of Arkansas, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostontea.us/voterguide Boston Tea Party Voter Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://marilyn.personalchoice.org/ Official vice-presidential campaign site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On April 12, 2009, Chambers was found dead in her home near [[Santa Clarita, California]].&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Movies/04/13/obit.chambers/index.html?iref=24hours|title=Porn star Marilyn Chambers dies at 56|last=Duke|first=Alan|date=2009-04-19|publisher=edition.cnn.com|accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Documents found with her body identified her as Marilyn Ann Taylor, presumably the name she assumed after a marriage.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt; She was discovered by her 17-year-old daughter, McKenna Marie Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLellan |first=Dennis |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-marilyn-chambers14-2009apr14,0,2571017.story |title=Marilyn Chambers dies at 56; '70s porn star and Ivory Snow model |work=Los Angeles Times |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2009-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coroner]]'s [[autopsy]] revealed that Chambers died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and an [[aneurysm]] related to [[heart disease]]. Chambers was ten days away from her 57th birthday. Painkiller [[hydrocodone]] ([[Vicodin]]) and anti-depressant [[Citalopram]] were found in her bloodstream but not enough to cause death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090518/en_nm/us_chambers_1|title=Porn star Marilyn Chambers died of heart disease|date=2009-05-19|accessdate=2009-05-15}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her death the Associated Press reported that she was survived by her daughter, sister, and brother.&lt;ref name=nytobit/&gt;

==Fictional portrayal==
In 2000, [[Tracy Hutson]] played Chambers in the cable television [[biographical film]] ''[[Rated X (film)|Rated&amp;nbsp;X]]'', about the Mitchell brothers' film and strip-club career.
