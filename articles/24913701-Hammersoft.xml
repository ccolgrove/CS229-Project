The '''2009â10 Ivy League men's basketball season''' marks the 107th season of [[Ivy League]] [[basketball]].

==Preseason==
The Ivy League held its pre-season media day on October 28, 2009 in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].  The league's media unanimously voted [[Cornell Big Red men's basketball|Cornell]] the preseason #1 for the second straight season.  Cornell returned all five starters, three all-conference performers, and the Ivy League rookie and defensive players of the year from the 2009 Ivy League championship team&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/article.asp?intID=7407 Cornell Unanimously Picked by Media to Three-peat], [[Ivy League]], retrieved 2009-10-31&lt;/ref&gt;.

Two Ivy League seniors were named preseason candidates for the [[Lowe's Senior CLASS Award]].  [[Columbia Lions|Columbia's]] Patrick Foley and [[Brown Bears|Brown's]] Matthew Mullery were named to the 30-man preseason list&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seniorclassaward.com/news/view/lowes_senior_class_award_names_2009-10_mens_and_womens_basketball_candidate/ Loweâs Senior CLASS Award Names 2009â10 Menâs and Womenâs Basketball Candidates], [[Lowe's Senior CLASS Award]], retrieved 2009-11-05&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Regular season==
===Non-conference===
Preseason #1 Cornell lived up to its billing by scoring the first Ivy League win over one of the six major conferences as the Big Red beat the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC's]] [[Alabama Crimson Tide]] 71â67 in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]], behind Ryan Wittman's 23 points.  It was Cornell's first win over a current SEC member school since the Big Red defeated [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]] (then a part of the [[Southwest Conference]]) during the 1972â73 season&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293180333 Cornell 71, Alabama 67] ''ESPN.com'' Retrieved on November 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Harvard Crimson|Harvard]] also got off to a fast start.  After winning their opener against [[Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball|Holy Cross]], the Crimson won a triple-overtime contest over the [[William &amp; Mary Tribe men's basketball|College of William &amp; Mary]], 87â85 on a half-court shot by senior guard [[Jeremy Lin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scores.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293190108 Harvard 87, William &amp; Mary 85] ''ESPN.com'' Retrieved on November 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Lin also made headlines in early December as he scored 30 points in a close loss (79â73) at #14 [[2009â10 Connecticut Huskies men's basketball team|Connecticut]], then came back to score 25 in the Crimson's very next game â a 74â67 upset of [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]].  Lin started the New Year by being named to the Mid-season [[Wooden Award]] 30-man watch list&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocrimson.com/sports/mbkb/2009-10/releases/100104_Wooden_Award Lin Named John R. Wooden Award Midseason Top 30 Candidate] ''gocrimson.com'' Retrieved on January 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bob Cousy Award]].

The Ivy made news for some not-so positive reasons as the conference saw two coaches fired during the pre-conference slate.  [[Penn Quakers men's basketball|Penn]] fired coach [[Glen Miller (basketball coach)|Glen Miller]] after an 0â7 start, while [[Dartmouth Big Green|Dartmouth's]] Terry Dunn resigned after a 3â10 start.

But the biggest press of the non-conference season for the Ivy League came on January 6, as league favorite Cornell led #1 and undefeated [[2009â10 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] with under a minute remaining at [[Allen Fieldhouse]].  Ultimately, the Big Red lost to KU 71â66, but the Ivy stalwarts proved that they could compete with the top teams&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/gamecast?gameId=300062305 Collins scores 33 as Jayhawks get by scrappy Big Red] ''ESPN.com'' Retrieved on January 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conference season===
Cornell and Harvard were expected to compete for the league title, but the Big Red swept the Crimson.  However, Penn stopped Cornell's bid for a perfect Ivy League season by beating the then 22nd ranked Big Red 79â64 at the [[Palestra]] in [[Philadelphia]].  The win snapped an eight-game win streak by Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=300430219 Penn snaps No. 22 Cornell's 8-game win streak]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conference awards &amp; honors==
===All-Conference teams===
At the conclusion of the season, the Ivy League all-conference teams were selected.  Cornell placed a trio of seniors â Ryan Wittman, Jeff Foote and Louis Dale â on the All-Ivy first team.  The Big Red threesome were joined on the first team by Harvard's Jeremy Lin and Penn's Zack Rosen.  Wittman and Foote were the Ivy League player and defensive players of the year, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/article.asp?intID=7629 All-Ivy Men's Basketball â 2009â10]&lt;/ref&gt;
