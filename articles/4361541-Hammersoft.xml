===Other work===
Oliver wrote and presented the current [[BBC America]] campaign to have viewers use [[closed captioning]] ([[subtitles]]). Shown in brief segments before shows, &quot;The following program contains accents you would have heard a lot more if you hadn't [[Boston Tea Party|thrown our tea into Boston Harbor]],&quot; says one. &quot;Not even British people can follow the British accent 100 percent of the time. Therefore you, like me, might want to use closed-captioning.&quot;  Oliver has begun using some of these jokes in his current stand up routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tvweek.com/blogs/blink/2007/05/translated_from_the_british.php| title=Translated from the British| date=2007-05-21| accessdate=2008-04-19| publisher=TVWeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| title= John Oliver Radio Interview| date=2009-06-03| accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two were married in October 2011, according to fellow comic and ''Bugle'' presenter [[Andy Zaltzman]]'s Twitter feed.

Oliver is a fan of [[Liverpool F.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2007/04/john_oliver_fears_the_end_times.html| title='Daily Show' Correspondent John Oliver Fears We're in the End Times| date=2007-04-10| accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New York Mets]] baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/the_bugle/article6878690.ece| title=The Bugle #93| date=2009-10-16| accessdate=2009-10-17 | location=London | work=The Times | first=Tom | last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver's status as an immigrant placed certain constraints on what he could do in his adopted country, but also provided him with comedic material as he poked fun at the opacity and occasional absurdity of the process of attaining US citizenship. Oliver was one of the many writers on the picket lines during the [[2007â2008 Writers Guild of America strike|Writer's Guild strike]] which brought ''The Daily Show'' to a halt,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but he appeared on the show upon its resuming production on 7 January 2008. During a sketch, he pointed out that he is in the U.S. on a [[Visa (document)|visa]] which requires him not to strike while the show is in production and violation of the terms of the visa would be grounds for deportation. When asked about his immigration status in early 2009, Oliver said, &quot;It's an ongoing, and slightly unsettling, battle to be honest. I tried engraving 'Give me your tired, your poor, and your aspiring comic performers' into the base of the Statue of Liberty, but apparently that's not legally binding.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Comic Crumpet&quot;/&gt; In an episode of [[The Bugle]] released 31 October 2009, Oliver announced that he &quot;finally got approved for [his] [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]],&quot; noting that now he can &quot;get arrested filming bits for ''[[The Daily Show]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugle 94&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/the_bugle/article6895545.ece|title=The Bugle #94: Does the EU really want El Presidente Blair?|date=31 October 2009|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2009-10-31 | location=London | first=Tom | last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Oliver's parents are from [[Liverpool, England]].
