Hannah Ashworth goes to a music festival with her brothers [[Rhys Ashworth|Rhys]] ([[Andrew Moss]]) and [[Josh Ashworth]] ([[Sonny Flood]]) where she meets Jamie. When Hannah falls off a podium, Jamie catches her and they begin to develop feelings for each other. Jamie and his friend Imogen (Holly Gilbert) invite Hannah to stay at their house for the night. Jamie and Hannah spend the night on the beach together. Jamie begs an angry Hannah to stay after Imogen tells her that Jamie is a drug dealer. Jamie and Hannah each take an ecstasy pill and they sleep together. Jamie asks Hannah to stay with him, to which she agrees. When Hannah discovers that Imogen is prostituting herself, Imogen's pimp Kev (James Cartwright) hits her. Jamie is woken by the shouting and rushes downstairs, where he distracts Kev as Hannah escapes. Hannah hides in the ice cream van and lets Jamie in, where they drive away. Jamie finds Kev's drugs in the ice cream van and thinks he can sell them, but Hannah tells him Kev will want revenge. They then plan to leave together. Hannah throws away the drugs that Jamie found and tells him that he does not need to deal drugs anymore. Jamie then frantically tries to retrieve them and Hannah realises that he has chosen drugs over her. Hannah decides to leave.

In February 2010, Hannah arrives at [[The Dog in the Pond]] public house and finds Jamie talking to her mother [[Suzanne Ashworth|Suzanne]] ([[Suzanne Hall]]). Jamie tells Hannah that he is no longer dealing drugs, however Hannah asks him to leave. Hannah tells Jamie to leave before Rhys finds him. Rhys tells Jamie to stay away from Hannah. Jamie then calls Hannah and tells her that he loves her. Hannah's friend [[Nancy Hayton]] ([[Jessica Fox]]) meets Jamie and takes a dislike to him after becoming concerned for Hannah's safety. Hannah later meets up with Jamie who is in pain, and realises that Rhys beat him up. Jamie asks Hannah to leave with him and kisses her. Hannah responds, but insists that their relationship has to be on her terms. Hannah's husband [[Darren Osborne]] ([[Ashley Taylor Dawson]]) asks Jamie for drugs after he and Rhys plan to set Jamie up. Jamie tells Darren that he does not deal drugs. Suzanne attempts to find out how serious Jamie and Hannah's relationsip is and shows him Hannah's video diary whilst she was suffering from anorexia nervosa. Jamie is shocked but tells Suzanne that he will take care of Hannah. As Jamie goes to meet Hannah, he is stopped and beaten. He is thrown into the boot of a car and dumped in the woods by Rhys and Darren, where Rhys tells him to stay away from Hannah. Jamie returns to The Dog in the Pond and when Hannah asked him what happened, he points at Rhys and Darren. 

Jamie is worried when he gets a text from Blue (Kyle Rees) and begins to panic. Jamie then persuades Hannah to leave the following day. At Hannah's leaving party, Jamie receives a call from Blue and quickly begins to pack his bag. Whilst packing, Jamie discovers that the money from his bag is missing. When Blue calls again for the missing money, Jamie begins to panic and sends Hannah out whilst he looks for it. Jamie finds out that Rhys has the money and Rhys gives him an ultimatum, to leave with the money alone, or leave without it with Hannah. When Hannah's family say goodbye to her, Jamie arrives late. Jamie and Hannah stay in a hotel after there flight is delayed and Hannah finds their room trashed. Jamie returns to find Blue with Hannah and admits that he stole the money and explains that he no longer has it. Jamie calls Rhys to prove that he does not have the money, but Rhys denies any involvement. Jamie and Blue fight and as Jamie struggles to defend himself, he reaches for a letter opener and stabs Blue. Hannah begs Jamie to call an ambulance, but he refuses and asks her to leave Blue and go on the run with him. Hannah says she is not leaving until an ambulance is called and Jamie agrees. Jamie then tries to leave and when Hannah refuses, he grabs their bags and drags Hannah to the door. Jamie finds Darren at the door and attempts to leave, but Darren refuses to move. Hannah tells Darren she loves Jamie and they rush down the corridor, but the police confront them. Jamie becomes angry and thinks that Darren called them, but Hannah tells him that she called them. Jamie then pulls the letter opener from his pocket and points it in Hannah's back. He begins to usher her out of the building and warns the police that if they try to stop him, he will kill Hannah. Darren then jumps to save Hannah, but Jamie stabs him. Jamie is arrested by the police.

Fern discovers [[Jasmine Costello]] is transgender, and threatens to reveal the secret to her family after Jasmine rejects a kiss from Fern.

Jasmine's brother [[Seth Costello]] asks Fern to go with him as his date to the school disco, to annoy Jasmine. Later, at the school disco, Fern provokes Jasmine further by threatening to reveal her secret, yet again, on the sound system, as she had a copy of the recording on CD. Fern uses this to blackmail Jasmine to expose her secret, but along with Bart, Jasmine reports her to the police, forcing her to tell the truth about Jason. Despite Jasmine's attempt to tell the whole family about it, Seth meets Fern where she tells him all about Jasmine being Jason. Fern appears a few weeks later, when she apologises and tells Bart and Jason that she will plead guilty at her trial but only if they say that Bart's stabbing was an accident. After a heart-to-heart with Fern, Jason tells her she should come out as lesbian.
