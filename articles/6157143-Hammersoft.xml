The '''Michigan State Spartans football''' program represents [[Michigan State University]] in [[college football]] as members of the [[Big Ten Conference]] at the [[Division I (NCAA)|NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] level.  Michigan State has won or shared a total of six national championships (1951, 1952, 1955, 1957, 1965, and 1966), two Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association championships (1903 and 1905), and seven Big Ten championships (1953, 1965, 1966, 1978, 1987, 1990, and 2010).  Currently 24 former Spartans are playing in the [[NFL]].&lt;ref name=profootballrefence110808&gt;[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/colleges/ Pro Football Reference], ''Pro Football Reference'', September 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the team competes in [[Spartan Stadium, East Lansing|Spartan Stadium]], a 75,005 person football stadium in the center of campus, though frequently the stadium holds more than 80,000 spectators.  Michigan State hired [[Mark Dantonio]] on November 27, 2006 as head coach.  MSU's traditional archrival is the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan]], against whom they compete for the [[Paul Bunyan Trophy]]. Michigan State is one of three Big Ten teams to have an annual non-conference football game against the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|University of Notre Dame]]. 

==History==
{{See also|List of Michigan State Spartans football seasons}}
[[File:UMvsMAC.jpg|thumb|left|1913 Michigan Agricultural College (MSU) vs Michigan]]Starting as a club sport in 1885, football gained varsity status in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Grinczel, Steve. | title=They Are Spartans | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2003 | isbn=0-7385-3214-2}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Early teams at the then Michigan Agricultural College (MAC) competed in the [[Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (MIAA), which was chartered in 1888 and is the oldest existing collegiate leagues in the United States.  Previously, in 1884, [[Albion College]] and  Michigan Agricultural had played in the first intercollegiate football game held within the state of Michigan.  The MIAA's other charter members included Albion, Olivet and Hillsdale Colleges. The Association's first season of competitive football was in 1894 which by then also included [[Eastern Michigan Eagles football|Eastern Michigan University]] (then Michigan Normal School) and [[Alma College]]; [[Kalamazoo College]] was added in 1896.  In those early years the MAC Aggies could only accomplish one outright league football championship (1905) and share another with Albion (1903). The first decade of the 20th Century generally saw the MIAA and MAC being dominated by either Albion or Olivet Colleges. MSU left the league and became an Independent in 1907.  
During the 1950s when Detroit was known as the world's leading automobile manufacturer, Michigan State was often referred to as the nation's &quot;football factory.&quot;  It was then that the Spartans churned out such impressive models as [[Lynn Chandnois]], [[Dorne Dibble]], [[Don McAulliffe]], [[Tom Yewcic]], [[Sonny Grandelius]], [[Bob Carey (American football)|Bob Carey]], [[Don Coleman]], [[Earl Morrall]] and [[Dean Look]].  In 1951, the Spartans finished undefeated and untied to claim a share of the national championship with Tennessee.  A second consecutive undefeated season led to a consensus national title in 1952.  The team was admitted into the Big Ten as a regular member in 1949.  They promptly went on to capture the league championship (losing only one game during the season) and beating [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] in their first [[1954 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl game]]. After the 1953 season [[Biggie Munn]], the Spartan coach, turned the team over to his protÃ©gÃ© [[Duffy Daugherty]]. The team won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] in 1954, 1956, and 1988.

From the creation of Division I-AA (now called [[Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]]) in 1978 through the 2008 season, Michigan State never played a I-AA/FCS opponent, holding out longer in doing so than all but four other [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] schools.&lt;ref name=LAT092007&gt;Chris Dufrense, [http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-dufresne20sep20,1,3065434,full.column UCLA victory is crucial for Dorrell], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spartans ended their streak by opening the 2009 season against FCS member [[Montana State University - Bozeman|Montana State]].

==Coaching history==

===Mark Dantonio===
{{Main|Mark Dantonio}}
On November 27, 2006, [[Mark Dantonio]] was hired from the [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|University of Cincinnati]] to become Michigan State's new men's football head coach.  He has compiled a 41â21 (25â13) record while at Michigan State.  In 2010, Dantonio led Michigan State to a share of the Big Ten Championship with a 7-1 record. It was Michigan State's first Big Ten Championship in over 20 years.  He has 4-1 record against rival Michigan winning the [[Paul Bunyan Trophy]] in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. This streak of 4 wins in a row ties the Spartans best in the rivalry.  Dantonio's record also includes a 3-2 mark for the [[Megaphone Trophy]] which goes to the winner of the Michigan State vs. Notre Dame rivalry football game.  Dantonio served as an assistant coach at Michigan State from 1995-2000, and was [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]]'s defensive coordinator during their [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2002 national championship season]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2676952 ESPN - Michigan St. hires Dantonio, Iowa State still looking - College Football&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was also an assistant at [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]] and [[Youngstown State Penguins|Youngstown State University]].  He is known as a defensive-minded coach and has been on the coaching staffs of [[Glen Mason]], [[Jim Tressel]] and [[Nick Saban]].

===Nick Saban===
{{Main|Nick Saban}}
When Saban arrived in [[East Lansing, Michigan]] prior to the 1995 season, MSU had not had a winning season since 1990, and the team was sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations committed under his predecessor and former mentor, [[George Perles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncaa.org/databases/register/register_961007/michigan.html Infractions Case: Michigan State University], ''NCAA Register'', October 7, 1996. Accessed May 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1995â1997''' â Beginning in 1995, Saban moderately improved MSU's fortunes, taking the Spartans to minor bowl games (all of which they lost by double-digit margins) in each of his first three seasons. From 1995 to 1997, Michigan State finished 6-5-1, 6-6, and 7-5. In comparison, MSU had finished 5â6, 6â6 and 5â6 (prior to NCAA forfeits) in 1992â1994.

* '''1998''' â On November 7, 1998, the Spartans upset the #1 ranked [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] 28â24 at [[Ohio Stadium]]. However, even after the upset and an early-season rout of then-highly-ranked Notre Dame the Spartans finished 6â6, including three last-minute losses featuring turnovers, defensive lapses, and special-teams misplays, and failed to earn a bowl invitation.

* '''1999''' â Saban led the Spartans to a 9â2 season that included wins over [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Notre Dame]], [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]], and [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]]. Conversely, the two losses were routs at the hands of [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] and [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]]. Following the final regular-season game against Penn State, Saban abruptly resigned to accept the head coaching position with [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]. Saban's assistant head coach and successor, [[Bobby Williams]], then coached MSU to a [[Florida Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] victory over [[Florida Gators football|Florida]], giving the Spartans an overall record of 10â2 for the 1999 season. It would be the best season in terms of wins for the Spartans since 1965, and it would see the Spartans reach their highest ranking since the 1966 team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/bigten/michigan_state/in_the_polls.php|title=Michigan State In the Polls|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse|accessdate=2008-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future former NFL Head Coach [[Josh McDaniels]] served as a Graduate Assistant on Saban's 1999 coaching staff.

===George Perles===
{{Main|George Perles}}

After returning from US Army active duty, Perles returned to Michigan where he enrolled at Michigan State University and played football under legendary coach Duffy Daugherty. Perles played the 1958 season before his playing career was cut short by a knee injury. Perles then started his football coaching career as a graduate assistant at Michigan State before moving on to the high school ranks in Chicago and Detroit, where his St. Ambrose High School team won their first Detroit City League Championship in 1961. Perles returned to Michigan State as defensive line coach under his mentor, Daugherty.

In 1972, Chuck Noll, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, offered Perles the position of defensive line coach. In Perlesâ first season, the Steelers made the NFL playoffs for the second time in franchise history, the first since 1947, losing to the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Championship Game.  In 1974, the Steelers won the first of six consecutive AFC Central division championships and also their first Super Bowl. Perles became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers in 1978 and then assistant head coach under Noll in 1979. During Perles' ten years with Pittsburgh (1972â1981), the Steelers won a then-unprecedented four Super Bowls and became known as the team of the decade for the 1970s, largely on the back of their &quot;Stunt 4-3&quot; defense designed by Perles.

Perles returned to Michigan State University on December 3, 1982. In 12 years, he led the Spartans to two Big Ten Conference titles, seven bowl games and a victory in the 1988 Rose Bowl. The 1987 season marked the Spartans' last outright Big Ten title to date.  During the 1987 season Perles and Michigan State beat Southern Cal twice in the same season, once in the regular season and one in the Rose Bowl.

During 1994â1995, an extensive external investigation conducted by the law firm of Bond, Schoeneck &amp; King, PLLC. uncovered various infractions including grade tampering by an athletic department administrator. MSU president M. Peter McPherson fired Perles before the end of the 1994 season, and ordered the Spartans to forfeit their five wins for that season.  Perles was found &quot;not culpable&quot; by the NCAA.

===Duffy Daugherty===
{{Main|Duffy Daugherty}}

Duffy Daugherty (September 8, 1915 â September 25, 1987) replaced  [[Clarence Munn]] known as &quot;Biggie&quot; Munn, in December 1953, following Munn's retirement to become Michigan State's athletic director.  Daugherty would serve as the head coach at [[Michigan State University]] from 1954 to 1972, where he compiled a career record of 109â69â5. Duffy's 1965 and 1966 teams won national championships. Duffy's tenure of 19 seasons at the helm of the Michigan State Spartans football team is the longest of any head coach in the program's history. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1984.

* '''1954â1964''' After compiling a disappointing 3â6 record in Daugherty's first season in 1954, the Spartans improved and finished second in the Big Ten behind Ohio State in 1955 with an 8â1 record in the regular season. Michigan State received the conference's invitation to the 1956 Rose Bowl instead of the Buckeyes due to the conference's prohibition against consecutive trips to the Rose Bowl. In Pasadena, the Spartans defeated UCLA, 17â14, for their second bowl win in school history.  From 1956 to 1964, Daugherty's Michigan State teams were usually good, three times placing second in Big Ten, but never captured the conference crown.  The Spartans did, however, beat [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] eight straight times between 1955 and 1963, a feat matched only by [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] (1887&amp;ndash;1908) and [[USC Trojans football|USC]] (2002&amp;ndash;2009).  On November 5, 1964, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] found Daugherty's program at Michigan State guilty of NCAA infractions prior to and during the 1957, 1958, and 1959 seasons.  Daughtery's football program was put on probation for three years following the 1964 decision.

* '''1965â1966''' The 1965 and 1966 seasons were the high points in Daugherty's coaching tenure, if not in the history of Michigan State football.  The [[1965 Michigan State Spartans football team|1965 team]] finished the regular season 10&amp;ndash;0 and ranked first in the country, but was upset by UCLA in the [[1966 Rose Bowl]], 14&amp;ndash;12.  Nevertheless, Michigan State was named national champions by the [[United Press International|UPI]] and the National Football Foundation.  The [[1966 Michigan State Spartans football team|1966 team]] began the season 9&amp;ndash;0 and headed into their final game ranked #2 against #1 [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] at [[Spartan Stadium (East Lansing)|Spartan Stadium]] on November 19.  The [[1966 Notre Dame vs. Michigan State football game|#1 vs. #2 showdown]], dubbed the &quot;[[Game of the Century (college football)|The Game of the Century]]&quot; by national media, ended in a 10&amp;ndash;10 tie.  The Spartans did not play in a bowl game following the 1966 season due to Big Ten rules in place at the time that prohibited its teams from playing in the Rose Bowl in consecutive years and barred participation in any other bowl.  Notre Dame and Michigan State received a share of the 1966 national championship.

* '''1967â1972'''Beginning with the 1967 season, there was a decline in the Spartans football program under Duffy.  Daugherty's teams in the late 60s and early 70s consistently hovered around the .500 mark, with only his 1971 squad finishing with a winning record (6&amp;ndash;5).  Under pressure from MSU's administration, Daugherty retired after the 1972 season and was succeeded as head coach by [[Denny Stolz]].

During Daugherty's time in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]], he recruited and coached some of the best players in Michigan State's history, including [[Herb Adderley]], [[Brad Van Pelt]], [[Bubba Smith]], [[George D. Webster|George Webster]], and [[Joe DeLamielleure]].  He was one of the first college football coaches to field a racially integrated team.

===&quot;Biggie&quot; Munn===
{{Main|Clarence Munn}}

'''Clarence Lester &quot;Biggie&quot; Munn''' (September 11, 1908 &amp;ndash; March 18, 1975) was head coach of Michigan State from (1947&amp;ndash;1953).  His [[1951 Michigan State Spartans football team|1951 squad]] and [[1952 Michigan State Spartans football team|1952 squad]] won [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championships]].  Munn retired from coaching in 1953 to assume duties as Michigan State's [[athletic director]], a position he held until 1971.  Each year, the [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State Spartans football team]] hands out the &quot;Biggie Munn Award&quot; to the team's most motivational player.  MSU's [[Munn Ice Arena]], built in 1974, is named in his honor.  Munn was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] as a coach in 1959, and, in 1961, he became Michigan State's first inductee into the [[Michigan Sports Hall of Fame]].  He authored the coaching textbook ''Michigan State Multiple Offense'' in 1953.

* '''1947â1950'''  In 1947, Munn and the Michigan State administration, led by university president [[John A. Hannah]], approached [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] president [[John J. Cavanaugh|Father Cavanaugh]] to have his [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Fighting Irish]] play the Spartans for the first time since 1921.  MSU initially offered to let Notre Dame take 80 percent of the gate, but Cavanaugh insisted they split the receipts down the middle.  Munn was the only coach to beat Notre Dame head coach [[Frank Leahy]] three years in a row (1950&amp;ndash;1952).  Starting with a 33-14 win over William &amp; Mary in East Lansing on October 14th, 1950 Biggie Munn start his historic 28 game winning streak.

* '''1951'''  The [[1951 Michigan State Spartans football team]] went undefeated and were elected the National Champions by the [[Helms Athletic Foundation]]; however, the rest of the polls voted for the Tennessee Volunteers, who lost in the Sugar Bowl to the Maryland Terrapins, but post season games did not count back then.  Michigan State 

* '''1952'''  [[1952 Michigan State Spartans football team|1952 squad]] continued Munn's undefeated streak going 9-0.  Michigan State won a [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championship]] for the second year in a row and for the first time in school history were voted #1 in both the AP and Coaches' polls.  Munn was named the [[AFCA Coach of the Year]], coaching MSU to 9&amp;ndash;0 record and a 

* '''1953''' In 1953, Michigan State's first year of conference play in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], the Spartans shared the conference title with [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] and went to the [[1954 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]], where they beat [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]], 28&amp;ndash;20.  October 24th, 1953 Purdue upset the Spartans 6-0 ending Munn's 28 game winning streak.  The Spartans won the first ever [[Paul Bunyan Trophy]] after beating rival Michigan 14-6 in East Lansing.

Shortly after the Rose Bowl victory, MSU's [[athletic director]], [[Ralph H. Young]] retired.  Munn stepped down from coaching to assume duties as athletic director and remained in that position until 1971.  Munn named his assistant, [[Duffy Daugherty]], as his to successor to helm the football team.  During his tenure as Michigan State's head football coach, Munn tutored 17 [[College Football All-America Team|All-Americans]]. His teams have retained the school's top four season marks for [[Rush (American football)|rushing]]-yards-per-game: 1948 (304.5 yards/game), 1951 (293.9 yards), 1952 (272.4), and 1950 (269.3).  Munn was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1959.

==Football facilities==
===Spartan Stadium===
{{Main|Spartan Stadium (East Lansing)}}
[[Image:MSU Spartan Stadium Facade.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spartan Stadium, East Lansing|Spartan Stadium]] hosts varsity [[American football|football]] games and other events.]]
Spartan Stadium will enter its 88th season as home to Michigan State football in 2011.  Until the 1920s, Michigan State's football team played on Old College Field just northwest of the current stadium. In the early 1920s school officials decided to construct a new stadium to replace Old College Field. College Field, the future '''Spartan Stadium''' was ready in the fall of 1923 with a capacity of 14,000. Over the years the stadium grew.  In 1935 the [[seating capacity]] was increased to 26,000 and the facility was dedicated as Macklin Field. By 1957, upper decks were added to the east and west ends, boosting the capacity to 76,000. That same season Michigan State dropped the name Macklin Stadium in favor of Spartan Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegegridirons.com/bigten/SpartanStadium.htm College Gridirons, Spartan Stadium].  Accessed 2006-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Michigan State finished a new $64 million expansion project to Spartan Stadium. It featured the addition of nearly 3,000 club seats in the &quot;Spartan Club,&quot; 24 suites and a 193-seat press box, bringing the current stadium capacity to 75,005. The original [[World War II]]-era [[terracotta]] cast of the &quot;[[Sparty#Statues|The Spartan]]&quot; statue was moved indoors to the atrium of the new structure to protect it from the elements and occasional vandalism, and a new [[bronze]] cast was made for outdoors. The {{convert|200,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} addition also houses the MSU Alumni Association, University Development and other units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msuspartans.com/facilities/spartan-stadium.html |title=Michigan State Official Athletic Site - Facilities |publisher=Msuspartans.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spartan Stadium's capacity is 75,005, making it the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten's]] sixth largest stadium and 23rd largest college football stadium in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference#Conference_facilities |title=Big Ten Conference - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_football_stadiums_by_capacity |title=List of American football stadiums by capacity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia |publisher=En.wikipedia.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 Spartan Stadium had the 19th highest attendance in NCAA Division I FBS.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/pdfs/2011/2010+national+college+football+attendance |title=2010 National College Football Attendance |publisher=NCAA.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spartan Stadium is so loud that [[Stanley Kubrick]]âs ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) uses a recording of the crowd noise during the 1959 Michigan State-Notre Dame game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://special.news.msu.edu/back_to_school/facts.html |title=Newsroom Special Reports |publisher=Special.news.msu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the 2007 football season the student section had around 13,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msuspartans.com/genrel/071508aaf.html#_ |title=Spartan Football Student Section Expands - MICHIGAN STATE OFFICIAL ATHLETIC SITE |publisher=Msuspartans.com |date=2008-07-15 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the basketball student section the Izzone, the Michigan State Student Alumni Foundation used to oversee a subgroup in the football student section named &quot;Corner Blitz.&quot; When head coach [[Mark Dantonio]] took over the football program in 2006 &quot;Corner Blitz&quot; was united with the normal student section.  Like Corner Blitz the entire student section now receives a special t-shirt which is voted on annually. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.msu.edu/story/9471/ |title=Fans can vote for 2011 football student section T-shirt &amp;#124; MSU News &amp;#124; Michigan State University |publisher=News.msu.edu |date=2011-06-09 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duffy Daugherty Building / Skandalaris Center===
In 2007 Michigan State expanded it's Duffy Daugherty Football Building with a $15 million expansion and renovation project.  The face-lift started with construction of the {{convert|25,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Skandalaris Football Center that features new team, staff and position meeting rooms, coaches' offices, MSU football Players Lounge and The Demmer Family Hall of History. MSU alumni Robert and Julie Skandalaris of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., donated $5 million as the lead gift for the $15 million project.  In 2008, weight room was increased in size from 9,000 to {{convert|16,500|sqft|m2}} at a cost of $2 million.  The complex includes a {{convert|86,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} indoor practice facility with a full in-door football field, two outdoor practice football fields and a training room with a rehab and hydrotherapy section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msuspartans.com/facilities/daugherty-skandalaris.html#_ |title=Michigan State Official Athletic Site - Facilities |publisher=Msuspartans.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
