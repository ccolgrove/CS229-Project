The '''Irish general election of 1957''' was held on 5 March 1957, just over three weeks after the [[Dissolution of parliament|dissolution]] of the DÃ¡il on 4 February. The newly elected [[members of the 16th DÃ¡il]] assembled at [[Leinster House]] on 20 March when the new [[Taoiseach]] and [[Government of Ireland|government]] were appointed.

The general election took place in [[Parliamentary constituencies in the Republic of Ireland|40 parliamentary constituencies]] throughout [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for 147 seats in the lower house of parliament, [[DÃ¡il Ãireann]].

==Campaign==
The general election of 1957 was precipitated by the crisis in the trade balance and the government's reaction to it. As a result of this [[Fianna FÃ¡il]] tabled a [[motion of no confidence]] in the inter-party government of [[Fine Gael]], [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] and [[Clann na Talmhan]].  Rather than face defeat in the vote the [[Taoiseach]] [[John A. Costello]], decided to dissolve the DÃ¡il and let the people decide. The campaign was fought largely over economic issues and the situation in the North. In the north the IRA launched [[Border Campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Operation Harvest]] which drew much popular support in the south. [[Sinn FÃ©in]]  had been re-built and re-organized as a party by [[Paddy McLogan]] and was fielding abstentionist candidates.

Fianna FÃ¡il had produced a major policy document in January, criticising many of its own policies in regard to the economy. While they did not know an election was imminent this became the backbone of their manifesto. The importance of free trade was played up by Fianna FÃ¡il in a clear rejection of the protectionist policies they had advocated in the past. The architect of many of these new policies was the spokesperson for [[Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ireland)|Industry and Commerce]] and the heir-apparent of the party, [[SeÃ¡n Lemass]]. At 75 years of age [[Ãamon de Valera]] was fighting his last general election as leader of the party.  In spite of his age he carried out a vigorous campaign, often being accompanied by brass bands and torch-lit processions.  The Fianna FÃ¡il message was simple: coalition governments were unstable.

The other parties, most of them having enjoyed a stint in government over the previous three years, fought the election on their record in office, Fine Gael in particular. Clann na Talmhan failed to broaden their appeal and remained the voice of the farmers. [[Clann na Poblachta]] under [[Sean MacBride]] had agreed not to stand in constituencies where [[Sinn FÃ©in]] were fielding candidates and never made the breakthrough it had hoped for and lost two of its three seats. Sinn FÃ©in, fighting one of its first post-war elections polled well on an [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] ticket, winning 4 seats
