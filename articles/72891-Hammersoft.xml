The '''Golden State Warriors''' are an American professional basketball team based in [[Oakland, California]]. They are part of the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] of the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). The team was first established in 1946, as the [[Philadelphia Warriors]], in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, where the franchise won the championship in the inaugural season of the [[Basketball Association of America]] (BAA), the league that would eventually become the National Basketball Association. In 1962, the franchise was relocated to San Francisco, California and became known as the San Francisco Warriors until 1971, when its name was changed to the current Golden State Warriors. The team has played all of its home games in the [[Oracle Arena]] since 1966, with the exception of a one-year hiatus where they played in [[San Jose, California]] when the Oracle Arena was being remodeled. 

Along with their inaugural championship win in the [[1946-47 BAA season|1946â47 season]], the Warriors have won two others in the team's history, including another in Philadelphia after the [[1955â56 NBA season|1955â56 season]], and one as Golden State after the [[1974â75 NBA season|1974â75 season]], tying them for 5th in the NBA in number of championships.

===1946â1962: Two championships in Philadelphia===
[[Image:PhiladelphiaWarriors.png|left|thumb|100px|Philadelphia Warriors logo 1946â1962]]
The Warriors were founded in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania in 1946 as the [[Philadelphia Warriors]], a charter member of the [[National Basketball Association#History|Basketball Association of America]].  They were owned by Peter Tyrrell, who also owned the [[Philadelphia Rockets]] of the [[American Hockey League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encyc29&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia, |publisher=Villard Books |year=1994 |page=29 |isbn=0-679-43293-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tyrell hired [[Edward Gottlieb|Eddie Gottlieb]], a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyc33&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia, |publisher=Villard Books |year=1994 |page=33 |isbn=0-679-43293-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named the team after an early professional team in the city.

Led by early scoring sensation [[Joe Fulks]], they won the championship in the league's inaugural [[1946â47 BAA season|1946â47 season]] by defeating the [[Chicago Stags]], four games to one. (The BAA became the [[National Basketball Association]] in 1949.) Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.

The Warrior's won their other championship as a Philadelphia team in the [[1955â56 NBA season|1955â56 season]], defeating the [[Detroit Pistons|Fort Wayne Pistons]] four games to one. The stars of this era in the team's history were future Hall of Famers [[Paul Arizin]], [[Michael Bryson]] and [[Neil Johnston]]. In 1959, the team signed draft pick [[Wilt Chamberlain]]. Known as &quot;Wilt the Stilt&quot;, Wilt Chamberlain, who was a six-time scoring champion with the Warriors, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior &quot;home&quot; game played on a neutral court in [[Hershey, Pennsylvania]], Chamberlain [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game|scored 100 points]] against the [[New York Knicks]], a single-game record that the NBA ranks among its finest moments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/top-moments-60s/index.html  NBA's top moments: the 60s]. Retrieved November 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962â1971: San Francisco Warriors===
In 1962, [[Franklin Mieuli]] purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the [[Cow Palace]] in [[Daly City, California|Daly City]] (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco border) from 1962â64 and the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium|San Francisco Civic Auditorium]] from 1964â66, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. The Warriors won the [[1963â64 NBA season|1963â64]] Western Division crown, losing the NBA championship series to the Boston Celtics, four games to one.

In the 1964â65 season, the Warriors traded Wilt Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000, as they only won 17 games that season. In 1965, the Warriors drafted [[Rick Barry]] in the first round. Barry was named NBA Rookie of the Year in his first season, then led the Warriors to the NBA finals in the [[1966â67 NBA season|1966â67 season]], where the team lost (four games to two) to the team that replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the [[Philadelphia 76ers|76ers]]. Angered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive awards he felt he was due, Barry sat out the [[1967â68 NBA season|1967â68 season]], joining the [[Oakland Oaks (ABA)|Oakland Oaks]] of the rival [[American Basketball Association]] the following year. After four seasons in the ABA, Barry rejoined the Warriors in 1972. With the opening of the [[Oracle Arena|Oakland Coliseum Arena]] in 1966, the Warriors began scheduling increasing numbers of home games at that venue. The [[1970â71 NBA season|1970â71 season]] would be the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors.

===1971â1977: Golden State Warriors and championship===
[[Image:1971-76 GS Warriors Logo.pngâ|170px|right|thumb|Warriors logo 1971â1987]]

The Warriors changed their name to the Golden State Warriors for the [[1971â72 NBA season|1971â72 season]], playing almost all home games in Oakland. Six &quot;home&quot; games were played in San Diego during that season but more significantly, none were played in San Francisco or Daly City. After changing their name from the San Francisco Warriors, the Warriors became one of only two teams in the [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|Big Four]] sports that do not include the name of their state or their city in their name (although &quot;Golden State&quot; is a well-known California [[List of U.S. state nicknames|nickname]]), the other being the [[New England Patriots]] of the [[National Football League]].

The Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 (except 1974), and won their only championship on the West Coast in [[1974â75 NBA season|1974â75]]. In what many{{who|date=November 2011}} consider the biggest upset in the history of the NBA, the Warriors defeated the heavily favored [[Washington Wizards|Washington Bullets]] in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior [[Al Attles]], and led on the court by [[Rick Barry]], [[Jamaal Wilkes]] and [[Phil Smith]]. So little was felt of the team's chances in the playoffs, even by their home fans, that the Coliseum Arena scheduled other events during the dates of the NBA playoffs. As a result, the Warriors did not play their championship series playoff games in Oakland; rather, they played at the Cow Palace in Daly City.

===1978â1987: A period of struggles===
Because of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond, to bad trades and retirements, the Warriors would struggle to put a competitive team on the court from 1978â1987 following their time as one of the NBA's dominant teams during the 1960s and most of the 1970s. They would, however, through the draft acquire such standout players such as high-scoring forward [[Purvis Short]] (1978), former Georgetown Hoyas point guard [[Eric &quot;Sleepy&quot; Floyd]] (1982) (who would later become an All-Star before being traded to the Houston Rockets), and former Purdue University standout center [[Joe Barry Carroll]], (1980) whose once promising career would be short-circuited because of injury, as well as center [[Robert Parish]] (1976), whom they would trade to the Boston Celtics in 1980.

The departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Al Attles would move up into the front office to become the team's General Manager in 1980, and the team would go through several coaching changes. With Attles installed as GM, however, they would finally manage to climb back to respectability by hiring former [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] head coach [[George Karl]] as head coach in 1986. They would also find a diamond in the rough, of sorts, that would change the direction of the franchise, drafting St. John's University standout sharpshooting small forward [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]] in the 1985 NBA Draft.

===1987â1997: Resurgence and collapse===
After a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence with coach Karl, culminating in a famous 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson's Lakers, which is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series. [[Image:Golden State Warriors 1987-1995 720x540.PNGâ|240px|right|thumb|Warriors logo 1987â1997]] In the game, the Warrior's NBA All-Star point guard [[Sleepy Floyd]] had an amazing performance in the second half, which is still the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39).  Floyd scored 6 consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter, finishing the game with 51 points, and leading the Warriors to victory.  

The &quot;Sleepy Floyd Game&quot; was a catalyst for increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area, which was furthered by new coach [[Don Nelson]] who engineered another successful string of wins in the late 1980s to early 1990s with the high scoring trio of point guard [[Tim Hardaway]], guard [[Mitch Richmond]], and forward [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]] (collectively known as &quot;Run-T.M.C.&quot; after the rap group [[Run-D.M.C.]]). However, coach [[Don Nelson]], wishing to get frontcourt players to complement [[Nellie Ball|his run-and-gun system]], made a trade that broke up the Run-T.M.C. core by sending Richmond to the [[Sacramento Kings]] for [[Billy Owens]]. Nelson was brought to the team by [[Jim Fitzgerald]], who owned the team between [[1986â87 NBA season|1986]] and [[1994â95 NBA season|1995]]. In [[1993â94 NBA season|1993â94]], with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year [[Chris Webber]] playing alongside [[Latrell Sprewell]], the Warriors made the playoffs.

The season after that, however, saw a rift form between Webber, Sprewell and Nelson. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. [[1994â95 NBA season|1994â95]] was the first season under former team owner [[Chris Cohan]]. While the Oakland Coliseum underwent a complete renovation, the [[1996â97 NBA season|1996â97]] Golden State Warriors played their home games in the [[HP Pavilion at San Jose|San Jose Arena]] in [[San Jose, California]], struggling to a 30â52 finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/history/00401109.html#25 |title=WARRIORS: Golden State Warriors History |publisher=Nba.com |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the 1997â98 season for choking head coach [[P. J. Carlesimo]] during a team practice in December 1997. He would not play until he was dealt in January 1999 to the [[New York Knicks]] for [[John Starks (basketball)|John Starks]], [[Chris Mills]] and [[Terry Cummings]].

===1997â2004: Garry St. Jean era===
[[Image:Golden State Warriors.svg|thumb|200px|Warriors Logo 1997â2010]]
[[Garry St. Jean]] became the new Warriors [[General manager|GM]] in July 1997; he and [[Dave Twardzik]] received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles following the start of Chris Cohan's tenure, including Cohan himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mark |last=Fainaru-Wada |title=The man who owns the Warriors / Cohan's rocky reign / An era marked by lost games, lost fans and endless litigation |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/02/10/SP74259.DTL |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 10, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Jean brought in several players, such as Terry Cummings, John Starks, and [[Mookie Blaylock]], who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as [[Todd Fuller]] (while [[Kobe Bryant]] was still available) and [[Steve Logan]] (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft the future 2-time NBA [[slam dunk]] champion [[Jason Richardson]] (from [[Michigan State University|Michigan State]]), who would become a key player on the team until the end of the 2006â07 season.

For a few years, with rising stars [[Jason Richardson]], [[Antawn Jamison]] and guard [[Gilbert Arenas]] leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise. In the end the young Warriors just did not have enough in the ultra-competitive Western Conference. After the [[2002â03 NBA season|2002â03 season]], Garry St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like [[Danny Fortson]], [[Adonal Foyle]] and [[Erick Dampier]] were painfully felt by Warriors fans when the team was unable to re-sign up-and-coming star Gilbert Arenas, despite Arenas's desire to stay in the Bay Area.

====2004â2007: Rebuilding ('We Believe' era)====
[[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]] succeeded [[Garry St. Jean]] and assumed the title of Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations in 2004. Mullin hoped to build the team around [[Jason Richardson]], [[Mike Dunleavy, Jr.]], and [[Troy Murphy]]. The team drafted 7-foot center [[Andris BiedriÅÅ¡]] from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, Mullin further added to the team by acquiring guard [[Baron Davis]], bringing the team its first &quot;superstar&quot; since Mullin himself. The Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005â06 season, entering the new year with a winning percentage for the first time since 1994. However, they managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March. Star Baron Davis often found himself at odds with coach [[Mike Montgomery]] and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, [[2005â06 NBA season|2006]], the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention with a 114â109 overtime loss to the [[New Orleans Hornets|Hornets]], extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.

{{See also|2006â07 Golden State Warriors season}}
Entering the 2006â07 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see [[Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks]]). During the 2006 offseason, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of head coach [[Mike Montgomery]]'s contract and hired previous Golden State and former [[Dallas Mavericks]] coach [[Don Nelson]] to take over in his place. During training camp, [[Matt Barnes]] established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, Golden State traded [[Troy Murphy]], [[Mike Dunleavy, Jr.]], [[Ike Diogu]], and [[Keith McLeod]] to the [[Indiana Pacers]] for forward [[Al Harrington]], forward/guard [[Stephen Jackson]], guard [[Å arÅ«nas JasikeviÄius]], and forward [[Josh Powell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/trade_070117.html |title=Pacers make 8-player trade with Warriors @ Pacers official website |publisher=Nba.com |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trade allowed the Warriors to &quot;run and gun&quot; their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 107â106 loss in Washington handing them their 6th straight loss when Gilbert Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining. The loss dropped them to 26â35, a hole inspiring the squad to a point of total determination.

March 4, 2007 marked the turning point in the Warriors season. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42â40) with a 16â5 ending run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/games/20070418/GSWPOR/boxscore.html Warriors@ Trail Blazers Recap] On April 18, 2007, the Warriors clinched their first playoff bid since 1994 with a resounding 120â98 victory in their season finale at [[Portland Trail Blazers|Portland]].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We Believe&quot; became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Marcus, II |last=Thompson |title=Warriors fan is behind 'We Believe' campaign |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/warriors/ci_5764491 |work=[[Contra Costa Times]] |date=April 27, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070717183123/http://www.contracostatimes.com/warriors/ci_5764491 |archivedate=2007-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007 Playoffs====
Led by a healthy [[Baron Davis]], an ever-improving [[Jason Richardson]], and future star [[Monta Ellis]] backed up by [[Andris BiedriÅÅ¡]], the Warriors qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1994. Expectations of a short series were immediately dashed by Golden State's Game 1 victory in Dallas, behind guard Baron Davis and his frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Game 3 and Game 4, with a huge lift from the Warriors' home crowd at the Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118â112 victory to send the 3â2 series back to California. In Game 6, the Warriors used a third-quarter 18â0 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the first No.&amp;nbsp;8 seed to beat a No.&amp;nbsp;1 seed in a seven-game series in a major upset, given that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the season series.

The Warriors went on to play the [[Utah Jazz]] in the second round of the 2006â07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at [[EnergySolutions Arena]] to open the series. The series then shifted to the [[Oracle Arena]], where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing blowout. Baron Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter. The Warriors went on to lose Game 4 at home, in what was their first loss in Oakland in well over a month. The Jazz closed out the Warriors in Game 5 in [[Salt Lake City]].

====2007â2010====
The Golden State Warriors faced early difficulties in remaining a playoff contender.  Shooting guard [[Jason Richardson]] was also traded to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for rookie [[Brandan Wright]]. To make things harder, [[Stephen Jackson]] received a 7-game suspension for his firearm incident. The Warriors opened the season with six straight losses, but Monta Ellis' rise, Baron Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/players/stats?playerId=194 |title=ESPN Baron Davis Player Card |publisher=ESPN  |date=1979-04-13 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an overall improvement in chemistry brought the Warriors back in playoff contention. Nonetheless, the Warriors were officially eliminated from the 2008 Western Conference Playoffs, despite having a 48â34 season (This made them the first team in NBA history not to make the playoffs with at least 48 wins). The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history.

Over the offseason, Baron Davis opted out and signed with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. With the 14th pick of the [[2008 NBA draft]], the Warriors selected and signed [[Anthony Randolph]] out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed [[Corey Maggette]] and [[Ronny Turiaf]], then resigned [[Monta Ellis]] and [[Andris BiedriÅÅ¡]] to long-term contracts.

The Warriors had a disappointing 2008â2009 season, finishing 29â53. [[Monta Ellis]] was injured and suspended for a moped accident, depriving the Warriors of their top player. The Warriors traded forward [[Al Harrington]] to the [[New York Knicks]] for guard [[Jamal Crawford]], but were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as [[Anthony Morrow]] and [[Brandan Wright]]. The Warriors' [[head coach]] Don Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors demonstrated that they could be a tough opponent with a healthy lineup and a strong bench. The Warriors showed that with leadership and improvement in their young players, they are able to defeat powerhouse teams such as their 99â89 win over the [[Boston Celtics]].

During the 2009 offseason, Golden State declined to renew the contract of General Manager [[Chris Mullin (basketball)|Chris Mullin]]. [[Larry Riley]] took over as General Manager and drafted [[Stephen Curry (basketball)|Stephen Curry]] with the 7th lottery pick. In the 2009 offseason, the Warriors traded [[Jamal Crawford]] to the [[Atlanta Hawks]] for [[Acie Law]] and [[Speedy Claxton]].

The Warriors had another injury-prone year, as they were unable consistently to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a discontent [[Stephen Jackson]] and seldom-used [[Acie Law]] were traded to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for [[Raja Bell]] and [[Vladimir Radmanovic]]. Four days later they signed center [[Chris Hunter (basketball)|Chris Hunter]]. During the month of January 2010, they signed multiple 10-day contracts, including one to power forward [[Anthony Tolliver]] from the [[Idaho Stampede]]. Due to a great number of injuries, the Warriors were granted an injury exception and signed [[Reggie Williams (basketball, born 1986)|Reggie Williams]] from the Sioux Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2, 2010, making it their fifth [[D-League]] call up that season, tying an NBA record. The Warriors eventually waived guard [[Raja Bell]] in order to sign Williams for the rest of the year. The Warriors finished the season 26â56, fourth in the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]].

===2010âpresent: The 'Fresh' era ===
On June 24, 2010, the Warriors selected [[Ekpe Udoh]], a forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of 2010 NBA Draft. The Warriors also introduced a modernized version of &quot;The City&quot; logo, with a rendition of the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco â Oakland Bay Bridge|new eastern span]] of the [[San Francisco â Oakland Bay Bridge]] in the logo and returning to the original colors of royal blue and gold. They also debuted new uniforms, which are reminiscent of the 1960s &quot;The City&quot; uniforms. The Warriors made an offseason trade that sent [[Ronny Turiaf]], [[Kelenna Azubuike]] and [[Anthony Randolph]] to the [[New York Knicks]] in return for [[David Lee (basketball)|David Lee]] via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a 6-year, $80&amp;nbsp;million dollar deal, on a framework which was worked on during the day that was contingent on the decision of [[LeBron James]].

Following [[Anthony Morrow]]'s departure after signing an offer sheet to the Nets, the Warriors signed [[Dorell Wright]], formerly with the [[Miami Heat]], to a three-year, $11&amp;nbsp;million deal. On July 15, 2010, franchise owner [[Chris Cohan]] sold the Warriors to [[Peter Guber]] of [[Mandalay Entertainment]] and his partner [[Joe Lacob]] for a record $450&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=5383261 Lacob, Guber have deal to buy Warriors]&quot;.  Associated Press.  July 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Warriors continued their signing spree by adding [[Jeremy Lin]] to their roster, a guard from Harvard to a one-year partially guaranteed contract with a second year team option. He is the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. [[Louis Amundson]] was then added for little under $5&amp;nbsp;million in mid September 2010. [[Keith Smart]] was hired as head coach in September after Don Nelson resigned before the start of training camp. 

In February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2011 second round pick. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement, and he was waived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kawakami |first=Tim |title=Breaking news: Warriors buy out Troy Murphy (and why itâs a wise move) |date=February 27, 2011 |newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]] |url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami/2011/02/27/breaking-news-warriors-buy-out-troy-murphy-and-why-its-a-wise-move/ |accessdate=February 28, 2011|quote=Murphy had to be waived before Tuesday to remain eligible for a playoff roster on a new team.

While having a steady season without making any real ground in the playoff race, the Warriors were breaking franchise records with 21 made 3's in a win against Orlando Magic. In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 3 pt shots made in a season with 184 in a home win versus the Los Angeles Lakers, beating Jason Richardson with the previous record of 183 in the 2005â06 season.

Wright also ended the season with the most [[3-point field goal|3 point shots]] made in the [[2010-11 NBA season|2010â11 season]] with 194, as well as the most 3-point field goals attempted with 516, both of which set new Warriors franchise records.

The Warriors failed to make the playoffs after a 36 win season in 2010â11, and as a result [[Keith Smart]] was relieved of his duties on April 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By ANTONIO GONZALEZ, AP Sports Writer Apr 27, 6:19&amp;nbsp;pm EDT |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news;_ylt=AvScJY9DZKcTtyPhYb9tVHo5nYcB?slug=ap-warriors-smartout |title=Warriors promise change, cut ties with coach Smart â NBA â Yahoo!

==Broadcasts==
===TV===
Joe Clarren [[Bob Fitzgerald]] does [[play-by-play]] and [[Jim Barnett (basketball)|Jim Barnett]] does [[color commentator|color commentary]] on [[Comcast SportsNet]] [[CSN Bay Area|Bay Area]]. Together, they do over 70 Warriors games a year on CSN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/warriors/news/Bob_Fitzgerald-28147-52.html |title=Bob Fitzgerald |publisher=Nba.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also host &quot;Roundtable Live&quot;, a half-hour pre-game show leading up to the broadcast of select Warriors home games. Bob is in his 11th season broadcasting Warriors games while Jim is in his 23rd season.  Matt Steinmetz and Scott Reese are the 3rd and 4th members of the broadcast team and do halftime and post-game analysis, while [[Jaymee Sire]] acts as the Warriors insider and sideline reporter.

===Radio===
[[Tim Roye]], who is in his 13th season doing Warrior games, does the [[play-by-play]] by himself without a [[color commentator]]. Exceptions are when the game is on national television, in which case, Jim Barnett (not doing TV) does color commentary. The games are broadcasted on [[KNBR]]-AM. Games at night, 7:30 [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], are broadcast on 680, while early starts on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] are broadcast on 1050 to avoid interrupting ''The Razor and Mr. T''. After each game, Tim Roye, [[Bob Fitzgerald]], and [[Jim Barnett (basketball)|Jim Barnett]] discuss the just-finished game and then they preview the upcoming games. [[Damon Bruce]] does the pre-game and post-game shows live from [[Oracle Arena]]. Major sponsors of the Warriors radio broadcast are [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)#Bud Light|Bud Light]], [[Lucky Stores|Lucky's]], and [[Corona (beer)|Corona Light]].
