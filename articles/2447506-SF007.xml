'''Maemo''' is a [[software platform]] developed by the Maemo community for [[smartphone]]s and [[Internet tablet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maemo.org/legal/terms_of_use/trademarks/ |title=Maemo Trademark |publisher=Maemo.org |accessdate=2009-08-29|date=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the [[Debian]] [[Linux distribution]], but has no relation to it. The platform comprises the Maemo operating system and the Maemo [[SDK]].

It is not [[Free and open source software|open source]] (though it uses some open source code) â to use or develop the device, proprietary software from Nokia is necessary.

Maemo is mostly based on [[Free and open source software|open source]] code, and has been developed by Maemo Devices within Nokia in collaboration with many open source projects such as the [[Linux kernel]], [[Debian]], and [[GNOME]]. Maemo is based on [[Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]] and draws much of its [[GUI]], [[software framework|frameworks]], and [[library (computing)|libraries]] from the [[GNOME]] project. It uses the [[Matchbox (window manager)|Matchbox]] window manager, and the [[GTK]]-based [[Hildon|Hildon framework]] as its [[GUI]] and [[application framework]].

The [[user interface]] in Maemo 4 is similar to many handheld interfaces, and features a &quot;home&quot; screen, which acts as a central point from which all applications and settings are accessed. The home screen is divided into areas for launching applications, a menu bar, and a large customisable area that can display information such as an RSS reader, Internet radio player, and Google search box. The Maemo 5 user interface is slightly different; the menu bar and info area are consolidated to the top of the display, and the four desktops can be customized with shortcuts and widgets.

At the Mobile World Congress in February 2010, it was announced that the Maemo project would be merging with [[Moblin]] to create the [[MeeGo]] mobile software platform.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== User Interface ==
=== OS2005âOS2008 ===
Up to Maemo 4 (AKA OS2008), the default screen is the &quot;Home&quot; screen â the central point from which all applications and settings are accessed. The Home Screen is divided into the following areas:
*Vertically down the left hand side of the screen is the taskbar, with applets for the web browser, communications, and application menu by default. Tthese can be modified using third party plugins (e.g. to provide a favorites or command menu).
*Horizontally across the top left half is the menu bar, which shows the application name and window title, and gives access to the application's menu (which contains the typical file, edit, view, tools, etc., menus and submenus).
*Horizontally across the top right quadrant is the status bar, containing icons such as battery life, wireless connection, volume, [[Bluetooth]] status, and brightness by default. These can be expanded using third party plugins in the same manner as the taskbar.
*The remaining large part of the display contains Home applets (roughly analogous to [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard widgets]]), which can display data as well as serving as a shortcut to applications. These include an RSS reader, Internet radio player, Google search box and contact list by default, but can also be expanded with third party plugins.

The interface uses either the touch screen, or a directional pad and select button, with separate back, menu, and home buttons. It is capable of receiving text input through handwriting recognition, two different sizes of onscreen keyboard and hardware keyboard input with the [[Nokia N810|N810]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2007/01/26/review_nokia_n800/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Maemo 5 (Fremantle) ===
The user interface in Maemo 5 is different to its predecessors. It provides four fully customizable (with the ability to add/remove widgets, move widgets around, change the background and customize shortcuts to applications/contacts) &quot;Home&quot; screens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/chanse/3911804566/sizes/l/ |title=Flickr Photo Download: My Nokia #N900 Panoramic Desktop |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; called Panorama Desktop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maemo.nokia.com/features/panorama-desktop/|title=Panorama desktops|publisher=maemo.nokia.com|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switching from one desktop to the others is done by sliding one's finger horizontally on the background. The dashboard is accessed via the upper left icon and shows all the running applications, in a manner similar to the ExposÃ© feature in Apple's [[Mac OS X]] operating system.  From the dashboard, running applications can be brought back to full screen by tapping the preview window, and applications can be closed by tapping an X-symbol located in the top right corner of the preview window, similar to the concept of closing applications in other operating systems. The application launcher, where all the installed applications can be launched, can also be accessed from the dashboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrYqemylpIo|title=YouTube â Nokia N900 hands-on|publisher=YouTube, LLC|date=2 September 2009|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG4qPv2k4Ak|title=YouTube â Hands-on with Nokia N900|publisher=YouTube, LLC|date=2 September 2009|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no task or application is running in the background, tapping the top left icon skips the dashboard and directly displays the application launcher.

Maemo provides the [[Mozilla]]-based [[MicroB]] web-browser with complete [[Adobe Flash]] support, which can operate over a wireless connection. It supports an 800x480 display resolution, so some web pages can be viewed without horizontal scrolling. It can automatically connect to known wireless networks, download RSS feeds and email and disconnect automatically without user intervention.&lt;ref name=arsn800&gt;{{cite web|last=Bangeman |first=Eric |url=http://arstechnica.com/reviews/hardware/n800.ars |title=Ars Technica review of the N800 |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software is installed or uninstalled using the application manager. The X Terminal can also be used to install applications using the &quot;apt-get&quot; command (although this is discouraged for inexperienced users). Users can subscribe to different [[software repositories]] which can then be used to automatically keep software up to date. The application manager also provides an overview of everything currently installed on the system. Data can be synchronized with a PC via a USB connection, and the user's files can be accessed using the standard Removable Storage Device protocol.&lt;ref name=arsn800/&gt;

A new update (Version 21.2011.38-1.002) was released onto the Nokia N900 on November 2nd, and was installed automatically. The new version mostly consists of security updates.

== Features ==
=== Updating ===
Maemo devices can be updated using a simple flashing method with a computer over USB.

Since Diablo (Maemo 4.1), Maemo supports &quot;Seamless Software Update&quot; (SSU), which allows incremental operating system upgrades &quot;over the air&quot; using the [[Advanced Packaging Tool]], without the need for a full flash with every update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/04/01/its-official-n810-wimax-announced/ |title=It's Official N810 WiMAX Announced |publisher=Internettablettalk.com |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flashing remains available as a way to start over from scratch with a clean installation (much like formatting a hard drive and reinstalling an operating system on a PC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/qgil/nokia-and-maemo-in-the-new-gnome-mobile-context/3 |title= Nokia and Maemo in the new GNOME mobile context |last= Gil |first= Quim |date= 2007-06-01 |page= 22 |format= FLV |accessdate= 28 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security ===
The quick start guide for developers warns that Maemo security concentrates on preventing remote attacks (e.g. by [[wireless networking]] and [[Bluetooth]]). It also warns that Maemo's [[superuser|root account]] has a trivial default password (user: gainroot, password: rootme) which needs to be changed before enabling remote access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =maemo 4 Quick Start Guide | publisher =Nokia | year =2007 | page =11 |url=http://maemo.org/development/documentation/maemo-quick-start-guide.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maemo employs a numeric security code as a way to lock the device's controls and display independently of the root password, to help prevent unauthorised access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Internet Tablet OS 2008 edition User Guide | publisher =Nokia | year =2007 | page =14 |url=http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/nam/phones/guides/N810_US_en.PDF|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Maemo is a modified version of the [[Debian]] [[Linux distribution]], slimmed down for mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://maemo.org/maemo_training_material/maemo4.x/html/maemo_Technology_Overview/Chapter_03_maemo_Platform_Overview.html |title= maemo Getting Started â maemo Platform Overview |accessdate = 2008-08-15|publisher=Nokia Corporation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080616191310/http://maemo.org/maemo_training_material/maemo4.x/html/maemo_Technology_Overview/Chapter_03_maemo_Platform_Overview.html |archivedate = June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses an [[X Window System]]-based [[graphical user interface]] using Xomap and the [[Matchbox (window manager)|Matchbox]] [[window manager]]. The GUI uses the [[GTK+]] toolkit and [[Hildon]] user interface [[widget (computing)|widget]]s and [[API]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://maemo.org/maemo_training_material/maemo4.x/html/maemo_Getting_Started/Chapter_01_What_is_maemo.html |title= maemo Getting Started â What is maemo? |accessdate = 2008-08-14|publisher=Nokia Corporation }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BusyBox]], a software package for embedded and mobile devices, replaces the [[GNU Core Utilities]] used in [[Debian]]-proper to reduce memory usage and storage requirements (at the expense of some functionality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |last= Abinader |first= Bruno |title= Re: Systemtap testsuite report for arm architecture |mailinglist= systemtap |date= 2008-04-01 |url= http://sources.redhat.com/ml/systemtap/2008-q2/msg00002.html |accessdate= 2008-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enlightened Sound Daemon|ESD]] is used as the primary sound server, and [[GStreamer]] is used by the shipped media player to play back sounds and movies. The formats supported by GStreamer can be extended by compiling GStreamer plugins in scratchbox ([[Maemo#Maemo SDK|Maemo SDK]]), which was done, for example, to bring [[Ogg]] support to the platform,&lt;ref&gt;[http://maemo.org/development/documentation/how-tos/4-x/getting_started_with_multimedia.html Maemo 4.x: Getting started with multimedia]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as experimental features such as [[WebM]] and [[VP8]] after they were announced by [[Google]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zaheer.merali.org/articles/2010/05/24/n900-and-maemo5-playing-vp8webm-live-stream/ |title=N900 and Maemo5 playing vp8/webm live stream |publisher=Zaheer.merali.org |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-party party media players can access GStreamer directly or via &quot;osso-media-server&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Window management is handled by the Matchbox window manager, which limits the screen to showing a single window at a time ([[Ubuntu Netbook Edition]] implements a similar system). This is to improve usability on a mobile device with a small screen.

Although Maemo is based on Linux and open source software, some parts of Maemo remain closed source. These include some user-space software, like certain status bar and taskbar applets (including the display brightness applet) and applications, and some system [[Daemon (computer software)|daemons]] related to connectivity and power management.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.maemo.org/Free_Maemo Freeing Maemo] On wiki.maemo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==
Maemo comes with a number of built-in applications, but additional applications can be installed from a number of sources, including various official and community [[software repository|software repositories]], and [[deb (file format)|deb]] files through either the built-in [[package management system|package manager]] &quot;Application manager&quot;, or the Advanced Packaging Tool and [[dpkg]]. Bundled applications include the [[Mozilla]]-based [[MicroB]] browser, [[Macromedia Flash]] player, [[Gizmo5]], and [[Skype]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nokia.us/A4626059 Nokia N810 Specifications] List of bundled applications&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third-party applications ===
Due in part to the [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]] nature of [[Linux]] and Maemo, [[porting]] applications to Maemo is a straightforward procedure. Because of this, there are many third-party applications available for the platform. Some applications are original software written specifically for Maemo, while other applications are straight ports of existing Linux programs. Some notable software includes:
; Media players: [[Canola (software)|Canola]] (with network streaming), [[MPlayer]]
; Internet: [[Claws Mail]], [[Modest (e-mail client)|Modest]], [[Midori (browser)|Midori]], [[Firefox for mobile]], [[Opera Mobile]]
; Office applications: [[Gnumeric]] (spreadsheet), [[Abiword]] (word processing)
; Instant Messaging: [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]]
; VOIP: [[Gizmo5]], [[Skype]]
; Games: [[The Battle for Wesnoth]], [[Wormux]], [[Doom (video game)|Doom]], [[Angry Birds]]
; Others: [[FBReader]] ([[e-book]] reader), [[GPE]] ([[OpenSync (software)|OpenSync]] compatible [[Personal information manager|PIM]]), [[rdesktop]] (RDP remote access), [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]] (subscription music, US only), [[ScummVM]] (game emulator), [[Free42S]] (HP 42S calculator emulator), [[gPodder]] (podcast client), [[Maemo-mapper|Maemo Mapper]] (includes GPS functionality), [[MaemoMyth]] ([[MythTV]] frontend that uses [[GMythStream]]), [[Monsoon HAVA]] (TV viewer and controller), [[Navit]] ([[GPS]] navigation software), [[Obscura Photo Manager]], [[Palm Emulator from Access]] (ARM based Palm emulator), [[Phonelink]] (SMS and voice caller via BT), [[Quiver Image Viewer]], [[SDict Viewer]] (sdict-based dictionary/encyclopedia viewer), [[Vagalume]] ([[Last.FM]] player), [[VNC]], [[YouAmp]] (music player), LogMeIn Browser Plugin

; Debian: [[Image:OpenOffice Writer in Maemo 5.jpg|thumb|200px|right|OpenOffice.org running on Maemo 5 using Easy Debian.]]The complete [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[Debian]] distribution can be installed as a Maemo application,&lt;ref name=&quot;easydebian&quot;/&gt; making thousands of software packages available (including [[OpenOffice.org]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the [[GNOME]] and [[LXDE]] desktops, etc.).  Debian [[ARM architecture|ARM]] packages can also be used if they are modified with the maemo-optify tool.&lt;ref name=maemooptify&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gitorious.org/maemo-af/maemo-optify/blobs/master/README|title=README â maemo-optify in Maemo Application Framework â Gitorious|publisher=Shortcut AS|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to run largely unmodified linux packages sets Maemo apart from other Linux-based [[mobile operating system]]s, such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[webOS]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Media support ===

Other media types, such as the audio format .OGG, can be added with the use of community plug-ins.

; Video: [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-4| MPEG-4 ASP (H.263)]], [[RealVideo]], [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]], [[3GP]]
; Audio/playlists: [[MP3]], [[RealAudio]], [[MPEG-4]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], [[WAV]], [[AMP (MP3 software)|AMP]], [[MP2 (format)|MP2]], AMR, AWB, M4A, WMA. OGG/Vorbis (requires addon package), M3U, PLS
; Image/Animation: [[JPEG]], [[Windows bitmap|BMP]], [[Tagged Image File Format|TIFF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG Tiny]], [[ICO (icon image file format)|ICO]]
; Text/layout: [[text file]]s, [[Portable Document Format|PDF]], [[HTML]].

== Software development ==
Software can be developed in [[C (programming language)|C]] using the Maemo SDK, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (which is supported by the Jalimo JVM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.evolvis.org/jalimo/index.php/Maemo |title=Maemo â Jalimo |language={{de icon}} |publisher=Wiki.evolvis.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Mono (software)|Mono]].

The Maemo SDK is based around the [[Debian]]-oriented [[Scratchbox|Scratchbox Cross Compilation Toolkit]], which provides a [[sandbox (software development)|sandbox]] environment in which development may take place. Scratchbox uses [[Qemu]] to emulate an ARM processor or [[sbrsh]] to remotely execute instructions. Scratchbox-compatible [[rootstrap]]s are available for both [[x86]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM]], so the majority of development and debugging takes place on x86, with final packaging being for ARM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maemo.org/maemo_training_material/maemo4.x/html/maemo_Technology_Overview/Chapter_05_Software_Development_Process_for_maemo_SDK.html#OverviewofthesoftwaredevelopmentprocessusingthemaemoSDKenvironment Overview of the software development process using the maemo SDK environment]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a new feature of the Maemo operating system, Maemo 5 offers the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] library as a community-supported component, alongside the officially supported [[GTK+]] backend. This will change with the Harmattan release, which will add the Qt library as the default, with GTK+ becoming community-supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/qgil/maemo-harmattan-qt-and-more|title=Maemo Harmattan Qt And More|publisher=SlideShare Inc.|date=4 July 2009|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The programming languages [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] will also be supported.

The NOKIA Developer Wiki community has articles about Qt development, and includes tutorials and articles about development for the Maemo operating system.

== Hardware ==
The Maemo operating system is designed for [[Nokia Internet Tablet]]s, which feature very similar specifications to Nokia's high-end [[Nokia Nseries|N-series]] and [[Nokia Eseries|E-series]] cellphones, with [[Texas Instruments|TI]] [[OMAP]] [[ARM Architecture|ARM]] [[system-on-a-chip|SoC]]s, large screens, and expandable internal storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum.nokia.com/devices/matrix_maemo_1.html |title=Device Specifications |publisher=Forum.nokia.com |date=2010-12-01 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the highly optimized, hardware-specific nature of Maemo renders its operation on non-Internet tablet hardware very difficult, most of the important non-proprietary parts of the operating system, along with some of the available third-party party applications, are actively being packaged for Debian and are available for use on other distributions, which will open up a large range of other hardware options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.debian.org/pkg-maemo |title=Debian Maemo packaging team |publisher=Wiki.debian.org |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nokia runs the Maemo operating system on the [[Nokia N900]].

== Version history ==
=== OS2005 ===
[[Image:Maemo desktop.jpg|thumb|OS2005 Desktop]]

Shipped with the [[Nokia 770|770]] in November 2005, this is the original Internet tablet OS. It came bundled with the [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] web browser, [[Adobe Flash|Flash 6]], basic [[email]] and [[RSS]] clients, [[audio player|audio]] and [[video]] players, [[PDF]] and image viewers, a graphical Advanced Packaging Tool, front-end (dubbed simply &quot;Application manager&quot;), and a variety of simple games and utilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5858395674.html 770 Device Profile] List of bundled applications for OS2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== OS2006 ===
[[Image:Itos 2006 dates.jpg|thumb|OS2006 showing Pimlico Dates]]

On May 16, 2006, Nokia announced a new version of [[Internet Tablet OS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.nokia.com/PR/200605/1051308_5.html |title=Nokia â The Nokia 770 Internet Tablet adds Internet calls and Instant Messaging support |publisher=Press.nokia.com |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was subsequentially released as a [[beta version]] for the [[Nokia 770|770]] on June 9, 2006 and as a production version on June 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS9255811301.html Nokia 770 Tablet &quot;OS 2006&quot; arrives] News article on OS2006 release&lt;/ref&gt; The update featured improved performance and stability, a built-in Google Talk client, a refreshed look, and a new full-screen finger keyboard. Because of significant API and architecture changes, existing applications required recompiling. It is the last officially supported Internet Tablet OS release for the 770.

Also included was the ability to support 2&amp;nbsp;GB RS-MMC cards ([[File Allocation Table|FAT]] formatted). The [[Linux kernel]] was upgraded to 2.6.16, with the associated patches for the OMAP platform included. This new version uses [[kernel preemption]] for improved interactivity.

=== OS2007 ===
[[Image:Itos 2007 desktop.jpg|thumb|OS2007 Desktop showing OMWeather]]

OS2007 was released and bundled with the [[Nokia N800|N800]] on January 8, 2007, after its unveiling at the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] 2007 summit. It featured significant bug fixes and performance improvements in almost all areas of the OS, bringing updated versions of the Opera web browser and [[Adobe Flash|Adobe Flash Player 7]], an updated interface and various API and library updates.

=== OS2008 ===
[[Image:Itos 2008 desktop.jpg|thumb|OS2008 Desktop]]

OS2008 was released with the [[Nokia N810|N810]] in November 2007, based on Linux 2.6.21, and featuring [[MicroB]], a new [[Mozilla]]-based web browser that replaces Opera. It also features integrated [[Samba (software)|Samba file sharing]] and additional support for Windows Media Player Formats and [[H.264]] and improved support for USB devices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibrado.org/2008/02/usb-in-os2008.html USB in OS2008] Article on OS2008 USB support&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forum.nokia.com/blog/kate-alholas-forum-nokia-blog/maemo/2008/01/21/usb-on-the-go USB On-The-Go] Kate Alhola's Forum Nokia Blog USB On-The-Go&lt;/ref&gt; among other incremental UI improvements (particularly in the direction of finger-friendliness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.nokia.com/A4579471|title=Nokia Europe â Nokia N810 â OS2008 features}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dynamic frequency scaling]] (between 165&amp;nbsp;MHz and 400&amp;nbsp;MHz) was also implemented, which gave the N800 a 70&amp;nbsp;MHz speed increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.maemo.org/pipermail/maemo-developers/2007-December/049275.html|title=Maemo-Developers Mailing List: Frequencies scaling with OS2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Diablo ====
Diablo is the codename for the OS2008 Feature Upgrade (corresponding to Maemo 4.1),&lt;ref name=&quot;codenames&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wiki.maemo.org/Codenames |title= Codenames |work= maemo.org Wiki |accessdate= 25 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; released in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maemo.org/news/announcements/os2008_feature_upgrade-reflash_your_tablet-for_the_last_time/ |title=OS2008 Feature Upgrade: reflash your tablet (for the last time?) |publisher=Maemo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major features include significant improvements to the built-in Application manager, incremental operating system upgrades without reflashing (&quot;Seamless Software Update&quot;, SSU), [[Modest (e-mail client)|Modest]] as the default mail client, and a new version of the [[MicroB]] browser with more optimizations and some interface improvements (though still based on the same [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] release as Chinook's MicroB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=17727 |title= What do we know about Diablo (Maemo 4.1) |work= Internet Tablet Talk forums |date= 2008-03-09 |accessdate= 28 April 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.maemoapps.com/2007/10/24/a-not-so-modest-update-to-email-is-coming/ |title= A not so modest update to email is coming |work= Featured Maemo Apps |date= 2007-10-24 |last= Greene |first= Jonathan |accessdate= 28 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diablo also included an implementation of the WiMAX stack for the short-lived N810 variation called [[Nokia N810#Nokia N810 WiMAX Edition|N810 WiMAX edition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nokiausa.com/find-products/phones/nokia-n810-wimax-edition |title= Nokia 810 WiMAX edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== SSU ====
SSU, in particular, is one of the most significant parts of the Diablo release, as it eliminates the flash-based upgrade system of previous Maemo releases which required the user to completely wipe their device with each upgrade. With SSU, the user can receive &quot;over-the-air&quot; updates. This also decouples bundled software updates from the major system updates, as was required with the flash-based method, so Nokia can release more frequent updates to individual packages than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nseries.com/index.html#l=workshop,articles,414 |title=Interview with Urho Konttori |publisher=Nseries.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first SSU update was pushed on August 11, 2008, and brought Diablo up to version 4.2008.30-2. The update primarily features MicroB, Modest, and connectivity framework updates as well as a number of other minor bugfixes.

=== Maemo 5 ===
[[Image:Maemo5-screenshot.png|thumb|Maemo 5 Screenshot]]
Maemo 5, also known as Fremantle,&lt;ref name=&quot;codenames&quot; /&gt; is the default operating system on the [[Nokia N900]].  The release features a much more finger-friendly and consistent user interface, and an [[X Window System|X-server]] based on [[Xorg]] rather than [[KDrive]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2564#c6 Bug 2564 â  No consistency on scrolling/scrollbars in bundled OS2008 applications]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1897#c6 Bug 1897 â Mouse support (Bluetooth and on 770 USB support)]&lt;/ref&gt; It also features several new technologies, including the [[Tracker (desktop search software)|Tracker]] search system, [[PulseAudio]] (replacing [[Enlightened Sound Daemon|ESD]]), the OHM hardware management daemon, the gUPnP [[UPnP]] framework, enhanced location framework, and [[Upstart]]. Several existing technologies have also been updated, including [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]], [[BlueZ]], [[gstreamer]] (will include [[OpenMAX]]), [[GTK+]], and [[Telepathy (software)|Telepathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internettablettalk.com/2008/09/18/osim-maemo-developer-session/ |title=OSiM Maemo Developer Session |publisher=Internettablettalk.com |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.maemo.org/Task:Maemo_roadmap/Fremantle Maemo Roadmap â Fremantle]&lt;/ref&gt;

Maemo 5 comes with new hardware, the [[Nokia N900]] featuring a [[Texas Instruments]] [[OMAP]]3 [[system-on-a-chip|SoC]], with an [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] modem and HD camera, which provides significant improvements in speed, [[3D computer graphics|3D]] acceleration, and media playback. It has been decided by Nokia that the commercial Maemo 5 platform releases will not be available on N800/N810 hardware, for compatibility reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?s=3b2f5dfc74e359ee7cbbcb895f23287c&amp;p=279460&amp;postcount=4 |title=Comment on talk.maemo.org by Gil Quim, Nokia employee |publisher=Talk.maemo.org |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An open source Linux project called Mer, a variant of Maemo, has been formed to provide an alternative, fully open operating system for mobile devices including the Nokia N800 and N810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mer-project.blogspot.com/ |title=Mer â a Mobile Linux Distribution|publisher=Blogspot|accessdate=10 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most smartphones, the end-user is able to gain root access by issuing the command &quot;sudo gainroot&quot; in the terminal in Maemo 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flors.wordpress.com/2009/08/27/software-freedom-lovers-here-comes-maemo-5/|title=Software freedom lovers: here comes Maemo 5 Â« flors|publisher=WordPress|date=27 August 2009|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device does not need to be unlocked or &quot;[[Jailbreak (iPhone OS)|jailbroken]]&quot; in order to install an unsupported application. The UK cellular operator Vodafone has its own branded, somewhat more restricted version of the Maemo 5 operating system. Users can flash (change) to the Global variant of the operating system if they wish.

The Maemo 5 operating system comes preloaded with a variety of applications such as:
; Web: Maemo Browser ([[Mozilla]] based [[web browser]] with [[Adobe Flash]] 9.4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maemo.nokia.com/features/maemo-browser/ |title=Maemo software &amp;#124; Nokia âº Maemo Browser |publisher=Maemo.nokia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;), RSS reader
; Phone application'''
; [[VoIP]]: [[Session initiation protocol]], [[Skype]]&lt;ref name=&quot;maemofeaturesphone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maemo.nokia.com/features/phone/|title=Maemo software â Nokia &gt; Phone|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Conversations''' ([[Instant messaging|IM]] chat and [[SMS]], no [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=318414&amp;postcount=419|title=maemo.org â Talk â View Single Post â Now it's official: Maemo 5 and the N900 launch!|date=30 August 2009|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
; Media: Camera, Photos, Media player
; Production: Email, Calendar, [[PDF]] reader, Contacts
; [[Ovi Maps]]''' (Find position on a map using the [[GPS]], Search an address or location, Plan routes)
; Utilities: Clock, Notes, Calculator, Sketch
; System Tools: File manager, Application manager for downloads, [[GUI widget|Widgets]]
; Games: Bounce, [[Chess]], Blocks, Marbles and [[Mahjong]]

Nokia expects the open source community to play a large part in the development of applications for Maemo 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzNbPAgcHMw|title=YouTube â Who will create applications for Nokia N900?|publisher=YouTube, LLC|date=6 September 2009|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Nokia has launched a contest at the onedotzero festival in London called PUSH N900 aimed at designers, artists, hackers and modders.  The contest invites participants &quot;''to connect the N900 to something you love.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nokia.com/pushn900/index.php/what-is-push/|title=What is PUSH N900 | Nokia PUSH|publisher=Nokia Corporation|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 1500 additional applications (mostly free to download and use) have been created by third-party party developers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://my-maemo.com/software/ Complete Maemo 5 Software Directory at My-Maemo.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hacker Editions ===
Nokia's release of the [[Nokia N800|N800]] in January 2007 included Internet Tablet OS 2007. OS2007 ran only on the N800 and Nokia had no plans to release it for the [[Nokia 770|770]]; however feedback from disgruntled 770 owners&lt;ref&gt;[http://jaaksi.blogspot.com/2007/01/were-getting-some-feedback-and-weve-got.html We're getting some feedback .. and we've got a plan now] Ari Jaaksi's blog post on OS2007 for 770&lt;/ref&gt; led Nokia to release an unsupported hybrid of OS2006 and OS2007, dubbed Internet Tablet OS 2007 Hacker Edition, in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notacloud.com/blog/?p=27 First release of OS 2007 / 770 hacker edition out] Announcement of first OS2007 HE release on Carlos Guerreiro's blog&lt;/ref&gt; OS2007HE combined the binary parts of OS2006 with most of the updated libraries and user-space applications of OS2007.

Nokia followed the release of the N810 and OS2008 in November 2007 with the OS2008 Hacker Edition for the 770 on February 14, 2008, employing a similar method to the OS2007HE release to create a hybrid between OS2006 and OS2007. The Hacker Editions allow 770 users to access the latest Internet Tablet OS releases and third-party software, although due to the 770's hardware limitations and the increased CPU requirements of OS2008, performance is inferior to that of OS2007 HE in most areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maemo.org/news/announcements/internet_tablet_hacker_edition_pushed_at_chinook_level/ Internet Tablet Hacker Edition pushed at Chinook level] Announcement of the first OS2008 HE release&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative desktops ===
In addition to the officially supported Hildon environment that comes standard on the tablets, several alternate desktop systems are available. Penguinbait, a member of the Internet Tablet Talk community, has successfully ported [[KDE 3]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=14680 |title=KDE/Koffice Install made easy for everyone |publisher=Internettablettalk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Openbox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5126 |title=OPENBOX-ROX Now Available |publisher=Internettablettalk.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[XFCE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9678 |title=http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=9678 XFCE Available |publisher=Internettablettalk.com |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the N800 and N810 (the N770 is able to run an early version of the KDE port). A port of [[KDE 4]] is currently being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geekpenguin.blogspot.com/2008/04/why-not-skip-ahead.html |title=Why Not Skip Ahead? (KDE4 for ITs) |publisher=Geekpenguin.blogspot.com |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LXDE]] is the default desktop for the &quot;[[Easy Debian]]&quot; distribution, which is installed as a single application under Maemo but provides access to the full range of software in the ARM [[Debian]] distribution (including GIMP, Iceweasel/Firefox and OpenOffice) &lt;ref name=&quot;easydebian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qole.blogspot.com/2008/10/easy-debian-moves-to-extras-devel.html|title=Easy Debian moves to Extras|date=2008-10-12|author=Qole Pejorian}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a [[chroot]] environment.

==== Mer ====

Mer is a completely open-source alternative operating system for the [[N800]] and [[N810]] (collectively known as the N8x0 devices). It is based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 9.04, and with the release of Maemo 5/Fremantle, a new goal has emerged: &quot;[To bring] as much of Fremantle as we can get on the N8x0.&quot;

Mer has halted further development, at release 0.17, and the former developers have begun focusing on building MeeGo for the N800 and N810 devices.

==== Harmattan ====
Little is known about Harmattan except for the plans to bundle officially supported [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] libraries with it in place of [[GTK+]]/[[Hildon]], as well as improved power profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/qgil/maemo-harmattan-qt-and-more |title=Maemo Harmattan Qt and More |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2009-07-04 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugs.maemo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1046 Bug 1046 â RFE: Power Management Profiles (AC/Battery, Timed, Environment and screen saver)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MeeGo ====

{{Main|MeeGo}}

In the wake of the release of the MeeGo code base, there are two main community efforts to bring MeeGo to the current Maemo devices (N800, N810, and N900), as Nokia has launched the N9, which is powered by MeeGo. These efforts are the MeeGo adaptation for the N800 and N810 devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=48929 |title=MeeGo hardware adaptation for N8x0 - maemo.org - Talk |publisher=Talk.maemo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.meego.com/showthread.php?t=317| title=Unofficial MeeGo hardware adaptation for Nokia N8x0  | publisher=meego.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the MeeGo to N900 project. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=50763 |title=Brief status of &quot;MeeGo to N900&quot; project - maemo.org - Talk |publisher=Talk.maemo.org |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Qt ====
In January 2008, Nokia began the process of acquiring [[Trolltech]], the developer of the [[Qt (framework)|Qt]] application framework. Nokia has since announced plans for the Qt libraries to be bundled with Maemo by [[Fiscal year|Q4]] 2008, though without a platform-specific &quot;[[hildon]]ized&quot; user interface as is offered with [[GTK]] (meaning Qt applications will look different from hildonized GTK applications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://maemo.org/news/announcements/view/qt_to_be_supported_in_addition_to_gtk.html |title= Qt to be supported in addition to GTK+ |accessdate= 28 April 2008 |work= maemo.org Announcements |date= 2008-04-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080420031623/http://maemo.org/news/announcements/view/qt_to_be_supported_in_addition_to_gtk.html |archivedate = April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jaaksi.blogspot.com/2008/04/ctia-and-qt.html |title= CTIA and Qt |accessdate= 28 April 2008 |work= Ari Jaaksi's Blog |last= Jaaksi |first= Ari |date= 2008-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This will make porting of Qt applications to the platform easier for developers, and make new applications available to users. Qt support on [[S60 platform|S60]] devices will likely lead to cross-platform application sharing between the two platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://flors.wordpress.com/2008/01/29/gnomes-trolls-and-the-maemo-lands/ |title= Gnomes, trolls and the Maemo lands |accessdate= 27 April 2008 |work= flors |last= Gil |first= Quim |date= 2008-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2008/04/23/nokia-internet-tablets-get-ubuntu-and-qt  |title= Nokia Internet Tablets get Ubuntu and Qt |accessdate= 27 April 2008 |work= Ars Technica |last= Paul |first= Ryan |date= 2008-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement has been met with mixed reactions in the developer community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/3233 |title= digesting the Trolltech acquisition |accessdate= 27 April 2008 |work= oever's blog |last= van den Oever |first= Jos |date= 2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.forum.nokia.com/blog/mark-wilcoxs-forum-nokia-blog/general/2008/02/03/trolltech-linux-open-source-the-future |title= Trolltech, Linux, Open Source, the future? |accessdate= 27 April 2008 |work= Mark Wilcox's Forum Nokia Blog |last= Wilcox |first= Mark |date= 2008-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release history ==
=== Naming ===

Maemo Codenames are named for winds. For example, the latest release, codenamed &quot;Fremantle,&quot; is a reference to the [[Fremantle Doctor]], the Western Australian vernacular term for the cooling afternoon sea breeze which occurs during summer months in south west coastal areas of Western Australia.

== Maemo Summit ==
In 2008 and 2009, Maemo developers and users gathered at the Maemo Summit, the registration for which was free. Each participant got a badge and a Maemo T-shirt.

The 2009 Maemo Summit was held in [[Amsterdam]] on October 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009 |title=Maemo Summit 2009 |publisher=Wiki.maemo.org |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first day was the Nokia day, with the other two days dedicated to community contributions. Nearly 400 developers attended the summit. Nokia gave out 300 [[Nokia N900|N900]] devices to independent developers during the summit.

The 2009 Maemo Summit was also the last Maemo Summit since MeeGo was launched. The event was replaced by the MeeGo Conference.
