'''Google Checkout''' is an online payment processing service provided by [[Google]] aimed at simplifying the process of paying for online purchases. Users store their [[Credit card|credit]] or [[debit card]] and shipping information in their Google Account, so that they can purchase at participating stores by clicking an on-screen button. Google Checkout provides [[fraud]] protection and a unified page for tracking purchases and their status.

Google Checkout service became available in the United States on June 28, 2006, and in the UK on April 13, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6549643.stm Google unveils UK payments system] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;  It was free for merchants until February 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://checkout.google.com/seller/freetransactions.html | title = No Processing fees until February 1, 2008 | accessdate =  | work = Google Checkout Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; From then until May 5, 2009 Google charged US merchants 2.0% plus $0.20 per transaction, and UK merchants 1.4% + Â£0.20. Google since moved to a tiered cost structure, identical to that of PayPal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://checkout.google.com/seller/fees.html | title = Google Checkout - Fees | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also since this date, Google has discontinued its offer whereby merchants who advertised with an [[AdWords]] account were not charged fees on monthly transactions totaling less than ten times their monthly AdWords expenditure.

Google Checkout also has a program which allows US IRS Certified 501(c)3 Non-Profit organizations to collect donations online without being charged the standard fee (2.9% + $0.30 per transaction under $3,000 monthly income, with lower rates for larger volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2006 [[eBay]], which owns [[PayPal]], added Google Checkout to its banned payment methods list, forbidding the use of Google Checkout to pay for eBay transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://auctionbytes.com/cab/abn/y06/m07/i06/s02 | title = eBay Bans Sellers from Using Google Checkout | accessdate =  | last = Steiner | first = Ina | date =  | publisher = AuctionBytes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/01/ebay-to-ban-google-checkout-in-june-2011-what-about-that-paypal-android-deal/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6091240-7.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.com/blog/micro-markets/google-checkout-vs-ebay-pay-pal-where-is-the-competition/359&lt;/ref&gt;
