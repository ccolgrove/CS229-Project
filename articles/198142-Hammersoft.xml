'''Saint David's Day''' ({{lang-cy|Dydd GÅµyl Dewi}}) is the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Saint David]], the [[patron saint]] of [[Wales]], and falls on 1 March each year. The date of 1 March was chosen in remembrance of the death of Saint David. Tradition holds that he died on that day in 589.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04640b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: ''St. David'']&lt;/ref&gt; The date was declared a national day of celebration within Wales in the 18th century.

Cross-party support resulted in the [[National Assembly for Wales]] voting unanimously to make St. David's Day a public holiday in 2000, a stance supported by the [[Wales TUC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dewi Sant 1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=WalesOnline - News - Wales News - New Bank holiday mooted â but don't start celebrating|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/07/28/new-bank-holiday-mooted-but-don-t-start-celebrating-91466-24252956/|accessdate=2010-03-02|publisher=[[Media Wales Ltd]]|date=28 July 2009|work=[[WalesOnline]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted for Saint David's Day in 2006 found that 87% of people in Wales wanted it to be a [[bank holiday]], with 65% prepared to sacrifice a different bank holiday to ensure this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4760362.stm |title=Poll backs St David's Day holiday  |author=Guto Thomas |publisher=BBC News |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition in 2007 to make St. David's Day a bank holiday was rejected by office of the then British Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page11078.asp Bank-Holiday - epetition reply: ''Prime Minister rejects petition to make St David's Day holiday''], 10 Downing Street.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The significance of St. David's Day==
{{Main|Saint David}}

St. David ({{lang-cy|Dewi Sant}}) was born towards the end of the fifth century. He was a scion of the royal house of Ceredigion, and founded a Celtic monastic community at Glyn Rhosin (The Vale of Roses) on the western headland of Sir Benfro, at the spot where [[St David's Cathedral]] stands today. David's fame as a teacher and ascetic spread throughout the Celtic world. His foundation at Glyn Rhosin became an important Christian [[shrine]], and the most important centre in Wales. The date of Dewi Sant's death is recorded as 1 March, but the year is uncertain â possibly 588. As his tearful monks prepared for his death St David uttered these words: 'Brothers be ye constant. The yoke which with single mind ye have taken, bear ye to the end; and whatsoever ye have seen with me and heard, keep and fulfil'.

For centuries the first of March has been a national festival. St David was recognised as a national patron saint at the height of Welsh resistance to the Normans.  St David's day was celebrated by the [[diaspora]] from an early period: the 17th century diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] noted how Welsh celebrations in London for St David's day would spark wider countercelebrations amongst their English neighbours: life-sized effigies of Welshmen were symbolically lynched, and by the 18th century the custom had arisen of confectioners producing 'Taffies' â [[gingerbread]] figures baked in the shape of a Welshman riding a goat - on St David's Day&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Jacqueline and Steve Roud (2000), Oxford Dictionary of English Folklore,
Oxford: Oxford University Press, pages 307-8.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

In 2003 in the United States, St. David's Day was recognised officially as the national day of the Welsh, and on 1 March the [[Empire State Building]] was floodlit in the national colours, red, green and white. It is invariably celebrated by Welsh societies throughout the world with dinners, parties, recitals and concerts.

To celebrate this day, people wear a symbol of either a [[leek]], or [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodil]].   The leek arises from an occasion when a troop of Welsh were able to distinguish each other from a troop of English enemy dressed in similar fashion by wearing leeks. An alternative emblem developed in recent years is the daffodil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidmorgan.com/stdavid.html] â Dydd Dewi Sant on davidmorgan.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the poem ''[[Armes Prydein|Armes Prydain]]'', composed in the early to mid-tenth century AD, the anonymous author prophesises that the Cymry (the [[Welsh people]]) will unite and join an alliance of fellow-Celts to repel the Anglo-Saxons, under the banner of St David: ''A lluman glÃ¢n Dewi a ddyrchafant'' (''And they will raise the pure banner of Dewi'').&lt;ref&gt;Ifor Williams (ed.), ''Armes Prydein'' (University of Wales Press, 1955), line 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[St David's Hall]] staged its traditional St Davidâs Day concert in the evening of 1 March with the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]], [[BBC National Chorus of Wales]] and youth choruses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dewi Sant 11&quot;/&gt;

===Other locations===

Public celebrations of St. David's Day are becoming more commonplace. In many towns an annual parade through the centre of town is now held. Concerts are held in pubs, clubs, and other venues.

In the town of [[Colwyn Bay]] in north Wales, an annual parade through the centre of town is now held with several hundred citizens and schoolchildren taking part. Other events are centred around the parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQPv8mWRcVo. youtube.com] Video of 2007 Colwyn Bay St. Davids's Day Parade&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Swansea]] inaugurated a [[St David's Week]] festival in 2009 with a range of musical, sporting and cultural events held throughout the city to mark the national day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintdavidsday.com St David's Week in Swansea]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==

Children in Wales take part in school concerts or [[eisteddfod]]au, with recitation and singing being the main activities. Formerly, a half-day holiday was afforded to school children. Officially this custom does not continue, although the practice can vary on a school-to-school basis.

Many Welsh people wear one or both of the national emblems of Wales on their lapel to celebrate St. David: the [[daffodil]] (a generic Welsh symbol which is in season during March) or the [[Leek (vegetable)|leek]] (Saint David's personal symbol) on this day. The association between leeks and daffodils is strengthened by the fact that they have similar names in Welsh, '''Cenhinen''' (leek) and '''Cenhinen Pedr''' (daffodil, literally &quot;Peter's leek&quot;). Younger girls sometimes wear traditional Welsh costumes to school. This costume consists of a long woollen skirt, white blouse, woollen shawl and a [[Welsh hat]].

The [[flag of Saint David]] often plays a central role in the celebrations and can be seen flying throughout Wales.

[[Cawl]] is frequently prepared and consumed on St. David's Day.
