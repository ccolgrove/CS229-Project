==History==
Competitive [[American football|football]] began on the Boulder campus in 1890. Early games, which bore more resemblance to [[rugby football|rugby]] than modern football, were played against the [[Colorado School of Mines|School of Mines]] and [[Utah Utes football|Utah]]. The football stadium, originally named &quot;Colorado Stadium,&quot; was officially named [[Folsom Field]] in November 1944 to honor Coach [[Fred Folsom]], one of the most respected [[college football]] coaches of his day.

In 1934, the university's intercollegiate teams were officially nicknamed the &quot;Buffaloes.&quot; Previous nicknames used by the press included the &quot;Silver Helmets&quot; and &quot;Frontiersmen.&quot; The final game of 1934, against the [[Denver Pioneers|University of Denver]], saw also the first running of a [[American bison|bison]] in a Colorado football game. A bison calf was rented from a local ranch and ran along the sidelines.

The year 1947 marked key point in race relations on campus. The Buffaloes joined the [[Big Eight Conference|Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association]], commonly known as the Big Six, then to be known as the Big Seven, and later the Big Eight, and since 1996 the Big 12 (although the Big 12 does not claim the Big Eight's history as its own). However, [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]] and [[Oklahoma Sooners|Oklahoma]] had rules which would have allowed them to challenge teams with &quot;colored&quot; players. A student outcry, led by campus paper ''Silver and Gold'', led to a movement against these Jim Crow restrictions which expanded to all the campuses of the Big 7 and eventually lead to their repeal.

On June 10, 2010, the Buffaloes announced that they would [[2010 NCAA conference realignment|join]] the [[Pacific-12 Conference]] in all sports beginning on July 1, 2011, leaving the [[Big 12 Conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pac-10.org&quot;/&gt;

===National championships===
The University of Colorado Buffaloes have won 24 team national championships, 23 NCAA titles and one AIAW championship, the women's predecessor to the NCAA:

*[[NCAA Skiing team championship|Skiing]] ('''18'''): 1959, 1960, 1972â1979, 1982 (both Men's and Women's in the final year before the sport became co-ed, men's NCAA and women's AIAW), 1991, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2006, 2011

*[[NCAA Division I-A national football champions|Football]] ('''1'''): 1990&lt;ref&gt;The NCAA does not conduct a championship for Division I-A football. Instead, teams are awarded championships by various private organizations. Currently the recognized championships are awarded by the [[Associated Press]] [[AP Poll|poll]] and the [[Bowl Championship Series]]âhowever not always in unison.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The University of Colorado was a member of the Colorado Football Association in 1893, and became a charter member of the [[Colorado Faculty Athletic Conference]] in 1909, which changed its name a year later to [[Rocky Mountain Faculty Athletic Conference]] (RMFAC). Colorado left the RMFAC to become a charter member of the [[Mountain States Conference]] (a.k.a. Skyline Conference) in 1938. CU joined the [[Big Eight Conference|Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] in 1947, then commonly known as the Big Six, changing the common name to the Big Seven. In 1958, the conference added [[Oklahoma State University|OSU]] to became the [[Big Eight Conference]]. It remained the Big 8 until 1996, when it combined with four member schools of the defunct [[Southwest Conference]] (Texas, Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, and Baylor) to create the [[Big 12 Conference]].  On July 1, 2011, the school joined the [[Pacific-12 Conference]] along with Utah.  A total of 12 of CU's 16 varsity sports compete in the Pac-12, except the ski teams and indoor track &amp; field teams.  The ski teams participate in the [[Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association]] (RMISA), of which is has been a member since 1947, along with fellow Pac-12 newcomer Utah.  The indoor track &amp; field teams will participate in the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation]] as the Pac-12 doesn't sponsor indoor track.

Â¹ Invitations

===Women's basketball===
{{main|Colorado Buffaloes women's basketball}}
Women's Basketball started at Colorado in 1975. The team has had seven coaches and the current coach is [[Linda Lappe]].

===Skiing===
The CU ski team competes as a member of the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association, as CU is one of two members of the Pac-12 along with Utah that competes in skiing.  Colorado is one of the dominant programs in the NCAA in skiing, winning '''17''' [[NCAA Skiing team championship|National Championships]], most recently in 2011.  The Buffs also have one AIAW championship for 18 total national championships.  The Buffs had finished second at the national championships the past three seasons, prior to winning the title in 2011. The Buffaloes have won 25 RMISA championships, most recently in 2011.  The Buffaloes have had 50 individuals connected to the school participate in the Olympics 80 times.  Colorado has had 83 individual NCAA Champions, including Reid Pletcher in the men's 20K classical race, and Eliska Hajkova in the women's 15K classical race, in 2011.  Pletcher and Hajkova used the exact same pair of skis to win their individual titles just an hour or so apart.

===Cross Country===
Being at such a high altitude helps the runners in training. Colorado has won three [[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship]]s (2001, 2004, and 2006) and two [[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]s (2000 and 2004). The men's team also has won three individual titles ([[Adam Goucher]], [[Jorge Torres]], and [[Dathan Ritzenhein]]), while the women's side has won one ([[Kara Goucher]]). The men won the first 12 Big 12 Conference Titles in the Conference's history and the women won 11 of the first 12 (all but 1998-99), with the two teams combining for 23 of the 32 championships awarded before the Buffs left the Big 12 to join the Pac-12 in 2011.

===Baseball===
Baseball, along with men's and women's gymnastics, men's and women's swimming and women's diving comprised seven sports that were discontinued on June 11, 1980 due to Title IX. The 1979-80 season was the last year of competition for the Buffaloes baseball team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=600&amp;ATCLID=28035&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Buffaloes==
*[[Byron White]] was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] after his football career.
*[[Hale Irwin]], who was a two-time All-Big Eight defensive back and an NCAA individual golf champion at Colorado, went on to spectacular success in professional golf. He won three [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Opens]] and 17 other [[PGA Tour]] events, and is the all-time leader in both wins and career prize money on the 50-and-over [[Champions Tour]].
*[[Adam Goucher]] is currently a professional runner who competed for the [[United States]] in the 2000 Olympic Games.
*[[Chauncey Billups]] is a former starting [[point guard]] for the [[Denver Nuggets]]. He was named the [[National Basketball Association Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]] in [[2004 NBA Finals|2004]]
*[[Jeremy Bloom]] played football and skied internationally finishing 6th in the [[2006 Winter Olympics]] in the moguls and is currently in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. He also sued the NCAA and lost, having to give up football for Colorado in 2004 because he received endorsement money for skiing.
*[[Bill Toomey]] won the gold medal in the [[decathlon]] at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]
*[[Jimmie Heuga]], [[Alpine skiing at the 1964 Winter Olympics|1964 Olympic]] bronze medalist, and [[Spider Sabich]] were both CU [[Alpine skiing|alpine ski racers]] from [[Northern California|northern]] [[California]].&lt;br&gt;([[Billy Kidd]], 1964 Olympic silver medalist, is a CU alumnus, but did not race for the Buffs.&lt;br&gt;He skied for the [[University of Vermont]] before joining the [[United States Ski Team|U.S. Ski Team]], and later finished his bachelor's degree in Boulder.)

==Rivalries==
===University of Nebraska===
{{main|Colorado-Nebraska rivalry}}
A traditional college football rivalry with the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln|University of Nebraska]] [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Cornhuskers]] re-started in the 1980s (many historical documents show the importance of this game going back to 1898) when Bill McCartney declared the conference opponent to be their rival. His theory was since Nebraska was such a powerhouse team, if Colorado was able to beat them then they would be a good team. Colorado began to repeatedly threaten Nebraska in the late 1980s, following their win over the Huskers in 1986, and then surpassed the Huskers for the Big 8 crown in 1989. 

In 1990, Colorado beat Nebraska 27&amp;ndash;12 in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], for the first time in 23 years, en route to their first national championship. Between 1996 and 2000, the series was extremely competitive, with the margin of victory by NU in those five years being only 15 points combined. The rivalry was further buoyed by the introduction of the Big 12 Conference in 1996, which moved [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]] &amp; [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] to the southern division with the four new schools from Texas, formerly in the [[Southwest Conference]].  Nebraska had traditionally finished the Big 8 conference schedule with a rivalry game with [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], but the two were now in different divisions, which meant they met every other year in the regular season.  Colorado replaced Oklahoma as Nebraska's final conference game of the regular season, which further intensified the CU-NU rivalry. In [[2001 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|2001]] Nebraska came to Folsom Field undefeated and left at the short end of a nationally televised 62&amp;ndash;36 loss. Other sports have then taken on Nebraska also as their rival.  Both teams departed the Big 12 in 2011, as NU headed east to join the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and the future of the rivalry is in doubt.

Nebraska currently leads the football series against Colorado 47&amp;ndash;17&amp;ndash;2.

===Colorado State University===
Colorado's in-state rival is [[Colorado State University]] of the [[Mountain West Conference]], located north of Boulder in [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]]. The two schools are separated by 45 miles (72 km) and both consider it important and noteworthy to beat the other for bragging rights for the next year. The two football teams annually compete in the [[Rocky Mountain Showdown]] for the Centennial Cup, played in [[Denver]] and Boulder.  The trophy takes its name from the state of [[Colorado]]'s nickname of &quot;The Centennial State.&quot;

Colorado currently leads the football series against Colorado State 59-20-2.

===University of Utah===
{{main|UtahâColorado football rivalry}}
The intercollegiate rivalry with the [[University of Utah]] ran from 1903 through 1962, in which [[Utah Utes football|Utah]] and [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] played each other nearly every year; through 1962 they had met 57 times.&lt;ref name =&quot;head-to-head&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/big12/colorado/opponents_records.php?teamid=3345| title=Colorado vs Utah| publisher=College Football Data Warehouse| accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, it was the second-most played rivalry for both teams (Utah had played [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]] 62 times;&lt;ref name =&quot;Utah vs Utah State&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/utah/opponents_records.php?teamid=3351| title=Utah vs Utah St.| publisher=College Football Data Warehouse| accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado had played [[Colorado State Rams football|Colorado State]] 61 times&lt;ref name =&quot;Colorado vs Colorado State&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/big12/colorado/opponents_records.php?teamid=768| title=Colorado vs Colorado St.| publisher=College Football Data Warehouse| accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The rivalry was discontinued in 1963, and the teams have not played each other since. Utah and Colorado will join the [[Pacific-12 Conference|Pac-12]] in 2011 and will be in the same six-team division, renewing the rivalry on an annual basis.  The Utah-Colorado rivalry remains the fifth-most played rivalry in Utah's history, and the eighth-most played rivalry in Colorado's history.&lt;ref name =&quot;Utah Opponents&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/mountainwest/utah/opponents.php| title=Utah Opponents|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse| accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Colorado Opponents&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/big12/colorado/opponents.php| title=Colorado Opponents|publisher=College Football Data Warehouse| accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- As of 06/30/10 --&gt;

==Traditions==
The University has had several fight songs that have lost and gained popularity over the years. The oldest, &quot;Glory Colorado&quot;, is sung to the tune of &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; and has been around nearly as long as the school. Glory Colorado is considered to represent all campuses of the University. &quot;Go Colorado&quot; was originally sung exclusively by the Glee Club at football games, though it is now played and known almost exclusively by members of the Golden Buffalo Marching Band. The most popular of the three fight songs and the most widely recognized is &quot;Fight CU.&quot; Originally sung by the football team, the song has gained enough popularity that few people outside the band know that it is not the only fight song of the university. The original version included the line &quot;fight, fight for every yard&quot; but the line was changed to &quot;fight, fight for victory&quot; to allow the song to be used for all sports, not just football.

===Mascots===
{{main|Ralphie}}
The two mascots present at all football games are '''[[Ralphie]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/lists/coolest-mascots-photo-gallery?gt1=39002#sport=CFB&amp;photo=11792896 College football's 12 coolest mascots: 1. Ralphie the Buffalo, Colorado]. FoxSports.com. Retrieved 2010-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; a live [[American Bison|buffalo]], and '''Chip''', a costumed mascot who was selected to the 2003 Capital One All-America Mascot Team and won the 2009 and 2010 UCA Mascot National Championships. Ralphie is actually Ralphie V and leads the football team onto the field at the beginning of the first and second halves. The tradition began in 1934 after the selection of ''Buffaloes'' as a nickname when a group of students paid $25 to rent a buffalo calf and cowboy as his keeper for the last game of the season. The calf was the son of Killer, a famed bison at Trails End Ranch in [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins, CO]]. It took the cowboy and four students to keep the calf under control on the sidelines during the game, a 7-0 win at the University of Denver on Thanksgiving Day.

===Colors===
The official school colors are [[Silver (color)|silver]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], adopted in 1888 as a symbol of the mineral wealth of the state. In 1959, the athletic teams started using [[black]] and [[yellow]], because silver and gold ended up looking like dirty white and dirty yellow. The colors have stuck and many are unaware that the official school colors are silver and gold. 

On May 28, 1981, black was curiously replaced by &quot;[[Sky Blue]]&quot; by a mandate of the CU Board of Regents, to represent the color of the Colorado sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;colorlogo&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.helmethut.com/College/Colorado/coloradoindex.html | title=Colorado | publisher=Helmet Hut | accessdate=2006-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this color was different than the blue uniforms of the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]]. After three years, the blue was changed in [[1984 in sports|1984]] to a darker shade, though still unpopular. In black and white photographs the players' numbers are nearly invisible. During a difficult 1-10 season in 1984, football [[head coach]] [[Bill McCartney]] employed black &quot;throwback&quot; jerseys for an emotional lift for the games against [[1984 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] and [[1984 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]], without success.

In April [[1985 in sports|1985]], the CU athletic teams were given the option of blue or black. The football team chose to wear black, and at [[Folsom Field]] the background for the signature &quot;Colorado&quot; arc (at the base of the seats behind the south end zone), blue for four years, was repainted black as well. On the football uniforms, the blue was reduced to a stripe on the sleeve for three seasons (1985â87) before being dropped completely in [[1988 in sports|1988]]. In [[2007 in sports|2007]], CU debuted new football jerseys that reintegrated [[Silver (color)|silver]] as a uniform color.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3843&amp;SPID=255&amp;DB_OEM_ID=600&amp;ATCLID=920540 CU Unveils New Football Uniforms - CUBuffs.comâOfficial Athletics Web site of the University of Colorado&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
