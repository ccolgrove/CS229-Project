'''Guerrero''' ({{IPA-es|É¡eËreÉ¾o}}) officially ''Estado Libre y Soberano de Guerrero'' ({{lang-en|Free and Sovereign State of Guerrero}}) is one of the 31 states which, with the [[Mexico City|Federal District]], comprise the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided in [[Municipalities of Guerrero|81 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Chilpancingo]].

It is located in [[Southwestern Mexico]]. It is bordered by the states of [[MichoacÃ¡n]] to the north and west, [[State of MÃ©xico|MÃ©xico]] and [[Morelos]] to the north, [[Puebla]] to the northeast and [[Oaxaca]] to the east.

The state was named after [[Vicente Guerrero]], one of the most prominent leaders in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] and the second [[President of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nomen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero  |title= Estado de Guerrero Nomenclatura|year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Guerrero Nomenclature |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only [[Mexican state]] named after a president. The modern entity did not exist until 1849, when it was carved out of territories from the states of [[Mexico State|Mexico]], [[Puebla]] and [[MichoacÃ¡n]].

In addition to the capital city, the state's largest cities include [[Acapulco]], [[Petatlan]], [[Ciudad Altamirano]], [[Taxco]], [[Iguala]], [[Ixtapa]], [[Zihuatanejo]], and [[Santo Domingo]]. Today, it is home to a number of indigenous communities, including the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]], [[Mixtec]]s and [[Amuzgo]]s. It is also home to communities of [[Afro-Mexican]]s in the [[Costa Chica of Guerrero|Costa Chica]] region.

Geographically, the state is mountainous and rugged with flat areas limited to small [[mesa]]s and the coast line. This coastline has been important economically for the area, first as the port of Acapulco in colonial and post-Independence area and today for the tourist destinations of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa. Tourism is the single most important economic factor of the state and Acapulcoâs tourism is important to the nationâs economy as a whole. However, other sources of employment are scarce in the state, which has caused its ranking as number one in the emigration of workers to the United States. In addition, the state of Guerrero is currently the most violent state in [[Mexican Drug War|Mexico's Drug War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guerrero se convierte en el estado mÃ¡s violento de MÃ©xico|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb0JiZ7SbTc&amp;feature=feedwll&amp;list=WL|newspaper=Noticiero 40|date=Sept 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
===Prehistoric and Pre-Columbian periods===
[[File:Two Xochipala figurines (Met by Ched) .jpg|thumb|left|Two figures from the Xochipala archeological site]]
The first humans in the stateâs territory were nomadic hunter-gatherers who left evidence of their existence in various caves starting about 20,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero  |title= Estado de Guerrero Historia|year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Guerrero History |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;riquezahis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=71 |title= La Riqueza HistÃ³rica de Guerrero |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=The Historical Richness of Guerrero |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until about 8,000 years ago, climatic conditions better favored human habitation than those today;&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; however, sedimentary human habitation happened around this time in the mountainous areas with more moisture, and better soil for agriculture. After that, settlements appeared near the coast because of fishing.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/medi.htm |title= Estado de Guerrero Medio Fisico |year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Guerrero Environment |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At these sites, evidence of weaving, ceramics, basketry and other crafts have been found. Around this time, a grain called teocintle, or the forerunner to corn, became the staple of the diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

There is debate as to whether the earliest civilizations here were [[Olmec]]s who migrated to this region or native peoples who were heavily influenced by the Olmecs, especially in the [[Balsas River|Mexcala River]] area. Olmec influences can be seen in cave paintings such as those found in [[Juxtlahuaca]] and well as stone tools and jade jewelry from the time period.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;riquezahis&quot;/&gt;

Eventually, the peoples of the Mexcala River area developed their own distinctive culture, called Mezcala or Mexcala. It is characterized by its own sculpture and ceramics, distinguished by its simplicity. Olmec influence remained with this culture, especially evident in the grouping of villages, construction of ceremonial centers and a government dominated by priests. Later, the culture assimilated aspects of the [[Teotihuacan]] model, which included the [[Mesoamerican ball game]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

Later migrations to the area brought ethnicities such as the [[PâurhÃ©pecha]], the Mixtecs, the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] and the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]]s who left traces on the local cultures as they established commercial centers around the 7th century. In the 8th century, [[Toltec]] influence was felt as they traveled the many trade routes through here in search of tropical bird plumage and [[amatl|amate paper]]. From the 12th century to the 15th, the various peoples of the state were influence by the [[Chichimeca]]s, culminating in [[Aztec empire|Aztec domination]] by the 15th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

In the 11th century, new migrations entered the area from the north, which included the Nahuas, who occupied what is now the center of the state and the PâurhÃ©pecha who took over the west. The Nahuas established themselves in [[La UniÃ³n de Isidoro Montes de Oca|Zacatula]], [[Atoyac de Ãlvarez|Atoyac]] and [[Tlacotepec]], later conquering the areas occupied by the [[Chontal]]s and [[Matlazinca]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;riquezahis&quot;/&gt;

By the 15th century, the territory of modern Guerrero state was inhabited by a number of peoples, none of whom had major cities or population centers. The most important of these peoples where the PâurhÃ©pecha, [[Cuitlateca]]s, [[Ocuiteca]]s and Matlazincas in the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]], the Chontales, [[Mazatleco]]s and [[Tlahuica]]s in the Sierra del Norte, the [[Coixca]]s and [[Tepozteco]]s in the Central Valleys, the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs in the La MontaÃ±a, the [[Jopi]]s, Mixtecos and Amuzgos in Costa Chica and [[Tolimeca]]s, [[Chubia]]s, [[Panteca]]s and [[Cuitleca]]s in [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande]]. Most of these lived in smaller dominions with moderate social stratification. One distinctive feature of the peoples of this was the use of cotton garments.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

The Aztecs began making incursions in the Guerrero area as early as 1414 under [[Chimalpopoca]] as part of the conquest of the [[Toluca Valley]]. Incursions into the Tierra Caliente came around 1433 under [[Itzcoatl]] who attacked the Cuitlatecos settled between the [[Teloloapan River|Teloloapan]] and [[Cocula River]]s. By 1440, the Aztec Empire controlled the north of the state, or the La MontaÃ±a area. Attempts to take the Costa Chica area began in 1452 against the Yopis, which failed. Various battles would be fought between 1452 and 1511 before most of the rest of the state became Aztec tributary provinces. The modern state of Guerrero the comprised seven Aztec provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

===Colonial period===
[[File:FacadePriscaTaxco.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Santa Prisca church in Taxco]]
During the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], the last Aztec emperor, [[CuauhtÃ©moc]] (who was the son of a Chontal princess and Ahuizotl), came from [[Ixcateopan]].  After the fall of [[Tenochtitlan]], there was little resistance by the peoples of the Guerrero area to the Spanish and a number of them, such as the Amuzgos, actively sided with the Europeans. In 1521, Rodrigo de CastaÃ±eda entered the Taxco area, while [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] marched on the Chontal region, the Sierra del Norte, the [[Iguala]] valley and later the Costa Chica. Juan Rodriguz de Villafuerte took the Costa Grande area.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

After the Spanish Conquest, the territory was part of the âaudenciaâ called âMexico,â which initially consisted of the lands of the former Aztec Empire, which was then diminished somewhat when it became a province of [[New Spain]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;riquezahis&quot;/&gt; The Guerrero area&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.2701 ''CÃ³dice Totomixtlahuaca'' or ''Codex Totomixtlahuaca''].  [[World Digital Library]]. [[Center for the Study of the History of Mexico CARSO]].  Retrieved November 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; was attractive to the Spanish mostly for its coast. The first Spanish Pacific port was at Zihuatanejo, used for trade, fishing and pearls. Another important area for the Spanish was Taxco for its minerals. The lands were divided into 76 [[encomienda]]s given to the [[conquistador]]s to exploit the mines, farmlands, forest and native peoples. Evangelization efforts were undertaken by the [[Augustinian]]s in the Central Valleys, La MontaÃ±a and Tierra Caliente regions while the [[Franciscans]] took the northern areas, the Costa Grande and Acapulco.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

Much of the population decline occurred in the first half of the 16th century when diseases brought by the Europeans, as well as brutal exploitation, killed many natives. This was particularly true in the Costa Chica region, which would lead to the importation of African slaves to the area. During this time indigenous political bodies called âpueblosâ or âIndian Republicsâ arose, which were local entities that represented the Indians of that area before Spanish authorities. They are credited with being one of the forerunners of the current municipality system in the state. At their height, there were 213 such pueblos in the Guerrero territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

During the colonial period, Acapulco became the main western port for New Spain, connecting this part of the Spanish empire to Asia. The [[Manila Galleon]] came here each year, bringing silks and other merchandise from China, India and other Asian areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;riquezahis&quot;/&gt;

By the second half of the 18th century, few indigenous people survived and exploitation of those that were left took on more varied forms in indentured servitude. Acapulco became the most important city in the area, and its mayor governed much of Guerreroâs territory.  This territory then belonged into three âintendenciasâ or âalcaldiasâ: Puebla, Mexico and [[Morelia|Valladolid]] and would remain so until the early Independence period.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

===Independence period===
[[File:Vicente Guerrero.jpg|thumb|[[Vicente Guerrero]]]]
Peoples of the territory of Guerrero immediately supported the cause of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] which would culminate with the Independence of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;riquezahis&quot;/&gt; During the first part of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], [[JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos]] fought on the side of Miguel Hidalgo in the southern part of Mexico, including the Acapulco area and the Costa Grande. However, the insurgents were never able to take the port. They were able to take control of territories in the center of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; Morelos took Chilpancingo and set up the [[Congress of AnÃ¡huac]], which would publish the document âSentimentos de la NaciÃ³nâ on 6 November 1813. The Congress of AnÃ¡huac also approved the Act of Independence written by [[Carlos MarÃ­a Bustamante]]. Later, the Mexican flag was designed and first sewn in [[Iguala]], after [[AgustÃ­n de Iturbide]] and Vicente Guerrero joined forces under the [[Plan of Iguala]] to end the war in 1821.&lt;ref name=&quot;riquezahis&quot;/&gt;

The first government of an independent Mexico divided the country into twelve departments. The territory of modern Guerrero state was divided among the departments of Mexico, Puebla, MichoacÃ¡n and [[Oaxaca]]. The [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]] made these entities states.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

In 1823, [[NicolÃ¡s Bravo]] and Vicente Guerrero petitioned for the creation of a âSouth Stateâ (Estado del Sur), encompassing the lands that Guerrero had military control over during the war, but without success. However, the federal government did recognize a military district centered on Chilpancingo which Guerrero headed until he became [[President of Mexico]] in 1824.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

Much of the country struggled between its liberal (federalist) and conservative (centralist) factions in the first half of the 19th century. In one of these battles, Vicente Guerrero was captured and executed in Oaxaca in 1831. With conservatives in charge, Nicolas Bravo proposed in 1836 a South Department with its capital in Chilpancingo, including the provinces of Acapulco, Chilapa, Tlapa and Taxco. In 1841, representatives from 42 communities in the area, called the âamigos del sur,â pushed to have a âAcapulco Departmentâ created, but it was rejected by [[Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

There were other political and military reorganizations in the area during the 1840s. In 1847, Nicolas Bravo and [[Juan Ãlvarez]] proposed creating a separate entity for the Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco areas, but the [[Mexican-American War]] intervened. After the war, the states of Puebla, Mexico and MichoacÃ¡n were persuaded to cede territory for a new entity and in 1849, President [[JosÃ© JoaquÃ­n de Herrera]] decreed the establishment of the state of Guerrero, with Juan Alvarez as its first governor. [[Tixtla]] was declared the first capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; The state was created from the districts of Acapulco, Chilapa and Taxco from the State of Mexico, Tlapa from Puebla and the municipality of Coyuca from the state of MichoacÃ¡n. The capital would later be moved to Chilpancingo in 1870.&lt;ref name=&quot;riquezahis&quot;/&gt;

In this state, Juan Alvarez rebelled against the government of [[Ignacio Comonfort]] and declared the [[Plan of Ayutla]] in 1854. However, this rebellion was quelled by the federal government. More uprisings would ensue after the adoption of the [[1857 Constitution]]. These uprisings were part of the ongoing struggle between liberals and conservatives in the country. Guerrero was a mostly conservative area of the country and it opposed both the 1857 Constitution and the [[Reform War|1859 Reform Laws]]. Intense battle between liberal and conservative elements would continue through most of the rest of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

For most of the [[Porfirio DÃ­az]] period, the state was in relative peace, electing nine governors, although only two of these were Guerrero natives. The economy became concentrated in the hands of a few landholders, military people and others. While the era was relatively prosperous, very little of this benefit reached the common people. Laws were passed and infrastructure in the state was created to benefit the major players of the economy. In addition, indigenous people were forced from the north to the south to work, such as the [[Kikapo]]s who were forced to work in the haciendas of the Costa Chica. Some of the first factories built in the state were constructed during this period. Acapulco was connected to Mexico City by rail in the 1890s. Despite the economic development, many people remained without work at the very end of the 19th century as mining and cotton farming waned.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

===Mexican Revolution to the present===
[[File:Zapatistas en el sitio El Jilguero.jpg|thumb|Zapatistas in El Jilguero]]
Some of the first uprisings against Diaz occurred in the state. In 1873 in the La MontaÃ±a region, Pascual Claudio pronounced the Plan de Xochihuahuetlan, with the backing of the Tlapanecos and Mixtecs of the state and pushed for the socialization of land. The revolt was put down one year later. In 1876, field workers in various regions rebelled against taxes, usurpation of lands and oppression against political prisoners. Another revolt occurred in 1887 in the Tlapa regions, led by Silverio Leon. In 1891, a movement led by JosÃ© Cuevas has a messianic character to it and worked to bring down the Diaz government.  In this case, federal control over much of Guerrero was weakened. In the 1900s, a number of intellectuals, including Eusebio S. Almonte (great grandson of Morelos) rebelled politically against the state and federal governments. The revolt was put down by Victoriano Huerta.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

A number of other rebellions broke out in the state against the Diaz government until the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910. From that point, many of the local rebels became affiliated with the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] .&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

In 1911, after DÃ­az resigned, the last of his supporting troops in Guerrero surrendered in Acapulco. Rebels loyal to [[Francisco I. Madero]] chose Francisco Figueroa as the governor and established Guerreroâs capital in Acapulco. While Madero was initially popular in Guerrero, he soon lost standing for failure to return lands which were claimed by various indigenous and rural farm groups. From this point, the Zapatistas turned on the Madero government with the next phase of the revolution breaking out in Guerrero and other states. The Zapatistas soon had control of the central valley and strategic positions in the north of the state. When [[Victoriano Huerta]] took control of the country, the Zapatistas in Guerrero joined forces with those loyal to [[Venustiano Carranza]], eventually controlling almost all of the state by 1914. During this time lands were redistributed. However, after Huerta resigned and Carranza assumed the presidency, the Zapatistas in Guerrero opposed him as well. Carranza offered the position of governor of Guerrero to Julian Blanco in 1915 but he was killed in an ambush a year later. From this point, there were battles between the Zapatistas and forces loyal to Carranza. This ended in 1919, when [[Emiliano Zapata]] died and his movement split.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

Various battles among the factions of the Mexican Revolution had skirmishes in the state until the war was finally over in 1920. The Zapatistas, although fragmented, were recognized as a political force in Guerrero with many Zapatistas receiving political and military positions. This included Rodolfo Neri as governor, who initiated the Agrarian Reform in 1921, organized workersâ unions and made education mandatory.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

Although the Revolution was over, there were still fractional struggles among unions, local strongmen, foreign interests and rural farm organizations over land, education and politics. These would flare up into localized armed rebellions such as the one led by Romulo Figueroa in 1923 and federal attempts to recuperate lands in 1927. In addition, battles related to the [[Cristero War]] were fought in Guerrero as well. There were a number of strikes and other political actions by unions in the 1930s. Government intervention brought better agricultural production techniques as well as new crops such as coconut groves, sesame seed and coffee. Some industries were introduced as well, especially in Iguala and Chilpancingo.  Most of these are related to food processing, mining and energy production.&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt;

Form the 1930s, to the present, the making of crafts and tourism have played a significant role in the economy. In Taxco, silver mining and silversmithing made a comeback due to the efforts of [[William Spratling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;enchistoria&quot;/&gt; Tourism is mostly centered on the coastal communities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and the tourist resort of Ixtapa. Acapulco became the first major tourist attraction for the state in the 1950s, when Hollywood stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Eddie Fisher]], [[Brigitte Bardot]] and others made it fashionable. During the 1960s and 1970s, new hotel resorts were built, and accommodation and transport were made cheaper. It was no longer necessary to be a millionaire to spend a holiday in Acapulco; the foreign and Mexican middle class could now afford to travel there.&lt;ref name=&quot;nileg&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nileguide.com/destination/acapulco/overview/history |title= History for Acapulco |publisher=Nilesâ Guides |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zihuatanejo, with the nearby resort area of Ixtapa, were developed by the federal government in the 1970s and 1980s to increase tourism to the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;encmuczihua&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal (2005)|title= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico ESTADO DE GUERRERO TENIENTE JOSÃ AZUETA |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/municipios/12038a.htm    |language=Spanish |trans_title=Encyclopedia of the Municipalities of Mexico State of Guerrero Teniento JosÃ© Azueta |accessdate=June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:MelvinbrownMex.jpg|thumb|Melvin Brown, Afro-Mexican football player]]
The state is home about 390,000 indigenous ethnic groups{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} , most of whom live in rugged, isolated mountain areas such as Ixcateopan, [[Santa MarÃ­a Oapan]], [[Ameyaltepec]], [[Chilapa de Ãlvarez]], [[Malinaltepec]], [[Tlapa de Comonfort]], [[Metlatonoc]], [[Zapotitlan Tablas]] and [[Xochistlahuaca]] and [[Xilitla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S8N4GVesp82.html |title= GuÃ­a de Viajeros Guerrero |author= Rosa Ma.

Only 29% of those who speak an indigenous language also speak Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;demogr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero |title= Estado de Guerrero Perfil SociodemoagrÃ¡fico|year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Guerrero Sociodemographic profile |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One distinctive group in the state is the Amuzgo people, who are concentrated in the south, near the Oaxacan border in municipalities such as Xochistlahuaca. This group is known for its handwoven textiles done on backstrap looms with many pieces recognized by the [[CONACULTA|Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes]]. [[Cualac, Guerrero|Cualac]] is noted for its machetes which have blades decorated by etching miniature landscapes. [[Temalacacingo]] and [[Acapetlahuaya]] produce gourd items, toys and small lacquered items. [[OlinalÃ¡]] has been an important producer of lacquer since pre-Hispanic times.&lt;ref name=&quot;raÃ­ces&quot;/&gt;

Another important group is the âafromexicanosâ or [[Afro-Mexican]]s who are concentrated in the Costa Chica region. This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated from the rest of Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day, there are many who have no birth certificates or know how to read or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been discriminated against and marginalized. Even among these people today, the concept of being ânegroâ is considered bad and a number take to skin-lightening methods. The musical style associated with the group is âchilena â which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, âSoy negro de la Costaâ¦,â has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexicoâs cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting Acapulco with [[Pinotepa Nacional]] and [[Puerto Escondido]], which opened it up to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people. The increase in people and contacts led to the building of schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;afromexicanos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/pics/art/articles/3906/file.afromexicanos.pdf |title= Los Afromexicanos: entre &quot;negros&quot; y &quot;mestizos&quot;  |author= Eduardo AÃ±orve Zapata |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Afro-Mexicans: between &quot;black&quot; and &quot;mestizo&quot; |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tradiciones&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=72 |title= Tradiciones y Costumbres |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Traditions and Customs |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The state does not have a tradition of painting and other visual arts aside from amate paper work but, recently, there has been a movement to promote more classical oils and other works, with recent generations of painters from the state and galleries opening to promote their work. Some of these artists include [[Casiano GarcÃ­a]], [[Ian Malaj]], [[Leonel Maciel]], [[Miguel Ãngel Sotelo]], [[GerzaÃ­n Vargas]] and [[Hugo ZÃºÃ±iga]].

The literary arts have a longer tradition, at least as far back as the 17th century. The best-known writer from the state hailed from [[Taxco]], playwright [[Juan Ruiz de AlarcÃ³n]]. He is considered to be one of the most notable writers from the Siglo de Oro of Spanish literature. Another notable writer from the state is [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], although he is better known for his role in the defeat of Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] and as a politician than as a writer. Other writers from the state over the centuries include [[Celedonio Serrano]], [[Herminio ChÃ¡vez]], [[Juan SÃ¡nchez Andraka]] and [[AndrÃ©s Acosta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1218&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jimenez Gonzalez |title=Sonora: GuÃ­a para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans_title=Guerrero: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2010 |publisher=Editorial OcÃ©ano de Mexico SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978 607 400 178 5 |pages=12â18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has a long history of folk music, which has been the basis of much of the state's modern compositions as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1218&quot;/&gt; Because of the different ethnicities, traditions and customs vary from region to region. In the coastal lowlands, music such as âsonâ is most often heard and dances such as [[jarabe]]s.  The culture of the Costa Chica region of Guerrero is centered on the municipality of Tixtla. Dances performed here include the Arranca Zacete, Jarabes, Palomo or Chilena and the Fandango. Most of these are accompanied by bands playing wind instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;tradiciones&quot;/&gt;  Another type of music which is endemic to the state is called &quot;calentana&quot;, which comes from an area called the Tierra Caliente. Tixtleca music comes from the town of Tixtla in the center of the state. Guerrero's best known composer is [[Margarito DamiÃ¡n Vargas]], who was active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was only 37 years old when he died, but he had written more than 200 musical works including &quot;Ondas del PacÃ­fico,&quot; &quot;Me delirio,&quot; &quot;AdiÃ³s a Acapulco,&quot; and &quot;Dolores,&quot; which have been performed by orchestras and popular singers. Other musicians include [[JosÃ© AgustÃ­n RamÃ­rez Altamirano]], [[ZacarÃ­as SalmerÃ³n Daza]] and [[Joan Sebastian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones1218&quot;/&gt;  As well, another singer from Guerrero, [[Aida Pierce]], became better known as an actress and comedienne.

Some interesting regional customs in Guerrero include the burning of âmaloâ (evil) on 29 September made with dried flowers. Afterward, protective crosses of fresh flowers are placed on doors of homes. Other customs are the singing of âPapaquisâ instead of â[[Las MaÃ±anitas]]â in Tixtla, the weddings of the Costa Grande where guests pay for their own food, the tiger fight dance in Zitlala and Tixtla and eating [[pozole]] on Thursdays in Chilpancingo.&lt;ref name=&quot;atractivos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guerrero/cult.htm |title= Estado de Guerrero Atractivos Culturales y TurÃ­sticos|year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Guerrero Cultural and tourist attractions |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuisine in the state is most strongly influenced by the indigenous, the Spanish and, to some extent, the French. Corn, chili pepper, beans and meat are indigenous ingredients. Indigenous preparations include the various moles (red, green, yellow and others), [[chalupa]]s, [[totopos]], [[atole]], [[pozole]] and many other dishes. Spanish contributions include wheat, leavened bread (including âchilpancingueÃ±as&quot;) and dairy products. French influence comes from the French occupation of the country in the 19th century as well as French monks who had been in the area of Chilapa earlier. Regional dishes include [[mole (sauce)|mole de jumil]] in Taxco, bean [[tamale]]s in [[Tepecoacuilco de Trujano|Tepecuacuilco]], quail dishes in Iguala and seafood âcuateteâ in the Costa Chica area. A number of areas in the state produce [[mezcal]] and wine is made in the [[Huitzuco]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;atractivos&quot;/&gt; Ozole blanco is widely and traditionally consumed on Thursdays and Saturdays in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;

The state's ethnic groups are known for their unique musical styles as well as regional dances. The best known dance is the Danza de los Tlacoloteros. This originated in the Central Valleys region, and its theme is agriculture. The owners of âtlacololesâ (cornfields) are called âtlacololoeros.â The basic premise is that these tlacololoeros chase away malevolent spirits from the crops, which are represented by [[nagual]]s or fierce tigers. The dance has 15 characters. It is most often performed in places such as [[Chichuihualco]], Taxco, Chilpancingo, Iguala and [[Atlixtac]]. Another dance that feature tigers is the Danza del Tecuano, where the animals stalk characters. This one is most often performed in [[Tuxpan, Guerrero|Tuxpan]], [[Ciudad Altamirano]] and Huitzuco. Other dances performed in the state include the Danza de los Diablos, the Danza de los Manueles, the Danza de los Gachupines, the Danza de los Siete Vicios, the Danza de los Pescados, the Danza de los Machos, the Danza de los Moros, the Danza de los Maizos, the Danza de los Zopilotes, the Danza de los Tejoneros and the Danza del Palomo de Guerrero.&lt;ref name=&quot;danzas&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=64 |title= danzas  |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Dances |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
===Triangle of the Sun===
[[File:Acapulco Nautico area in Acapulco, Mexico.jpg|thumb|Acapulco Bay]]
Almost all of Guerreroâs tourism is concentrated among the municipalities of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco, which the state promotes as the âTriÃ¡ngulo del Solâ (Triangle of the Sun). Acapulco is by far the most important of the three.&lt;ref name=&quot;atractivos&quot;/&gt; In 2008, the state attracted 272.8 million dollars of private investment into the tourism sector of the economy, with most of it invested in Acapulco and Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa. In addition, federal tourism agencies invested another 180 million pesos that year, both for infrastructure and promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;inversion&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title= Guerrero, Estado atractivo para la inversiÃ³n turÃ­stica |publisher= SecretarÃ­a de Turismo Estado de Guerrero |date=September 9, 2008 |url= http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/prensa/sectur/?contenido=38527 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guerrero, an attractive state for tourism investments |accessdate=June 24, }}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department of the United States has issued travel advisories for the state, especially Acapulco, due to drug trafficking, but safety concerns have been dismissed by local authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;pacifico&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Guerrero, &quot;un estado pacÃ­fico&quot;, responde AÃ±orve a alerta en EU |author=Ossieel Pacheco |url= http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2010/05/08/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=007n1soc |newspaper=La Jornada Guerrero |location=Chilpancingo |date=May 8, 2010 |accessdate=June 24, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guerrero, &quot;a tranquil state&quot; responde AÃ±orve to U.S. alert }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was declared a national monument by Mexico in 1990, with numerous historical buildings dating from the 17th to 19th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;

===Archeological sites===
[[File:Teopantecuanitlan monolith.svg|thumb|Drawing of a Teopantecuanitlan monolith]]
Most of Guerreroâs pre-Hispanic history is known through archeology. The state has 1,705 registered archeological sites, with seven officially open to the public. These include [[Xochipala|La Organera-Xochipala]], [[Palma Sola, Guerrero|Palma Sola]], [[TeopantecuanitlÃ¡n]] and [[CuetlajuchitlÃ¡n]].&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt; La Organera-Xochipala is the best known of Guerreroâs archeological sites because of its monumental architecture. The site has seven states of development with six patios, and thirty two structures. The site covers {{convert|1600|m2|abbr=on}} and is located in the community of Xochilapa in the municipality of Eduardo Neri or Zumpango del RÃ­o, which is a mountains and semi-arid region of the state. It was occupied from 650 CE to 1000 CE The tombs are the most notable constructions here and feature a number of Mayan âfalse arches.â .&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zonarq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=66 |title= Zonas Arqueologicas  |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Archeological zones |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palma Sola is a site on the south side of El Veladero in Acapulco. This site does not have any structure but rather it is important for 18 rocks with petrogylphs with images of humans, plants and animals. There are also figures which look to be calendar like and geographic in function.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;

Teopantecuanitlan is the most important Olmec era site in Guerrero. Its calculated to extend over {{convert|160|ha}} but the most important buildings cover {{convert|50000|m2|abbr=on}}. It was discovered in 1983 as it was being sacked. It is estimated to have been inhabited from between 1000 and 500 BCE. It is located in the Valley of Copalillo where the Amacuzas and Mezcala (Balsas) Rivers converge. Cuetlajuchitlan was discovered accidentally during the construction of the Cuernavaca, Acapulco highway. To preserve the site, the Los Querendes Tunnel was built underneath it.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt; It is calculated to extend {{convert|35|ha}} but only {{convert|2|ha}} have been explored. It was principally occupied between 200 BCE and 200 CE. It is identified as being with the Mezcala culture.  The site stands out as an early example of a planned city which extends from the intersection two main roads.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;

Other, smaller sites include Ixcateopan, [[Los Tepoltzis]] and [[Huamuxtitlan]]. Pueblo Viejo is located on the side of the El Tamarindo mountain just west of the city of Iguala. This site has an extension of {{convert|901145|m2|abbr=on}} and is divided in two parts due to a ravine that runs through it. The exact number of structures here is not known because the site has not been fully explored. The site of Ixcateopan is located in the municipality of the same name. The explored site was a civic-religious center with a palace and an altar to Quetzalcoatl.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt;  Los Tepoltzis is located outside the community of Tixtla and consists of a number of small sites including a ceremonial center thirty meters long, three meters high with stairways and a plaza. HuamuxtitlÃ¡n is in the municipality of the same name. While the site is covers significant territory only one pyramid has been uncovered. Most of the rest of the site consists of living quarters. Near this site are smaller sites along the Tlapaneco River.&lt;ref name=&quot;zonarq&quot;/&gt;

===Outdoor activities===
[[File:08Cacahuamilpa.JPG|thumb|Entering the Cacahuamilpa Caves]]
The state has a number of sites suitable for ecotourism, including mountains, caves, wild areas for the observation of flora and fauna, camping and areas that offer extreme sports. Many of the extreme sports are offered in the Acapulco area including high-speed water jets, [[kayak]]ing, canoeing, river rafting, rock climbing, [[spelunking]], [[paintball]], mountain climbing, [[parasailing]] and more. Activities in other parts of the state include rafting on the Papagayo River, kayaking and canoeing in Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, rock-climbing in Chilpancingo and Taxco, mountain climbing in Ixcateopan, [[rappelling]] in Zihuatanejo and [[bungee jumping]] and parasailing in Iguala.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecoturismo&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=18  |title=Ecoturismo |publisher= State of  Guerrero |location=Guerrero |language=Spanish |trans_title=Ecotourism |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a number of caves to explore such as Grutas Dos Arroyos in Dos Arroyos, various small caves in Pueblo Bravo and some in Acapulco.&lt;ref name=&quot;ecoturismo&quot;/&gt;  The best known caves in the state are in the [[Grutas de Cacahuamilpa National Park]]. This park is home to the Grutas de Cacahuamilpa Caverns and Grutas de Carlos Pacheco. The first is a live cave with many rock formations still in progress. This has infrastructure for tourists and guided tours. The second set of caves is a dry cave with less infrastructure. .&lt;ref name=&quot;mexdesguerrero&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quintanar Hinajosa |first=Beatriz |year=2009 |title= Rutas Turisticas: Guerrero: El destino del mundo |journal=Mexico Desconocido |volume=135 |pages=94â95 |publisher= Grupo Editorial Impresiones AÃ©reas |location=Mexico City |issn=188 5146   |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handcrafts==
[[File:BrowseRealMina.JPG|thumb|Browsing at a silver shop in Taxco]]
Crafts form an important part of the stateâs economy, providing all or part of many familiesâ income. The state government passed the Ley de Fomento a la Cultural in 1988 which works to protect crafts produced within the state. One type of handcraft produced in the state is metalworking with most precious and non-precious metals. The best known work produced in the state is made with silver, centered in the town of Taxco. Each year this town holds the annual National Silver Fair (Feria Nacional de la Plata). Gold is worked in locations such as Iguala, Ciudad Altamirano, Coyuca de CatalÃ¡n, Arcelia and Ometepec. Steel machetes and other items are produced in Ayutla, Tixtla, Chilapa, Tecpan deGaleana and Ometepec. Gold leaf is done in Tlacotepec, Tlalchipa and Cuetzala del Progreso. Costume jewelry is made in AcatlÃ¡n, and Chilapa, producing buttons of various colors, pieces made of brass coated in nickel, glass and metal wire to produce items such as necklaces, bracelets, and more. Other jewelry is made by twisting and weaving fine strands of silver or gold wire. Silver is mostly done in Taxco, with gold pieces in Ciudad Altamirano.&lt;ref name=&quot;artesanias&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=69 |title= ArtesanÃ­as |publisher= Government of Guerrero |location=Guerrero, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Handcrafts |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones3639&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jimenez Gonzalez |title=Guerrero: GuÃ­a para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans_title=Guerrero: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2010 |publisher=Editorial OcÃ©ano de Mexico SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978 607 400 178 5 |pages=36â39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laca is the making of wooden items which are then painted and coated with a high-gloss lacquer. The best pieces of this type are made of a wood called linalÃ³e ([[Bursera aloexylon]]) which is aromatic. Cheaper ones are made of pine, treated to smell like linalÃ³e. The making of lacquered items is centered in the municipality of OlinalÃ¡, but also can be found in Temalcalcingo, [[Ocotepec, Guerrero|Ocotepec]] and [[Acapetlahuaya]]. OlinalÃ¡âs lacquered items are traditional made with a wood called linaloe, with has a distinctive odor, but due to its relatively scarcity, pine is also being used. Items made include small boxes, chests, trays, masks, frames, jewelry boxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;artesanias&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones3639&quot;/&gt;

Pottery is a very traditional craft and is practices in many of the communities of the state, although most of the wares produced are basic and meant for local consumption. These items include cooking pots, water containers, pitchers, candle holders and some sculptured decorative items. Most of these items have been made the same way since the pre-Hispanic period. The best quality ware is considered to be made in the central valleys in municipalities such as [[Zacualpan, Guerrero|Zacualpan]], [[Nuitzalapa]], [[Atzacualoya]], and others. Some areas have become specialized for certain types of pieces. The San Juan neighborhood of Chilapa make figures of a cerarmic which is glassy after firing. AcatlÃ¡n mades ceramic toys, and Ometepec specializes in the making of very large [[cÃ¡ntaro]] jars, traditionally used for storage.&lt;ref name=&quot;artesanias&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones3639&quot;/&gt;

Clothing and textiles are mostly made by indigenous communities such as the Nahuas, Mixtecos and Amuzgos, who use weaving and embroidery patterns to distinguish themselves from one another. The most distinctive indigenous clothing item is the huipil although rebozos and other items are also made.. While much is made for local consumption, indigenous clothing can be found in tourist areas and other markets as well as tablecloths, napkins and other decorative pieces. Communities with reputation for their textiles include Tlacoachistlahuaca, Xochistlahuaca, YoloxÃ³chilt ([[San Luis AcatlÃ¡n]]) and AcatlÃ¡n (Chilapa) .&lt;ref name=&quot;artesanias&quot;/&gt;

Another craft, practiced mostly along the central and coastal areas, is that of palm frond weaving. With these fronds items like hats, bags, fans, mats, animal figures and more are made. A particular type of hat made in this fashion in Chilapa, Zitlala, ZapotitlÃ¡n Tablas and Ahuacoutzingo is called a âcosteÃ±oâ hat.&lt;ref name=&quot;artesanias&quot;/&gt;

Most handcrafted furniture is made in Taxco and Ixcatepoan, in which an aromatic cedar is found. Other furniture producing areas are Chilpancingo, Iguala, Teloloapan and Ciudad Altamirano. In addition to furniture, items such as masks and figures are carved from wood.&lt;ref name=&quot;artesanias&quot;/&gt;

One craft which is specific to the state is painting using traditional amate or bark paper as a canvas. This craft began in the 1970s in Xalitla, located between Iguala and Chilpancingo. Since that time, these paintings or drawings have become known both inside and outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name=&quot;artesanias&quot;/&gt;  The best known works today come from the communities of Maxela, San Juan, AhuelicÃ¡n and Ahuehuepan. Most of the themes of these paintings are related to agriculture, everyday life and religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;raÃ­ces&quot;/&gt;

Leathercrafts is mostly limited to saddlemaking and other items relating to horseback riding. This is prominent in areas such as San JerÃ³nimo, Chilpancingo, Tixtla, [[Quechultenango]] and others. Other crafts include stone sculpting and the cutting of precious and semiprecious stones, buttons and other items for clothing and costume jewelry.&lt;ref name=&quot;artesanias&quot;/&gt;

==Politics==
The state is divided into 81 [[municipalities of Guerrero|municipalities]] and seven political regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;arqueomex&quot;/&gt; The largest municipality is [[Coahuayutla]] at 3,511.5km2 and the most recently created one is [[Iliatenco]] in the La MontaÃ±a region.&lt;ref name=&quot;gobierno&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero  |title= Estado de Guerrero Gobierno|year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Guerrero Government |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three best-known communities of the state are Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Taxco.&lt;ref name=&quot;raÃ­ces&quot;/&gt; The current Governor of state is Angel Aguirre Rivero.

==Geography, climate and nature==
[[File:Mezcala (or Balsas) River in Guerrero, Mexico.jpg|thumb|Mezcala or Balsas River in Guerrero]]
The state of Guerrero has a territory of {{convert|63794|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The state borders the states of Mexico, [[Morelos]], Puebla, Michoacan, Oaxaca and with the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west.  Geographically, the state is divided into three regions: La MontaÃ±a (mountains), [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] (hot lands) of the northeast and La Costa (coast) .&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt; La MontaÃ±a is mostly forested and is concentrated in the north and east of the state. Tierra Caliente and is situated in the lowlands along the Balsas River. This area also extends into MichoacÃ¡n state and is called similarly. La Costa is divided into two subregions called Costa Chica and Costa Grande. The Costa Chica extends from Acapulco to the border with Oaxaca. Costa Grande extends west of Acapulco to the Balsas River. Much of the stateâs current agriculture and livestock raising concentrated in La Costa as it is relatively flat.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Most of the state is covered in mountains of varying heights, with deep canyons with flat areas limited to small mesas and the coastline. Most of the mountains belong to the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]]. The exception is the mountains of the Taxco area which belong to the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] and include the small mountain ranges of the Sierra de Sultepec, Sierra de Zacualpan and the Sierra de Zultepec. These are connected to the same volcanic system as the [[Nevado de Toluca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The stateâs climate is dominated by the rainy tropical areas and rainy temperate areas. The former has high temperatures above {{convert|18|C|F|1}} year round and experiences most rain in the summer and early fall.  Most of this is found near the coast under {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|asl]]. In the higher elevations away from the coast in the Sierra Madre del Sur, the climate is temperate but also experiences the same pattern of rainfall. Most of the rain that falls in the state is produced from evaporation from the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The coast extends for about {{convert|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} and includes features such as the Balsas River delta, Mongles Point, Ixtapa Point, Zihuatanejo Bay, [[Isla Ixtapa|Ixtapa Island]], Acapulco Bay, Apies Island, Islas Blancas, San Gabriel Island, Islas Frailes Blancos or Rocas de Potosi, Punta Gorda, and others. There are a number of lagoons along the coast including the Laguna de Potosi in Morro de PetatlÃ¡n, Lagunas de Mitla, the Laguna de Nusco and the Laguna de Coyuca.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;
[[File:La Roqueta Island in Acapulco, Mexico.jpg|thumb|left|La Roqueta Island off of Acapulco]]
The Balsas River enters Guerrero from Puebla state where it is formed. Prior to reaching the town of Balsas, the river is called Mexcala, then Balsas to the ocean. The Nexapa River is a tributary of the upper portion of the Balsas. The Amacuzac River enters the state from the State of Mexico. It passes under the Grutas de Cacahuamilco, then reemerges to form part of the border between Guerrero and Morelos. The Tepecoacuilco or Huitzuco River forms within the state and is a tributary of the Balsas.  The Cocula or Iguala River forms in the Taxco area and is one of the major drainages of this region. Other rivers in the state include the Cuetzala, the Alohuixtla, the Cutzamala, the Tlapaneco Huamuxtitlan, the Milpilla or Zumpango, the RÃ­o del Oro, the Zayulapa, the Huautla and the RÃ­o UniÃ³n.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Flora of the state is determined by altitude and climate. The higher mountain areas have forests of pine and [[oyamel]] fir, with amate, and other tropical trees found in the lower elevations. Tropical hardwoods are mostly found in the lower elevations near the coast. The state has a wide variety of wildlife from deer, small mammals, large numbers of birds and reptiles and insects.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Five terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s extend across the state. The [[Southern Pacific dry forests]] lie on the southern slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur, extending from the coast up to 1400 meters elevation. The forests are predominantly [[deciduous]] during the long dry season. The [[Sierra Madre del Sur pine-oak forests]] occupy the higher slopes of the Sierra Madre del Sur. These forests harbor a great diversity of species, including many endemic [[orchid]]s, butterflies, and birds. The [[Balsas dry forests]] lie in the basin of the Balsas River, north of the Sierra Madre del Sur, and are notable for the diversity of mammal species, including [[jaguarundi]], [[coati]], [[ocelot]], and [[collared peccary]]. The northernmost part of the state includes portions of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests]], which occupy the mountainous northern rim of the Balsas basin. The [[Mexican South Pacific mangroves]] are found in coastal lagoons along the coast of [[Michoacan]], Guerrero, and [[Oaxaca]].

The Parque Natural de Guerrero is a natural reserve located in the central valleys of the state, extending for about eighty kilometers squared. Most of the area is covered in pine and holm oak forests that covered the high altitude valleys of this region.&lt;ref name=&quot;rincones76&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Victor Manuel |editor1-last=Jimenez Gonzalez |title=Sonora: GuÃ­a para descubrir los encantos del estado |trans_title=Guerrero: Guide to discover the charms of the state |year=2010 |publisher=Editorial OcÃ©ano de Mexico SA de CV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |isbn=978 607 400 178 5 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Agricultural production is mostly of basic staple crops such as corn, rice and beans along with tomatoes, [[tomatillo]]s, [[okra]], green chili peppers, chickpeas, soybeans, yams, and other vegetables. Commercial crops include coffee, [[hibiscus]], sugar cane, sesame seed, peanuts and [[sorghum]]. A number of fruits are grown for both domestic consumption and market such as melons, [[papaya]], watermelon, [[mango]]s, bananas, [[tamarind]] and citrus.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero  |title= Estado de Guerrero Actividad EconÃ³nica|year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Guerrero Economic Activity |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state has large forests with logging potential, although most are [[ejido]] or other community property. Most of the loggable timber is pine.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Fishing is an important industry for the state with livestock raised is limited due to poor pastures due to overgrazing. They include cattle, pigs, goats and sheep as well as some domestic fowl.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;/&gt;  The long coast is important for fishing which support 55 fishing communities. The main fishing ports are [[La UniÃ³n de Isidoro Montes de Oca|Petacalco]], Zihuatanejo, Acapulco, Barra de Tecoanapa and Puna Maldonado. Commercial fishing brings in shark, sailfish, sierra, sea bass, [[mojarra]], lobster, shrimp, clams and many other species.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

The mountains in the interior of the state have mineral deposits, such as gold and lead as well as iron. The latter is found mostly along the Balsas River.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediofisico&quot;/&gt;

Tourism is the most important sector of the stateâs commerce. Tourism in Guerrero is important to the overall Mexican economy as well. It is the main source of the stateâs economic development.&lt;ref name=&quot;economia&quot;/&gt;

The main employment generators of the state are service industry (28.2% of workers), commerce, restaurants and hotels (25.1%), financial services and real estate (13.4) and manufacturing (12.2%).&lt;ref name=&quot;actividades&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.gob.mx/monografias/informacion/gro/economia/default.aspx?tema=me&amp;e=12|title= Actividades econÃ³micas  (Guerrero) |publisher=INEGI |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Economic Activities (Guerrero) |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to the lack of employment and the general lack of education of many in Guerrero, the state ranks number one in the number of migrants that head to the United States to work. It is estimated that each year 73,000 head north to live permanently with another 128,000 who migrate each year during the dry season. It is also estimated what somewhere between one quarter and one third of Guerreroâs population lives in the United States, with about 300,000 in the Chicago area alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;datos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sipaz.org/data/gro_es_03.htm|title= Guerrero in datos |publisher= Servicio Internacional para La Paz |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Guerrero in data |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon has left many villages with no men and women taking up most of the work such as farming, crafts and petty commerce.&lt;ref name=&quot;mujeres&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.guerrero.gob.mx/?P=readart&amp;ArtOrder=ReadArt&amp;Article=3891|title= Mujeres indÃ­genas migrantes de la MontaÃ±a de Guerrero, una aproximaciÃ³n.|author=SEDESOL |publisher= State of Guerrero|location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=Indigenous migrant women of the La MontaÃ±a area of Guerrero, an approximation |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Until the 1970s, illiteracy was a major problem in Guerrero. However, the rate of illiteracy was down from 48% to 26.8% from 1970 to 1990.  Illiteracy still remains a problem with a 21.55% rate. The lowest levels are in Acapulco and Iguala with the highest in rural municipalities such as Metlatonoc (80.6%) and Tlacoachistlahuaca (73.3%). However, the literacy rate for those between 6 and 14 year of age is 80%.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraestructura&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.e-local.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guerrero  |title= Estado de Guerrero Infraestructura Social y de Comunicaciones|year=2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de MÃ©xico |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans_title=State of Guerrero Social infrastructure and communications |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From pre-school through high school, the state has 9,559 schools, staffed by 44,239 teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraestructura&quot;/&gt; The state university is the [[Universidad AutÃ³noma de Guerrero]], which was initially founded as the Instituto Literario de Ãlvarez in 1852 in Acapulco. It was transferred to Chilpancingo when that city was made the capital in 1870. The institution was reorganized a number of times with the most modern structure taking shape in 1960, when the institution was named the Universidad de Guerrero. The current name was granted in 1963 when it became autonomous from direct state control.&lt;ref name=&quot;uag&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uagro.mx/template/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=14|title=Histora  |publisher= Universidad AutÃ³noma de Guerrero |location=Chilpancingo |language=Spanish |trans_title=History |accessdate=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also education in the native [[Amuzgo Guerrero language]].

==Infrastructure==
Guerrero has a number of radio stations, one television channel, which broadcasts from the capital, with the rest satellite TV. There are international airports in [[General Juan N. Ãlvarez International Airport|Acapulco]] and [[Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo International Airport|Zihuatanejo]] as well as private airstrips.&lt;ref name=&quot;infraestructura&quot;/&gt;
