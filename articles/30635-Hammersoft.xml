The '''Taliban''', alternative spelling '''Taleban''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/144382.stm | title=Analysis: Who are the Taleban? | date=December 20, 2000 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''{{transl|ps|[[Talib|á¹­ÄlibÄn]]}}'', meaning &quot;students&quot; in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is an [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant and political group that ruled large parts of [[Afghanistan]] and its capital, [[Kabul]], as the  [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]] from September 1996. It gained [[diplomatic recognition]] from only three states: [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

After the [[attacks of September 11]], 2001 the Taliban was overthrown by [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]]. Later it regrouped as an [[insurgency]] movement to fight the  [[Afghanistan|Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] (established in late 2001) and the [[NATO]]-led [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF).&lt;ref&gt;ISAF has participating forces from 39 countries, including all 26 NATO members.

Most Taliban leaders were influenced by [[Deobandi]] fundamentalism. Many also strictly follow the social and cultural norm called [[Pashtunwali]]. The Taliban movement is primarily made up of members belonging to [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] [[Pashtun tribes|tribes]], the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shavemagazine.com/politics/090501/2 |title= Pakistan and the Taliban: It's Complicated| publisher=[http://www.shavemagazine.com/ Shave Magazine]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main leader of the Taliban movement is Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2325?_hi=34&amp;_pos=4 |title=From the article on the Taliban in Oxford Islamic Studies Online |publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies |date= | accessdate= August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omar's original commanders were &quot;a mixture of former small-unit military commanders and [[madrassa]] teachers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Goodson|2001 | p = 114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in power, the Taliban enforced one of the strictest interpretations of Sharia law ever seen in the [[Muslim world]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb |Rashid|2000|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however most of their criticism came from leading Muslim scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/islam-and-the-world/politics-and-economics/166241-taliban-and-al-qaeda-true-sects-of-islam.html Taliban and Al-Qaeda: True Sects of Islam? - Politics &amp; Economics - counsels - OnIslam.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They became notorious internationally for their [[Taliban treatment of women|treatment of women]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maley&quot;&gt;Dupree Hatch, Nancy. &quot;Afghan Women under the Taliban&quot; in Maley, William.

According to a report by the [[United Nations]], the Taliban were responsible for 2,477 civilian casualties (76 percent of all casualties) in the first six months of 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/taliban-responsible-76-deaths-afghanistan-un| work= The Weekly Standard| accessdate= | title= UN: Taliban Responsible for 76% of Deaths in Afghanistan | first=| last=| date = 2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Taliban'' is Pashto, {{lang|ps|Ø·Ø§ÙØ¨Ø§Ù}} ''{{transl|ps|á¹­ÄlibÄn}}'', meaning &quot;students&quot;, the plural of ''á¹­Älib''. This is a [[loanword]] from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|Ø·Ø§ÙØ¨}} ''{{transl|ar|á¹­Älib}}'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Arabic Dictionary&quot;&gt;[http://online.ectaco.co.uk/main.jsp?do=e-services-dictionaries-word_translate1&amp;status=translate&amp;lang1=23&amp;lang2=ar&amp;source_id=2248807 English &lt;-&gt; Arabic Online Dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt; plus the Indo-Iranian plural ending -an  {{lang|ps|Ø§Ù}} (the Arabic plural being {{lang|ar|Ø·ÙØ§Ø¨}} ''{{transl|ar|á¹­ullÄb}}'', whereas {{lang|ar|Ø·Ø§ÙØ¨Ø§Ù}} ''{{transl|ar|á¹­ÄlibÄn}}'' is a dual form with the incongruous meaning, to Arabic speakers, of &quot;two students&quot;). Since becoming a loanword in English, ''Taliban'', besides a plural noun referring to the group, has also been used as a singular noun referring to an individual. For example, [[John Walker Lindh]] has been referred to as &quot;an American Taliban&quot;, rather than &quot;an American Talib&quot;.  In the English language newspapers of Pakistan the word talibans is often used when referring to more than one taliban. The spelling 'Taliban' has come to predominate over 'Taleban' in English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/06/from_taleban_to_taliban.html From 'Taleban' to 'Taliban'] BBC&amp;nbsp;â The Editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Emergence===
{{Main|Taliban's rise to power}}
After the fall of the [[communist]] [[Mohammad Najibullah]]-regime in 1992, several Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The Peshawar Accords created the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] and appointed an [[interim government]] for a transitional period. According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:

{{quote |The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]], an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the [[Soviet]]-backed Najibullah government. [...] With the exception of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami]], all of the parties... were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992. [...] Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and [[Kabul]] generally. [...] Shells and rockets fell everywhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;}}

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar received operational, financial and military support from [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Neamatollah Nojumi&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Neamatollah Nojumi | authorlink = | title =The Rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan: Mass Mobilization, Civil War, and the Future of the Region|edition=2002 1st |pages=| publisher = Palgrave, New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan expert [[Amin Saikal]] concludes in ''Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival'':

{{quote |Pakistan was keen to gear up for a breakthrough in [[Central Asia]]. [...] [[Islamabad]] could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders... to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions. [...] Had it not been for the ISI's logistic support and supply of a large number of rockets, Hekmatyar's forces would not have been able to target and destroy half of Kabul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt;}}

In addition, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]] â as competitors for regional [[hegemony]] â supported Afghan militias hostile towards each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last =Amin Saikal | authorlink = Amin Saikal| title =Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival| year =2006 | edition = 1st | page= 352| publisher = I.B. Tauris &amp; Co | location = London New York | isbn = 1-85043-437-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Human Rights Watch, Iran assisted the [[Shia]] [[Hazara people|Hazara]] [[Hezb-i Wahdat]] forces of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]], as Iran attempted to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence.&lt;ref name = &quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date= | url =http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands | title = Blood-Stained Hands, Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;&gt;Gutman, Roy (2008): How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan, Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 1st ed., Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saudi Arabia supported the [[Wahhabite]] [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]] and his [[Ittihad-i Islami]] faction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Amin Saikal&quot; /&gt;  Conflict between the two militias soon escalated into a full-scale war.  A publication by the [[George Washington University]] describes:

{{quote |[O]utside forces saw instability in Afghanistan as an opportunity to press their own security and political agendas.&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Security Archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url =http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/ | title =The September 11 Sourcebooks Volume VII: The Taliban File| publisher = [[George Washington University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Due to the sudden initiation of the war, working government departments, police units or a system of justice and accountability for the newly-created Islamic State of Afghanistan did not have time to form. Horrific crimes were committed by individuals of different factions. Rare ceasefires, usually negotiated by representatives of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] or [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] (the interim government), or officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), commonly collapsed within days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile southern Afghanistan was neither under the control of foreign-backed militias nor the government in Kabul, but was ruled by local leaders such as [[Gul Agha Sherzai]] and their militias. In 1991, the Taliban (a movement originating from [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]]-run religious schools for Afghan refugees in Pakistan) also developed in Afghanistan as a politico-religious force, reportedly in opposition to the [[tyranny]] of the local governor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;&gt;Matinuddin, Kamal, ''The Taliban Phenomenon, Afghanistan 1994â1997'', [[Oxford University Press]], (1999), pp. 25â6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] started his movement with fewer than 50 armed [[madrassah]] students in his hometown of [[Kandahar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;/&gt; The most credible and often-repeated story of how Mullah Omar first mobilized his followers is that in the spring of 1994, neighbors in [[Singesar]] told him that the local governor had abducted two teenage girls, shaved their heads, and taken them to a camp where they were raped repeatedly. 30 Taliban (with only 16 rifles) freed the girls, and hanged the governor from the barrel of a tank. Later that year, two militia commanders killed civilians while fighting for the right to [[sodomize]] a young boy. The Taliban freed him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matinuddin, Kamal 1999 pp.25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban's first major military activity was in 1994, when they marched northward from [[Maywand District|Maiwand]] and captured [[Kandahar| Kandahar City]] and the surrounding provinces, losing only a few dozen men.&lt;ref name = &quot;Rashid 2000 27â29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=27â29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When they took control of Kandahar in 1994, they forced the surrender of dozens of local Pashtun leaders who had presided over a situation of complete lawlessness and atrocities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashid 2000 27â29&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (5)&quot;/&gt; The Taliban also took-over a border crossing at Spin Baldak and an ammunition dump from [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. In the course of 1994, the Taliban took control of 12 of 34 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provinces]] not under central government control, disarming the &quot;heavily armed population&quot;. Militias controlling the different areas often surrendered without a fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=29&quot;/&gt;

At the same time most of the militia factions (Hekmatyar's Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]]. Bombardment of the capital came to a halt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghanistan Justice Project&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2005|url=http://www.afghanistanjusticeproject.org/warcrimesandcrimesagainsthumanity19782001.pdf |title =Casting Shadows: War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity: 1978â2001 | publisher = Afghanistan Justice Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;&gt;Amnesty International. &quot;Document - Afghanistan: further information on fear for safety and new concern: deliberate and arbitrary killings: civilians in Kabul.&quot; 16 November 1995 Accessed at [http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA11/015/1995/en/6d874caa-eb2a-11dd-92ac-295bdf97101f/asa110151995en.html Amnesty.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;International Committee of the Red Cross&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1995|url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jly2.htm |title =Afghanistan: escalation of indiscriminate shelling in Kabul| publisher =International Committee of the Red Cross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide [[political process]] with the goal of national [[Democratic consolidation|consolidation]] and [[democratic]] elections, also inviting the Taliban to join the process and to contribute to stability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] had been named &quot;The Afghan who won the cold war&quot; by ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Rose&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001 |url =http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2911290068493351924# |title = [[Charlie Rose]], March 26, 2001| publisher = [[CBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had defeated the [[Soviet Red Army]] nine times in his home region of [[Panjshir Province|Panjshir]], in north-eastern Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url =http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/27/massoud.afghanistan/ |title = He would have found Bin Laden| publisher = CNN | date=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud, unarmed, went to talk to some Taliban leaders in [[Maidan Shar]] to convince them to join the initiated political process, so that democratic elections could be held to decide on a future government for Afghanistan. He hoped for them to be allies in bringing stability to Afghanistan. But the Taliban declined to join such a political process. When Massoud returned unharmed to Kabul, the Taliban leader who had received him as his guest paid with his life (he was killed by other senior Taliban) for failing to execute Massoud while the possibility had presented itself.

The Taliban started shelling Kabul in early 1995 but were defeated by forces of the Islamic State government under [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amnesty.org&quot;/&gt; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzPcMB9SQz0&amp;feature=search ''see'' video] [[Amnesty International]], referring to the Taliban offensive, wrote in a 1995 report:

====Creation of the United Front====
The Taliban imposed on the parts of Afghanistan under their control their interpretation of [[Islam]]. The [[Physicians for Human Rights]] (PHR) analyze:
:&quot;To PHR's knowledge, no other regime in the world has methodically and violently forced half of its population into virtual [[house arrest]], prohibiting them on pain of physical punishment&quot;.&lt;ref name = physicians&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/documents/reports/talibans-war-on-women.pdf &quot;The Taliban's War on Women&quot;]}}, Physicians for Human Rights, August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
Women were required to wear the all-covering ''[[burqa]]'', they were banned from public life and denied access to health care and education, windows needed to be covered so that women could not be seen from the outside, and they were not allowed to laugh in a manner they could be heard by others.&lt;ref name=physicians /&gt; The Taliban, without any real court or hearing, cut people's hands or arms off when they were accused of stealing.&lt;ref name=physicians /&gt; Taliban hit-squads watched the streets, conducting brutal public beatings.&lt;ref name=physicians /&gt;

[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] and [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], two former archnemeses, created the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Front]] (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban that were preparing offensives against the remaining areas under the control of Massoud and those under the control of Dostum. [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvYglyjbHkI see video] The United Front included beside the dominantly [[Tajik people|Tajik]] forces of Massoud and the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] forces of Dostum, [[Hazara people|Hazara]] factions and [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] forces under the leadership of commanders such as [[Abdul Haq (Afghan leader)|Abdul Haq]], [[Haji Abdul Qadir]], Qari Baba or diplomat [[Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai]]. From the Taliban conquest in 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]], [[Kapisa Province|Kapisa]], [[Takhar Province|Takhar]] and parts of [[Parwan Province|Parwan]], [[Kunar Province|Kunar]], [[Nuristan Province|Nuristan]], [[Laghman Province|Laghman]], [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]], [[GhÅr Province|GhÅr]] and [[Bamyan Province|Bamyan]].

====Taliban massacres====

====Pakistani military interference====

Pakistani President [[Pervez Musharraf]] â then as Chief of Army Staff â was responsible for sending thousands of Pakistanis to fight alongside the Taliban and Bin Laden against the forces of Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;George Washington University&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;National Geographic&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 |url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpQI6HKV-ZY&amp;feature=related |title = Inside the Taliban| publisher = [[National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History Commons&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2010 |url =http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=ahmed_shah_massoud |title = History Commons| publisher = [[History Commons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total there were believed to be 28,000 Pakistani nationals fighting inside Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; 20,000 were regular Pakistani soldiers either from the [[Frontier Corps]] or army and an estimated 8,000 were militants recruited in [[madrassa]]s filling regular Taliban ranks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot; /&gt; The estimated 25,000 Taliban regular force thus comprised more than 8,000 Pakistani nationals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashid 2000 91&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1998 document by the [[U.S. State Department]] confirms that &quot;20â40 percent of [regular] Taliban soldiers are Pakistani.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;George Washington University&quot;/&gt; The document further states that the parents of those Pakistani nationals &quot;know nothing regarding their child's military involvement with the Taliban until their bodies are brought back to Pakistan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;George Washington University&quot;/&gt; Further 3,000 fighters of the regular Taliban army were Arab and Central Asian militants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot; /&gt; From 1996 to 2001 the [[Al Qaeda]] of [[Osama Bin Laden]] and [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] became a state within the Taliban state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2008|url =http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008\08\31\story_31-8-2008_pg3_4 |title = Book review: The inside track on Afghan wars by Khaled Ahmed| publisher = [[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden sent Arab recruits to join the fight against the United Front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily Times&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|date=unknown|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grugy2txSvc&amp;feature=search |title = Brigade 055| publisher = CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of roughly 45,000 Pakistani, Taliban and Al Qaeda soldiers fighting against the forces of Massoud only 14,000 were Afghan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;

====Ahmad Shah Massoud====
[[File:1996afghan (1).png|thumb|240px|Map of Afghanistan in late 1996; Massoud (red), Dostum (green), and Taliban (yellow)]]
[[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] was the only major anti-Taliban leader who never left Afghanistan for exile and who was able to defend vast parts of his territory against the Taliban. [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] and his forces were defeated by the Taliban in 1998. Dostum subsequently went into exile.

In the areas under his control Massoud set up democratic institutions and signed the [[Women's Rights]] Declaration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite book| last = Marcela Grad| authorlink = Marcela Grad| title = Massoud: An Intimate Portrait of the Legendary Afghan Leader|edition=March 1, 2009 |page=310  | publisher =  Webster University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the area of Massoud, women and girls did not have to wear the Afghan burqa. They were allowed to work and to go to school. In at least two known instances, Massoud personally intervened against cases of forced marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; To Massoud there was reportedly nothing worse than treating a person like an object.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; He stated:
:&quot;It is our conviction and we believe that both men and women are created by the Almighty. Both have equal rights. Women can pursue an education, women can pursue a career, and women can play a role in society â just like men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;
Author Pepe Escobar wrote in ''Massoud: From Warrior to Statesman'':
:&quot;Massoud is adamant that in Afghanistan women have suffered oppression for generations. He says that 'the cultural environment of the country suffocates women. But the Taliban exacerbate this with oppression.' His most ambitious project is to shatter this cultural prejudice and so give more space, freedom and equality to women â they would have the same rights as men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;
While it was Massoud's stated conviction that men and women are equal and should enjoy the same rights, he also had to deal with Afghan traditions which he said would need a generation or more to overcome. In his opinion that could only be achieved through education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; Humayun Tandar, who took part as a Afghan diplomat in the 2001 [[International Conference on Afghanistan]] in Bonn, said that &quot;strictures of language, ethnicity, region were [also] stifling for Massoud. That is why ... he wanted to create a unity which could surpass the situation in which we found ourselves and still find ourselves to this day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt; This applied also to strictures of religion. Jean-JosÃ© Puig describes how Massoud often led prayers before a meal or at times asked his fellow Muslims to lead the prayer but also did not hesitate to ask a Christian friend Jean-JosÃ© Puig or the Jewish [[Princeton University]] Professor Michael Barry: &quot;Jean-JosÃ©, we believe in the same God. Please, tell us the prayer before lunch or dinner in your own language.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster University Press Book&quot;/&gt;

Human Rights Watch cites no human rights crimes for the forces under direct control of Massoud for the period from October 1996 until the assassination of Massoud in September 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/afghan-bck1005.htm#uf |title = Human Rights Watch Backgrounder, October 2001| publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One million peolple fled the Taliban, many to the area of Massoud.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |url =http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/episode/inside-the-taliban-3274/Overview|title =Inside the Taliban | publisher = [[National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Geographic]] concluded in its documentary ''&quot;Inside the Taliban&quot;'':
{{blockquote|The only thing standing in the way of future Taliban massacres is [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;National Geographic&quot;/&gt;}}
The Taliban repeatedly offered Massoud a position of power to make him stop his resistance. Massoud declined. He explained in one interview:
:&quot;The Taliban say: &quot;Come and accept the post of prime minister and be with us&quot;, and they would keep the highest office in the country, the presidentship. But for what price?! The difference between us concerns mainly our way of thinking about the very principles of the society and the state. We can not accept their conditions of compromise, or else we would have to give up the principles of modern democracy. We are fundamentally against the system called &quot;the Emirate of Afghanistan&quot;.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.orient.uw.edu.pl/balcerowicz/texts/Ahmad_Shah_Masood_en.htm |title =The Last Interview with Ahmad Shah Massoud | publisher = Piotr Balcerowicz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&quot;There should be an Afghanistan where every Afghan finds himself or herself happy. And I think that can only be assured by democracy based on consensus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; /&gt;
Massoud with his [http://www.peace-initiatives.com/frame.htm Proposals for Peace] wanted to convince the Taliban to join a political process leading towards nationwide democratic elections in a foreseeable future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;  Massoud also stated:
:&quot;The Taliban are not a force to be considered invincible. They are distanced from the people now. They are weaker than in the past. There is only the assistance given by Pakistan, Osama bin Laden and other extremist groups that keep the Taliban on their feet. With a halt to that assistance, it is extremely difficult to survive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2002|url =http://www.sptimes.com/2002/09/09/911/The_man_who_would_hav.shtml |title =The man who would have led Afghanistan| publisher = [[St. Petersburg Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Massoud 2000.jpg|thumb|left|290px|In spring 2001 the anti-Taliban leader [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] stated that the Taliban and [[Al Qaeda]] had introduced &quot;a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]&quot; and warned about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.]]
In early 2001 Massoud employed a new strategy of local military pressure and global political appeals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Steve Coll| authorlink = Steve Coll| title =Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |edition=February 23, 2004 |page=720| publisher =Penguin Press HC | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resentment was increasingly gathering against Taliban rule from the bottom of Afghan society including the Pashtun areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot; /&gt; Massoud publicized their cause &quot;popular consensus, general elections and democracy&quot; worldwide.

In early 2001 Ahmad Shah Massoud addressed the [[European Parliament]] in [[Brussels]] asking the [[international community]] to provide [[humanitarian]] help to the people of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament (2)&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1iCsEnXdIw |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher = EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 see video]) He stated that the Taliban and [[Al Qaeda]] had introduced &quot;a very wrong perception of [[Islam]]&quot; and that without the support of Pakistan and Bin Laden the Taliban would not be able to sustain their military campaign for up to a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2001|url =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t78N6Q5VD60 |title = Massoud in the European Parliament 2001| publisher =EU media}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On this visit to Europe he also warned that his intelligence had gathered information about a large-scale attack on U.S. soil being imminent.&lt;ref name=&quot;gwu.edu&quot;&gt;Defense Intelligence Agency (2001) report [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/tal32.pdf GWU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2001, Massoud, then aged 48, was the target of a [[suicide attack]] by two Arabs posing as journalists at Khwaja Bahauddin, in the [[Takhar Province]] of Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/10/world/taliban-foe-hurt-and-aide-killed-by-bomb.html |title=Taliban Foe Hurt and Aide Killed by Bomb |location=Afghanistan |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=September 10, 2001 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burns |first=John F. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/09/world/threats-responses-assassination-afghans-too-mark-day-disaster-hero-was-lost.html |title=Threats and responses: assassination; Afghans, Too, Mark a Day of Disaster: A Hero Was Lost |location=Afghanistan |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=September 9, 2002 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massoud died in a helicopter taking him to a hospital. The funeral, though in a rather rural area, was attended by hundreds of thousands of mourning people.[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq-zqA1DMWs Sad day] (video clip).

The assassination was not the first time Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], and before them the Soviet [[KGB]], the Afghan Communist [[KHAD]] and [[Hekmatyar]] had tried to assassinate Massoud. He survived countless assassination attempts over a period of 26 years. The first attempt on Massoud's life was carried out by Hekmatyar and two Pakistani ISI agents in 1975, when Massoud was only 22 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;/&gt; In early 2001, Al-Qaeda would-be assassins were captured by Massoud's forces while trying to enter his territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve Coll: Ghost Wars&quot; /&gt; The assassination of Massoud may have had a connection to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on U.S. soil, which killed nearly 3000 people, and which appeared to be the terrorist attack that Massoud had warned against in his speech to the European Parliament several months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boettcher|first=Mike|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-11-06/us/massoud.cable_1_bin-qaeda-sheikh-osama?_s=PM:US|title=How much did Afghan leader know?|publisher=CNN.com|date=November 6, 2003|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John P. O'Neill]] was a counter-terrorism expert and the Assistant Director of the [[FBI]] until late 2001. He retired from the FBI and was offered the position of director of security at the [[World Trade Center]] (WTC). He took the job at the WTC two weeks before 9/11. On September 10, 2001, O'Neill told two of his friends, &quot;We're due. And we're due for something big.... Some things have happened in Afghanistan. [referring to the assassination of Massoud] I don't like the way things are lining up in Afghanistan.... I sense a shift, and I think things are going to happen ... soon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=2002 |url =http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/knew/etc/script.html|title =The Man Who Knew | publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Neill died on September 11, 2001, when the [[South Tower]] collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot; /&gt;

After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Massoud's United Front troops ousted the Taliban from power in Kabul with American air support in [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]]. In November and December 2001 the United Front gained control of much of the country and played a crucial role in establishing the post-Taliban interim government of Hamid Karzai in late 2001.

===NATO invasion, Taliban overthrow and insurgency===
{{Main|War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)}}

====Prelude====
After the September 11 attacks on the U.S. and the [[PENTTBOM]] investigation, the United States made the following demands of the Taliban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/ |title=United States ultimatum |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date= September 21, 2001|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refused to discuss them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Deliver to the U.S. all of the leaders of Al-Qaeda
# Release all foreign nationals that have been &quot;unjustly imprisoned&quot;
# Protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers
# Close immediately every terrorist training camp
# Hand over every terrorist and their supporters to appropriate authorities
# Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps for inspection
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The U.S. petitioned the international community to back a military campaign to overthrow the Taliban. The U.N. issued two resolutions on terrorism after the Sept.11 attacks. The resolutions called on all states to &quot;[increase] cooperation and full implementation of the relevant international conventions relating to terrorism&quot; and specified consensus recommendations for all countries. The Security Council did not authorize military intervention in Afghanistan of any kind, and nowhere in the U.N resolutions did it say military operations in Afghanistan were justified or conformed to international law.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations S.C. Res. 1368, September 12, 2001; S.C. Res. 1373, 2001-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, NATO approved a campaign against Afghanistan as self-defense against armed attack.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by the North Atlantic Council, September 12, 2001, in Press Release 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, the Taliban responded to the ultimatum, promising that if the U.S. could bring evidence that bin Laden was guilty, they would [[Extradition|hand him over]], stating that they had no evidence linking him to the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS21Oct01&quot;/&gt;

On September 22, the [[United Arab Emirates]], and later [[Saudi Arabia]], withdrew recognition of the Taliban as Afghanistan's legal government, leaving neighbouring Pakistan as the only remaining country with diplomatic ties. On October 4, the Taliban agreed to turn bin Laden over to Pakistan for trial in an international [[tribunal]]&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.j-n-v.org/AW_briefings/ARROW_briefing005.htm JNV briefing].&lt;/ref&gt; that operated according to Islamic ''[[Sharia]]'' law, but Pakistan blocked the offer as it was not possible to guarantee his safety.&lt;ref&gt;
Bishop, P., [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/10/04/wpak04.xml Pakistan Halts Secret Plan for bin Laden Trial], ''Daily Telegraph'', 2001-10-04.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 7, the Taliban ambassador to Pakistan offered to detain bin Laden and try him under Islamic law if the U.S. made a formal request and presented the Taliban with evidence. A Bush administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, rejected the Taliban offer, and stated that the U.S. would not negotiate their demands.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/ret.us.taliban/ Taliban offers to try bin Laden in an Islamic court].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coalition attack====
Still on October 7, and less than one month after the Twin Towers fell, the U.S., aided by the United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries including several from the NATO alliance, initiated [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|military action]], bombing Taliban and Al-Qaeda-related camps.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/07/gen.america.under.attack/ The United States declares war on the Taliban].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/enduring-freedom.htm Operation Enduring Freedom].&lt;/ref&gt; The stated intent of military operations was to remove the Taliban from power, and prevent the use of Afghanistan as a [[terrorist]] base of operations.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2001/10/mil-011007-usia01.htm Intentions of U.S. military operation].&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD) units were the first U.S. forces to enter Afghanistan (noting that many different countries intelligence agencies were on the ground or operating within theatre before SAD, and that SAD are not technically military forces, but civilian paramilitaries). They joined with the Afghan United Front ([[Northern Alliance]]) to prepare for the subsequent arrival of U.S. Special Operations forces. The United Front (Northern Alliance) and SAD and Special Forces combined to overthrow the Taliban with minimal coalition casualties, and without the use of international conventional ground forces. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated in an editorial by John Lehman in 2006:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What made the Afghan campaign a landmark in the U.S. Military's history is that it was prosecuted by Special Operations forces from all the services, along with [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] tactical power, operations by the Afghan Northern Alliance and the CIA were equally important and fully integrated. No large [[United States Army|Army]] or [[United States Marine|Marine]] force was employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083002730.html|title=We're Not Winning This War|publisher=Washington Post|date=August 31, 2006 |accessdate=December 3, 2009 | first=John | last=Lehman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On October 14, the Taliban offered to discuss handing over Osama bin Laden to a neutral country in return for a bombing halt, but only if the Taliban were given evidence of bin Laden's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.guardian.co.uk/waronterror/story/0,1361,573975,00.html Taliban offers to hand bin Laden to a neutral nation for trial].&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. rejected this offer, and continued military operations. [[Mazari Sharif]] fell November 9, triggering a cascade of provinces falling with minimal resistance. Many local forces switched loyalties from the Taliban to the Northern Alliance. On the night of November 12, the Taliban retreated south from Kabul. On November 15, they released eight Western [[aid worker]]s after [[Attacks on humanitarian workers|three months in captivity]]. By November 13, the Taliban had withdrawn from both Kabul and [[Jalalabad]]. Finally, in early December, the Taliban gave up [[Kandahar]], their last stronghold, dispersing without surrendering.

The continued support from tribal and other groups in Pakistan, the drug trade, and the small number of NATO forces, combined with the long history of resistance and isolation, indicated that Taliban forces and leaders were surviving. [[Suicide attack]]s and other terrorist methods not used in 2001 became more common. Observers suggested that [[poppy]] eradication, which destroys the livelihoods of rural Afghans, and civilian deaths caused by airstrikes encouraged the resurgence.

In September 2006, Pakistan recognized the [[Islamic Emirate of Waziristan]], an association of [[Waziristan]]i chieftains with close ties to the Taliban, as the de facto security force for Waziristan. This recognition was part of the agreement to end the [[War in North-West Pakistan|Waziristan War]], which had exacted a heavy toll on the [[Pakistan Army]] since early 2004. Some commentators viewed [[Islamabad]]'s shift from war to diplomacy as implicit recognition of the growing power of the resurgent Taliban relative to American influence, with the U.S. distracted by the threat of looming crises in [[Iraq]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Iran]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Other commentators viewed Islamabad's shift from war to diplomacy as an effort to appease growing discontent.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://spaces.brad.ac.uk:8080/display/ssispsru/Home Pakistan Security Research Unit (PSRU)].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the Taliban's leadership structure, Mullah Dadullah's [[targeted killing]] in May 2007 did not have a significant effect, other than to damage incipient relations with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The Pashtun [[tribe|tribal group]], with over 40 million members (including Afghans and Pakistanis) had a [[Pashtun people#Pashtuns in the modern era|long history]] of resistance to occupation forces, so the Taliban may have comprised only a part of the insurgency. Most post-invasion Taliban fighters were new recruits, mostly drawn from local madrasas.

In early December, the Taliban offered to give the U.S. &quot;legal guarantees&quot; that it would not allow Afghanistan to be used for attacks on other countries. The U.S. ignored the offer, and continued military action.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;/&gt;

====Targeted killings====
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
[[File:081131-F-7734Q-001.jpg|thumb|right|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] drone]]
The United States and United Kingdom have used [[targeted killings]], mainly by SOF forces, and sometimes by [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]s, to kill Taliban leaders.  British forces also used similar tactics, as well as [[United Kingdom Special Forces]], to eliminate individual Taliban commanders, mostly in [[Helmand Province]], Afghanistan.  Among the more notable of the targeted killings of Taliban:

*In June 2004, the U.S. killed [[Nek Muhammad Wazir]], a Taliban commander and al-Qaeda facilitator, along with five others, in an apparent [[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] missile strike in [[South Waziristan]], Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestandard1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=17&amp;art_id=10999&amp;sid=6456022&amp;con_type=1|author=Josh Meyer |title=CIA beefs killer drone force |work=The Standard |date=January 31, 2006 |accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dhs20040621&gt;{{cite news| url=http://osd.gov.com/osd/200406_june/DHS_IAIP_Daily_2004-06-21.pdf

====Civilian casualties====
According to a report by the [[United Nations]], the Taliban were responsible for 76 % of civilian casualties in Afghanistan in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:afghan 082.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], former Commander of British Forces in Afghanistan]]
According to [[Human Rights Watch]], the Taliban's bombings and other attacks which have led to civilian casualties &quot;sharply escalated in 2006&quot; when &quot;at least 669 Afghan civilians were killed in at least 350 armed attacks, most of which appear to have been intentionally launched at non-combatants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/04/16/afghan15688.htm Human Rights News, Afghanistan: Civilians Bear Cost of Escalating Insurgent Attacks].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/afghanistan0407/ The Consequences of Insurgent Attacks in Afghanistan], April 2007, Volume 19, No. 6(C).&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, the Taliban had increased its use of suicide bombers and targeted unarmed civilian [[aid worker]]s, such as [[Gayle Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7679212.stm |title=South Asia &amp;#124; UK charity worker killed in Kabul|publisher=BBC News |date=October 20, 2008 |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations reported that the number of civilians killed by both the Taliban and pro-government forces in the war rose nearly 50% between 2007 and 2009. In the first half of 2008, the Taliban killed 495 civilians, and the allies 276.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnoldy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0731/p06s15-wosc.html |title=In Afghanistan, Taliban kills more civilians than US |date= 2009-07-31 |author=Ben Arnoldy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high number of civilians killed by the Taliban is blamed in part on their increasing use of [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), &quot;for instance, 16 IEDs have been planted in girls' schools&quot; by the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnoldy&quot;/&gt;

'''Criticism of tactics and strategy'''

In 2009, Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], formerly Commander of British forces in Afghanistan and the intelligence coordinator for the British government, drew parallels between the tactics and strategy of [[Hamas]] in [[Gaza]] to those of the Taliban. Kemp wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Like Hamas in Gaza, the Taliban in southern Afghanistan are masters at shielding themselves behind the civilian population and then melting in among them for protection. Women and children are trained and equipped to fight, collect intelligence, and ferry arms and ammunition between battles. Female suicide bombers are increasingly common. The use of women to shield gunmen as they engage [[NATO]] forces is now so normal it is deemed barely worthy of comment. Schools and houses are routinely booby-trapped. Snipers shelter in houses deliberately filled with women and children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/analysis/analysis_280909_goldstone_kemp.html The UN Goldstone Commission: A Lesson in Farcical Hypocrisy], Defense Update.

==Ideology==
===Overview===
{{Islamism sidebar}}
The Taliban initially enjoyed goodwill from Afghans weary of the warlords' corruption, brutality, and incessant fighting.&lt;ref&gt;
Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim world / editor in chief, Richard C. Martin, Macmillan Reference USA : Thomson/Gale, c2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, this popularity was not universal, particularly among non-Pashtuns.

The Taliban's extremely strict and [[Development criticism|anti-modern]] ideology has been described as an &quot;innovative form of ''[[sharia]]'' combining Pashtun tribal codes,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Muslim World 2004&quot;&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World,'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Pashtunwali]], with radical [[Deobandi]] interpretations of Islam favored by JUI and its splinter groups. Also contributing to the mix was the [[jihad]]ism and [[pan-Islamism]] of Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=132, 139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideology was a departure from the [[Islamism]] of the anti-Soviet mujahideen rulers they replaced who tended to be mystical [[Sufism|Sufis]], traditionalists, or radical Islamicists inspired by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] (Ikhwan).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=87}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Taliban regime, [[Sharia law]] was interpreted to forbid a wide variety of previously lawful activities in Afghanistan. One Taliban list of prohibitions included:
pork, pig, pig oil, anything made from human hair, satellite dishes, cinematography, and equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computers, VCRs, television, anything that propagates sex and is full of music, wine, lobster, nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Waldman | first = Amy }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also got rid of employment, education, and sports for all women, dancing, clapping during sports events, kite flying, and characterizations of living things, no matter if they were drawings, paintings, photographs, stuffed animals, or dolls. Men had to have a fist size beard at the bottom of their chin. Conversely, they had to wear their head hair short. Men had to wear a head covering.&lt;ref name=&quot;cr&quot;&gt;
[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2001/sa/8222.htm US Country Report on Human Rights Practices â Afghanistan 2001].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these activities were hitherto lawful in Afghanistan. Critics complained that most Afghans followed a different, less strict, and less intrusive interpretation of Islam. The Taliban did not eschew all traditional popular practices. For example, they did not destroy the graves of Sufi [[Pir (Sufism)|pirs]] (holy men), and emphasized dreams as a means of revelation.&lt;ref&gt;
Roy, Olivier, ''Globalized Islam'', Columbia University Press, 2004, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikiquote|religious police}}

Taliban have been described as both anti-nationalist and Pushtun nationalist. According to journalist [[Ahmed Rashid]], at least in the first years of their rule, they adopted [[Deobandi]] and [[Islamist]] anti-nationalist beliefs, and opposed &quot;tribal and feudal structures,&quot; eliminating traditional tribal or feudal leaders from leadership roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ali A. Jalali and Lester Grau, the Taliban &quot;received extensive support from Pashtuns across the country who thought that the movement might restore their national dominance. Even Pashtun intellectuals in the West, who differed with the Taliban on many issues, expressed support for the movement on purely ethnic grounds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/990306-taliban.htm Foreign Military Studies Office, &quot;Whither the Taliban?&quot; by Mr. Ali A. Jalali and Mr. Lester W. Grau ].&lt;/ref&gt;

Like ''Wahhabi'' and other Deobandis, the Taliban do not consider [[Shia Islam|Shi{{okina}}i]] to be Muslims. The Shia in Afghanistan consist mostly of the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group which totaled almost 10% of Afghanistan's population.&lt;ref name = &quot;hrw.org-Niazi&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports98/afghan/Afrepor0-03.htm#P186_38364 |title=Human Rights Watch Report, `Afghanistan, the massacre in Mazar-e-Sharif`, November 1998. |chapter=IV. Incitement of violence against Hazaras by governor Niazi |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban were averse to debating doctrine with other Muslims. &quot;The Taliban did not allow even Muslim reporters to question [their] edicts or to discuss interpretations of the [[Qur'an]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 107&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=107}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of women===
{{Main|Taliban treatment of women}}
[[File:Taliban beating woman in public RAWA.jpg|right|thumb|Taliban [[Mutaween#Other groups|religious police]] beating a woman in [[Kabul]] on August 26, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawa.us/movies/beating.mpg |title=Rawa.us |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01 |work=Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Taliban forced women to wear the [[burqa]] in public.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gohari&quot;&gt;MJ Gohari (2000). ''The Taliban: Ascent to Power''.  Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 108â10.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were allowed neither to work nor to be educated after the age of eight, and until then were permitted only to study the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Maley&quot;/&gt; They were not allowed to be treated by male doctors unless accompanied by a male [[Chaperone (clinical)|chaperon]], which led to illnesses remaining untreated. They faced public flogging in the street, and [[public execution]] for violations of the Taliban's laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;physicians&quot;/&gt;

Employment for women was restricted to the medical sector, because male medical personnel were not allowed to look at them. One result of the banning of employment of women by the Taliban was the closing down in places like Kabul of primary schools not only for girls but for boys, because almost all the teachers there were women.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, Ahmed. ''Taliban''. Yale Nota Bene Books, 2000, p.106.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were required to wear the ''[[burqa]]'', a traditional dress covering the entire body except for a small screen to see out of. Taliban restrictions became more severe after they took control of the capital.  In February 1998, religious police forced all women off the streets of Kabul, and issued new regulations ordering people to blacken their windows, so that women would not be visible from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, Ahmed. ''Taliban''. Yale Nota Bene Books, 2000, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bamyan Buddhas===
[[File:Destruction of Buddhas March 21 2001.jpg|thumb|Destruction of [[Buddhas of Bamyan|Bamyan Buddha statue]]s by the Taliban]]
In 1999, Mullah Omar issued a decree protecting the [[Buddhas of Bamyan|Buddha statues at Bamyan]], two 6th century monumental statues of standing [[buddha]]s carved into the side of a cliff in the [[Bamyan, Afghanistan|Bamyan]] valley in the [[Hazarajat]] region of central Afghanistan. He did this because Afghanistan had no [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], so [[idolatry]] would not be a problem. But in March 2001 the statues were destroyed by the Taliban of Mullah Omar following a decree stating: &quot;all the statues around Afghanistan must be destroyed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luke Harding |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4145138,00.html |title=How the Buddha got his wounds|date=March 3, 2001|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=August 27, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahya Massoud, brother of the anti-Taliban and resistance leader [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], recalls the following incident after the destruction of the Buddha statues at Bamyan:
:''&quot;It was the spring of 2001. I was in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, together with my brother Ahmad Shah Massoud, the leader of the Afghan resistance against the Taliban, and Bismillah Khan, who currently serves as Afghanistan's interior minister. One of our commanders, Commandant Momin, wanted us to see 30 Taliban fighters who had been taken hostage after a gun battle. My brother agreed to meet them.

:''I remember that his first question concerned the centuries-old Buddha statues that were dynamited by the Taliban in March of that year, shortly before our encounter. Two Taliban combatants from Kandahar confidently responded that worshiping anything outside of Islam was unacceptable and that therefore these statues had to be destroyed. My brother looked at them and said, this time in Pashto, 'There are still many sun- worshippers in this country. Will you also try to get rid of the sun and drop darkness over the Earth?'&quot;''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yahya Massoud|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/30/afghans_can_win_this_war|title=Afghans Can Win This War |date=July 2010|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate= |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explanation of ideology===
The author Ahmed Rashid suggests that the devastation and hardship of the Soviet invasion and the following period influenced Taliban ideology.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 32&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban were often &quot;barely literate,&quot; and did not include scholars learned in Islamic law and history. The refugee students, brought up in a totally male society, not only had no education in mathematics, science, history or geography, but also had no traditional skills of farming, [[herding]], or [[handicraft]]-making, nor even knowledge of their tribal and clan [[Kinship|lineages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 32&quot;/&gt; In such an environment, war meant employment, peace meant unemployment. Dominating women simply affirmed manhood. For their leadership, rigid fundamentalism was a matter not only of principle, but of political survival. Taliban leaders &quot;repeatedly told&quot; Rashid that &quot;if they gave women greater freedom or a chance to go to school, they would lose the support of their rank and file.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
The Taliban were criticized for their strictness toward those who disobeyed their imposed rules. Many Muslims complained that most Taliban rules had no basis in the [[Qur'an]] or [[sharia]]. [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]]'s title as [[Amir al-Mu'minin]] was criticized on the grounds that he lacked scholarly learning, tribal pedigree, or connections to the [[Prophet Mohammed|Prophet's]] family. Sanction for the title traditionally required the support of all of the country's [[ulema]], whereas only some 1,200 Pashtun Taliban-supporting Mullahs had declared Omar the Amir. &quot;No Afghan had adopted the title since 1834, when King [[Dost Mohammed Khan]] assumed the title before he declared jihad against the [[Sikh]] kingdom in [[Peshawar]]. But Dost Mohammed was fighting foreigners, while Omar had declared jihad against other Afghans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 41-42&quot;/&gt;

Another criticism was that the Taliban called their 20% tax on truckloads of opium &quot;[[zakat]]&quot;, which is traditionally limited to 2.5% of the zakat-payers' disposable income (or wealth).&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 41-42&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=41â42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
===Overview===
[[File:Taliban-herat-2001 retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|A pickup truck with Taliban police in it patrolling the streets of [[Herat]]]]
Rashid described the Taliban government as &quot;a secret society run by [[Kandahar]]is ... mysterious, secretive, and dictatorial.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashid 2000 98&quot;/&gt; They did not hold elections, as their spokesman explained:

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt; The ''[[Sharia]]'' does not allow politics or political parties. That is why we give no salaries to officials or soldiers, just food, clothes, shoes, and weapons. We want to live a life like the Prophet lived 1400 years ago, and ''[[jihad]]'' is our right. We want to recreate the time of the Prophet, and we are only carrying out what the Afghan people have wanted for the past 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=43}} Interview with Mullah Wakil, March 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

They modeled their decision-making process on the Pashtun tribal council (''[[jirga]]''), together with what they believed to be the early Islamic model. Discussion was followed by a building of a consensus by the &quot;believers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before capturing Kabul, there was talk of stepping aside once a government of &quot;good Muslims&quot; took power, and law and order were restored.

As the Taliban's power grew, decisions were made by Mullah Omar without consulting the ''jirga'' and without consulting other parts of the country. He visited the capital, Kabul, only twice while in power. Instead of an election, their leader's legitimacy came from an oath of allegiance (&quot;[[Bay'ah]]&quot;), in imitation of the Prophet and the first four [[Caliph]]s. On April 4, 1996, Mullah Omar had &quot;the Cloak of the Prophet Mohammed&quot; taken from its shrine for the first time in 60 years. Wrapping himself in the relic, he appeared on the roof of a building in the center of Kandahar while hundreds of Pashtun [[mullah]]s below shouted &quot;[[Amir al-Mu'minin]]!&quot; (Commander of the Faithful), in a pledge of support. Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil explained:

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Decisions are based on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us consultation is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the ''Sharia''. We abide by the Amir's view even if he alone takes this view. There will not be a head of state. Instead there will be an Amir al-Mu'minin. Mullah Omar will be the highest authority, and the government will not be able to implement any decision to which he does not agree. General elections are incompatible with ''Sharia'' and therefore we reject them.&lt;ref&gt;
Interview with Taliban spokesman Mullah Wakil in Arabic magazine ''Al-Majallah'', 1996-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

The Taliban were very reluctant to share power, and since their ranks were overwhelmingly Pashtun they ruled as overlords over the 60% of Afghans from other ethnic groups. In local government, such as Kabul city council&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashid 2000 98&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=98}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or Herat,&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 39-40&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=39â40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taliban loyalists, not locals, dominated, even when the [[Pashto language|Pashto]]-speaking Taliban could not communicate with the roughly half of the population who spoke [[Dari]] or other non-Pashtun tongues.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 39-40&quot;/&gt; Critics complained that this &quot;lack of local representation in urban administration made the Taliban appear as an occupying force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 101-102&quot;/&gt;

===Organization===

[[File:Taliban in northern Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Taliban insurgents in northern Afghanistan after they surrendered to the [[Afghan National Police]].]]
Consistent with the governance of early Muslims was the absence of state institutions or &quot;a methodology for command and control&quot; that is standard today even among non-Westernized states. The Taliban did not issue press releases, policy statements, or hold regular press conferences. The outside world and most Afghans did not even know what their leaders looked like, since photography was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;regular army&quot; resembled a lashkar or traditional tribal [[militia]] force with only 25,000 men (of whom 11,000 where non-Afghans).

[[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] ministers and deputies were mullahs with a &quot;[[madrasah]] education.&quot; Several of them, such as the Minister of Health and Governor of the State bank, were primarily military commanders who left their administrative posts to fight when needed. Military reverses that trapped them behind lines or led to their deaths increased the chaos in the national administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=100}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, &quot;all senior [[TÄjik people|Tajik]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]] bureaucrats&quot; were replaced &quot;with Pashtuns, whether qualified or not.&quot; Consequently, the ministries &quot;by and large ceased to function.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 101-102&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=101â102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Finance had neither a budget nor &quot;qualified economist or banker.&quot; Mullah Omar collected and dispersed cash without book-keeping.

===Conscription===

According to the testimony of [[Guantanamo captive]]s before their [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]s, the Taliban, in addition to conscripting men to serve as soldiers, also conscripted men to staff its [[civil service]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Economy==

===Ariana airlines===
[[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] was a key node in Al Qaeda's infrastructure, which was to move money, personnel and materiel.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot;&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/18/news/mn-5593 Long Before Sept. 11, Bin Laden Aircraft Flew Under the Radar]. Los Angeles Times. 18 November 2001|&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Los Angeles Times:&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot; /&gt;
{{quote|With the Taliban's blessing, Bin Laden effectively had hijacked Ariana, the national civilian airline of Afghanistan. For four years, according to former U.S. aides and exiled Afghan officials, Ariana's passenger and charter flights ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash and opium through the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan. Members of Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network were provided false Ariana identification that gave them free run of airports in the Middle East.}}

===Opium===
{{See also|Opium production in Afghanistan}}
[[File:ANA soldier shows opium captured in an alleged Taliban safe house in Helmand.jpg|thumb|Opium in alleged Taliban safehouse in [[Helmand]]]]
[[Opium poppy|Opium poppies]] are a traditional crop in Afghanistan, and, with the war shattering other sectors of the economy, opium became its largest export.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The Taliban have provided an Islamic sanction for farmers ... to grow even more opium, even though the [[Koran]] forbids Muslims from producing or imbibing intoxicants. Abdul Rashid, the head of the Taliban's anti-drugs control force in Kandahar, spelled out the nature of his unique job. He is authorized to impose a strict ban on the growing of [[hashish]], &quot;because it is consumed by Afghans and Muslims.&quot; But, Rashid told me without a hint of sarcasm, &quot;Opium is permissible because it is consumed by [[kafir]]s in the West, and not by Muslims or Afghans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=118â119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2000 Afghanistan's opium production accounted for 75% of the world's supply. On July 27, 2000, the Taliban issued a decree banning cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opioids.com/ |title=Opioids homepage |publisher=opioids.com |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2001, production had reportedly been reduced from {{convert|12600|acre|km2|0}} to only {{convert|17|acres|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://opioids.com/afghanistan/index.html Afghanistan, Opium and the Taliban].&lt;/ref&gt; Opium production was reportedly cut back by the Taliban not to prevent its use, but to increase its price, and thus increase the income of Afghan poppy farmers and tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Daniel, ''The Age of Sacred Terror'' by Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, New York: Random House, c2002, p.145) (source: Edith M. Lederer, &quot;U.N. Panel Accuses Taliban of Selling Drugs to Finance War and Train Terrorists,&quot; [[Associated Press]], 2001-05-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 an article, citing &quot;American and Afghan officials&quot;, appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'' stating that the Taliban derive important funding from the opium trade but other sources such as foreign donations provide more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmitt |first=Eric |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/19/world/asia/19taliban.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=&quot;Many Sources Feed Talibanâs War Chest&quot; |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deforestation===
         
The so-called &quot;transportation mafia&quot; operating out of Pakistan working with the Taliban is accused to have &quot;cut down millions of acres of timber in Afghanistan for the Pakistani market, denuding the countryside without attempting reforestation. They stripped rusting factories, ... even electricity and telephone poles for their steel and sold the scrap to steel mills in [[Lahore]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=December 2011}}

===Emerald mines===
The Taliban took over [[emerald]] mines in Pakistan's [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] valley (not a tribal area), once the 'Switzerland of Pakistan', a popular tourist area for skiers. The government did not react to the move. The Taliban reached an agreement with the region's mining labor allowing the Taliban to keep one-third of the miners' output, while equally sharing costs. The Taliban does not take part in the mining operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/nwfp/taliban-take-over-swat-emerald-mines--za Taliban take over Swatâs emerald mines] ''[[Dawn Media Group]]'', 2009-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Taliban and [[Unocal]] negotiated arrangements for [[CentGas]] to build a [[Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline|gas pipeline]] from [[Turkmenistan]] to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/west_asia/37021.stm |title=Taleban in Texas for talks on gas pipeline |date=December 4, 1997 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, a deal was struck but later collapsed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/west_asia/21007.stm |title=Afghan Pipeline Deal Close |date=November 3, 1997 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; rumored to be because of competing negotiations with [[Bridas]], an [[Argentine]] company.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, &quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/s/w_asia/44521.stm Taliban says it's ready to sign Turkmen pipeline deal]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International relations==
During its time in power, the Taliban regime, or &quot;[[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]&quot;, gained [[diplomatic recognition]] from only three states: the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Saudi Arabia]], all of which provided substantial aid. The other nations including the [[United Nations]] recognized the government of the [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] (parts of whom were part of the United Front ([[Northern Alliance]]) as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

===Pakistan===
{{Main|Quetta Shura}}
The &quot;vast majority&quot; of the Taliban's rank and file and most of the leadership, though not Mullah Omar, were Koranic students who had studied at madrasas set up for [[Afghan refugees]], usually by JUI. [[Maulana Fazal-ur-Rehman]], JUI's leader, was a political ally of [[Benazir Bhutto]]. After Bhutto became prime minister, Rehman &quot;had access to the government, the army and the ISI,&quot; whom he influenced to help the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human Rights Watch writes, &quot;Pakistani aircraft assisted with troop rotations of Taliban forces during combat operations in late 2000 and ... senior members of Pakistan's intelligence agency and army were involved in planning military operations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3bd540b60.html | title=Crisis of Impunity|date = July 2001| work=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan provided military equipment, recruiting assistance, training, and tactical advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frantz|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially Pakistan denied supporting the Taliban militarily.

Author [[Ahmed Rashid]] claims that the Taliban had &quot;unprecedented access&quot; among Pakistan's lobbies and interest groups. He also writes that they at times were able to &quot;play off one lobby against another and extend their influence in Pakistan even further&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=185â186}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1998â99, Taliban-style groups in Pakistan's Pashtun belt, and to an extent in [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]], &quot;were banning TV and videos ... and forcing people, particularly women, to adapt to the Taliban dress code and way of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=93, 137}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the U.S. operation in Afghanistan the Afghan Taliban leadership is claimed to have fled to Pakistan where they regrouped and created several shuras to coordinate their insurgency in Afghanistan. On February 8, 2009, U.S. commander of operations in Afghanistan General [[Stanley McChrystal]] and other officials said that the Taliban leadership was in [[Quetta]], Pakistan, though the Pakistani government, an official U.S. ally, denied this.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot;/&gt;

A range of officials inside and outside Pakistan have stepped up suggestions of links between the ISI and terrorist groups in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/pakistan/isi-terrorism-behind-accusations/p11644 |title=The ISI and Terrorism: Behind the Accusations - Council on Foreign Relations |publisher=Cfr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2006, a leaked report by a British Defense Ministry think tank charged, &quot;Indirectly Pakistan (through the ISI) has been supporting terrorism and extremism--whether in London on 7/7 [the July 2005 attacks on London's transit system], or in Afghanistan, or Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; In June 2008, Afghan officials accused Pakistan's intelligence service of plotting a failed assassination attempt on President Hamid Karzai; shortly thereafter, they implied the ISI's involvement in a July 2008 Taliban attack on the Indian embassy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; Indian officials also blamed the ISI for the bombing of the Indian embassy.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; Numerous U.S. officials have also accused the ISI of supporting terrorist groups including the Afghan Taliban. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said &quot;to a certain extent, they play both sides.&quot; Gates and others suggest the ISI maintains links with groups like the Afghan Taliban as a &quot;strategic hedge&quot; to help Islamabad gain influence in Kabul once U.S. troops exit the region.
&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;/&gt; U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen in 2011 called the [[Haqqani network]] (the Afghan Taliban's most destructive element) a &quot;veritable arm of Pakistan's ISI&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;longwarjournal1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas |last=Joscelyn |date=September 22, 2011 |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2011/09/admiral_mullen_pakis.php |title=Admiral Mullen: Pakistani ISI sponsoring Haqqani attacks |publisher=The Long War Journal |date=2011-09-22 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated, &quot;Extremist organizations serving as proxies of the government of Pakistan are attacking Afghan troops and civilians as well as US soldiers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;longwarjournal1&quot;/&gt;

From 2010, a report by a leading British institution also claimed that Pakistan's intelligence service still today has a strong link with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Published by the [[London School of Economics]], the report said that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI) has an &quot;official policy&quot; of support for the Taliban. It said the ISI provides funding and training for the Taliban, and that the agency has representatives on the so-called [[Quetta Shura]], the Taliban's leadership council, which is believed to meet in Pakistan. The report, based on interviews with Taliban commanders in Afghanistan, was written by Matt Waldman, a fellow at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/mritems/Documents/2010/6/13/20106138531279734lse-isi-taliban.pdf |title=Discussion Papers |accessdate=12 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Pakistan appears to be playing a double-game of astonishing magnitude,&quot; the report said. The report also linked high-level members of the Pakistani government with the Taliban. It said [[Asif Ali Zardari]], the Pakistani president, met with senior Taliban prisoners in 2010 and promised to release them. Zardari reportedly told the detainees they were only arrested because of American pressure.  &quot;The Pakistan government's apparent duplicity â and awareness of it among the American public and political establishment â could have enormous geopolitical implications,&quot; Waldman said. &quot;Without a change in Pakistani behaviour it will be difficult if not impossible for international forces and the Afghan government to make progress against the insurgency.&quot; Afghan officials have long been suspicious of the ISI's role. [[Amrullah Saleh]], the former director of Afghanistan's intelligence service, told Reuters that the ISI was &quot;part of a landscape of destruction in this country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6571VE20100608 | title=Afghan ex-intel chief opposed Karzai peace plan | date=June 8, 2010 | work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan on other hand has strongly denied all links with Taliban or any terrorist groups with the argument that Pakistan is the biggest victim of the &quot;War on terror&quot; with a loss of 35,000 lives including policemen, soldiers and mostly civilians.&lt;ref name=Pakdenies&gt;{{cite news|last=Chris Allbritton|title=Pakistan strongly denied Thursday a BBC report that alleged the Pakistani military, along with its intelligence arm, supplied and protected the Afghan Taliban and al Qaeda.|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/27/us-pakistan-taliban-bbc-idUSTRE79Q7V420111027|accessdate=Thu Oct 27, 2011|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's military officials called such allegations highly biased and factually inaccurate.

Afghan Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] asked the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in late 2008 and early 2009 to stop attacks inside Pakistan, to change their focus as an organization and to fight the [[Afghan National Army]] and [[ISAF]] forces in [[Afghanistan]] instead.&lt;ref name=gall2009327/&gt;  In late December 2008 and early January 2009 he sent a delegation, led by former [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay detainee]] [[Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul|Mullah Abdullah Zakir]], to persuade leading members of the TTP to put aside differences with Pakistan.&lt;ref name=gall2009327/&gt;

Some regional experts state the common name &quot;Taliban&quot; may be more misleading than illuminating.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;
Gilles Dorronsoro, a scholar of [[South Asia]] currently at the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in Washington says:
:&quot;The fact that they have the same name causes all kinds of confusion.&quot;&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;
As the Pakistani Army began offensives against the Pakistani Taliban, many unfamiliar with the region thought incorrectly that the assault was against the Afghan Taliban of Mullah Omar which was not the case.&lt;ref name=scott/&gt;

The Pakistani Taliban were put under sanctions by [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]] for terrorists attacks in Pakistan and [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]].&lt;ref name=sanctionsunc&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/report/unsc-slaps-sanctions-on-pakistani-taliban/20110730.htm UNSC slaps sanctions on Pakistani Taliban], July 30, 2011, rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malakand Taliban===
Malakand Taliban is militant outfit led by Sufi Muhammad and his son in law Molvi Fazalullah.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url_a&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Akbar |last=Mayo |url=http://outlookafghanistan.net/topics.php?post_id=828 |title=Rise of Malakand Taliban |publisher=The Daily Outlook Afghanistan |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufi Muhammad is in government custody, however, Molvi Fazalullah is believed to be in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url_a&quot; /&gt; In the last week of May 2011, eight security personnel and civilians fell victim to four hundred armed Taliban who attacked Shaltalo check post in Dir, a frontier District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, located few kilometers away from Afghan border.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url_a&quot; /&gt;
Although, they have been linked with Waziristan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), however, the connection between these two groups is of symbolic nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url_a&quot; /&gt;

===Al Qaeda===
[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden.jpg|thumb|Pakistani journalist [[Hamid Mir]] sitting with [[Osama bin Laden]] in 1997.]]
In 1996, bin Laden moved to Afghanistan from [[Sudan]]. He came without invitation, and sometimes irritated Mullah Omar with his declaration of war and fatwas against citizens of third-party countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=246â247, 287â288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but relations between the two groups improved over time, to the point that Mullah Omar rebuffed his group's patron Saudi Arabia, insulting Saudi minister [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud|Prince Turki]] while reneging on an earlier promise to turn bin Laden over to the Saudis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=288â289}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden was able to forge an [[Military alliance|alliance]] between the Taliban and [[Al-Qaeda]]. The Al Qaeda-trained [[055 Brigade]] integrated with the Taliban army between 1997 and 2001. Several hundred Arab Afghan fighters sent by bin Laden assisted the Taliban in the [[Mazar-e-Sharif]] slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called Brigade 055 was also responsible for massacres against civilians in other parts of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1340244/Afghanistan-resistance-leader-feared-dead-in-blast.html |title =Afghanistan resistance leader feared dead in blast| publisher = [[Ahmed Rashid in the Telegraph]]|location=London|date=September 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996 to 2001 the organization of Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become a virtual state within the Taliban state.

Taliban-Al-Qaeda connections were also strengthened by the reported marriage of one of bin Laden's sons to Omar's daughter. While in Afghanistan, bin Laden may have helped finance the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&amp;id=1328 International Terrorism And the Case Of Usama bin Laden], Lebanese Army Website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, [[Lawrence Wright]] claims bin Laden was almost completely broke at this time, cut off from his family income and fleeced by the Sudanese.{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=222â223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in Africa, [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists#Osama bin Laden|bin Laden]] and several Al-Qaeda members were indicted in U.S. criminal court.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/binladen/usbinladen1.pdf PDF of indictments].&lt;/ref&gt; The Taliban rejected [[extradition]] requests by the U.S., variously claiming that bin Laden had &quot;gone missing&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, the Taliban was in talks to sever all ties with Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview | work=CNN | title=Sources: Taliban split with al Qaeda, seek peace | accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Alex Strick van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn at New York University's Center on International Cooperation proclaimed that the two groups did not get along at times before the September 11 attacks, and they have continued to spar since. Contrary to the established perception that they are of one mind, the Taliban and al-Qaeda are not in lockstep. In fact, the Taliban in Afghanistan could be persuaded to renounce the infamous terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Noel |last=Brinkerhoff |url=http://www.allgov.com/US_and_the_World/ViewNews/Surprise_Taliban_and_Al_Qaeda_are_Worlds_Apart_110209 |title=Surprise!

===Iran===
Iran has historically been an enemy of the Taliban. In early August 1998, after attacking the city of [[Mazar]], Taliban forces killed several thousand civilians and 10 Iranian diplomats and intelligence officers in the Iranian consulate. Alleged radio intercepts indicate Mullah Omar personally approved the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=74â75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following crisis between Iran and the Taliban, the Iranian government amassed up to 200,000 regular troops on the Afghan-Iranian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John |last=Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/1998/09/wwwh8915.html |title=Iranian-Afghan tensions |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=1998-09-15 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; War was eventually averted.

===United States===
Foreign powers, including the United States, briefly supported the Taliban, hoping it would restore order in the war-ravaged country. For example, it made no comment when the Taliban captured Herat in 1995, and expelled thousands of girls from schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These hopes faded as the Taliban began killing unarmed civilians, targeting ethnic groups (primarily Hazaras), and restricting the rights of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muslim World 2004&quot;/&gt; In late 1997, American Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]] began to distance the U.S. from the Taliban. The next year, the American-based oil company [[Unocal]] withdrew from negotiations on pipeline construction from Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/west_asia/38115.stm | work=BBC News | title=US pledges support for Afghan oil pipeline if Taliban makes peace | date=December 10, 1997 | accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day before the capture of Mazar, bin Laden affiliates [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombed two U.S. embassies]] in Africa, killing 224 and wounding 4,500, mostly Africans. The U.S. responded by launching cruise missiles on suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan, killing over 20 though failing to kill bin Laden or even many Al-Qaeda. Mullah Omar condemned the missile attack and American President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;
Reuters, &quot;Taliban blame Clinton scam for attacks&quot;, 1998-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia expelled the Taliban envoy in protest over the refusal to turn over bin Laden, and after Mullah Omar allegedly insulted the Saudi royal family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=138, 231}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-October the U.N. [[Security Council]] voted unanimously to ban commercial aircraft flights to and from Afghanistan, and freeze its bank accounts worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjusting its [[counterinsurgency]] strategy, in October 2009, the U.S announced plans to pay Taliban fighters to switch sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/10/28/afghanistan.taliban.pay/index.html | work=CNN | title=U.S. set to pay Taliban members to switch sides | accessdate=April 9, 2010 | date=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--here--&gt;

On November 26, 2009, in an interview with [[CNN]]'s [[Christiane Amanpour]], President [[Hamid Karzai]] said there is an &quot;urgent need&quot; for negotiations with the Taliban, and made it clear that the Obama administration had opposed such talks. There was no formal American response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/text/news.asp?idnews=49701 |title=IPS Inter Press Service |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://amanpour.blogs.cnn.com/2009/12/06/right-after-interviewing-karzai/ | work=CNN | accessdate=April 9, 2010 | title=Right after interviewing&amp;nbsp;Karzai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2009, the Taliban offered to give the U.S. &quot;legal guarantees&quot; that they would not allow Afghanistan to be used for attacks on other countries. There was no formal American response.&lt;ref name=&quot;atimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KL17Df02.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news, business and economy from India and Pakistan |publisher=Atimes.com |date=December 17, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 6, U.S officials indicated that they have not ruled out talks with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Homan |first=Timothy R. |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aUO6eLdxBxqo&amp;pos=9 |title=bloomberg.com |publisher=bloomberg.com |date=December 6, 2009 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later it was reported that Gates saw potential for reconciliation with the Taliban, but not with Al-Qaeda. Furthermore, he said that reconciliation would politically end the insurgency and the war. But he said reconciliation must be on the Afghan government's terms, and that the Taliban must be subject to the sovereignty of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/666993 |title=Pentagon sees reconciliation with Taliban |publisher=stuff.co.nz |date=September 11, 2001 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, General McChrystal said his troop surge could lead to a negotiated peace with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) â Jan 24, 2010 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iKXQC2HwynedmTU1YcjQQFpyPA_g |title=google.com/hostednews/afp/article |publisher=Google.com |date=January 24, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allegations of connection to CIA'''
There have been many claims that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] directly supported the Taliban or [[Al-Qaeda]]. In the early 1980s, the CIA and the ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency) provided arms and money, and the ISI helped gather radical Muslims from around the world to fight against the Soviet invaders.&lt;ref name='R000321'&gt;{{cite news | first=Joseph | last=Fitchett | coauthors= | title=What About the Taliban's Stingers? | date=September 26, 2001 | publisher= | url =http://www.iht.com/articles/2001/09/26/stinger_ed3_.php | work =[[The International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | accessdate = November 11, 2008 | language = }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osama Bin Laden was one of the key players in organizing training camps for the foreign Muslim volunteers. &quot;By 1987, 65,000 tons of U.S.-made weapons and ammunition a year were entering the war.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
After 9/11, the United Kingdom froze the Taliban's assets in the U.K., nearly $200 million by early October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/stories/s380395.htm |title=AM Archive â UK freezes $200 million worth of Taliban assets |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.K. also supported the U.S. decision to remove the Taliban, both politically and militarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=bv4hzxpo424C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=%22united+kingdom%22+taliban#v=onepage&amp;q=%22united%20kingdom%22%20taliban&amp;f=false |title=Conflict in Afghanistan: a ... â Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=November 4, 2010|isbn=9781851094028|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN agreed that NATO would act on its behalf, focusing on counter-terrorist operations in Afghanistan after the Taliban had been &quot;defeated&quot;.  The United Kingdom took operational responsibility for [[Helmand Province]], a major poppy-growing province in southern Afghanistan, deploying troops there in the summer of 2006, and encountered resistance by re-formed Taliban forces allegedly entering Afghanistan from Pakistan.  The Taliban turned towards the use of [[improvised explosive devices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/2171923/General-Sir-Michael-Jackson-We-must-maintain-our-will-in-Afghanistan.html |title=General Sir Michael Jackson: We must maintain our will in Afghanistan |publisher=Telegraph |date=June 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 4, 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
India is one of the Taliban's most outspoken critics. India was concerned about growing Islamic militancy in its neighborhood, and refused to recognize the Taliban regime.&lt;ref&gt;

[http://www.rawa.org/massoud.htm Massoud joins hands with India].&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1999, [[Indian Airlines Flight 814]] en route from [[Kathmandu]] to [[Delhi]] was hijacked and taken to [[Kandahar]]. The Taliban moved its militias near the hijacked aircraft, supposedly to prevent [[Special Forces of India|Indian special forces]] from storming the aircraft, and stalled the negotiations between India and the hijackers for days.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' later reported that there were credible links between the hijackers and the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.rediff.com/news/2001/dec/07ter.htm Bombay terrorist reveals links with IC 814 hijackers].&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the deal to free the plane, India released three militants. The Taliban gave a safe passage to the hijackers and the released militants.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GH30Df01.html India reaches out to Afghanistan].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of recent [[Terrorism in India|terrorist attacks in India]], there have been growing concerns about fundamentalist organisations such as the Taliban seeking to expand their activities into India. During the [[2011 ICC Cricket World Cup]] which was co-hosted in India, Pakistani Interior Minister [[Rehman Malik]] and Interpol chief [[Ronald Noble]] revealed that a terrorist bid to disrupt the tournament had been foiled; following a conference with Noble, Malik said that the Taliban had begun to base their activities in India with reports from neighboring countries exposing their activities in the country and a Sri Lankan terrorist planning to target cricketers was arrested in Colombo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gishkori |first=Zahid |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/137011/terrorism-threat-in-india-during-world-cup-malik |title=Terrorism threat in India during World Cup |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=13081 |title=Taliban trying to enter India: Malik |publisher=The News |date=2011-03-24 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Terrorist-plotting-World-Cup-attack-nabbed-Rehman-Malik/articleshow/7781076.cms |title=Terrorist plotting World Cup attack nabbed: Rehman Malik |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kashmir]]-based militant groups thought to have ties with the Taliban have historically been involved in the [[Jammu and Kashmir insurgency]] in Indian-administered Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gall |first=Carlotta |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/world/asia/21quetta.html |title=At Border, Signs of Pakistani Role in Taliban Surge - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2007-01-21 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the ''[[Times of India]]'' called for India to reassess its Taliban threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-03-31/india/28010241_1_pakistan-army-taliban-threat-quetta-shura |title=India forced to reassess Taliban threat |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations and NGOs===
A major issue during the Taliban's reign was its relations with the [[United Nations]] (UN) and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs). Twenty years of continuous warfare had devastated Afghanistan's [[infrastructure]] and economy. There was no running water, little electricity, few telephones, functioning roads or regular energy supplies. Basic necessities like water, food, housing and others were in desperately short supply. In addition, the [[clan]] and family structure that provided Afghans with a social/economic safety net was also badly damaged.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 107&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=126}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan's infant mortality was the highest in the world. A full quarter of all children died before they reached their fifth birthday, a rate several times higher than most other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;
UNCP Country Development Indicators, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

International charitable and/or development organisations ([[NGO]]s) were extremely important to the supply of food, employment, reconstruction, and other services. With one million plus deaths during the years of war, the number of families headed by widows had reached 98,000 by 1998.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2005.00141.x?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=hico Quoting the ICRC].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Taliban restrictions on women were sometime a matter not only of [[human rights]], but of life and death. In Kabul, where vast portions of the city had been devastated from rocket attacks, more than half of its 1.2 million people benefited in some way from NGO activities, even for water to drink.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Afghan Civil War|civil war]] and its never-ending refugee stream continued throughout the Taliban's reign. The Mazar, Herat, and Shomali valley offensives displaced more than three-quarters of a million civilians, using &quot;[[scorched earth]]&quot; tactics to prevent them from supplying the enemy with aid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=64, 78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the aid, the Taliban's attitude toward the UN and NGOs was often one of suspicion, in place of gratitude or even tolerance. The UN operates on the basis of [[international law]], not [[Sharia]], and the UN did not recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. Additionally, most foreign donors and aid workers, were non-Muslims. As the Taliban's Attorney General Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada put it:

&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Let us state what sort of education the UN wants. This is a big infidel policy which gives such obscene freedom to women which would lead to [[adultery]] and herald the destruction of Islam. In any Islamic country where adultery becomes common, that country is destroyed and enters the domination of the infidels because their men become like women and women cannot defend themselves. Anyone who talks to us should do so within Islam's framework. The Holy Koran cannot adjust itself to other people's requirements, people should adjust themselves to the requirements of the Holy Koran.&lt;ref&gt;
Maulvi Jalil-ullah Maulvizada, June 1997 interview with Ahmed Rashid; {{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=111â112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

Taliban decision-makers, particularly Mullah Omar, seldom if ever talked directly to non-Muslim foreigners, so aid providers had to deal with intermediaries whose approvals and agreements were often reversed.&lt;ref name=&quot;rashid 101-102&quot;/&gt; Around September 1997 the heads of three UN agencies in Kandahar were expelled from the country after protesting when a female [[lawyer|attorney]] for the [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] was forced to talk from behind a curtain so her face would not be visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the UN increased the number of Muslim women staff to satisfy Taliban demands, the Taliban then required all female Muslim UN staff traveling to Afghanistan to be chaperoned by a [[mahram]] or a blood relative.&lt;ref name=taliban71&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1998, the Taliban closed &quot;all NGO offices&quot; by force after those organizations refused to move to a bombed-out former [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic]] College as ordered.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/317/7155/369/a Aid agencies pull out of Kabul] The building had neither electricity or running water.&lt;/ref&gt; One month later the UN offices were also shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2000|pp=71â72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As food prices rose and conditions deteriorated, Planning Minister Qari Din Mohammed explained the Taliban's indifference to the loss of humanitarian aid:
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
We Muslims believe God the Almighty will feed everybody one way or another. If the foreign NGOs leave then it is their decision. We have not expelled them.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Agence France-Presse]], &quot;Taliban reject warnings of aid pull-out&quot;, 1998-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;

In 2009 a top U.N official called for talks with Taliban leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/un-official-calls-for-talks-with-taliban-leaders-news-international-jicuarhgaeb.html |title=UN official calls for talks with taliban leaders  |publisher=sify.com |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the U.N lifted sanctions on the Taliban,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7067537/UN-lift-sanctions-on-Taliban-to-build-peace-in-Afghanistan.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=UN: lift sanctions on Taliban to build peace in Afghanistan | first=Ben | last=Farmer | date=January 25, 2010 | accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and requested that Taliban leaders and others be removed from terrorism watch lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/01/25/UN-Reduce-Taliban-names-on-terror-list/UPI-69591264400185/ |title=UN Reduce Taliban names on terror list |publisher=upi.com |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the U.S. and Europe announced support for President Karzai's latest attempt to negotiate peace with the Taliban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/01/2010125185642602982.html |title=Asia News |publisher=english.aljazeera.net |date=January 26, 2010 |accessdate=August 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
