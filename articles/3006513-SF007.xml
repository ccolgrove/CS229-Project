'''Smith Micro Software, Inc.''' (NASDAQ:'''[http://quotes.nasdaq.com/quote.dll?mode=stock&amp;symbol=SMSI&amp;selected=SMSI&amp;page=multi&amp; SMSI]'''), founded in 1983 by WilliamÂ W. Smith,Â Jr., is a diversified developer and marketer of both enterprise and consumer-level software solutions and services. Though headquartered in [[Aliso Viejo, California|Aliso Viejo]], [[California]], Smith Micro maintains multiple domestic and international offices, with [[US]] locations in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] and [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]], California, [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], as well as international locations in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. Recently, the company has shifted focus toward network connection and security technologies, and begun forays into the evolving wireless media industry, as indicated by major partnerships with cellular service providers such as [[Verizon Wireless]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Verizon Wireless Chooses Smith Micro Technology to Support New VZAccess Manager&quot;&gt;[http://www.smithmicro.com/default.tpl?group=news_full&amp;id1=243&amp;id2=13 Verizon Wireless Chooses Smith Micro Technology to Support New VZAccess Manager ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[AT&amp;T]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSBNG27679420071210 Smith Micro to buy PCTEL unit for $59.7 million]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sprint Nextel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestreet.com/newsanalysis/businessnews/10343567.html Smith Micro Bags Sprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate history==

In the company's early days, Smith Micro centralized its product focus on [[dial-up]] [[modem]] and [[fax]] software technology, distributing predominantly to OEM computer software/hardware manufacturers. By the early 90s, the company had  become one of the leading names in its industry niche. With an [[IPO]] in 1995, Smith Micro became publicly traded in the [[NASDAQ]] under the symbol [http://quotes.nasdaq.com/quote.dll?mode=stock&amp;symbol=SMSI&amp;selected=SMSI&amp;page=multi&amp; SMSI]. Initial stock offering values were approx. $12.75 per share.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chdet=1217448000000&amp;chddm=1288736&amp;q=NASDAQ:SMSI&amp; Google Finance Chart: SMSI]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late '90s, dial-up internet access was being replaced by [[broadband]] technology, due to the substantially higher speed and reliability it afforded. This change led Smith Micro to re-apply its network connection expertise to new, wireless and mobile network software. Network connection management became a specialization of the company and, as such, Smith Micro developed products of interest to large-scale [[mobile network operators]] such as [[AT&amp;T]]. While fax and minor modem-related products were still being sold, wireless connection manager technology was the company's primary source of revenue in the early 2000s.

In 2005, Smith Micro moved to expand its consumer product line with the acquisition of [[Allume Systems]] and their [[StuffIt]] data compression software. Shortly after the acquisition of Allume Systems, Smith Micro further expanded its market presence with the purchase of Israel-based image editing company, PhoTags. Following these and other acquisitions ([[e frontier America]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgw.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=Home&amp;type=news&amp;mod=News&amp;mid=9A02E3B96F2A415ABC72CB5F516B4C10&amp;tier=3&amp;nid=EC3FC2FD3A11489887911078A5F2AFAB Smith Micro to Acquire E-Frontier]&lt;/ref&gt; and ([[busineSMS.com Software]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithmicro.com/about/news-press-detail.aspx?newsid=393 Smith Micro Announces The Acquisition Of busineSMS.com Software]&lt;/ref&gt; Smith Micro expanded its overall consumer business presence, though retained a central focus on network and wireless-related products. In early 2008, the company expressed interest in [[WiMAX]] broadband,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithmicro.com/default.tpl?group=news_full&amp;id1=421&amp;id2=13 Smith Micro Teams Up to Maximize WiMAX User Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; a newly developed cellular technology, typically considered to be a [[4G]] wireless protocol, and a candidate for the replacement of current [[3G]] cellular systems.
