'''Aurora SPARC Linux''' is an [[operating system]], based on [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]], for [[SPARC]]-based computers. Aurora was originally created after [[Red Hat]] dropped support for the SPARC architecture after Red Hat Linux 6.2.

The name derives from the internal [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] codename for the SPARCStation 5 chassis.

Since Aurora is derived from Fedora, and most of its developers are located in the US, it only maintains packages legally distributable in the United States.

==Feature==
* Aurora contains special utilities that are specific to the SPARC hardware line, such as audioctl, lssbus, silo.
* While SPARC has supported 64-bit processing since the ULTRA series, the SPARC distribution uses a 32-bit kernel.

== Version history ==
Like Fedora (and Red Hat Linux before that), Aurora names all of its releases.

==Repositories of extra software==

Like Fedora Core, Aurora only includes a core set of packages. For downloading and installing programs or [[codec]]s not distributed with Aurora, there are several [[software repository|repositories]] available.  

=== Official repositories ===
Currently only Aurora Extras has an official status. This repository supports the currently released version of Aurora SPARC Linux Build 2.0. Aurora Extras is maintained by a group of volunteers. As a link to Extras is currently included in the base distribution, no extra configuration is required to enable it.
