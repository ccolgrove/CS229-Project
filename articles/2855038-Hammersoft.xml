'''Joseph Anthony &quot;Joey&quot; Barton''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|dÊ|oÊ|iË|_|Ë|b|É:|t|Én}}; born 2 September 1982) is an [[England|English]] [[association football|footballer]] who plays for and captains [[Premier League]] side [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] as either a [[Midfielder#Centre midfielder|central midfielder]] or a [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]].

Barton was born in [[Huyton]], [[Merseyside]] and raised in a working-class area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joey Barton's damning verdict on football's pampered elite&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.co.uk/sport/football/tm_headline=joey-barton-s-damning-verdict-on-football-s-pampered-elite-&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=18276729&amp;siteid=93463-name_page.html|first=Paul|last=McCarthy|date=2006-12-17 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |title=Joey Barton's damning verdict on football's pampered elite |publisher=''People.co.uk''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his football career with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 2002 after working his way through their youth system. His appearances in the senior side gradually increased over the following five years and he made more than 150 for the club. He earned his first [[Cap (sport)|cap]] for the [[England national football team|England national team]] in February 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;England 0-1 Spain&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6330177.stm |accessdate=2007-07-09 |title=England 0â1 Spain| last=Sinnott |first=John| publisher=BBC Sport | date=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite his criticism of some of the team's players. He then joined Newcastle United for a fee of Â£5.8 million in July 2007. After 4 years with the Magpies, he joined his current club [[Queens Park Rangers]] in August 2011.

His career and life have been marked by numerous controversial incidents and disciplinary problems,&lt;ref name=&quot;4thegameprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4thegame.com/club/newcastle-united-fc/player-profile/3601/joeybarton.html |title=4thegame Profile |work=4thegame.com |accessdate=2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been convicted twice on charges of violence.

== Club career ==
=== Early career ===
Barton pursued his dreams of becoming a professional footballer by joining Everton's youth system, but played for Liverpool when he was 14. He underwent trials at [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], but was rejected when it was decided he was too small to become a footballer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11679_2276165,00.html|first=James|last=Pearson|date=2003-09-14 |accessdate=2007-08-01 |title=Barton reveals Forest rejection |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton said his rejection by clubs only made him more determined to succeed as a footballer and prove his detractors wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton:Toffees snub helped me&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11679_2289148,00.html|first=Paul|last=Higham|date=2004-01-24 |accessdate=2007-08-01 |title=Barton: Toffees snub helped me |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first appearance for the club's under-17s team in 1999 and played regularly at Academy level for three years. His first reserve team appearance came at the end of the [[2000-01 in English football|2000â01 season]], in his final year as a trainee. Uncertain about Barton's future prospects, the club planned to release him,&lt;ref name=&quot;progprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Profile: Joey Barton | work=Manchester City FC vs Wigan Athletic match programme, p19 | date=2006-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but reconsidered and gave him his first professional contract in the close season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;/&gt; Over the next two years, he successfully made the transition from the under-19s to regular reserve football. He was promoted to the first-team squad in the [[2002-03 in English football|2002â03 season]].

=== Manchester City ===
[[Image:Barton leap.jpg|thumb|upright|Joey Barton heading a ball during a match in 2004.]]
Barton would have made his debut for the City first-team in November 2002 against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], had he not lost his shirt after leaving it on the substitutes bench at half-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11679_2250687,00.html |date=2002-11-25 |accessdate=2007-07-18 |title=Things get shirty for City starlet | publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually made his first-team debut for the club against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 5 April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Bailey, [http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/55/55678_barton_lifts_citys_gloom.html &quot;Barton lifts City's gloom&quot;], ''Manchester Evening News'', 7 April 2003, accessed 1 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His first senior goal came two weeks later in a 2-0 win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on [[Good Friday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/2936441.stm |date=2003-04-18 |accessdate=2007-07-12 |title=City cruise past Spurs | publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the [[2002-03 in English football|2002â03 season]] with a run of seven consecutive starts.

After impressing in his first season at City, Barton was offered a new one-year contract at the club by manager [[Kevin Keegan]], which he signed in April 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/2950239.stm |date=2003-09-22 |accessdate=2007-07-10 |title=Barton signs new City deal
 | publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured in the first-team more regularly during the [[2003-04 in English football|2003â04]] season and, following a second Premiership goal, was rewarded with a call-up to the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] squad for their [[2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2004 European Championship]] qualifiers against [[Republic of Macedonia national under-21 football team|Macedonia]] and [[Portugal national under-21 football team|Portugal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Platt sings Barton's praise&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/U21s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/09/64237.htm |date=2003-09-03 |accessdate=2007-07-09 |title=Platt sings Barton's praise | publisher=''TheFA.com''|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050410212050/http://www.thefa.com/England/U21s/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/09/64237.htm |archivedate = April 10, 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[FA Cup]] match against Tottenham saw Barton receive the first [[red card (sports)|red card]] of his career in unusual circumstances: at [[half-time]], with his club 3â0 down, he argued with the referee and was sent off although the match was not in progress. In the second half, despite playing with 10 men, Barton's team-mates achieved an unlikely 4â3 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2004/02/05/1038343.htm |accessdate=2007-07-26 |title=Man City write new chapter in FA Cup lore | publisher=ABC news}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton left the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] in anger on 17 April, after not being named in the team to play [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=452045&amp;in_page_id=1779 |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2007-09-14 |title=Barton's roll of shame | publisher=Daily Mail | location=London |first=Simon |last=Watkins}}&lt;/ref&gt; However he featured regularly in the 2003â04 season, which he completed with 39 appearances and one goal. His displays impressed City's supporters, and at the end of the 2003â04 season he was awarded with the club's Young Player of the Year award.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scrapbook&quot;/&gt;

Barton sparked a ten-man brawl in a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] on 25 July 2004 after &quot;hacking&quot; at an opposition player.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan fury at Barton&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/3923995.stm |date=2004-07-25 |accessdate=2007-07-10 |title=Keegan fury at Barton| publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he signed a new contract on 22 September 2004, which would keep him at City until 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/3679346.stm |date=2004-04-15 |accessdate=2007-07-10 |title=Barton earns new deal

In the summer of 2005, Barton was sent home from a pre-season tournament in [[Thailand]] after assaulting a 15-year-old [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] supporter&lt;ref&gt;Rob Hughes, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/02/07/sports/SOCCER.php &quot;Enigmas of 2 tarnished stars&quot;], ''International Herald Tribune'', 7 February 2006, accessed 17 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; who had provoked Barton by verbally abusing him and kicking his shin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile:Joey Barton&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article550765.ece |date=2005-08-02 |accessdate=2007-07-09 |title=Profile:Joey Barton|first=Jenny|last=Booth|publisher=''Times Online'' | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton had to be restrained from attacking the boy further by teammate [[Richard Dunne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton completes move to Magpies&quot; /&gt; Barton underwent anger management therapy at the order of City manager [[Stuart Pearce]] and paid Â£120,000 in club fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11679_2345065,00.html|first=Paul|last=Higham|date=2005-08-06 |accessdate=2007-08-01 |title=Barton asks for help |publisher=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 2005, Barton began a seven-day programme of behavioural management at the [[Sporting Chance clinic]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Barton: Rebel with an amazing capacity for trouble&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/barton-rebel-with-an-amazing-capacity-for-trouble-767095.html|date=2007-12-28 |accessdate=2007-07-09 |title=Barton: Rebel with an amazing capacity for trouble|first=Sam|last=Wallace|publisher=''The Independent'' | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; a charity set up to help troubled sportsmen and women.

Barton handed in a written transfer request in January 2006, which the club rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/4663950.stm |date=2006-01-30 |accessdate=2007-07-09 |title=Man City reject request by Barton | publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, they also rejected a verbal offer for Barton from [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/4667892.stm |date=2006-01-31 |accessdate=2007-07-09 |title=Man City reject Boro's Barton bid | publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Stuart Pearce]] asserting that a deal could still be made to keep him at the club.

[[Image:Joey Barton corner.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Barton taking a corner in 2010.]]
In his first appearance in over three months on 3 May 2009, Barton was sent off late in a 3â0 loss to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield]] for a sliding challenge on [[Xabi Alonso]]. The red card ruled Barton out of Newcastle's remaining three games of the season, with the club in danger of relegation from the Premier League. Newcastle manager [[Alan Shearer]] raised doubts about Barton's future at the club, saying &quot;I think it would be wrong to discuss his future now, but I'm not very happy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8031815.stm|title=Barton 'stupidity' riles Shearer|publisher=BBC Sport| date=3 May 2009| accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 May, Newcastle United announced the suspension of Barton indefinitely, and Barton was told to stay away from the club. As a result, Barton's future at Newcastle United was put in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/8033495.stm|title=Barton hit by Magpies suspension |publisher=BBC Sport| date=5 May 2009| accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club suspension was widely reportedly to have resulted not directly from the red card, but from a dressing room confrontation with Shearer and assistant manager [[Iain Dowie]] following the game. Shearer said he made a mistake putting Barton back into the team, and that his tackle was &quot;a coward's tackle&quot;, to which Barton replied that he was &quot;the best player at the club&quot;, and Shearer had to play him. Shearer said that Barton wasn't, that he was &quot;shit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2009/05/05/1247140/report-joey-barton-blasts-newcastle-united-manager-alan-shearer|title=Joey Barton Blasts Newcastle United Manager Alan Shearer|publisher=Goal.com| date=5 May 2009| accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton replied that Shearer was &quot;a shit manager with shit tactics&quot;.

Barton stayed on with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] after they were relegated to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], playing six out of Newcastle's opening eight league games, but suffered an injury to his foot in a 3â1 win against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] on 19 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2557/news/2010/03/16/1835776/newcastle-united-midfielder-joey-barton-steps-up-his | work=Goal | title=Newcastle United midfielder Joey Barton steps up his comeback from injury | date=16 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned in April for Newcastle, playing all nine of Newcastle's remaining league fixtures and scoring his only goal of the campaign from a free kick in a win over [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8572945.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doncaster 0 - 1 Newcastle | date=23 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the form of [[Danny Guthrie]] and [[Kevin Nolan]], Barton had to play left wing when he returned.

He started his new club season 2010â2011 as a first team regular, playing against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on the opening day. On Barton's and Newcastle's second game, he scored against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in a 6â0 victory for Newcastle. Immediately, after the game Barton removed a moustache which he had pledged to not shave until Newcastle United had won a game in the new season. On 10 November, in a 2â1 defeat to Blackburn, Barton again acted violently, punching [[Morten Gamst Pedersen]] in the chest.

== International career ==
Barton represented the [[England national under-21 football team|England U21]] and was part of the squad for their [[2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2004 European Under-21 Championship]] qualifiers against [[Republic of Macedonia national under-21 football team|Macedonia]] and [[Portugal national under-21 football team|Portugal]], scoring once against Portugal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platt sings Barton's praise&quot;/&gt;
