'''Paramount''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]].  According to the 2010 census, the city had a total population of 54,098 down from 55,266 at the 2000 census.  Paramount is part of the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]]; and is bordered by [[Compton, California|Compton]] and [[Lynwood, California|Lynwood]] to the west, [[South Gate, California|South Gate]] and [[Downey, California|Downey]] to the north, [[Bellflower, California|Bellflower]] to the east and south, and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] to the south.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Paramount has a total area of {{convert|4.8|sqmi|km2}}.  {{convert|4.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (2.28%) is water.

==History==
The city today known as Paramount was originally identified in 1781 by Spanish settlers of [[New Spain]]. It was organized under two old [[Ranchos of California|Spanish Ranchos]]; on the west, [[Rancho San Pedro]], and on the east, [[Rancho Los Nietos]] (now portions of the cities of [[Santa Fe Springs, California|Santa Fe Springs]] and [[Whittier, California|Whittier]]). These ranchos were established under the [[Spanish Empire]] and granted by [[King Carlos III]] in 1784. In 1834, Rancho Los Nietos was partitioned into five smaller ranchos including [[Rancho Los Cerritos]] and [[Rancho Los Alamitos]], which both encompased parts of Paramount.

After the [[Mexican-American War]] California was ceded to the United States.  The then-unincorporated community of Paramount was created in 1948 when the United States Postmaster General ordered the merger of the post offices of Hynes and Clearwater (Pitt 1997:381). The name was taken from Paramount Boulevard, the main north-to-south surface street extending through the city. The city officially incorporated January 30, 1957 following a successful &quot;Save Paramount for Paramount&quot; campaign to fight annexation by Long Beach, Bellflower, and South Gate.

While the Paramount economy was based largely on the hay and dairy industries, the high cost of land led to their local demise. The last Paramount dairy closed in 1977.

The '''Paramount Hay Tree''' is a California State Historical Landmark. It is a still standing mature camphor tree remembered for its importance to the hay trading marketplace of the towns of Hynes and Clearwater, which later incorporated as Paramount. The hay traders met under the tree each working day to discuss the price of hay. Their numbers were quoted by the New York mercantile markets as the global hay standard.
