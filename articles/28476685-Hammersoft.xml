'''Tatra T 810''' is a medium truck made by Czech company [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]. Unlike other Tatra trucks, it doesn't use the traditional [[Tatra (company)#Tatra concept|Tatra conception]] of [[backbone chassis]] and swinging half-axles, but the customary truck architecture with [[Ladder_frame#Ladder_Frame|conventional frame]].

In early 1990s the [[Czech Army]] was aiming to replace its aging fleet of medium trucks, which was represented by the [[Praga (company)|Praga]] [[V3S]] model introduced into production as early as in 1953. The selection procedure was won the ''RoudnickÃ© slÃ©vÃ¡rny a strojÃ­rny'' (''Foundries And Machine-Works of Roudnice'') with  its [[ROSS R210]] project. The R210 was outsourcing many components from [[Renault Trucks|Renault]]. Since 1996 the company delivered 15 vehicles for the testing purposes, after which the delivery of serial vehicles was supposed to start, however in 1998 the Czech Army canceled the contract. The company has invested a lot into the development of the truck and subsequently it bankrupted.&lt;ref name=&quot;IDNES&quot;&gt;{{cs icon}} {{cite web

In 2002 the Tatra company bought the documentation and rights to the R210 truck in order to enter the market of medium trucks (from 3,5 tons to 12 tons), as all the models the company offered were in the class of heavy trucks. It intended to modernize the original project, and it also hoped that the Czech Army will finally undertake the replacement of its fleet of 4000 Praga V3s (while Tatra was supplying the Army with heavy trucks since World War I). Tatra closed alliance with other companies to work on the project together; for example the Praga was supposed to deliver gear boxes and [[portal axle]]. Other components were to be delivered by Renault (engine, cab).&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatra N2&quot;&gt;{{cs icon}} {{cite web

In 2005 the Czech government approved acquisition of the T810 trucks in August 2005, while deliveries were scheduled to start in April 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Army&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The civilian version of T810 was introduced in 2010, with Tatra claiming it is the only truck with maximum weight of 15,5 tons that has three driven axles, which together with its [[portal axle|portal architecture]] is supposed to give it advantage over the competition in terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatra N2&quot;&gt;{{cs icon}} {{cite web
