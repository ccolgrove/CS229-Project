'''Jean-Pascal Mignot''' (born 26 February 1981 in [[Rouen]]) is a [[France|French]] [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as [[Defender (football)|defender]] for [[AS Saint-Ãtienne]] in the French [[Ligue 1]].

He made the international sporting headlines on 21 October 2010 when he was the first player in the history of the [[UEFA Champions League]] to be sent-off/dismissed without ever actually taking to the field.

The incident occurred during a group stage match against [[AFC Ajax]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]]. Mignot was warming up on the touchline during the closing moments of the game, and strongly remonstrated against a decision made by the referee, [[Olegario Benquerenca]]â. The official strode across to Mignot and produced a yellow card, followed swiftly by a red card, after Mignot had continued to speak out of turn.
