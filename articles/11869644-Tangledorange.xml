'''Zuccotti Park''', formerly called '''Liberty Plaza Park''', is a {{convert|33000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}  publicly accessible park in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]].  It is a [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/priv/priv.shtml Privately-Owned-Public-Space] (POPS) controlled by [[Brookfield Properties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nycdcp&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work=New York City Department of City Planning | title= Privately Owned Public Space | url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/priv/mndist1.shtml | accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park was created in 1968 by [[Pittsburgh]]-based [[United States Steel]], after the property owners negotiated its creation with city officials, and named Liberty Plaza Park and situated beside [[One Liberty Plaza]]. It is located between [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]], [[Trinity Place (New York City)|Trinity Place]], [[Liberty Street (Manhattan)|Liberty Street]] and [[Cedar Street (Manhattan)|Cedar Street]]. The park's northwest corner is across the street from [[Four World Trade Center]]. It has been popular with local tourists and financial workers.

The park was heavily damaged in the [[September 11 attacks]] and subsequent recovery efforts of 2001. The plaza was later used as the site of several events commemorating the anniversary of the attacks. After renovations in 2006, the park was renamed by its current owners, [[Brookfield Office Properties]], after company chairman [[John E. Zuccotti|John Zuccotti]].

In 2011, the plaza became the site of the [[Occupy Wall Street]] [[protest camp]]. During the demonstration, activists were [[occupation (protest)|occupying]] the plaza and using it as a staging ground for protests throughout the Manhattan [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].

==History==
===Creation and early background===
The park, formerly called Liberty Plaza Park, was created in 1968 by Pittsburgh based United States Steel in return for a height bonus for an adjacent building at the time of its construction. That building is now known as [[One Liberty Plaza]].&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bpc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Liberty Plaza Construction to Begin this Spring | url=http://wirednewyork.com/forum/showthread.php?t=4476&amp;page=1 | work=Battery Park City Broadsheet | date=Jan 21, 2004 | accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was one of the few open spaces with tables and seats in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. Located one block from the [[World Trade Center]], it was covered with debris, and was subsequently used as a staging area for the recovery efforts after the [[September 11th attacks|destruction]] of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookfield Press Release&quot;/&gt; As part of the Lower Manhattan rebuilding efforts, the park was regraded, trees were planted, and the tables and seating restored.&lt;ref name=&quot;bpc&quot;/&gt;

===Post-September 11 reconstruction ===
On June 1, 2006, the park reopened after an $8 million renovation designed by [[Cooper, Robertson &amp; Partners]]. It was renamed Zuccotti Park in honor of [[John E. Zuccotti]], former City Planning Commission chairman and first deputy mayor under [[Abe Beame]] and now the chairman of Brookfield Properties,&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt; which used private money to renovate the park. Currently, the park has a wide variety of trees, granite sidewalks, tables and seats, as well as lights built into the ground, which illuminate the area. 

A sculpture of a seated businessman, ''Double Check'', was removed during the reconstruction period, but was returned in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;LMDC-2006-06-01&quot;/&gt; It was joined by ''Joie de Vivre'', a 70-foot-tall abstract sculpture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genocchio&quot;/&gt;

[[File:WTM by official-ly cool 030.JPG|thumb|left|275px|Zuccotti Park is home to two sculptures, including [[Mark di Suvero]]'s ''Joie de Vivre'', seen here]]

With its proximity to Ground Zero, Zuccotti Park is a popular tourist destination. The [[World Trade Center cross]], which was previously housed at [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, New York|St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church]], was featured in a ceremony held in Zuccotti Park before it was moved to the the 9/11 Memorial.&lt;ref name=&quot;LMDC-2011-07-23&quot;/&gt;

===Sculptures===
The park is home to two sculptures: ''Joie de Vivre'' by [[Mark di Suvero]] and ''Double Check'', a bronze businessman sitting on a bench, by [[John Seward Johnson II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LMDC-2006-06-01&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LMDC-2005-07-25&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brookfield Press Release&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunlap&quot;/&gt;

''Joie de Vivre'', a 70-foot-tall sculpture consisting of bright-red beams, was installed in Zuccotti Park in 2006, having been moved from its previous installation in the [[Storm King Art Center]]. [[Benjamin Genocchio]], an Australian art critic, commented that the sculpture suited the location, &quot;nicely echoing the skyscrapers around it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Genocchio&quot;/&gt;

===Occupy Wall Street=== 
{{Main|Occupy Wall Street}}
On September 17, 2011, the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; protest began using Zuccotti Park as a campground and staging area for their actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moynihan 9/19&quot;/&gt; Some of the protesters displayed a placard welcoming visitors to &quot;Liberty Park&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Moynihan&quot;/&gt; an informal return to a version of the park's original name. The organizers had originally planned to occupy [[One Chase Manhattan Plaza]], but the plaza was closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pepitone&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Occupy Wall Street Crowd Size 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|297px|Beginning on September 17, 2011, Zuccotti Park was [[Occupation (protest)|occupied]] by protesters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scola&quot;/&gt;]] 

Because Zuccotti Park is not a publicly owned space, it is not subject to ordinary public park curfew. New York City Police Commissioner [[Raymond Kelly]] said on September 28, 2011, that the [[NYPD]] could not bar protesters from Zuccotti Park since it is a public plaza that is required to stay open 24 hours a day. &quot;In building this plaza, there was an agreement it be open 24 hours a day,&quot; Kelly said. &quot;The owners have put out regulations [about what's allowed in park]. The owners will have to come in and direct people not to do certain things.&quot; A spokesperson for Brookfield Properties, the owner of the park, expressed concern: &quot;Zuccotti Park is intended for the use and enjoyment of the general public for passive recreation. We are extremely concerned with the conditions that have been created by those currently occupying the park and are actively working with the City of New York to address these conditions and restore the park to its intended purpose.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fractenberg&quot;/&gt;

On October 6, 2011, it was reported that Brookfield Office Properties, which owns Zuccotti Park, had issued a statement which said, &quot;[[Sanitation]] is a growing concern ... Normally the park is cleaned and inspected every weeknight... because the protestors refuse to cooperate ... the park has not been cleaned since Friday, September 16th and as a result, sanitary conditions have reached unacceptable levels.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot;/&gt; To protect and clean the park, protesters volunteered to sweep the areas of the plaza and posted signs urging each other to avoid damaging the flower beds.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS Local&quot;/&gt;

Starting at roughly 1 a.m. local time on November 15, NYPD began clearing Zucotti Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=James | last=Barron | first2=Colin | last2=Moynihan | authorlink=James Barron (journalist) | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/nyregion/police-begin-clearing-zuccotti-park-of-protesters.html | title=Police Begin Clearing Zuccotti Park of Protester | work=The New York Times | date=November 14, 2011 | accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/us/new-york-occupy-eviction/index.html | title=Police move in to evict Occupy protesters from New York park | work=CNN | date=November 15, 2011 | accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a court order was released allowing them to return,&lt;ref name=&quot;Supreme Court of the State of New York County of the New York&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/266582-order-re-liberty-park/|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; police refused to allow them back in. Later that day, the New York Supreme Court that issued the injunction ruled against allowing protesters to camp or sleep in Zuccotti Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK NEW YORK COUNTY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Matter of the Application of JENNIFER WALLER et al.|url=http://www.courts.state.ny.us/press/OWS111511.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
