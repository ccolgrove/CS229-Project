'''Lycos Europe''' was a [[pan-European]] network of websites, offering services including communication tools, [[online communities]], [[web search]], [[e-commerce]], [[web hosting]], [[homepage]] building and [[Internet access]]. It was an independent corporation, sharing no corporate structure with [[Lycos|Lycos, Inc. (USA)]] other than the licensed use of their name in Europe, but Lycos Europe was formed as a joint-venture between [[Bertelsmann]] and [[Telefonica]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://crenk.com/lycos-europe-to-close-its-doors-is-this-first-step-to-tech-company-closures/ Lycos Europe To Close Its Doors. Is This First Step to Tech Company Closures?] Crenk.com 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;, who owned Lycos Inc. through [[Terra Lycos]]. On 26 November 2008, Lycos Europe announced that it was to shut down and sell its remaining assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paidcontent.co.uk/entry/419-lycos-europe-to-shut-down-after-failing-to-find-buyer/ Lycos Europe To Shut Down After Failing To Find Buyer] Robert Andrews.

==The Winding up of Lycos Europe==
In November 2008, Lycos Europe announced that shareholders had called for its liquidation.  Over the following months, it sold as many of its assets as possible and liquidated.  Sold assets included the sale of the Danish portal [[Jubii]], the Lycos Chat - [[worldsbiggestchat]] (which at the time was both the Lycos &amp; [[Yahoo]] Chat in Europe) was transferred to the new operator [[Noesis Systems Ltd]], on March 9, 2009 and later rebranded as the [[Noesis Chat]], Love@Lycos was sold to a Swedish company. Lycos Europe sold further businesses: the news search Paperball was taken over by Paperball GmbH, Munich. The search engine Fireball now belongs to Ambrosia AG, Zug (Switzerland). Trademark and domains of the French Email-Service Caramail were taken over by [[United Internet]] AG, Montabaur. Conversis hosting GmbH continues the free hosting service MultiMania. Since liquidation, Lycos Inc withdrew the right for Lycos Europe to use their name and therefore, Lycos Europe are still partially trading under the name Jubii Europe.

==Make Love Not Spam==
In November 2004, Lycos Europe introduced a [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS]] [[screensaver]] program called ''Make Love Not Spam''. It was introduced as both marketing for the then-new Lycos email service Spray Mail, and as a way for users to fight [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] in a collective manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4051553.stm Screensaver tackles spam websites] [[BBC News Online]]. 29 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The program worked using users' computers to perform a [[DDOS]] attack on the [[web servers]] of known spammers. The computers worked in the same way as a [[botnet]] except the users were aware of the software and were able to decide if they wished to be involved in the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4061375.stm Anti-spam plan overwhelms sites] [[BBC News Online]]. 2 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On the December 21, 2004 Lycos Europe stopped distributing the program whilst simultaneously 'turning off' the programs on computers that had downloaded it. The decision was made under heavy criticism from internet and security experts. It is also believed Lycos were subject to large scale counterattacks believed to be from spammers in retaliation.  The distribution website was replaced with the words &quot;Stay Tuned&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4073547.stm Anti-spam screensaver scrapped] [[BBC News Online]]. 6 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
