'''OpenOffice.org Writer''' is the [[word processor]] component of the [[OpenOffice.org]] [[Software package (installation)|software package]]. Writer is a word processor similar to [[Microsoft Word]] and Corel's [[WordPerfect]], with some of their features.

As with the entire OpenOffice.org suite, Writer can be used across a variety of platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Irix]] and [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]]. Released under the terms of the [[GNU Lesser General Public Licence]], Writer is [[free software]].

== Features ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Writer is capable of opening and saving documents in a number of formats, including the OASIS [[OpenDocument|Open Document Format 1.1]] (its default format), [[Microsoft Word]]'s [[.DOC|DOC]], [[DOCX]], [[Rich Text Format|RTF]] and [[XHTML]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

Writer provides a number of features not present in Word out of the box, including a [[word completion]] mechanism for predictive writing that is not available in Microsoft Word as of September, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.  It has ability to export to the [[PDF]] format natively similar to that in [[Microsoft Office 2010]] and  [[Microsoft Word 2007]] .

Features include&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentation.openoffice.org/manuals/userguide3/0201WG3-IntroducingWriter.pdf Openoffice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Templates and styles
* Page-layout methods, including frames, columns, and tables
* Embedding or linking of graphics, spreadsheets, and other objects
* Built-in drawing tools
* Master documentsâto group a collection of documents into a single document
* Change tracking during revisions
* Database integration, including a bibliography database

* MailMerge&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentation.openoffice.org/manuals/userguide3/0211WG3-UsingMailMerge.pdf Openoffice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Equation editor ([[OpenOffice.org Math]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://documentation.openoffice.org/manuals/userguide3/0216WG3-MathObjects.pdf Openoffice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scriptable and Remote Controllable via the [[Universal Network Objects|UNO API]]

== Limitations ==
{{Prose|date=April 2011}}

* Grammar checking requires the installation of an extension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oooninja.com/2009/01/openofficeorg-31-new-features.html New Features in OpenOffice.org 3.1, an Early Look]&lt;/ref&gt; Document templates are also available as extensions for OpenOffice.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/dictionaries Openoffice.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Writer lacks a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;draft view&quot; found in most other word processors, where paper margins and some aspects of the layout are hidden in order to let the user focus on text editing rather than layout. This is one of the most voted for feature requests on the OpenOffice web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4914 |title = Issue 4914 - &quot;normal&quot; view option needed |date=2002-05-15 |publisher = [[OpenOffice.org]] |accessdate = 2009-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Cannot have a single document viewable in a split window view (either horizontally or vertically split), whereby you can view two different locations in the document at once (for comparison, editing, copy or cut and paste operations, etc.).

* Cannot open multiple documents in one task window (either horizontally or vertically split, or tiled with one another) and keep each document visible at the same time (for comparison, editing, copy or cut and paste operations, ''et al.'') rather than having only a single document viewable at a time.

* Its outline numbering options (outline level designations or labeling, degree of indenting) are not nearly as flexible as other word processors such as Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect, nor customizable.
