It might refers to a [[Myth and ritual|Myth]], commonly known in Northeastern Argentine fables where the Guaranitic cultural influence is greater; a folk Song which treats the legend itself embedding it in a song, and a bird on which existence had inspired the fable through aboriginals ancestors.

==The Myth==

The '''Carau''' is further referred to an old and sorrowful legend from the Northeast of [[Argentina]], fable about a young men whose mother suffering a deadly disease sent him to go for medicament to the village. Her son, an innocent young boy that within the way to the village, hearing an accordion in the distance  and following its thread, ran into a ''concurrence'' (a northeastern folk-country party) where forgot his medicament mission.

Then got dancing with the prettiest girl of the zone. Later, amidst dancing, a Carau's comrade hindered him about a notice, telling: &quot;I beg your pardon Carau my friend, my condolences your mother just died...&quot;

responding: &quot;don't matter my friend mum already died, then I'll have time to cry...&quot;

Later in the night when the dawn was coming, he asked the lady for going together to her house, and continued with coldness she responds: &quot;My house is far away from here, and I won't be visited for some who don't care his own motherâ¦&quot;

Afterwards, saying goodbye, with the heart utterly broke, moving to home imbibed in tears, the young Carau was transformed into a bird and ''tupa'' (god) condemned him to bear mourning black feathers and crying forever, just like the bird lament: ''carÃ¡u''.

==The Song==
This legend, was embedded in a song which was written by Emilio Chamorro, a regional folk writer, and had commonly been sung in ''[[chamamÃ©]]'' style; it gathered wide spread through greater northeastern folk singers as Zitto Zegovia and Mario Boffil in their versions of &quot;El CarÃ¡u&quot;.
