'''Internet Explorer for UNIX''' was a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[graphical user interface|graphical]] [[web browser]] that was available free of charge and produced by [[Microsoft]] for use in the [[X Window System]] on [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] or [[HP-UX]]. Development ended with a version of [[Internet Explorer 5]] in 2001 and support for it was completely discontinued in 2002.

==Development history==
In MayÂ 1996, it was reported that Steven Guggenheimer confirmed that they were looking into porting Internet Explorer to run on UNIX-like platforms, but were looking into how exactly it should be done.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.petting-zoo.net&quot;&gt;[http://www.petting-zoo.net/~deadbeef/archive/1291.html Microsoft leans toward a Unix platform version of its Internet Explorer browser] - Dana Gardner writing for [[InfoWorld]] Electric (May 29, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  It was further reported that [[Steve Ballmer]], then executive vice president of Microsoft, had shown an interest earlier in the month for a Microsoft browser to run on Unix as part of the strategy to wage the [[browser wars]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In pursuit of a larger share of the mammoth browser market, Microsoft has been dealing with [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] and [[Computer workstation|workstation]] makers to have its IE browser [[Product bundling|bundled]] with newly shipping [[Computer hardware|hardware]]. Ballmer hinted, however, that not having a Unix browser was posing an obstacle to this [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]-based strategy to try and catch up with No.Â 1 browser maker [[Netscape Communications Corp.]], which holds some 85Â percent of the worldwide [[Web browser|browser]] market with its [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]] product line. &quot;We might just have to get one of those&quot;, Ballmer said of a Unix-based browser.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.petting-zoo.net&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In June, Microsoft entered into a contract with  [[Bristol Technology Inc.]] to develop a version of Bristol's porting [[Application software|application]] [http://web.archive.org/web/20071012220327/http://www.bristol.com/windu/ Wind/U (archived)] to port IE for Windows to Unix.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ctd.uscourts.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.ctd.uscourts.gov/Opinions/110300.JCH.Bristol3.pdf Bristol Technology v. Microsoft] - ruling by Janet C. Hall, Connecticut District Court judge (November 3, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Bristol also had a contract with Microsoft allowing it access to Windows source code from SeptemberÂ 1994 to SeptemberÂ 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ctd.uscourts.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www.techlawjournal.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.techlawjournal.com/courts/bristol/Default.htm Tech Law Journal: Bristol Technology v. Microsoft] - article from Tech Law Journal (February 21, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The project was officially announced by Microsoft at the end of JulyÂ 1996 that a native version of IE for &quot;Solaris and other popular variants of UNIX&quot; would be finished by the end of the year, which would have &quot;equivalent functionality as that provided in Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0&quot;, thus &quot;delivering on its commitment to provide full-featured Web browser support on all major operating system platforms&quot; as well as &quot;supporting and promoting open standards, including [[HTML]], [[ActiveX]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.microsoft.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/jul96/crosspltpr.mspx Best-of-Breed Browsers for Multiple Platforms] - press release from Microsoft (JulyÂ 29,Â 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following a dispute in MarchÂ 1997 concering each other's performance and because of contract negotiations with Bristol to access Windows source code after SeptemberÂ 1997 failing,&lt;ref name=&quot;www.techlawjournal.com&quot;&gt;as previously&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;techlawjournal.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.techlawjournal.com/atr/80930bri.htm Microsoft Files Opposition to Bristol's Motion for Preliminary Injunction] - article from Tech Law Journal (September 30, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft reversed course and decided to directly port the Windows version in-house using the [http://www.mainsoft.com/products/mainwin.aspx MainWin] XDE (eXtended Development Environment) application from [[Mainsoft]],&lt;ref name=&quot;mainsoft.com-1998&quot;&gt;[http://www.mainsoft.com/news/press_releases/1998_3_04_01.aspx Microsoft launches Internet Explorer on Unix] - press release from Mainsoft (MarchÂ 4,Â 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; the main competitor to Bristol Technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ctd.uscourts.gov&quot;/&gt; (Microsoft would later also use MainWin to port [[Windows Media Player]] and [[Outlook Express]] to Unix.&lt;ref name=&quot;mainsoft.com-2000&quot;&gt;[http://www.mainsoft.com/news/press_releases/2000_8_14_01.aspx Microsoft to port Internet Explorer technologies to Unix] - press release from Mainsoft (August 14, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;) Now well behind schedule, the 3.0 branch was apparently scrapped in favor of 4.0 (that was released for Windows half a year earlier), which used the new [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident rendering engine]]. A [[Development stage|beta]] of the Solaris version was made available on NovemberÂ 5,Â 1997,&lt;ref name=&quot;sunsite.uakom.sk&quot;&gt;[http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-11-1997/swol-11-ie4.html Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 for Solaris] ([http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-11-1997/images/ie-unix.gif Screenshot]) - Robert McMillan writing for SunWorld (November 5, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; with a final version expected by MarchÂ 1998.

Tod Nielsen, general manager of Microsoft's developer relations group, jokingly declared that he wanted to hold the launch of the browser at the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe It or Not]] museum in [[San Francisco]] due to the skepticism by those who believed the project was [[vaporware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;www.infoworld.com&quot;&gt;[http://replay.web.archive.org/19990829191129/http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980127.wiieunix.htm Microsoft says Unix browser is on schedule] - Bob Trott writing for InfoWorld Electric (January 27, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; It was further reported that versions for [[HP-UX]], [[AIX operating system|IBM AIX]], and [[Irix]] were planned&lt;ref name=&quot;www.infoworld.com&quot;/&gt; (note that at the time MainWin XDE 3.0 was only available for the &quot;Solaris [[SPARC]] 2.51 platform&quot;, but MainWin XDE 2.1 was &quot;available on Solaris SPARC 2.51, Solaris Intel 5.5.1, [[SunOS]] 4.1.4, Irix 5.3, Irix 6.2, HP UX 10.2 and IBM AIX 4.1.5&quot;.)&lt;ref name=&quot;mainsoft.com-1998&quot;/&gt; IE 4.0 for Unix on Solaris was released on MarchÂ 4,Â 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;mainsoft.com-1998&quot; /&gt; Later that year a version for HP-UX was released.

* MarchÂ 5,Â 1998: Microsoft reached a settlement with Bristol which &quot;provided mutual releases for any claims arising out of the IE Agreement&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.ctd.uscourts.gov&quot;/&gt;

* [[1999]] IE 5.0 for Unix on Solaris and HP-UX released.

* [[2001]] IE 5.0 for Unix Service PackÂ 1 released for Solaris and HP-UX.

==Versions==
There are nine versions officially listed by Microsoft:&lt;ref name=&quot;support.microsoft.com&quot;&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969393/en-us KB969393] - Help and Support page on Microsoft's website (August 17, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

* 4.01 40-bit on Solaris
* 4.01 40-bit on HP-UX
* 4.01 128-bit on Solaris
* 4.01 128-bit on HP-UX
* 5.0 40-bit on Solaris
* 5.0 40-bit on HP-UX
* 5.0 128-bit on Solaris
* 5.0 128-bit on HP-UX
* 5.0 SP1 Beta 128-bit on Solaris

However, [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.microsoft.com/unix/ie/default.asp archived copies of Microsoft's IE for UNIX website] indicate that Service Pack 1 was released (presumably in finished form) for both Solaris and HP-UX.&lt;ref name=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20020802053023/http://www.microsoft.com/unix/ie/default.asp Internet Explorer for UNIX Home Page] - old version of webpage (&quot;Last Updated: October 29, 2001&quot;) from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not known why Microsoft omitted references to these from its official list; Microsoft only hosted 128-bit encryption SP1 patches, so it is likely that there are three other versions as well:

* 5.0 SP1 Beta 128-bit on HP-UX
* 5.0 SP1 128-bit on Solaris
* 5.0 SP1 128-bit on HP-UX

* &quot;Internet Explorer 5 for UNIX supports most of the features and technologies of Internet Explorer for Windows, but also differs in some respects.  For example, Internet Explorer for UNIX does not support downloadable ActiveX controls or browsing and organizing your local files and folders within the browser window.  Other unsupported features include filters/transitions in CSS, the DHTML Editing component, and HTML Applications (HTAs). [...] Internet Explorer for UNIX offers some features not found on the Windows version as well, such as Emacs-style keyboard shortcuts and external program associations.&quot;

* Microsoft had a [[newsgroup]] named &quot;microsoft.public.inetexplorer.unix&quot; on its public [[news server]] msnews.microsoft.com

* &quot;The [[User agent|User Agent]] String for Internet Explorer 5 is static except for the third field which depends on the Operating System and the processor you are using. Here are some common configurations and the user agent strings generated by Internet Explorer on these platforms:&quot;

==Disappearance==

The homepage for IE for Unix was removed from Microsoft's website in the third quarter of 2002 without explanation, replaced with the message: &quot;We sincerely apologize, but Internet Explorer technologies for UNIX are no longer available for download.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;microsoft.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/unix/ie/default.asp Internet Explorer for UNIX Home Page] - current (&quot;no longer available&quot;) version of webpage&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted however, that while the homepage had been removed, the actual download page remained up for a time.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.mozillazine.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=2477 Internet Explorer for UNIX Discontinued] - article from [[MozillaZine]] (SeptemberÂ 19,Â 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given by Microsoft's [[Public relations|PR firm]] was that &quot;low customer demand for this download did not justify the resources required for continued development&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.extremetech.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,3973,587342,00.asp Who killed IE for Unix?] - Jim Lynch writing for ExtremeTech (OctoberÂ 3,Â 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
