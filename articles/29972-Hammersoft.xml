[[Image:KrÃ¤utertee.jpg|thumb|Herbal tea]]
A '''herbal tea''', '''tisane''', or '''ptisan''' is a [[herb]]al or plant [[infusion]] and usually not made from the leaves of the [[tea]] bush (''[[Camellia sinensis]]''). Typically, herbal tea is simply the combination of boiling water and dried fruits, flowers or herbs. Herbal tea has been imbibed for nearly as long as written history extends. Documents have been recovered dating back to as early as Ancient Egypt and Ancient China that discuss the enjoyment and uses of herbal tea. Among Chinese, herbal tea is commonly known as ''liong cha'' ([[Cantonese]]) or ''liang cha'' ([[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]).

==Etymology==
The [[English language|English]] word &quot;tisane&quot; originates from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word ÏÏÎ¹ÏÎ¬Î½Î· (ptisanÄ), a drink made from [[pearl barley]]. The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] term ''liang cha'' åè¶, means cooling tea, and the Chinese used to drink it to cool down the body when it was overheated due to weather or sickness.

==Composition==
Herbal teas can be made with fresh or dried flowers, leaves, seeds or roots, generally by pouring boiling water over the plant parts and letting them steep for a few minutes. Seeds and roots can also be boiled on a stove. The tisane is then strained, sweetened if so desired, and served. Many companies produce herbal [[tea bag]]s for such infusions.

Flavored [[tea]]s are prepared by adding other plants to an actual tea ([[Black tea|black]], [[Oolong tea|oolong]], [[Green tea|green]], [[Yellow tea|yellow]], or [[white tea]]); for example, the popular [[Earl Grey tea]] is black tea with [[bergamot orange|bergamot]] (the orange oil, not the herb of the same name), jasmine tea is Chinese tea with [[jasmine]] flowers, and [[genmaicha]] is a Japanese green tea with toasted rice.

== Medicinal concerns ==
Herbal teas are often consumed for their physical or medicinal effects, especially for their [[stimulant]], [[Muscle relaxant|relaxant]] or [[sedative]] properties. The medicinal effects of certain herbs are discussed under [[herbalism]]. The medicinal benefits of specific herbs are often anecdotal or controversial, and in some countries (including the United States) makers of herbal teas are not allowed to make unsubstantiated claims about the medicinal effects of their products.

While most herbal teas are safe for regular consumption, some herbs have [[toxin|toxic]] or [[allergy|allergenic]] effects. Among the greatest causes of concern are:

* [[Comfrey]], which contains [[alkaloids]] that can cause permanent [[liver]] damage with chronic use.
* [[Lobelia]], which contains [[toxins]] similar in effect to [[nicotine]].

Herbal teas can also have different effects from person to person, and this is further compounded by the problem of potential misidentification. The deadly [[foxglove]], for example, can be mistaken for the much more benign (but still relatively toxic to the liver) [[comfrey]].

The UK does not require herb teas to have any evidence concerning their efficacy, but does treat them technically as food products and require that they are safe for consumption.

Most of the ingredients used in Indian herbal teas are non-toxic in nature. However, according to Naithani &amp; Kakkar (2004), &quot;all herbal preparations should be checked for toxic chemical residues to allay consumer fears of exposure to known neuro-toxicant pesticides and to aid in promoting global acceptance of these products&quot;.&lt;ref name=NaithaniKakkar2004&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16268119 | year = 2004 | last1 = Naithani | first1 = V | last2 = Kakkar | first2 = P | title = An evaluation of residual organochlorine pesticides in popular Indian herbal teas | volume = 59 | issue = 8 | pages = 426â30 | doi = 10.3200/AEOH.59.8.426-430 | journal = Archives of environmental health }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the source of the herbal ingredients, teas may be contaminated with pesticides or heavy metals.&lt;ref name=NaithaniKakkar2004 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16228893 | year = 2005 | last1 = Naithani | first1 = V | last2 = Kakkar | first2 = P | title = Evaluation of heavy metals in Indian herbal teas | volume = 75 | issue = 1 | pages = 197â203 | doi = 10.1007/s00128-005-0738-4 | journal = Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antioxidant properties ==
Available as pure or blended samples, herbal teas are popular because of their fragrance, antioxidant properties and therapeutic applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.foodres.2005.07.004 | title = Decline in antioxidant capacity of Indian herbal teas during storage and its relation to phenolic content | year = 2006 | last1 = Naithani | first1 = V | last2 = Nair | first2 = S | last3 = Kakkar | first3 = P | journal = Food Research International | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 176â181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.foodchem.2006.08.032 | title = Antioxidative and anti-hydrogen peroxide activities of various herbal teas | year = 2007 | last1 = Aoshima | first1 = H | last2 = Hirata | first2 = S | last3 = Ayabe | first3 = S | journal = Food Chemistry | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 617â622}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The antioxidant properties (AOP) of herbal teas from temperate plants of mainly Lamiaceae have been well-studied while those of tropical herbal teas are less well-studied. Recently, a comparative study showed that tropical herbal teas were more diverse in types and more variable in AOP values than temperate herbal teas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jfca.2009.10.002 | title = Antioxidant properties of tropical and temperate herbal teas | year = 2010 | last1 = Chan | first1 = E.W.C. | last2 = Lim | first2 = Y.Y. | last3 = Chong | first3 = K.L. | last4 = Tan | first4 = J.B.L. | last5 = Wong | first5 = S.K. | journal = Journal of Food Composition and Analysis | volume = 23 | issue = 2 | pages = 185â189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbal teas generally had lower antioxidant values than teas of ''Camellia sinensis''. Exceptions were lemon myrtle, guava, and oregano teas with AOP comparable to black teas. Mint and peppermint teas had significantly stronger ferrous ion chelating ability than teas of ''C. sinensis''.

==Popularity==
===Countries===
In [[Egypt]], herbal teas such as [[karkade]] are very popular. They are served in [[teahouse|ahwas]].

In [[China]], Tradional Chinese Medicine approach is used in formulating natural herbal teas and they are very popular in enhancing health and addressing core issues within the body; e.g. formulated recipes like hawthorn plus [[oolong]] / [[Pu-erh tea|pu-er]] can address the high fat level in body's bloodstream.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In [[Sri Lanka]], herbal teas have a long history within the local tradition of indigenous medicine. Iramusu ([[Smilax regelii]]), Beli ([[Bael]]), Ranawara ([[Senna auriculata]]), Polpala ([[Aerva lanata]]), weniwel (Coscinium Fenestratum), and kothala-himbutu (Salacia Reticulata) are among the many plant species used to make herbal teas, which are used to treat a wide variety of ailments. The widely used &quot;Paspanguwa&quot; (translated as five-portions) is a common local remedy for colds and fever containing the five ingredients Pathpadagam ([[Mollugo cerviana]]), Katuwelbatu ([[Solanum]] Virginianum), Koththamalli ([[Coriander]] seed), Thippili ([[Long pepper]]), and Inguru ([[Ginger]]), often served with a sweetener of sugar or [[Jaggery]]. Many of these traditional teas are now available in tea-bag form for convenience.&lt;ref&gt;http://serendib.btoptions.lk/article.php?artid=398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2004/05/09/fea11.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
In [[Agatha Christie]]'s [[Hercule Poirot|Poirot]] series of books, Poirot often has a tisane and accounts this as being the reason why his &quot;leetle grey cells&quot; are superior to others.{{cn|date=December 2011}}
