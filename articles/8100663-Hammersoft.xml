The '''1958 LSU Tigers segregated football team''' represented [[Louisiana State University]] during the [[1958 college football season]].  Under head coach [[Paul Dietzel]], the Tigers cruised to an undefeated season capped by a win over [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] (another segregated team) in the [[1959 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]].  LSU was named the [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national champion]] in both the [[AP Poll]] and the [[Coaches' Poll]] PRIOR to their 7-0 Sugar Bowl victory over Clemson.  It was the first recognized national championship for LSU in the poll era. Iowa (integrated team) was awarded the National Championship trophy by the Football Writers Association of America AFTER winning the Rose Bowl 38-12 against California (another integrated team). 

The LSU team was led by [[Billy Cannon]], who won the [[Heisman Trophy]] the [[1959 LSU Tigers football team|following season]].  The team is also remembered for its unique defensive scheme, of which the &quot;Chinese Bandits&quot; were a part.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.couleenews.com/articles/2008/09/26/thisjustin/09cracism.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roster==
LSU coach Paul Dietzel split his team into three groups to minimize fatigue. In addition, the roster consisted only of white players as did their opponents. This was common south of the Mason-Dixon line and east of the Mississippi. In 1958, LSU refused to play teams that included non-whites. Most teams above the Mason-Dixon line and west of the Mississippi were integrated. 

White Team practice squad consisted of Billy Hendrix, Lynn LeBlanc, Larry Kahlden,Max Fugler,Ed McCreedy, Bo Strange,Mickey Mangham,Warren Rabb,
Billy Cannon,Johnny Robinson,Red Brodnax

Go Team consistend of Scott McClain, Dave McCarty, Al Dampier, Bobby Greenwood, Mike Stupka, Jack Frayer,Don Norwood, Durel Matherne,Don Purvis,Donnie Daye, Tommy Davis

Chinese Bandits consisted of Andy Bourgeois, Carroll Bergeron, Mel Branch, Emile Fournet, John Langan, Tommy Lott, Duane Leopard, Gaynell Kinchen,Darryl Jenkins, Henry Lee Roberts, Hart Bourque, Merle Schexnaildre

==Shared National Championship with Iowa==

The University of Iowa was awarded the Grantland Rice trophy in 1958 by the Football Wriers Association of America (FWAA).  The FWAA judged Iowa to be the 1958 National Champions. However, 1958 was also the first year that the AP and Coaches polls were thought to also determine the National Championship. At best, this is a shared title between Iowa and LSU. At worst, this shows that their were two separate champions. LSU among the segregated south. And IOWA for the integrated north.
