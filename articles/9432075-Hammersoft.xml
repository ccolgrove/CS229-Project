The '''''Guitar Hero''''' series (sometimes referred to as the '''''Hero''''' series)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/the-ticket/2009/11/game-review-band-hero.html | title=Game review: Band Hero | work=The Mirror | date=2009-11-06 | accessdate=2009-12-06 | first=Kevin | last=Lynch}}&lt;/ref&gt; is&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE - the series hasn't disappeared off the face of the earth, it simply won't be developed any longer --&gt; a series of [[music video game]]s first published in 2005 by [[RedOctane]] and [[Harmonix Music Systems]], and distributed by [[Activision]], in which players use a [[guitar]]-shaped [[game controller]] to simulate playing [[lead guitar|lead]], [[bass guitar]], and [[rhythm guitar]] across numerous [[rock music]] songs. Players match notes that scroll on-screen to colored [[fret]] buttons on the controller, [[strum]]ming the controller in time to the music in order to score points, and keep the virtual audience excited.  The games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar, including the use of fast-fingering [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s and the use of the [[whammy bar]] to alter the pitch of notes. Most games support single player modes, typically a Career mode to play through all the songs in the game, and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes.

With the introduction of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' in 2008, the game includes support for a four-player band including vocals and drums. The series initially used mostly [[cover version]] of songs created by [[WaveGroup Sound]], but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully [[master recording]]s, and in some cases, special re-recordings, of the songs. Later titles in the series feature support for [[downloadable content]] in the form of new songs.

In 2005, RedOctane, a company specializing in the manufacture of unique game controllers, was inspired to create ''Guitar Hero'' based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for [[Konami]]'s ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'' [[arcade game]]. They enlisted [[Harmonix Music Systems]], who previously developed several music video games, for development assistance. The first game in the series was made on a budget of [[USD|$]]1 million. The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by [[Activision]] in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by MTV Games and went on to create the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series of music games in the same vein as ''Guitar Hero''. Activision brought [[Neversoft]] (primarily known for their [[Tony Hawk (series)|''Tony Hawk'' series of skateboarding games]]) on board for future development duties. Additional companies, such as [[Vicarious Visions]], [[Budcat Creations]], Machineworks Northwest, and [[Aspyr Media]] have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems.

The series currently has seven major releases and four expansions on [[video game console|gaming consoles]]. There are spin-offs for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] systems, mobile phones, the [[Nintendo DS]], and an arcade game. The ''Guitar Hero'' franchise was a primary brand during the emergence of the popularity of rhythm games as a cultural phenomenon in North America. Such games have been utilized as a learning and development tool for medical purposes. The first game in the series was considered by several journalists to be one of the most influential video games of the first decade of the 21st century. The series has sold more than 25 million units worldwide, earning [[United States dollar|US$]]2 billion at retail, claimed by Activision to be the 3rd largest game franchise after the ''[[Mario (series)|Mario]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL]]'' franchises; the third main title of the series, ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' is also claimed by Activision to be the first single video game title to exceed $1 billion in sales. Despite early success, the series, along with the overall rhythm game genre, suffered from poor sales starting in 2009, and in early February 2011, Activision disbanded further development of the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/#!5756232/activision-just-killed-guitar-hero-and-true-crime | title=Activision Just Killed Guitar Hero And True Crime | work=Kotaku | date=2011-09-02 | accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; though later clarified that the series is on hiatus for 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;cvg hiatus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/297719/news/guitar-hero-on-hiatus-for-now-activision/ | title = Guitar Hero 'on hiatus' for now - Activision | publisher = [[Computer And Video Games]] | date = 2011-04-12 | accessdate = 2011-04-12 | first = Tom | last = Ivan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Guitar Hero logo.svg|thumb|right|The original ''Guitar Hero'' logo features more pointed decorations on its letters, emphasizing its basis in [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. The new logo, which was introduced with ''Guitar Hero 5'', removes these sharp features so as to reflect the broader selection of music now included in the games.]]
''Guitar Hero'' was created from a partnership between [[RedOctane]], then their own company that produced specialized gaming controllers, and [[Harmonix Music Systems]], a [[music video game]] development company who had previously produced ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'', ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'' and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]''. RedOctane was seeking to bring in a ''[[GuitarFreaks]]''-like game, highly popular at the time in Japan, into the Western markets, and approached Harmonix about helping them to develop a music game around a guitar controller. Both companies agreed to it, and went on to produce ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;screech&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://media.www.dailyiowan.com/media/storage/paper599/news/2007/08/30/80Hours/While.Their.Guitars.Gently.Screech-2943258.shtml|title=While their guitars gently screech |publisher=[[The Daily Iowan]]|date=2007-08-30|author=Johnson, Brent }}{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was highly successful, leading to the development of its successful sequel ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' in 2006. While initial controllers for the first ''Guitar Hero'' game were designed and built by the Honeybee Corporation of China, subsequent iterations and future controllers were developed inhouse at [[RedOctane]], with development led primarily by [[Jack McCauley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/tag/jack-mccauley/ | first=Jim | last=Stevens | publisher=[[Mercury News]] | date=2008-10-16 | accessdate=2010-09-22 | title=More guitar hero world tour tidbits}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both RedOctane and Harmonix experienced changes in 2006. RedOctane was bought by [[Activision]] in Juneâwho spent [[USD|US$]]100 million to acquire the ''Guitar Hero'' franchise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/Entertainment/article/571744 | first=Marc | last=Saltzman | publisher=[[Toronto Star]] | date=2009-01-17 | accessdate=2009-01-17 | title=Guitar Hero investment pays off}}&lt;/ref&gt;âwhile it was announced in October that Harmonix would be purchased by [[MTV Networks]]. As a result of the two purchases, Harmonix would no longer develop future games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series. Instead, that responsibility would go to [[Neversoft]], a subsidiary of Activision known for developing the [[Tony Hawk (series)|''Tony Hawk's'' series]] of [[skateboarding]] games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-164089.html|title=Next venue for 'Guitar Hero III': PCs, Macs |publisher=[[ZDNet]]|date=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neversoft was chosen to helm the ''Guitar Hero'' series after Neversoft founder, Joel Jewett, admitted to the RedOctane founders, Kai and Charles Huang, that his development team for ''[[Tony Hawk's Project 8]]'' went to work on weekends just to play ''Guitar Hero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-07-24|url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=598|title=How Neversoft Took Over Guitar Hero |publisher=[[Shacknews]]|date=2007-09-26|author=Faylor, Chris }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activision CEO Bobby Kotick believed that Neversoft would help them bring great games to the series, but on reflection, state that had Activision explored Harmonix further as a continued developer for the series, things &quot;may have turned out differently&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27299/DICE_2010_Kotick_Talks_Passion_For_Industry_Debuts_Indie_Contest.php | title=DICE 2010: Kotick Talks Passion For Industry, Debuts Indie Contest | first=Simon | last=Carless | date=2010-02-18 | accessdate=2010-02-19 | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Activision began seeking other markets for the game; a [[Nintendo DS]] version of the series was developed by [[Vicarious Visions]], while a [[Guitar Hero Mobile series|''Guitar Hero Mobile'' series]] was created for [[mobile phones]]. The company also began considering the expansion of the series to band-specific titles with ''[[Guitar Hero: Aerosmith]]''. Later, in November 2008, Activision acquired [[Budcat Creations]], another development studio that had helped with the PlayStation 2 versions of ''Guitar Hero III'' and ''World Tour'', announcing that they will be helping to develop another game in the ''Guitar Hero'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/55821 | title=Activision Buys Guitar Hero PS2 Developer Budcat, Working on 'New Guitar Hero Game' | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-11-10 | accessdate=2008-11-10 | first=Chris | last=Faylor }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Harmonix and MTV Games released a new music title through rival publisher [[Electronic Arts]], called ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]''. It expanded upon the gameplay popularized by the ''Guitar Hero'' series by adding [[drum kit|drum]] and [[microphone]] instruments, allowing players to simulate playing songs as bands. Activision followed suit with the release of ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' in 2008, which supported multiple instruments. In 2009, Activision tripled its ''Guitar Hero'' offerings, and in addition to further continuation of the existing main series with ''[[Guitar Hero 5]]'' and expansions, they introduced the titles ''[[Band Hero]]'', geared towards more family-friendly [[pop music]], and ''[[DJ Hero]]'', a game based on [[turntablism]] and featuring a number of [[DJ mix|mixes]]. With the release of ''Guitar Hero 5'', Activision has considered the series to move away from its heavy metal basis into a more rounded selection of music. ''Guitar Hero 5'' is the first game in the series to use a new version of the series' logo. Previous logos for games used a font with sharper &quot;points&quot; on the letters, which was considered &quot;idiosyncratic with a vengeance&quot; to match the emphasis on heavy metal music that the previous games had. Activision used the services of the [[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram]] design studio to refashion the game's logo. Pentagram developed a new font, removing some of the &quot;aggressive odd&quot; features to make the typeface more suitable and amendable to design feature incorporation to other games such as ''Band Hero'' and ''DJ Hero''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pentagram.com/en/new/2009/09/new-work-guitar-hero-1.php | title=New Work: Guitar Hero | publisher=[[Pentagram (design studio)|Pentagram]] | date=2009-09-01 | accessdate=2009-09-03 | first=Michael | last=Bierut }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.offworld.com/2009/09/type-heroes-pentagram-takes-yo.html | title=Type Heroes: Pentagram takes you behind the font of Guitar Hero | publisher=[[Offworld]] | first=Brandon | last=Boyer | date=2009-09-03 | accessdate=2009-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the expanded offerings did not contribute well to the series, alongside the [[late-2000s recession]]; sales of most rhythm games including ''Guitar Hero'' and ''DJ Hero'' did not meet expectations, falling about 50% short of projected targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25712 | title = Analyst: Mixed September NPD Means More Choppy Waters Ahead For Industry | publisher =[[Gamasutra]] | first= Leigh | last = Alexander | date = 2009-10-20 | accessdate =2009-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/89407-Guitar-Hero-Gets-Greatest-Hits | title = Guitar Hero Gets &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; | first = Logan | last = Fredrick | date = 2009-02-12 | accessdate = 2009-02-16 | publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;computerandvideogames1&quot; /&gt; Activision announced it would be cutting back to only 10 [[stock-keeping unit|SKU]]s within 2010 instead of the 25 in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;vg247 2010 skus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2010/02/10/actibliz-full-year-financials-2009-60-million-guitar-hero-songs-download/ | title = Acti Bliz slashes music SKUs, 60 million Guitar Hero songs downloaded | first = Stephany | last = Nunneley | publisher = [[VG247]] | date = 2010-02-10 | accessdate = 2010-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though RedOctane and Neversoft continued to develop the 6th main game, ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock]]'', until its completion, both studios were since shuttered by Activision, moving key personnel into Activision directly for future game development, and in the case of Neversoft, closing its ''Guitar Hero'' division, while transferring future development duties for the series to Vicarious Visions, another Activision studio which has been fundamental in building the Wii and Nintendo DS versions of the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;1up&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3177918 | title = Activision Confirms Studio Layoffs | first=  Steve | last = Watts | date = 2010-02-11 | accessdate = 2010-02-11 | publisher = [[1UP.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Activision also closed [[Budcat Creations]], the arm of the publisher that was primarily responsible for porting the ''Guitar Hero'' games to the PlayStation 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/31573/Report_Activision_Closes_Guitar_Hero_Band_Hero_CoDev_Budcat_Creations.php | title = Report: Activision Closes Guitar Hero, Band Hero Co-Dev Budcat | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = 2010-11-16 | accessdate= 2010-11-16 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main titles===
[[Image: Guitar Hero series controllers.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The controllers bundled with ''Guitar Hero'' releases (from left to right): [[Gibson SG]]s for ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' (PlayStation 2) and [[Gibson Explorer]] for ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' (Xbox 360) and ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' (PC)]]
The original ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' was released on the [[PlayStation 2]] in November 2005. ''Guitar Hero'' is notable because it comes packaged with a controller peripheral modeled after a black [[Gibson SG]] guitar. Rather than a typical [[gamepad]], this guitar controller is the primary input for the game. Playing the game with the guitar controller simulates playing an actual guitar, except it uses five colored &quot;fret buttons&quot; and a &quot;[[strum]] bar&quot; instead of [[fret]]s and strings. The development of ''Guitar Hero'' was inspired by [[Konami]]'s ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'' arcade game, which at the time, had not seen much exposure in the North American market; RedOctane, already selling guitar-shaped controllers for imported copies of GuitarFreaks, approached Harmonix about creating a game to use an entirely new Guitar controller. The concept was to have the gameplay of ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'' with the visuals of ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'', both of which had been developed by Harmonix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Simons|2007|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Simons|2007|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;simons&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2801/book_excerpt_inside_game_design_.php | title=Book Excerpt: Inside Game Design: Harmonix Music Systems | publisher=Gamasutra | first=Iain | last=Simons | date=2007-12-05 | accessdate=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;edge interview LoPiccolo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/harmonix-interview | title=Harmonix Interview | publisher=''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' | date=2008-10-20 | accessdate=2008-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was met with critical acclaim and received numerous awards for its innovative guitar peripheral and its soundtrack, which comprised 47 playable [[rock music|rock]] songs (most of which were [[cover version]]s of popular songs from artists and bands from the 1960s through modern rock). ''Guitar Hero'' has sold nearly 1.5 million copies to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/magazine/15-10/mf_harmonix?currentPage=2 | title=Full-On Rock Band Makes Jamming Follow-Up to ''Guitar Hero'' | publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' | first=Chris | last=Kohler | date=2007-09-14 | accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the series increased dramatically with the release of ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'' for the PlayStation 2 in 2006. Featuring improved multiplayer gameplay, an improved note-recognizing system, and 64 songs, it became the fifth best-selling video game of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3156365|title=NPD Releases December Numbers, Fanboys Riot|publisher=[[1UP.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation 2 version of the game was offered both separately and in a bundle with a cherry red Gibson SG guitar controller. ''Guitar Hero II'' was later released for the [[Xbox 360]] in April 2007 with an exclusive [[Gibson Explorer]] guitar controller and an additional 10 songs, among other features. About 3 million units of ''Guitar Hero II'' have sold on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/fashion/15guitar.html|title=Virtual Frets, Actual Sweat: The New Karaoke|publisher=The New York Times|last=Zezima|first=K.|date=2007-07-14|accessdate=2008-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' was released in late 2007 for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Wii]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Mac OS X]] platforms. The title is the first installment of the series to include wireless guitars bundled with the game and also the first to release a special bundle with two guitars.  The game includes [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Tom Morello]] as playable characters in addition to the existing fictional avatars; both guitarists performed motion capture to be used for their characters' animation in the game.

''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'', previously named ''Guitar Hero IV'', is the fourth full game in the series and was released on October 26, 2008 for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

It is the last game in the series developed by Neversoft's ''Guitar Hero'' division prior to its dissolution, with Vicarious Visions assisting on the Wii version with added Nintendo DS functionality.

''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]'' for the PlayStation 2, which was released in July 2007, was the final game developed by Harmonix for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/01/12/new-egm-reveals-guitar-hero-1980s-edition-ps2/|title=New EGM reveals ''Guitar Hero'' : 1980s Edition (PS2)|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it was produced after Harmonix were purchased by MTV Games, it was part of their contractual obligation to complete the game. The game, as suggested by its name, features tracks primarily from the 1980s.

Expert+ mode was implemented to allow faster bass pedal beats, fast to the point where it would normally be out of the playable range of a single bass pedal, and was intended for a dual bass pedal.

''[[Guitar Hero Smash Hits]]'' (titled ''Guitar Hero: Greatest Hits'' in Europe and Australia) was released in June 2009. It features full-band versions of 48 songs from earlier ''Guitar Hero'' games that only used the guitar controller.

''[[DJ Hero]]'' was announced by Activision in May 2009.

The game includes a peripheral, dubbed the &quot;Guitar Grip&quot;, a rectangular device that fits into the second slot of the Nintendo DS or DS Lite.  The peripheral only features the first four fret buttons and a strap so the Nintendo DS can be held sideways comfortably for play. The game also includes a [[guitar pick]] shaped [[stylus (computing)|stylus]] for use with strumming in the game, which players move across the touchscreen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign reveal&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/860/860511p1.html | title=Exclusive Reveal: ''Guitar Hero DS'' | publisher=IGN | date=2008-03-13 | last=Harris | first=Craig | accessdate=2008-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guitar Hero: On Tour'' was developed by [[Vicarious Visions]], who also ported the ''Guitar Hero'' games to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] console.

''Band Hero'' has also been ported to the Nintendo DS by Vicarious Visions, expanding the play to include vocals (through the DS microphone) and drumming. The drumming uses a special &quot;drum skin&quot; adapter designed for the [[Nintendo DS Lite]] to map the units face buttons to four drum pads, however this ''drum skin'' is not compatible with the original Nintendo DS model or the Nintendo DSi. However, since the Drum's skin is not electronic but a rubber cover switch that duplicates certain buttons on the DS Lite, a player can press certain buttons in time to play the drums. The game includes four-player local wireless play in a similar manner as ''Guitar Hero 5'' allowing any combination of instruments to be used. The game has a set of 30 songs; some are from the ''Band Hero'' and others are from several Guitar Hero games set lists.

''Guitar Hero: On Tour'' does not work on the [[Nintendo DSi]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]] because unlike the Nintendo DS, they do not have Game Boy Advance slots. ''Band Hero'' is limited to vocals and drums for the same reason.

Activision and [[Konami]], who had previously worked together to make sure that the ''Guitar Hero'' series meets with Konami's patents on music games, developed an [[arcade game|arcade console]] version of the game, titled ''Guitar Hero Arcade'', distributed to arcades in early 2009.  The game is completely based on the ''Guitar Hero III'' gameplay, but reducing some of the features such as the use of the Whammy bar, Star Power Button (Star Power may only be activated by lifting the Guitar) and Practice Modes, but keeping the ability to download new songs for the cabinet from the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2008/12/08/guitar-hero-arcade-based-on-guitar-hero-3/ | title='Guitar Hero Arcade' Is Based On 'GH III,' Developer Explains Konami's Surprising Involvement | first=Patrick | last=Klepek | date=2008-12-08 | accessdate=2008-12-08 | publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arcade game has come under some scrutiny by the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP), who believe the use of the game in arcades is equivalent to &quot;public performances&quot; and seek additional fees to be paid by operators of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2009/12/ascap_wants_licensing_fees_fro.php | title=ASCAP Wants Licensing Fees From Guitar Hero Arcade Operator | first=Eric | last=Caroli | date=2009-12-21 | accessdate=2009-12-21 | publisher=[[Game Set Watch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ''Guitar Hero'' products that were announced but never released were a [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]-themed title&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3179088&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[PlayStation Portable]] title that would have featured a drum component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6210427/starcraft-ii-by-end-of-2009-call-of-duty-expanding-to-new-genres | title=Starcraft II byend of 2009, Call of Duty expanding to new genres | publisher=[[Gamespot]] | first=Brendan | last=Sinclair | date=2009-06-01 | accessdate=2009-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Guitarhero-screen.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Gameplay of a single player playing Pantera's &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot;&lt;!--the notes on the screenshot are recognizably this song's opening riff in the Hard difficulty--&gt;. The player in ''Guitar Hero'' must play the colored notes on the fret board in time with the music as they scroll through the target at the bottom. The score and current score multiplier are shown on the bottom left. The Rock Meter dial and Star Power indicator are shown on the bottom right. The remainder of the screen shows the player's character and band as they perform to the music.]]
The core gameplay of the ''Guitar Hero'' games is a [[music video game|rhythm game]] similar to [[Konami]]'s ''[[GuitarFreaks]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;simons&quot; /&gt; and to a lesser extent [[Harmonix Music Systems|Harmonix]]'s previous music games such as ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'' and ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]''. The guitar controller is recommended for play, although a standard console controller can be used instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=[[BradyGames]]|title=Guitar Hero II Official Strategy Guide|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|year=2006|isbn=0744008549|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0744008549/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh2&quot;&gt;{{cite video game|title=Guitar Hero II|developer=[[Harmonix Music Systems]]|publisher=[[RedOctane]]|date=2006-11-07|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the guitar controller has been required for play ever since the inclusion of drum and vocal parts in the series. The game supports toggling the [[handedness]] of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh2&quot; /&gt; 

While playing the game, an extended guitar neck is shown vertically on the screen (the [[fret]]s horizontal), often called the &quot;note highway&quot;, and as the song progresses, colored markers or &quot;gems&quot; indicating notes travel down the screen in time with the music; the note colors and positions match those of the five fret keys on the guitar controller. Once the note(s) reach the bottom, the player must play the indicated note(s) by holding down the correct fret button(s) and hitting the strumming bar in order to score points. Success or failure will cause the on-screen Rock Meter to change, showing how well the player is playing (denoted by red, yellow, and green sections). Should the Rock Meter drop below the red section, the song will automatically end, with the player booed off the stage by the audience. Successful note hits will add to the player's score, and by hitting a long series of consecutive successful note hits, the player can increase their score multiplier. There is a window of time for hitting each note, similar to other rhythm games such as ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', but unlike these games, scoring in ''Guitar Hero'' is not affected by accuracy; as long as the note is hit within that window, the player receives the same number of points.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh2&quot; /&gt;

Selected special segments of the song will have glowing notes outlined by stars: successfully hitting all notes in this series will fill the &quot;Star Power Meter&quot;. The Star Power Meter can also be filled by using the [[tremolo arm|whammy bar]] during sustained notes within these segments. Once the Star Power Meter is at least half full, the player can activate &quot;Star Power&quot; by pressing the select button or momentarily lifting the guitar into a vertical position. When Star Power is activated, the scoring multiplier is doubled until Star Power is depleted. The Rock Meter also increases more dramatically when Star Power is activated, making it easier for the player to make the Rock Meter stay at a high level. Thus, Star Power can be used strategically to play difficult sections of a song that otherwise might cause the player to fail.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh2&quot; /&gt; In the earlier entries of the series (up until ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith''), activating Star Power meant that players could not accrue more Star Power until the Star Power meter was fully drained and the effect ended. Starting with ''Guitar Hero: World Tour'', more Star Power can be collected even if the effect is active by completing more Star Power phrases, extending the Star Power's duration by doing so. When playing in cooperative play (with a bassist/rhythm guitarist in ''Guitar Hero II'' through ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'' or as a band in ''Guitar Hero: World Tour''), Star Power is shared between all the players and activation of Star Power is dependent on all players simultaneously activating it.

Notes can be a single note, or composed of two to five notes that make a [[guitar chord|chord]]. Both single notes and chords can also be sustained, indicated by a colored line following the note marker; the player can hold the sustained note(s) keys down for the entire length for additional points. During a sustained note, a player may use the whammy bar on the guitar to alter the tone of the note. Also, regardless of whether sustains are hit early or late, if the fret is held for the full duration of the hold, the game will always award the same amount of score increase for the note. In addition, the games support virtual implementations of &quot;[[hammer-on]]s&quot; and &quot;[[pull-off]]s&quot;, guitar-playing techniques that are used to successfully play a fast series of notes by only changing the fingering on the fret buttons without having to strum each note. Sequences where strumming is not required are indicated on-screen by notes with a white outline at the top of the marker instead of the usual black one, with ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' adding a white-glowing effect to make these notes clearer.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh2&quot; /&gt;  ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' features transparent notes that are connected by a purple outline; players may either simply tap the correct fret for these notes without strumming or utilize a touchpad on ''World Tour''{{'}}s guitar controller to mimic the [[slide (guitar technique)|slide technique]]. In addition, notes can now be played while a sustained note is being played. ''World Tour'' also adds an open string note for bass players, represented by a line across the fret instead of any note gems, that is played by strumming without holding down any fret buttons (the sixth installment, ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]'', features an open note sustain for bass instruments as well).

''Guitar Hero World Tour'' introduced drums and vocal tracks in addition to lead and bass guitar.  Drum tracks are played similar to guitar tracks; the player must strike the appropriate drum head or step down on the bass drum pedal on the controller when the note gems pass the indicated line.  Certain note gems, when using a drum controller that is velocity-sensitive, are &quot;armored&quot;, requiring the player to hit the indicated drum pad harder to score more points.  Vocal tracks are played similar to games such as ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'' where the player must match the pitch and the pacing of the lyrics to score points. ''Guitar Hero 5'' allows players to create a band of up to four players using any combination of instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;gh5 preview&quot;/&gt;

While the song is playing, the background visuals feature the players' chosen [[avatar (computing)|avatar]], along with the rest of the band performing in one of several real and fictional venues. The reaction of the audience is based on the performance of the player judged by the Rock Meter. ''Guitar Hero II'' added special lighting and other stage effects that were synchronized to the music to provide a more complete concert experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh2&quot; /&gt; The games developed by Neversoft feature a simple storyline, usually about a band's quest for fame, which is told through animations played throughout the game. These animations were created by [[Chris Prynoski]] and his studio, Titmouse, Inc., who have also done animations for the animated show ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://games.ign.com/articles/963/963887p1.html | title=Titmouse Opens Game Studio | publisher=IGN | date=2009-03-19 | accessdate=2009-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game modes===
[[Image:Guitar-hero-3-gameplay.jpg|thumb|225px|right|In ''Guitar Hero III''{{'}}s two-player &quot;Battle Mode&quot;, each player attempts to interfere with their opponent's performance using special power-ups while avoiding being distracted by those thrown by the opponent.]]
The main mode of play in the ''Guitar Hero'' games is Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional performance arenas and perform sets of four to six songs. It is by completing songs in this mode that the songs are unlocked for play across the rest of the game. Players can choose their on-stage character, their guitar of choice, and the venue they wish to play in. In this mode, the player can earn money from his/her performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus songs, additional guitars and finishes, your characters clothing and bonus content can be unlocked. Quick Play mode is a quicker method of playing songs, as it allows the player to select a track and difficulty, selecting the character, venue, and guitar and guitar skin for the player based on the song chosen. After successfully completing a song, the player is given a score, a percentage of how many notes they hit and a rating from three to five stars, and two in rare cases depending on his/her final score on the song, with money being awarded in ''Guitar Hero World Tour''.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh2&quot; /&gt;

The games have also added multiplayer modes.  Cooperative modes allow two players to play lead and either bass or rhythm guitar on the same song, working together towards the same score.  A competitive Face-Off mode allows two players to play against each other at different difficulty levels, each attempting to earn the best score on a song. Each player plays different portions of the song. There is also a Pro Face-Off mode, where two players battle at the same difficulty level. Unlike standard Face-off, each player attempts to play all of the notes in a song, while still trying to earn the highest score. In ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' this was advanced on, as players could play a Pro Face-Off game against each other on any difficulty level, the lower your difficulty, the more points were awarded so a player on a low difficulty could potentially beat a player on a more challenging difficulty. ''Guitar Hero III'' introduced Boss Battles, in which two players face off against each other, attempt to collect &quot;distractions&quot; to throw at their opponent, trying to make them fail.  With ''Guitar Hero World Tour'', up to four players can play cooperatively on lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals, while a total of eight players can compete in a Battle of the Bands.  The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii versions of the games support multiplayer modes over their respective network services.

The four difficulty levels for each song afford the player a learning curve in order to help him/her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces the fourth (blue) fret button, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. The addition of the orange fret button forces players to move their fingers up and down the neck. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player and to simulate the player's hands to move in a sequence similar to a real guitar. A difficulty added in ''World Tour'' is Beginner, which only requires the player to strum to the basic rhythm; holding the fret buttons becomes unnecessary.&lt;ref name=&quot;strategy guide&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gh2&quot; /&gt; Another new difficulty only for drums was added to ''Metallica'' known as Expert+, which uses the double bass pedal.

''Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock'' is the sixth installment in the franchise and introduced a new take on the Career mode of previous games. Rather than being a quest for fame and glory with the band travelling through different venues, ''Warriors of Rock'' features the &quot;Quest Mode&quot; as the primary campaign mode. Quest Mode tells the story of an ancient warrior who was defeated by a powerful monster and his mystical guitar was lost. The player must amass a team of rockers to help recover this guitar and defeat the monster (called &quot;The Beast&quot;). As the player progresses through the mode, the rockers joining them will transform based on the number of stars earned from songs played. These transformations will empower the player with extra abilities in a song such as constant score multipliers or Star Power bonuses. These abilities are each unique to the individual rockers and by using them effectively, it is possible now to earn up to forty stars for a single song.

===Characters and customization===
When playing through Career mode or in other parts of the ''Guitar Hero'' games, the player has the option to select one of several pre-created avatar characters, who will be shown performing on stage as the player attempts a song, but otherwise has no effect on the gameplay.  A certain number of characters are available at the start of the game, but the player must spend in-game money earned by successful performances to unlock other characters.  Many of the characters reappear throughout the series, with the character roster changing as new characters are added or removed. Standby characters that have appeared in nearly all the games include the [[Heavy Metal Subculture|metalhead]] Axel Steel, extreme/viking/thrash metalhead Lars Ãmlaut, punk rocker Johnny Napalm, alternative rocker Judy Nails, and hard rocker Casey Lynch. The developers utilized these characters in more detail within ''Warriors of Rock'', where each was given a unique setlist and venue based on their musical style, as well as a unique power within the game's Quest mode.

Several games in the series feature caricatures of celebrity artists, such as [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[Tom Morello]] and [[Bret Michaels]]  in ''Guitar Hero III'', [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] in ''World Tour'', [[Kurt Cobain]] in ''Guitar Hero 5'', and [[Taylor Swift]] and the band [[No Doubt]] in ''Band Hero''. The band-specific games, ''Aerosmith'', ''Metallica'', and ''Van Halen'' also feature the members of the respective bands. However, in late 2009, both [[Courtney Love]] and the members of No Doubt sought legal action against Activision for the misuse of their in-game characters singing or performing songs by other artists, which the musicians believe fell outside of their contract.

The ability for the players to create their own avatars was added in ''Guitar Hero World Tour'', and was based on Neversoft's existing character creation tools from the ''Tony Hawk'' series. Later games on the Xbox 360 and Wii allowed players to use the respective console's avatars as members of the band. In addition to unlocking characters, in-game money can be used to buy clothing, accessories and instruments that they are seen playing with.  The guitars can also be customized with special finishes purchasable through the in-game store.  ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' includes the ability to fully customize any component of the guitar.  The in-game store in the series is also used to unlock bonus songs or special videos with interviews about the game or with the artists involved.

===Soundtracks===
Most of the games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series feature a selection of songs ranging from the 1960s to present day [[rock music]] from both highly successful artists and bands and independent groups.  ''Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s'' features songs primarily from the 80s, while  ''Guitar Hero: Aerosmith,'' ''Metallica,'' and ''Van Halen'' feature music from the respective bands and groups that inspired or worked with the bands. Songs with profanities have been censored.

Many of the ''Guitar Hero'' games developed for the recent generation of consoles (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii) support [[downloadable content]], allowing players to purchase new songs to play in the respective titles.  Songs each cost approximately [[USD|$]]2 through the various online stores for the console's platform.  Prior to ''Guitar Hero 5'', downloadable content for earlier games will not work in other games in the series, save for songs from [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Death Magnetic]]'', which were available for ''Guitar Hero III'', ''World Tour'', and ''Metallica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5046652/metallicas-new-album-hits-guitar-hero-friday | title=Metallica's New Album Hits Guitar Hero Friday | publisher=Kotaku | first=Brian | last=Crecente | date=2008-09-08 | accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing ''World Tour'' downloadable content for ''World Tour'' will be forward-compatible with ''Guitar Hero 5'',''Band Hero''&lt;ref name=&quot;gh5 preview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58645 | title=First Guitar Hero 5 Songs Include Johnny Cash; Compatibility with GH World Tour DLC Confirmed | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | first=Chris | last=Faylor | date=2009-05-15 | accessdate=2009-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock'', and for a small fee, some songs from both ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' and ''Guitar Hero Smash Hits'' can be exported to both ''Guitar Hero 5'' and ''Band Hero'', limited by music licensing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign gh5 hands-on&quot;/&gt; Activision has also stated that they are considering a monthly [[subscription business model|subscription service]] to deliver downloadable content to user for future games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54774 | title=Guitar Hero DLC Subscription Being Evaluated by Activision, Plans to Make Lots of Money | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-09-16 | accessdate=2008-09-16 | first=Blake | last=Ellison}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Guitar Hero World Tour'' introduced a music creation mode that will allow players to create and share songs (excluding vocals) via the &quot;GHTunes&quot; service, which was also used in all other ''Guitar Hero'' games and ''Band Hero'' since its inclusion. The creation tools were improved with ''Guitar Hero 5'' and ''Band Hero'' to allow longer songs and other means of generating songs in real-time.

In the first two games and the 2007 expansion ''[[Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s]]'', the majority of the songs on the main career mode set lists are [[cover version|covers]] of the original song; for example, a song may be presented as &quot;''[[Free Bird]] as made famous by [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent gh influence&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/rocktastic-how-guitar-hero-brought-stardom-to-the-masses-1669257.html | title=Rocktastic: How Guitar Hero brought stardom to the masses | publisher=[[The Independent]] | date=2009-04-16 | accessdate=2009-04-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'' introduces a much larger range of original recordings, and ''World Tour'' featured a setlist that contained all [[master recording]]s.  The covers throughout the games are mostly recreated by [[WaveGroup Sound]] who has worked before to create songs for ''[[Beatmania]]'', ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/creating-the-songs-behind-guitar-hero-iii/71088/?biz=1 | title=Creating the Songs Behind ''Guitar Hero III'' | date=2007-10-24 | accessdate=2007-10-24 | publisher=GameBizDaily | first=Michael | last=Mullen}}&lt;/ref&gt; making small changes to the guitar portions to make them more adaptable for gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/news/2008/08/soundalikes | title=Guitar Hero, Rock Band and the Rock 'n' Roll Money Machine | publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] | first=Bill | last=Hochberg | date=2008-08-02 | accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all of the unlockable bonus songs are songs performed by the original artist for the game (the only exception is the song &quot;[[She Bangs the Drums]]&quot; by [[The Stone Roses]], which is featured in ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'').

Prior to the release of ''Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock'', Activision worked with the [[iTunes Store]] to provide more than 1300 tracks of ''Guitar Hero''-related music across more than 20 compilations, including most of the tracks from the games in the series, called &quot;''Guitar Hero Essentials''&quot;. These compilations, such as &quot;''Killer Guitar Solos''&quot; and &quot;''Guitar Anthems of the &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;80s''&quot;, include songs related to but not contained within the ''Guitar Hero'' series. Dusty Welch of RedOctane stated, &quot;Where thereâs music, thereâs ''Guitar Hero'', and with iTunes, we are able to provide fans with a central location for downloading their favorite rock anthems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20071023005891&amp;newsLang=en | title=''Guitar Hero Essentials'' Now Available on iTunes | date=2007-10-23 | accessdate=2007-10-23 | publisher=[[Activision]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the merger of Activision and Blizzard, the new company announced that it planned on creating an alternative to iTunes based on the ''Guitar Hero'' brand that would allow for downloading songs and their associated note tracks for the ''Guitar Hero'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/39a8e912-4ee0-11dd-ba7c-000077b07658.html | title=Activision aims to take on iTunes | publisher=[[Financial Times]] | first=Matthew | last=Garrahan | coauthors=Nutrall, Chris | date=2008-07-10 | accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal and practical issues==
===PlayStation 3 incompatibility===
Sony's [[PlayStation 3]] console has no compatibility with the [[PlayStation 2]] ''Guitar Hero'' controller on the system. While ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Guitar Hero II'' are fully backward-compatible through the hardware PlayStation 2 emulation in the initial North American release of the console, it was impossible at launch to use the guitar controller to play either game. Kai Huang, of RedOctane, states that they are &quot;working on that with Sony right now â looking at how we can get all the PlayStation 2 guitars that are out there, and all the owners of them, to use them on the PlayStation 3.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=75391&amp;page=1|title=Eurogamer â Guitar Hero III's Rock 'N' Slide Star|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nyko]], an accessories company, was poised to make a special PlayStation 2 controller adapter for the PlayStation 3, but has put the product on hold due to technical difficulties. Also, Tac, another accessories company also made a PlayStation 3 adapter for a PlayStation 2 to a PlayStation 3 game console so people can use their ''Guitar Hero'' guitar controllers that were made for PlayStation 2 to be used with a PlayStation 3 game console.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/nyko/nyko-clarifies-guitar-hero-adaptor-cancellation-248586.php|title=Kotaku: Nyko explains issues with ''Guitar Hero'' adapter|publisher=Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the May 2007 PlayStation 3 V1.80 system update has made the guitar controller compatible with generic PlayStation 2 controller to USB adapters when playing ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Guitar Hero II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://forum.guitarherogame.com/Default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=18480|title=Making the controller work on PS3|work=guitarherogame.com forums}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Pelican Accessories|Pelican]] has released a special PlayStation 2 to PlayStation 3 controller adapter that supports both games, including the ability to switch the handedness of the guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-01|url=http://www.aeropause.com/2007/05/will-pelicans-usb-adapter-let-you-play-guitar-hero-on-the-ps3/|title=Aeropause â Will Pelican's USB Adapter Let You ''Guitar Hero'' on PS3?|publisher=Aeropause}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, most PS2-to-USB adapters have issues with [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s. [[The Ant Commandos]] have produced an adapter that allows hammer-ons to be played. This is the only known adapter that allows this, however it is only designed and guaranteed for using PlayStation 2 guitar controllers with PlayStation 3 ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Rock Band'' games and as such is incompatible with ''Guitar Hero II'' and ''Rock the 80s''.  Both games can still be played using the shoulder buttons on a standard controller.

===Patent litigation===
[[Gibson Guitar Corporation]], whose guitar likenesses have appeared in the ''Guitar Hero'' series from the first game to ''Guitar Hero Aerosmith'', informed Activision on January 7, 2008, that it believed the games infringe its {{US patent|5990405}}. Gibson claimed that this covers technology that simulates a concert performance via pre-recorded audio and a musical instrument. In response, Activision filed a suit seeking a declaration that it was not in violation of the Gibson patent; Activision also asserted that Gibson had given an implied license by [[laches (equity)|waiting to assert the patent]] and that the patent was invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN1222156920080312 | title=Activision's ''Guitar Hero'' violates patent: Gibson | publisher=''[[Reuters|Reuters News]]'' | author=Scott Hillis | coauthors=Gina Keating | date=2008-03-12 | accessdate=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 17, 2008, Gibson sued six retailers ([[GameStop]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Wal-Mart]], [[Target Corporation|Target]], [[Toys &quot;R&quot; Us]] and [[Kmart]]) for selling ''Guitar Hero'' products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/51860 | title=Gibson Sues Retailers for Selling ''Guitar Hero'' | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-03-20 | accessdate=2008-03-30 | first=Chris | last=Faylor }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  | url=http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080320_.x | title=Press Statement from Gibson Guitar in Regards to ''Guitar Hero'' Retailer Lawsuit  | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-03-20 | accessdate=2008-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, on March 21, 2008, Gibson also filed a lawsuit against EA, MTV, and Harmonix over their game ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' also for violation of its patent, to which a Harmonix spokesperson stated that Gibson's claims are &quot;completely without merit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/51876 | title=Gibson Sues EA, MTV, Harmonix over Rock Band; Update: Harmonix Responds, Denies Allegations | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-03-21 | accessdate=2008-03-21 | first=Chris | last=Faylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Activision lawyer Mary Tuck stated in their legal filings that they believe that Gibson initiated the lawsuit due to the fact that &quot;Activision was not &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;interested&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in renewing the License and Marketing Support Agreement&quot; with Gibson Guitars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1583874/20080321/id_0.jhtml | title=Gibson Guitar Company Sues Retailers, MTV Over 'Guitar Hero' And 'Rock Band' | publisher=MTV | date=2008-03-21 | accessdate=2008-03-26 | first=Stephen |last=Totilo }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2009, the United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled against Gibson in their case against Activision, stating that the controllers are not musical instruments but &quot;toys that represent other items&quot;, and that Gibson's patent only covers instruments that send out analog signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/02/gibson-loses-guitar-hero-patent-lawsuit-booed-off-stage/ | title=Gibson loses Guitar Hero patent lawsuit, gets booed off stage | first=Nilay | last=Patel | date=2009-03-02 | accessdate=2009-03-02 | publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | litigants=Activision Publishers, Inc. vs Gibson Guitars Corp. | court=United States District Court, Central District of California | date=2009-02-26 | url=http://stadium.weblogsinc.com/engadget/files/gh_ruling.PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Activision and Gibson settled the suit following this ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23351 | title=Activision, Gibson Settle Latest Suit | date=2009-04-24 | accessdate=2009-04-24 | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | first=Kris | last=Graft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Activision was sued by the Patent Compliance Group (PCG) for releasing ''Guitar Hero'' products with false patent claims, with the PCG asserting that games like ''Guitar Hero 5'' and ''Band Hero'' were marked with up to 10 patents that are not used within the games along with several other improper [[patent pending]] claims. PCG claims that &quot;Acts of false marketing deter innovation and stifle competition in the marketplace.&quot; PCG's ''[[qui tam]]'' lawsuit is seeking up to $500 per unit sold if Activision is found liable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thresq.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/02/band-hero.html#more | title=Lawsuit challenges 'Guitar Hero' ads claiming patent | first=Eriq | last=Gardner | date=2010-02-19 | accessdate =2010-02-22 | work=[[The Hollywood Report]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large number of ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Rock Band'' titles on the market is considered to be partially responsible for the sharp decline of music game sales in the latter half of 2009, along with the effects of the [[late-2000s recession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;escapistmagazine1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;computerandvideogames1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/12/22/despite-the-beatles-rock-band-music-video-game-sales-slip-in-09/ | title=Despite &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band,&quot; Music Video Game Sales Slip in '09 | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=2009-12-22 | accessdate=2010-01-30 | first=Daniel | last=Kreps }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra&quot; /&gt; The market for rhythm games was $1.4 billion in 2008, but dropped to $700 million in 2009 even though more titles were available that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;market size&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/12/18/technology/tech-us-2009-games.html | title=Sales Of Music Video Games Plummet In 2009 | publisher=Reuters | date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2009-12-20 }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Neversoft]] project director Brian Bright noted that at one point in 2009, they were responsible for the release of three games that year (''Guitar Hero 5'', ''Metallica'', and ''Band Hero'') and supporting other studios for the development of two additional games, causing the studio to lose the focus both in development and marketing efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;bright develop&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.develop-online.net/news/35573/Neversoft-on-selling-out-in-the-race-for-sales | title = Neversoft on 'selling out' in the race for sales | publisher = [[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] | date = 2010-08-09 | accessdate = 2010-08-09 | first = Rob | last = Crossley }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bright, sales of all the ''Guitar Hero'' games released in 2009 totaled the number of sales of the 2008 title ''World Tour'', demonstrating the dilution of the marketing.&lt;ref name=&quot;bright develop&quot;/&gt; Though Activision had originally planned on tripling the offerings of the ''Guitar Hero'' series in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?story=53961 | title=More Call of Duty and Guitar Hero Sequels in 2009 | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2008-07-31 | accessdate=2008-07-31 |first=Chris | last=Faylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;three expansions&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19682 | title=Analyst: Three Expansion Packs Possible For Next Guitar Hero | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | first=Leigh | last=Alexander | date=2008-08-01 | accessdate=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54746 | title=Activision Tripling Guitar Hero Releases by 2010 | first=Chris | last=Faylor | date=2008-09-15 | accessdate=2008-09-16 | publisher=[[Shacknews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company readjusted their plans, reducing the number of offerings and focusing more on selling digital [[downloadable content]] for the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcvuk.com/features/584/Heroic-Deeds | title=Heroic Deeds | first=Michael | last=French | date=2009-11-13 | accessdate=2009-11-17 | publisher=[[MCVUK]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two titles, ''Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock'' and ''DJ Hero 2'' were set for release in 2010;&lt;ref name=&quot;vg247 2010 skus&quot; /&gt; both sequels were scheduled for the &quot;back half of 2010&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/62328 | title=Activision Breaks Down 2010 Release Schedule: Singularity in June, Transformers by July, More | publisher=[[Shacknews]] | date=2010-02-11 | accessdate=2010-02-11 | first=Chris | last=Faylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts believe that the market will evolve to support a smaller number of titles each year, averaging at a &quot;healthy&quot; value $500â600 million in revenues annually.&lt;ref name=&quot;market size&quot;/&gt; Kotick believed that part of the downfall of ''Guitar Hero'' was due to Activision introduction of ''DJ Hero'', which they focused too much on and left the core ''Guitar Hero'' games without the &quot;nourishment and care&quot; needed to continue to innovate in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes kotick july11&quot;/&gt;

Activision Publishing chief executive Mike Griffith, in response to questions about Activision's approach to the ''Guitar Hero'' market, noted that ''Guitar Hero'' continues to outsell the ''Rock Band'' series in both number of sales and revenue, with consumers continuing to buy the separate games on the market, and considered the market acceptance of the multiple games as validation for their model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.industrygamers.com/news/activision-guitar-hero-better-serves-consumers-than-rock-band/ | title=Activision: Guitar Hero Better Serves Consumers Than Rock Band | first=James | last=Brightman | publisher=[[Industry Gamers]] | date=2009-07-01 | accessdate=2009-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, after releasing 25 different SKUs (between games and bundle packages) in 2009, Activision opted to reduce the number of 10 SKUs in 2010, recognizing the music game genre was not as profitable as it once was.&lt;ref name=&quot;vg247 2010 skus&quot;/&gt; Activision eventually opted to hold off future development of the series in early 2011 citing weak sales in the rhythm game genre, a move that many journalists attributed to Activision's earlier oversaturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ds.ign.com/articles/114/1148887p1.html | title = The Lobby: Guitar Hero's Demise | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2011-02-09 | accessdate = 2011-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2011/feb/10/guitar-hero-axed | title = Guitar Hero axed: five reasons why music games are dying | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 2011-02-10 | accessdate = 2011-02-10 | first= Keith | last = Stuart }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2011/02/09/rip-guitar-hero-2005-2011/ | title = RIP Guitar Hero: 2005â2011? | first= Gieson | last = Cacho | date = 2011-02-09 | accessdate = 2011-02-10 | work = [[San Jose Mercury News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/games/article/936421--guitar-hero-gets-axed?bn=1 | title = Guitar Hero gets axed | date= 2011-02-10 | accessdate = 2011-02-10 | first = Raju | last = Mudhar | work = [[Toronto Star]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
